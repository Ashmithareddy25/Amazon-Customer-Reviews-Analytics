B006OCM0G0|5.0|GO TEAM LAVA! ! !  I love this game, it was super-fun to play.  Waiting for the food to cook and stuff makes you more patient.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome game. I could play for days on end and not stop once for a break. highly addictive. especially bow and arrow games.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I love this game. I got hooked at university where friends and I would play late into the night in our dining room. It's simple to learn, very social, and nothing is more fun than screaming ORE and WHEAT (with dramatic emphasis on the H) while building roads to to dash your friend's hopes of empire.<br /><br />This game is the right price, it's good fun, it's a fast game, and it will stand up to a fairly good beating. Sure the parts and game board are mostly paper based but they are easily kept track of (even if a bit small). I would not recommend for kids who love to threaten their own lives by eating game pieces, anyone over 7 could handle the basics of the game though.<br /><br />Start settling! You'll have a good time.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Hunger Games is a must read. They are amazing books! Very, very fun to read! Great for all ages and the movie turned out great!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have never finished a book so fast, I couldn't put the book down! It was a great book and would read it again!
B0031S4K5E|5.0|Ponyo is loosely based on Hans Christian Anderson's \\"The Little Mermaid.\\" Miyazaki really made this his own movie though. The animation is hand-drawn and looks amazing! And the characters of the film are adorable. This film reminds me of the good old days of animation. Both adults and children will love this movie! The little plush ponyo that comes along with the dvd is adorable, but since I'm a stickler for details, they should have made her hair orange like in the movie instead of brown.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|very  much enojyed this book! kept me very on the edge of my seat with scary excitment! loved this book!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was hard to put down, it was an easy and enjoyable read and I would recommend it to friends family or strangers! :)
B0086700CM|4.0|its fun at first but then it gets kind of boring /pointless after a while cause you just cant win it there's no end no goal but it still is really fun and the different characters and powerups are cool. I think any one should get it. so glad they brought it to kindle fire / aneroid app store
B0063GORYU|4.0|I like how easy it is to move through the game and it's  very addictive. Its  a lot simpler than other versions I've  played.
B00355L2TU|4.0|This is a pretty good DVD. It gets me sweating for sure. I wouldn't say it's the hardest workout ever, but it's good if you have a busy schedule. To see results I feel like you need to stick with it religiously, and maybe even add some of your own cardio in ok the side. Defiantly make sure you get the right size hand weights too, or it can make the workout a little difficult.
B001P5M7QE|5.0|I have never laughed as much as the first time I watched \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail.\\"  It is quite simply the funniest movie ever made.  Period.  Full stop. End of story.  A big claim to make, but an entirely justifiable one.  Its a very well made film, full of classic sketches, eminently quotable lines, and some very good comic acting too.<br /><br />MPATHG is unquestionably Monty Python's masterpiece, funnier than the needlessly offensive, overhyped and badly paced \\"Life of Brian\\" and much, much better than \\"Meaning of Life\\".  Sure it isn't perfect - the ending is weak and Gilliam's animations look a bit self-indulgent and more than a little tired, but you only notice those disadvantages because the rest of this film is so good the faults stand out in comparison.
B005TBWN0K|5.0|This app is Simple &amp; Fun!!!!  It works great with my Kindle Fire!!  I will definately recommend this app to friends!
B006RUJST6|2.0|What I learned through this book is to stop trusting Amazon reviews. The book held my interest and was funny at times. I can see how a teen would enjoy it over summer vacation or something, but it's not great literature and definitely not for adults. I didn't find myself caring about the characters. The main character is 18 and immature and I didn't see what the guy loved about her. Their falling in love wasn't that convincing and was more like a teen infatuation. I would have liked more depth. I'm not buying the sequel since the first book didn't leave me caring about whether they end up together.
B0062GM6FS|4.0|The creative force of this \\"autobio,\\" as well as<br />the person who wrote it all, is superbo journalist<br />James Fox who also wrote \\"White Mischief,\\" the true<br />crimer of sex, lies and drugs among UK aristos in<br />Africa, 1941. It's the Keith Richards story, for sure,<br />but don't be fooled by the credits, which is true of<br />all celeb tomes.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I first read the summary of the book, I was not impressed and decided not to read it.  I was then dragged to see the movie and LOVED it, so I decided to read the book since so many reviews said that the book is better than the movie.  They were definitely right! The movie does not do the book any justice.  There is so much detail and you get a true understanding of why the trilogy was written in the first place.  I could not put it down and certainly recommend it, even if you are not into Sci-Fi.
0375424474|5.0|My training and experience was in petroleum geology and geophysics, so paleontology was never a strong suit.  And microbiology, though interesting, was something I didn't know much about either.  This book examines the physiological and biological similarities between all vertebrates and even non-vertebrates.  I had no idea how similar, physiologically, all vertebrates are.  I was fascinated by the examination of gene switching experiments over the last 100 years that have discovered how physiological traits can be altered in similar genes in different animals.  It was utterly fascinating!  The microbiology was not so deep that I couldn't follow and understand the discussions.  I've since bought several copies to give to friends and relatives.  Very much recommended.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I usually do not read romance novels, I prefer mystery, suspense or horror, but, this book was recommended to me by a friend so I read it for the porn. It is great porn, much better than other romance novels that I forced myself to read because of a recommendation and hated them all. I planned to just buy the first book and then reread the porn sections when ever I wanted instead of buying any more books in the trilogy. However, by the end of the first book I was interested enough in the story to get the other two books in the trilogy. The plot is thin and predictable, but mildly entertaining, enough to keep my interest, the porn is great and worth the price of the ebook.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|Wife's Ipod adapater in her car used to work fine with her old ipod.  Then the ipod was recalled and she got a new one.  The new one wouldn't charge or work normally in the car.  After head scratching and research I realized it was due to the change Ipods made to their adapters and quickly found this cheap but functional solution.<br /><br />Works great and wife's been happy with it.  Also works in my '05 Lexus' Ipod adapter.

B005LAIGIM|5.0|Despite its unique premise about a guy who says a word every time a leaf falls off a tree, it's very predictable, to say the least. But Eddie Murphy is charming and hilarious as always. I was looking forward to it for a while, and it's definitely worth the wait, needless to say. Murphy isn't in the movies as much anymore, but I am looking forward to what he does next!

All I have is a cooler master air cooler with 2x80mm fans on it and I have never gone above 40C.<br />Great processor! The throttling issues are kind of annoying but I can still push this thing more if I took the time to tweak it. Way to go AMD!

1400069289|5.0|Following a prologue in which a subject transforms utterly transforms herself, Duhigg lays out the structure of the book.  \\"Part One: The Habits of Individuals\\" is broken into three chapters.<br /><br />Chapter 1, \\"The Habit Loop\\" describes the (wait for it...) the habit loop, which is the foundation for everything that follows.  This is a 3-step process, in which a cue triggers a routine which is reinforced by a reward.  Duhigg does a great job of describing the science that describes this pattern, and the science which explains it, without making the information so dry that you can't absorb it.<br /><br />Chapter 2, \\"The Craving Brain,\\" examines individuals who suffered neurological damage and the impact that habits had on their ability to perform various functions and routines.  This chapter had heart: imagining the daily lives of these individuals and their caregivers brought some real drama to the study of how habits operate in our brains.  The point of the chapter was basically that habits are surprisingly delicate, to use Duhigg's term, and can be easily disrupted, with the right information.<br /><br />Chapter 3, \\"The Golden Rule of Habit Change: Why Transformation Occurs\\" focused on the coaching career of of NFL coach Tony Dungy, and how he used his understanding of habits to transform the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Indiana Colts.  The Golden Rule is You can't extinguish a bad habit, you can only change it.  Midway through Chapter 3 Duhigg breaks away from NFL to consider Alcoholics Anonymous.  If Chapter 2 is the heart of Part One, then Chapter 3 is the soul: both AA and Dungy's football program achieve their greatest success when the people operating under their respective guidance both arrive at belief in something greater than the individual.  Duhigg shares more than that in this chapter, but there is a ton of information in this chapter about how habits can be disrupted to make way for more positive patterns.<br /><br />In Chapter 4, \\"Keystone Habits, Or the Ballad of Paul O'Neill: Which Habits Matter Most,\\" Duhigg offers Paul O'Neill of Alcoa to illustrate how altering a single habit in an organization (albeit in a highly focused and disciplined manner) can transform the total organization.<br /><br />Chapter 5, \\"Starbucks and the Habit of Success,\\" opens with a powerful story of a young man who was raised by drug addicts, and his subsequent struggles to maintain his employment.  His pattern of failure changed when he went to work at Starbucks.  This chapter discusses the importance of willpower and its limitations, how willpower can be strengthened, and planning for success.<br /><br />Chapter 6, \\"The Power of a Crisis,\\" uses the examples of doctor error in a Rhode Island hospital, which Duhigg asserts was made inevitable by the toxic atmosphere in the workplace, and a fire in King's Cross Station, London, which was made inevitable by strictly observed divisions of labor, to provide opportunities for transforming the cultures of those two organizations into something stronger and more effective than could have been created as Paul O'Neill did, just by sheer force of leadership.<br /><br />Chapter 7, \\"How Target Knows What You Want Before You Do\\" is probably the most widely read section of the book, as it was excerpted by the New York Times (Duhigg's employer) and Forbes, among others.  It's readable and informative, and fairly creepy in disclosing how much information we unwittingly distribute about ourselves, and how unlikely we are to curtail the activities that make it possible for Target to know a woman is pregnant before any of her immediate family members do.<br /><br />Several reviewers have described these sections as \\"filler,\\" but I found that they addressed complaints common to people who claim to want to change their habits but lack willpower, and provided guideposts to an attentive reader for what qualities set one up for success. I did not find these sections to be filler, but powerful illustrations of how a thorough understanding of the mechanisms behind habits can provide the tools for large scale change, and a discussion of the nature of personal responsibility.  Although the sections were more directly addressing corporate bodies, the information was driven by the individuals within those organizations and therefore applicable to me and my own private attempts to alter my habits.<br /><br />Part Three was an interesting summing up.  Chapter 8, \\"Saddleback Church and the Montgomery Bus Boycott\\" addressed the components that made those movements (if one can call a mega-church a movement) successful.  The Montgomery Bus Boycott, particularly, was really interesting: we celebrate Rosa Parks's heroism, deservedly, but the fact is, several other individuals had made similar stands without sparking the Civil Rights Movement.  Duhigg's explanation for why Parks had the right stuff to make it happen makes for informative reading (the short version being, Parks was a genuinely nice and widely connected member of Montgomery society).<br /><br />Chapter 9, \\"The Neurology of Free Will: Are We Responsible for Our Habits?\\" puts all the preceding information in perspective.  It contrasts Brian Thomas, an Englishman who killed his wife while sleepwalking, with Angie Bachmann, a compulsive gambler who lost many hundreds of thousands of dollars.  He describes the neurology of sleepwalking activity and of a compulsive activity such as gambling (or drinking, or binge eating) and concludes that habits are under are control and can be altered, which argues for self-awareness and personal responsibility.<br /><br />The information provided in the body of the book was enough for me to understand how to create a road map for how to change my habits, but Duhigg did provide a digest of the material in his Appendix, \\"A Reader's Guide to Using These Ideas.\\" Overall, I found this book to be both readable and powerful, and I look forward to implementing what I've learned to further my own goals.ons of how a thorough understanding of the mechanisms behind habits can provide the tools for large scale change, and a discussion of the nature of personal responsibility.

B005Q1W0ZQ|1.0|The third disc cannot be played in Australia.  Amazon took no action to remedy this situation regardless of my complaints - simply sent me another unusable product!.  This product was so bad I have now opted to exercise my purchasing through a US website rather than Amazon.
B00633W614|1.0|The ending was absolutely terrible. Archer is a great author, he should be embarrassed to have his name on this book.
0547258305|3.0|Before I read this book, I was told that it's a book you either love or hate. Well, I'm ambivalent. I don't think I would recommend it, but I wouldn't steer anyone away either. The story is alright, the fictional world created by the author is alright.... it just seems that everything is okay. Nothing is absolutely amazing. I wanted to know more about the gracelings and their different powers and how they worked. Basically, the whole story went in a direction I found somewhat boring. The base of the plot was shaky at best; there was no concrete reason for what happened in the story to really CREATE the story and the protagonist is really hard to like.<br /><br />It's not that she's a terrible person, but she's just very difficult and very angsty. She doesn't like traditional things for reasons that are really rather strange and poorly explained and she gets angry for literally absolutely no reason too often for my tastes. The other characters are flimsy and two-dimensional. Despite all these negative critiques though, I finished the book and enjoyed the world it had created enough to stick it on my shelf instead of passing it along. I don't know if I'll read more, since it was frustrating to have the story go off all over the place, but overall, it wasn't a terrible book and it wasn't an amazing book. It just very....bleh.

B005LAIIRQ|1.0|I hate war, prison, and people dying movies, seeing the previews it looked like Liam Nesson was going to kick some wolf ass, but no its everybody dying/slaughtered and of course they saved the star to be butchered last, hate, hate this movie, thank God I rented it, and of course Neflix did their usual, with their DVD's you can only watch the movie, not any of the special features, including the commentary, I wouldnt even take this sad depressing movie if it were free, angry I watched it and felt sad, horrified, and extremely depressed, boo
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is very fun but the games could cost less points but they are very fun but it is very gun
B000V659OU|5.0|I absolutely love this story. Reminds me of my father and the wonderful tales he entertained us with growing up.  All families have their dysfunctions, but through it all, the love rings true! Such a colorful life this man shared with his son and you can't help but admire the love he felt for his wife as well as all the people who were graced to share everyday with!  So nice to have a movie that you can share with friends and your children--no violence or sex, just wonderful stories of everyday people who spin a unique mystic to everyday life!
B006UAWH2S|4.0|I agree with most of the other reviewers on this one.  Perfect sense has a measured pace, an unusually effective narrative style, and a theme that evokes emotion at stunning, unexpected moments...disturbing, human, tender.  I think I might love this movie.
B007X15GRQ|1.0|Bleak, poorly acted, cliche plot, awful direction, little or no action in the first part of the movie (full disclosure: stopped watching because it was so awful). And those are the good points.
0312360258|3.0|When I first read this series I was in 7th grade and fell in love with this series. Now a `mature' junior in high school, it seems not well-written and the plot seems to be not thought out and scrapped together. Don't get me wrong the books still do keep my interest, and I'm not dreading the turn of each page, but the stories in this series are fairly predictable and feel dragged out without too much of a point. I have no clue what these books are leading up to as `the grand finale' (the last book), and I'm pretty sure neither does P.C and Kirsten Cast. It seems impossible that they'll manage to tie all these books together somehow with a pretty bow, like other authors do.<br /><br />The main character `Zoey Redbird' (the last name comes from her grandmas nickname for her) is a sweet, relatable main character, but all the good things that happen to her, such and catching the eye of Mr. Handsome-the most popular guy at school, and defeating the `mean girl' makes this book seem way to fake to be true. Throughout this series starting with the third book, I started to feel myself not liking Zoey more and more.  SPOILER ALERT- I honestly was happy when she died and Stevie Rae her best friend had the main point of view throughout the story, and had a `beauty and the beast' romance with a unlikely character.<br /><br />Now if I have so many complaints about this book then why 3 stars? This book does have lighthearted fun, and cheesy catch phrases. When I was in middle school my group of friends and I called ourselves the `nerd heard' (Zoey and her groups self proclaimed name), and we all named ourselves after characters from the book. I myself was Zoey- I'm not sure why though...<br /><br />I would recommend this book and its series for mature (it does have some PG-13/Rated R) scenes in it middle school  kids who want light hearted fun and don't care about an overall plot to a book.

B006YRVY2G|4.0|All the greatness that the first season of Sherlock had to offer returns once again in the second series. David Arnold & Michael Price expand on their modern Sherlock Holmes world. This time around the duo expand the soundscape a bit to make it have more substance and it tones down on the quirky side. The score represented on the album is structured quite nicely; as the music progresses we delve into deeper darker bits of score.<br /><br />The first series had some great music, but I found there to be a lacking uniqueness to it all. It tried to play the quirkiness that Hans Zimmer nailed on the head in the film incarnation, and it felt like it forgot that it was a modern adaptation. This time around Arnold and Price move away from that soundscape of the first season and do indeed bring the series a modern and more developed feel. The music is richer with great motifs, and the music is to be taken seriously. There is a great emotional weight to the score, especially in the second half when things really get going. Arnold and Price aren't afraid to use electronics, which is a great thing. The electronics in some of the tracks definitely give the score the modern feel it needs. All in all the music is moving in such a great direction while building off of everything they did in the first season.<br /><br />Sherlock is a terrific effort from David Arnold and Michael Price. The music finds a good balance of classic orchestrations and synth textures. The way the music builds and crafts drama is impressive, and it always keeps the listener engrossed. Series 2 is a much stronger effort than Series 1 as it seems the music has finally found its footing. Recurring motifs make the score that much stronger in what's an incredibly enjoyable experience.
B007I2BZIE|3.0|Let me first say that it does my heart good to see so many five-star reviews.  Rush is one of my favorites and I love seeing the support and the adulations.  I almost feel bad not adding another five-star review to the page, but I couldn't do that when I don't believe it.<br /><br />I think you have to look at Clockwork Angels in two different ways: musically and lyrically.  Musically I would give this album six stars out of five.  Truly this is evidence of three stellar musicians at the top of their game, with excellently mixed songs devoid of the almost forced clutter of Snakes and Arrow.  I even loved being able to pick out sound tropes here and there that made me say, \\"Wow, that sounds like it could have come from Signals/Caress of Steel/Test for Echo/pick a dang album; I wonder if that was intentional or a happy accident?\\"  Honestly this could have been a largely instrumental affair and I wouldn't have felt cheated in the slightest.<br /><br />Lyrically, though, is where I had problems with this album.  Overall I can't call myself a fan of \\"concept albums\\" in general -- it's a tricky thing to pull off and pull off well.  And technically Rush have never had a true concept album, just a few concept A-sides (\\"2112,\\" \\"Hemispheres\\") and less well-received concept B-sides (\\"The Necromancer\\" & \\"The Fountains of Lamneth\\").  I won't say there aren't fantastic songs on Clockwork Angels -- I think that when it works, it works exceedingly well.  BU2B, The Wreckers and Headlong Flight are all tremendous tracks both lyrically and musically.  The problem with many of the other songs is that they feel shoehorned into a concept that I don't think works very well to begin with; in fact, unless you read the liner notes and get the little snippets of storyline (I'm sure these will be expanded on in the novel) they don't particularly tell a story.  That's the issue -- a concept album tells a coherent story from beginning to end.  \\"2112\\" did this, as did \\"Hemispheres.\\"  Even the epics from Caress of Steel told full stories.  I just don't feel that Clockwork Angels nailed it in this respect.<br /><br />But, as a Rush fan, I'm glad to hear them busting out the heavy guns again and I eagerly await their next release.  Keep up the good works, fellas!
B007TBCTRK|4.0|I feel as if Marc Streitenfeld has been under the industry microscope ever since he became Ridley Scott's go-to composer. He has never done a score without Ridley being involved in some fashion. His only two non-Ridley directed films are Welcome To The Riley's and The Grey; both are produced by Ridley Scott. Never has the microscope been more focused than for Prometheus; undoubtedly the biggest score of his career so far. I never had any doubts, but some people did. Then word got out that Harry Gregson-Williams had to come in to help with additional music. Why is this a big deal for many? I have no idea. The result is an absolutely masterful effort on Streitenfeld's part only enhanced by the grandiose wonder Harry brought to the table.<br /><br />Prometheus' score is such a complex soundscape of different layers, tones and melodies that all blend into this mysteriously wonderful terror. It's clear that Harry was brought in to give the film some big cosmic and existential theme, which is what he did. A theme that is referenced a few times throughout the film. It serves as an anchoring point but it blends so perfectly with what Streitenfeld did. Clearly Streitenfeld and Harry worked together on this one as you can hear this motif in the track \\"Earth\\", which is credited to Streitenfeld. So to say that Harry \\"rescued\\" the film is completely inaccurate. The other 99% of the score by Streitenfeld is dark, brooding and at times thrilling. The music builds on you and is never boring. The score is structured almost perfectly and in the film it plays such a major role as music always does in a Ridley Scott film. The subtle undertones work very well as do the big overt cues. The film is driven by the score and as a musically conscious viewer I felt this score working over me every step of the way. It builds such a solid universe and it feels brand new. Streitenfeld references Jerry Goldsmith's Alien theme ever so slightly in \\"Friend From The Past\\"; a perfect track title.<br /><br />Prometheus is a splendid wonder of brilliant scoring. It hits all the right beats and shows how talented the young Marc Streitenfeld is when it comes to hitting the right emotions. Harry's wondrous theme doesn't steal the show as some people may lead you to believe. It serves as a perfect accent to the already masterful score. Prometheus is a richly composed score that holds this great beast of a film together.<br />Prometheus is a splendid wonder of brilliant scoring.

B00846REIS|4.0|-- A Romantic Book Affairs Review<br /><br />I'll start by addressing the elephant in the room - you know, that book everyone is talking about. Fifty Shades of Grey. Have I read it? Well, I read the first four or five chapters... Which isn't enough to give an opinion on the story itself, but was more than enough to form an opinion on the writing. And my opinion is decidedly negative. No matter how great a story it might be, with writing that bad... It's not for me.<br /><br />So while people will draw comparisons between Fifty and Bared to You, and there are quite a few similarities, Bared to You is infinitely and exponentially the more well written of the two.<br /><br />Now that that's off my chest... Let's forget about that other book and focus on Eva Tramell and Gideon Cross, shall we?<br /><br />I will admit that the first person narrative was jarring at first. It isn't terribly common in romance novels, as it limits the character perspective, and I know that some absolutely refuse to read a first person romance... but I thought it worked well with this story and I didn't find it to be a big deal at all. It certainly made Gideon all the more mysterious.<br /><br />And mysterious he is... and secretive and unreadable. After reading the book in its entirety, I still don't feel like I know who Gideon Cross is. I know that he's rich (an understatement, really) and devastatingly good-looking. He owns half of Manhattan and dresses impeccably. He's estranged from his family. He is riddled with deep emotional scars. And he likes to be in control at all times. I found Gideon to be quite the puzzle--albeit a very smexy one.<br /><br />As our narrator, Eva is much more transparent. All of her secrets are shared with us throughout... and each one revealed is quite the doozy. From the beginning, you know that Eva's life hasn't been the pretty picture it seems. However, it isn't until the middle of the book that you find out just how not pretty it really is. And it explained a lot about her. It's no surprise that Eva is easily jealous. That she's more flight than fight.<br /><br />Eva and Gideon's relationship can only be described as dysfunctional... but working on it. It starts out as physical attraction and blossoms into two kindred souls seeking understanding and comfort. The growth in their relationship was unusual, to say the least. There wasn't very much talking between them--it was more so feeling between them. At one point, Eva asks, \\"Is it possible for two abuse survivors to have a functional romantic relationship?\\" And I believe that sums them up quite nicely. Two victims of s-xual abuse trying to make their relationship work. It added depth to the story, gave reason to the times when there was s-x, s-x, s-x instead of much needed heart-to-heart conversations.<br /><br />This is very character-driven story. There is no plot, per say. The plot is the characters and their relationship with each other. Their journey. Even though Eva and Gideon are both adults in their twenties, it had that first love/grand romance thing going for it. An all-consuming, can't-get-enough-of-you, need you - want you - love you, love at first sight kind of romance.<br /><br />It is a wild ride, that's for sure. A whiplashing, emotional rollercoaster. And, just to warn you: the end is rather abrupt. Luckily, we only have to wait four months for the next installment - Deeper into You.a lot about her. It's no surprise that Eva is easily jealous.

B005HEUASQ|5.0|This is one of the best episodes of whole series.The plot is excellent far beyond ordinary thinking limitless power between rules versus short life of limits beings. I'm was remember this episode many years until I see it again.Its like searching whole galaxy for soul mate...
B005EGXTEE|4.0|I had no interest in reading this book until a friend told me how much she loved it. I thought it was a teen book. Have to say, loved it. I am now reading the last in in trilogy.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could NOT put this book down!  The writing isn't the greatest, but the story line is wonderful.  This book definitely doesn't deserve 1 star as some people have rated it.  I finally see what everyone is raving about and why it is on the Top Seller List.  I can't stand it when people review the book and give all the details creating a spoiler for someone who might consider reading it, so I'm not going to go into details.  All I can say, is you should read this book if you typically like to read romance novels and the like.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I got through the first two but it's amazing how boring ANYTHING can get when it's on every page of a book.  In my opinion they're just X-rated Harlequin romances.  They pander to the stereotypical female fantasy - not to be a closet masochist  but (against all odds) to conquer the unconquerable man.  He's got a lifetime of \\"proclivities\\" but for some reason ONLY YOU are worthy of his true affection. Everybody wants him but he wants only you.  He knows better than you yourself know your secret desires to be pampered and catered to and he's got the money to do it in ways you've never dared imagine.  Peel back all the layers of female fantasy and - surprise! - there is Christian Grey. In short - I don't get it.  Yes, it's legit porn but I don't know how it's gotten such rave reviews.<br /><br />If this sounds ridiculous, it's because it is!  It sounds like two bored housewives got together with a pitcher of margaritas, pooled their fantasies, sprinkled in a little faux innocence by way of blushes and chewed lips and started typing. The seriously overused farewell adopted by the characters early in the first book, \\"Laters, baby\\", was so supremely annoying that it made me want to poke my eyes out!<br /><br />This gorgeous, over-achieving, perfect, billionaire specimen of a man inexplicably finds himself slavishly devoted to a recent college graduate who, oh yes, just happens to be a virgin.  He's spent his life, all 26 (yes, I said 26) years of it, erecting the Ft. Knox of emotional barriers around himself but, somehow, she manages to demolish them all effortlessly.  Where he was a \\"dominant\\", he is now a \\"romantic\\".  Where he was a \\"sadist\\", he now collapses in tears at the hint that he may lose her. And what of her?  A virgin so out of touch with her body that she apparently had never considered that it might be capable of pleasure suddenly finds herself exhausted from the physical toll of too many orgasms! How many would be too many?  Well, let's see . . . when they're so numerous and intense that you actually fear that you won't survive yet another one?  When you can't remain upright under your own power because you've been too depleted by pleasure?  She certainly adapts quickly for one so untested - no body cavity is out of bounds.  We get to visit each and every one.<br /><br />But wait!  It's not enough that this lightly distressed damsel was rescued from a life of reality by the god of frog princes - he's got a BROTHER!!!  So her BFF gets to live a life of golden bliss, too!  Squeaaaal!  What fun!  It is far-fetched to the point of comedy but takes itself very seriously indeed.  I made it through the first two but have yet to face the third.  I just can't do it but I'm guessing it ends happily.  If it follows the cringeworthy path that's been established, he'll no doubt be domesticated to the point of matrimony and parenthood AND be thrilled about it. If you feel you must read it, be prepared to set aside reason.  It's the only way you'll make it through.re so numerous and intense that you actually fear that you won't survive yet another one?

B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love that I can have multiple alarms set. I work on different days and I never have to think about setting my alarm.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|I enjoy the occasional FPS but I'm tired of building PC's. Portable is more important than power these days. The console is my platform of choice for modern shooters. Ah, but the controller; it is awful. Passable with a lot of practice, but awful.<br /><br />For some reason, the mouse and keyboard are rarely supported on consoles. Probably some \\"even playing field\\" philosophy. Halo proved it could work after slowing everything down so now all shooters are designed for twin sticks. In order to play with friends, got to be on a console. I needed a new controller.<br /><br />My test game is Borderlands. I loved it on PC and want to play it on a PS3 and later play Borderlands 2.<br /><br />I've tried a similar mouse and keyboard product and was not impressed. The precision was just not there and actually made playing worse. I was skeptical the Eagle Eye Converter would be any different. I was wrong. What makes the EEC different is the software that is used to configure the device before plugging into a console. Keys are mapped on a PC and then saved to the device. Up to 2 can be saved to the device at a time and as many as you need saved to your PC.<br /><br />You then plug the EEC into your console along with a mouse and keyboard (check online for a compatibility list). This is where the magic happens and where Eagle Eye stands apart! The device reserves the F1-F8 keys for fine tuning and saving options. F1 is used to eliminate dead zones, F2 for horizontal sensitivity, F3 for vertical, F4 Angle correction, F5 for rotation speed. I only used the first 3 as I found it to be perfect after adjusting those. Tip - turn the sensitivity up all the way in the game options and then back off with these settings for the most control.<br /><br />The EEC also features a really awesome feature where sensitivity settings are stored separately for scope/iron-sight. I configured the EEC to use different values when ever I hold down Right-Mouse. I didn't even know I needed this. Bravo!<br /><br />The instructions were very tricky to understand at first but if followed carefully, it is actually very easy to make these fine tuning adjustments.<br /><br />You can then connect to a PC again and save the final configuration values. Configurations can also be saved to Penguin United's website for others to use. Configurations are available to download for many popular games.<br /><br />Finally, I was able to play an FPS without wanting to throw my controller. No, it is not as good as a PC but it is really close. 9 out of 10 stars close. The number of keys available is limited to the number of buttons on a controller so keys will often play double duty. Also, navigating menus can be a little tricky because you have to memorize where you remapped all the buttons to on the keyboard.<br /><br />If the time is taken to fine tune it for each game, you will play just as well as you do on a PC. Mouse movements are translated well (even minor adjustments). Actions are very smooth. Well worth it.

B008BYXQJY|2.0|I bought the album thinking it included all the songs and it does not.  iTunes just put out a Deluxe album with 16 songs.  I feel like amazon wasn't honest as they led us to think we were purchasing the entire album.  I was also not thrilled with the songs as none of them grabbed me as their prior albums.
B007P6VLRS|1.0|I will admit I'm not the biggest Smashing Pumpkins fan.  I loved Siamese Dreams, and still do, I consider it their best album.  At the time, I found the rest of their output,, as of 97 to be hit and miss, liking more than half of each of the other 4 albums, but also not liking quite a bit from those albums.  A few years ago I went back and gave Gish and Pisces more in depth listens, albums I did like, but didn't love, and they really grew more on me, though I don't understand why they didn't put Drown or Glynis on Pisces since it's technically a b side collection, but whatever.  Thanks to mp3 technology those songs are comfortably in place on that album on my ipod.  I'm only recently going back to Mellon Collie, and I definitely missed a couple gems on that one too.  All this to say what I could have said in a much shorter way, I didn't truly appreciate how good this band was when they were an actual band.  They had something magical about them and it came through in each album.  Then they kicked Jimmy out, or whatever happened during that time.  I'm sure someone will correct me and I honestly don't know the story behind that, and the wheels came off.  Billy, possibly the rest of the band decided they needed to dump being a rock band and put out an electronic album, fitting in with the trends of the late 90's where hard rock was NOT allowed on radio.  Rock bands had to either put out ultra soft alternative albums full of clean electric guitars, NO DISTORTION, or they were banned, or release electronic albums.  So I can't blame Billy for this.  He wanted to stay current.  The album, however, sucked in my opinion and the band has never been the same.  Machina did have a few good songs, 1 I hold in my list of all time favorite Smashing Pumpkins songs, and zeitgeist also contained some songs I enjoyed, but even that album, which featured only 2 of the original members, didn't come close to recapturing what they were, nor anything just as good.  How the title track was left off of versions of that album is beyond me, that was the best song.<br /><br />All this to bring me to this album.  Smashing Pumpkins only in name.  This isn't the same band.  it's Billy Corgan and a bunch of other people.  This didn't work for Axl Rose either.  I will admit I prefer Smashing Pumpkins when they're a rock band, regardless of if it's a heavy song or a softer one, love their version of Landslide, and Disarm and Ruby are 2 of my favorites of their's, but even my opinion on this album isn't based on it not being a heavy album.  The album itself is just boring.  The songs exist.  They're there, for everyone to hear, but they do nothing to make me want to turn the volume up and really pay attention, nor do they stick with e when they're gone.  The album starts with a couple songs that sound like Billy is trying to bring back a little of the old style, but the songs themselves just don't really go anywhere.  Pretty much everything after those are just ballads, and boring ones at that.  I've listened to this album 3 or 4 times and absolutely nothing has stood out.  Not one riff, not one melody, not one drum beat.  Nothing.  I am all for not giving up on an album too soon, but by the second or third listen there should be something to make the listener want to continue listening.  There is nothing here.<br /><br />Obviously my opinion is in the minority, and that's fine.  If you're new to the band, get the first 4 albums, Gish, Siamese Dreams, Pisces Iscariot, and Mellon Collie.  Those are the definitive Smashing Pumpkins albums.  If you like those, then go ahead and listen to the remainder of their discography, but don't expect anything as good as the older albums.  Overall I recommend listening to this for yourself, there are plenty of ways to do so without buying it, and if you like it then buy it.<br /><br />I don't care it's not in the style of the old albums.  I really wanted to like this, but I just can't find any reason to listen to this anymore.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|Personally love this album. It gives Hybrid Theory and Meteora a run for their money.<br /><br />Awesome job LP, keep up the good work!

0345803485|5.0|So this spring, I was listening to Elvis Duran on my way to work, and Danielle was pushing a book- Fifty Shades of Grey by E.L. James. I, being the nonconformist, did exactly what I wouldn't do and downloaded the book as soon as I got home. I read it in a night. I read all three in four days. It started slow and cute in the beginning.... then, it \\"flogged\\" me. If you are buying the book, go ahead and buy the second- Book #1 is a cliff hanger and HOT. Book #2 expands on the relationship, Book #3 wraps it up. What a great trashy read....Brain Candy! The MC is your typical \\"virginal girl next door\\" who falls in love with someone she shouldn't be with. The innate feeling of women is conjured and piqued: You might think it is about sexual gratification in exploratory and extreme fetishes, BUT it's about FIXING THAT BROKEN MAN!!! The faux pas of a man can be changed by an normal and average girl with minimal collateral damage (she ends up picking up his habits/obsessions anyway). It's totally worth the read, your husband/boyfriend will thank you.  [...]

0345803485|1.0|50 shades of the worst book I've ever read! If your hankering for smut, skip to the sex parts and don't waste your time on this horribly written book.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|What was this book really about? Where was it taking us? I read it to the very end with this conclusion. The book was about sex not really much more. I felt as if I was reading a Harlequin Romance with more of sinister plot. The guy is gorgeous, too rich and powerful, the girl naive, yet can handle his abuse for her first time?! Just didn't jive for me. The ending also left me hanging on to the poor confused girl who is supposed to be so smart yet so dumb. One thing you know for sure Mr Grey is used to having his own way, rich and powerful, that he will not be able to have anyone say no to him...I would suspect that is what will take place in the following books. How you can make a trilogy out of this uncomplicated plot? I'll just say...no thanks.
0802130208|5.0|I won't waste time retelling the plot of 'Confederacy' - it's been done in hundreds of other reviews posted here.<br /><br />I just want to say that it is the funniest book I've ever had the good fortune to read.  The characters are priceless, and the story (I don't think there's a plot, per se) is astonishingly original.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend the audio version of this book (read by the masterful Barrett Whitener).  Whitener brings the story to life with his rich blend of accents and characterizations.  He should have one an audio Pulitzer - if there were such a thing - for his work with this book.<br /><br />Final note: I see a few reviewers gave this book one star, and said it wasn't funny at all.  My sympathies to these obviously humor-impaired unfortunates.  Life must be pretty drab for them to have missed this humor in this story.

B00LI7VFGW|5.0|&#34;For a moment, Charlie tried to hold on to the hope that there was another bastard in Elaine's life. She didn't like her father much, for example ... But really, he knew.&#34;<br /><br />Several page later, the reader knows for sure as well. Elaine had often peppered her featured stories on other subjects with amusing complaints about Charlie, his personal habits and his marital failings. But now, after their separation, her editor has loosened whatever restraints there might have been, and given her full range to attack Charlie. And she does, with humor and gusto. Initially Charlie believed it couldn't always be so bad. &#34;He was wrong, of course.&#34;<br /><br />Initially, Charlie was too thrilled with Elaine to notice that her earlier male friends gave signs that Charlie was brave or foolish or naive to be involved with her. In time, her &#34;insatiable appetite for self-exposure and, unavoidably, the exposure of those who happened to be somewhat close to her&#34; soured his enthusiasm. Eventually they both sought a divorce, and for what develops are very different reasons.<br /><br />Hornby has written a very funny, well written account of the disaster that follows. There are moments of gentle humor; Charlie laughs at the idea of &#34;his headmaster father and his church chorister mother giving birth to a child out of wedlock...&#34; At the last moments, he admits to the false name, with remarkable results. One tiny example: Charlie realizes &#34;The word had mutated, and all bastards were men. Girls could be all sorts of horrible, terrible things, but they couldn't be that.&#34;<br /><br />There are moments that are very true to life. Charlie is impressed with a column Elaine writes about her love life, putting her life with Charlie in context. &#34;He'd forgotten that Elaine could actually write. It was painful, though, and raw, and angry, and self-hating.&#34;<br /><br />Hornby could very well be describing his own writing in this fine short story.

B0086DBE62|1.0|I am a big Julia Roberts fan, but Oh My God, what a terrible movie. I cannot believe that I just wasted almost two hours of my life on such nonsense. The adaptation is silly and poorly written. The annoying weird dog-acting of the prince is not funny, well, maybe for kids it is... The Snow White is uninspiring and dull. The queen is bored and boring. The Prince, even though very hot I have to admit, seemed stupid and lost. The only character that was actually fun to watch was Nathan Lane's Brighton. The ending song seemed like creators' desperate, but failed, attempt to add spark to a dull image.  This movie is nothing but a waste of Julia Robert's talent. What a disappointment.

0425263908|4.0|Ah, an actually worthy erotica title to recommend! While it is not perfect, BARED TO YOU blows Fifty Shades of Grey completely out of the water with its put-together writing and incredible protagonist.<br /><br />When Eva Tramell leaves her traumatic past behind her to take a normal job at an ad agency, the last thing she expects is to fall head over heels for Gideon Cross, one of the richest men in the world--and for him to fall for her as well. Their physical connection is instant and intense, but it is what they learn about each other as, slowly, they reveal their pasts and their flaws that draws them together into an unbreakable bond, no matter how difficult things get.<br /><br />Seriously, I'm not exaggerating when I say that Eva Tramell is incredible. Why was the passive, plain, \\"who, me?\\" female protagonist ever in vogue? I say that Eva's independent, forward, and don't-cross-this-line-with-me personality should be the model for future romantic protagonists! The thing that drove me craziest in FSoG was how Ana let Christian walk all over her: \\"Oh, you're a man, you're rich, you're handsome, you're experienced...you obviously know me better than I know myself. Hehe!\\" Gag. No, Eva knows what she wants. She's not afraid to voice her desires, and she'll put her foot down if Gideon does or says anything that gets her riled up. That she does all of this while being a survivor of childhood trauma makes her even more impressive and sympathetic. And she gets jealous and insecure, like everyone else. Wow! Eva should be every man's--and even every woman's--dream. She sure has become mine.<br /><br />On the other hand, rather disturbingly, Gideon Cross is kind of less appealing than Christian Gray. Christian at least is a man, albeit one with a mysterious and troubled past. Gideon, on the other hand, is like a man-child with too much money and time on his hand. \\"Ooh, pretty shiny woman, me want, me want more than anything in my life, gimme!\\" Sexy--uh, yeah, no. I appreciated that Eva was the stronger person in their relationship, instead of letting the troubled Gideon walk all over her (a la Ana Steele). Gideon grew on me by the end--his utter determination to get help for himself in order to make Eva happy and keep her safe definitely threw points in his favor--and besides, without his oftentimes outrageous behavior, there wouldn't be a story, would there?<br /><br />The beginning--up to Eva and Gideon getting together--felt a little forced in terms of the writing, but the sexytimes are hot hot hot, and Sylvia Day has created major and minor characters that you'll find yourself getting attached to before you even realize it. You should read this if you like erotica but felt FSoG was lacking in good writing technique and a compelling character relationship. Because BARED TO YOU delivers on exactly those fronts.iated that Eva was the stronger person in their relationship, instead of letting the troubled Gideon walk all over her (a la Ana Steele).

B007MAETA8|5.0|Without a doubt in my mind I can label this release as John Mayer's best.  The reason one can give that type of acclaim to a stripped down, straight-forward album is the simple fact that its honest.  Mayer is not hiding behind any lyrical cliches and his instrumentation is not being partial to current pop music.  Lyrically, this album is brilliant.  I will not waste time highlighting the album and will simply suggest that one buys this album with minimal speculation into the purchase.  Key tracks:  \\"If I Ever Get Around to Living\\", \\"Love Is A Verb\\" and \\"Something Like Olivia\\"...all the tracks on this album are good.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game has great graphics and I like how you have t o try to unlock all the other games I highly reccomend this game.
B0086700CM|4.0|i love this game a lot its just tht ive been waiting for the app to come out and its not installing! i try it every day and it never works! gosh im sooooo mad :(
B004I2K4DY|5.0|The item arrives on time and in the expected condition. I am very pleased with this purchase! I recommend this dealer.
B005LAIGPA|4.0|I bought this because I didn't get a chance to catch it in theatres. I especially enjoyed the guerrilla film film style it was shot in. That made it seem more like their home movies and what happened to them, than an actual film.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|God is proud of this particular app! tons of features from translations to reading plans. truly a well developed android app.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I don't have HBO, so I pretty much took a gamble on buying this (having never seen it before).  I've only heard great things, so I asked my boyfriend to get it for my birthday on Blu Ray.  It is sooooo amazing!!!  It is definitely the most beautiful television show I have ever seen and has amazing story lines.  It also came with a zillion different special features.  Everyone should buy this...I can't see anyone not liking it!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I cannot believe that Amazon would even offer a book with as dirty and filthy content as this book has.  I read the first copuple of chapters and stopped reading it.  The Playboy magazine looks like Bible compared to this.  If this book represents what is currently a top seller, Then God may have to save the world again!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome and so fun it works best if. you buy a expensive game first bcause then its easier to earn points
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best game in the world in my opinion. I would definitely recommend this game for a kindle fire because of the large screen
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is great you almost never get board with 101 Games +25. If you own this you don't need many other games for your kindle fire but the graphics could be better on the fire.
B0086700CM|5.0|From the first time I played this, I was hooked! So much fun and extremely addicting.... I also get very proud of myself when I beat my high score :) I've never had problems with this game.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Great show, got it for my 5-year old & he was a little traumatized by a baby elephant being eaten, but luckily did not see the Chimp cannibals. I loved it, however.
B0073PZIYI|3.0|Not much of a movie with a lot of wasted talent. I love Cillian Murphy and Justin Timberlake but the story was lacking.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I read 2-3 books each week, and I really didn't expect much from this book. But I love these characters and I laughed and cried right along with them. I couldn't put it down, it's a beautiful story.
1401937268|3.0|After a few months of fussing and fuming about the disingenuous promotions Hay House has used for the new Doreen Virtue Angel Tarot Cards, I am finally holding the deck in my hands. No, I didn't break down and make the purchase. If you are wondering why, see my blog post on the topic.<br /><br />However, I do believe the Doreen Virtue Angel Tarot is a legitimate contribution to the tarot corpus, and I am glad a friend lent me her copy so I could give it a legitimate review.<br /><br />Angel Tarot Cards (yes, that is the official title) looks like a typical Doreen Virtue oracle. It is oversized, printed on very sturdy stock and packaged in a lovely box with a small but substantial booklet. Because of their size and sturdiness, the cards are a bit hard to handle, but lovely to behold.<br /><br />The deck is a standard 78 card tarot deck in many respects. The artwork is gorgeous, but there are few visual clues in each picture about what the card might actually mean. Never fear, there are interpretations written on each card. There is no need to actually intuit or study anything. This is a boon for new tarot readers, or for those who want to use the deck as a simple, easy oracle.<br /><br />I like many of the written interpretations on the cards and in the booklet. Virtue and I agree that every tarot card can have an uplifting meaning. The punctuation on some of the interpretations summons my inner grammar police. The interpretations are a mishmash of full sentences and key words, but each thought is punctuated with a full stop. Apparently angels find no need for complete sentences or proper punctuation. We can't really blame the deck designers for this; many other oracle creators are guilty of the same lazy crime against the English language.<br /><br />The Major Arcana cards are each illustrated with an archangel. The cards bear the traditional number at the top. Each Major Arcana has a name, although many of the names have been changed from the traditional Major Arcana designations. Under the Major Arcana name is the name of the angel, then the illustration. The written interpretations are at the bottom.<br /><br />In this deck, Justice is card eight, and Strength is card eleven.  The Fool has been renamed as \\"The Dreamer.\\" Major Arcana five (Hierophant) is called \\"Unity,\\" twelve (Hanged Man) is called \\"Awakening,\\" thirteen (Death) is \\"Release,\\" fourteen (Temperance) is \\"Balance,\\" fifteen (Devil) is \\"Ego\\", sixteen (Tower) is \\"Life Experience\\" and twenty (Judgment) is \\"Renewal.\\" The rest retain their traditional names.<br /><br />I am comfortable with changing the traditional names of Major Arcana cards. In the five hundred year history of tarot some have already been changed. The Hierophant was once the Pope, for instance. I like Lisa Hunt's replacement of \\"Chains\\" for the Devil, and Eileen Connolly's \\"Transition\\" for Death.<br /><br />I think Virtue's \\"Release\\" for Death is brilliant. I also like \\"Ego\\" for the Devil. I think \\"Life Experience\\" for the Tower is shallow, and \\"Unity\\" for the Hierophant is simply wishful thinking.<br /><br />The assignment of an archangel for each Major Arcana is very interesting, and will be helpful to those who work with archangels, or want to learn more about them. Following in the footsteps of Kris Waldherr and some other modern tarot designers, this is a great example of what I like to call \\"archetypal assignment tarot.\\" The question is, how well do the archangel choices reflect the standard Major Arcana archetypes?<br /><br />The \\"Unity\\" card (Hierophant), is represented by Archangel Sandalphon. Sandalphon is one of the few archangels who was once a mortal man. This makes sense for the \\"Pope\\" archetype of Major Arcana five. The Pope is a mortal man who is also God, or God's representative on Earth. Sandalphon's responsibilities include prayers, personal ascension and Earth. To me, this seems like a very good fit.<br /><br />The High Priestess is represented by Archangel Haniel. Haniel is feminine, and associated with grace, intuitive development, and finding our divine essence. Again, this seems a perfect fit.<br /><br />After studying the archangels and the Major Arcana cards with which they are assigned, I feel the designers of this deck really did their homework. One problem with archetypal assignment decks is the assignments sometimes feel forced. In Angel Tarot Cards, the assignments make sense, and feel natural.<br /><br />My only real complaint with the Major Arcana in this deck is the loss of the \\"Fool's Journey.\\" I would be fine with the \\"Dreamer's Journey.\\" But here, there is no journey at all. Instead, there are simply twenty-two archangels, each with a beautiful picture, a strong archetypal association and a powerful message. For many, this will be enough.<br /><br />For me, the concept of card zero (Fool or Dreamer) as the star of the show and the representation of each of us on our journey through life is critical to developing a full archetypal and allegorical understanding of tarot.<br /><br />The Minor Arcana of Angel Tarot Cards uses the elements instead of the icons. This is not an unusual switch in modern tarot. The Earth cards have green borders and are illustrated with faeries. The Water cards have dark blue borders and are illustrated with mermaids. The Fire cards have dark red borders and are illustrated with dragons. The Air cards have light blue borders and are illustrated with unicorns.<br /><br />The Court of the Minor Arcana is quite traditional, with ranks of Page, Knight, Queen and King. The interpretations include the possibility of the cards representing people, energies or predictions.<br /><br />I have a problem with mixing archangels with unicorns, mermaids, dragons and faeries, especially since Virtue has made a living of presenting the angels as actual beings rather than mythological beings. Does this mean she thinks unicorns and mermaids are actual beings as well? Many people do, but for me this demotes the archangels to mere mythical beasts.<br /><br />Clearly, Angel Tarot Cards would not be my first choice for a personal or professional tarot deck. However, the artwork and deck quality are stunning. The deck honors tarot tradition in many ways, and will be a great tool for folks who want to learn tarot, or who want to learn about the archangels. It is evident that a great deal of work went into producing this deck. That work has resulting in a strong tarot deck that many people will cherish and enjoy. Angel Tarot Cards is a valuable offering to the tarot community, and may serve to bring new tarot enthusiasts into our community.
B004S5C91Q|4.0|Really enjoyed this book and read it within a couple of days, but it was often on my mind when I wasn't reading it! A unique point of view, written from the perspective of a five-year-old who draws you into his world and really makes it (and the inanimate objects within it) come alive for the reader. I would consider this a simple read but one that gets the mind ticking through all the emotions and possibilities that must go through a human captive's mind when they finally reach freedom. In this book, especially for a child who who has never felt rain, touched sand, walked up/down stairs... it really was fascinating to read. Well recommended.
B00821OW8K|2.0|Sorry to give only 2 stars. I sat thru the first hour and was struck by how homogenized and typical the screenplay and acting was. Everything was typical: crab monster aliens, walking alien 'armored' robots, things on the backs of the controlled humans. And lots and lots and lots of 'typical' banter! The alien 'city' over the city looked like a huge oil rig... real creative (sarcasm there.) I couldn't justify spending another $1.99 for the 2nd half of the two hour pilot. I'm not sure I can trust Spielberg as executive producer anymore with his sci-fi influencing (especially after the disappointing War of the Worlds). Not much else to say. I might add I am an avid sci-fi movie lover (since 1957!) and would have expected better for a 'major' series. But for those who enjoy: don't listen to me!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I really don't know what else to say but I love this game like crazy!!!!!!!!!! It is the best game ever!! but be careful when you play a random person because they can turn out to be pervs like the Username Supermannz100. Don't play him!!!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I have this on my iPhone and my Kindle Fire, but cant find it to load it on my Thrive. (insert sad face here)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this series!  Suzanne Collins is a brilliant writer and knows just how to pull her readers in!  I felt like I was a character in the book while I was reading...LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!!
B0042J6VUS|5.0|Incredible price considering where it is shipped from.  We've been really pleased with it.  Couldn't get one for this price at Walmart.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game. good way to kill some time when your board.  Its very time consuming before you know it hour have passed.
B007PAAO0Y|1.0|to be compensated for a life time of quality rythim n blues ...n true soul music...n gospel is no crime,...as one of the premier rnb guitarist n song writers from the 1960s -1990s it is a little disheartening , but truly understandable that he would alingn himself with a group of total incompetant so-called procucers and musicians who obviously have no talent n no understanding of the tradition of soul music.  to be compensated for a lifetime of genious work is no crime,....but again i would definately pass on this product!  its a shame that his talents are being wasted on  a generation of wack producers n musicians,....save ur money ...buy his older music!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it's that there are lots of ads. But in all it's fun and time consuming if you're bored.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has everything that you need including reminders, advice, and bookmarks!! I just love it!! It will keep you on track with our Bible study to - and it's free!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I bout this game on a wim because I wasn't sure if it would be cool but it is totaly awesome.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I honestly thought this movie would be the weakest of the series & i was wrong oh so very wrong (Captain America was). Loved this movie from start to finish & I can't wait for the sequel. You love this review because it was sweet & to the point.
0345803485|5.0|Easy read and Entertaining!  I don't know why people feel the need to compare books to others; it happens a lot more than one may realize.<br />The end of the book makes you wishing you had the second book at your fingertips!
B005UDD1R6|1.0|was completly unable to get this to work wouldn't,t play the video and wouldn't update codex.  what good is a video player that won't play the two most used video formats.
0345803485|5.0|Loved this book! People kept telling me to read it, but I wasn't sure about it. I finally did and it was awesome. I love the story line and my husband is enjoying me reading it too. I have never read any book about sex before.
0440419514|5.0|I love these books and I got them in perfect condition. These are a must-read for children,teens or young adults!
B00571F26Y|5.0|I downloaded this book as for many years suspected that Wheat did not agree with my body. Once I started reading<br />was astonished at how little we really know about what we are putting in our mouths. After reading only the<br />first chapter decided to cut wheat out of my diet. I have lost 6 kilos easily and feel totally energized.<br />I used to feel tired all the time, with plenty of aches in my bones etc. My skin and hair look so much better<br />and I think I am even looking younger!! I highly recommend this book to anyone especially if you think wheat does<br />not agree with you.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app. It is very accurate, I check it several times a day and it hasn't disappointed me yet. (
0307951529|5.0|Great ideas and a perfect way to get motivated with ideas and ways to start your own business. If at least one of these doesn't bring you ideas don't bother starting a business in the first place.
B007SGM084|5.0|fun light read to escape from all the stress. If looking for a serious read this is not the book for you.
0446572993|5.0|Baldacci is one of those writers who has been slowly slippng from his first masterpieces. Some of his later novels have been simply disapointing, maybe because I expected so much from him. And then comes \\"The Innocent\\"... Looks like Baldacci is back: Original, fast-paced, plausible and with complex characters. I could not put it down. A great thriller.
B004SIPA4G|5.0|If you're into comics at all you'll love this movie. You won't be disappointed for sure. I'm not sure how to recommend it to others but you certainly don't need to be a comics fan to enjoy it. I absolutely loved it without reservation.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. The graphics were really cool and the story line was great.  I really enjoy playing games like this.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|No need to have a long review on this.<br /><br />If you liked one of the movies like Ironman or Hulk then you will definitely enjoy this one as well.<br /><br />Great visuals for your eyes and a funny and entertaining story will let you enjoy this movie for sure.<br /><br />Relax, enjoy and have fun!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I have never read a Nicholas Sparks novel before,but I must say after reading this one I will be purchasing many more.Really enjoyed it,heartwarming and well written.Can't wait to read the next one<br /><br />A new fan
B0041KKYBA|1.0|After all I just could not watch this dvd. Not even once. It was impossible to extract it from the box with a crack. Do not want a replacement: taxes in my country will triple the price. Paying for that twice is not very smart. The experience was useful to learn that some american products are *not* to be bought. The complaint I filed was never answered.<br />The movie is fantastic the product is crap.
0385360169|3.0|I got all three at once thanks to a colleague atnwork. I started the first one and could not put it down. The book is very well written and draws you in immediately.<br />Well done.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is probably the best on the kindle besides modern combat 3 id only give more powerups because that the only thing thats stinks
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Hours of fun the whole family can get in on. My seven year old loves it and is still interested in this app., two months later.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|After many months of researching survival knives I decided to go with the BK2 I am glad I did. There are better knives out there but not at this price point and let's be honest with some knives hitting over $400 dollars $60 is a great price.<br />The knife is well balanced hunk of steel!! Perfect for serious use and will stand up to serious abuse. The only negative is the sheath. It is a kydex sheath and fits the knife well but is horrible when it comes to attaching to things (belt). The good thing is you can find great sheaths on eBay or other places on the net.<br />To end, it's a great knife specially for survivalist and a great price.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|A little repetitive on the sex side but I liked the underlying story and found it hard to put down. I thought it was a nice easy romantic story.
0345803485|5.0|This book can seriously alter your sex life for the better! I enjoyed every minute of it, it really captures you and consumes you. Buying one book is not enough, get them all! They just keep getting better and better. AMAZING! I love these books!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I just downloaded this, so I am on my<br />first run through of the various games but so far they are easy to learn and fun - major requirements for a Labor Day roadtrip with our grandson. 1950's car games will only work so long for a 21st century kid - we can exchange wind turbines for windmills but not all States require front and back car license plates so it is much harder to find all 50 states and count multiples. Will be great for in car. rest periods and winding down at night.
B003O86FMW|3.0|its an awsome book same with the other two but in the book katniss gets into big problems that includes her loved ones. when the capitol threatens her you're like Â«hey can't you just kill her and get over itÂ» but no then i understood why.  i didnt really enjoyed it when they put katniss back into  to the games and destroyed district 12 but there are some parts i do like. i feel bad for katniss all the trouble she's been through just to keep her loved ones safe and sound...........:(
1419337319|4.0|This is a book I thought I should read, but did not particularly expect to enjoy.  And many of its elements are not what I generally look for in a novel: almost entirely unsympathetic characters, an extremely slowly-paced story and an almost nonsensical plot, a worldview with which I profoundly disagree in some important respects.  None of those things by itself necessarily makes for a bad novel, but all of them together?  By all rights, I should have hated this book!  And yet...I didn't.  There is something about Camus's use of language, the structure of the story, that pulls you in almost against your will.  I found myself deeply absorbed in this strange character and his stranger life, unlikable as he may have been.  And at the end, I found myself satisfied with the conclusion.  On reflection, from a certain standpoint, Mersault's final change in his fundamental outlook on life and attitude toward existence doesn't seem to make much sense...but as you're reading it, in the context of the novel, it makes for a powerful esthetic experience.  If this review seems a bit inconsistent, it's because I really can't explain my reaction to this novel.  All I can say is, I liked it, even if I don't know exactly why.  Maybe that isn't entirely helpful, but who knows? even if you think you won't, give it a try and you might like it, too.
B00006C7G9|5.0|This series is absolutely AMAZING! We sat down and watched all 6 tapes over the weekend and it was wonderful! A great war series. Special effects and actors were all amazing.
B004QL7K6G|2.0|The first half of the film surprisingly had some creative novel funnies and not the usual spiel that has been pulled out of the writer's file cabinet where it is filed as \\"been done & said untold times before\\" for the sucker born every minute. But the last half of the movie just dragged with a predictable and repetitive storyline. Another example of writers not having enough creative range to fill out and then finish their script.<br /><br />Movies about a return to hippie, commune, peace & love living emerge from either LA or NY writers about every five years so we were due for this rendition. This one had mostly an east coast vibe largely because of the quirky \\"dumb blonde\\" hook filled as usual by Aniston although, admittedly, she performed the role quite well. Now that I think about it, I'm not sure if that's a compliment or not. Subplot and foil to the quirky blonde was the usual income & status driven male love interest as counterpoint to her now stereotypic quirk portrayals. The hIppies, of course, win the day against the evil developers & bankers, in showing that veggies rule over bank accounts and portfolios. Well, until push comes to shove.<br /><br />Restricted Rating Warning:<br />It's surprising how rarely full nudity is found in film given it's inherently curious we are about the subject. Must be effective lobbying from Christian/Islamic/Hebrew doctrine keepers to hide such evil from the public. Church knows best, and their resources/influences run deep. No models - just the body next door. Adding fuel to the fire are drugs and obnoxious, self-interested behavior (greed).
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't not put this book down.  In fact, I devoured the entire series.  You would assume you'd read the book for the \\"special scenes\\" which makes you belly tighten, but you really get into the characters and the story of their journey.  Some would say the whole S&M is wrong and therefore makes this book undesirable.  I'd say they are missing the point of the series and if this series doesn't call to your female psyche ---- you're not being honest with yourself.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|A must read! Guaranteed not to be sorry you bought and read this one! You will not be able to put it down!
1439127700|1.0|This review pertains to to the Kindle edition. Someone's highlights or notations are set on the Kindle edition and they cannot be turned off! Therefore, on any page where there's a quotation (that has an associated notation), it's nearly impossible to click the next or back page without going to the notations section. This means that you lose your place in the book. Annoying! The book itself was average, maybe a little above average. But it's lacking in first person resources - you can tell that the author sat in the presidential libraries and got their sources from there. No (or very little) quotes exist from the principles or others who worked for the Presidents in looking back on those times. Overall, DO NOT BUY THE KINDLE EDITION. I am going to try to get my money back.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|I was more than LIVID when I got this for my kids since one of our favorite games on my phone-&quot;Alchemy Fusion&quot;- isn't available. To my horror my 10yr old brings it to me &amp; says,&quot;Mommy,is this inappropriate? &quot;-yes my kids know that word-...I look at it &amp; see a picture of a man straddling a woman,or it might have been vice-versa,I was so mortified I closed it quickly. But I did find out that when you put humans together you get that image with the word &quot;sex&quot; under it. Put a freaking warning on this filth you idiot app maker! I read the reviews and looked at the pics if I would have seen anything that seemed off I never would have let them play. you people suck!!!!!
B0081L37Z0|5.0|This movie was such a pleasant surprise.  They took all the stereotypical set ups for jokes, and completely turned them inside out.  Really liked this movie.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this is awesome and if ur child wants to buy something put a parent lock on it this is the best
B00821P6OY|5.0|I wanted to see last season's final episode to prepare for the new season.  I truly love the show.  The quality was very good.
B006GHA9QQ|1.0|What's good: The sets and costume design make this DVD worth watching. There were 3 good original tunes. There were reprises of some melodies/spoken lines from the original Phantom. The kid who played Gustave had a great singing voice. One of the swimmers had great legs.<br /><br />What's bad (really, really bad):<br />The lyrics were so horrible they sound like a first-grader writing a nursery rhyme. The \\"new\\" melodies are a rip off of other musicals. I thought I was listening to excerpts from Sunset Boulevard, Miss Saigon, and Evita! And it's like I was watching a Cirque du Soleil/Gypsy/original Phantom/daytime soap opera (Who's your daddy?) mash-up.The story was so inconsistent with the original Phantom (i.e., Christine is upset that the Phantom left her after they slept together? Hello!?! She was date raped, and he was playing his organ (no pun intended) in the next room when she was waking up. He never left her alone.) Characters! Besides lack of development, why did Meg look like Annie Potts? Why does Madame Giry look like Patti LuPone? Why does Christine look so Irish? And why does everyone have a fake English accent, but they're all supposed to be French? Don't even get me started on the ending!<br /><br />Watch at your own risk. But enjoy the campiness!
B007BZM3HK|1.0|Annoying, Autotune, Awful sums up this song nicely.  It is not even worthy of a silly summer track.  It has absolute no redeeming factor.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I've had this app since December, and it has worked perfectly the whole time. Never has it slowed down my Kindle Fire, nor interfered with my youTube access. I use it frequently, and have downloaded over 50 songs with this app. I would, and have, recconmend this to my friends and family.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|not like old school game but its cool, I guess! I wish I could find the old school one though!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was surprised that this book was rated so highly.<br />It was pure nasty, and I, for one, did not like all that perverted sex.<br />Not my cup of tea at all.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have an ipad with the kindle app and I LOVE IT! I bought and downloaded the 50 shades of Grey trilogy and within minutes I was reading. The trilogy is great for a summer read. Its nothing life altering, just another inciting romance novel. It might spring up conversations about women's sexual desires, but nothing that hasnt been discussed before. If you want a good, sexy summer read-check it out
B007PTJOV0|4.0|a fun game for kids not hard love it!<br />love!love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love love
B0086700CM|5.0|there really isn't anything to say about the game its just fun and addictive and FREE. so you get it now
B0086700CM|5.0|this game I cannot stop playing never gets old it seems fab game in whole app store u should buy this game. if u like an adventurous game where u have to run threw a bridge in the jungle while monkeys are chasing u this is your game get it for FREE
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The third book felt just like a regular love story.  Good, fun to read, but not compelling.  The author did a good job of tying up all loose ends.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|This is a unique and challenging game (at least to me). The easy levels offer a nice introduction to this genre possibly hooking a few folks. It would be nice to have a hint function though
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game my bff almost beat my high score so I played all night. anyways fun game. :p
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Amazing app....totally addicting. I can't even begin to express how much I love this app. It's a *must have*!!!! The tutorial is a little confusing, but not horribly so. I had never played any nonogram games prior to this one...it ROCKS!!!!!
B0025KVLU6|5.0|This is one of the greatest records of all time and the packaging was a part of the power of it.  Some dimwit stuck a BEATLES logo on the edge.  Marketing in its most insidious form.  It makes me want to puke.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|An excellent modern day adaptation of the classic Holmes character. Benedict Cumberbatch is perfect as Holmes. It has some great interpretations of familiar classics such as \\"The Hounds of the Baskervilles\\".
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love these games. I just wish it was easier to get more games free. also after reviewing non of the games have instructions. if they do they arr hard to find.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|This was the first book I bought for my touch Kindle. It is very well written and the insights into the Presidents' Club were amazing. It was all news to me how the presidents from both sides of politics were so supportive to each other and how they worked together. It was a very different atmosphere from the election campaigns. A very good read.
B006VC3LES|5.0|In short the Best Movie ever made.  A viewer could watch \\"Chinatown\\" forever and ever and not get bored.  The performances are scintillating.  The writing begot more memorable lines than any other picture ever made.  This is Jack Nicholson at his finest peak.  If one could freeze Jack at this point in his life and career, one would have a perpetual national treasure.  If a viewer could only see one movie for the rest of one's life, it would have to be Chinatown.  I recommend collecting as many copies of this movie in whatever formats, packaging, editions, \\"special collection editions,\\" etc.  This is detective noir at its zenith.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|I have enjoyed this game. wish it had a little more of a storyline behind it though. but not bad for the free app of the day
0439023513|5.0|Today I know a new truth about my ability to write anything of value. Finally I understand that I write best in survival mode, when I must and about subjects of such great importance to me personally that the need to write becomes an emotional thorn if unmet!<br /><br />I now write about Suzanne Collins' book trilogy, THE HUNGER GAMES. Far from the surface of \\"real\\" and deep within the bowels of contemplation, I cannot escape its implications of dreadful danger to future generations and indeed, to us also.<br /><br />Hidden in the crevices and folds of fantastic science fiction technology, Ms. Collins has locked large, ugly grains of possibility; hinged perhaps un-be-known to her on an absence in the lives of her characters.<br /><br />The finality of her trilogy leaves me breathless in its stark truths and implied hopelessness for humanity. Her suggestion that we are doomed to never learn from our own history beyond a few generations, is reminiscent of how I imagine hell. Thus Ms. Collins's readers face a terrifying conclusion that without altruistic love we are doomed to replicate desperate, self-serving, cruel patterns, sliding helplessly into an unknown yet entirely feasible dark and hopeless future.<br /><br />Yet, just as this conclusion seems likely, Katniss's love for her sister eventually propels her into an ever present and compelling need to protect the innocent, and shines forth in a blaze of glory. Katniss's courageous spirit and her uncanny, unpredictable ability to maintain hope at-all-costs provides Ms. Collins' trilogy with a satisfying, surreal, thought provoking conclusion to this arm-chair adventure.<br /><br />One oversight for me, however, is the author's failure to give her readers a last glimpse of the mockingjay and to possibilities of how its song might impact future generations. I would have enjoyed an ending that included mockingjay songs. Yet even now I linger, rereading her concluding chapter, reflecting on the hope therein for I am notyet ready to tell Katniss Everdeen good bye.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|this is the best game ive ever played in my life anyone out there who's looking at this app don't just sit there and think about it get it now its the bomb!
B00005R24K|5.0|Classic great movie! This is my favorite Evil Dead movie, it doesn't provide as much humor, which is fine. It fits more into the horror genre, and is a classic 80's horror flick. Not cheesey, very well thought out plot. Highly recommended!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I got this book because there were so many good reviews on it. I didn't care for it too much. I kept reading, hoping it would get better, but it never really did.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|not the best game I've ever played... but not bad. its story is kinda lame but the game is still enjoyable.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|My entire family has down loaded this game and we have been playing back and forth for the last month. This is a simple, fun, and very entertaining product! On a couple of occasions my son's have called and prodded me to respond back so we can go to the next round! Great Fun!
B0050DIWFC|2.0|Suspenseful but is a depressing book.  Yes - it holds your attention because you keep thinking SURELY the story has something uplifting in it.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|A cleverly written book. Suspenseful...I couldn't put it down! I read this book in three days. The illustrations were dark and fascinating  (in the words of my 11 yr old daughter)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a good game because u play a lot of FUN games. only problem is that there is a lot of ads
B0086700CM|5.0|Awesome game. Very addictive. A nice way to spend some time waiting on transit or just for fun. I would highly recommend this game to anyone that wants something fun but challenging.
B0086700CM|4.0|It is fun at first but then it gets a little boring. If you like upgrades then get this game.It is very fun.
B005F8CL1S|5.0|Purchased new for a paltry $38 from Amazon Marketplace seller, zoverstocks, this collection defines value.<br /><br />Previously, if someone had asked me the best way to become familiar with Leonard Cohen's work, I would have recommended the Essential Collection.  But now, for less than $3.50 per album, one would be a fool to purchase anything else.  With greater sonic detail and tighter bass, all the while largely preserving the original dynamic range, this collection offers the best-sounding digital versions of these amazing albums available today.<br /><br />For those who care about such things (me being one of them), here are the dynamic range values of the 11 included albums:<br /><br />foobar2000 1.1.11 / Dynamic Range Meter 1.1.1<br

B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I have seen The Phantom of the Opera many, many, many times.  But no Phantom has really made me cry.  Until Ramin Karimloo.<br />This production is a fantastic one.  The cast is superb.  Unlike Les Miserables' 25th Anniversary Concert, this production is a full performance, and there is not a weak link in the cast.<br />Ramin Karimloo's Phantom is vocally excellent but packs a lot of emotional punch as well.  Sierra Boggess is lovely as Christine.  And Hadley Fraser's Raoul is noble and handsome -- with a beautiful voice that goes with the beautiful appearance.<br />The updated set and costume are breathtakingly beautiful.  And for a \\"filmed\\" version of a stage version, my, the camerawork is excellent as well.<br />I knew there would be a \\"bonus\\" at the very end, and, man, it sure did not disappoint.  First, Andrew Lloyd Webber himself appears on stage.  And then the entire original London company.  Then, Michael Crawford!  And, of course, Sarah Brightman!<br />And she sings!  But wait, there's more!  Instead of Michael Crawford, who couldn't sing because he'd just arrived after a matinee performance of a show on WE, Peter Jöback, Colm Wilkinson (!), John Owen-Jones (!!), and Anthony Warlow (!!!) appear as Phantom, AND THEY ALL SING!<br />This one's a keeper.  I know I'll enjoy it for many, many years to come.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is awesome.  There is so many different options and games to play with.  I love getting to earn coin and buying games with those coins to play even more.
B005LAIIS0|5.0|BOUGHT THIS ITEM FOR MY NEPHEW AS A GIFT AND HE LOVES IT!  GOOD MOVIE! HE HAS WATCHED THREE TIMES IN ONE WEEK.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I like that you can. hangs he number of pieces. There are so many categories of puzzles!  Its also great that I can just have the edges and not all the pieces at he start of the puzzle.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|awesome good quality and It is really helpful. neat. quick easy and kind of fun to use. thanks for inventing this.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. i am addicted I cant wait to play vitally the time... my sister will finally have her I pad now cause I don't need it
B007PTJOV0|5.0|you should really. really buy it. it's like Mario and in my opinion it is one of the best games ever!!
B003KGBISY|5.0|you know what it is... amazing movie.. criterion is great as always... a little pricey but thats to be expected
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game and it is a fair game.  You must get this game from Amazon...  Just download it and enjoy....
B001AQO3QA|3.0|This review is for the Alien Anthology 6-disc Blu-ray set.<br />While the picture and sound are fantastically reproduced, and improved upon,there is one nagging issue I have.<br />During playback, the MUTHAR Mode 'progress bar' pops up randomly several times during the movie.  It is highly distracting, and have thus far been unsuccessful turning it off.<br />Blu-ray player is a Toshiba BDX1100.
B000JQUMPI|4.0|I have fond memories of reading this book repeatedly many years ago and it's great to have a Kindle copy now. Times and manners may have changed since the more gentile era of this book, but there is still a lot that resonates here, all the way to the present day.
1609611543|5.0|This is an excellent book that finally explains  the root causes of sickness and weight gain. My husband and I have been researching diet and nutrition for the past 10 years and have known insulin response is the key to all. One problem that I do see with this book is the mention that calories are not important. My husband and I are both 60 and we do see that calories do matter.  My husband is a personnel trainer and is in the gym 5 days a week and I am not so our calorie intake is different. You have to find out what works for you! This book is a must read for anyone who is struggling to keep the weight off!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|please fix energy time!! it ruins the game to run out of energy so quickly!! we already have to wait for crops and food it would be nice to take care of it without energy limitations. will five star with an update
B001O9BB3G|5.0|Movie's donot give you the entire story as the book gives you. The plot takes back you 1950's and gives you an aura of how the time look liked then. The intricate details describe how a two womens's love gives you courage to overcome during dire times.Kudos to shamim sharif for another wonderful book.
0761169253|5.0|If I had to put it in a nutshell, I'd say this book is a great reminder of important things creative people should never forget. It's easy and fun to read, inspiring, and it has a very handy pocket size too.
0553582038|2.0|I read Storm of Swords and was excited to get my teeth into The Feast for Crows. This book didn't address any of the cliffhanger in Swords, didn't speak from the point of view of Tyrion, Jon or Daenerys, and dragged on in descriptive prose for pages without any human dialogue. I found myself skipping through just to find something of substance. He introduces a lot of knew characters briefly but none that could hold my attention for very long.  Jamie's sarcasm is the only thing that kept me reading for as long as I did but at 60% I think I'm going to call it quits. I can't help but wonder how this will play out on the HBO series. I'll read the reviews on book 5 before I make the committment. Such a disappointment!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I use this game for long car rides a bored evenings. I expected it to be pretty cheap since it was a free game but it actually is not that bad.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|so fun!! just like Mario kills a lot of extra time. I think its a great idea to have this take because it brings back good memories!!
B003Y5USF0|5.0|I've loved this film since the first time I saw it, and it's a fun getaway movie for us. A little conflict, a little romance, a little thriller, nice special effects, good supporting characters. And tornadoes! What more could you want?
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was one of those books that you can't put down. It's twists and turns keep you guessing until the end
B00308SOA2|5.0|Sadly, Nora Ephron is now lost to us.  This, along with When Harry Met Sally, are among some of her best efforts.  Her movies, themes, cast of characters, story lines, etc. are all memorable and very special spirit lifters.  With a cast like Tucci and Streep how could anybody go wrong?! They are both so pleasurable to watch.<br /><br />I felt compelled to watch Julie and Julia over and over again. This movie is better than an upper; it simply transports you to a happier place and time; the second disk allows you to see Julia herself in action as she was on tv!  Unfortunately, I missed Julia when she was alive and on the first home tv cooking show but now I can enjoy her whenever I'd like. I am not a fan a French food (I'm an Asian foodie) but she provided me, an experienced cook, with some good new ideas for making food better.<br /><br />If your mood needs a pick-up, watch and enjoy this utterly delightful double disk.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I know my review is just going to get lost in the thousand others but the author asked so here is my two cents:<br /><br />I agree with the reviews that this might be widely considered a classic one day. I'm not an expert in fiction but in my opinion the writing is excellent, the story moves, and the tension is great. I wasn't high on the last couple events / ending because I thought it was a bit too foreseeable and the unexpected is what makes the work so good. I'm not sure what I would have done differently but, as a fan, I get to criticize the objects of my fanaticism on things they do way better than I ever could. Overall, I loved it though and I have absolutely no reservations recommending this to everyone.
B004HXIZVC|4.0|It is amazing but if you didn't already know the kindle doesn't have a microphone you can buy one starting at 3 dollars, other than that it is a good app.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|The Splashtop Remote Desktop is easy to set up, works as it is presented, and makes connecting to my home computer very easy.
B0086700CM|5.0|no better game. flat this is the best game ive played on kindle and every other mobile device flat.......................... yep.
B007SGM084|5.0|Great read! Might just improve my sex life with my husband. I would recommend these to anyone who reads as a hobby.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|first of all, you might want to keep it on kids safe mode on...second of all its stupid but very addictive!!!
B0063GORYU|4.0|pretty dadgum hard on 4suits...  not all that easy on two suits... deals seem to be purposely difficult rather than random
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to use and love that you can access KJV and other translations.  I also live that you can lay in bed and read the Bible in the dark.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|this book is the last of the 3 hunger games series....its as good as the last two. just can't wait to see how it all ends....who will katniss choose?
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I think that it is a VERY great and fun game. I play it all the time. It is great. The only problem is that it give tons of the same words.:( It also used to say that I was playing on multiple devices and my pictures wouldn't send. But after uninstalling it and installing it again it takes away that problem. Overall fun game.
B000063JZQ|4.0|The Polanski version is an excellent rendition of the play, Macbeth. It is rated R for violence and nudity. However, it is faithful to Shakespeare's tragedy and keeps the audience focused on the events as they unfold quickly and tragically for the Macbeths.
B000000XB8|5.0|This is a quality remaster LP that any CCR fan should own. Other than the occasional crackle and pop heard on four or five tracks which I suspect should wear off upon repeated plays, the pause between the songs are silent. Surface noise is non-existent and the sound reproduction from this heavy double LP is quite dynamic.<br /><br />Informative liner notes donned both sides of the double leaf cover chronicling their hits achievements, which is a nice touch. The only gripe is that the inner sleeve is made of paper. Well, for such a reasonable price, something has got to give, I guess.<br /><br />Compared to the remastered CD box-set that I also own, the sound reproduction from these LPs are superior. Drums beat deeper, bass plunge lower and the high hats simply sound more substantial on the vinyl. These rocking tunes are meant to be appreciated on vinyl!
B0028R3NCU|1.0|same problem as other reviewers.  one or two uses, and now it no longer works with any of my sd cards.  i've even been carrying it in a little rubber case on my keys, not using the the reader itself as a keychain.  i've had it a month.  it doesn't even look used.  i've owned similarly designed readers (out of production now, it seems..) which lasted for YEARS.  don't waste your money on this garbage.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I love hidden object games and found many to be poor but this one kept me going and its one of the best out there.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|There was lots of gossip regarding this book which raised my curiosity. On completion I thought long & hard about it and referred it to my spouse to read as in my mind it fell into the class of a literary 'chick flick'. It may be some time before she passes comment as she is engrossed in another book at the moment. I don't think it was all that well written and even became frustrated with the repetitive descriptions of eye movements and facial expressions among other boring sexual descriptions. Story line is still a chick flick but I wouldn't not read the sequals if I was short of something better to read.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Wow, just WOW. Once in a while, a book comes along right when you need it. For me, Slammed was this type of book. I took away many important messages, ones that I needed to be reminded of lately and that can only enhance my life and make me a better mother and person. For that alone, I say \\"thank you\\" to Colleen Hoover.<br /><br />The story took me somewhat by surprise as I wasn't quite sure what to expect. I didn't want to read too many reviews once I started to hear about this book, mainly because it is so highly rated and I didn't want to read any accidental spoilers. I wasn't prepared to be so touched by the characters, the journeys they take, and the challenges presented to them. I absolutely love all the people in this book, and Hoover does an AMAZING job making you feel like you know them without being long-winded and going into excruciating detail. Everything just flows and the book is an amazingly quick read with simple yet complex messages.<br /><br />This book is full of contradictions...it's happy, it's sad...it's funny, it's serious...it's elation, it's devastion...it's everything a book should be. Do yourself a favor and read it. You will laugh, you'll cry, and you'll learn a lot of important life lessons. In case you can't tell, I absolutely loved this book and Colleen Hoover, you are amazing! Thank you for opening my eyes and for introducing me to slam poetry, The Avett Brothers, and Marty Schoenleber.
0783225903|5.0|Basically, it's an alternate universe depiction of a very dirty industrialized world, much like our own, in which an insurance adjuster fantasizes of freeing himself from the bureaucracy and running away with the woman of his dreams. I'm not going to get into a synopsis, I'll list my reasons for liking this movie and hopefully help you determine if this is a film you'd mind spending 2 hours of your life with.<br /><br />If you like old school science fiction where you have gadgets and machines turned inside out letting you see how they operate, see this film.<br /><br />If you like cyberpunk films like Blade Runner, Terminator, Alien, Ghost in the Shell, etc., you'll like the look of this film a lot.<br /><br />If you like satire, really, really funny satire and top notch acting you'll like this film.<br /><br />If you like films that keep you guessing and leave you with something to think about you'll like this film.<br /><br />And if you like a consistent theme and not a different song every scene, this film's title song, Brazil, will stay with you long after you're done seeing this film.<br /><br />Brazil came out in 2 versions: the \\"LOVE CONQUERS ALL\\" cut and the director's cut--the director's cut is the way to go but the film is so good that you'll probably want to see the happy version back to back just to give yourself some variety if you decide to pop it in again. Hope this review helped.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I feel the game is fun and entertaining to any kids mind and I would reccomend it to any parent with a child who likes ice age
B007J4T2G8|1.0|How is this a best seller??? I have to believe that teens are driving the sales of this book because I cannot imagine any grown woman relating to the silly, lip-biting, dim-witted, rather inarticulate (for a lit major, no less!), mess that is the female protagonist.<br /><br />Please, save your money and in doing so cast your vote for a brighter future.
B0063IH60K|5.0|it very addicting I love it you should totally get the only thing I has about it is that it has helps or hints
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a good solid app with no obvious bugs, the interface is nice and clean with an uncluttered design.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love it it is soooo fun I love it movie theater shows movies and everything I think all ages would like it
B0086700CM|5.0|like most of America,  I love this app/game! all you do is run through a temple collecting coins but for some reason its fun... once you play irlt you'll never wanna stop
B00008G9JO|5.0|In Heavy Horses, Ian Anderson and other members of Jethro Tull make as solid a rock'n roll connection between the basic elements of life itself and Truth as I've ever heard.  \\"Weathercock,\\" \\"Acres Wild,\\" and \\"Moths\\" alone are enough to make the album a stand-out, while the title cut's philosophic weight is the anchor for other frames of life the band serves up.  But beware before you enter.  Ian says it himself:  \\"[He]'ll Sing You No Lullaby.
B00628RVV0|5.0|This movie was great. The story was amazing, characters were good, actors even better, and great filmwork. Definitely rent/buy this.
B0012YYZYK|5.0|I just received this on blu ray and thought I'd write a brief description about it.<br /><br />There were no audio problems, either in Dolby 5.1 or dts hd, throughout the movie. However, I noticed that the extra songs (misty mountain hop, over the hills and far away, etc) sounded flat and tinny. On the led zeppelin DVD (2003), these performances had not only better sound but better visual effects and editing.<br /><br />The picture, however, looks great; hard to believe this was filmed almost 40 years ago.<br /><br />There are a few extras, 3 or 4 songs that were previously left out, as well as an interview. Standard blu ray case.<br /><br />The movie itself is pretty enjoyable, if you like led zeppelin; the movie is half concert footage and half... well... movie. I won't go into this since I'm sure others have written about the movie itself in great detail.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Very fun and entertaining. Challenging as game goes on. recommend to anyone.Try it. Try it. Try it. Try it. Really
1609611543|5.0|I read 60+ books per year on exercise, nutrition and health, and this book is the best nutrition book I've read since Good Calories, Bad Calories.  This book provides a much deeper understanding of how wheat may be behind many of the weight, skin, energy, other health issues you may be having.  I've been experimenting with my own body and with my employees, family and some of our members and it looks like Dr. Davis is right.<br /><br />This is a great read.  Very informative and practical, and actually a bit of fun.
014241543X|3.0|Gayle Forman's If I Stay came to me preceded by a lot of hype. \\"Breathtaking\\" was a word often used to describe this book, and my daughter has read it more than once. In fact, it took up residency in her school locker this year, where she kept it when it wasn't being loaned out to friends.<br /><br />The story is about Mia, a high school senior who's extraordinarily gifted at the cello. Her family, a preternaturally hip and cool foursome, is made up of a musician-turned-teacher father, a liberal mom, and a much younger and precocious brother. Her older boyfriend is an up-and-coming rock star. Of course, Mia's perfect life is interrupted by a freak car accident, and the \\"If I stay\\" of the title is that she's caught between life and death, left with the decision to stay or go.<br /><br />My feelings about the book may have been colored by too much hype, but after reading it, I simply found it \\"too-too.\\" Mia's life was too perfect (and apparently, she only applied to one top music school: Juilliard. Never mind any other music school). There are plot holes galore after the accident. And my daughter, an elementary cellist, has been rageball since she first read the book that a gifted cellist such as Mia would have listed the cello strings out of order: something that bothered me as well, and I have no knowledge past Suzuki Cello School Book 1. Everything was too obvious and too over-the-top at its attempts to pull at heartstrings. While it may appeal to the hormones of teens and tweens, I found the concept to be intriguing, but the execution to be mostly cardboard cutout. The cover of my daughter's copy reads: \\"Will appeal to fans of Stephenie Meyer's Twilight.\\" I'd say they were on the money with that observation.<br /><br />This review appeared previously on Goodreads.
B0086700CM|1.0|this app is so incredibly disappointing/defective on HTC EVO why does Apple get all the good stuff that works well.... does Android users not deserve the same quality apps?
B00008PX8P|5.0|This DVD set includes an array of recorded shows and interviews that should be in every collection of every led zeppelin fan: from the raw synergy of the gladsaxe teen club performance in '69, to their final blast in knebworth 10 years later.<br />The box itself is nice, housing the two discs like a book (I expected a typical DVD case), and contains a small booklet with several descriptions and pictures for each disc.<br />If you like led zeppelin you should get this--period. If you're trying to decide between this or some other led zeppelin movie/video collection, this is a no-brainer.<br /><br />My thoughts on this box set:<br />-The editing for the MSG shows, both in visual effects and audio, are better than in The Song Remains the Same movie. The less tinny sound makes up for the lack of hd.<br />-The half hour show in gladsaxe teen club is incredible, albeit lacking in the energy zep had later on like during the royal Albert hall.
B004R1VXYU|5.0|I had never heard of this band.  I found this through Amazon's \\"Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought\\" link and I am so glad I did!  I love almost every song on the album.  I would love to see these guys live!
B007P3TMW2|5.0|This is a very touching movie that deals with some heavy subjects such as a child trying to make sense of his father's death in the World Trade Center tragedy, Asperger's, the traumatic effect on the family, and healing.  It is wonderfully acted with a solid story line.  There was not a dry eye in the living room at the conclusion.  I will definitely be watching this again.
1608871045|5.0|got this book yesterday and if you are a die-hard Batman fan like myself you will love it! One of the best Batman books out there a must own for Batman fans
159420229X|4.0|An entertaining book about Josh Foer's discovery of the memorizing nerd world and his quest to become the US champion. A few tidbits:<br /><br />A short lesson about the loci method of memorization (this book does not directly teach memory techniques)<br />Memory history (a walk down memory lane)<br />Josh's journey as a memory competitor<br />Memory freaks: A Russian journalist who retained every word he ever heard, Rain Man, a 'savant' fraud and two men with almost no memory at all<br /><br />This is an interesting and worthwhile read about Josh's discovery of the nerd world of memorization.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this app because you get a variety of games at your disposal. it's not so difficult to get the points that you need to unlock a game. I'd say for a free app,  this one is pretty generous. just ignore the ads, you 'll never see an ad -less free application out there anyway.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book is AMAZING. Tells you exactly what to do to become what the title says. It teaches you how to manipulate you diet and exercise to be what you want- more size, more lean, or both. Rock solid, safe, and healthy advice. I am a medical doctor and I just love this book.  I have been following the diet advise and am working with heavier weights since reading this book 2 weeks ago. I have not changed my workout routine yet. I see results already. My shirts are tighter around my chest, back and arms. I see results from each work out now. Weight is up but my waist is the same.  No kidding! I was eating healthy but was not eating enough, specifically not enough carbs and the timing wasn't quite right. Thanks Mike! In a few weeks I am going to start your weight routine and will update my review.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is a great app.  easy to use easy to see numbers and keys<br />would recommend for anyone liking yo use a calculator
B004SBS8LA|3.0|it only shows add free version on kindle fire for 99 &cent; so u cant get add supported version for free.<br /><br />other wise a great game really fun
B007WULJ5G|5.0|When I heard about this movie through a friend, because It was hardcore I was intrigued, I feel drawn to over the top controversial movies, specially the foreign kind, however this is not a movie I would personally buy to DVD, or watch again not because it was a bad film, it was not. I think the actors did a great job, I think the director did a good job, but the nature of this movie is obscene for me, I have seen many other movies that are really sick and disturbing, but @ the end of the day after I've watched it is just another movie for me. With a Serbian Movie, I felt wrong, the movie does bring a lot of underground taboo subject matter, and things that will possibly make the viewer question their morals. The movie is not bad is not boring, it has good acting, and a interesting plot. But this is not a feel good movie in addition this is a movie that makes the viewer feel guilty for watching it.
0307352145|5.0|As the wife of an introvert, I have seen employers and acquaintances unfairly criticize my husband for personal qualities that had to do with his being an introvert. Many times extroverts just don't understand an introvert who takes time to think before talking and who does not engage in \\"small talk\\". I wish more people would take the time to read and think about the information in this book. The author made a strong case for the strengths of introverts.  I think this book  is especially important for people in business and education because introverts are a part of society and their needs should be addressed as much as those of extroverts.<br /><br />The book helped me to understand my introverted husband.

B004OW1F9K|5.0|love the show hate NBC the only reason CHUCK got to 5 seasons is because of the FANS. NBC can eat my nuts if you don't pull in ten million viewers an episode then u don't matter.  Yea CHUCK should of had some more reality tv singing and dancing and forensic crime scene solving,  Cuz those are the only shows that stay on the air and will ever get more than a 13 episode send off!!
B00138J14Y|4.0|This is probably his best work to date-which isn't to say it will be his best ever. My favorite track is Black Girl Lost because he went under her skirt on that one. He originated the gun/man metaphor with I Gave You Power.. that's nasty. Street Dreams is treacherous.. the beat is sick and his delivery is mad. Affirmative Action is ill.. you get a taste of The Firm on that. But.. my favorite song isn't the best song.. If I Ruled The World stands alone on this album.. he smashed that track--Lauren Hill only enhances the melody.. He elevated the content (no disrespect to Kurtis Blow). All in all.. the CD is worth having in your inventory. If it's not already a classic.. it will be soon.

B001GSV3EC|5.0|As the Joker rhetorically asked, \\"Where does he get all of these marvelous toys?\\" Once again, in a live recording, Jeff Beck lays claim to being the most gifted guitarist working in all contexts in the 21st century. Starting with \\"Truth\\", he has played his chosen instrument in such a way that it is self-evident that he has no equals.<br /><br />While his recorded output is starting to border on what would be considered over-kill, and over-exposure, with Jeff Beck we find that whether in the studio or recording live every CD seems to be essential. Initially, I thought that by purchasing the DVD of this Live Adventure with Tal (bass), Vinnie (drums), and Jason (keys), I would not need to purchase an audio recording also. Silly me, seeing them perform on DVD only increased my desire to have a CD for inspiration in the car, through headphones, on the home stereo speakers, or on the computer.<br /><br />So, do not be a chump, get this offering in both formats. (N.B., the DVD concert has lyrical performances by some very lovely and soulful female vocalists; some of these numbers are very nearly worth the price of admission.) Buy with confidence, and that is The Truth.
0061785652|4.0|A solid read and another good addition to the Sigma Force books.  Glad Rollins is starting to progress the story of The Guild a little bit and it should lead to a good next book.  I had become tired of the Sigma Force novels but the last two have picked up my interest in the series.  I started reading Rollins in 2001 when his third book (Deep Fathom) was released and I've always enjoyed his books.

B00845PV16|1.0|This is why i am not a fan of Marvel movies. Simply because hollywood always find a way to destroy a perfectly good comic. I would not recommend this to anyone. This is not even worthy of being on basic channels. Talk about destroying a good actor such as Nicolas Cage and destroying a good comic book such as Ghost Rider.

B0079XPUOW|3.0|If you love John Scalzi, and read his blog every day, you should definitely read this book, but then you probably already have, haven't you? If you are a Star Trek fan, you will likely also enjoy it, although the humor is very cerebral and metafiction-y, and it doesn't really read like the Star Trek parody it is. It's more about exploring the idea of story in general, and how authors relate to their characters.<br /><br />The biggest problem I had with this book was that it felt like a very long short story. Like the best short stories, it had a fantastic premise, and each character and situation fit together neatly to fulfill that premise with an interesting twist. But, because of its very premise, it was hard to relate to the characters as real people who progress and grow with time. I got it from the library and enjoyed it, but I probably wouldn't have felt it was worth it if I'd bought it.
B0088TG252|3.0|This movie reminds me of Unbreakable. Two great actors who have proven to hollywood that they can act, but yet did not go the extra mile that they have done in past movies. I would give it five stars if this was the two actors first movie, but judging by their past movies, this has to be the worst movie that they have ever been in. This movie i would say, cable worthy, and maybe redbox worthy. As for going to buy it or going to the theaters to see it, you should ask for a refund.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|Just as I was working on the last puzzle, I got an update with 25 more for a total of nearly 300. If you like this type of puzzle, this is a great selection ranging from simple to very challenging. Several of the puzzles have multiple solutions but I didn't find it much of an issue. The app is supposedly compatible with both my tablet and phone but it would be very difficult on a phone. The benefits of doing these puzzles on a tablet instead of paper are fairly obvious, the UI is good and you can easily undo or erase mistakes. The downside is that you need to pan and zoom a lot and it can be difficult to count and determine where you are on the grid. It's also easy to inadvertently change a square by touching the screen. I plan to email the authors with suggestions to make the UI even better.
B002BWP49C|4.0|I am a fan of the books and the movies-I thoroughly enjoy escaping into the world known as Twilight. This one is more on Romance and less on action, but there is some sweet moments, and even some humor, at least until Bella starts to suffer from the baby she's carrying... the last moments of the film are very well done.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|Food Inc. is a great documentary about agribusiness in America. The film traces the negative effects of the way these companies do business from your plate all the way back to the factory farms and petri dishes. Authors Michael Pollan and Eric Schlosser are among the people shedding light on the corporate controlled American food industry. It is not an easy film to watch, but it is important to see how your food gets to your table.
6301976622|5.0|Like new. Very pleased. Our church has lessons on the beginnings of demoninations that  sprange from the first church, Catholic.  This movie was recommended and did not dissapoint.
B006Z7Z3S6|5.0|Ti West's \\"The Innkeepers\\" is a tour de force, certainly superior to his debut \\"House of the Devil\\".  It seems to be a bit under appreciated judging by both the comments here and it's critical reception.  I'm not sure why.  It is a bit like peeling an onion but once you do, you don't cry--you scream.  This is psychological terror at it's most refined and disturbing.<br /><br />Sara Paxton plays Claire, a twenty something working at a reputedly haunted hotel just about to close.  Pat Healy plays the distant and sort of strange Luke, a middle aged man who also works the desk and claims to be interested in using EVP to uncover the hotel's infamous ghost, Madelin O Malley.  Madelin was stiffed on her wedding night, killed herself, and her body was stuffed in the trunk of the hotel's basement.<br /><br />For the first half hour of the film, none of this is given what one would call serious treatment.  Claire and Luke goof around, gossip about the famous aged actress played by Kelly McGillis, and it isn't until Claire begins to take the EVP quest seriously that it gets serious.<br /><br />This may lead the viewer to conclude the tragic ending of the film to be a consequence of Claire's overactive imagination or her asthma.  There are a few other things to consider, though.  Why does Lee, McGillis' character, arrive at night just before things get ghostly?  Why, before urging Claire to leave, does Luke say \\"I have something to tell you\\"?  Was his skepticism a mere front for something else he knew?  Why does Lee's facial profile look so much more youthful the last time we see her?<br /><br />Without giving anything away, it seems to me this is an infinitely more complex movie than most seem to realize.  Absolutely recommended for lovers of horror.  Watch carefully.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have a 7 month old son and this video has been the best purchase for my attempt at getting back into shape! I didn't realize how much time I would want to dedicate to my son, but turns out, it was ALL of it! So going to the gym or to my hour long yoga classes just isn't possible right now, especially since I work all day. I definitely recommend this to anyone who is short on time and is wanting something kick butt and fast to do in the comfort of your own home. I am able to wake up early and get this 20-23 minute workout done and outta the way and its TOUGH, so even though the workout is short, you definitely feel the butt kickin! Another plus, all you need is dumbbells and mat and not a lot of space. I can't speak for the '30-day shred' part of it, because I am not consistent enough to get those results, but my legs and arms are definitely toning and the baby weight is coming off. So bottom line, its quick, its difficult, but not impossible, and its a lot of fun and you will get results!<br />Oh another note....do each level for at least a week before you move on to the next. They definitely get harder so you don't want to discourage yourself but jumping to level 2, especially if you have been out of the game for a while, like myself.

B005LAIIS0|5.0|Hi.  Contrary to what some reviewers seem to think, this film wasn't produced as a survival guide for making it out of plane wrecks in Alaska alive.  Nor is it a nature documentary. The laws of physics are bent and sometimes broken.  The wolves don't act like wolves.  This is a flick about screwed-up guys finding peace in themselves.  Maybe the movie isn't for you, but for God's sake don't write it off because \\"an unrealistic amount of light is cast by burning sticks\\".
B004EPZ00C|5.0|Johnny English is back, reborn even. (Love the play of words on Bourne.) This time Johnny is a new, better, and improved man who has new skills to bring to the bad guys. I actually like the sequel Johnny English Reborn better than the first one because he's new, better, and improved...reborn. He's so suave and cool in the elevator listening to elevator music while the bad guy does things the hard way. He no longer does things the hard way in contrast to the other players who have not been reborn. Johnny's bumbles are just a part of him but his sophistication is unmatched.

B007U1FEJE|5.0|It's a dream come true. \\"That's Why God Made the Radio\\"caps a life long love affair with the boys who wrote the soundtrack to my life. I've been a Beach Boy fan since late 1963 and let me say this to the thankfully few people on this site that have panned this disc. You know nothing about this remarkable American band that has come so far and been through so much. You know nothing about their music, so I will just consider your uninformed opinions to be null and void. Enough said. On June 7th my wife and I listened to TWGMTR for the first time at our little condo which is 60 seconds from the beach in Ocean City MD where I worked as a beach boy during the summer of 1972. From the opening vocalise track \\"Think About the Days\\" to the final harmonies of \\"Summer's Gone\\" we were transported back in time and thrust forward into the present day by the stunning music on this disc. Brian Wilson comes to the rescue again with no less than 11 out of 12 songs on this beautiful collection of superbly crafted pieces. The last time The Beach Boys attempted to record a group effort like TWGMTR was in 1985 when they were still recovering from the drowning death of Dennis Wilson a couple of years prior. \\"The Beach Boys 1985\\" was a solid but ultimately uneven album (I still really like it though). It was another attempt to bring the troubled and reclusive brother Brian Wilson back into the fold even though the bulk of the burdon of recording this disc fell on the back of Carl Wilson, and cousin Mike Love. The next two discs \\"Still Crusin'\\" of 1987 and \\"Summer in Paradise\\" of 1992 fell flat when the band was under the control of Mike Love and rarely wind up under the blue light of the laser in my disc player. After an amazing decade on the road with his incredible back-up band and a couple of great solo albums plus a critically acclaimed resurrection of the long lost \\"Smile\\" album, Brian was recruited to provide the bulk of the music for \\"That's Why God Made the Radio\\",a 50th anniversary celebration of The Beach Boys long and winding road proving once again that he is a musical genius. Other reviewers on this site have described the tracks on this disc in detail. I won't. All I can say is that by the time the third song from the last \\"From There and Back Again\\", with a lead vocal by the mighty Al Jardine, started playing, I tilted my head back and let the tears of joy run down my cheeks. Carl and Dennis we still miss and love you. SURF'S UP!
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Midnight in Paris has everything you look for in a Woody Allen film right down to the jazz clarinet. It's a treat for those who heed the beckoning call of nostalgia. In this film, Gil, a writer, is bored with his job and longs for something more. While he and his fiance' are visiting Paris, the romantic Gil considers the option of moving to Paris to stay. His fiance' is not on the same page. Late one night after dinner, Gil takes a midnight stroll and gets whisked away from his mundane life to his favorite era of Paris in the 1920's where he hobnobs with the great artists of the day. Gil is smitten with this nostalgic retreat from the ordinary. His romanticism clashes with his fiance's modern materialism. I won't give away the ending.

B004EPYZUS|4.0|This is one of the stronger entries in the Mission Impossible franchise. Things I liked: The plot is coherent. A chase in a sandstorm is one of the more innovative chase scenes I've seen in awhile, surpassed only by a chase in one of those automated European parking garages. The unlikely high tech gear that IMF always uses is subject to unexpected failure in this movie (just like it would be in the real world). Unlike some earlier MI movies, there are welcome elements of humor in this one. Things I didn't like: Not much chemistry between Cruise and Paula Patton. The whole \\"crazy guy steals launch codes to set off nuclear Armageddon\\" idea is pretty stale. On the whole, there's nothing deep about this movie but it's fun, a good thrill ride for action movie fans.
B000FZETKC|3.0|This movie was for my wife. Hope she likes it I haven't bn able to watch it. I accidentally erased this movie on our DVr and she was very upset. So I went to amazon cause they seem to have everything I need and found it at a very low price. So glad cause she like those old movies.

It's a cute toy but I don't recommend it for older babies.

B007N5YJYS|4.0|***Spoiler Warning***<br /><br />Strangely, this was my very first Hitchcock film. Strange because I didn't realize it until more than a decade had passed and having knowingly enjoyed many other of his productions over those same years.<br /><br />First screened when I was a little kid and loved for the clever mystery and Hitch's trademark rapier repartee infused screenplay. Additionally, have always had a soft spot for anything related to the 'wrong man' scenario; of being unjustly indicted and chased by misguided authorities. The very first of, if not the precursor to, all later films and programs like '[[ASIN:B00005ATZT The Fugitive]]'.<br /><br />Stars Robert Donat, long a forgotten performer whose incredible skill earned him two Oscar nominations, including a win for Best Actor. Sad that his terrific thespian crafted works are no longer remembered, while most can name every slack-jawed exhibitionist clown amongst a variety of pathetic reality tv shows.<br /><br />Anyway, when this very early Hitchcock movie was written and produced in 1935, the Nazis were just beginning to beat their war drums; the election of The Stunted Mustache two years previous, in 1933, solidifying his twisted base over the German nation made that threat very real. Tensions between the jackboots and the free world were high to say the least. Spies were a true-life genuine threat, the shadow war over tactical and technical information between the Fatherland and UK was already years old before the actual physical call to arms.<br /><br />Thrown onto this volatile powder keg is Donat's character Richard Hannay. A visiting Canadian who finds himself accused of murder. However, it turns out that the victim wasn't an ordinary person, but a freelance intelligence operative who randomly chose him to escape her pursuers. And under his protection, was killed while attempting to expose a plot against Britain. As a loyal crown citizen, Hannay picks up the task of uncovering the truth and simultaneously proving his own innocence. But the authorities don't know that. And worse, the opposition spy network is out to silence him by any means necessary, including framing him as a deranged spree killer.<br /><br />His only clues to escape the hangman's noose and/or anonymous shallow grave: A secret rendezvous, a missing finger, and the strange phrase \\"The 39 Steps\\".<br /><br />Because Hannay is an amateur, his moves are unpredictable, and therefore his only reliable hope of evading the ever growing target on his back. And a chance encounter with Madeleine Carroll's character Pamela, provides the cover he needs. Unfortunately, she  believes the news reports that he is indeed a madman and murderer. Knowing that she'll turn him in, Richard cheekily adopts the role of \\"villain\\", threatening her with death should she attempt to cry out or escape.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, as the handcuffed pair doggedly work their way past a nest of cloak-n-dagger baddies, she makes a break for freedom. And just as Pamela attempts to reach out to a pair of police officers, she accidentally eavesdrops on a hushed conversation. Stunned, she discovers that Richard was telling the truth all along; that dark forces are indeed at play to silence him before he gets a chance to tell his tale. Vindicated and realizing the stakes of Hannay's mission, the pair race to London in a final bid to prevent technical plans for a silent aircraft engine from leaving Britain.<br /><br />Again, for many years, a wholly unknown Hitch favorite; one that I regularly re-screened during rainy days. I'm grateful to Criterion for putting their technical and artistic skills in digitally remastering this engaging action/adventure/mystery. Simultaneously freeing me from an old beat-to-death VHS tape which engages with some frightening crunchy sounds soon after the introductory credits, thus explaining my ignorance of the director for so many years.<br /><br />Movie Note:<br /><br />- I believe this is the very first time a \\"stealth\\" aircraft is mentioned in the plot of a movie<br /><br />Personal Note:<br /><br />- For some reason whenever a fit of insomnia hits me, and just like the movie, Mr. Memory's musical introduction worms its way into a maddening mental loop of whistling.e a \\"stealth\\" aircraft is mentioned in the plot of a movie<br /><br />Personal Note:<br /><br />- For some reason whenever a fit of insomnia hits me, and just like the movie, Mr. Memory's musical introduction worms its way into a maddening mental loop of whistling.
006198969X|5.0|I am a 15 year old girl and I am completely into style and beauty. This book has both in it and as soon as I started reading it, I couldn't stop. I finished this book in two short days. This book was relatively inexpensive, so I was able to purchase this and some other style and beauty books along with this one. I have read all of the other books and none of them grabbed my attention the way this one did. There are many illustrations inside so you can see exactly what she is talking about from layering shirts to putting on red lipstick. Her tips have helped me shop better, spend my money on more essential things, and piece together pieces of my wardrobe that I wouldn't have pieced together before. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn a little more about the fun world of fashion.

B0006J28BO|2.0|For about half an hour, this Japanese cartoon seems like a promising and intermittently almost charming adventure. Haru, an unmotivated high school girl who has just a minimal rapport with cats, saves one particular cat by pushing him out of the way of a truck. After he stands on his hind legs and thanks her (in human language), she begins to realize that he is the prince of a most unusual cat population.<br /><br />The plot goes sour when the fearful Haru is kidnapped by a feline mob and whisked away to the royal court of an alternative universe called the Kingdom of Cats. It's a \\"dangerous place\\" whose denizens are generally grotesque and murderous--especially the Cat King, a fat, lazy, gruff, sadistic caricature who is bent on rewarding Haru's good deed by metamorphosing her into a cat and forcing her to marry his strangely absent son.<br /><br />SPOILERS. Ultimately, the only conspicuously likable inhabitants of this court are the prince (who bears not the slightest resemblance to his father except in coloration) and the shy white cat he really wants to marry, both of whose lives Haru had evidently saved when they were in her everyday world. It would be gratifying to observe that her kindness is amply rewarded, but the one who actually rescues Haru is the Baron, an elegant cat statue who befriended her back at the magical Cat Bureau on the outskirts of Tokyo; he suddenly displays supernatural powers that he should have called into play a good deal earlier. Along the way, no fewer than five cats have fallen to their deaths--and that was before the Cat King used a detonator to blow up the high tower that his prospective daughter-in-law and her friends were frantically climbing. Comic relief (?) has also been provided by more than a dozen malicious cats yelping in pain as movable brick walls fell over on them. What age group is this supposed to please?<br /><br />(I know, the old Warner Brothers cartoons were full of comic-book violence, too, but those were usuallyless than 10 minutes long. In terms of content sensitivity, has there been any progress in 60 years, or are we moving in the wrong direction?)<br /><br />This whole silly fantasy seems like a bad dream, and personally, I don't see how it can have much appeal for either cat lovers or cat haters. Notice how practically all the cats in the story are either weak and vulnerable or fat / self-centered / evil / distasteful except a manmade statue--a statue of a cat walking upright and deftly tailored like some trim human lordling, not to say Prince Charming.<br /><br />Yes, occasional moments display a touch of visual beauty or a trace of tenderness, and there is a hint of a moral about appreciating our ordinary lives--or is the film saying, as several characters initially suggest, that saving a cat's life just means asking for trouble? I get it: Risk your life out of compassion for a cat and you risk the unthinkable curse of spending your whole life as a cat--and a cat's consort--unless you can be restored to your humanity by an alluring hybrid creature like the Baron, who is less catlike than human (this is unmistakably a new spin on \\"Beauty and the Beast\\"). So that's why Haru finally loses interest in her high-school crush! Perhaps she has not learned self-sufficiency at all; she has merely learned to believe in fairytale reality and a fairytale hero.<br /><br />I'm not making this up. As the story draws to a close, the clumsy, uncharismatic Haru, looking happy at last, assures her best friend that she no longer cares about that high school boy Machida. Almost immediately, we hear a young woman singing a love song about looking forward to being together again, which continues as the final credits roll. Our 17-year-old heroine has fallen in love with her spiritual guide, in the form of an old statue of an anthropoidal cat that sometimes comes to life. And she had thought that a real cat would be the wrong choice for her to love!<br /><br />Speaking of music: Undeniablyone of the film's assets is Yuji Nomi's symphonic score, which echoes various styles from the tail end of the romantic era (Ravel, Mahler, Prokofiev, and others) as well as later Hollywood composers. But the English-language soundtrack, dubbed in at the Disney studios, is not just annoyingly jivey and marred by lapses in logic (why do we hear that the sun is coming up in a land where it is always noon?). It also reveals that the old Disney tradition of racism is not entirely dead: Tim Curry, as the evil Cat King, seems to be putting on an African-American accent, while Cary Elwes, as the noble Baron, affects a refined British one. On the DVD, one can avoid such distractions by watching the movie in Japanese with English subtitles. Those subtitles, however, duplicate the Disney team's slang-ridden script adaptation (without the minor mistakes and alterations introduced by the dubbing actors); the text is obviously not a close match for the original Japanese. Near the end, we are even shown \\"translations\\" of a few lines that no one is saying at all on the Japanese soundtrack.<br /><br />In short, my advice would be: Skip this one and watch _Whisper of the Heart_, where the same suave Baron character appears in a far more believable and meaningful story--one where cats, sculpted or otherwise, speak our language only when the heroine is dreaming.
B000H6SXMY|2.0|I bought this same set - in China. I've no doubt that I did get the same set because, besides identical packaging, my wife and I encountered the exact same playback problems that many of you have talked about. In China, for what we paid, I can't complain. But I don't understand why a good quality set isn't available in the US market. \\"Friends\\" was a smash hit TV series. And yet I can tell you for a fact that this set is China market quality. Because we enjoy the show so much, we were planning to buy a set in the US from Amazon, until I read the reviews about all the disc problems (that my wife and I are already all too familiar with). I hope that in the future, Amazon will be able to offer a high quality set.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|for a free game I am very impressed with it it is very time consuming I find myself wanting to pick up my kindle more than my controller.
B001VLXNLU|4.0|I was up late one night and needed a new book to read. So I read a couple of pages of this one and decide to try it because of the cost. I loved it. I flew through it. I think it's crazy that I'm in my 30s and I'm totally engrossed in these stories. I cry with the characters, get angry and sometimes a little hot and bothered. I understand that the books are a little toned down but not nearly enough. It is graphic enough that no daughter of mine would be reading this at 12. I agree this is young adult but 7th grade 12 years old is not a young adult in my book it is a child. I repeat THIS IS NOT FOR CHILDREN. However, mom I think you would enjoy it. October 16, 2012 can't come soon enough (the release date of the 10th book Hidden) for me.

B005LLSNNE|5.0|I am disappointed because I spent the money to view the season which is AMAZING; however I am severely hard of hearing and rely on closed captions.  This series through the Kindle Fire doesn't have the captions so it was so hard to follow for me.  I have to spend the money and buy the discs if I want to watch it or wait until Sept. to watch it on Netflix.  I really don't want to wait that long because this show is so amazing.

B004V5QWU2|5.0|I enjoy this app for it's beautiful sound. The white noise seemed a little off, but babbling brook is my favorite one, and it's better than that girl named brook I. my class babbling on and on about nothing. :)
1612130283|1.0|Received all 3 books as a gift. I am so glad that I did not waste my money on them, but wish that my niece had not spent hers. At this time, there are about 3200 five star reviews and 2200 one star reviews. I felt compelled to write to try to even the score.<br /><br />Anyway, how sad is it when a book like this - so poorly written, with unbelievable, even unlikable characters is so successful? It reminds me of the Kardashians. They have managed to insinuate themselves into our daily lives without any real reason other than a sex tape and the ability to somehow make us think they matter.  At least I (or in this case my niece) did not actually pay any money that directly supports them like she did for these books.<br /><br />Not having any preconceived notions when I started reading, it did not take me long to really dislike the characters. Had I embraced them, I would not have started picking apart every stupid thing about the book - from the fact that she \\"didn't think she was pretty\\", with her too wide eyes, and how she'd \\"forget to eat\\" (and lose 5 pounds in 2 days), and dang! she just never could get the hang of makeup... apparently she never needed it because everyone else knew what an absolute goddess she was.<br /><br />I could go on about what everyone else has said - the \\"holy crap\\", the \\"down there\\" the \\"inner goddess\\" and that dang lip biting, but what absolutely set my teeth on edge the most, was the fact that she whispered throughout a large portion of the dialog, like she was a little girl.  This just kills me. And the fact that Christian thinks she has \\"spunk\\" eminently laughable.<br /><br />I can't tell you how many times I rolled my eyes, leafed through the pages to see how much more there was, and put the book down in disgust. I managed to get through the first one, and tried to start the second, but I could not go any further. I cheated and read the end of both the second and third, and I don't even have to read more, I know just what happens in book 2 and 3.<br /><br />As I reread this, I realize that I am actually somewhat jealous of the author. She has laughed all the way to the bank on suckers like us. Three books with hardly enough story for one,  talk of the movie rights, et. Gotta hand it to her though ,-  just like the Kardashians.

B007BT0RKG|1.0|So I thought this would be handy for any little road trip I might decide to take. So I downloaded it with ease. Then opened it. What? Only major highways were shown. It didn't even have a road to get to my town from the major cities nearby. It gets one star because I can't give it a -5.

0345803485|5.0|I am more a a DIY person, not one to sit and read. Once I downloaded the trilogy, it was over.  I couldn't stop.  I read all three in less than three weeks.  I loved how complex Christian is, how innoscent Ana is, and yet, they are so perfect for one another.  How in each book, their relationship grows and Christian is more open to emotions and Ana tries \\"new things\\". It's not about the lust, the sex, it's about a young couple from two completely different worlds, finding eachother unexpectedly and falling madly in love with one another.  I THINK THE AUTHOR IS BRILLIANT!!!
B004UID2LC|5.0|I absolutely love this app. It does exactly what I want it to do! Which is work with ease! It's a simple download, easy to get to know  without any hassle.
159514188X|4.0|I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this novel.<br /><br />Yes, it was horribly sad and made me cry my eyes out time and time again and I definitely felt the emotional connection with the main characters. I can also understand how someone would end his or her life because I've been at that low point more than once, and know what it's like to feel like just a joke to everyone.<br /><br />However, while some of the reasons why Hannah chose suicide were reasonable, a few were not. This is where my dilemma rests. Some of the reasons just seemed like petty issues not worth batting an eyelash over. Having been bullied in high school, I know that things can seem overwhelming at times.<br /><br />Regardless of how I feel, the message was loud and clear: Even the simplest act, good or bad, can have unimaginable consequences to those around us, and we should be more careful about our interactions.<br /><br />Suicide is never an answer to your problems. Mainly because even though you are gone, your family and friends will then have to deal with the aftermath, and in no way is that a fair trade-off.<br /><br />Overall, the novel made quite an impression on me, and I'm glad to have read it.
B00881VLCE|5.0|found this app to run smoothly and easily on my kindle fire... great pics and fun to figure out. all ages above six and great for adults.
B003XMKMTQ|5.0|I stumbled across this kinda buy accident and absolutely fell in love with it.

At the least it rivals James Taylor Live at the Beacon Theater.  Highly recommended and an absolute bargain!!

0743298039|5.0|I will not begin to guess precisely the time-period in which this book resides. Up until a certain point in the story, I had believed it was set in present-day story. Imagine my surprise when I discovered nothing contemporary about it!<br /><br />Even after hearing the words \\"Gothic\\" and \\"Jane Eyre\\"-esque as descriptions for this novel, I had not connected the dots to realize the story would have an old-world feel and charm about it.<br /><br />The first few lines drew me in, as should happen with any great novel. Only a few paragraphs later, as Vida's letter was being read, I was hooked and could not put it down. Not that I wanted to, because I was compelled to find out what happened, what the backstory was, who was lying, who died, and who this Vida Winter person really was.<br /><br />Everything I love about a novel- the ease of reading but not being stupid, the depth of characters, the layering of events, and of course the suspense- are deep within this novel, from the very first sentence to the very last.<br /><br />A must read. No matter what you are doing right now, go out and buy this novel today.

0345803485|1.0|OK, I admit I read this.  I'm a single guy and every woman I know told me to read this.  This review is for the guys that are considering reading this.  One sentence summary:  housewife fantasy, written for the bored suburban Mom.<br /><br />Fellas, first, let me tell you that the protagonist (Christian Grey) is something that none of us could ever be: 29, dead handsome, a billionaire, a concert pianist, and has an enormous ding-dong that \\"springs out of his pants\\".  Despite the fact that he's a billionaire he's got all the time in the world to chase down his 22-year-old girlfriend, take vacations at the drop of a hat, and drives his own car.  Any firm he's CEO of- I'm not investing!  Since none of us can be like this, none of us will have this fantasy happen to us, so don't think you're going to find your wife/gf/etc throwing themselves at you as you have your lawyer write a contract for a BDSM relationship.<br /><br />Secondly, the heroine in the book \\"Anastasia\\" is supposedly this 22 year old, just out of college gal who is also a virgin.  She has an orgasm just by looking at Mr. Grey.  Nevermind that EVERY time they hook up she experiences a climax.  For a newbie to sex I'm pretty impressed-  she seems to know herself as well as any porn star.  If she were my daughter I'd be smacking myself for raising such a deviant.  OK, maybe not- she is 22, but still, the whole Ana character isn't very likable.  I wouldn't have much respect for a woman that wanted to be my \\"sub\\".  That's just me though.<br /><br />Third, the writing is truly horrible.  There's no character development worth earning any empathy from me.  I would go easier on this book if it was well written.  It's not.  There's some big vocabulary thrown in during conversation, but given the level at which this is written I'd believe that the author had a thesaurus handy during her writing.<br /><br />Last, the sex scenes.  OK, they're definitely out there... not your run of the mill stuff most of us are used to.  Do people really do the dom/sub thing?  I'm sure they do.  I also doubt they're nearly as refined as the two main characters in this book.  They're somewhat entertaining but I honestly didn't find them that erotic.  Do yourself a favor- pick up a subscription to Penthouse Forum.  You'll get a lot more ideas and it has pictures, too.  If you're not into Forum, at least research some erotica on Amazon- I would imagine most is better than this.<br /><br />Overall, this is some fun housewife porn written for women.  I really hope younger people (18-22 year olds) wouldn't read this and think that there's a shred of human reality to the dynamic between Grey and Ana.  I was flamed for my review of Amanda Beard's book- this is exactly the kind of crap I'm sure she's reading!to.  Do people really do the dom/sub thing?  I'm sure they do.

B002DOSBMK|5.0|As I read this book, I was amazed by the amount of personal struggle Drizzt had to go through to live the way he wanted, even in a cruel society where everything he stood for was rejected. The author did a great job at balancing the setting with the actual plot so you can get the full effect of what is really going on. Every chapter ending leads you to more questions and urges you to read me. If you're looking for story that outlines adventure, fantasy, inner struggle, and the difficulty of rejecting the norms of society, this is the book for you!
B0079R8KO0|5.0|I already have the Marware Jurni case for my Kindle Fire and though I love it, the fact that you have to hold it in your hands is fine for regular reading but not so great for viewing and reading when traveling.  This Marware Vibe case on the other hand is great for air travel because the ability to stand the Fire on the tray table on a 14 hour flight is a huge benefit.  The case is comfortable in the hand and the Fire is held in place securely.  I do prefer the zipper on the Jurni for everyday use (protecting my Fire from everything in my purse) but the design of the Vibe is perfect for travel.  Great product that in combination with the Jurni meets all my Fire protection needs!
B001FAZYOQ|5.0|After hearing about Bowie from a friend of mine in London I bought 4 tickets to one of these shows. Needless to say we were blown away! We'd only heard 'Space Oddity' and 'Starman' up to that point. The energy and rawness make this the best live Bowie album. The band was his best ever. Mick Ronsons playing was truly inspired---full of passion and originality. I'll never forget the looks on my friends faces when the show started! They said, \\"These guys sure look weird but they're really good!\\"
0802798225|5.0|In Perfect Chemistry Brittany Ellis is someone who everyone sees as the perfect girl, leading the perfect life. It's a lie, but one she almost obsessively wants everyone to believe. In reality, she's got a sister with a disability, a mother who has her own issues and who is the reason she's so obsessed with appearances and a father who spends most of his time working. Alex Fuentes is a gangbanger, a member of the Latino Blood and someone who no one really wants to mess with. The rumors about him exaggerate things he's done, but, like Brittany, he doesn't mind the rumors that are spread about him. He's in the gang because his father, also in the LB, was killed in front of Alex when he was young, and Alex was encouraged to join to protect his family. He also wants to use the gang connections to find out who killed his father and to get revenge on that person (this is something that the reader could probably guess how it would turn out).<br /><br />When a teacher who insists on seating by alphabetical order forces the two to be chemistry partners for the year, neither is particularly happy about it. While hanging out with his friends, Alex makes a bet about Brittany and has no plans on losing it. But, as the two get  to know and see each other in ways they don't let some of their friends see, they realize that they had a lot wrong about the other. As things with his gang heat up, Alex has some tough decisions to make about his future, though getting out of the gang doesn't really seem to be an option. And Brittany has to decide if appearances really do matter so much that you deny yourself what you really want.<br /><br />I read a lot of YA, but usually it's paranormal. A lot of the contemporary YA I see seems like it would be too much about this guy liked me, then dumped me and just teen things that might be a little young for me, or it goes the opposite direction and is about really depressing topics. After reading Perfect Chemistry, I'd absolutely be willing to givemore contemporary YA books a try. Yes, there's a lot of cussing, some drugs, sex (not much, and I thought it was handled really well) and violence (though I'd bet there's a lot more in reality when it comes to gangs), but what do you expect from a book where one of the main characters is in a gang? The book went back and forth between Alex and Brittany's POVs, which I really like in books and it worked very well in this one. We really get to see what the other is thinking, even if their actions indicate something totally different, and I just loved the main characters. There were plenty of secondary characters, parents (who mostly pissed me off) and friends of both Alex and Brittany, but we don't find out as much about them as we could have (I would've liked to have more of Alex's friend, Isa). While it would've been nice, it didn't hurt the book overall.<br /><br />I know I mentioned that one of the reasons I don't read much contemporary YA is because they might be depressing and you might be saying to yourself, \\"Is a book where both characters are basically living a lie, one's in a gang and the other has to deal with always being perfect a laugh riot?\\" Especially when there are a lot of serious topics in this book like physical and mental disabilities, gangs, etc.? No, but it's not as heavy as you might think. There are moments of humor and Elkeles made the characters seem very real. And, while the author could have gotten overly preachy about any of the issues in this book, she didn't. Other than one little blip in the epilogue (I just thought it was a little far fetched, but nothing that would even slightly ruin anything.), I loved Perfect Chemistry and look forward to reading, not only more of Elkeles' books (I've already ordered a couple, including the next book in this series), but more contemporary YA, period.
B0081L391C|2.0|As the forty year old virgin age of humor came to an end with Walk Hard we get these millinel kids showing us they do indeed watch reruns and wish they had been part of a more exciting decade.  You know these seth rogan movies were no longer funny after green hornet.  But these well connected show biz kids certainly have chutzpah.  Further testament that the nineties weren't that interesting of a decade as hollywood has broken their cardinal rule and are still drawing from the 1980's.  The twenty year rule insists that they only try and rehash the 1990's.  Further testament that American culture stop being interesting after Seinfeld.

0547258305|4.0|\\"Graceling\\" is a teen fantasy (true fantasy with castles and princesses) about a young woman named Katsa who is \\"graced\\" with the ability to fight to survive. She is strong and powerful, but this gift hasn't always been easy to live with. Her cruel and selfish uncle, King Randa, seeks to use her grace for his own purposes, and when Katsa dares to defy his wishes, she leaves his palace for further pursuits. Her new friend, Po, is a Lienid fighter whose grandfather was kidnapped by the evil King Leck. They set out to discover the truth and to save Leck's young daughter, Bitterblue. Po and Katsa grow to love each other, but Katsa doesn't know how to deal with Po's secret, powerful grace.<br /><br />I've read a lot of reviews that trash Katsa and say she's not a feminist character, which I don't understand. Katsa is not perfect and she closes herself off, but she is also complex and very vulnerable. Something I really enjoyed about this book was the sisterhood Katsa held with other women. Too many YA books have these teen girls who hate other girls for petty reasons and only dote on men. Katsa has a strong sense of protection and a great love for other girls. Her love scenes with Po were very emotional, but I also loved the tender teaching moments between her and Bitterblue and the begrudging mother-daughter relationship with Helda. She wants to save and protect and she refuses to sit down and let others take care of her problems. She lives in a patriarchal setting but has a decidingly unfeminine grace, which makes her a powerful protector of the other women who may not have her gifts and skills. I loved Katsa and I admire her.<br /><br />Like I said, this book has slow parts. It reminded me of \\"Mockingjay\\" by Suzanne Collins or \\"Crossed\\" by Ally Condie. There was just too much transition and it got a little dull. But the ending was great although quite sad. This book will surprise you, and I definitely recommend it, especially to young fantasty fans.<br /><br />I'm nervous about reading the sequels, because I heard they have nothing to do with this book. I want to read more about Katsa and Po! But I would love reading about other graced characters. I'd give the other books a shot.

B007IXWKUK|1.0|The book is frustrating because I can see glimpses of potential in the characters, but the author never develops their potential. The male character is the most dynamic. The female character is poorly developed and one dimensional.  The plotting is sloppy and poor. The book needed a better editor.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|this game is time consuming,  fun,  and uses a strategy. i recomend it!!! :) i love one direction ( 1D) :)))
0380730405|3.0|The tone of this novel is so dark and bleak and mysterious that opening the book to a new page feels like crawling into a bed draped in red velvet and black satin while a thunderstorm rages outside your window over the sea. Yeah, its that depressing. There is not mistaking the tone of \\"Rebecca\\", that wasn't the issue. I had issues with the total lack of a cohesive theme.<br /><br />The beginning was slow but I warmed to it quickly. The young, unnamed protagonist, an orphan charge of a wealthy and insufferable woman named Mrs. Van Hopper, falls unexpectedly in love with Max de Winter while attending her mistress in Monte Carlo. She agrees to marry him and is whisked off on a short honeymoon before going back to Max's estate in the West Country, Manderley. Mrs. de Winter tries hard to draw Max into a loving and fulfilling relationship, but she soon learns that Max's first wife Rebecca still haunts the halls with her larger-than-life presence after he accidental drowning a year before. Mrs. Danvers, the housekeeper, seems to hate Mrs. de Winter, and she wonders why her presence as the new wife seems to unwelcome at Manderley. Nothing is what it seems to be, and Mrs. de Winter discovers the secret behind Rebecca and Max's relationship, which could ruin their future as man and wife.<br /><br />There is really no comment on the protagonist because she has absolutely no voice and no real role in the novel. She reminds me of Nick in \\"The Great Gatsby\\"- a narrator who is more of an observer than a central character. She is very meek and deferential and we really don't know much about her. I know it is central to the novel that she is pushed aside and not given anything to do, but I was waiting for her to gain a voice and stand up for herself, and it never really happened. I'm glad there was some hope for her and Max at the end, because for most of the novel, the tone just made everything feel doomed from the start.<br /><br />I had trouble grasping what this novel was reallyabout. Was it a tragic romance, with the young couples' love hindered by the foreboding dead first wife, or was it a crime mystery? It only reminded me of \\"Jane Eyre\\" in tone, not in plot.<br /><br />I gave this novel four stars because of the parts of the novel when Mrs. de Winter believes she will never be able to take the place of Rebecca. There was so much sadness and despair, and the writing was so beautiful, and I really felt for the narrator. But then everything changed and I had no real reason to feel bad, and that sort of ruined my reading experience.<br /><br />This is a weird book. The imagery of Manderley is so gorgeous and vivid; I felt like I was really there for some parts. But the plot was too twisty and there was no unified conflict from start to finish. I don't think I'd read it again, but I'm glad I gave it a shot. It was well-written, but the plot twist didn't impress me.

B002TVQ4HG|4.0|\\"Triangle\\" is a well thought and clevery made psychological horror and I liked it a lot. It was made on a budget and without any major stars being present, but I think it actually did this film a lot of good.<br /><br />The charm of this film is all in the story, its twists and its secrets - and so I will not reveal anything other than the opening sequence: a young woman comforts a hysterically sobbing little boy (her son) and once he stops crying explains him, that Mummy is just taking this one day off to go make a tour on sailing boat with friends. The rest of the film is for you to discover... Let's just say one thing - one should REALLY think twice before boarding the Flying Dutchman, because there may very well be NO ESCAPE from this seven times cursed ship!<br /><br />The atmosphere in \\"Triangle\\" is a mixture of weird and scary, but even if it progressively gets scarier and scarier it never gets too weird. The director kept the film very strictly under control and therefore there is no obvious plot holes or useless scenes. Thanks God there is also no any kind of absurd \\"final battle\\" scenes which hurt so many thrillers and horrors. The ending (last 5 minutes) is quite clever - and chilling... Melissa George did a very very good job in this film and helped a lot to make it a success as her character (Jess) is the center of all the story and all other actors play (very honestly) supporting roles.<br /><br />\\"Triangle\\" may not be a masterpiece, but it is one of the best, most intelligent, scariest and best made horrors I saw in recent years. I can not exactly say that I enjoyed it, because there is a deep sadness in it (after all it is about a really terrifying CURSE - and they are rarely funny), but I am very glad that I discovered it. Enjoy!

B000U618C8|5.0|This is a very well done album.  Jose Gonzales is a very talented musician, and deserves more recognition.  The album is very short (less than 30 min), but I could listen to the album over and over, so it doesn't matter.  It would be a waste not to buy this album!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|What can I say about this book that can truly show just how amazing it was? Nothing. My words totally fail me here. This is a funny book. This is a raw book. This is a sad book. This is a book that made me readjust the way I see the world. This is an incredible book -- and incredibly moving book. Masterful!<br /><br />Hazel is the narrator of this book, a sixteen year old girl who has spent the past three years of her life battling cancer and dealing with all of the side effects of this disease. Her lungs are filled with fluid, causing her pain and an unnerving sense of drowning at times. Hazel is funny and real. In a tragic situation she could say so many things that were absolutely hilarious. She was a great narrator for this story. People treat her differently because of her disease, and she really just wants to not have to deal with it. Who wouldn't feel that way? One of the requirements that her parents have for her is that she attend a support group for cancer kids, and normally this drives her crazy, but one day she shows up and meets Augustus Waters, bone cancer survivor who is attending to support his friend Isaac who is getting ready to lose his last good eye to cancer.<br /><br />Augustus is amazing! I love this boy so much! He is funny and caring and insightful. He doesn't treat Hazel differently. He treats her normally, and this is exactly what Hazel needs. Except that Hazel is afraid to allow anyone to really love her because she doesn't want to be a \\"grenade\\" when she dies, leaving mourning and broken people in her wake because of their love for her. So she keeps her distance from Augustus. At first. But Augustus is hard to resist, and seeing this blooming romance was magical for me.<br /><br />I really don't want to spoil any of the experience of this book, so I won't go into further detail. I'll just say this ... keep some tissues handy. It takes a lot to make me cry during a book. A lot. I don't do it often. In fact, so many of the reviews of this book talked about people crying, so I was expecting to cry. Then when a big tragic moment occurs in the story I didn't find myself crying right away, so I began to question what was wrong with me. Well, I questioned myself too soon because I found that it was not in dying that tragedy occurs, but it is in living after the death of someone we love. Those were the moments that touched me deeply, and those moments in this book were written beautifully. So beautifully.<br /><br />One Augustus quote that I loved:<br /><br />You don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world, old man, but you do have some say in who hurts you. I like my choices. I hope she likes hers.<br /><br />Love that boy! Love this story! It is a definite must read book for everyone! Five HUGE stars!!!book talked about people crying, so I was expecting to cry.

B007UQ5Z1G|4.0|I was one of the seemingly few people who stuck up for Linkin Park when they released their 3rd album in 2007, \\"Minutes To Midnight.\\" I could admit that \\"Hybrid Theory\\" and \\"Meteora\\" had been much better albums, but I was glad to see the band try new things; something they would have to do lest their fans become bored with a fading genre. However, in 2010 I completely rejected \\"A Thousand Suns,\\" not because it was different (I wanted them to take some risks) but because it seemed like a mess. The songs didn't flow together, and a lot of moments just seemed like noise. After my expectations were gone, I eventually grew to appreciate several tracks from that album, in fact I'd say it was some of their smartest material yet. It was enough to make me bite for one more album, which brings us to \\"Living Things.\\"<br /><br />It's funny, back in 2009 the band released a song called \\"New Divide\\" for the Transformers sequel. At that time they were working on \\"A Thousand Suns\\" and they stressed several times that \\"New Divide\\" was not any kind of indication of how their upcoming album would sound. The reason that's funny to me is become I think it was a very big indication of how THIS album sounds. In fact the first single, \\"Burn It Down,\\" is almost like the same song. The format of the song is pretty basic, but I think it has a strong chorus that people at concerts could sing along to. I would very much describe \\"Living Things\\" as the missing link between \\"Minutes To Midnight\\" and \\"A Thousand Suns.\\" It's sort of a mix of everything they've done so far. So while it may not show Linkin Park evolving in any specific direction, it does offer a variety to keep things interesting. \\"Lost In The Echo\\" sets the tone for the album and isn't unlike what you would expect after hearing the first single, but it is catchy. \\"Lies Greed Misery\\" has some great rapping from Mike Shinoda and a wicked chorus from Chester Bennington. I love when these guys trade vocals back and forth rather than handling it solo. \\"Castle Of Glass\\" is likely to be a single, it's a melodic tune that isn't bad but I also didn't find it very memorable after my first 2 listens so far. \\"Victimized\\" is very short but it's fast and more raw than anything the band has done in many years. \\"Until It Breaks\\" is fun because the song makes several unexpected yet welcome changes. Overall, this is a strong album from LP, and I think fans stuck in the the \\"Hybrid Theory\\" days will like this one at least a tiny bit more than their last 2 albums. I denied this album a 5th star because there's still some filler material on here, but probably less than the last 2 albums had. Nice job, Linkin Park.dling it solo. \\"Castle Of Glass\\" is likely to be a single, it's a melodic tune that isn't bad but I also didn't find it very memorable after my first 2 listens so far. \\"Victimized\\" is very short but it's fast and more raw than anything the band has done in many years. \\"Until It Breaks\\" is fun because the song makes several unexpected yet welcome changes.

B007WEYGPC|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite books. It deals with many important issues, exposes the ugly ignorance of prejudice, the innocence of children and the influence adults have over them. Everyone should read it, especially children and even more so in an age where bullying and taunting is so prevalent. The writing is beautiful, the theme of tolerance is moving, and the relationship between Atticus Finch and his children both loving and entertaining. The book leaves its reader feeling good. Thoroughly recommend it.
B0001Z37HM|4.0|Okay, no one here is in Oscar contention, let's get that out of the way. But if you take it at face value, it is a decent popcorn movie. The story is okay, the scenery is beautiful and the action is compelling. Bridgette Nielson is beautiful and her sword fighting is fun to watch. Meanwhile the Actor's Studio is not going to have anyone watch Ms. Nielsen and Mr. Schwarzenegger (playing a \\"Conan\\" like figure) anytime soon. I was replacing my old VHS tapes and had just purchased the two \\"Conan\\" movies - so I bought this too. It had been a decade or more since I watched it last, and it was still a pretty fun movie to watch, I've certainly watched worse (\\"Blair Witch 2\\" I'm talking to you).

B0070UFMOW|4.0|I just got this thing yesterday, and, boy, am I disappointed.  A review in a respected magazine inpired me to jump on the portable headphone amp/DAC wagon.  When it came, I was first disappointed to see no instructions at all, just a little fold-out card with tiny writing, which mainly only identified the various buttons and inptut/outputs. I charged it first, since that seemed logical. I began tryng to fiddle with the settings this morning, and found things somewhat frustrating, so I actually looked up the original article I mentioned earlier online, and read it again. Their guy said it was all so easy to use, that he never even looked at the \\"instructions\\". Ha! I guess he does this stuff all the time. I'm usually not bad at getting computers and electronics to work myself, but this just confused me. Okay, so time to listen to the thing... First, this is supposed to boost my player, but I have to turn the volume on the device way up to hear anything, which does't sound all that different from the usual player on it's own. Then, I tried to move around with this thing attached to my player in the only way that seemed possible, by AUX. That's when I discovered that the heaphone output does not make a good connection with any of three pairs I tried, some with adaptors, like the one from Grado. They included two Sennheiser's and one AKG. I could only sit with the thing in one position, or it would crackle, go on and off, or just plain fall out of the input. Portable? Not so much.  So,the one I got is a piece of junk. It looks nice, but take your chances...  Now I looked for info. on returning the thing, which I did not buy here (unfortunately, probably). Can only return it for repairs...    Update: 9-29-14  Reply to Posting by another user -     I connect this device to various mp3 players. And, I connect this device to the player's headphone output, then connect the headphones or my car system to the headphone out on the device. At least, that's what I think I'm doing... Anyway, it usually is able to smooth out whatever mp3 device I'm using, esp. if there's any harshness from the sound of the device in use. It just seems to make mp3s sound better. I guess I should have come back to update my 2012 review (I'd forgotten all about it). So, mostly, I find the FiiO device to be quite useful, and to improve mp3s. However, my continuing frustration with this thing is that I have never been able to access any sub-menus. I would like to switch it to 96/24, but cannot seem to find a way to do it. Otherwise, my opinion of this is far more positive than what I put in the old review.   That's my tale of woe.

B002XTXFU8|4.0|i,v been a fan of tom hardy ever since i saw him in a 4 part episode called 'the take'. then i saw him in inception and many others. i must say thAT he has such a way with roles in all his projects that he makes them memorable. him as 'bronson' was so unbelievable!!! wow what a performance. at 1st i didnt relize it was tom hardy under all that muscle and madness. this movie is not for evryone though. if u can take it, u shuld see it, or own it. this movie is full of dark humor, art, madness, a gr8 score, and oh yes...more madness. not to mention the nudity that tom had 2 do. takes guts to do that in more then %50 of the film. this role must hav been dreadful to go through, but tom being the actor he is, he dives head first totally commited to his characters. he literally jumps out at u like a cartoon character, i couldnt help but laugh half the time. gr8 performance tom, cant wait to see u as bane and mad max next. tom hardy has really become my fav actor who's career i'll be following from now on!!
030758836X|5.0|Ms. Flynn clearly places her imprimatur as the head of the cognoscenti for the school of fiction known as \\"post-delightful\\" (Derrida would have been so proud). The type of fiction we have come to expect from all those sexy, intellectually vivacious KU grads (ok...maybe not all of them). Reading Murakami on the beach and drinking PBR's- WHO KNEW... yes, Gone Girl is most delightful and beyond. And as for you haters posting the one or two stars, I believe I have spied you reviewing the works of Barry Soetoro and writing smitten reviews in the six or seven star range- blessed are you the true intellects among us.

B007O3QC8K|5.0|I think this is the best recording that Sir Simon has produced, of those of his that I have heard.<br /><br />It is of particular note that he has produced such a good recording with a piece that is so difficult and widely represented in the catalogue.<br /><br />On the first few occasions I played it, like every idiot listening to a new recording, I paid attention mostly to certain points in the score where I might find certain felicities I savour in other recordings either replicated or improved upon. But as I've listened more, I've come to appreciate the recording on its own terms and I think that it's captured a coherent pulse and appropriately emphasised key points in the score's large terrain. The balance is particularly good and the dynamics are effective (this is a notable achievement for both the BPO and the audio engineers working in the Philharmonie because both have mostly performed poorly on this front since the late 1970s).<br /><br />I love Giulini's VPO DG recording and Karajan's 1966 BPO recording, and Sir Simon's recording possesses several things I value in both those other accounts. He doesn't quite attain Karajan's pulsar-beam drive and concentration, preferring a more expansive and ruminative amble through the score. And he also doesn't quite attain the emphatic and incisive articulation that Giulini does. However, Rattle is able to get the Berliners to play at their full, while preserving the structural tension of the symphony, and his colouring is virtuosic.<br /><br />The fourth movement has passages which sound new and exciting, but few of them. Much of it sounds like Bruckner's Symphony 4 1/2. Obviously scholars have taken something that Bruckner had never felt befitting of performance and turned it into a performing edition. He never suggested people play this material, and therefore one can conclude that it isn't fit for performance - it simply doesn't formally represent late-Bruckner. It isn't finished and God knows what Bruckner wouldhave done to make it performable if he were to have been given another decade to work on it. It mostly sounds rudimentary and banal, which is what it really is - working material made performable by scholars. Imagine what any of the other symphonies would sound like if their much earlier contributing drafts were compiled and performed! Pretty crummy, that's for sure.<br /><br />I would still prefer to have it than not have it, and I think this performing edition should be widely adopted, no matter its limitations.

This tale is told as he recounts many important moments and events in his life to the historical scribe, Lord Verniers. He begins at the beginning... when his a father (for reasons unknown at the time) removes him from his home and deposits him at the doors of the Sixth Order. It is here he will start his new life in training to be a fighter/warrior of The Realm, governed by King Janus.<br />His feats become legendary, his name renowned and feared on two continents. Yet there is more to this man then just a skilled master of the blade, for he possesses a soul and a conscience... and it's this part of him that makes this story so extraordinarily good.<br /><br />&lt;end spoilers><br /><br />Some thoughts on \\"Raven's Shadow\\" Book One...<br /><br />1.) a terrific tale... a beautifully written and skillfully told story.<br /><br />2.) nicely paced... with a near perfect balance of action vs. drama.<br /><br />3.) well done character development. Not only of our main protagonist Vaelin, but also several of his 'brothers' of the sixth order.<br /><br />4.) a hero to root for. The type of character that most fantasy readers who like tales of knights, castles and medieval battles and intrigue will probably be drawn to.<br />Traits that develop on a gradual level as he goes from a young boy into manhood. He's an extremely deft fighter with his sword. a natural leader of men and is conscientiously fair when making decisions (even evolving his enemies)... and yet he does not give of an invincible superhero aura. He appears to be just 'another' one of the boys.<br /><br />The closest character I can relate Vaelin to, would be author Joe Abercrombie's Logen Ninefingers from the \\"The First Law\\" trilogy. Those readers who have read Abercrombie's trilogy and liked it, will likely really enjoy this tale.<br /><br />5.) an element of mystery-thriller to some of the side stories. Some surprise developments in the latter stages that ensure a follow up book.<br /><br />6.) maps... three maps that give the basic geographical layout.

0446693804|4.0|I have always been a fan of Nicholas Sparks' work, and this one is no different. Some people might not think it's a realistic story, but I don't agree. I think that the power of someone just being a genuine, nice, person who radiates kindness, etc really can affect someone else, even if it doesn't show at first.<br /><br />I watched the movie too, and I can't say I like either one better than the other, but Nicholas definitely does a good job telling a story that doesn't always have a happy ending, and yet doesn't make you feel completely depressed and unhappy that you read the book.<br /><br />If you are a fan of his previous books (or any after this one), I'm sure that you'll find this one enjoyable as well
0061777269|5.0|Consciousness Beyond Life: The science of the near-death experience by Pim van Lommel, M.D., HarperCollins, 2010, 466 ff.<br /><br />Dr van Lommel is a Dutch scientist and physician who worked as a cardiologist in Holland from 1977 to 2003. In 2001, he published in the medical journal `The Lancet' a ground-breaking study on `Near-Death Experience in Survivors of Cardiac Arrest'. This book is the English translation of a book originally published in Dutch in 2007 on the same subject.<br /><br />There are now several books on the market (for example, those by Sabom, Fenwick, Fox) dealing with NDEs and the closely related OBEs. Most of these present anecdotal accounts of visions from patients who undergo some medical trauma (often heart attacks or cardiac surgery). The stories are verifiable in that they agree with the known facts surrounding the event. Most of these books interpret NDEs as indicating connection with some extra-corporeal spiritual state. In some cases, this cosmic energy is regarded as divine. What can be stated with certainty is that NDEs and OBEs indicate an ability of the human mind to undergo experiences that are not explainable by traditional science.<br /><br />There are also books on NDEs by materialist scientists who dismiss any spiritual interpretation of these events and attempt to explain them purely in terms of human physiology (for example, Michael Marsh). Those authors, like Marsh, who attribute such events to a momentary hallucination in patients as they revive are clearly factually mistaken.<br /><br />Van Lommel's book is a convincing account of the study of over one hundred patients during more than twenty years practice who suffered cardiac arrest and were judged to be clinically dead (sometimes for five minutes or more) but who were resuscitated. This study therefore reaches the same conclusion as Michael Sabom, Peter and Elizabeth Fenwick, or Mark Fox. As van Lommel says here, these experiences `cannot be attributed to imagination, psychosis or oxygen deprivation.'<br /><br />NDEs may not prove the existence of God or the afterlife, but they certainly show that there is a dimension of the natural world that requires more than just materialist scientism to explain it. The book concludes with a 23-page Bibliography and a detailed Index.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1907661905 The Afterlife Revealed by Michael Tymn]]<br />[[ASIN:0062517392 Life After Life: The Investigation of a Phenomenon--Survival of Bodily Death by Raymond Moody<br />[[ASIN:0671464469 Recollections of Death: A Medical Investigation by Michael Sabom]]<br /><br />Howard Jones is the author of  The World as Spiritpsychosis or oxygen deprivation.'<br /><br />NDEs may not prove the existence of God or the afterlife, but they certainly show that there is a dimension of the natural world that requires more than just materialist scientism to explain it.

B0015AARJI|1.0|The controls are extremely stiff. I understand that there is a certain amount of time it takes to break things in, but this is awful. If your gaming requires you to be precise, pass this up. I haven't even had the controller for a month and the left thumbstick (L3) stopped working. Im mainly playing COD zombies and running is essential. Not having a working controller is kind've a downer. I had to switch back to my used gamestop controller, which has been working since the day I bought it. Also, another thing with this one, you cant leave it plugged in when you shut off your system or it will kep turning it back on. The rumble works and is great but shelling out $35.00 for a malfunctioning controller is not. Returned.

Amazon made it right with me and refunded my money , My order contained a size 12 and a size 13 shoe ,so not a &#34;pair&#34; .These are so hard to find ,I still have not found a set of size 13 like I wanted...
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved it! I love Fifty Shades and I am not saying that one is better than the other because the characters have different past lives but I am upset that I have to wait so long for the next book to be released. I wish they were released closer together but I recommend to anyone who loved Fifty Shades. Excellent read, could not put it down!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I LOVE THIS APP MY WORLD IS SO BIG YOU GUYS SHOULD VISIT IS YOU WOULD SEE HOW BIG IT IS AND IM ONLY ON LEVEL 22
B008FC4WA4|5.0|What I like about these Byliner publications is that you get what feels like a whole book in a short or shorter read. I've been following all this publisher's releases since I read the Krakauer story on that pretender philanthropist Mortenson. I don't really know Nick Hornby's work -- my daughters do. All I knew was that he's well loved out there, popular, and in this short story (which is what this is, by the way), he proves he's earned all his fans  -- he's a lively prose stylist, a terrific humorist with great comic timing, and a really fine observer of human failings, men's and women's. You get the whole breadth of this guy's life here: his failed marriage, his wife's large-scale assault on him in the press (what an exercise in humiliation!), how stuck he is in a job and a way of living, and how helpless he is against all of it, at the end of the day -- and the story is still funny. Highly recommended from this reader, new to Hornby. Plus, you'll feel a whole lot better about your marriage, I bet.
0385344228|1.0|One of the worst books I have read in a long time.  Should have waited to get it from the library but I bought it. No real reason for the book to have been written in my opinion.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|In parts a tad to steamy for me in somerimes. I do find the humor in her inner war she has with herself... we all have those.<br /><br />It is a fast easy read & very easy to get drawn into each character. I recommend this to anybody who likes a good steamy romance & of age!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|No thing complicated. It does everything you want in a basic desktop calculator.  The big keys are easy to and type.  The &quot;review&quot; window lets you double check your work.  PERFECT!
B0072GPQ72|5.0|This one will yank the tear drops. Joey the horse only wanted one thing...\\"to go home.\\" This is a war movie with a good ending.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is vary fun!  There are many things you can do in your village.  it is also easy to get coins and acorns without spending money.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Honestly... I don't keep my expectations high when purchasing a 5 star-review book. But WOW! Slammed deffinitelly had all the things I need in a book: solid and likeable characters, funny bits, sad and emotional moments as well. I even liked the Slam (I've really never been to much into poetry).<br />I read it in hours, and could not stop. It was well written, engaging. What else can I say? I am so going to read Point of Retreat!
B000ICPJOM|5.0|I've always loved the Stargate series and so far I'm relly enjoying this one. Love the stories and acting and etc etc etc etc. I wish we could have SG-1 in here but you can only have so much of what you want!
B007UXSDYU|4.0|I only rented this movie because it was $1 somewhere else, but much to my surprise I ended up liking it.<br /><br />Now, you are definitely not going to get any warm and fuzzy feelings while watching this film. Parts of it are dark and very sad, but it's not gory. Oh bad stuff does happen, but at least the movie does not show every gruesome detail. In fact, I'm not sure why this film is categorized as \\"horror.\\" Drama or sci-fi drama would be more fitting.<br /><br />There are a few twists and turns that I definitely did not expect, which made the plot interesting. While there are several holes in the story and I found myself wanting to wring the neck of a few of the characters, the film is not simply a remake of something we've seen before. It won't win any oscars, but it's a great psychological thriller. A sort of Lord of the Flies in the aftermath of an undefined attack that takes place in the basement apartment of a crazy building supervisor.<br /><br />The scenario makes for a pretty good flick.
0743298039|5.0|I haven't read this type of book probably since high school when I read Jane Eyre and Rebecca.  Lately I have been reading modern mysteries and, though it is also a mystery, this was a pleasant change of pace.  I loved the development of the characters.  I could see them easily in my mind's eye.  The plot had several parts to it and it all came together beautifully, but it was definitely not able to be figured out in advance.  I looked forward to getting away each day with this book and being taken to another time and another place.  Totally enjoyable!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I rarely purchase anything due to web-based reviews. I'm extremely happy I did so in this case.<br /><br />The Wool Omnibus Edition contains 5 short stories that tell the story of an underground human society. This is a post-apocalyptic society that lives in an underground city called the Silo. Through a series of inter-related characters, we are introduced to the mysteries of life in the Silo, and eventually, secrets that could upset their carefully balanced existence.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to more stories from this series.

B0086700CM|4.0|This game is terribly addicting. A total time killer. A little slow on getting on that band wagon but I've gotten tons of people addicted.
B004PGNB1K|5.0|This read was just plain enjoyable.It takes a special book to immerse  me in fantasy. Rothfuss has managed it twice in a row now. For the first time in a long time, my critical mind just turned off and I started looking at what was left of the book hoping it would go for longer. A guilty pleasure read.
B007V508CC|1.0|For the first time ever I am giving anything of Maroon 5 a 1 star.  I have been a massive fan since \\"Songs About Jane\\".  I have listened to that CD over 100 times (not even joking).  In my opinion it is considered to be the best album ever released.  Then came \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long.\\"  Great CD.  There was only 1 or 2 songs on that album that I didn't love. After that they released \\"Hands All Over.\\"  I have to admit, I wasn't instantly in love with this CD.  But after listening to each song 3-4 times, it grew on me.  And now I listen to it here and again.<br /><br />Then came the worst thing Maroon 5 has ever done.  I pre-ordered \\"Overexposed\\" thinking I would absolutely love this CD.  When Maroon 5 launched the hit \\"Payphone\\", I feel in love!  I listened to it on replay for an hour long and almost memorized all the lyrics.  Great song.  A few weeks later they released \\"One More Night.\\"  Again, another great song that I listened to 5-6 times.  Then I got the email telling me I could finally download the new CD.  I was so excited I downloaded it that instant!  I listened to the whole CD during a slow time at work.  Then I got home and listened to it again. The next day I listened to half of it on the way to work and half on the way back from work.  I decided to give it one more chance and just barely finished listening to it all the way through before writing this review.<br /><br />This has got to be the worst mistake Maroon 5 has ever made.  All but \\"Payphone\\" and \\"One More Night\\" are horrible songs.  This isn't an \\"OMG, no 'Songs About Jane' type CD?!?!\\"  This is an \\"OMG these songs are not at all catchy or good!\\"  I have a large taste in music ranging from Styx to Eminem to The Beatles to Garth Brooks.  I almost enjoy all types of music, depending what type of mood I am in.  But this album makes me want to turn it off.  I am so very disappointed in Maroon 5 and their decision to sell this album.  I wish I could say that I will grow to love it, but that probably won't happen since I have already listened to it 4 times and hate it just as much the last time as the first.<br /><br />Congrats, Maroon 5, on disappointing one of your biggest fans.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the perfect calculator. Simple and easy to use. Love seeing the calculations after the results. It's the best.

B007G5H2HQ|4.0|We never saw this movie but the kids love Shrek.  It was easy to watch through our PS3 and we will continue to watch movies on here.  It does cost more than Redbox but we don't have to worry about taking it back to the store to wait in line to find out the machine is down :)
0385342063|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  It was a quick, easy read and it was very entertaining.  The book had me laughing out loud throughout and I felt a connectional with Poppy, the main character.  Poppy is hilarious!  She is likable and had quirks that I could relate to doing myself.  It was fun to read this book and filled my desire and need to read.  If you like Sophie Kinsella's other titles, you will definitely like this one as well!
0307730697|4.0|For those who think life is hard and they can't do what they'd like to do or don't believe that they'll ever acccomplish anything, this book is for them. Even without a military background, everyone can appreciate the tenacity and intestinal fortitude that is exhibited. It would seem that a young man with his early failures would never achieve much of anything, but his belief in God and his tremendous will to succeed overcame almost insurmountable obstacles to reach his goal.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think the way it explains how to do it is very helpful. Also the technology is very intricate.  . . that can be very helpful!! This game is addictive and fun!!!!!!!
B000XR4OC0|4.0|I've wanted Toms for a long time and finally broke down and bought a pair. I normally wear a size ten and after doing some research decided I would order my normal size. The fit perfect with socks on but a little lose with bare feet. I will probably get my next pair half a size down. Overall love the casual look of the shoe and they are much more comfortable than expected. I would definitely recommend and I will be buying more.
B0086700CM|1.0|i hate it nothing comes up at leaast it was free waste of time downloading this application their is no use ive tried several times
B002ZG981E|5.0|What a fantastic movie.  Christopher Nolan's direction is right on, and the cast is lead well by Leonardo Dicaprio.  Reminded me a little of the Matrix, but different and better.
B006LSZECO|5.0|LOVED this book!  Had crazy dreams from it.<br />I thought Flynn did an exceptional job developing the characters. Dysfunction on so many very true levels!  There were a couple flaws that really stood out to me regarding a police investigation that seemed pretty basic even for the inept team put on the case.  However, that in no way took away from this great novel.<br />I'm totally hooked on Flynn. Going to read the other novels and keep pandering for more from her!!
B004EPZ06Q|3.0|I definitely laughed much and enjoyed this movie, but it was a letdown in comparison to the first movie.  Same great characters, but too much of the same.  Not enough creativity in this one. Worth watching, but not owning.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This was a very complex story with a little bit of everything & all the while keeping the reader in suspense.  Great read!
B005AUWY90|4.0|My kids love it, and I enjoyed it as well, but it was a letdown from the first Cars movie.  The storyline is a little too advanced for young kids, but they still enjoy the movie as well as all the Mater jokes.
B00003CXB4|5.0|received it on time and the product is just like new with very good packing would buy the product again
B00004CY38|2.0|ludicrous and not funny. . .<br /><br />The leading characters are very attractive in looks, but the Cinderella story (with comedy scenes like Shaw's Pygmalion) is predictable and totally preposterous without being really entertaining.<br /><br />Not worth the trouble.
B003KHJJNE|5.0|I enjoy Sony's Original Jacket Collection sets, and own several. This entry, devoted to the work of Pablo Casals, is one of the finest in the series. The production values of the set are outstanding, with a collection of 10 cds, each replicating the cover of an LP as originally issued.<br /><br />Although the oldest of these recordings dates from 1950 at the Prades Festival, the sound on these cds is remarkable. Casals was a masterful cellist, and these recordings demonstrate why. The recordings feature some of the standard repertoire for cello, including pieces by Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Schubert, Mendelssohn, and Haydn. A wonderful bargain at full price, and an astonishing deal at the discounted rate currently available.
B00479SVBU|5.0|This little unit is just what we have been looking for.  It was easy to get set up and continues to work above our expectations! We highly recommend this product.  Very reasonably priced as well!  Thank you !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|The game constantly wants me to connect to Facebook. Connecting to Facebook is not mandatory, which is the only reason I've kept the game, but that screen always popping up is annoying. I wish there was an option to turn that off.<br />The graphics in the game are outstanding, and the game is fun. I def recommend.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I've really enjoyed these puzzles over the past couple of months.  When I tried them through the Internet and facebook, they were not nearly as enjoyable as this, since the solutions weren't actual pictures, which is tbh a rewarding feature!<br /><br />I'be had a problem with puzzle 5.3.  After restarting three times, I've had consistent contradictions in the upper left area.  I'm somewhat positive that there is an error, and would like to check with someone.  Wondering if there is a way to contact the developer about it?
0143123173|5.0|I had not heard of these books until the TV version. I Was captivated by Robert Taylor's presentation of the character and wanted more. I found the first novel a slow start but gave it a chance and was captivated but the building of relationships  and the growing revelation of character in the stories. I am through the first four and am simply taking a break because I devoured them in less that a week. I only wish that the writer's of the tv show had been more true to the other character's in the novels. These are great reads!
B0058VW36U|3.0|it was fun for a few days then it kinds gets boring after a while. so ya but its my opinion but your opinion might be fifteenth. MY OPINION JUST A WORNING!!!!
0375842209|5.0|This is a book that is special from start to finish and remains firmly in my memory years after first reading it.  I've read many books since but this remains at the top of my favourites list.  Its interesting how many of my closest friends loved it too.  Sensitive, haunting and perfectly original.  Thanks for telling this story.
B0051MKNV8|4.0|This film is a nice change of pace, something different than the norm. A man takes a magic pill and transforms into a genius but not without consequences and one big sht storm. The acting was good, story good and unique, direction good, vibrant colors, cinematography good, dialog really good. Overall 4-1/2 Stars. I will always tell it like I see it.<br />Scott M
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game its so addicting i play it on my kindle and my cellphone ha even when I'm talking on my phone
B004EPYZP8|4.0|This movie was pretty good considering there has been plenty of movies made of somewhat the same type storyline. This one however has enough twists and surprises to keep your serious attention, the acting was good the direction good story.good overall a solid 4 star film. I will always tell it like I see it.<br />Scott M
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|After I downloaded this, I couldn't stop playing! It is so addicting!! I keep going so I can see what the next level holds for me; how many pigs, & birds; what type of birds I get to use to destroy the pigs, & what kind of \\"hiding place\\" the pigs built for themselves. Give it a try......pretty good for \\"free\\". Thank you, Amazon!!
1400031524|2.0|I really enjoyed Mr Mankell's \\"Faceless Killers.\\" He was obviously writing about a part of the world he was familiar with. I enjoyed the specific details he provided. It was gritty, unpolished and a good read. Wallander was painted effectively as a flawed hero. However, in \\"Dogs of Riga,\\" Mankell moves the storyline to Latvia where he does not appear to have the same familiarity. He retreats from providing details in the story to the point of cliche. His description of Latvia could be one of 15 different countries. After reading the book, I don't feel that I have any greater understanding or knowledge of the country or the culture. Also, I had a very difficult time suspending reality sufficiently enough to finish the book. Supposedly Wallander becomes Major Liepa's most important confidant in the world after a few days together with virtually no conversation. Really?! Then the resistance in Latvia puts the fate of their movement in Wallander's hands. Essentially a small town policeman from another country that knows nothing about their country, culture or struggle. Really?! Then Wallander risks his life because he falls in love with someone he has met once, knows very little about and can barely talk to. Really?! The \\"conflict\\" between protagonist and antagonist is trite and sophomoric. When he announces the obvious suspect is guilty, the story does not provide any information to support this announcement. We know it just because the author tells us who is guilty.  Then the simplistic plot twist tells us he really isn't guilty. Once again, the story provides no support for this change, other than the author telling us he's innocent. This plot reads like a high school creative writing project. It is silly and not the same caliber as Faceless Killers.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very relaxing. and fun....I hope they add more stuff...great movie short too : D awesome for downtime...characters are so cute
0143037757|5.0|This is a comprehensive, well written study of the transformation of Europe -- both East and West -- after World War II.  Judt points out how stunted Europe's growth was by the thirty years war of 1914-45, and how West Europe finally joined the twentieth century in the great boom period of the 1950s to 1960s.<br /><br />Despite a few lingering illusions -- quickly dispelled in Vietnam, India, Algeria, Africa, and the Suez -- Europe finally shed its imperial ambitions and came to terms with its reduced role in a world dominated by the U.S., U.S.S.R., and China.  The great struggle for Europe was whether it would offer a \\"third way\\" alternative to communism and captialism.  Judt concludes that the socialist ideology dominated west as well as east in the postwar period, but that ultimately a socialist state that cured the perversions of Stalinist communism while avoiding the predations of American capitalism was rejected.  There really is no \\"third way\\" offered by Europe, though Europeans tend to reject what they perceive to be out-of-control individualism and violence of Americans.  The European alternative that emerges at the conclusion of the century is essentially the American system tempered by a larger social safety net and higher taxes.<br /><br />Although Judt takes pride in Europe as the model society, he concedes that the \\"European\\" ideal is fuzzy at best.  What exactly is it other than warmed over American capitalism (and tepid Christianity in a society far more secular than the U.S.), and will even the \\"welfare state\\" programs that distinguish Europe (already being cut back, particularly in Britain) survive the 21st century?  One wonders whether the failure to articulate a true \\"third way\\" will ultimately push Europe into looking more and more like the U.S. as the century progresses.<br /><br />In the end what really defines Europe is a commitment to reject war, imperialism, and genocide as instruments of state policy.  The economic interdependence of the European states does seem to make war completely obsolete, so that has been a great success story.<br /><br />Judt points out that the traumas of World War II left the individual nation states racially homogenous.  This has led to some stability as these homogenous states were free of internal tensions and were self governing, while the rejection of the horrors of conflict caused these different ethnicities and peoples to cooperate to promote peace on the continent.  However, the racial diversity created by guest workers and increasing movements of peoples over borders may test this system, and Europe may yet face the race problems that have plagued American history for the past 400 years.<br /><br />Judt portrays the East as suffering a remarkable stunting of economic growth by virtue of the deficiences of the Soviet system.  The cost of integrating East with West has been staggering, particularly in Germany.  Whether there will be lingering East/West tensions that will tear Europe apart is not a question sufficiently developed by Judt.<br /><br />There is an irritating tendency to portray the U.S. and U.S.S.R. as morally equivalent so far as Europe is concerned.  In the European mind, each superpower was an overbearing master who held Europe back.  This is unfair to the U.S., as conceded by Judt who is highly complimentary of the Marshall Plan and the boom times brought on by more enlightened American policies.  But the resentment felt for the U.S. is a defining European characterisitic, as is the revulsion felt for the high crime rate, predatory capitalism, materialism, deficient social safety net, and religious evangelicalism that Europeans see when they look at the U.S.  Ironically, the Europeans really have not articulated a distinct system, and perhaps what really repels them is that they are so much like the U.S. and have adopted the American approach is so many ways.<br /><br />This is a excellent and comprehensive survey and an attempt to start to put the postwar period into some historical perspective now that over 60 years has passed.

B007JRU2UK|5.0|Set in beautiful Hawaii and starring George Clooney, I can't imagine finding anything wrong with this film.  The story line was good, George Clooney played an excellent role and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  If nothing else, it would be worth it just for all the close-ups of George Clooney -- a true Hollywood leading man!!
B005LAIGZU|5.0|This movie is up there in the same class of \\"saving private ryan\\".  Make sure you watch<br />it in a good player and stereo system so you can hear all the awesome battle scenes.<br />I give it a five-star rating no doubt.  Gave me a feeling that people give their lives away so you and i can<br />sit home enjoy our family and freedom.  Two thumbs up!  Let the rest of world know that we<br />as Americans are not too be messed with!  We will kill u three times before you even know we<br />are there!
B007I1Q4W2|4.0|With a tiny budget, there's no way to get top acting talent or whiz-bang CGI effects, and the \\"making of\\" special feature underscores how shoe-stringy \\"Exit\\" really was to make.  The low budget shows.  Most of the acting is at best serviceable, and at worst makes the opposite but equally annoying mistakes of being too wooden or too hammy.  Plus, the drawls and accents seemed to slide all over the place.<br /><br />But those limitations aside, \\"Exit\\" gets the \\"for-free\\" stuff mostly right--by which I mean creativity, dedication, enthusiasm, storytelling, originality...the vision part that one either brings to a film or not, and that cannot be bought at any price (I give you \\"Battleship,\\" a thin but expensive reworking of \\"Transformer\\" tropes).  For filmmakers who actually care about their creations, this stuff can be gotten for free and elevate zero-budget movies to remarkable entertainments (I give you [[ASIN:B00001QGUM The Blair Witch Project]], [[ASIN:078401213X Pi]], [[ASIN:B004HY88BI Open Water]], and [[ASIN:B0007N1JC8 Primer]]). All that's required is a love of film and willingness to go a little gonzo.<br /><br />\\"Exit\\" goes a little gonzo.<br /><br />Much of the movie actually is relatively familiar fare, but the setting (postbellum America), the characterizations, the backstories (especially how this zombie plague got rolling in the first place), the use of animation and flashbacks--it all adds up to a unique zombie movie experience. And that counts with me.  I've always loved the zombie sub-genre, and I have been encouraged in recent years to see just how far it can be stretched.  The walking dead have a lot to teach us about bigotry, isolation, consumerism, class warfare, courage, grief, mortality...yeah, the first job of any good zombie movie is to scare you and maybe gross you out, but beyond that, the best ones have something to say.<br /><br />I'm not sure ExACTLY what \\"Exit Humanity\\" was trying to say, but the IMPRESSION it left was of a man who, through incalcuable loss, had joined the dead figuratively (and wished to join them literally) and was brought back to vitality through meaningful projects, human relationships, and natural beauty.  I would say that while the movie was too long by 20 percent and could have dropped a subplot or two, tightening up its storyline to good effect, my patience through the pointless or slow parts was rewarded by a few tense scenes, some tasty revenge, and a satisfying conclusion.  Few low-budget sub-genre movies can boast more than that. I can't recommend \\"Exit\\" in the same breath as [[ASIN:B0044BY9N0 Autumn]] or [[ASIN:B0078YWU6I The Dead]], but at least \\"Exit\\" ASPIRES.
B000V6I7WG|5.0|Oh Dae-su was your typical average person until he got jumped by someone and taken to a private prison for 15 years. His prison is basically like a rundown apartment complete with bathroom, a bed and a TV as one of his only link to the outside world besides talking to the jailer, he gets fed 3 times a day including with water and would sometimes get a haircut but during those years he builds up so when the time comes he can take care of someone his own way. Now in 2003 after 15 years he is finally free out on the streets of Seoul as he is given new clothes, cash and a cellphone. He sees the city has changed over the years, he finds romance with a Japanese chef named Mido and now must find the crooks who tormented him and imprisoned him for those years.<br /><br />A most excellent crime thriller and one of the best comic based movies ever. From Korean director Park Chanwook, this movie is loosely based on a popular Japanese manga or Japanese comic book, this movie is a poetic and very violent revenge movie about what it feels to be aged and being away from the world for a long time. There's a Taratino-esque quality to it that he even approve of this movie as being one of his favorite movies ever and now it has became a cult classic that even thrilled critics. This movie is brutally violent at times with a couple of torture scenes like the cringe inducing dental job with a hammer-back scene to good acting. This complex work of art is one that entertains and thrills the viewer to the edge of their seats to the mind blowing ending.<br /><br />The blu-ray has a nice transfer with good sound with great extras like 3 commentaries in subtitles with your choice of Korean with english subs or English dubbing. Trailers, deleted scenes with optional commentary and a second disc with 5 documentaries, interviews and featurettes.<br /><br />A must have for fans of crime, action, comic book movies and cinema alike.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Beautiful Disaster... Truely a fitting name for the story between Abby and Travis..<br /><br />This is a story about a girl running from her past. And like in real life you can only run so far before you are forced to deal with your deamons. For Abby this happens when her life becomes intertwined with Travis. Travis is no walk in the park. He is a ladies man with a temper.<br /><br />This is not your typical love story.<br /><br />This is a story about love, heart ache, disfunction, trails, hope, redemption, and moving on.<br /><br />Truely a great read..

0800141660|5.0|I am so ashamed to say I picked this movie up from the $5 bin at Walmart. A-MA-ZING. I am a huge Jane Austen fan but have never liked the book Sense and Sensibility. Then I saw this movie...Emma Thompson did such an amazing job as writer and actress. ***SPOILER ALERT*** When she broke down and cried at the end oh my goodness. I wish her and Lee could adapt all of Austen's work. BRILLIANT.
B005S9EJ14|1.0|Saw this at the movies after reading much \\"laurel throwing\\" at the wonderful acting, etc. -- this movie<br />was awful!!!  A depressing chain of events without much happiness and too much drama!!
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book was such a rollercoaster ride and created so much tension in me that I had to put it down for a week! After those few days the suspense was killing me, so much so that I gave up and peaked at some of the last chapters to calm my nerves. That's how good this is written! I did not look at the actual ending, just a few pages in one of the last chapters and that was enough to get me back into it. I loved it until the ending. It was so anti-climatic, such a break from the rhythm of the rest of the book that I thought I got a defective download to my Kindle. I wished that I had read the reviews before I bought it. I will from now on, that's for sure! I don't recommend this book. Unless you like being hung out to dry. It was that bad of an ending. What a let down.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this is so awesome this is my favorite game in the whole wide world that is why I got it
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome. and anyone who says it isn't , then your crazycand need help. some people say it's touchy, but that's just because they suck at it and they just wanna say bad things about the game and that means they are a half empty type of person. you should so tat this game. it is so cool.best game I have ever played in my life.

B004SJ3BCI|3.0|for a while this game was in. but now, I hardly ever play it cause it gets boring after a while. but also, anyone who says it is terrible, it's just because they sick at it and can't get the hang of it. and they say that it has to many adds, I have no idea what their talking about. mine doesn't have any adds. their just jelous that they can't get the hang of it and want to say bad things about it
B0063IH60K|5.0|great way to keep from being bored. keeps my mind working and active exercise also helps the mind. I just love solitaire.

B005CX53RU|5.0|Although it took a while to receive it, it was a great battery. I would use this company again. Thanks
B006ZNRD06|5.0|I spent maybe 2 days looking for a proper tablet app to play mp4 applications that didn't flake out on my Xoom.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|This game is a gr8 game love it has me wanting 2 stay on 4 hrs. The game is worth play'n.
1466401885|5.0|This was a great love story. In some ways, it reminded me of 50 Shades, but even better and without the s&m! This book could have used a better proofer. There were some spacing and spelling errors. Even so, I really enjoyed this one. I could'nt put it down! I will look for more novels by this author.
B0086700CM|5.0|Omg they finally come up with it on the kindle fire!  its such a good game you'll love it!  You should get it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A friend told me I might enjoy the Fifty Shades Trilogy.  I really did.  Great read and hard to put down.  I finished all three books in about a week!
B005ZUR724|5.0|I got this game about 6 months ago and it is a very good game. The only problem is that you have to pay monthly after 6 months to keep playing but it only costs a dollar. overall one of the best games I have played.
0345536886|4.0|I had a difficult time getting into some books lately. One book was worse than the last. Finally, I started to read The Litigators and so glad I did. I really liked David Zinc's character. I was rooting for him all the way. I don't want to give anything away but some parts were not believeable. This book opened my eyes to large companies with all the money to hire the best lawyers and as many as they want.<br /><br />I thought most of Finley & Figg was believeable and laughable. I would suggest this book.
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|Like may reviewers, I feel the need to preface this by saying, yes, yes a million times, I LOVED \\"Band of Brothers.\\"  BOB is a high water mark, a Holy Grail in WW2 films/TV shows.  \\"The Pacific,\\" on the other hand, is not.  Though not a total low point, it's close enough to earn a 1 star.  Major problems are many, including the bad writing.  It's weak.  Very little effort was made to interject actual 1940s era words, phrases and slang, and likewise there is a serious lack of \\"military speak.\\"  I served in the armed forces and, trust me, guys in the services are talking military lingo constantly.  So the dialog came off as unauthentic much of the time.  Likewise, the writers failed to create captivating characters.  Much to my dismay, I found the three lead characters--Robert Leckie, John Basilone and Eugene Sledge--all extremely boring to watch for nearly 7 hours.  Leckie and Sledge come across as morose, sullen and depressed most of the time.  Maybe that's what war does to most men, but it was boring as hell to watch.  Too much of the story also takes place in boring locales--stateside, Australia, a psych ward--wasting time and deflating the excitement built up when the men are actually at war.  The acting also seemed sub-par and lifeless, which didn't help bring any spark to the already flatly written characters.  And Jon Seda seems miscast as the legendary real-life Marine hero John Basilone.  Seda bares little resemblance to the actual Basilone and I just didn't buy Seda as this legendarily tough Marine.  There was also too much sex and nudity, which seemed extremely out of place in this series.  And FAR too many displays of stomach-turning blood, guts and gore.  At times it felt like I was watching a grotesque horror movie.  There was absolutely no need to continually wallow in scene after scenes of rotting and decaying Japanese corpses.  The action/war scenes are okay, but far too little to late to elevate this series marred by extremely poor writing, bad acting and questionable producing choices that fails to even come remotely close to the high standard set by Band of Brothers.  Major thumbs down on \\"The Pacific.\\"
B007UXSPK2|4.0|well tom cruise is at it again folks. the scenery and fight scenes were spot on in this movie. the plot was your typical everyone against the good guys and the bad guys were chasing them. did i mention how good the fight scenes were?? yeah they was the that imho. have a fun watching this action packed movie.
B003Y5HWJU|3.0|Most shows I either love or I hate, such as I loved \\"Band of Brothers\\" and I hated \\"The Pacific.\\"  But season 1 of \\"Boardwalk Empire\\" is SUCH a mixed bag of the good, the bad and the ugly that I truly can't love it or hate it.  It's so middle of the road that all I can say is I think I sort of like it... a little bit... kind of.  There's no doubt the \\"concept\\" is a good one--a show about the lives of a disparate group of people whose lives are linked together by crime, politics and personal dramas in the \\"Roaring 20s.\\"  It's a fascinating time that is ripe for the same HBO-ization storytelling that The Box did so well with in Rome, Deadwood and The Sopranos.  But make no mistake, Boardwalk is nowhere near a good as those three outstanding shows.  There are many problems, the first problem being the writing.  It's weak.  The writers created no great characters is Boardwalk, most of the characters are marginally interesting at best.  The main character,\\"Nucky\\" Thompson, is the greedy, self-serving \\"boss\\" of Atlantic City.  He has no inner-conflict.  He just wants money, sex and power and that's it.  He has it at the start of the season and he has it at the end.  There's no character arc, no character growth, no great dramas or threats for him to contend with.  And thus, he's kind of one-note and boring.  Jimmy, his sort of young protégé, is a sullen WWI veteran looking to, I guess, make a name for himself or make big money.  Jimmy's desires and goals are never made clear regarding his ambitions or his intentions with his young wife and son.  He just sort of falls into a life of crime and you never really get to know him or grown to like him.  He's just this sullen, angry young man with no clear goals in life.  Margaret is the lead female in the show and she's also a seemingly ruddlerless character.  A seemingly good young Irish Catholic wife/mother/widow who, at the drop of a hat, becomes a \\"kept woman\\" (which seems way out of character for her on the show).  Besides weak characters, the dialog is also weak, with far too few attempts to use words, phrases and slang common in the 1920s.  Most of the characters talk just like people in the 2000s, so there's no sense of authenticity to the dialog and characters.  This lack of authenticity problem is also present in the set design.  Yes, the sets look beautiful, but maybe too beautiful, too clean, too perfect, because somehow the show's \\"look\\" comes off as too stage-y.  In Deadwood the sets looked real; here they look fake.  The acting is all over the place.  Buscemi (who I generally like) seems miscast in the lead role of Nucky; he lacks the presence, menace and power of his acting \\"counterparts\\" in The Sopranos and Deadwood.  Michael Pitt displays zero range as Jimmy, playing him boring and sullen throughout the entire season.  Kelly Macdonald lends authenticity to her character with her natural Irish accent and spot-on sense of good-girl properness, but the poor writing gives her nowhere to go with her character and she gets boring as the season drags on.  Michael K. Williams, who was SO awesome in \\"The Wire,\\" is absolutely horrible as Chalky White, the \\"boss\\" of the Negro community in A.C.  He makes zero effort to give his character any sense of being a Negro in the 1920s and completely comes off as a modern day African-American person in speech, mannerisms, body language.  His acting is by far the worst on the show.  Surprisingly, the best acting comes from a few of the supporting actors, like Paz de la Huerta, Jack Huston, Gretchen Mol, Emily Meade and Anatol Yusef.  Also the actor who plays Charlie Sheridan, the Irish Crime Boss of Northern Chicago, and the child actress (Lucy Gallina) who plays Margaret's daughter--both of them were outstanding. So overall I give the concept an A, the writing a D, the set designs and costumes a C, the acting a B- (though there are few minor A performances).  I'll also grade the opening credit sequence; I'll give it an F.  The concept, music, style and cinematography of this opening credit sequence are wretchedly bad.  But overall the actual show's not bad-bad, it's okay.  I'll watch season 2 and hope they crank up the drama (especially between the Feds and bootleggers), and give the characters (and actors) clearly defined purposes, goals and major conflicts to contend with.  So give it a shot, but just don't go in to it expecting Sopranos, Rome or Deadwood levels of greatness.
B0073PZIYI|3.0|well justin timberlake is trying his hand at being an action star. while the concept of the film is different his acting was stiff in the movie. it had good cgi and the plot was middle of the road. the ending was one that was less than to be desired. but, it amazon had it for .99 cents so you couldn't beat it.
B001EC3JME|5.0|If you've purchased your Redline from Amazon...get this holster!  Its very secure.  The belt clip has a \\"hook\\" on the underside so it doesn't slide off your belt when pulling the torch out.  The swivel is a nice touch for when you're sitting down or driving.  Highly recommended :)
B007PS0X0W|4.0|this was an alright movie. it had the same stuff in it as the rest of the previous movies. you had the expected vampire werewolf fights. the plot of week but, the action scenes were pretty good. if you have nothing else to do on a rainy day then watch it.
B00000HZTB|3.0|this album has some really great moments: the title track, average guy, underneath the bottle, the heroine, the day john kennedy died, and waves of fear (the guitarwork is so intense it sounds like your stereo is melting!)but there are some boring turds on here too: my house, heavenly arms, and the track 'women' is so-so. i love the line \\"i used to look at women in the magazines. i know it sounds sexist, but i was only in my teens\\" only lou reed can turn a phrase like that.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|best game played fun and addicting good. time passer and an exiting alternitive to the boring city games that everyone plays
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I'm not a prude, but I did get tired of the main character being in \\"heat\\", for the entirety of the book.  After a while the sex scenes became somewhat tiresome.  The book was not well written.  The unrelenting repetition of \\" his long fingers\\", \\"he cocked  his head\\", etc. demonstrated the writer's lack of literary skills and creativity.  A friend told me that the second book is better, but I will not be wasting my time.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I stumbled across this little gem looking for something new after finishing Snow Crash, and it is a fantastic book. The characters are engaging, the world relatable and the writing style enjoyable. The story grabs you quickly and doesn't let go. If you're an '80s kid you'll love the nostalgia factor as well! Definitely worth the purchase.
B004GTLFNW|5.0|Loved this book! He starts out with some biographical information that gives you an idea of his background and philosophy on staying physically fit. There are so many exercises outlined here with detailed instructions and step by step photographs. You can do them all without special equipment in your own home. There are also many variations on how to make the moves more intense as you progress. He also suggests some ways to combine the exercises into routines in the latter part of the book. Highly recommended!
0984183523|5.0|Great book, defintely a great coach for folks aspiring to step into Management Consulting. Victor takes the reader step by step into preparing the mind-set for case interviews.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have NEVER experienced lag with this game on my kindle fire. I understand that most of the five stars were developer reviews, but this is not. This is a fun time waster. Anyone who says different is crazy or has never played temple run.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The game itself is a lot of fun. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the annoying popups. I know it's a free game and ads are necessary but video ads that you can't close everytime you shuffle are a bit much. Still love the game though!
B005LAII1C|5.0|When you grow up with a woman who makes teddy bears by hand and sells them for a living, they kind of become that extra member of the family. As a child, there were times when the bears would be in positions or places that weren't where they were thought to have been left. Our theory was that whenever we weren't around, whether it was if we left the house or went to bed or whatever, the bears would get up and throw parties when we weren't around. So any movie that features something like a living teddy bear that can talk probably resonates a bit more on this end than for the average person.<br /><br />\\"Ted\\" pretty much already had that nostalgic factor to it with the concept alone. While Seth MacFarlane doesn't always hit it out of the park with each episode of \\"Family Guy,\\" \\"American Dad,\\" or \\"The Cleveland Show,\\" when he does get it right it's something special; it's hilarious, it's emotional, and its references are spot-on. \\"Ted\\" is MacFarlane at his best. The trademarks he's known for are all in there whether it's the incredible music that is heavily Frank Sinatra inspired, the ridiculous movie and pop culture references, or the humor that always seems to take a flying leap over whatever the accepted standard might be; it's all in the stuffing/inner workings of \\"Ted.\\" The only difference is this is a different medium; a different plane for MacFarlane to bring his offbeat humor and influences into.<br /><br />The spin MacFarlane puts on a familiar story is what makes everything so good. Of course, hearing Patrick Stewart as the narrator is a pretty great way to start any movie. There are a few surprises in \\"Ted\\" that are worth keeping that way. There's this huge emphasis on \\"Flash Gordon\\" that results in some really memorable sequences.<br /><br />By now, you've probably heard the thunder song that John and Ted sing whenever a thunderstorm hits. It's still funny no matter how many times you hear it. Giovanni Ribisi was the best part of last year's \\"The Rum Diary\\" and he always seems to show up when you least expect him to like in \\"Avatar\\" or \\"Public Enemies.\\" He has the most hilarious sequence he's ever been a part of in \\"Ted.\\" It'll be difficult not to think of this particular scene whenever you see him from now on.<br /><br />\\"Ted\\" is an R-rated comedy first and foremost, but it also crams a lot of heart into its 106-minute run time. The strain that's put on both the relationship between John and Ted and John and Lori's relationship results in the last twenty or so minutes of the movie being purely emotional. So while you'll more than likely remember the movie for the farting scene at the restaurant, the dirty fozzy scene at the grocery store, or the most amazing hotel room brawl involving a teddy bear that you've ever seen, \\"Ted\\" is secretly setting you up for that tight feeling in your chest when that pull string on your heart is tugged a little too hard.<br /><br />\\"Ted\\" is the best thing Mark Wahlberg has been a part of since \\"The Fighter.\\" It also gives the impression that Seth MacFarlane is still in the upswing of his prime and still has a lot to offer to anyone who's a fan of comedy in general. With its magnificently rich score, flawless use of CG, heartfelt sucker punch neatly tucked away at its core, and endless barrage of references and foul mouthed and vulgar humor, \\"Ted\\" gives \\"21 Jump Street\\" a run for the funniest R-rated comedy of the year. In fact, it may even get your vote as the best comedy of the year. It's like 2012's secret weapon for comedy at least until we can get our hands on an Apache helicopter.and he always seems to show up when you least expect him to like in \\"Avatar\\" or \\"Public Enemies.\\" He has the most hilarious sequence he's ever been a part of in \\"Ted.\\" It'll be difficult not to think of this particular scene whenever you see him from now on.<br /><br />\\"Ted\\" is an R-rated comedy first and foremost, but it also crams a lot of heart into its 106-minute run time.

B0063IH60K|3.0|This app is very basic and the ads are annoying. But it is one of the free ones. I guess we pay one way or another!!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I love this app. some of the down falls are: if you create a random game you don't know where the heck the person lives. like I have a game with someone that lives in China. and we have a issue with that. I am asleep when she is awake. and the opposite.like I live in mass. and you can't get the updatted one on the kindle fire. it should pare you up with someone that lives closer to you. so for all you people in mass. here is my username. GT1ST blank. have to guess the last one. hint its a number. so I hope all of you envoy dtawsomething as much as me. I hope they come out with the update for kindle fires soon. peace out.
B002ZG999U|5.0|Good price and the vendor was very quick on the delivery.  I would buy from them again.  Love the movie, a guy movie to see with the guys smoke a cigar and drink some scotch .... great movies for a guys get together!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome and addicting. it is a good time killer. it does have a few minor glitches but they are small.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is free and it has some fun ways to pass the time. u have to play a bit in order to unlock all the games- but it keeps you interested.
B0086QS7N2|4.0|I became a fan in the summer of '79. They were my favorite band for over 20 years and are still at #2. (Love me some Spock's Beard!) I haven't loved every song they've done. Some albums still resonate more than others. That's just my personal taste. But I have really dug at least something from every period. And that's why I love this cd so much. There are songs & parts of songs that recall just about every style of writing they've ever done, and plenty of new territory as well. Track 1 would be right at home on 'Counterparts' or 'Test for Echo'. Track 2 alternates HEAVY 'Counterparts' with 'Grace Under Pressure' territory. Track 3, the title track, feels to me like their most epic rocker since 'Hemispheres'. Track 4 recalls 'Presto'. Track 5 starts as some of their heaviest stuff ever,  then goes into something reminiscent of 'Power Windows', then back & forth. Then there's track 6, \\"The Halo Effect\\", in which Rush nails the power ballad to the wall! My only wish is this one was longer, but I can always hit repeat. Track 7 is back to the heavier side of 'Counterparts'. Track 8 in parts feels like 'Roll the Bones' and also a little 'Presto'. Track 9, \\"Headlong Flight\\" takes me back to my Senior year of high school and 'Signals'. Track 10 is basically 1:27 worth of Geddy with a string section! Nice. Track 11 goes back to 'Roll the Bones'. And then the final track is so beautiful. A memorable vocal hook sung beautifully, beautiful arpeggios from Alex & Geddy, and the string section! There's 3 or 4 riffs, intentional or not, (I don't care either way 'cause they're awesome), that directly reference other Rush songs, like the intro to \\"Headlong Flight\\" that definitely recalls the intro to \\"Bastille Day\\". The playing is as good as ANYTHING theye've ever done. Sometimes I underestimate Alex's contributions because his sounds are often so thick & layered, and usually a little unconventional. But I really, really dig what I'm hearing from him here. Neil sounds incredibly, incredibly loose. And there are places that contain some of Geddy's most agressive playing ever. I'm not throwing myself up as an expert, but I've learned several of his lines over the years, and there's more than a couple of places here where he sounds so powerful but still in total control. And a big tip to the co-producer Nick R. and the engineers. Wide, powerful, and clear. There's at least four tracks on here I'll be listening to for the rest of my life, just like I do with 2112, Xanadu, La Villa Strangiato, Natural Science,  The Camera Eye, Losing It, Between the Wheels, Emotion Detector, Turn the Page, Hand Over Fist, Bravado, Double Agent, Driven, and many, many more. Peace!<br /><br />(2 weeks later) I can't stop listening. I've tried twice to listen to something else, but I really just wanted to listen to Clockwork Angels again. At home, in the car, at the office. All Clockwork Angels - all the time. Just like the good old days would have been if mp3 players had existed. I know this is just my opinion. There are many other reviews that love it that have wildly different interpretations than mine. I read them and think, \\"It doesn't sound anything like that to me.\\". But it's all good and them some. I haven't dug this deep into a Rush album since Roll The Bones. I haven't dug this deep into any album since '05 with Porcupine Tree's Deadwing. That's how much this record means to me. Going down as one of my all-time favorites. Again, Peace!
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|The original Sherlock Holmes by Arthrur Conan Doyle was an eccentric genius that could master any craft he undertook, which is why Guy Ritchie's (see all his movies) version, plot and characters are believable (In this day and age plots (and books) are like long tweets. No one reads them). It is also great story telling, pure macho, fun, opera, romance, all the characters, male and female are fully developed, great in an engaging plot that moves fast, never lets up. For Sherlock Holmes fans, I also suggest Preston and Child's (keep you on the edge of your seat) Agent Penderghast, series, a modern day Sherlock Holmes. He's the man.
B0086700CM|5.0|great game very addictive its a must play and its free so what do ya gotta lose except the time that you end up playing this game. I love it.
0345803507|5.0|This trilogy is one of the best I have ever read,  It's definitely a \\"can't put it down\\" reading. A beautiful love story with many twists and turns.  I love Christian Grey! He definitly has many shades; sad,romantic,passionate, controlling and fifty more.
B006ON41FC|5.0|It is a very fun game for everybody.Luv the graphics and everything about i would totally recommend it to a lot of people and i know that tjlhey would love it too.sorry for the grammar mistakes in this review
B003Y74KAW|3.0|If your need is for a less slippery grip on your phone then this is an inexpensive and reasonable solution. If your need is for protection, though, this helps only minimally.
B00753MBHA|2.0|I was very excited when this album came out. The excitement quickly died down after I gave this CD a spin or two. The only song that really caught my attention was 'Shadow Soldiers'. Everything else was mostly just your standard, generic, German, run-of-the-mill heavy metal metal filler.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|As a creative person myself I absolutely loved this game! There were quite a few combinations that caused me to chuckle to myself. For the people frustrated that they would never think of some of the combos I would just say that is why the developers put the rechargeable hints. I would love to give ideas for even more combos to the developers :-)
B0011TMGKG|5.0|My daughter is six months old and she absolutely loves this toy. I think it's clever too. It's colorful and makes a different noise then any other toy she has (not a rattle or a bell).
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's fun, but you don't get all the games at first you earn them.  For free you cant beat it!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I love being able to access my home server from my phone.  It works everytime and it works fast.  No lag on 3G.
B007712XAU|5.0|I read all of the reviews before selecting the complete seasons 1 and 2. It seems that my copy of season 2 does include the Christmas Episode. Not sure how -- maybe the copy I have was released after Feb 2012 when this episode had been shown on US PBS stations.
B0086700CM|4.0|this game is really addictive and fun, and it works great on the kindle. I have one problem with it though. this is going to sound stupid, but the noise that the coins make when you collect them is really annoying. it is different than the apple store version in that for each coin you don't hear a click or whatever. it is for every other coin or something. anyway you should still get this game, just its a little annoying how it is different.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|this game is wonderfull. it has easy game play and great visual. effects. if you liked angry birds and enjoy a good challenge then get angry birds space!
B007WFTFG6|4.0|My granddaughter had fun playing with this app. She knows her colors and enjoyed it very much. It was easy to use and garnered plenty of repeats!
B007REAIUE|5.0|This album scratches my itch for classic rockabilly, honky tonk music from the 50's. It's a loving tribute to the proto-rock of a bygone era while still retaining a modern sensibility.
B0067AC5KA|4.0|Excellent Books<br />The 1st and 2nd books were better<br />than the 3rd book (minimal reference to<br />Girl with the Tattoo) except near the end.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I love the story, love the characters, love the book!!  This is a great read, following 50shadesofgrey, it lived up to my expectations.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|I downloaded it because so many people give it five stars.but it has some terrible ads harmful to my child.so uninstalled.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|By far the best keyboard available. Types smooth like butter on tmo sgs2. Picked it up free and have since tried other keyboards like swype and go launcher keyboard... I always end up coming back to swiftkey.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|This game on the kindle is fantastic,I would recommend this game for all uno lovers &lt;3 It's very fun ^_^
B002KSPKRS|5.0|The Xbox is hooked up to the TV in my bedroom so when the wife is sleeping, I can still play Xbox all I want with these. I have had the X11's for a few years, but wireless is definitely the way to go. The sound quality is awesome, when you are wearing these, you can hear which side an enemy is coming from because each speaker works independently. They are 100 times better than the cheap headset that comes with the Xbox. I found a used pair for like $70, one of my best purchases ever.
B005HSL626|5.0|LOL.Um I love this game,it is awesome and addicting u guys...plez get it.This game is super fun :) I promise ;)
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I read the first book--because I heard how really good it was.  After the first fifty or so pages I was beginning to think \\"this is really stupid.\\"  The sex is repetitive and after page after page of the same thing- only a different place--elevator, piano, floor, bed, the red room it became boring also.  The writing was not the highest quality.  There were lots of $10.00 words the author used to make us think she knew what she was saying when actually sometimes less is more.  I have read the first 2 books.  I hardly made it through book 2 but I kept plugging along ( and what the heck are butt plugs.)  I am undecided if I want to read the third one--I know some people who say it is the worst of the three.  I think maybe a month between 2 and 3 to digest if I want more of this garbage is fair.  I wish I had borrowed it instead of paying for it for my kindle.  Once it is on there you feel you have to read it or its money down the drain.

B007MAETA8|5.0|This album is amazing, start to finish. It's mostly acoustic so if you like the Hendrix-y style of Mayer than this might not be your cup of tea but from a songwriting stand point it's amazing.
B0086700CM|4.0|Okay I love the game and when it came out on the kindle I knew I had to get it.The graphics are wonderful. But when I go to turn sometimes it picks up as a jump, and then when I jump it picks it up as a slide. I can ignore it most of the, but what I really have a problem with is the glitches. I know there are glitches on a lot of games, but this one has way too many. That's annoying and irritating.<br /><br />Fix the glitches and the touch problems and I would give it five stars.

0345803485|1.0|The author knows next to nothing about American slang, which is hideously obvious, and I really can't help but be horrified that she got this idea from 'Twilight', so I hear. It's disappointing that people use that book series as inspiration to write something as awful as 'Fifty Shades Of Grey'. If the author reads this, which I doubt will occur, research where you're writing about or stick with what you know. I don't know why this made it onto any bestseller lists other than to hope that maybe people wrote it to give themselves something to laugh at. That's the only plausible explanation I can think of.
0345803507|5.0|I have read review after review that was not so great about these books. I am here to say this may be the very best series I have ever read.

Fifty Shades is amazing.

I have taken it swimming more than a few times with no problems.  Watch is very accurate for an automatic non-quartz watch.  Runs just a few seconds fast each day like most automatics from any manufacturer.  Highly recommended.
B000FC10MU|2.0|Neil Gaiman is a wordsmith. I have thoroughly enjoyed his books written 'for all ages'. However, I am very uncomfortable with some 'adult' themes. I couldn't get past the 'eff...' words and some explicit sexual descriptions. I had to stop reading; hence, only two stars.

B003XT8Y3K|3.0|I am upgrading my review somewhat-perhaps my expectations were a bit inflated. Still I really cannot understand all of these impassioned reviews. I loved Kaufmann's recital of German arias-these Italian ones are not quite his thing, as the voice is too heavy, and the timbre is cloying. He is a wonderful artist-I'm just not sure about this repertoire. The recording is spectacular.
B006NFKUF6|5.0|During the game it was very well created and well thought out. I will reconmend this game to all viewers.
B005STGJHQ|5.0|I too initially would have preferred if this was 180g, only because that usually means they take greater care with the pressing.  In this case, they appear to have taken great care anyway!  The reasons I generally prefer 180g is for the lower surface noise, less defects that cause pops and clicks, and because it's less likely to warp.  So, although there is a slight warp on one edge, the part that really matters (the sound) is covered on all bases.  The vinyl is nearly dead silent and I heard no audible pops or clicks through the whole album... the production quality is much higher than many of my so-called audiophile grade records.  As for the music itself, I never thought I'd say this album sounded sonically amazing, but here it does!  The CD sounds like it's being broadcast on FM in comparison.  It even sounds way better than my original This Is A Call 7\\".  Highly recommended!

B007OAAK0O|5.0|....as stated by Diana Ross while onstage in the rain, as someone comes to her and apparently tells her to \\"Stop the show.\\"  But not Diana Ross  :)<br /><br />The 2nd concert is great, but the concert during the storm makes this DVD outstanding documentation of a major event and demonstration of the qualities that made Diana Ross a long time superstar.<br /><br />Ms. Ross' talent and her genuine love for her audience, and them to her, are apparent in both shows.  But in the first show, we see it all....the Diva....as the wind keeps blowing hair in her face, she turns to the wind and says \\"cool it\\".....the business woman giving onstage direction to stagehands ....her sense of drama as she throws her arms up to the storm....the guardian of her audience as she safely directs them from the park and ..yes...her temper...yelling to the NYC Policemen to stop pushing.  (The next day, she thanked and flirted with them from the stage)<br /><br />But Diana Ross can't stop the storm and it finally must end.  She stays on stage while the audience leaves, watching her lifelong dream of doing a great outdoor concert melt.  That's when she throws caution to the wind and says, \\"We'll do this again tomorrow.\\"<br /><br />And so the show does go on ...the next day...on a beautiful day with a cloudless sky.  Diana Ross is at one of her many career peaks...riding off her hit album with CHIC's producers and signing one of the biggest recording contracts up to that time.  Her energy, talent and beauty are all great.  But again, it's the connection between Diana Ross and the audience...strong and loving...which is so amazing.<br /><br />Incredibly, the concert was not fully appreciated in its time. Because a second show was added, the concert made no profits, which were promised to the city to build a playground in Central Park. The NYC Mayor, Ed Koch,  publicly complained  that Diana Ross did not follow through on the deal, despite the cost to the city to stage the concert.  Ultimately, Diana Ross paid the city $250,000 (approximately $500,000 in today's dollars)and the Diana Ross playground was built.  Luckily, now that the controversy is fully gone, we have this dvd to fully appreciate the concert.<br /><br />A few years ago, I read someone spotted Diana Ross sitting in the playground that bears her name, in sunglasses, alone, no one approaching. So, the writer went up to her and said, \\"Thank you\\".  Whether true or not, I wonder what Ms. Ross would be thinking while she was sitting in the playground..was it of the cheering crowd, or asking \\"Where Did Our Love Go?\\" or continuing optimism in the face of life's storms.<br /><br />In any case... \\"Thank you, Ms. Ross\\"  and from all your fans, the love is still there.
B005NZH1JA|5.0|I was a little hesitant to start watching Season 4. Season 3 ended so disturbingly, I felt I needed a break from the show. In Episode 10, everything just clicks: All that is confusion begins to make sense. It was just so superb. \\"Salud\\" is by far the best episode of the season--perhaps of the best Breaking Bad episode ever. The conclusion did remind me of some drama I might have seen about ancient Rome -- although I can't quite say exactly which TV show or movie it resonates with; but yes, even though Gustavo is a bad, bad man, you can't help but admire his genius and maybe even feel a little sympathetic with him. I hope Sklar has not made a wrong turn with Beneke.

B008BYXQJY|1.0|Important: My 1 star rate is no about the album per se, which I haven't yet listened to, but the purchasing experience.<br />I rushed to buy the \\"normal\\" version of this album just to immediately realize there was another \\"Deluxe\\" version with three more songs for the same price. It had happened to me before with their previous album \\"Hands All Over\\" that I purchased with the Digital Booklet, which I didn't care about, instead of the three extra songs that I had to purchase separately. I'm so irate about falling again in the same bait and switch trap (from Amazon?) that I tried to return or cancel my order, which of course can't be done. This time I won't purchase the extra songs, but I'll get them from any other place (*wink).
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|What with all the SEAL team 6 news and the secrecy that covers their every move it was a refreshing surprise to read about Adam Brown. This is a story that needed to be written to show the very human side of these brave and fearless men who stand at the very tip of the spear safe guarding our freedoms.<br /><br />When one reads the news reports of one shot kills and Ben Laden takedown they appear to be made of steel rather than flesh and bone. Adam Brown and his buddys show us they are so much more and I'm reminded of the gentle Sheep Dog who guards the flock. May God bless them all.
B007O3QC8K|4.0|For this CD to attract over a dozen reviews so quickly attests to the importance of any new release by the Berlin Phil.  The orchestra took the Bruckner Ninth on tour, and it's become their habit, it seems, to do a CD as a follow-up almost every year. In concert the main impression one got was of overwhelming power, and although recordings level out how orchestras sound, there's enough here to convince any listener that the Ninth received a powerhouse reading. But there's a cultural dilemma facing conductors now that the Austro-German performance tradition is in its twilight: how does one speak Bruckner as a second language?<br /><br />When Furtwangler, Karajan, Knappertsbusch, Celibidache, and Klemperer were rising, Bruckner was part of the native speech of Austrian musicians, lending such an air of local authenticity that it was often claimed that Bruckner's music didn't travel beyond the Tyrol. It was hard for outsides to grasp his sprawling monumentality without hearing all kinds of mistakes in classical form. Even Furtwangler claimed that only the Seventh was satisfying structurally, and Leonard Bernstein openly disdained the whole canon except for the Ninth.  (This was analogous to the long era of neglect that Mahler went through, always excepting the general agreement that he was a great composer of songs - if only he hadn't embarrassed himself with those leviathan symphonies.)<br /><br />Rattle doesn't speak Bruckner and has had to learn it as a second language, gathering together the elements of his own style - he's certainly not alone in that. What I hear in his concoction is something to admire: solid musicianship, appealing contrasts between drama and lyricism, carefully gauged climaxes built from understated beginnings, and a deft handling of melody. Is that good enough? It depends. This Ninth doesn't strike me as belonging to a category higher than, say, Maazel's Bruckner. (So far as learning a foreign tongue goes, turn to Takashi Asahina, the great Japanese devotee of Bruckner, and you will hear how much heartfelt expression really matters. Asahina made no fewer than three complete Bruckner cycles.) I certainly don't hear the stunning authority of Furtwangler and Karajan. Nothing goes amiss, but there's a difference between building a mansion and building a cathedral. Lost in that difference, Rattle doesn't make the Adagio a stairway to God, which it can be - one remembers that Bruckner was as religious a composer as Bach.<br /><br />As for the completion of the fourth movement, it's the typical cobbled together result of musicologists furrowing their brows for years - there's a shell of Brucknerian gestures with no real musical interest, certainly nothing that could be called real Bruckner. He didn't leave enough finished material, he voluntarily gave up on the finale because of diminished energies, many sketches are lost, and most importantly, Bruckner was a composer of such genius and originality that no group of musicologists has the remotest chance of completing his masterpiece.<br /><br />For me, this Bruckner Ninth isn't a breakthrough for Rattle, but it shows him in a very accomplished mode, with the Berliners following his lead implicitly. Real inspsiration sounds different.panese devotee of Bruckner, and you will hear how much heartfelt expression really matters. Asahina made no fewer than three complete Bruckner cycles.)

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Since this book is an example of \\"fan fiction\\" I too shall borrow from one of my favorite movies and give a two word review. Shit sandwich.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This book relates the story of Shin Dong-hyuk as he is born in one of the worst camps in the most repressive countries in the world: North Korea.  It provides the highlights to his life, by focusing on the particularly grim episodes. I will not lay them out specifically here, but they are shocking.  My God, how shocking.  I thought about those isolated incidents from the news of parents restraining their kids to a potty chair, leading to their poor development and I get a sense of what a country would be like if they were the sole rulers, and North Korea comes to rushing to the front of my mind.<br /><br />Tellingly, Shin has a hard time adjusting to life back in the world outside his awful.  The doctors cited in the book say he has a form of PTSD.  How similar to a battlefield is it when a single wrong step can lead to torture and death?<br /><br />The most shocking moments are those that happens to his family.  What he must do in order to survive are traumatic to say the least.<br /><br />Ultimately, Shin's message must get out. To say that his escape was a miracle is to be an understatement.  Another reviewer commented that this book is too \\"political\\".  That is false.  Here is a story that transcends politics, for the very notion of a government is to provide some basic rights to its citizens and to that it has failed utterly.  If one looks at the flawed nations today, one thinks that even on some basic level, places like Somalia provide some effort to benefit its citizens, or at least it doesn't try to harm them.  This story is about what human beings are capable of when they are conditioned to be cruel and even see their own parents as foes, thus upending millions of years of evolution.<br /><br />Haunting and urgent, I highly recommend this book.
B000EOTAM6|4.0|This is a new twist on the cloning debate.  I must admit, I am not familiar with the animated series or comic serials this film is based on.  My review is primarily from a Charlize Theron fan's point of view.  The story, the characters, the special effect and the overall mood of the story are all a bit unexpected.<br /><br />As a film, Aeon Flux does not disappoint.  It combines great characters, a complex plot, and great special effects in an entertaining format that zips by in a 92 minutes.  The alternate society is a varied theme that generally creates a blank canvas for writers and directors to play with freely.  Here, Kusama, Manfredi, Chung, and Hay step up to answer the call well.  Action begins quickly and integrates viewers in an alternate world rather quickly.  It is a strange world though.<br /><br />Aeon portrays a rogue assassin who betrays her mission when unanswered questions collide with residual memories of another lifetime.  Coincidence and circumstance lead her into a precarious position between future and past.  In the end, her decision demonstrates heroic wisdom and courage demanded of a science-fiction character. Theron captures Aeon's character well.<br /><br />Charlize Theron is sexy, smart, and daring. Her ability to present Aeon's conflict is genuine.  She also stands alone as a unique hero in a complex universe.  This modern Hollywood princess skillfully uses all action, dialogue, and pacing. Her physical beauty harmonizes well with her grace and athletic prowess.  Charlize Theron is a fantastic actor.<br /><br />The plot is interesting.  I certainly didn't expect events to unfold as they did.  I do like the pace and fluidity involved.  The pivotal scene in which Aeon must convince Sith Andra her intentions are pure is a little sudden, but definitely not forced.  I believe a little history leading up to Aeon's mission would have been well worth the extra time it would have added to the movie.  In the end, most questions are answered, and the story feels complete.he story feels complete.
0062183591|5.0|I eagerly awaited my Kindle version of this book, having very much enjoyed the author's other works - especially \\"Predictably Irrational\\". This book is written in a very similar style. Self contained chapters look at different aspects of why we do things the way we do, filled with interesting personal anecdotes and descriptions of experiments conducted.<br /><br />This is a popular science book, in that it does not provide you with all the data, sample sizes, statistical variations and other guff that would serve to confuse many readers, or at least turn interesting anecdotes into dry ones. Instead the author provides a link back to the academic papers he is describing in his endnotes, and I think that worked very well. Here was a book filled with plenty to interest any reader, but a means to verify the claims made by the more academically inclined.<br /><br />The subject of the book is dishonesty and cheating, and Ariely manages to demonstrate some quite counterintuitive facts about our propensity to cheat, showing how effects such as social norms, effects of in-groups and out groups, supervision, and even recollection of moral principles all affect our behaviour. Interestingly he shows that even given the perfect opportunity to cheat to the maximum without consequences, nearly all of us opt to only cheat a little - and he proposes the mechanisms by which we mitigate our behaviour.<br /><br />There are plenty of public policy implications from this work, as well as helpful guides to the reader as to how to control their own nature. I was struck, at times, by how many of these ideas to manage our own moral compass actually were not new at all. Instead, the research presented served to explain why things many people have discovered over the years are effective after all.<br /><br />A real eye opener for me, however, was the demonstration that early intervention for minor misdemeanours was, in fact, much more important than intervention for later ones. Once it was stated, this idea seemed to me to be obvious, and yet I doubt I would have thought of it without the experiments that demonstrated the effect.<br /><br />So all in all a very good and interesting read, filled with plenty of anecdotes, and experiments that seemed to cover a range of walks of life (from students to bankers or politicians) and nationalities (turns out that no nationality stands out when it comes to our propensity to cheat).<br /><br />Thoroughly recommended. This and Ariely's other works should be required reading for anyone who holds to a view that humans always act in the name of their rational self interest. Ariely shows once and for all that we do not.

B000QXDED6|5.0|The story of the battle of thermopylae is rightly one of the most enduring and important last stands in history. Without this battle the whole of European history would be very different. Persia would have destroyed the Greek army and the later victories would not have occurred. It also has all the elements of a heroic tragedy. 300 Spartans hold back the Persians for 3 days at the hot gates (thermoplae in Greek), and end up dying heroically.<br /><br />It is therefore a perfect battle for a good Hollywood film. But this film is more (and less) than a historical telling. It includes quite a lot of historical detail, such as the names of the heros and villains, or the event where the Persian emissaries were pushed down a well, but it also very deliberately plays with that history, by introducing mythical beasts, and stylising the Persians in particular in mystical but very ahistorical ways.<br /><br />The end result is a beautifully wrought imaginary epic, loosely based on actual events. The film was shot on blue screen with studio sets, and this shows. Sparta feels like a sound studio, and the hot gates have an enclosed feel. All this would have felt cheap if it was intended as a historical film, but because it was essentially a fantasy, it all somehow worked, and allowed some beautiful cinematography.<br /><br />However, anyone left with the impression that it really was juts 300 noble Spartans making the last stand should maybe go check the history. True there were 300 Spartans ked by King Leonidas, but they were, in the historical battle, outnumbered by some 400 Thebans and probably even more Helots. Also the enslavement of the majority of the population of Sparta (the Helots) is brushed aside and ignored, giving the impression Sparta was populated Spartans, and not that they were ruling overlords like the Normans in 12th Century England.<br /><br />nevertheless this is a great film. The introduction of mythical elements serve as a warning that this is not a historical depiction, so I don't feel angry about those points as I would if it was being passed off as history. Instead I enjoyed a thoroughly entertaining action film, and would recommend it to anyone who likes action films of any type.

B0035G0U2O|3.0|This is a remarkably silly film, going from the preposterous to the totally unbelievable without apology. It does, however, have great special effects. It is worth watching for the effects, but lacks any credibility or grand message.

If you know any science at all, try to forget it before watching.

0385736002|4.0|Maybe I am just reading too much of this genre, but I was not overly taken with this book. I have seen it often but ignored it for a long time because the name \\"Nicholas Flamel\\" made me (wrongly) believe it was riding on the coat tails of Harry Potter.<br /><br />In fact this is an original tale using the quasi historical Flamel and just about every other mythological and quasi historical character to make a far reaching story about twins with special powers.<br /><br />There is a good amount of orginal research in this book, but the story itself seemed to be very much like a number of other stories rehashed. Younger readers will probably not notice that or care, so recommended for young adults, but nothing deep or meaningful or highly original in this book.<br /><br />Nevertheless don't take my words to heart. I mean - twins with special powers - that just has to be a book young adults will love.
0061743526|3.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is one of those books that has become so much a part of the cultural landscape it's easy to forget you may not have actually read it. I did - but now I have.<br />A classic of American literature Harper Lee's first and only published novel is  the story of small town 30's Alabama with all the `\\"Why ah jez seen Miss Polly down bah the riversahde\\"ness it implies.<br /><br />Progressively minded lawyer Atticus Finch defends a young black man who, as far as that time and place goes, was born guilty. The story is narrated by Finch's young daughter who with her older brother are the first to register the rancour of a community united in ignorance and qualified by fear. The story's real climax comes halfway through the book and for me subsequently fails to justify much of its continuation thereafter.<br /><br />Being published on the eve of affirmative action and the civil rights movement it's not difficult to appreciate the impact it had when it appeared on the best sellers lists of the early 60's - but to fully appreciate To Kill a Mockingbird's power and importance you feel you really had to have been there. Then again, the tune may have changed but the song remains the same.
0345536886|4.0|Nice character driven plot.  The fifth star was lost on the ending.  It was as if Grisham was in a hurry to complete the story in a finite amount of pages.  Overall, very entertaining and humorously realistic likable flawed humans trying to survive as lawyers with a little drama before the disappointingly hasty completion.  Has anyone ever told John Grisham that it is not necessary to tie up all the loose unfinished ends of a story?
B00772M1F6|5.0|You may be familiar with J.D McPhearson's Northside Girl having been given surprisingly `heavy rotation' on BBC Radio recently. Had it been released in the mid 50's it may well have sunk without a trace in an era that boasted Little Richard, Chuck Berry and Gene Vincent - but here in the second decade of the 21st century it appears like an ice cold Peroni in a hot house of horse pucky.<br /><br />Although unashamedly retro in design, Signs & Signifiers is no straight nostalgia trip. No note for note Scotty Moore/Cliff Gallup licks here - S & S brings some new flavours to the pot and suggests the past isn't quite over yet and that the future's due a reboot. For instance the title track is a moody voodoo chant reminiscent of something from Springsteen's Nebraska album... but with better vocals.<br />And what vocals! - Like a polite Little Richard with heavy shades of Wynonie Harris, Bunker Hill, Jackie Wilson and Fats Domino, McPheason is accompanied by a phenomenal band recorded with old school RCA ribbon microphones on to analogue tape. Lyrically S&S breaks no barriers but the overall sound is poetry enough. Every track is a master class in sonic excellence - the Telecaster honks like a brass section, the drums snap and rattle like they're supposed to and those Saxes pour out of the speakers like honey.<br /><br />Signs & Signifiers, along with Chris Issacs' new `Beyond the Sun' album and Richard Hawley's current Rockabilly show on Radio 2 - not to mention a massive underground fan base that's never gone away - you could be forgiven for believing that the 50's revival that's been building since Jan 1st 1960 has almost arrived.

Her mother always reprimands her for doing unladylike things, which cover just about everything she likes, and instructs her how to be proper and respectful. The lessons culminate when Merida is expected to marry the young man who wins the competition between the three clans in the kingdom. Refusing to conform to convention, Merida decides to compete for her own hand and wins. She and her mother fight, leaving both tearful, frustrated, and angry. Merida rides into the woods and is let to a witch's cottage by wisps. After buying all the witch's wooden wares, she gives Merida a spell to changer her mother which would in turn change her fate. The spell doesn't go as Merida wanted, so she and her mother go in search of the witch to change her mother back to the way she was.<br /><br />I have been looking forward to Brave for a long time and it definitely didn't disappoint me. This is the first Pixar film to feature both a setting in the past and a female protagonist. Both the medieval Scottish setting and Merida serve the film well. The lush greens and wonderful Scottish landscapes are just perfect for this film. They really help in creating the mood of possibility, mystery, and magic. The visuals are breathtakingly beautiful and seem more realistic than many other recent computer animated films. Merida is a breath of fresh air after so many simpering, weak, boring female protagonists of recent years. Merida is as fiery and wild as her hair. She knows who she is and what she wants in life. Her intelligence and cleverness sometimes get her into trouble, but it's nice to see these qualities revered for once. Even though she rashly makes decisions without thinking them through and hurts some people in the process, I appreciated that this warrior princess erred on the side of impulse. Beneath it all, she truly loved and cared for her family, but didn't really know how to balance their needs with her own. Her endearing personality and the goodness at her core outweighed her carelessness and the ramifications of her impulsive actions on everyone around her.<br /><br />I don't believe this is really a children's film. It's a film that really speaks to mothers and teenage daughters. The conflict between Merida and her mother Elinor that is in the center of this film has no clear side that is right. Merida wants what any teenage girl wants: freedom to be herself and pursue her dreams. An arranged marriage is the last thing she wants. Elinor, on the other hand, has more than herself and her daughter to think about. The fate of the kingdom is in her hands and she must think of the kingdom's safety and wellbeing as well as her family's. Both of these women have valid worries and concerns. If they had spoken to each other rationally, they may have resolved their problems before anyone got transformed, but they are both stubborn and felt they couldn't open up to each other. I think anyone can relate to not being able to communicate with their parents or their teenaged children. Although there is a witch that can be blamed on the surface for Merida and Elinor's predicament, the real villain of the piece is really Merida, her rash decisions, and her inability to take responsibility for them. The witch is an easy scapegoat for younger viewers who don't yet understand more complex themes, but she is only in the film for a very short time and isn't particularly malicious. Some of the humor in the film is fairly simple and childish I believe to entertain young children, but the bulk of the film is for a much older crowd.<br /><br />One of the main shining stars of this film for me is the soundtrack. It is phenomenal and is rapidly becoming one of my favorites. I'm not too familiar with Patrick Doyle's body of work besides Thor, but after this I will seek out anything else he does. The soundtrack is incredibly varied and utilizes a variety of instruments from the Scottish culture, such as bagpipes, dulcimers, flutes, a fiddle, and a bodhran. Scottish reels and jigs create excitement and momentum, while a simple lullaby theme featuring quiet dulcimer and solemn fiddle create tenderness and sadness. My favorite is the lullaby theme from the song Noble Maiden Fair sung in Gaelic by Merida and Elinor. When that theme recurs throughout the film, it just pulls on my heart strings and makes me cry. I also loved that 3 featured songs came from the movie: Touch the Sky and Into the Open Air performed by Julie Fowlis, my new favorite Scottish singer, and Learn Me Right by Mumford and Sons. I love all these songs and have been listening to the whole soundtrack on loop since I saw it earlier this week. Another gorgeous song by Julie Fowlis was featured in the trailer for Brave, but wasn't on the soundtrack called Tha Mo Ghaol Air Aird A' Chuain. It's another gorgeous song with Julie Fowlis' pure tones and a simple strings accompaniment and one of two that are actually in Gaelic.<br /><br />In addition to being incredibly entertaining, full of heart, and full of emotion, Brave is a good step forward in fairy tale films. First, it's an original tale with the basic trappings that put the audience at ease. However, the conclusion is much different than most princess stories. ** SPOILERS** At the end of the film, Merida and Elinor come to a compromise and it's agreed by all the the young people will choose their own spouses. Unlike many other fairy tales, there is no real love interest for Merida and she doesn't get married at the end. She is not defined as a character by any romantic relationship. It also lets the audience see an alternative to marriage or having a family as a life choice in general. I found that refreshing in a genre that almost always ends with a marriage and a happily ever after. I loved Brave and consider it one of my favorite Pixar films. It wasentertaining to both children and adults and pushed the boundaries of what a fairy tale princess film can be.
B000002KBU|5.0|Joni Mitchell's Blue album is perhaps her finest album of all time. It contains songs that hit every emotion, there is. Songs like River, Blue and A Case of You, stand out as some of this singer-songwriter's most touching work. It has been said, she wrote these songs while going through a depression that really brought out every possible emotion there could ever be. If anyone wants to hear Joni's finest work, this is the album to buy. If this doesn't turn you into an instant fan of this remarkable writer then, I don't know what will. It is an extraordinary piece of work.

B000003CM9|5.0|Idlewild South was recorded while The Allman Brothers were consantly touring to build their fan base and any few days they didn't have a concert, Duane Allman was quickly running to different studios to work as a session guitarist. Idlewild South shows that The Allmans were maturing very fast with songs like Midnight Rider and In Memory of Elizabeth Reed that were perfected on the road and recorded in the studio as a full band. Any dubs were only to correct a flubbed note or two. This album was recorded in several different studios. If Tom Dowd didn't think the song came out good enough, the band would get back out on the road and work that song until it was ready to record. This album shows the twin lead guitars from Duane Allman and Dickey Betts had become perfected. This is a great album of The Allman Brothers learning year and soon, Eric Clapton and Duane Allman would soon work together on the Layla album.
B007NZDES0|5.0|Absolutely loved her live concert and wished I could have followed her around on the CA tour - but since I could not do that, I eagerly awaited the release of the LIVE DVD and AM NOT disappointed!  The DVD (and CD) are really awesome and the second best thing to actually attending her amazing concert.
B000NDEXOI|4.0|40 SEASONS is a good compilation from SKID ROW...SKID got only 3 albuns with SEBASTIAN BACH, so it´s not much ground to pick the ones to a greatest hits...I miss many good songs, but if you want the BASIC HITS from SKID ROW, this one is great!!!
B008FC4WA4|5.0|Nick Hornby never disappoints--he always manages to be both funny and heartbreaking, often in the same sentence. His latest hapless Romeo, Charlie, is as lovable as he is dunderheaded. Though you can understand why his wife, Elaine, is keen to exact her revenge (Charlie won't be winning a Father of the Year award any time soon, though he'd be a shoo-in at a drinking contest), you can't help but feel for the guy. No one deserves this kind of public humiliation at the hands of an angry and over-articulate ex--not even Charlie.
B001GSV3EC|5.0|Q: Just how many live Jeff Beck CDs does anyone really need?<br />A: All of them.<br /><br />First, I bought the DVD of this material and thought that would be sufficient, especially because it had several vocal performances, by exceptionally talented and lovely female singers, as well as BONUS material. The DVD is a must have item. Then, I found it inconvenient to play the DVD while I was driving, so I had to have the CD, even if it did not have all the extra bells and whistles. What I found is that cranked up in the interior of my vehicle, or through my closed cup headphones, or blasting through my home stereo speakers, or on the convenient laptop, the purely instrumental Live Adventures of Jeff, Tal (bass), Vinnie (drums), and Jason (keys) at Ronnie Scott's dive are sufficient unto the day (and the evil thereof).<br /><br />You may already possess versions of many of these numbers as done by Jeff and his interchangeable army of master musicians in innumerable variations and formations. Fear not, for the true believer, any Jeff Beck recording from Truth to The Next Big Thing are basically essential, at any given moment. So boldly go where no guitarist has gone before with Jeff and his Crew by buying with confidence this recording, and that is The Truth.<br /><br />Sound: A-<br />Performance: A+<br />Set List: A<br />Band: Bass - solid bottom A+; Drums - infinite rhythm A+; Keys -luminous ebony & ivory A.
B004A8EI9M|5.0|5 stars over all ,<br /> I was not a zombie guy before this movie , This is not just a horror movie like night of the living dead , it has that ,, but its also a science fiction movie,With VERY HEAVY DRAMA overtones,..<br />  Top shelf stuff , This is one of those shows that makes life worth the effort , That's how good it is.<br /> Only other made for tv series i can think of with the pure entertainment value is Deadwood . It is for nearly the same audience ,Mainly Male ages 15 - 150 . and many Women will love it also .<br />Its a visual carnival ,The premise is pretty basic, Zombie apocalypse,But plausible.<br />Season 1 is setting things up , It will be even better for you if you are familiar with the comic series , as you will see the characters you already know take life . You wont be disappointed ..<br />  For people not familiar it is an introduction to the story and characters.<br />For extremely discerning acting enthusiasts, It might come off a little over acted or underacted in places ,Some character choices may seem illogical .<br /> Don't over think it, Just watch.There is a reason.  ,.. Because season two will bring a lot of that together.<br /><br /> Season two----The whole story is a fuse to the explosion that will take place in 2 and nothing needs to be missed up to this point .It is a masterful work of art,There is no other way of saying it . It has every single element that makes for a good story /movie , all well placed ,and executed with mastery .<br /> There is no overuse of vulgarity like in Deadwood , It is present , but isn't used for effect , Just when necessary,even then its not the type that makes you cringe.They seem to have kept in mind that kids would be watching this, I cannot recall any nudity offhand.<br /> That said , This is a violent movie and how . I began hating the interludes between the zombie attacks because the situations they have to fight themselves out of are so entertaining , But as season two progressed those human interactions began to take shape .and take the spotlight.<br />  This is one of the few that will withstand re-watching a few times over the years,  therefore i recommend buying not renting , Set some time aside and enjoy it but beware of watching the entire thing in one night , savor it .Or you will be like me wishing they would HURRY THE HECK up with season three!!. Go to AMC website and learn a bit more . And if you like this , and are an adult .... you'll probably like Deadwood also .

1609611543|5.0|Wheat Belly: Lose the Weight, Lose the Wheat, and Find Your Path Back to Health<br />William Davis, MD<br /><br />Every day, over 200 million Americans consume food products made of wheat. As a result, over 100 million of them experience some form of adverse health effect, ranging from minor rashes and high blood sugar to the unattractive stomach bulges that preventive cardiologist William Davis calls \\"wheat bellies.\\" According to Davis, that excess fat has nothing to do with gluttony, sloth, or too much butter: it's due to the whole grain wraps we eat for lunch.<br /> After witnessing over 2,000 patients regain their health after giving up wheat, Davis reached the disturbing conclusion that wheat is the single largest contributor to the nationwide obesity epidemic'and its elimination is key to dramatic weight loss and optimal health.  In Wheat Belly, Davis exposes the harmful effects of what is actually a product of genetic tinkering and agribusiness being sold to the American public as \\"wheat\\"'and provides readers with a user-friendly, step-by-step plan to navigate a new, wheat-free lifestyle.<br />Informed by cutting-edge science and nutrition, along with case studies from men and women who have experienced life-changing transformations in their health after waving goodbye to wheat, Wheat Belly is an illuminating look at what is truly making Americans sick and an action plan to clear our plates of this seemingly benign ingredient.<br />I found this book to be a fountain of information. I agreed on many points especially the engineered food that is available in the grocery store. It is true that there is a significantly different looking weight gain in this country. I am not so sure that wheat is the only cause for this. The American diet has changed significantly in the last 30 years.  I would go so far as to say that wheat is a major cause but not the sole cause. Food has been engineered with corn, peas, carrots and the list could go on. You go through any organic produce section and the size is significantly smaller with every kind. Gluten intolerance is not the only problem increasing peanut allergies and nut allergies alone have increased. High Fructose Corn Syrup has replaced sugar in almost every food that once had sugar as its sweetener. I believe these have contributed equally to our problems.<br />The overall information presented and the diet he promotes are healthful and would impact many people lives. I do believe that the search for healthy eating is not solved by eliminating wheat alone. I find this to limiting.<br />The information was in depth and well researched. The information was well written and easy to understand for the most part. At times there was more information than the average person needs.<br />I would like to thank Net Galley and Rodale Publishing for allowing me to read and review this book in return for a free copy and was never asked to write a favorable review by anyone.ic produce section and the size is significantly smaller with every kind.

B007549W62|2.0|I'm a little late to the party for this review so I'll keep it short and sweet.  Apocalyptic thriller that takes itself far more serious than the casting director obviously did.  I mean, really?  He must have promised his old college roommates he'd get them into a movie some day.  Too bad for director Xavier Gens because he's got quite a knack for the technical aspects of film making.  Beautiful shots, nice use of sound, slick and stylish while keeping with the overall darkness of the plot... Just those dang actors!  Probably not totally their fault, they are being forced to play some of the most unlikable human survivors this side of... I don't know, that show Survivor maybe(never seen it, but heard bad things)?  So all in all what did the Divide teach me?  That if you were a miserable person before, surviving a nuclear attack certainly won't help brighten your outlook on things any(also be selective when running into shelters during emergencies, I know your life is at stake but-- these are the people you are most likely spending the rest of your life with!  It's okay to be picky).  I also learned that The Divide runs about 20 minutes too long(why must ALL movies be 2 hours now?  Even horror and romantic comedies?  Why?!), and learning is half the battle.  Pass.  *Quick aside.  For those on the look for something really sick and twisted-- this ain't it!  The film is hyped as being fairly depraved, and maybe to the casual moviegoer it is, but if you're a horror/cult cinema regular then there's nothing overly memorable in that department here. End aside.*
B003Y5HWMW|2.0|I purchased this DVD based on the highly favorable reviews. I wish I could be as favorable in my review. The story is very slow moving and drawn out to the point of near boredom. The sound quality is poor with the many low volume personal conversations requiring higher volume to be understood which yields uncomfortable level for most scenes. The all very British language is often difficult to understand.
0439023521|5.0|This book is AMAZING. It is a page turner which makes you think, a lot. As someone who often thinks that best sellers are written in a \\"dumbed down\\" way, I cannot help but highly recommend this book to anyone. Also, while the book is gut-wrenching, the movie is much more so. The book is definitely a better choice for the squeamish, though the book and the movie complement each other well.

1936608898|5.0|I'm so excited to tell you all the reasons why It Starts With Food is the most valuable nutrition book you can have in your possession.  This book is full of so many important pieces of information explaining how food impacts your body, and it exposes in great detail why so many of us have physical and psychological issues with food.  It also equips you with all the information you need to make the best choices to stay healthy for a lifetime.<br /><br />I am not a doctor, nutritionist, personal trainer or Paleo superhero.  I'm just an average person who got really sick with no medical explanation for my symptoms.  Thankfully, through Dallas and Melissa Hartwig's Whole30 program, I discovered food is my medicine.  Now, after reading It Starts With Food, I have a much deeper understanding of why my food choices are so important.<br /><br />One of the main reasons I even did the Whole30 was because I read through the instructions on the Hartwigs' website, whole9life.com, and their tough-love approach and sassy style had me hooked!  It is no surprise that their book is as entertaining as it is informative, making it an easy page turner even when they're talking about things like phytic acid, glucagon and medium-chain triglycerides!<br /><br />To me, It Starts With Food is required reading for the following reasons:<br />It has allowed me to have a greater understanding of my own health issues.  I had no idea how critical my gut is to my total health, but Dallas and Melissa go into great detail about why your intestines hold the key to unlock your complete wellbeing.  To me, this is priceless information!<br /><br />Knowledge is power, and now that I know why I'm tempted by certain food choices and why certain foods have such a negative effect on me, I have the power to make better choices on a daily basis for the rest of my life.<br />This book has made it much easier for me to explain to friends and family why this way of eating is so important.  Science was my worst subject in school, so I'm not very good at explaining all the detailed medical information or \\"science-y stuff,\\" but It Starts With Food has made it much easier for me to put into words why fat is good for you, why there's more to calcium than just drinking milk and taking supplements, and why there's more to cholesterol than a number on a piece of paper.  And if my friends and family want to know more, I just hand them the book!<br /><br />In every chapter, Dallas and Melissa take multiple opportunities to answer the most frequently asked questions on all the hot food-related topics.  They leave you feeling fully informed and totally empowered.  It's awesome.<br />I love that they give you the tools, but then encourage you to take responsibility for yourself.  It seems so many of us refuse to be responsible for our choices or just choose not to listen.  In It Starts With Food, you will not only be educated, but also held accountable.  I find that so refreshing.<br /><br />I truly believe It Starts With Food is going to be a major contribution to a shift toward improved health in our country.  As more people continue to have such drastic improvements and amazing testimonials, it is my hope that word will continue to spread, and that the medical community will be forced to take into account the critical role food has on our total health.

B004EQAVHI|5.0|SPOILER ALERT.  I've tried to remain vague about the details of this movie, but I still couldn't manage to keep spoilers out of my review.  My apologies.<br />Never Let Me Go is a slow-paced, beautifully crafted meditation on what occurs when one group believes it has the right to control the fate of another.  As viewers, our dismay grows as we realize that there is no question about the morality or about the ramifications of this oppression.  What will be, will be, and we are left to ponder the horror this situation engenders.  Never Let Me Go is also a study in contrasts: the inherent dignity of the human spirit overwhelmed by the indignity of oppression.  Love pitted against pitiless, sanctioned hatred.  A heart-rending howl of pain and grief that, in one sense, falls on ears that refuse to hear. In this context the personalities of characters Kathy, Tommy, and Ruth unfold -- as at the same time, we hear them referred to as \\"creatures.\\"  Never Let Me Go maintains a solemn measured pace.  It is a movie for those patient enough to tease out its unanswered mysteries.  You may not glean answers, but you will be left with a richer understanding of the questions we humans ponder:  Who am I? What am I? Do I have a soul? Is fate truly set? To what lengths will I go to delay death? Never Let Me Go is a lovely, strange, solemn film that meticulously draws you in, and then remains with you long after the screen darkens.

The story line is exciting and suspenseful.  I was catapaulted into buying \\"Fifty Shades of Darker\\" because of the suspense in the first book.  I look forward to reading the next two books.  I recommend highly to those over 21 years of age...
B001GZ6QEC|4.0|The blue-ray makes this movie shine, but it would anyway even as a regular DVD. Very re-watchable, so this is one of the few movies I've purchased in blu-ray. I'm more cautious now of buying a big library collection (like in the old days of VHS) and then getting obsoleted. ALSO-I would caution buyers to read carefully what the \\"+BD Live\\" means. I skimmed reading that part too much thinking it was some downloadable digital copy along with the physical blu-ray disk - that's not the case. It's a feature that you can turn on when you insert the disk to play, with the right player (WiFi blah blah). If your looking for the physical blu-ray and a bonus digital copy to have on your devices look elsewhere and read the whole description.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I enjoy this game because you are given the opportunity to play multiple games without having to buy a new one.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good lots of fun games ...just not good for younger kids..games a little hard for kids that cant quite understand the games
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Absolutely love this book, it's the best book I have ever read. It sucks you in from the very first word. Highly recommended.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I´m so happy I bought this, great special features, great 3D combo pack!<br />Completely recommended for those who missed the movie in theathers because of it´s gruesome media campaign.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|i needed a way to get my documents from my computer to my kindle fire in a editable format and this works perfectly! sooo sooo happy with this app!
B008BYXQJY|3.0|There is Overexposed with 12 songs, and there is Overexposed DELUXE version with 15 songs. Both for $4.99 at this writing. I'm a little pissed about this because guess which one I just purchased? Other than that, the album is ok, but I'm disappointed in the amount of autotune in it. They have more talent than that! It's definitely not Songs About Jane. That album made me a fan. I own the rest of their albums also. Each one I like a little less than the last. This may be the last one I purchase, if they keep going down this path.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Great anime movie from 1984.  I remember watching this for the first time on a long family trip in a Toyota van with a small TV and VCR.  My imagination took off then while watching this movie which has heart and feeling.  It has villains you would despise and heroes you would love.  Even characters that are neither go nor bad.  Wonderful movie.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Get game for problem solving. Also lets you spend some time just goofy off. Especially in between classes. A must to download if you like puzzles.
B007VYQ6DS|4.0|This is another in a series of Disney Nature films, this one focusing on chimpanzees. Specifically, a youngster named Oscar who sees his extended family fend off competitors, while he tries to learn the ways of the jungle. This is the usual kid-friendly fare that adults will also find entertaining that Disney has released each of the last few years at this time. They are able to find a storyline while filming these wild creatures, and also capture some amazing footage while doing it. The narration provides a few light moments, and it is amazing how these wild animals are so similar to humans in their efforts to raise their young and to protect territory. Educational and entertaining, this is a good movie to see with the kids.
B0010SKSTO|5.0|This book provides a very good review of body language cues and their possible interpretations.  The author's references are particularly good, for example citing Jaak Panksepp, John Gottman, and Ekman.  In addition, the author avoids being contrived or trendy by staying true to his neurobiological, physiological, and psychological theoretical orientation.  He is not deterministic in his approach, rather he helps the reader learn to ponder and be inquisitive about body cues, as opposed to prescribing encyclopedic definitions of associated meanings.  As someone already versed in the neurobiology and psychology of body language the book, while sometimes simplistic, offered a helpful and organized layout and review.  The book was exactly what I was looking for in this sense.  For someone who is less versed in these subjects it may be helpful to simultaneously learn more about the limbic system and triune brain to fully appreciate the economical structure of the book.  Although I gave 5 stars, my only critique is that it lacks a colorful narrative.  The book is not exactly a text book to be studied, nor is it an entertaining page turner.  That being said, I personally found the book to be exactly what I was looking for, combining an organized structure with excellent descriptive pictures.
B005LAIHIQ|4.0|In this reprise of an old TV show, a man who is part of a wealthy family is cursed by a jealous lover. He is cast with a spell making him a vampire. He awakens after about 200 years, in 1972. This is a funny movie that features a vampire thrust into a time and culture that he knows nothing about. Johnny Depp is good as Barnabas Collins, and he successfully brings a lot of humor to the film, an early 1700's sensibility transplanted into 1972, and it works quite well. The imagination of director Tim Burton is evident throughout, and you will be entertained by this at times funny, and other times unusual film.
0307352145|4.0|Part of the reason why I love this book so much, at the risk of sounding cheesy, is that it makes me feel like I'm o.k. Until this book, I always thought that there was something wrong with me for being introverted and shy. My purported goal in life as it was always pounded into my head was to come out of my shell. Now I realize it's o.k. and even advantageous to be one of those people who prefers their shell. Of course, I do recognize the need at times to poke my head out and say something. Fine. I accept that. But there's nothing wrong with me for preferring solitude, craving down time and disliking small talk. So I'd like to ask all extroverts running this society to lay off a bit, will ya?<br /><br />I do hope it's not just us bookish introverts reading this book though.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|A group of scientists and crewmembers set out to travel to a distant planet to discover the meaning behind some ancient cave drawings. It is the year 2093 and there may be life present on this remote planet. This prequel to the great 1980 film Alien contains the pre-story to the discovery of the species that terrified the crew of that film. Modern-day expertise has improved the visual capabilities that filmmakers can achieve, which are enhanced further by 3D technology in this film. Unfortunately, Ridley Scott populated this film with characters that you don't get to know well and don't particularly care about, sans one. However, the movie is exciting and visually stimulating enough to make it a worth while film-going experience.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|Wondefful harmonies and wonderful original tunes-- it's like old times with The Beach Boys!!  I'm a long time fan &  it's great to see them back together.  Brian's songs have always been creative and emotional.  Mike's original tune here is also excellent.  If you're a fan or not, you won't go wrong with this cd!
B007TR1R22|2.0|A woman who is having an affair while married to an older man is depressed and suicidal. This is a film that I found dull and not very compelling, to the extent that I slept through some of it. Rachel Weisz is one of the best actresses in Hollywood, but is unable to inject much life into a movie that lacks any interesting drama. This was not a bad film, just one that failed to hold my attention, and is not the most stimulating way to spend your time. Look elsewhere for entertainment.
B005ZUR724|4.0|This game is the best kindle game I have from gameloft!Many great weapons and dungeons never a dull moment.Sometimes I cant put it down....
B005LAIHGI|2.0|The dictator of a fictional nation comes to the U. S., and his trusted assistant attempts to betray him. This comedy features the man known for Borat, and features some fairly distasteful moments. Sacha Baron Cohen has quite a knack for comedy, and as always, he is sometimes off, and sometimes on in this one. There are some real belly laughs in this one, but in between quite a bit of the humor falls flat. Some of the jokes in this movie were actually quite creative and original, but I just felt that too much of the film was trying too hard to find humor where there was none. Overall, I would say there are better ways to spend your movie dollars.
0345803485|1.0|.... I never write reviews.... but it's a good thing I saw my friend's copy of this book and didn't waste money on it.... I too am amazed  this thing is a \\"best seller\\"....
B005LAIHR2|4.0|A young woman leaves Oklahoma to go to Hollywood in search of her dreams. She works at a club where live bands perform, becoming involved with a young man she meets. A rock superstar named Stacee Jaxx is a focal point of the story, as a difficult rock star that makes life complicated for those around him. This musical features fantastic rock music from the mid to late eighties, and is a non-stop good time featuring creative dance numbers, and surprisingly good vocals from the actors. It is certainly a plot we have all seen before, but good singing and dancing, along with likeable actors, inject life into an old storyline. For a rockin' good time, this is one you don't want to miss.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is great love it like no other I'm addicted to it if I say I'm gone stop playing it I just keep going
B005LAIHSG|4.0|An updated telling of the classic Disney tale, with spectacular visual effects, and a truly evil stepmother who uses her magic to terrorized the princess Snow White. This one is aimed purely at adults, with violent fight scenes and a villain who will do whatever is necessary to retain her beauty. This is a very well-told and visually stimulating film that successfully combines the necessary elements of the classic Disney tale with contemporary sensibilities. The movie brings to the screen an action-packed story that will satisfy fans of the original fairy-tale Snow White and also fans of modern cinema.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, you should buy it because I can assure you that you'll love it!  It's clean and very enjoyable for children and adults.  There are so many movies out there yet this is one of three that my three year old grandson chooses as his favorite.  It's a childrens move that you won't feel forced to sit through.  I'm 50 years old and have never said to my grand son, no not that movie again!  I'm willing to watch it over and over.  Trust me, it's good!
B005LAIHMW|4.0|This is a rom-com that features several different couples on their way to parenthood. They all deal with it in a different manner, but all seem to find a way to inject humor into their lives. A strong cast highlights this one, and it does successfully combine good comedy with the drama that relationships always bring, and should keep the audience entertained. There are plenty of attractive people in the cast, providing an appeal for both genders. All in all, I received about what I expected here, a solid movie with beautiful people, laughs, and realistic dramatic moments.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|some of the minigames are kinda expensive and hard but some are addicting and fun. good for passing time. its a good app
B0034G4P26|3.0|A pirate captain who leads a band of misfits attempts to win the pirate of the year award in this Claymation animation film. This is a good movie for the kids, and adults will find laughs present, though hard to come by. The humor just isn't what it needs to be, but the film does enough to be entertaining. There are a few clever lines uttered that you may miss if not paying attention. The Claymation is fun to see, particularly in 3D. Overall, this is a passable movie for adults and certainly one that the children will enjoy.
0156012197|1.0|I really wanted this, but it did not come to me.  Perhaps the fact that my address was listed on several purchases through this site as 153 instead of 152 was to blame.  Sorry!
B005LAIHE0|4.0|A young couple plan on getting married, but life gets in the way. Their relationship gets rocky, as they begin to grow apart. They face a dilemma that is presented by a career opportunity for the woman, which forces the lovers to decide if their planned marriage can proceed. The question on every viewers mind is \\"will they end up together?\\"  Reminiscent of Forgetting Sarah Marshall, though not quite as good, this movie is an entertaining diversion. There are some solid laugh-out-loud moments, and the chemistry between the onscreen actors is apparent. Featuring situations that many modern couples may find familiar, this is a realistic romantic-comedy that will keep you laughing.
B000BNI99K|5.0|This is a very delicious set!  Thank you soooooo much!  I shall enjoy this often with friends or without!  Many moods and rhythms!
B005LAIHYU|4.0|A young Abe Lincoln encounters evil as a boy, and it turns out they are vampires. He goes on a lifelong mission to hunt down the creatures who few realize live among us. He does this while being the President of the United States. This is a violent fantasy that has a bit if fun with the memory of perhaps our greatest president. He is trying to end slavery in this nation, but the vampires have been feeding off of slaves, so this threatens not only their existence, but the continued existence of our nation. You cannot take this one too seriously, yet it is not a campy parody. The serious tone and the ridiculous storyline mesh quite well together to bring us a film that is a welcome diversion. A premise so silly can be forgiven when a movie is this much bloody fun.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Will and Layken... I can't believe a debut author wrote this.  What a great<br />idea!  I hope no one gives it away, but there's an interesting twist<br />roughly a third the way in that will leave you spinning.  I heard there's a<br />book two, going to check it out.  Loved this story. The budding romance,<br />the loss, the obstacles are amazing.  Nothing erotic -  is quite acceptable<br />for older teens.
B005LAIHPE|3.0|A group of Navy ships encounter an alien spacecraft intent on doing bad things to the human race. It is up to surviving crew members to save the world. Loosely based on the classic board game, this action film contains the requisite noise, explosions, and fight scenes one would expect from a summer blockbuster. Don't take this one too seriously, as there are flaws in the storyline. There is certainly nothing new in this one, as it is another mindless action movie that will appeal to its target audience of young men, who will revel in the excitement and the visuals. This is a movie tailored to fans of the action-adventure genre who don't want to be challenged intellectually.
B005ISQ7JM|2.0|More of an editorial opinion piece on the merits of semantic versus presentation focused HTML and content aggregation with references to a few specific features of HTML5.
B0083SBMBM|4.0|The evil brother of Thor opens up a portal allowing alien beings up to no good to wreak havoc upon humankind. A group of superheroes is formed in order to save the planet as we know it. This is the culmination of a series of superhero films and this one features all the main characters, bringing them together, allowing them to use their unique gifts in order to dispose of the bad guys. Bringing all of these alpha males (and one female) together does present its problems, as they at times are competing with each other. However, they are able to put aside any differences and work together for the common good. There are also a few laughs, but the highlights of this one are the spectacular visuals. This is a visually stimulating film that is a solid start to the summer movie season.
B000056K04|1.0|I ordered the cd \\"Everyday\\" and it was packaged as such but when I opened the case, it was an entirely different cd that was enclosed.  Really frustrating experience and a huge oversight on the seller's part.
B005LAII08|4.0|A young princess resists the tradition of being betrothed to a suitor. She is independent minded and wants to pursue her own destiny. She receives an unfortunate spell from a witch and must try to undo it. This is another solid effort in the animated category that combines a compelling storyline with excellent computer animation. The heroine should be someone that little girls will admire and all audiences should find the film quite entertaining. Her beautiful flowing red locks are quite the site to see, and add an element of visual flair to the film. This is a nice animated film for the family to catch.
0440419514|5.0|I can't recommend this trilogy enough for freethinking and humanist teens and adults. I purchased this set after reading the series twice, I'm reading it now for the third time and enjoying it just as much as the 1st two times.<br /><br />If you have seen the movie based an the 1st book, please don't judge the books based on that. The movie was watered down a lot, presumably to try to appeal to a more diverse audience. Like I said, these books are for freethinkers and humanists. And perhaps those interested in humanism, that are skeptical of their faith. The overall message(without being too overbearing about it) is anti-organized religion and dogma. Pullman uses a fantasy theme to do this, with a bit of sci-fi and steampunk thrown in. In a way, it's the anti-thesis to \\"The Chronicles Of Narnia\\", which I also adore, but for different reasons.
B005LAIHQS|3.0|Agents J and K are back, this time dealing with the threat of an alien who has been imprisoned for 40 years and has a score to settle. Will Smith goes back to 1969 and meets the younger version of his partner in order to save him. The usual chemistry is again present and is added to by the presence of Josh Brolin, who is terrific as a young Tommie Lee Jones. The film is uneven at times, but the interesting situation of being placed in a different time period is always fun to watch, as Agent J gets a taste of what it was like to be a person of color in 1969. Though not quite as fun as the original, MIB 3 does provide enough to satisfy fans of the franchise.
B00786XVOG|5.0|music you do not want to miss....<br /><br />  gets you wanting to get up and do things...<br /><br />  well worth the cost
B007L6VR12|4.0|Two young people run away together and are pursued by scout leaders and police. The boy and girl are in love and set out on an unusual journey to be together. This clever comedy has quite a few talented actors in it, and while not laugh-out-loud funny, it does have some witty moments and the film is enhanced by the talent within. I found myself enjoying the journey of these two misfit children who have each found their soul mate, and at times appear to be beyond their years. Overall, this is a smart, funny, well-made comedy that will keep you rooting for the two young people.
B0088P2A7A|4.0|This app is great for folks with inquiring youngsters. It's simple quick and informative, everything's on here. This one is worth checking out.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|A diverse group of senior citizens all travel to India and end up at the same hotel. Not quite the luxury accommodations that were expected, but they try to make the best of it. They all befriend each other, and also learn to appreciate the locals and the culture. This was a well-scripted movie filled with clever dialogue that kept the audience laughing throughout. Most of the cast is likeable and they all have individual problems and stories that you see them working through. Peppered with a veteran cast of actors, this is film is well-acted, well-written, and is a very entertaining film that is geared toward an adult audience.
0439023491|5.0|thanks for sending a replacement book . It got here fast. I really appreciate that you send a replacment after the book got lost in the post office . Thanks !

B007J4T2G8|1.0|The male protagonist is nothing but a sick deviate preying on young innocent girls. He should kill himself before he finds another young girl to deflower with his sick S and M.....I find no saving grace in his person,although the author tries to make him appealing and handsome. He is what he is....a sick sadist ....His species should be crucified not celebrated in a book.. What is the appeal of this book to millions of women who bought it.??????Does it really  titilate? .(someone gave it to me and I was curious to see what the furor was about)  Save your money....and pray your children never meet up with the likes of him.......

B007MDB71O|5.0|I'm truly baffled by the critical response to this movie. It's a fun and sweeping adventure, imaginative and enthralling. We need more movies like this!
B005LAIH5O|5.0|OK, ive seen all Sinbad movies from the past, ive seen lots of stopmotion effects<br />and i do enjoy the good, the bad and even the ugly fantasy science fictions movies<br />that have come my way in the last 40 years. And then this movie comes out with a<br />great trailer...but still some reviewers put in their negative reviews. But i still<br />shell out my money for a blue ray version, brought it home and hoped for the best.<br /> A good movie reviewer, will know within 5 minutes which way the movie will go...up or down. From the first few seconds of the musical score and the opening scenes i felt a winner. And then for the full duration of the movie i had quite a smile.<br />Good costumes...great monsters..great action all the way to the end.<br />Note: glad they had a few deleted scenes...after viewing some of them ...they<br />would have slowed down the movie for sure....
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game it is the funnest game on the Kindle!!! I could play this game all day love it!!!
B005LAII0I|3.0|Not too bad of a job for this fairy tale. Nice colors, great costumes and for once<br />i can hack Julia Roberts as she finally lands a part that she can handled pretty<br />good.  So we have action, colors and lots of things...but it feels so empty...because all scenes were done inside the studios on different stages.<br />Instead of having scenes done outside in the forest, they ended cutting trees<br />down and replanting them on a sound stage... They got away with the first scene<br />in the woods,  then all later scenes felt the same...same fake trees, fake snow<br />fake fake fake.  And all this fake does get to you.

B003LXSY60|5.0|Some fans were put off by 2008's [[ASIN:B001661RC2 ATTACK & RELEASE]]; it was a slight detour for the duo's normal rock-n-roll.  Produced by Brian \\"Danger Mouse\\" Burton, the album added a hip, modern groove to the band's sound.  With Danger Mouse, the Black Keys would receive more widespread attention, but at a cost.  This change in tone alienated some fans, but 2010's BROTHERS is a return to form of sorts.  The electronic influence that swayed the direction of the previous album is largely gone, replaced with the band's trademark sound seen in [[ASIN:B001GXTXTO THICKFREAKNESS]].  The result is one of the band's best and most consistent album; it would go on to win 3 Grammy awards.<br /><br />BROTHERS begins with \\"Everlasting Light:\\" a funky, soulful introduction.  The rhythm and percussion of the song is undeniable -- a characteristic that the entire album carries.  It's hard not to bob your head or tap your head to many of these songs.  The instrumental \\"Black Mud\\" highlights the band's blues-rock influences.  While the Black Keys are generally pigeonholed as indie-rock, make no mistake, their brand of music is just as bluesy as those rock groups of the 60's and 70's.  The music is low-fi, fuzzy, funky, and rocking.  The final track \\"These Days,\\" brings a close to the album with a more somber, moody change of pace.<br /><br />At this point, it might sound like the Black Keys are a niche curiosity.  Instead of being an obscure group, the band has found mainstream appeal in their bluesy, middlebrow, brand of rock.  It's not haughty or pretentious.  I would recommend the Black Keys to fans of the blues-rock bands of old (Led Zeppelin, Cream, etc...), but I would also recommend this album to fans who are looking for just a solid rock album.  There's a lot here for everyone to enjoy.  For fans of the Black Keys, BROTHERS stands among their best work and is essential listening.  Standout tracks to sample: \\"Tighten Up,\\" \\"Howlin' for You,\\" and \\"Ten Cent Pistol.\\"  These select songs will you listeners an idea of what to expect from the album.  Great album, highly recommended.lect songs will you listeners an idea of what to expect from the album.  Great album, highly recommended.
B007OAAK0O|4.0|Even though I was and still excited that this concert has finally been released, I am a little disappointed that it truly wasn't EVERYTHING.  I had the honor of being at the first rained out show and remember her singing other songs (Mirror-Mirror) that somehow didn't make it to the DVD.  I remember the song specifically because of the lighting during the bridge that my cousin and I went crazy for.  Other than that I did enjoy this DVD and seeing the full concert the next day that I was unable to attend.  Since it was filmed \\"back in the day\\" you can't really fault them for not adding more content, news clippings and interviews etc.  That would've truly been a walk down memory lane.  it's still worth the price to have in your library, especially if you were there and experienced it first hand.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Urged for weeks by my sister to read this novel, I finally picked it up while on holiday in the UK and France. Five days later I finished it, which is impressive given all the activities that kept me away from reading during that time. Needless to say, 11/22/63 was engrossing and is an amazing work that grabs hold of you in the first pages and takes you on a time-travelling adventure involving indelible characters parading around key events in world's past -- namely the assignation of JFK. As a writer I was swearing King's name chapter after chapter because of his unparalleled talent at juggling characters, creating vivid worlds, and drawing out drama and tension to the Nth degree. I hate him for that (jealousy) and love him for that (appreciation) at the same time. I'd hate to give away any of the plot or twists. In fact, I won't. All I will do is highly recommend it to you. When you have the time for its 800+ pages, pick it up -- a few days later, you'll be wishing it was 200 pages longer (in a good way).
0891419063|5.0|Eugene Sledge's work makes me wish there were a higer rating than a mere five star. The writing is clear as spring water and the author does not flinch. I also wish that reading such raw memoirs would be required for men who send young men to war. The author strips the glory away and leaves the gore and filth of real war for us to behold. In my opinion Eugene Sledge deserves a medal for the agony of soul he must have endured in this labor. He could not have done it for his own glory.He shows himself in a no-nonsense manner, without the slightest hint of boasting, giving credit to others when it is due. He is also not afraid to blame culpable parties, even if they are senior commanders. In summary, there is not enough that I could say that is good about this book. It is an excellently written work that should be read by every officer candidate and every candidate that seeks an office high enough that it maght place him in the position of having men's lives in his hands. You will hardly be able to put this book down, it is that good.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I really don't write bad reviews for books. I try my hardest to find good things to comment about them but this book was just ridiculous. The main character Anastasia is like Bella basically. She's soooo ordinary and then this incredible hot and rich guy just happens to want her. The sick part about this book is how domineering and controlling he is. This is where it is disturbing for me because I don't understand why women would love this so much. He goes as far as beating her with a paddle until she's balling and leaves him but then comes back for more? It's like this book is encouraging a man to be the dominate one in the relationship and saying it's okay for a guy to be psychotically controlling. But you know how these stories go, she wants to \\"fix\\" him because he is so messed up. I'm sorry but I don't feel bad for the guy even though the author tries to make us. How he treats women in this book is that he is the dominate and they are the passive meaning they have to obey him or they get beat. Seriously? How is this okay? Well yeah she does \\"fix\\" him and he falls in love with her blah blah blah. Okay now about the sex in this book. It's basically like a really kinky weird porno book and its 90% of what you read. I can read some good steamy loves scenes but when he's like sniffing her pubic hair and pulling at it for me that's just disgusting. In this day and age people shave for crying out loud. I read A LOT of book and I just seriously don't understand why everyone loves this one when it's gross and disturbing. I wouldn't waste your money on this book let alone the series. Everyone was going on and on about how great this book was and I seriously tried to like it but it's just too much.
B007SGM084|1.0|Um, buying all three as a bundle is actually 2 cents more expensive than buying them separately.  Isn't the point of bundling the trilogy to make an incentive for people to buy it?  Come on guys.
B005K17RU0|4.0|this app has proven to be quite handy and convenient! No need to wait for the tv news to plan my day.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love how its not just a Bible, their are many other things available like taking notes, and other stuff. its amazing
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It seemed like a typical paper back romance novel.  I don't see what all the excitement is over this particular romance.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Wow this book is a must read for every woman , I in joyed every moment of it. This book had a little of every thing. I bough all of the books, you just have to because you don't want the story to end, it's just that good.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|The first half of this movie is pure comedy gold which eventually devolves into the same genre it's mocking.  That did not bother me at all. I loved the movie, and you will too.
B0086700CM|4.0|I love this game and it is berg addictive, but the same thing over and over again does get boring. Temple Run would be perfect if it had some more boards or alittle variety :)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like that u can keep playing and u don't get bored cause u have to unlock game by game
B006R8GK2Q|1.0|In a game where the goal is to find specific items, it's a little ridiculous to assign objects not present in the room. Don't tell me to find a flute and expect me to choose the clarinet. Don't tell me to find a cup in a room with more than one cup and expect me to know which one I'm supposed to choose!
0307454568|5.0|I must say that this trilogy, the Millennium Trilogy, is one of the best I have ever read. All 3 books are so gripping that they kept me awake until the early hours of the morning. I simply could not put it down. This one was the most thrilling because it showed the point of view of all important characters, whether it is Erica Berger's hassle at work, Lisbeth Salander's time in the hospital and the trial, or Mikael Blomkvist helping Salander clear her name. Every perspective offers new thrills and bring shivers to my bones! This book, as well as The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and The Girl Who Played With Fire, are must haves for your library. You will not regret it! The only downside is that you will be on your knees, begging for the sequel that will never come!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This movie was wonderful.  As I am not a senior citizen, I find some of the reviews that suggest that you somehow need to be elderly to enjoy this film rather amusing.  Perhaps it might help if you've lived a little bit to understand that life doesn't always turn out the way you think it should, and surprising turns can happen at any age.  The characters were all charming, and so too was how they interacted with each other.  The humor was delightful... very dry.  Some of it was so brilliantly subtle that I noticed in the theater there was a delay between the joke and the laughter, because it took a few seconds to sink in.  Overall, this movie was inspired, and hopeful.  I loved it.  (P.S. My mother also saw the film and she described it as \\"perfection.\\")
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great game!  The app works great.  Cards move easily at a tap and the stacks of cards are easy to grab and move where you want them.
B007Y6OZE0|5.0|Fans hoping for the old school-style Offspring may find some trouble liking this album, at first, as I did. However, its selfish to wish for another Americana, and good bands shouldn't be a one-trick pony.<br /><br />Days Go By features an aging Offspring showcasing their diverse ability. Its got ballads, punk, alt rock, funk, ska all mixed into one album. Which to me, is better than every track sounding the same.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into details about all the tracks, because others already have. However I will say that the 2 that stood out most to me are OC Guns and Cruising California. That's because these sound very different from what you would expect from the band. I actually enjoyed them the most my first time playing the CD.<br /><br />Cruising California is a very fun track. It manages to be something fresh, while sounding like an 80s throwback song. Kind of a similar style to Video Killed The Radio Star. It's a great track to blast while cruising down the highway on a hot summer day. Which makes sense, given the track's title.<br /><br />OC Guns was also a different approach, and feels like an homage to Sublime. Another fun track that I find very addicting.<br /><br />All in all, a good, well rounded album. Americana remains my favorite Offspring album, but Days Go By is now my second favorite. You can tell the guys put some creative thought and time into making this album. 4.5/5.

B0050SYS5A|2.0|As one of many people who were disappointed by the airplane hanger like space that is needed to use the Kinect the way it is intended, I was excited for this product and really wanted it to work.  Unfortunately, the zoom rendered the Kinect useless.  Not only could I not calibrate the Kinect with the zoom on to see my entire body, but it made hand gestures jerky and erratic.

0060168366|5.0|Paul Bede Johnson (born 1928) is an English journalist, popular historian, and author; he has also written books such as [[ASIN:1441746714 A History of Christianity]], [[ASIN:B000UE09ZC A history of the Jews]], [[ASIN:B001N4PY9Y Intellectuals]], and [[ASIN:0060935502 Modern Times  Revised Edition: The World from the Twenties to the Nineties (Perennial Classics)]].<br /><br />He notes early on that &#34;This belief in divine appointment was to become an important factor in American as well as English history... At the origin of the myth was the widely held belief that the Christian faith had been brought to Britain directly by Joseph of Arimathea, on the express instructions of the Apostles.&#34; (Pg. 10) In the colonies, he recouts, &#34;Individualism did assert itself... Potential settlers were warned they would have to depend on their own skills.&#34; (Pg. 68)<br /><br />He emphasizes that &#34;England never had a written constitution... All the English had were precedents... Written constitutions were subsequently adopted by all the colonies. It is vital to grasp this point. It was the constitutions as much as the assemblies themselves which made the colonies unique.&#34; (Pg. 104-105) He later observes, &#34;The essential difference between the American Revolution and the French Revolution is that the American Revolution, in its origins, was a religious event, whereas the French Revolution was an anti-religious event.&#34; (Pg. 117)<br /><br />He suggests that the words 'slave' and 'slavery' were deliberately excluded from the Constitution, because &#34;As Madison himself said... it would be wrong 'to admit in the Constitution the idea that there would be property in men.'&#34; (Pg. 188) He notes that &#34;There is no doubt that if the United States Constitution had been drawn up in 1687 it would have had a religious framework... (but) the actual language of the Constitution reflects the spirit of its time, which was secular.&#34; (Pg. 205) Later, he adds, &#34;The wall of separation between church and state, then, if it existed at all, was... between the federal government and the states.&#34; (Pg. 211)<br /><br />He notes, &#34;It is a notable fact that whereas Americans took naturally to capitalism, which places the whole stress on individual effort, they have been markedly inept at creating and sustaining trade unions, which demand that men subordinate their individuality to the collective interest.&#34; (Pg. 566)<br /><br />One need not agree with ALL of Johnson's conclusions to appreciate this very readable and engaging history.The wall of separation between church and state, then, if it existed at all, was... between the federal government and the states.&#34; (Pg. 211)<br /><br />He notes, &#34;It is a notable fact that whereas Americans took naturally to capitalism, which places the whole stress on individual effort, they have been markedly inept at creating and sustaining trade unions, which demand that men subordinate their individuality to the collective interest.&#34; (Pg. 566)<br /><br />One need not agree with ALL of Johnson's conclusions to appreciate this very readable and engaging history.
B008FC4WA4|5.0|Nick Hornby has made a career out of writing about the failures, idiosyncrasies, and even occasional charms of the contemporary male--his obsessive fandom, devotion to pornography, and cluelessness about women and children. This story disrobes a particularly downtrodden British male who takes it (his ex-wife's contempt) like, well, a man.
B007JM4CWY|3.0|UPDATE: I've taken away a couple of stars because there hasn't been an update since February. It's still my favorite game, but we need some more puzzles. Getting kind of tired of the same old ones.<br /><br />probably my favorite game. makes you think, and there's a sense of accomplishment when you finish a puzzle. tutorial is not the best, but I was able to catch on with few problems.
0740797719|5.0|I am a senior in art college.  Of course, the principles of design are drilled into our heads; so, we become quite skilled at line, value, composition, form and color theory.  However, one topic that is greatly lacking is LIGHTING!  I would love to have a lecture on just lighting and how light affects various objects.  Unfortunately, this not dicussed from a painter's point-of-view.  I watch tons upon heaps upon mountains of online tutorials and read an equivalent amount of literature; they all seem to skim over or ignore explanations of lighting all together.  I know all about lighting setups: cameo, 45 degree, fill lights, etc., but not how to render it with color.  It was greatly affecting my work.<br /><br />Recently, I was working on my portfolio for a portfolio class.  I had everything down, but my lighting sucked and I knew it.  I stumbled arcoss this book, having never heard of James Gurney (kicking myself). The book arrived two days later.  I spent about an hour or two skimming the book, focusing on the areas where I needed help and I can tell you that my art improved by 50% once I grasped the concept of lighting and shadow.  It is an incredibly comprehensive book; it literally answered every question I had, things my professors couldn't (or wouldn't) explain and clarified many misunderstandings I had about color theory.  It is a wonderful book.  It does not sit on my bookshelf, but goes with me wherever I go.  I am one of those people who walks with my sketchbook, pens and either a figure drawing book or an anatomy book and takes every opportunity I get to draw and sketch.  Well, I have added one more companion, James Gurney's Color & Light.<br /><br />I can't speak for pros, as I am not one, but if you are a novice painter or draftsman like me, using traditional media or digital, you WILL benefit from this book.  Not to mention, Gurney's artwork is nothing short of AMAZING!
B0086QS7N2|5.0|Not quite as good as some of the old stuff but still very, very good. What makes it even better is my new found appreciation for \\"older\\" music. It seems 99% of new music today blows chunks so a quality band like Rush looks even better than they should! Heck they could beat on a trash can and sound better than the top 40 :)
B004YOEFG8|5.0|This is a great awe inspiring show about how nasa saved the Hubble Space telescope. It's not about the findings or the things it shot in space very much. It's impressive and beautiful. The picture is perfect on blu ray 3d and the narration is excellent by LEonardo D c. It has webisodes for extras and you get a good sense of how hard it was to save the telescope. It does wet my appetite for more footage of the actual deep space findings of the telescope though.  If you KNOW what this is then you Wont be disapointed.

B007SGM084|1.0|I downloaded the Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy without sampling first. Big mistake. The book is like watching a porn movie. After the first 10 minutes you're pretty much over it. If you  were to exclude the sex the entire trilogy could be written in 3 short chapters.  So if you want a book with a decent story line, read something else. If you want a book with very repetitive sex scenes, go ahead and read it.
0439023521|5.0|Very happy with the service and quality.  Book is in great condition.  Very satisfied with the packaging, condition of book and the quick delivery.  Definitely will look to purchase again.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was a skeptic... did not usually read books of this nature. BUT I was captured from chapter one and was never once bored throughout the story. GREAT READ
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|the dialogue is a little cheesy but it's a great game!  well designed....love the artsy artifacts. might have to check out their other games...
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|this book was good, but very slow paced and somewhat confusing. i found myself skipping to more exciting, action filled parts of the book.
B000ICPJOM|3.0|I hate commercials but I almost would rather have them than just a black screen.  This is pretty silly.  At each commercial junction the screen goes black and lasts for a few minutes.  Then the story pops up again until the next time.  Stargate Atlantis isn't the best sci-fi show ever but it's entertaining enough the first time you watch it.  I really can't recommend the streaming here though.  Maybe Netflix plays straight through.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun! This game has been so much fun for both the kids and us! It has become a fun Summer addiction.
B005K17RU0|5.0|got my new Kindle Fire and need weather app I found it and used it and loved it. No trouble at all.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|I am loving this game although it would be more fun if I could hear the dialogs instead of reading them.
B005LAIH5O|4.0|Wrath of the Titans was a better, more energetic sequel. The action is almost non-stop, the pace is very fast. The plot is worked for me. But it's the weakest part. Since the pace was so fast not much time is spent on character development. Perseus is maybe the only character that had any. The new actress playing Androma felt better, and the new Demi-God was entertaining. The acting was surprisingly good form the whole cast. The CGI is amazing. There is a maze sequence that is mind blowing. And every creature was fun. Overall I highly enjoyed Wrath more than clash. It's a mindless fun actin movie that I think people will like more than Clash of the Titans.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|free and easy to use especially if you need to add your basic things. easy to read as well. I like it
B005V2S7FW|5.0|My brother recommended LastPass to me one day when I was complaining about not being able to remember all the various passwords I was using.  He indicated I would only have to remember 1 account and all others would be stored.  This is correct.  It will also generate highly secure passwords for new accounts.  I am so grateful not to have to remember all these various log-in codes and passwords any longer.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it was ok but doesn't really explain the games. I enjoy some games but after a while it became boring and there were no games I wanted to play. They should have put names of the games in the description. I'm glad it was free.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun game at first but it gets a little boring at the third page trying to come up with over 180k points just to unlock one game.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game! If your ever bored just go to this game and check if any of your friends have played. It's really fun and a great time waster.:)
B001VLBDD0|3.0|There are two disks in the box.  The lower one the catches are broke so most of the time the disk is on it'd own in the box.  Also I think this batch of CD's had their holes cut off center.  I get a lot of vibration while playing them.  Great moive though.

1401235417|5.0|Shadowhawk reviews the first 10 issues of the New 52: Batman series, written by Scott Snyder and published by, well, DC Comics of course!    \\"Startlingly brilliant, New 52: Batman takes you on a dark, philosophical and action-packed journey through the psyche of the Great Detective and the city he loves so much. This is Batman and Gotham like never before.\\" ~The Founding Fields    Note: The first six issues are collected as a trade edition under the title: The Court of Owls and this series is currently ongoing.    I've been a fan of Batman for a very long time. As near as I can make out at the moment, at least since 2nd grade when I used to own a couple Batman pencil-boxes (yeah...). In the years since, I've satisfied that Batman-addiction through the various animated shows, a few random comics here and there (Frank Miller played a role here), the animated movies and some of the other stuff now and then. With the exception of the Batman: The Animated Series in which Kevin Conroy voices Batman, and which I hold as the definitive on-screen portrayal of the Great Detective, DC's latest reboot of the character, New 52: Batman, is the one that is definitely going to leave a lasting impression on me. In simple terms, Scott Snyder has done an amazing job with the character and the setting alike, delivering handsomely on my expectations.    I confess that the news of DC revamping all its existing storylines and rebooting pretty much everything largely passed me by. I only saw the initial announcement last year with the accompanying Justice League (?) artwork which I rather liked. I'd never been that interested in comics truth to tell but I'd definitely gone through a phase back in college, which is when I read some of Frank Miller's Batman stuff. Coming back to Batman after all these years, the movies notwithstanding, was seriously a rough trip. In a good way.    I have really fond memories of Batman: The Animated Series and it was inevitable that I'd try to reconcile thosememories with Scott Snyder's take. Since I'm not that much into comics, I didn't really have any preconceptions or expectations other than reading something that wowed me from the first few pages. That's the only thing as I've been reading some pretty spectacular stuff lately and that's what I was going to compare New 52: Batman against.    You know what though? This series is in a class all of its own.    To start with, this really is Batman and Gotham like I've never seen before. I don't remember much of Frank Miller's Batman, but Scott Snyder's Batman can go toe to toe with him and hold his own for sure. The series is grittier and far more serious than any comic I've read. The madness, the self-torture, the angst, the arrogance, its all there aplenty. To take a more recent example, Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight movie is like a picnic compared to New 52: Batman. And that is not an idle comparison. The seriousness and the mature treatment of the subject matter by Scott Snyder is something that I really, really liked. It takes comic books to a whole new level. The only experience that I can say comes close to how I felt after burning through the ten issues no more than two days ago was akin to reading the Crisis of the Infinite Earths crossover event back in 1985, DC's first major attempt to resolve all its (often) conflicting storylines, a result of the whole multiple Earths issue. When all the superheroes, and the supervillains, are fighting tooth-and-nail for their very existence is the imagery I came up with when reading these ten issues.    It all left me rather breathless and exhilarated in equal measure.    You can find the full review over at The Founding Fields:    [...]

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Entertaining, fast read. Made me want to continue the story so jumped into the sequel immediately!EL James did an excellent job of blending erotic with suspense.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The games are simple and fun. As others have mentioned it gets tedious to unlock games later on due to very high cost and low point rewards for completed games.

0345803493|1.0|Uuughh, this is even worst than the first book! It´s so boring, so repetitive, and even when they´re having sex at least twice dialy,  the scenes are so dull, I was just flipping through them. There are so many things going on, but at the same time, nothing happens! There are many situations that could´ve made this an interesting book, the crazy exsub, the harrassing boss, Kate finding out about their contract, but since Christian is oh so almighty, they just ended up really quickly, without really affecting the story. I don´t even want to go into their relationship, which is just sick. Seriously, don´t waist your time with this one.

B003VANOFY|2.0|I purchased this back in April of 2011, and within minutes of connecting it, was amazed at the phenomenal sound quality.  Movies were rich and crisp, and stereo was clear and defined.  It was a match made in heaven, and my ears were the luckiest they've ever been.<br />Fast forward to April 2012.  The headset still has amazing quality but now suffers from the occasional random disconnect.  No biggie, it's only once every few hours for only a second or two.<br />May 2012 - The disconnects have now become commonplace, sometimes happening multiple times per minute.  After searching online, I discover that apparently this is a very well known issue with this headset.  People have been complaining about this specific issue for years.<br />6/14/12 - I go through the proper procedure and am successful in retrieving an RMA ticket, where they will pay for postage to take my old headset and replace it with a Brand New one.<br />6/29/12 - I just received my new headset last night and used it for the night.  Amazing quality, truly missed its absence.  I wake up this morning and begin to listen to Spotify, when about 10 minutes pass I get the most ear-splitting, horrid noise I've ever heard.  At first I thought it was some rogue sound process on my computer, so I begin shutting everything down.  After the sound goes away, I realize that the headset will no longer stay connected.  It connects for about 2 - 3 seconds, and then drops.  Nothing I do, no amount of reinstalling, resetting the transmitter, moving USB, changing computers, nothing fixes the issue.<br />After 30 minutes on customer support, they're issuing me a new RMA.  For a headset I had less than 24 hours.<br />It's a shame this headset suffers from poor internals, otherwise it's comfortable and sounds great.<br />After the experiences I've had, I've gone ahead and purchased another headset (NOT Logitech) and will eventually receive a refund when this next pair break.
B001H5X7I4|5.0|Tropic Thunder shipped swiftly through an Amazon reseller, and is the silliest motion picture I have yet viewed.  Thus, a 5-stars accomplishment of Ben Stiller and crew.<br /><br />Please note that The Set-Up (1949):<br /><br />\\"This riveting, gut-punching boxing picture plays out in something close to \\"real time.\\" We are locked in with an over-the-hill pug (Robert Ryan) as he arrives at an arena for a match against a younger opponent. What he doesn't know yet is that his crooked manager has agreed to throw the fight for some gangsters--so Ryan has more than one battle on his hands as each bruising round goes by. At a lean, mean 72 minutes, The Set-Up manages to load the essential film noir themes into one potent package, excitingly delivered with no breathing room. Director Robert Wise would go on to make such mega-productions as The Sound of Music, which only makes you appreciate his economy here. And the movie's a fine showcase for tall, craggy Robert Ryan, one of the great under-sung actors in American movies, who was a boxer himself before becoming an actor. --Robert Horton<br />[Amazon review]<br /><br />is regarded by many as the finest film to date.<br /><br />Thus, The Set-Up, Tropic Thunder, some three hours viewing over an evening, bracketing the film expererience.<br />Clint Williams
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy playing this version as it is the classic solitaire we all know and love.  I also have the option of starting with a random deal or one that I know I can win as long as I play it right. Nice job.  The only change would be an option to take 1 card or 3 on the turn.
B000FC12C8|4.0|This book contains classic content on the difference between investing and speculating - profiting from rather than getting burned by the variance in the market - and being conservative.  It also hammers home the message in both the text and the commentary that outperforming the market is no easy task.  My gripe is with some of the commentary.  Zweig exaggerates to make his point.  He asserts that the market's pricing errors are rare when they are really a daily occurrence - and when trying to dissuade the reader from writing covered calls he claims it is never a good idea.  A derivative is like any other investment in that it can be mispriced and can therefore yield an exceptional risk-adjusted return.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is amazing. I have heard so many good reviews about it but I didn't 100 % believe them but once I got the game I have fell in love with it and its honestly so fun and relaxing yet it will get ur heart pumping. I don't see the point of using the cheat cud I would rather just play the game but on tutorial if u swipe right twice u get a cheat and run forever which seems pointless.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|amazing game,  love it! add me kfire00 I also play bakery story, fashion story, nightclub story. I think everyone should get this app and at least try it once but be warned you will be hooked Lol :) ;)

0307887448|5.0|Ready Player One is by far one of my favorite books of all times. I was a kid in the 80's - raised on Super Mario Bros, The Legend of Zelda, Back to the Future and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I found Ready Player One after hearing that Wil Wheaton had voiced the audio book, and while I wasn't sure about the book itself, I downloaded a copy from Audible thinking it would be entertaining to listen to Wheaton's narration while sitting at my desk at work. Needless to say, I was wonderfully surprised by this novel... the characters were well built, the story engrossing, and the 80's pop culture references gave me flash backs to my childhood as well as a few new movies to add to my Netflix queue. Wheaton's voice was expressive, changing with each character, portraying surprise, anger, sadness... whichever the story called for... making the \\"movie\\" in my head that much more realistic. I found it nearly impossible to tear myself away, listening not just at the office, but also in the car on my ride home and even when I could sneak in some free time in the evenings. I didn't notice any long, drawn out, unnecessary explanations, the writer hooked me right away and the pace never slowed until the final sentence was delivered. I will be keeping an eye on this author for certain, hoping for a sequel or an entirely new story. Until then, here's hoping someone picks up the movie rights soon!
B0086700CM|5.0|OMG this game is so fun!!!  My teacher got this game on ower ipods.  So now I have it on my kindle fire :{D

B005EHILV4|5.0|Hi.<br /><br />I bought this mixer, I waited some middle quality, noisy thing, as price is really small.<br />But I get a very good, quality mixer. Tryed it with dinamic and condenser microphones - sound is really crystal clear and good. Also integrated sound card appeared to be rather good, low latency and perfect sound.<br /><br />The only minuses (but it is a normal for this price) that microphone goes directly to main mux, and can't be disconnected. And the second is that recording is taken from main mix.<br /><br />So as I needed it to use with pc as voice processor for microphone, used soldering iron, two 5 volt relays and one switch, and got really cool thing ;) Now I can record only voice or main mix, and when turned to capture mic only - I pass it through effects in software and putting it back to mixer :)<br /><br />Really great thing, great quality. Inside PCB is also made very good and acurate.<br /><br />P.S. Think some users got noise, when powered from usb, because of bad power supply in their pc. I tryed on 2 laptops - no noise. Yes, of cource there is small level of self noice, but it is even less than RME DIGI 96/8 PAD has, so that's a really good result!
B007SGM084|5.0|This is without a doubt the best love story I have ever read!!!  I had never heard of the books when a friend said \\"you have to read these books\\".  That night (it was a Friday) I downloaded the trilogy to my kindle.  By Sunday night I had read all three.<br />The story is so compelling.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good love story, but, I recommend that you purchase all three books at once because once you get started, you can not put it down and you would be greatly disappointed to get to the end of Fifty Shades of Grey and not have Fifty Shades Darker to roll right into and so on.<br />This is a story of a love so profound that it is life changing for both of the characters.  It is wonderful to see how far both Christian and Anastasia have grown with this relationship.  I  laughed, I cried, literally sobbed (and more than once).  This is a wonderful series which I have already read twice and would read again.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The \\"Grey\\" series of books by Alexis Stanton are fun reads, especially if you enjoy your sexuality as a person. The writing is quite good, very readable, and the character development of Christian Grey throughout the series is nicely articulated. It has stirred up quite a readership as I hear, and filled with the lusty sexual encounters that permeate the books it is easy to see just why. It's a good primer for those sexually underdeveloped, and provides interesting insight into the world of dominant-submissive relationships including sado-masochism. The very sensitive reader may find it coarse and crude, but those of us that enjoy the visceral emotional and physical qualities of a passionate relationship will find it stimulating and compelling. For me, it's somewhere between a 4 and 5 star rating.
B004Y12S9W|5.0|I connected my iPad2 with this device via an HDMI cable to my hi-def TV, and it worked without problems. I also connected the iPad2's power adapter, so that it would recharge the battery. All connections worked just fine.
0307592731|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and couldn't put in down! I was sorry when it ended it had kept me so enthralled! The real-life adventure of this initially unprepared woman is an inspiration and a journey for the reader as well as the author. Most readers will probably never hike the Pacific Crest Trail, but this book gives a taste of the experience without the very difficult reality to contend with. Best read in a favorite chair surrounded by all the comforts - you'll appreciate them all the more while reading this book. The writing is evocative, thoughtful, and poignant while paced like a thriller and is much more than a travelogue - it's a spiritual journey as well - a pilgrimage, as all great journeys are. The author's deeper destination/goal is ultimately herself. It almost made me want to strap on my hiking boots and give it a try! Highly recommended.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this book because of all the hype.  My mistake.  I was only able to get through half of the book and finally gave up.  I've seen better writing and character development from high school students.

0545123275|3.0|There is so much to say about this book. I actually did not finish the book; I felt I shouldn't.<br /><br />Not because of the plot. It was excellent and plausible in a sci-fi way. The characters were also completely realistic and I identified with many of their situations. The author is a talented writer. The way that she describes places and the emotions that the characters felt are incredible. I don't know if when the book series becomes a movie series, which I'm sure it will, all of the author's descriptions can even be shown as effectively as the author wrote them out.<br /><br />No, for me the problem was in the emotions the story evoked in me. Usually, it is a wonderful thing to be able to connect with a story and feel what the characters are feeling. This story, however, filled me with despair and a sadness that I could not shake. I was overwhelmed with a depression for the characters and the overall sorrow they carried with them. The problem I have with this book, is that it's being promoted for ages 12 and up. I don't know if teenagers with all the hormones and angst, and imaginations that they carry can read a book like this and not be affected. Will they be able to compartmentalize the book and separate it from their reality? Maybe, it's just me being an old lady at age 41 and I don't \\"get it.\\" Whatever.<br /><br />This is not a book I will be giving to my 11, soon to be 12 year old daughter, but hope that others that do read it and enjoy it will not be affected like it did me.<br /><br />Scholastic sent me the above book for review purposes. It will allow me to keep the book. I have no other connection to and have received no other compensation from Scholastic Books.

B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I really enjoyed this game! The difficulty level was good, the storyline flowed and the length was good. The story indicted when it was almost over so I wasn't surprised by an abrupt ending. One note:<br />&quot;align&quot; means &quot;get the strings to cross over the gems and nowhere else&quot;
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its an interesting game and a little addictive. I wish u get more points to buy more games for each game you play.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hunger Gamesis an outstanding book!I loved every second of it and the book always had me on the edge of my seat,with the twists and turns.If you like death-defeying  adventures Hunger Games is definately for you.But,if you do not like death-defeying adventures,but you love romance this book is also for you. Even if you do not like any of these things,Hunger Games is an amazing book and it is totally worth spending some money. So…what are you wating for?!?Stop reading these reviews and go buy the Hunger Games!!!Trust me this book is totally…OUTSTANDING,INCREDIBLE & FANTASTIC!!!!
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Definitely a great game if you like hidden objects. The graphics are solid, and at least on Kindle Fire the touch controls are very accurate. A solid game and one of the best in the store for this genre.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|The game is easy enough for most anybody to play. Graphics are pretty good and controls seem to react correctly.
0307716546|5.0|After reading some of the reviews, which lauded it but made it sound a bit contrived, I was prepared to give [[ASIN:0307716546 Afterwards: A Novel]] fifty pages, then toss it in my trade-in pile. At one a.m., I staggered to bed.I genuinely could not stop reading, I almost called a friend to tell her about it then realized it was almost midnight at the time. This book is incredibly well written and forget 50 pages, I was hooked almost immediately and I really did start reading with a negative attitude.  The whole out of body narrative approach sounded hokey, the setup contrived -- both worked wonderfully. I understood Grace and Jenny, ached for Adam, and loved Sarah, who for me, was incredibly real and vivid. Mike was a little more vague in my mind but I devoured the story, followed all the reasoning and was anxious to reach the end. It was frustrating to be with Grace and Jenny as they discovered things but couldn't communicate them, I knew the red herring was a red herring without knowing why, figured a few twists out, then was shocked by one announcement while wondering why I didnt see the other one earlier. Loved it and ordered [[ASIN:030771652X Sister: A Novel]] as soon as I got up.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|This is a well done hidden object game that injects some variety to the formula including locating objects from a specific name, a silhouette, a general category (find all clocks, etc...), or spot the differences between two nearly identical pictures.  The pictures are clear on my 10.1&quot; Galaxy Tab, but may be cluttered on smaller screens.  However, it does offer a pinch and zoom feature, so this may not be a problem.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|This is a remake as well as a prequel to Alien franchise. It will leave you with nothing just to lead you to the remake of Alien. All together visually stunning, Ridley Scott is a well known visual director. F.Y.I original concept to Alien is invovled.
B007UQ5Z1G|1.0|You get what you pay for?  I'd pay $50 for a LP CD that actually rocked.  People liked LP because their sound was loud and aggressive.  No longer!  Chester & The Gang not pissed off enough anymore?  Fame and fortune made them too soft to make hard music?  I think they still have the potential for more, but need to get back to basics again.<br /><br />edit 7/7/12<br />So I listened to the CD again.  Weak.  Even the stuff where they try to rock it just falls flat.  To all those that say \\"Give up on Hybrid Theory/Meteora.  That's the past.  They changed.\\" so...<br /><br />1) I don't listen to their old, heavier stuff anymore because IT'S OLD.  I don't need/want to play their old songs anymore.  I listen to NEW music.  I want NEW music.<br />2) Just because they \\"changed; grew as artists (LOL)\\" means suddenly MY music tastes have to change as well to exactly what they are putting out now???  I like a lot of music and this doesn't do it for me (or many others).<br />3) I really like progressive/trance/electro/EDM/etc.  I like it's use use in music and have nothing against LP having this sound, so my review isn't biased against this.
0385342063|4.0|Poppy is a fun-loving character that just wants to make others happy. When she loses her engagement ring and her phone in the same day, the world feels like it crashing down around her. Luckily she finds a spare phone in the trash bin to use until she recovers her ring. From there she life takes on a whirl wind of text messages and e-mails that lead to some unexpected results.<br /><br />Well, at least the results are unexpected for Poppy but pretty predictable for the reader. At least, those results were predictable to me but that didn't stop me from enjoy this light hearted book. Poppy was a fun character that once in a while seems a little like she should be a space cadet but then she does something at odds with the \\"space cadet\\" idea and you realize she isn't a space cadet at all. I enjoy the development of this novel and though it was a quick and fun read. 4 Stars.

1439153663|1.0|What a disappointing waste of time. This was poorly written and the characters not properly developed. I couldn't finish it and stopped after reading 20%. Don't waste your time unless you aren't bothered by historical inaccuracies and really enjoy overwrought soap operas. It's an insult to compare this to \\"The Help\\".<br /><br />Update:<br />I finished the book; I hate leaving things incomplete. It's still overwrought, but additionally incredibly depressing with the neverending string of calamities that befall the characters often due to miscommunication and stupidity.

B007MDB71O|2.0|John Carter is (loosely) based on the Edgar Rice Burroughs Mars (Barsoom) series. It is the story of a Civil War veteran who dies and magically appears on Mars (no explanation needed, although the film felt it wise to add a ridiculous supernatural element to explain the phenomenon). There he is captured by a green alien race called the Tharks. In the book, he wins their respect with his jumping abilities and his battle skills. In the movie, he simply escapes them (possibly because the filmmakers did not want to deal with the intricacies of the foreign culture and the relationship developments). The Tharks have also captured Dejah Thoris (who in the movie basically gives herself to them because she doesn't want to get married) and Carter falls in love with her. He aligns himself with her to save her native city called Helium.<br /><br />Aside from the adaptation problems, I was disappointed by how much the filmmakers relied on sci-fi cliches to keep the plot moving. Is making a strong woman reject her fiancee the only way to illustrate that she is strong? Is torturing a member of another race the only way to make an audience care for them? Are lame jokes about the aliens mistaking Carter's hometown of Virginia as his name really necessary? The cliches made the film watchable, but nowhere near remarkable. So much has been changed from the classic novel, that I just got more and more frustrated the more I watched.<br /><br />I much prefer the old fashioned straight-forwardness of the book. In it, Carter falls in love with Dejah Thoris at first sight, and although she is strong-willed, she is a captive and therefore helpless and able to be saved. The strong male-oriented sense of adventure is somewhat present in the movie, but it is overshadowed by convoluted additions to the plot. The platonic relationships between Carter and Sola and Tars Tarkas are completely glossed over, which is probably the most frustrating loss in the translation from page to screen. The overall theme of combativeness vs. peacefulness is completely lost.<br /><br />The marketing for this film was horrible. While the film cost millions of dollars to make, the studio did very little advertising, and the trailers I saw didn't give any hints at the story. It wasn't until later that I found out it was based on the Burroughs stories that I had recently discovered. I'll admit that my interest in the book is what brought me to the film, but had it not been for that I would have passed it by.theme of combativeness vs. peacefulness is completely lost.<br /><br />The marketing for this film was horrible.

0345410025|5.0|If you're looking for a great entry level book about improving your memory, this book is a great place to start. This was the first memory book I'd ever read and I was amazed at how easy and effective the methods are. This book is fun to read, easy to understand and the techniques are simple to learn and to apply. There is some debate as to who should be credited with the various methods used and explained by the authors of this book. However, to me, it doesn't matter who gets the credit. They work! These methods are easy to learn, easy to use and they are very effective. To me, this purchase was well worth the money.
6310292196|5.0|Just a heads up for those who, like me, are getting impatient for a Blu-ray release in the United States (c'mon, Sony, this was the Golden Globe Best Pic winner!): I took a shot at ordering the import, stuck it into my Magnavox Wal Mart Cheapie blu-ray player and whaddya know, it works.<br /><br />The picture quality for this blu-ray is stunning in places, and not-so-stunning in other places (a bit soft here and there).  But every second of it is gorgeous compared with the DVD release, which was bad even by SD standards.  But hang on to the DVD for Emma Thompson's witty commentary, because it's not on the blu-ray.<br /><br />This is one of my five favorite films, and I was psyched outta my head to see it look so sharp, so I may not be a level-headed reviewer, but in the parts (about 80% of the run time) where the picture quality is very good, I thought I was looking at one of the best looking movies I'd ever seen.  I saw little facial gestures and nuanced physical acting I hadn't noticed in my umpteen previous viewings on DVD.  The colors of the country-side, the outfits, the foods, the horses, and the decor of the homes, taken altogether in the rhythm and tone that Ang Lee presents here, is a real marvel.  Seeing (and hearing) it on blu-ray, I was swept back to 1995 when I was knocked out by it at the movie theater.  This is an underrated masterpiece in my opinion.  Best chick flick of all time.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|I'm hoping this comes out in a two or three disc version.<br /><br />Charlize is wonderful as the queen, and Kristen plays her part very well.  Chris is such eye candy.  I'm a Twilight fan, but saw the movie in the theater with an open mind.  The costumes are terrific - should get an Academy Award.  I liked that the history of the main characters was fleshed out. The battle scenes could have been a little longer.  I felt myself caring for the characters, including the dwarfs who are NOT named Sleepy, Dopey, Doc, etc.  the visuals were stunning. I passed on Mirror Mirror to see a more adult version of the story.  Glad I saw it, and will add to my DVD colletion.

I'll address some of the criticism here.<br />\\"You can see flashes of the girls' underwear.\\"<br />Use logic, people. They are wearing dresses. They are doing handstands. If you are wearing a dress, it's going to fall down.<br />\\"Mrs. Hannigan was too...\\"<br />Well, I don't know what to say about this. It couldn't be ignored, but I considered it to add to the plot(unlike some movies which just throw it in there), and it wasn't excessive.<br />\\"I didn't like the profanity near the end.\\"<br />I agree. That was completely unnecessary, and the only negative to the movie.<br />\\"There's no widescreen.\\"<br />A valid complaint.

B00004XP35|2.0|There are other people here who have done a good job reviewing the songs on this album... so I won't waste time with that. I will say that I ordered the Vinyl (brand new) of this album and when I received it I noticed that it would skip pretty badly on two different songs. So I submitted an exchange request from Amazon and the second album showed up 2 days later. The replacement record didn't have the same issues on the two original songs, but DOES have a skipping issue on one of the other songs.<br /><br />It seems very strange that 2 out of 2 records that I ordered have this skipping issue, so I am led to believe that they simply did a lazy job creating these records. Shame, as it's a great album with some awesome memories tied to the songs.

B002QKZLZ6|3.0|I have always wanted a belt case for my bluetooth and then when I bought the Plantronics Voyager Pro, it came with a free case! I was so excited! Until after some time I started noticing the flaws in its construction. The closure magnets were mis-aligned right out of the box, and after time the case started to soften & crush like glove leather, not the best protection for my bluetooth. Also, the leather on the beltclip started to peel off making it harder to put on & take off. Overall, nice basic idea & design, but this should have been a hard case not a soft case. I would have liked it better if it was a hard plastic case covered in leather, or at the very least, thicker stronger leather like a weight lifting belt, not like a glove. I hope they or some third party designer comes out with a better alternative soon. Mine is almost unusable.

B00092ZMDY|4.0|I struggled mightily with this review... For me.. its 3-4 stars. But I really WANTED it to be 5.<br /><br />First... I am a HUGE Eagles fan. I grew up with Lyin Eyes and Take it to the limit on 45. The Greatest Hits CD is worn out. I really WANTED to love this DVD... Nuff sed. But...<br /><br />Here is what I like:<br /><br />The play set: Perfect. All the Eagles hits are here. And I especially LOVED the solo songs by Walsh, Frey and Henley (those were actually the hilites for me... You Belong to the City was great... and Life's Been Good stole the show till Desperado.)<br /><br />Life's Beeen Good: The hilite of the show until...<br /><br />Desperado: Henley was AWESOME. Amazed that Frey let him close the show. Henley was spectacular here- my song bias OFC.<br /><br />The horn section: LOVED em.<br /><br />Lyin Eyes: AWESOME. I LMAO. Frey actually had a personality. Great intro to a great song.<br /><br />Here is what I hated:<br /><br />Most of the 1st CD: Walsh was mostly comatose (until In The City). The fans were more into the concert than the performers. (I thought A LOT about this.. I dont think it was the age of the performers. Im guessing it was the song genre.... they are mostly slowish songs but the band has to own this too.)<br /><br />Frey didnt intro the whole band (Walsh, Henley, Bassist)? ORLY?<br /><br />I know that smome people have complained about \\"the unknown bassist\\"... but I thought he was ok. Youth > experience in this case. He helped.<br /><br />Bottom line... Woth buying. I guess I would FF through to the hilites... But this would mostly be a 2nd DVD re-watch for me.
B005LAIGSC|4.0|4.3 stars<br /><br />Denzel should play the bad guy all the time! He's a great good guy, but such a wonderfully semi-evil bad guy in this and Training Day. The big surprise here was Reynolds' quickly improving acting chops. Hanging with the big boys is showing him what real acting looks like, and like his character here he's a quick study. So there's the lesson for all you wanna-be leading men: it's easy, just marry then divorce the hottest actress in Hollyweird while honing your acting, then watch the great roles come rolling in. I think I'll try that out later this year. Anyone got SJ's cell number?<br /><br />This flick has tons of good action and also a very intelligent script that asks many of the right questions about the CIA. It seems to suggest that plenty of the top Agency folks are corrupt at best, which is of course confirmed by so many ex-agents' memoirs. But seeing as the extras (which are quite good, lots of little docs) point out that a 30-year Agency vet did all the details here, you have to wonder, as always in the world of triple agents and daily media deceit, if we're not meant to think the CIA always finds and gets rid of their own bad guys. Uh huh.<br /><br />Which makes the ending all the better, if just for its basic premise: speaking truth to power and doing the right thing trumps patriotism, in any country. Well, this is fiction after all. Gleeson is as usual perfect; this increasingly ubiquitous fellow is the next Michael Caine. But it's Reynolds who really carries this, being in almost every scene, and he looks like the next great all-around leading man at this point.<br />Denzel also has some truly fine moments, including the very disturbing waterboarding scene. Is this what we're fighting for? Nope, just corporate profits, naturally.<br /><br />A very fast, well-made action spy-thriller with good acting and a tight script, Safe House also gets a fine blu-ray transfer, and it looks crisp and real. I think this one will be seen as a genre classic as time goes by.classic as time goes by.
B003UPPO2G|3.0|I bought this product based on reviews from here. Sadly, I was disappointed. What is there is great. But what IS NOT there is also great. Specifically, I was VERY disappointed to see the song list but to see that MANY of my favorites were only played through the 1st verse ie 1/3 through. I kept thinking.. Is that all?? Yes, it was. Why are they stopping now?<br /><br />For me, the playlist was too long... but also too short... I thought that many of the songs should have been off the playlist entirely but many of the other songs should have been played through their entirety...<br /><br />Yea.. I get that the Bee Gees have been around for X decades.... But still.. Look at the songs that were shorted... And look at the OTHER songs..

B006R8GK2Q|4.0|This app is much better than I expected.  I got it on the Fdr app a day and I enjoy it enough that I might buy the next one. However, I don't think it is worth the $4 or $5 price though. I have not found a$4/$5 game yet.
B00002Z88D|5.0|This is such a great CD. I love all of the songs. They are so powerful and unlike anything else. Such great sound for being live, and the orchestra makes everything sound even more intense. If you're a Metallica fan I would definitely recommend getting this CD.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|Although I enjoy the game itself, I don't care too much for the app.  There are all these \\"extras\\" that I know nothing about, such as \\"jumping in\\", which apparently has to be done in half a second, and which I was uanble to accomplish.  I attempted to play a time or two, and wasn't really able to figure it out.  I'm keeping the app for now, and will possibly attempt to figure it out at a later time.
B004X80QNG|1.0|This app is basically worthless on the Kindle Fire. The only calendar option is PI. No option to sync to anything else. Ilove the iPod version of the app but wish I could give this one back!
B0086700CM|5.0|All you people who complain about the glitches and how it freezes when you swipe, go send an error report to IMANGI STUDIOS. What use is it to complain about it to us? Unless you honestly think it is a bad game don't give it a bad review. The problem won't get fixed because we are the ones reading them. Imangi is the one that needs to know this.
B000CNFC76|5.0|If you like golf, you'll like this DVD.  If you like true, heart warming plots, you'll like this DVD.  Excellent production values.
B007NMN2US|5.0|Bought this as a gift. The birthday person loved it. It is a cute key chain. The product arrived on time.
0099579936|1.0|This is by far the worst book I have ever attempted to read. I say \\"attempted\\" because I couldn't finish it. I even tried skimming through and reading just the so-called \\"steamy\\" scenes and I couldn't do it.<br /><br />I find it mind-boggling that this is what passes for exciting erotica and that these books, which are just Twilight fan-fiction with some imaginary S & M thrown in, are so popular. I truly do not get it.<br /><br />The writing is utterly atrocious and the sex scenes are weak. And why does Anastasia keep saying that Christian is bossy? He's supposedly a Dom; isn't that the whole point?!<br /><br />This whole phenomenon makes me angry. Do not buy into the hype. I'm convinced it is a joke someone is playing on us all.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|It was a great book and what a treat to be able to read it on my droid.  Look forward to getting another book to use my kindle app.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I've been a big sudoku fan,but was getting bored with it. This game gives me my number puzzle fix with the added challenge of a little math challenge.  I love it and am totally addicted.
0345803485|4.0|The good:<br />-While the plot was poorly written out, it was an entertaining, and (don't lash out at me, I will explain)an original idea. I know this started as FanFic and should hardly be called original, however I saw nothing of this sort in Twilight. Did anyone else come up with this type of relationship, from Edward and Bella?<br />-The character of Christian was also charmingly, enigmatic. Whether this was on purpose or because of poor character development, he stayed a puzzle I tried to figure out, and I found that fascinating.<br />-I know it has been called pornographic and unrealistic, but it is FICTION. I think Ms. James wrote the sex rather well and in the beginning of a relationship most people are like rabbits.<br /><br />The bad:<br />-The writing! In the words of Ana,\\"Oh my\\". And Ms. James sometimes a smaller word just fits the bill better. Just because you have a thesaurus, you do not always have to use it.<br />-GOOGLE BDSM and you can figure out where Ms. James got all of her information on the subject. I had a few problems with just this theme of the book. Number one, not everyone that participates in this lifestyle are emotionally void, clinically insane, or otherwise damaged. In fact, most are extremely intelligent and are more \\"successful\\" in terms of emotional well-being, relationships, etc. Number two, you never, never, never would introduce a virgin into the life-style so forcefully. NEVER. Ms. James also seemed to stress the fact that Ana was a normal red-blooded, American girl and so she could not possibly be and in fact was NOT submissive...again we're not crazy.<br /><br />Overall, this book was a good couple hours of simple reading. It would never win a pulitzer (I hope) and it will probably fade to black soon, but it is an original story and fun. I would recommend it to ADULT romance junkies.<br /><br />on a side note: PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not use this as an intro to BDSM guideline. If you want to try this at home look into Jay Wiseman or some other actual practitioner, that actually writes how to's.eman or some other actual practitioner, that actually writes how to's.
0307730697|5.0|This has got to be one of my favorite books this year.  The story is beautifully written and I am awed by Adam Brown and his family.  We have no idea of the sacrifices Americans make every day for our country.  I am shocked and disappointed that anyone would give this book less than five stars.  Heartbreaking that any American could read this book and feel compelled to find fault.  This is a book I will think about for weeks to come and hopefully reread.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|I really enjoyed this I would start to read this book and have to put it down for weeks.  But whenever I got to pick it back up it pulled me right in and I finished it.<br /> It took me from Feb 7th until June 16th it was a wonderful book to have along. I also want to say: people that enjoy this style of writing would enjoy the 19th Wife.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I use it in my office alot it helps me resolve technical issues without replacing anything. Overall  its a great product I reccomend it to anyone!
1401207529|5.0|Loved this book. It was cool to see not only the development of Batman; but the development of Gordon as well. Very fun read!
B0056BMK6K|5.0|This book was so much more than I hoped for or expected.  I have never read a John Locke book before this and dont think his line of books are my style (Maybe the westerns though) but this book is exactly what every author needs to know.  I think he is right on when he tells you he will make you money in sales and save you money and time in wasted traditional marketing ideas.  I think the statistics dont lie, he did have these books sitting idle for 7 months prior to implimenting this marketing stragedy which immediatly turned around aftwerwords.  Great resource well worth the time and money!
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|I had seen this series so often over the past 45+ years that, frankly, I was pretty Star Trek'd (TOS) out. But, being a fan nonetheless, it was time to try it in Bluray. For me, it was like seeing it for the first time. I absolutely commend those who did the transfer, painstakingly upgrading the quality of the entire series. Their work shows. So far, this is the best transfer from a previous format to Bluray that I have seen. The fact they have the new effects and the originals is necessary for us to see the difference and for die hards who (foolishly) want to live in the past. Once starting to view the newly done transfers, there was no need to go back.<br /><br />I found some of the new effects a little over the top, some looking a bit unreal. But there were few times that happened. Almost every extra relating to the series is in the collection, or so it seemed to me. The quality of the episodes is superb. Throughout, I continued to think about the work of those who did the transfer, since it was obvious on all fronts that it was more than a job to them. They clearly felt a duty to get it right. And they did. Their work sets a standard not met by the vast majority of other movies/shows converted from standard to Bluray and I thank them for it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|my grandson love the game when ever he come over it is always grandma can I play please. lol then he has an hour after hour of fun good clean fun
0307730697|5.0|There is not much more to add to all the AMAZING reviews about this Book except I have to say it has changed my life in a special way....Being an Immigrant (I have been a citizen for 20 years) I always knew that the U.S. was a Place that was created by the POWER OF GOD (how else can you explain the founding fathers and the U.S. constitution)...and I count my blessings everyday that I am privileged to be here ....ADAM BROWN is a product of AMERICA...The agonizing pain and rejection he had to overcome to achieve his hopes and dreams were MONUMENTAL ....he was a MANIFESTATION of the POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT that has the ability to MOVE MOUNTAINS and diminish all obstacles when you are a TRUE BELIEVER IN GOD....that we STILL have the capacity to produce individuals of this caliber is ASTONISHING ....READ THIS BOOK AND DREAM.
B002RI9MZC|5.0|Very well written. It covers most of his life, starting from his school years and ending with his death. And he is very honest in the book, which I found fascinating and most unusual and it is that which makes it so special.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Honestly I believed the book was amazing... Christian is so commanding and in control at the beginning of the book, and when he sets his sights on Anastasia it's really breathtaking. You really need to buy all three books. The ending of the first one kinda sucks, so it's good to have another book all about them right there to continue reading.
B000UJ48O0|5.0|This is such a great series.  I couldn't stop watching it, too bad it had 2 end.  Great characters and awesome music with live appearances by the bands. Highly recommend and at a great price 4 the complete series.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is without a doubt one of the best - if not the best - book I've ever read. I laughed, cried, and fell in love along with the characters, and couldn't imagine changing a word. John Green is an absolute genius, and connects to an audience that ranges from teenagers to the elderly. I couldn't put this book down, and still can't. It changed my life, and opened my eyes to just how lucky I truly am. Read this book. I guarantee you will love it.
B008B1VYP0|4.0|It's not often that I like most of the tracks on an album. I can listen to this one straight through. My favorite songs so far are \\"Tickets\\" and \\"Doing Dirt\\". Quite a lot of fun.
B004O91X5Y|4.0|I liked this book so much that I bought multiple copies last summer to give to my mother and sisters as Christmas presents. I think I finally sent the books to them this past March, so much for Christmas shopping early. Reports from my family are that they liked the book too. The story unfolds with a flash-back. The narrator was a servant girl in the house of Lord Ashbury in the early 1900's. As she looks back and tells the tale a murder mystery unravels with well written description of character, setting, history, mystery, and love.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this is so addicting. play it everyday<br />i reccomend you get it!! plzz get it you wont regret it! go get it now.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|Warning...this game is highly addictive!  I play a lot of these puzzles from different aps, but this one is a true challenge.  By far my favorite of all...so much so that I deleted all the others.  The only downfall I foresee is completing all the puzzles...what do I do then?
B00881VLCE|3.0|The puzzles are cute and do offer about 12-15 different pictures.  There are some glitches and doesn't always let you rotate the pieces.
B006VFLIYK|3.0|This book was barely worth reading.  If I could, I'd ask for my money back.  This was definitley not up to Baldacci's usual writing
0765316994|4.0|The book is worth it for the last chapter and the codas alone.<br /><br />Alas, the codas were written so well and its characters were written so realistically that it made the main tale seem more like one of the cardboard cutout plots that it was lampooning.<br /><br />Thanks for another entertaining read, sir.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Very great book. Need to read the other books before. The author did a great job writing this. I would recommend this book to any girl thing about reading the series.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|For anyone that has seen the movie should know it's great. As for receiving the DVD, it seemed to take awhile but came in great conditon, wrapped well and looking brand new so I can't really complain. Thanks!

B0002KZAKS|5.0|I bought this microphone back in January. It's June now, almost July, and it's still fully functional and works like a charm. I purchased this along with a [[ASIN:B001EW5YQS Blue Microphones Icicle XLR to USB Mic Converter/Mic Preamp]]. I do a weekly podcast over Skype, and it sounds fantastic. The noise cancellation is such that I can have my microphone right next to my computer's speakers, and most of the time I do, and there's no echo, no feedback. It's just a cool, crisp sound. I definitely recommend this if you're looking to do broadcasting out of your bedroom as I do. I can't really speak on the microphone's effectiveness for recording vocals though.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|It's fun if you're bored and there is nothing better to do. This is exactly like Mario and Mario is fun.

B0007MWZEK|1.0|Bought this as a Christmas present to replace an older model whose battery was shot. Also bought a replacement battery for the older unit. The new unit doesn't have the same speed/power of the older one with the new battery. And the battery is about dead after 5 minutes of use. And a fully charged battery is so weak after a week of sitting in the closet the unit won't even run. However, the older model with the new battery works better than ever. I wasted money buying a new sweeper. And the new sweeper won't accept the new battery I bought for the older sweeper.
B007U1FEJE|4.0|\\"That's Why God Made the Radio\\" by The Beach Boys is very good, but falls short of being excellent.  If you are a long time Beach Boys fan, buy it immediately and listen to it often.  It will be a great treat for you.  If you are new to The Beach Boys, start with an anthology of familiar hits, such as \\"Sounds of Summer:  Very Best of The Beach Boys,\\" then buy \\"Pet Sounds\\" and listen to it several times.  It will connect with you at a deep emotional level.  You will now be ready to enjoy \\"That's Why God Made the Radio.\\"<br /><br />\\"That's Why God Made the Radio\\" has the wonderful, multi-layered, multi-part melodies and harmonies that are so distinctively  Brian Wilson.  Brian is more than a great songwriter; he is a magnificent composer and arranger as well.  The voices blend in rich ways that allow multiple listenings, with new discoveries.<br /><br />The familiar themes and melodies are here.  Summer, vacation, beaches, good times, listening to the radio in the car and the fun times associated with good music are all here.  These are appropriate and welcome from The Beach Boys.  There are upbeat songs such as \\"Isn't it Time\\" and haunting, reflective ballads such as \\"From There to Back Again.\\"  Brian Wilson can still write, arrange and sing great music.<br /><br />The CD would be excellent if there were two more songs with upbeat tempos.  These are tempos that would make you stand up at your chair and dance if you were at a concert.  These are tempos and songs you would be sure to include on a special play mix you were preparing for a party rock compilation.  These are tempos similar to \\"Fun, Fun, Fun\\" or \\"I Get Around.\\"  Brian still has this in him.  Consider \\"They Can't Take That Away from Me\\" and \\"I Got Rhythm\\" which are both on the 2010 CD \\"Brian Wilson Reimagines Gershwin.\\"  These two songs have tempos reminiscent of \\"Barbara Ann\\" and \\"Help Me, Rhonda.\\"  It would be appropriate for Brian's reflective songs, looking back on his career, to include more up-tempo.Consider The Beatles in \\"The End\\" on \\"Abbey Road,\\" which was their finale and sign-off.  It is an upbeat celebration of rock and roll that features the rock skills of each band member.<br /><br />For an aging Baby Boomer such as me, \\"That's Why God Made the Radio\\" is a special gift.  I have been enjoying new music by Brian Wilson for longer than the major milestones of my life:  longer than I have been a husband, a father, or have pursued my career.  Adding another chapter to this life long continuity and journey is wonderful.  If you are one of my contemporaries and The Beach Boys have been part of your life, buy and enjoy this CD.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Book 2 in this strange love story was very entertaining.  I enjoyed it very much.  I can honestly say that this book is not for everyone.  Those that are not openly able to talk about sex and sexual acts may not want to get started.  However if you have a great imagination you will just LOVE this book.  It's the story of love, lust, dominance, romance, seduction and just raw sex.  The characters become more likable in this 2nd book and I enjoyed the smooth transitioned together from the 1st book.  Good job.  Looking forward to book 3.
0385360169|2.0|Had already read 1st two books of Fifty Shades trilogy; decided to try the audio version ( generally prefer listening to reading). I was VERY disappointed by the reader.  She has a childish voice with little expression, not appropriate for what is supposed to be erotic adult material! I'm taking it right back to the library & will stick to the printed page for this book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved reading this book.  Great story and good notes on lite S&M.  Author did her research. I loved the characters and couldn't put the book down once I started.  I look forward to reading more from this Author.  Good job Sylvia.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|And I'm not just saying that because out of the Phantom makeup Ramin Karimloo is gorgeous. ;-) Sierra Boggess, his Christine, has the most expressive eyes and face I've seen in forever. When she smiles, she smiles with her eyes, and when they sing \\"Point of No Return\\", she looks as if he's already seduced her.<br /><br />A friend first sent me the link on YouTube to the finale. Seeing all six Phantoms on stage together was a thrill. (I don't think Michael Crawford sang, but he did wave very enthusiastically.) So as soon as I learned it was going to be aired on PBS, I made sure to set up the VCR to tape it.<br /><br />It was good, even with all the pledge breaks, and I put it on my Amazon wish list. (The price on Amazon is excellent, although I don't understand why the CD is actually more expensive.) I ordered it, and it arrived last week.<br /><br />Now, you have to understand this about me: I'll order a DVD and it can sit in its wrapper for weeks, months, years before I finally watch it. That wasn't the case with Phantom. I've already watched it three times, and I'll probably watch it again tonight.<br /><br />The only quibble I have is with the sound. At times I could see Ramin's lips moving, but I couldn't hear anything. And when he says to Christine, \\"You... try... my... patience....\\" you have to be listening really hard to hear it. But seriously? That's a very minor quibble.<br /><br />He's made this Phantom very sympathetic. His cry, \\"Why, Christine? Why?\\" broke my heart. I wanted Christine to choose him. Yes, I know he killed, apparently without compunction, but some people are alive only because it's against the law to kill them. *cough*<br /><br />This is the actual play, not a concert, and while the chandelier doesn't actually come down, it does seem to explode.<br /><br />The music, the sets, the costumes, the acting... it all adds up to a magnificent experience.<br /><br />Oh, and right now? The price on Amazon has been reduced. So don't sit there reading this! Go and buy it! I promise you, you won't regret it!

B0086KDOI6|5.0|\\"Infinite Jest\\" is a work of incredibly bleak and profoundly, hopelessly desperate, literary genius. The writing is unquestionably brilliant but riddled with world-class Angst, despair and utter anguish. If you were to concoct a literary cocktail of the brilliance of Pynchon and the grim futility of Coetzee, then you would gain a sense of what to expect in this novel which goes on infinitely in its reading. You will find yourself incredibly challenged by this long and daunting novel with its hundreds of characters and at times maddening rambling about the endless little nuances of tennis, drug addiction and a bizarro central plot involving Quebec separatists and \\"Samizdat,\\" a ghastly entertainment which debilitates people by converting them into lotus-eaters on a massive scale like obsessed viewers of reality TV. The \\"infinite\\" in the title infers that this novel will take you a long time to read: it's a major literary commitment of which I many times questioned the value as its contents are in too many pages hideously and unbearably ugly. It would not be an overstatement to advise that \\"IJ\\" may well be the ugliest masterpiece ever penned by the human hand in all of American literary history. Only a horribly tormented soul like DFW could have written a book this painful as an experience to read: be warned that in many places this novel is unreadably dark and by that I mean this novel rendered unto me a visceral effect akin to nausea, justified only by the Shakespeare quote from which the title is extracted like a rotten molar, but the work is so brilliantly written that one is driven to carry on in the reading anyway. I found only \\"Finnegan's Wake\\" more challenging as a read than \\"IJ.\\" It's clear that Wallace learned a great deal from Pynchon with his selection of a horde of deeply flawed characters whom DFW seemed to select from the cast of a vast freak show. They suffer tragically life-changing catastrophes, physical and psychological, which render them acutely mentally and physically dysfunctional. I don't really see the point of injecting, relentlessly, so many characters into a novel either in the case of DFW or Pynchon and found myself highly irritated by both novelists for populating their books with so many bit-players. DFW's use of apt simile is adept and engaging. The notes were a major, distracting pain in the ass and often deliver only petty, meaningless minutiae. The big problem is that it's nearly impossible to connect all the dots as the writer or even as a committed reader so that legions of characters are tossed into a narrative bouillabaisse for no damn good discernible reason and, thus, are inconsequential on a grad scale and or are so roughly and crudely sketched that one wonders why the cast members were chosen who contribute so little to the grander work. It seems like a waste of time all around but the verisimilitude is not lost on me. The main characters are drawn with endless detail and become round human beings whom we often hope will come out of their heartbreaking debility but are never able to overcome their gaping, massive, catastropic, infinite tragic flaws. It's like reading Homer's vivid and infinite description of the endless deaths of warriors diversely by spear and arrow at Troy in \\"The Iliad.\\" So you'll need a long scorecard if you harbor any hope of keeping up with the coming and going of this epic cast. BirdBrian on Goodreads shared an incredible link to the Sierpinski Gasket on his review of \\"IJ\\", which sheds light on the dizzying fractal of the character threads of the novel without which it might be incomprehensible: [...].... DFW is challenged ultimately to tie together the obscure array of threads of the story line unleashed over the first 150 pages to dizzying and even distressing lengths and the exposition seemed infinite and bewildering. As in life and in this novel grand aspects of the work never become clear, coherent, enlightening, understood or resolved. Either DFW simply became lost and exhausted in the narrative mechanics of his inscrutable, fractally based plot or he wants us to know that life imitates art and we really never figure it all out in time. So where does the \\"jest\\" come in? Perhaps, life is futile and the joke is on you for trying to make sense of it because like this novel you never really will truly fully grasp it all in time. There are scant few, pithy lines of wit in this book, the best of which appear frequently as favorite quotes by devoted readers. At the root of the \\"jest\\" is the Shakespearean quote from \\"Hamlet\\": \\"Alas, poor Yorick!--I knew him, Horatio; a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rises at it.\\" A primary theme of the novel struck me as the need of humanity to carry the maimed, addicted, poverty-stricken and diseased upon its back as in one way or another we are all deeply flawed and afflicted, and that is simply the nature of existence as we know it as inter-connected souls and members of the human race in our lifetimes. In \\"IJ\\" individual tragic flaws are often balanced by individual gifts and the relative balance may determine the outcome and sense of human happiness that as individuals we experience in our lifetimes. The tragedy for me about this novel was DFW's utter myopia to the true, common, quotidian beauty of life: his literary lens is relentlessly focused, indeed tragically obssessed, with the grotesque, bizarro, freakish ugliness of life. As a Bostonian he tore my beloved, beautiful, native city to shreads aesthetically and rendered it in epic catalogue as a literary slag heap. DFW's dark, high-definition lens must have overcome him, given his epic battles with addiction and losing battle with depression, to the extent that he found himself overwhelmed and at the end of a rope by his own hand. His literary legacy is dazzling and he will remain immortal in the American, indeed, global pantheon of literary novelists. Ultimately, I detested the infinite, painful futility of this work of meta-fiction but clearly recognize \\"IJ\\" as the work of a literary genius of the highest order.me lost and exhausted in the narrative mechanics of his inscrutable, fractally based plot or he wants us to know that life imitates art and we really never figure it all out in time.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I just feel like katniss lost the strength and spark of that strong, sophisticated character all readers saw in the first two books... the end was happy, bug katniss felt bland in the last few chapters.  With the action over, her sister gone, and everything settled but a few sad events, she seemed gloomy and empty.  I expected her to be sad with her sister dead.  But then again, in the previous books, all fans watched katniss stay tough through all the hardships shes been through.  I agree with those who say shelost her strentgh.  But peeta is the onewho has not lost hos character through the whole series.<br /><br />Good side is how the action flows through, and how the eve ts wrap up with feelings and aftermath.  The way the story is told with emotions and how it makes you feel the same way the characters feel, it seems realistic and well written.  I wish she could make a book ln katnisss life with peeta and children and the new events.  I will miss this series.<br /><br />Summary:  i expected moreof katniss,  but the book is classic hunger games, even if the two first ones are more lively and better than.  This one.<br /><br />(If the spelling is bad its because its hard to type o. A kindle fire.)
B008AT71WI|5.0|At the time of this post in June 2012, no information from Amazon exists on this product page.  This is the press release stuff I was able to cull from the internet.<br /><br />Tech specs will include a 1080p digitally remastered high definition transfer for the Blu-ray. Audio will be mixed in 5.1 Dolby TrueHD for the BD.<br /><br />This release will not only include the theatrical cut (on BD), but also a completely restored, never-before-seen Director's Cut of the film, featuring a drastically different, and much darker, 20-minute alternate ending.<br /><br />Here's a note about the restoration direct from Warner, \\"The footage of the original ending was previously available only in black & white in the extra content of a limited number of copies of a DVD edition released in 1998. Now, with the help of production notes from Frank Oz and others on the film's creative team, WHV has meticulously restored and digitally remastered the ending, in full color, with the elaborate special effects in tact. Sound has also been rebuilt and mixed in Dolby 5.1. The theatrical version has also been re-mastered.\\"<br /><br />Extras will include the following (no word yet on which of these extras are exclusive to Blu-ray):<br /> *Theatrical version of the film with optional commentary<br /> *The Director's Cut featuring the newly restored 20-minute alternate ending<br /> *Digitally re-mastered picture and 5.1 sound on both versions<br /> *\\"Frank Oz and Little Shop of Horrors: The Director's Cut,\\" an introduction by Frank Oz with Richard Conway<br /> *\\"A Story of Little Shop of Horrors\\" (behind-the-scenes documentary)<br /> *Outtakes and deleted scenes with optional commentary<br /> *Two theatrical trailers<br /><br />The Blu-ray will also include a 40-page Digibook with production notes, stills and rare insights.<br /><br />[UPDATE] When I met Frank Oz at The Saturn Awards, he confirmed the original ending was finally seeing a release in this issue. He personally called the miniaturesmodel maker to tell him that his fine miniature model work was finally going to be seen as the plant rips through cities in a Godzilla style rampage. Paul Dooley will also have his scene restored. He was replaced in reshoots but still got residuals payments on the film despite being cut out.
0545259088|4.0|We loved this series....I think author should write another book...the ending on this one is an opening for another chapter...
B007J4T2G8|4.0|At first it started out so-so,  then I found myself ridiculously unable to stop reading it. I had to know what was going to happen next everytime a chapter ended. I will say the random British euphemisms and the constant repetitive diaalogue was irritating (hence the four stars). I immediately downloaded book two, fifty shades darker and didn't put my kindle down until it was done (review to be followed). Overall I loved the book, the chemistry was palpable between them and their carefree, flirty dialogue (and emails)  put a smile on my face. And I too fell in love with Christian Grey, who could resist? One thing I didnt get was why Ana was irresistible to all men she came across, seriously!!?? Still, I \\"wanted more....so much more.\\"

0761169253|1.0|I thought this was going to be about how artists could make some money on the internet for a change instead of giving everything away for free.<br /><br />Instead it's just a book urging sampling.<br /><br />Just what we need.  More uninformed young people being advised to be lazy, don't actually do anything real, and just sample.<br /><br />Sampling sucks.

B007K3JCAE|5.0|I have to say this movie is better than the first.  it kept me and my friends guessing from beginning to the end.  I saw a lot of people complain about the UV Copy.  Let me share on how the UV copy works to the best of my knowledge.  You can down load a copy of the movie to your computer or mobile device.  You do not use the UV website like it says go to Flixster you can use your Facebook log-in as your account.  But with Flixter.com and the Flixster App. for mobile and computer you can download a digital copy of the movie.  Its confusing i know, but that is how it works.  Use your UV code at Flixster.com not the UV website.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|I love the Bee Gees. The DVD was great. Never had the chance to see them in person.<br />I wish I could have made one concert.
B00881VLCE|4.0|the app works well on my kindle .. images are clean and nice. if u like puzzles u will enjoy this.
0345803485|1.0|This books is so poorly written, I could not even finish it.  I will never get those hours of my life back.  My daughters are the age of the two lead characters and are well educated, they definitely don't talk like they are in mid-century England...the author, and I use that term loosely, obviously did not study the dialect of these United States.  And if a person \\"bit her lip\\" as much as Ana did, she would look like a zombie chewed her face off.  I counted five times in the first two chapters, and totally lost track when the hash marks on my notepad reached 30.<br /><br />The popularity of this book amazes me, if all the people who liked it would go out and read some real erotica, they would definitely change their ratings.  The storyline could have been good had the author researched more.  I cannot believe this made it through the editing process.  This is the classic case of \\"knowing someone\\" in the publishing world...perhaps because her husband has some celebrity status.<br /><br />The author began her \\"career\\" by writing \\"fanfiction\\", for those of you who don't know what that is.  Ms. James took the characters that someone else created and made up stories about them to post to Internet sites.  She was noticed and changed the names and story line a bit and so Fifty Shades was born.<br /><br />She's laughing all the way to the bank and it's a shame that authors with real talent are being let go by the big publishing houses because of the economy.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|I had been aching to see this movie again, and found it on amazon for so cheap! Fast shipping and glad I purchased it on here :)
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|this is not a stephanie myer's romance. this is an adult romance that doesn't have graphic sex. I normally do not read anything like this, I like racey romances, fast paced reads that keep you on your toes the whole time. This is not that book, yes lots of twist and turns, and while the main heronie is not as strong as i'd like she has a clear charcter that realistically i could see. I greatly enjoyed the mix of history and an old school romance. This book had me hooked and for a mid 20s person that's telling. I have a strong love for history but this book just really gave an old school romance feel to a fun read.
B00845PV16|1.0|I liked the first Ghost Rider, I'm a fan of Cage and I'm so disappointed in this one. If I could, I would ask for my money back! I've seen better B rated movies than this one and this one had the feel of such a movie, low budged and acting not required.<br />Anyone thinking of renting or buying this movie should not waste their money on this one.
0307454568|5.0|Unlike most trilogies, I'm sad to finish Larsson's novels.  An exciting ride from start to finish.  And now I'll go check out the movies to see if they did the books' justice.
B005LAIHYU|4.0|\\"History prefers legends to men. However history remembers me before I was a President, it shall only remember a fraction of the truth.\\" After stopping the whipping of a slave Abraham Lincoln's (Walker) father is fired from his job. Unable to pay off his debts his boss comes in the night and kills his wife. Young Lincoln sees this and begins his quest for vengeance. Ten years later he sees the man who murdered his mother and sees his chance, but it doesn't turn out like he planned. A man named Henry Sturgess (Cooper) begins to train Lincoln so he can complete his revenge. I have to say that I am a huge sucker for cheesy Sci-Fi movies. I love movies like \\"Piranha\\" and \\"Mega-shark vs. Giant Octopus\\". Something about those movies are just fun to me. I bring that up because that's what I was expecting from this movie. I couldn't have been more wrong. While it was a little over the top in some parts, this movie was more of a straight horror movie instead of going for the cheesiness I was thinking. That made the movie even better then I expected. I have never really been a big vampire movie guy but this one was great and may be my favorite vampire movie of all time. This ain't your girlfriend's vampires. This is more like \\"Underworld\\" on speed and more gore. Very very fun movie and you will never think of the Civil War the same way again. I highly recommend this, if you go in with an open mind and looking for blood you will love this like I did. Overall, a very fun movie that you can watch over and over. I really had fun with this one. I give it an A.
B0067EKY7M|4.0|\\"You can't catch faith with a fishing rod.\\" After Harriet (Blunt) contacts Dr. Alfred Jones (McGregor) about a Shiek from Yemen who wants to bring the sport of salmon fishing to his country he laughs it off. After being given no choice in the matter Jones begins to do just enough to keep his job. After meeting the Shiek and helping Harriet through a crisis his outlook begins to change. He puts everything he has into making the dream possible. The sign of a good movie is one that keeps you interested and makes you like it when you aren't even in the mood to watch it. I wanted to watch this based off the preview, but at the time I sat down to see it I really wasn't in the mood for a movie like this. It did start off a little slow but quickly sucked me in and by the end I was so into it that I couldn't remember why I didn't want to watch it. I have fished many times but I'm not what you would call an avid fisherman. The reason I say that is because this movie has the perfect balance of enough fishing to keep fisherman entertained, but not enough to make it all about fishing, much like the way \\"A River Runs Through It\\" did. The last twenty minutes of the movie makes you feel a proverbial \\"rollar-coaster\\" of emotions. Every few minutes something happens that changes how you feel while not turning into the cheesy and sappy ending that it could have been. Overall, a good movie that people who fish and those who don't will both enjoy. I liked it. I give it a B+.
0316056871|5.0|This was a recent gift for my wife.  She said it was really great and she enjoyed reading it.  It made her laugh out loud!
B004VF68AQ|5.0|After 'Strays' came out, I read many reviews lambasting the departure from typical Jane's Addiction song formatting.  It was too clean, no rough edges, etc. ad nauseum.  Now as I read some of the reviews here on Amazon, I'm seeing some of the same crap.  Listen, the band is older now, and their music has also evolved along with the members of the band.  Boring???  Then you aren't listening to it with an open mind to change. Perk is absolutely amazing on this album, and while Dave's part is far more understated than it was on \\"Strays\\", his contribution is unmistakable and vital.  Perry's voice is so much better today than it was even 10 years ago.  He is healthier, and it shows - and we should all be happy for him.  Revel in this deeply reflective, dark, and revealing album, embrace the evolution of this band, one of our few remaining rock and roll treasures. Put your headphones on, close your eyes, and LISTEN with no preconceived notions.

B005GHN2GG|5.0|Just loved the adventure and suspense of this magical book.  Want more please!  The tension between Silhara and Martise hums as the story unfolds.  Thank goodness they don't  just jump into bed after the first few pages, this is actually a great story that gradually unfolds as the book progresses.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|This guy has a classic country western voice.  Just a few years from now if not sooner, he will take the country western scene by storm.  I love his singing and I'm not a devout country western fan.<br />His first album reflects his good taste in the music he chooses to sing.  Support Scotty. He deserves your interest.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|This is possibly the biggest load of cr@p I've read in ages and paid so much for.  Please tell me how this became a best seller, as I cannot fathom why.  Any possibility of a refund?  Next time round (heaven help me!) I will have to be paid to read any of this author's books.
B001EN71CW|4.0|Firefly was an interesting TV series that mixed sci-fi high tech with realistic pioneer surroundings. In real life, we have a mixture of high tech and low tech all around us. You see this mix even more when visiting small back woods towns and especially third world countries. Firefly took this reality as a premise by showing the pioneer colony worlds on the fringe of civilization with only the most basic technology backdropped by the frontier world like it was in the old west. In contrast, the inner planets where the capital cities were was very modern and hi-tech.<br /><br />The television show only lasted one short season due to the short sight of the network execs. The show was followed by \\"Serenity\\", a feature film that brought some closure to the story.  There remains a devoted fan base that continues to hope for additional films or a new TV show.<br /><br />The Blu-ray transfer is well done though it seems a bit grainy. This may be due to the film stock used in the series and is preferable to the overdone digital noise reduction (DNR) I've seen in other films that smoothes out all the details and makes the actors look waxy. I'm glad that the Blu-ray transfer engineers chose to keep the original grain and detail.<br /><br />I highly recommend this Firefly boxset and follow up movie Serenity.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I started this game and instently I loved it and I'm always playing it now this is the best Game ever!!!!!!!

B003EY7IRC|1.0|There was absolutely nothing in this series that couldn't have happened in one book. Seriously. The whiny, vacillating, navel gazing protag is hard to like or even root for, if even one tenth of the world's female population is this self absorbed, whiny, shallow and unable to make a decision, then the human race is doomed and we should all abandon aspirations to procreation this instant. Please. I don't even care that we never find out what Barrons is and how he got that way, and by the time they got together in the end I was so beyond suspension of disbelief that I was almost hoping he'd hulk out and eat her for being terminally stupid. I mean seriously, actions speak louder than words, how many times does someone have to save your frikkin butt before you get it? Ugh! I'd gotten this and the Highlander series based on recommendations, but I don't think I'll read them out of fear that the heroines will be similarly afflicted with stupidity. While I understand trying to imbue your heroines with a sense of vulnerability to create a connection with the reader, bludgeoning them over the head with characters whose entire foundation rests on either complete idiocy, lack of foresight and vision that only occurs in hindsight is certainly not the way to do it. If you want a heroine that's accessible, smart vulnerable and just all around awesome, check out Diana Rowland's Kara Gillian series, there's a chick to love.
B00785P2QC|5.0|it is great I love playing it every day gets irritating soon thought but its a good game love it
B007L6VR12|4.0|Wes Andersen remains in a place apart as far as contemporary directors are concerned. Last we heard from him, he brought us \\"Fantastic Mr. Fox\\", a delightful stop-motion movie of all things. Now three years later, Anderson returns with this.<br /><br />\\"Moonrise Kingdom\\" (94 min.) brings the story of 12 year olds Suzy and Sam, who have run away (she: from home; he: from scouts camp) on an idyllic island in the northeast in the summer of 1965. That is the starting premise of the movie, and to tell more would ruin your viewing pleasure. Several comments and observations: this movie captures a lot of things, but clearly tugs at the hearts of those who grew up in that era, now almost 50 years ago. It was a completely different world, where communication was not instant and not omni-present. In that sense, the movie is very nostalgic indeed. Second, the visuals of the movie are outstanding. Lots of brown and orange are filtered into the scenery, making it look even more idyllic that it already is. Third, the acting here is mostly superb, with lots of juicy performances from Bruce Willis (his best in years), Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, and even Tilda Swinton and Harvey Keitel in short cameos (Swinton as the Social Worker, and Keitel as Commander Pierce).<br /><br />But the jewel piece in the movie goes to the 12 year old actors, Jared Gilman as Sam and even more so Kara Hayward as Suzie. She is simply amazing. I enjoyed this movie immensely. It is funny, poignant, and whimsical at its very best. I read that this movie was made on a $16 million dollar budget, which is less than 1/10th of many of the current blockbuster movies. It's amazing how much more can be achieved with so much less. If you are in the mood for an outstanding indie movie, \\"Moonrise Kingdom\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
0345803485|2.0|I had to get this book to see what all the hoopla was about.  When I first started to read it, it was fine, but as I continued I became confused.  Confused about why this is an erotic book, not necessarily why it's a bestseller.  I was practically screaming at this girl the whole time I read the book.  I wanted to stop reading it but thought it would get better.  Well it did at the very end.  I honestly felt it was a cultural thing because I didn't find find anything erotic about the book.  After I read some of the reviews I realized it wasn't just me.
0143034901|3.0|For the most part, book blurbs are bunk, but Stephen King is the exception. Here's what he had to say about The Shadow of the Wind: \\"Shadow is the real deal, a novel full of cheesy splendor and creaking trapdoors, a novel where even the subplots have subplots.\\" That was enough to persuade me to open this book, and I was not disappointed. It's set in post-war Barcelona, and the story begins with a setup that any true bookworm would find compelling. Young Daniel Sempere is taken by his widowed bookseller father to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, an enormous building full of packed bookshelves that house single copies of books that might otherwise be lost. The boy is charged with selecting one book that he will responsible for protecting, and he chooses The Shadow of the Wind by Julian Carax. The book captivates the boy, who searches out every title he can find by Carax, a task that proves difficult because someone is systematically searching out and destroying all of Carax's book. As Daniel grows up, he learns more about the mysterious author and in his search meets a variety of interesting people with connections to Carax. The story flashes back from the 1950s Spain of Franco to the horrors of the Spanish Civil War, threading the political, economic and literary history of Spain through the story of Daniel's quest for answers to the secrets of Carax's life and his own. Zafon's novel includes several truly memorable characters and vividly evokes Barcelona.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|Having watched Iron Man, Hulk and Thor movies, I have to say Captain America was by far the best Avenger movie to-date.  Chris Evans brings a lot of pathos to the character before he becomes a super human being.  As always Stanley Tucci (even though was part of the movie for such a short time) does an outstanding job.  I've watched the movie only twice, but I know I'll go back and watch it again a few times.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Sometimes, I'm a little hesitant to buy self-published books on Amazon. But, boy, is this one a winner!<br />Imaginitive and well-written-  I look forward to reading more work by this author.

0062082353|5.0|I first must say that I don't get to happy about the U.S. government.  They are way to greedy and lack any type of common sense or logic.  On the other hand I am really impressed and respect all the hard work and dedication that comes from our men and women who serve in our Armed Forces.  \\"THANK YOU! Mr. Kyle\\" from the bottom of my heart!<br />I loved the story and the way it was written.  This is a fine dose of simple,hard, smack you in the face facts that will really get your attention.  To me it is always amazing where a person comes from, what drives them, what shapes them and where they end up.  I found it wonderful, funny, sad, harsh, frightening, serious and cool as a block of ice!!!!  Some other simple thoughts that I have on this book.:<br />Brings a whole new meaning to the wedding vows \\"For better and for worse.\\"  That is what I call \\"True Love!\\".<br />A 300 Win. Mag.. Huh?  I never would of guessed that one.  That is some knock down power!<br />THANK YOU Mr. Kyle for making the world a much \\"SAFER\\" place.  All it would take is one of those drugged up nutcases to get past our wide open borders and you have many dead U.S. citizens.  My Mom and Dad taught me to take out the trash.  I figure your Mom and Dad must of taught you the same thing.  OUTSTANDING!!!!!!<br />I want Chris Kyle for my President!  He would simply remove problems one by one!<br />I find it a shame that the Military is a lot like Corporate America.  The people on the bottom that really work are the one's who really know what is going on and what needs to be done to make it right!!!!!<br />Mr. Kyle reminds me of all the great ones, Michael Jordan, Dale Earnhardt, etc., just to name a few.  They are off the charts awesome but still continue to strive for more greatness!!!!<br />All in all I think Mr. Kyle did a wonderful job with this book.  I am glad that He published it.  One hell of a story and I have always loved fact over fiction!
0345803507|3.0|SPOILERS IN REVIEW:<br /><br />So I must say I thoroughly enjoyed book 1 & 2, but the minute I started book 3 I was utterly lost. Most of the first parts go from scene to scene with Ana thinking about how her wedding went (rather than the reader experiencing it with her, which I think we all deserved that at least).<br /><br />& why did the pregnancy happen? Ana and Christian still had so much to learn and explore with each other. They both needed time to heal before getting pregnant. A child doesn't always bring happy endings and I feel it should've ended with them on the boat embracing each other and being happy and talking about the future. But no...she got pregnant and he yelled at her & then she got pregnant again once they moved into the big house.<br /><br />The thing with Jack should've been thoroughly explained especially when she went to give him the money...why did Christian follow her? How did he know that Ana was in trouble? Why did he ask her if it was always about the money if he claimed he loved her so? And why did it take all that almost near death experience for him to notice the love she had for him? It was very frustrating!<br /><br />I wish there was of explanations to things & it dissapointed me a bit.

This is a fascinating read about how the mind works to create habits.  This book exceeded my expectations. I now understand why I've not been able to change some habits. The understanding of the whole \\"loop\\"...cue, routine and reward will help me get to where I need to be. Tony Robbins talks about this too by challenging me to ask myself \\"why\\" I want to achieve a certain goal, or change a habit because that will connect me to the reward, the feeling I get by changing a habit or reaching a goal. The whole loop that Duhigg talks about and how it's used in promotion and advertising was eye opening, especially the Target example. I love shopping at Target and, yes, I've been using Febreeze for years for precisely the reasons outlined in the book. The Power of Habit has changed the way I think about myself and I will finally be able to kick some old habits and replace them with new ones by using that \\"loop\\" talked about in the book. I'm very excited that I can apply the principles to my work also. Thanks Mr. Duhigg for putting forth such a life changing book.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is so additive.  I love it so much that I have to play for a couple of hours everyday.
B00785P2QC|5.0|so far havering a lot of fun playing it. I love city building games so this is right up my alley. haven't needed to spend any real money so far.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I really like this because it is lightweight. It does not really add any extra weight to the kindle fire. I carry it in my purse so I like that it isnt really heavy like the leather covers. The only negative I can find: I cant fold it on the side like the diagram shows to make it sit up.
B006ZAZ31U|4.0|This is a great look at what one man went through in order to achieve his dream.  What makes it even more amazing is the fact he didn't conceive of this dream until he was in his 20's with some hard drug years behind him.  This book talks about the sacrifices, trials and triumphs that he accomplished to become a Navy SEAL.  I liked the pictures.  It was nice to be able to put a face to the words and descriptions.  Makes me appreciate our soldiers even more!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book is boring, repetitive, and goes nowhere fast.  I'm not really sure what all of the hype is about.  If this is considered a shocking or titillating best seller, people really need to read more or - god-forbid - actually LIVE instead of indulging in half baked teenage fantasies.  However...  I admit, we all need a good fantasy now and then.  If that is what you are looking for, I would recommend skipping this book and going for Anne Rice's Exit to Eden or the Beauty series.  They are very well written and much more of an interesting read.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|I bought the book for its title and for the book description. It was quirky;funny and had heart. It tells of the rocky relationships that surround a lot of mothers and daughters. Family secrets . The undying love of sisters and the joy of a first love. This is a book of discovery and of mystery.  Does her sexy neighbor really like her or is Rose headed for heart break. Why she is in danger?  This book hits every emotion. You will find yourself cheering for Rose as she dares to live her life and not sit on the sidelines any more

0811826848|1.0|Like many people I'm partially colour blind. I purchased this book years ago but ended up giving it away because I was not able to read it. Too many of the pages are in colour and I had a major problem distinguishing the type from the colour background on those pages.  I was hoping that the powers that be might release a Kindle version of The Beatles Anthology but, alas, it has not happened yet. Please release a Kindle version so I can read this book!
B00456PKG4|3.0|Never have I experienced the dichotomy of disinterest and appreciation as I did watching Prince of Persia.<br /><br />A Persian King adopts a white kid to be a Prince, but little does the King know the boy will grow to be a sand-surfing, parkour extremist intent on seamlessly blending what feels like a sword and sandal version of producer Jerry Bruckheimer's Pirates of the Caribbean films mixed with a recycled Mummy sequel.  It's FX heavy with a ton of action, a heavy dose of predictability, a few slick escapes, and a whole lot of storyline involving a magical dagger.<br /><br />Gemma Arterton overspeaks all her lines, like she's lip-synching a music video.  Easy on the eyes though.  Aside from his epic tan, Ben Kingsley phones in a foreshadowed villainous performance.  Believe it or not, Jake Gyllenhaal ends up being the most competent and energetic actor in the entire film.  As far as chemistry between Arterton and Jake Gyllenhaal, let's just say her performance was so wooden Jake earned the nickname Geppetto Gyllenhaal from me.<br /><br />Watch this film one time for the cinematography, the scenery, and the fun.  Watch it twice if you're a Gyllenhaal fan.

1451608659|5.0|My review is biased because I knew Dominique's sister, Jennifer and because I was a big fan of Dominique's.  Jennifer attended school in my home town.  Dominique's revealing criticism of the Karolis was eye opening.  I don't think Dominique had a chip on her sholder revealing this because she also revealed some less than flattering things about herself after her emancipation from her parents.  The three sisters in the story are the real heroes.  They overcome abusive home lives and disability and in the end find each other to start a new chapter in their lives.  The book is revealing re: how political the gymnastic team selection goes.  You suspect this in other countries but not the USA.  We may never have a womens gymnastic team like the \\"Magnificent Seven\\" again, and it was great to relive that time through the author's point of view.  This is the best \\"sports\\" book I've read for quite some time.
B0033PQUXA|5.0|Do you love the movies? Cinema Paradiso. This film came out in 1988 and was directed by Giuseppe Tornatore. It justifiably won the academy award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1989.  If you have ever watched it, you can understand the power of this film. If you have yet to view this film, now is a great time to do so. I can pretty much guarantee this film will strike a chord with you if you give it an honest shot. Chances are somebody, at some point in your life, recommended it to you. If there was an award for best foreign film ever, Cinema Paradiso would be in the running. It is, in the utmost, a movie about the power of life. It is also a movie about the power of film.  A rambunctious little boy named Toto loves hanging out at the local movie theater in a small Italian village.  Toto befriends Alfredo the wise projectionist. Alfredo takes Toto under his wing and a life long friendship is formed. Toto spends all his time at the theater and learns the trade. Time goes on and Toto grows into a young man. He lives life and experiences love and heart break. The time comes and he leaves the small Italian village to make his own way in the world. Cinema Paradiso is essentially the story of what happens when Toto returns to the village over 30 years later. Life is a series of experiences, lessons, passions, and relationships. This film presents all of this in a beautiful and memorable way.  Cinema Paradiso is a film lovers film that you will never forget. Watch and enjoy.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|I was quite suprised seeing and enjoying this movie after having read some of the professional reviews which had called it rather trite.  The movie is more than touching and is incredibly moving.  Of course it is well-acted given the cast but the story brings out the best in all of them.  Maggie Smith is incredible and out of character from most of the \\"snooty\\" roles she has well-played in the past.  Judi Dench is, of course, glorious.  The remainder of the cast is wonderful and they all work together for this ensemble piece.  Lots of laughs and some tear-jerking but not too hard of a jerk.  Compassionate story telling at its best.  I recommend it to anyone over 40 and anyone under, for that matter, that might want to have a look at what aging gracefully looks like.  Beautiful  movie.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Great book but not for everyone.  I loved it.  The characters are rich and the writing is excellent.  I definately recommend this book:)

B000MR9D5E|1.0|At first I saw the trailer, and was like, wow this series is amazing, it even covers the northern lights. I paid $55.96 for it, when it arrived i put it on the dvd player. When I saw the first episode I was like, this is a complete ripoff!! It doesn't explain different phenomenon around the earth or covers different things that happen. They just talk 10 minutes of nature and 40 minutes about animals.  The just go on and on about rare species like snow leopard, they show like 30 seconds of the rare species Lynx, that one can live in the forest and never see one. When The episode of the mountains came, I was so excited, because I love the stars and all of that stuff. It talked about penguins, and they showed like 5 seconds of the Southern Lights, and then they kept on talking about penguins. They also showed the midnight sun, but didn't explain  why it happened. Another thing that I really dislike, is the voice of David Attenborough. His voice is really annoying after seeing a couple of episodes.<br /><br />It should be called Nature Animals, as you've never seen them before!  I would like the company to refund me all the money that I spent on this series, thank you!

B000VOC90Y|3.0|I've owned this backpack about 11 weeks I got it as a birthday gift and the bag is amazing. It held my laptop and all of my gaming and some of my music gear easily. Lotsa awesome storage pouches convenient compartments for all my stuff.<br /><br />However I had one serious problem.<br /><br />The other day while I was zipping it up to take my laptop to work with me the zipper snagged and then 2-3 of teeth separated and now I can no longer zip it on the laptop compartment. The warranty process is not absurd or bad by any means, but I can't go without a bag for the time it will take to send it in have them determine it was in fact a defect and then send it back. I need to go buy a replacement bag and can't really rationalize buying a second one from them since I have had this issue. Still going to send it in just unfortunate that a flaw like this is causing me to buy another bag.

B008CPZNL6|5.0|The application is in my opinion absolutely awesome. Besides being very customizable, has great graphics and it's super easy to use.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|I have had the chance to hear quite a few cuts from this before buying this album, mostly via radio. (Don't I LOVE the fact that you can listen to radio stations all over the world?) After waiting 5 years, a new album from the holy triumvirate, all loose ends from singles releases tied up. We had in 2010 the release of Caravan and BU2B, both of which are on this album, but have been remixed a little but don't stray from the basic idea. Just to wet the appetites of the fans, Headlong Flight was released ahead of the album as a single, which had the touches of some of Bastille Day and Anthem, sort of tying in the 70's Rush that some have been dying to hear. The Garden actually was released in some markets just on radio, and it shows a softer side to this band, written beautifully musically with the addition of stringed instruments.<br /><br />If you were looking for the 2112 form of Rush, it isn't here musically, but it is in a sense conceptually. All of the songs tie together in some form of telling a story, which is the EXACT reason these guys are tops on my list as far as talent goes. You might, if you are a fan, sit there listening, saying, no, these guys haven't blown me away. Listen to this in headphones, with a Rock Equalizer setting, and stereo headphones. That will blow you away. I can say that my favourite cut from this is one that I had to wait to hear until after the album was released, which was The Anarchist. (It kind of fits me, since I don't always follow rules!) But get this album, if for nothing else, to add to your collection. It isn't Presto, which I think was probably one of the worst albums put out there by them, but it definitely isn't 2112 or Hemispheres, the latter of which is my favourite, but it does equal their time before going into concept albums with complexed music and themes to tunes. (Example: Fly By Night, though that does have one concept tune of By-Tor And The Snow Dog.)
B005LAII1C|5.0|Great comedy. I had the pleasure of seeing it in advance about a month ago. The theater was jam packed, and everyone came out happy.<br /><br />Anything with Seth MacFarlane's name is worth at least a peek if you are a fan. Obviously the movie is geared for \\"Family Guy\\" fans, but really even if you don't like that show it's still worth a look.<br /><br />The plot is pretty good: Boy never had any real friends then dreams his teddy bear would come alive, and it does!!! It's like an afterschool special from the 80s, but without all the political correctness you'd come to expect from those shows.<br /><br />This is like if you took one of your favorite teddy bears as a kid but saw him grow up to be as a party animal.<br /><br />Every joke hits the mark here including jabs at Seth's own creation \\"Family Guy\\". I have a lot of favorite scenes in the movie including the \\"Teddy Ruxpin\\" fight scene.<br /><br />There's a couple of nice dramatic moments too , but it's mostly a raunchy comedy with over the top gags and punchlines.<br /><br />I enjoyed it a lot, and the appearance of Sam Jones having fun with his Flash Gordon persona was definitely a sight to see.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg does a pretty good job as grownup John Bennett who has to make a decision about whether to cut out his best friend. Mila Kunis was also great. Obviously this was her part as well.<br /><br />MacFarlane as \\"Ted\\" was wonderful, and Patrick Stewart provided the perfect narration for this. All in all just an all around gag fest.
B000QJLQY4|5.0|Recently, I have been assisting a start-up in preparation for raising Venture Capital.  At the recommendation of a friend, I bought The ART of the START The Time-Tested, Battle-Hardened Guide for Anyone Starting Anything by Guy Kawasaki.  Mr. Kawasaki is a venture-capitalist.  Prior to becoming a VC, Mr. Kawasaki worked at Apple.<br />Mr. Kawasaki set as his goal for the book to help entrepreneurs and others starting enterprises reduce the preparatory time and move straight into development.  (Prep time including visiting with various experts to collect ideas, learn potential problems that can be avoided, etc.)<br />Mr. Kawasaki writes with style, verve and an appealing since of humor.<br />He starts with a summary of five things that each new effort should include.  One of the intriguing concepts is to avoid developing a mission statement, but instead develop a very short mantra.  Having been in some very unproductive, long, painful, meetings where mission statements were being hatched, I can appreciate the recommendation.  As an example, he uses the famous \\"Think\\" from IBM as an example (I have one of the paperweights from years gone by that IBM used to give to customers that has the Think motto engraved).<br />Another recommendation from Mr. Kawasaki is to move straight to product development and selling.  Product testing in his view is the realm of big established businesses - not start-ups.  Build and modify in response to customer reactions.  If customers use the product differently from your, plan, celebrate it and see if you can spread that utilization to create more customers.<br />Chapters roughly follow the development cycle of start-up formation, product development and refinement, capital raising, partnering, brand development and growth phase.  The book concludes with a chapter on \\"The Art of Being a Mensch\\", a treatise on being nice to everyone you meet, regardless of their circumstance.<br />Each Chapter has an FAQ section, with very useful questions and answers, presumably culled from questions the author received during speaking engagements.  I found those contained immense practical advice and good common sense.  I give Mr. Kawasaki extra credit for his quotes.  While opening chapters and adding the occasional quote is a technique widely used, he found a variety of really cool, totally appropriate, quotes.<br />This book isn't new - it's been around for a while.  But if you are involved in a start-up, or doing a new venture inside an existing company, I think you will find something of both interest and value.<br />Highly recommended.and answers, presumably culled from questions the author received during speaking engagements.

0071752854|5.0|It's not very often that you find a book on persuasion, sales or even pitching that is worth reading. Many of the books out on any of those categories that come out seem to be watered down versions of yesteryear or a pitch fest for products and or coaching programs. This book is true to what is says and can help you learn how to \\"pitch anything\\" with sound advice that works.<br /><br />If your job has anything to do with persuading others you are missing out if you do not have this book along with copious notes and action plans to implement what you have learned. It would take you about 50 - 60 of the absolute books on sales, psychology, social dynamics, negotiation, body language, heuristics and persuasion to get what is in the pages of this book and then you would have to decipher how to put the puzzle together and then make a formula that you could use.<br /><br />If all you took away was the chapter on \\"frame control\\" this book would be more than worth it.  One of the absolute best things about this book is that it is easy to follow and for each category of information there is a way for you to develop your own \\"secret sauce\\" so that you can pitch anything.<br /><br />You may not be ready for this type of book and what it can teach you or the strategies that come from it if you are shy about getting to the point or wasting a ton of time trying to build rapport, but if you feel you are ready to learn and implement you will have a foundation to build from.<br /><br />Add this book to your library.

B0000027D5|1.0|The Product Description states:  \\"Japanese Limited Edition Issue of the Dsd Mastered Album Classic in a Deluxe, Miniaturized LP Sleeve Replica of the Original Limited Vinyl Album Artwork\\"  This is untrue.  Once I received the CD it is the same one I have--not the collector's edition.  At the end of the Product Description in unnoticable print it states \\"This text refers to an alternate Audio CD edition.\\"  What does that mean? This is deceptive and disappointing.  I beleive this may be a violation of the Consumer Sales Practices Act in Ohio.  BEWARE!
B007V508CC|2.0|I can honestly say I feel cheated out of the money I spent on this album.  I've listened (sometimes forcibly) to \\"Overexposed\\" several times and it's really generic & soulless.  The only two songs that seem like the \\"old\\" Maroon 5 are Beautiful Goodbye & Sad.  Everything else seems formulaic & cookie-cutter:  hey, guys, let's pop some lyrics & notes into the Song-O-Matic and make some music for the masses.  Yikes!  I guess if you want to dance, you've got your beats.  But if you were looking for music that would stick with you and make you forget all your other playlists you are in for a world of disappointment.

No one really mentioned story or characterization in six pages of interviews. So I went in expecting a thin story and a fun ride. little did I know it was a ride to Hades by way of the river Crap. They somehow managed to make a thinner story than they did in the Clash of the Titans remake. It feels less story and more like a rough draft of the first story outline.

B0011UJMK2|5.0|Without a doubt, an extremely interesting and captivating book: one which I started and finished in just a couple of days. There are many levels to this book<br />  1) a serial killer of children is running amok the orderly Soviet society<br />  2) Stalin's vision of Russia and the aftermath of WWII is devastating the \\"perfect\\"  Soviet world<br />  3) Leo, a Soviet officer, is tasked with protecting the virtues of the Soviet society by arresting any one who is a threat, anyone who is perceived to be a threat and/or anyone who might be a threat. He is to make sure that they confess to their crimes and that they  and their families will no longer be a threat.<br />  4) Raisa, Leo's wife, lives in fear of Leo and finds everything about Leo and the new Stalinist Russia to be disgusting and revolting.<br /><br />It is when Leo is ordered to cover up the murder of a friend's child that his world begins to crumble. It isn't long before Leo begins to doubt his belief system and begins to find there maybe things wrong with the policies of Stalin and the government system of justice. Along with this realization, Leo and his wife become fugitives from the Soviet legal system. As fugitives their lives are destroyed and they will be executed. As such, their only goal is to prove that there is a serial killer who is preying on children; a serial killer who the government will not admit exists.<br /><br />Child 44 provides an insight into the grim realities that faced the majority of the Soviet population in the 1950's. A world where you were expected to report suspicious behavior, a world where you could trust no one and a world that assumed you  were guilty of something. The character of Leo was interesting to follow as he went from supporter of the Soviet state to political fugitive. Child 44 is as much about condemnation of the Soviet state as it is about the ability of humans to function, to change and to grow while living in terrible conditions.

B0070NSPCU|3.0|I try to be completely honest in my reviews, so hopefully this will give readers an idea of the book.<br /><br />[Quick Recommendation:]<br />If you want a original, intriguing story, i advise you to at least try this book. Its a good story with a few flaws, which if you can ignore, makes it a worthy read.<br />If you want to quit after the first chapter, i advise you to keep reading, it does get better.<br />I plan on buying the next book in the series.<br /><br />[General Comments]<br />When i go to buy a book, i usually read some of the 2-4 star reviews to get a better idea of the true nature of the book. At least in my experience it seems that the 1 star reviews are usually just hate reviews, usually people who didn't finish the book. Same with the 5 star reviews, there always seem to be alot of reviews that heap tons of praise but never address the negatives of the novel.<br /><br />I wasn't sure what to expect when i started this book. There was 80 5 star reviews at the time and 1 4 star review, which wasn't very reassuring- lets be honest, there is no book that every single reader is going to give five stars. However it had been a while since i had last read a fantasy book, and i was intrigued about how the author would carry a single character POV and whether he could do it successfully. So i bought it, and started reading it a few days later.<br /><br />I almost didn't get through the first chapter.<br /><br />[Negatives Below]<br />-(Punctuation/Grammar/Spelling) One of the other reviewers brought up some of the spelling/wording issues. In my opinion these are not book killers, i can look over such things if the book is enjoyable and has my attention. In this book, while there were some, i don't think they should stop you from reading it.<br /><br />However the thing that makes a book hard to read some times is sentence structure and punctuation. The author seemed fairly loose about these aspects, especially early in the novel. As the novel progressed thestructure got better however. For some incite into what im talking about, lets take a look at the first paragraph of the first page of the book. I have copied this paragraph exactly how it is in the book, word-for-word, and placing punctuation where it is shown.<br /><br />\\"He had many names. Although yet to reach his thirtieth year history had seen fit to garner him with titles aplenty: Sword of the Realm to the mad king who sent him to plague us, the Young Hawk to the men who followed him through the trials of war, Darkblade to his Cumbraelin enemies and, as I was to learn much later, Beral Shak Ur to the enigmatic tribes of the Great Northern Forest - the Shadow of the Raven.\\"<br /><br />If you made complete sense of that on your first read through- then kudos to you. The lack of punctuation, mixed with all of the unknown information (remember its the first paragraph of the book), made me have read it 2 or 3 times before i was able to understand it. As it reads here, it looks like a list of titles. The first time i read it, without the punctuation, it looked like the author was saying that one of the titles was: \\"Sword of the Realm to the mad king...\\" not that the mad king considered him the \\"Sword of the Realm\\". It is also not clear what the \\"Shadow of the Raven\\" refers to. Is this the translation of \\"Berak Shak Ur\\"? Or another title?<br /><br />Does this take away from the book? Yes. Especially early on. The first couple chapters drag bad. I think it is because of the reading difficulty. However like i said it gets better, most of the book was better.<br /><br />-[Content: Minor Spoilers follow:] For most part the book was logical (or at least explained in places it wasn't). There were a few instances where i did kinda scratch my head. Alot of these are small things that i wont mention. Some of these include:<br />1) A bear running off a cliff.<br />2)(as Pointed out in another review here): Characters refusal to finish the carving. He even admits it is crucial... and then kinda forgets about it.<br />3) The end combat: Yes, the best fighter of that country didn't know how to hold a sword.<br />4) Early in the book a character stumbles on a camp with dead bodies. However he never mentions the head of his friend when talking to the main character.<br />5) An army loses its seige weapons. Instead of attacking the lightly defended city in which the guy they want dead is in, they instead attack two heavily fortified cities... doesn't make much sense.<br />6) The book is presented as the main character telling his story to the scribe. So you would assume that everything you read the scribe hears/records. Not true. While i understand why he didn't have it this way, it did create a disfunction that could of been avoided.<br /><br />-[Preluding/Narrative Knowledge:] THIS WAS MY BIGGEST issue with the book.<br />When i read large books like this im always trying to read between the lines, to understand the mysteries and the hidden thoughts that the author is trying to get across. To me this is what makes a book enjoyable to read, the intellectual stimulation and mysteries. This book took a different approach. Almost every major chapter ended with some kind of preluding similar to the following: \\"If only he had realized the significance of ....\\" \\"He didn't know he wouldn't see her for another 5 years...\\" \\"Later he would wonder if he had payed more attention if....\\". You get the picture. In my opinion these take away from the novel. If you want the reader to understand something then gently nudge them in that direction, don't kick them off the ledge.<br /><br />Other preluding existed in the way of the scribe who is recording the story (more on this below).<br /><br />[Positives Below]:<br /><br />Mainly these are alot of individual ideas, so im just going to list instead of sorting into categories.<br />-The book was original. More and more newer fantasy novels seem to bring alot of elements from older works (Eragon comes to mind).<br />-The plot/storyline was engaging. The author has the art of storytelling down. Fix the few issues above and it would be a 5 star book.<br />-The book wasn't one dimensional: ie it wasn't a story of endless fights. The author does a good job of balancing action and detail. Something that sometimes get overlooked.<br />-I really enjoyed it. The author does a good job with a single POV character.<br /><br />[Neutral]<br />-I wasn't sure what to think of the scribe who is listening to the story. At times i thought it helped advance the novel since he brought in a different perspective. At other times the passages seem to give away to much information or to disrupt the stories flow.<br />-The ending seemed rushed.<br /><br />The fact that this book has gained 80+ 5 star ratings in the last week, all practically saying the same thing, might be artificially inflated.

B001LRJH0U|5.0|Ed Harris has made one of the best westerns of the last 20 years.<br />I think it's as good as Pale Rider or Forgiven. Viggo Mortensen<br />is perfect as his sidekick. Jeremy Irons plays a great villain which<br />he has played many times. Harris filmed this in a way that it feels<br />like a real western and not some hollyweird gloss over studio<br />production. His acting, directing and writing shows his talent<br />and years of experience that most hollyweirdos today don't<br />have and never will have. He uses just enough action and<br />violence needed but not over done with blood and gore but<br />very realistic. The surrounding cast is excellent and Zellweger<br />who is one of the few really talented actresses in hollyweird<br />plays the part of Harris's love interest and plays it well. I<br />think this is the best western since Pale Rider and probably<br />the last great western that will ever be made! These kind of<br />actors and writing are vanishing from hollyweird! It's a shame.

0848833031|3.0|I'm a huge fan of the Dexter series. I have all of the seasons on DVD, posters, T-shirts, and all of Lindsay's Dexter books. When I say that the show is better than the book, believe me, I mean just that.<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT***<br /><br />Why? For starters, Dexter in the novel is boring, heartless, and somewhat disgusting. He melted a guy's remains in ACID for christ sake! To me, that just doesn't seem like the \\"the friendly neighborhood serial killer that everyone likes\\". Not only that but he calls Rita an \\"idiot\\" and the kids are showing signs of serial killing too. I'm sorry, but the investigation's are interesting but the actual side-action, not so much. I know I'm not a scholar when it comes to writing but I figured since I bought all of his books without reading reviews on them first, I'm entitled to post a review about them.<br /><br />So with that said, stick to Showtime Dexter. He's likeable, somewhat funny, has actual FEELINGS (even though they are very limited) and isn't boring. The book just doesn't grab my attention. The opening of the book actually made me want to scream while listening to it on audiobook (I work as a data entry operator so it's easier for me to listen).<br /><br />The reason I gave this book 3 stars was basically because of the killings. The murders were very interesting to me and well thought out but I just can't get past how incredibly horrible Lindsay's writing style is. Deb is always screaming \\"GODD@MN!\\" Which I'm not religious at all but I believe that she shouldnt have \\"shit or bastard\\" in every sentence that comes out of her mouth.  Dexter is always saying how he isn't \\"Human\\". I don't believe human is the word for it, more like \\"not average\\" or \\"not normal\\". I don't know. This book just disappointed me like the other two.<br /><br />I'll stick with the show.<br /><br />TL;DR: Don't waste your money. You'll be disappointed.
1455113549|4.0|SPOILER ALERT: I wish the ending would have cleared up whether Jacob was the killer. It certainly leaves that impression, but it is never explicit.
B007G51UV0|4.0|Great features, quality components, but this board is seriously let down by the ASUS software.  The Wifi Go setup of DNLA crashed the AI suite everytime until I uninstalled the Wifi Go.  Hopefully a few revisions to the software will improve the performance.  In basic monitoring and automatic performance tuning the software is acceptable, though.<br /><br />Component-wise, the board is excellent.  The layout which puts the front audio header at the farthest point from the front of the PC was not well thought out, but the DIMMs are spaced well and allow for most after-market cooling solutions without losing RAM (Depending on the RAM, you may need to remove huge, spiky heatsinks.)  Lots of headers, including a USB 3.0 header so you don't have to resort to a cheesy pass-through.<br /><br />I don't know if I would buy the Pro version again, and the AI software suite leaves much to be desired, but performance-wise and quality wise this motherboard is excellent.  If ASUS improves their software it is a can't miss.

B005VMVUAQ|3.0|It's my fervent hope that someday I'll see a review that cuts right to the chase and tells us if they simply enjoyed the film (or not), lists a couple of reasons for either side, and doesn't insist on picking apart each camera angle, the actors' individual abilities (or lack of same), and the ineptitude of the various directors and writers.  Makes me wonder why these film \\"experts\\" aren't out in Hollywood themselves and writing and directing movies that meet their own obviously higher standards - instead of so arduously ripping into the work of others.<br /><br />With respect to \\"Trespass\\".... if you enjoy Nicholas Cage's acting in general, you'll probably enjoy this movie.  Although it's pretty much an \\"average\\" movie all the way around, it does have entertainment value.  If you're in the mood for something profound, just find another movie to watch tonight.<br /><br />That about covers it!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|To prove Rush's musicianship in the sense that they can sound just as amazing using second rate equipment, Raskulinecz insisted that for this new ablum, Lifeson use a 2002 Fender Squier Bullet and 2007 Daisy Rock 3/4\\" scale guitar (Which he had purchased for his daughter's 8th birthday from Walmart no less). Lee was limited to a 1998 Rogue bass guitar with an alder body and black on chrome hardware. In speaking of the Daisy Rock, Lifeson said, \\"So he (speaking of Raskulinecz)handed me this pink glittery stringy piece of SH*T thing to play that I guess had belonged to his daughter or something. At first I was like WFT Raskulinecz? Get this G*D D*MN thing out of my face! I mean, even the smell of the substandard woods was causing me to nauseate. But Raskulinecz, being the pro that he is, said - Look Al, If you can record the entire album on this thing, I promise you it will be the best work you have ever done in your entire life - YES, you will have to work twice as hard to get what you want out this shitar (that is what he called it), but the extra work will show in the music. Well dammit, he was right! I mean I had Quadruple triple effect racks hooked up to this half-donkey-assed guitar when I recorded the solo for The Garden, and that may be quite possible the best solo I have ever tracked to date! It's like the strings were so fricken' hard to bend and the strenuous effort really comes through on that song.\\" Lee on the other hand had his own problems with the Rogue bass. The D string machine head had stripped completely out of its' bolt hole and kept popping the string out and catching Lee on the side of the face leaving a pompourous welt. At one point during the recording of The Anarchist - about two minutes in to be exact, the string snapped yet again. Lee grabbed the string and charged Raskulinecz. Lifeson stepped in and calmed Lee down. Peart offered Lee some of his Gorilla Glue and well, the rest is history. As for using the Daisy Rock live, Lifeson said, \\"Iwould rather cut Raskulinecz wrists and then stitch them back up so I can cut them yet again...\\"
B005LAIH2W|1.0|This movie is absolutely as bad as the reviews said it was. But I wanted to see it anyway because of the SFX. Alas, each and every effects scene came suspiciously close to a copyright infringement of Star Wars. Nothing original here. So buy it if you must, but otherwise this is a definite \\"avoid at all costs.\\" Sad, really. Could have been great.

B005MYEQ4U|5.0|It had been nearly 25 years since I checked out a new Woody Allen film. I was a huge fan of his work in the late 60's and the 1970's but for the most part Woody kinda lost me after that. When \\"Midnight in Paris\\" was released about a year or so ago a friend call me raving about it.  He didn't tell me a whole lot about the film but assured me that I would love it.  So I took a day off and made it my business to check out this flick.  And  although there only about 10 people in the theater that June morning I wanted to stand up and cheer when they rolled the credits. For me \\"Midnight In Paris\\" was a sheer delight.  I knew from the get-go that this was a movie that I definitely wanted to own.<br /><br />\\"Midnight In Paris\\" stars Owen Wilson as aspiring novelist Gil Pender and Rachel McAdams as his lovely fiancee Inez. The couple are visiting \\"The City of Light\\" with Inez's parents. Gil and Inez seem very much in love as the film opens but cracks quickly begin to develop in the relationship. Gil is a successful Hollywood screenwriter who has simply become bored with his work and dreams of living and working in Paris the way the great artists and writers of the 1920's did. Inez has other ideas. She longs for the glamorous life in Malibu with all of the amenities. Inez is definitely going to be high maintenance. Gil feels at one with this place and wants to explore the streets of the city and savor the essence of Paris. Inez prefers to go off with friends and take in the art galleries and museums. They are slowly drifting apart. Gil's life would forever change one evening when at the stroke of midnight a limo pulls up alongside him and the occupants invite him to join them. Suddenly and remarkably Gil finds himself smack dab in the middle of the 1920's Paris he has always read and dreamed of. Furthermore he has the opportunity to meet and greet several of the legendary figures who were living in Paris at that time. That list would include writers Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and T.S. Eliot, the legendary songwriter Cole Porter along with jazz great Josephine Baker and a group of artists including Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali and Paul Gauguin. Gil desperately wants to show Inez what he has been experiencing but only he is allowed to enter into this bizarre netherworld. During his travels Gil also meets a ravishing young lady named Adriana (Marion Cotillard) with whom he has much in common. Here finally is a place where he feels fulfilled. Meanwhile, as you might expect all of these improbable events do not bode well for the future of Gil and Inez's relationship.<br /><br />I simply cannot overstate how much I enjoyed \\"Midnight In Paris\\". The views of Paris both during the day and at night were nothing short of stunning.  The photography alone makes this film worth owning.  Furthermore, in the finest tradition of Woody Allen films the music was also tremendous. There are a whole host of great selections from that era. The acting was superb and the writing top drawer. Woody Allen has outdone himself this time.  \\"Midnight In Paris\\" is one of those rare films that can be enjoyed by teens and seniors and everyone in between. Very highly recommended!Fitzgerald, and T.S.

B007NESBK2|5.0|One of the great things about owning Ms. Adu's concerts is that when played on a decent surround system, the music comes across loud and clear.  While Sade and her bandmates obviously deliver, some credit must go to director Sophie Muller and her crew.  They avoid the quick edits so often used these days and sometimes garish lighting.  Instead she blends the soft lighting and focuses on whoever is the lead at the time.<br /><br />Mostly that's Sade of course.  Her music is always driven by a thumping bass note throughout, delivered by the great Paul S. Denman.  Equally adept at sax or lead guitar, Stuart Matthewman is also worth highlighting.  In fact this entire ensemble is worthy of individual recognition.  They are tight!<br /><br />Sade goes through several fashion changes before hitting the slinky white cocktail dress followed by one in red.  Her bare feet are the perfect footwear for these dresses.  Early on Sade dons a pantsuit with her hair tied up.  The music is what it's all about and she delivers.  With a nice mix of classics and newer material I was especially taken with \\"Love is Found,\\" an upbeat song with slashing guitars.  Sade looks and sounds as good as ever.  I never get tired of her.<br /><br />The Blu ray disc is as close as you'll get to being there.  The video is presented in 1080p with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  The concert looks very good especially given the limited lighting.  Close ups are excellent with fine detail.  The audio is the thing here.  The availability of DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 is a big improvement over the Dolby Digital 5.1 option.  Also, there is an lossless PCM in old fashion stereo for those who like that option.  Most of the action is in the main speakers with the surrounds picking up on the audience and some reflective atmospherics.  Hopefully you have a subwoofer or two connected to get the full effect of Denman's bass work, occasionally as a lead instrument.

0151013837|5.0|The author begins the book very slow, however very descriptive. His style was very detailed and very easy to understand.  For some reviewers who have critiqued the author's style as being too \\"wordy\\" in some sections of the book, I have to digress. I think the author's descriptive style is what made the story, a good story. I think that most of the parts emphasized touched on questionable items such as religion, god, and life. A definite must read.

B005V2EVBQ|2.0|Just an unattractive piece of hard plastic that adds bulk to the Fire. It does what it's supposed to do as far as I can tell, and if it were offered for $6.99 I'd say go for it if you're looking for something low end to protect your Fire from damage. But for the almost $40 I paid, or for the almost $30 they're asking now, I would expect the case to feel better to the touch and mold itself to the Fire in some way, like with a \\"click in\\" feature. I use the Fire lying down, so I don't use the stand features of cases, so I can't comment on that. For me, after 2 days it went into a junk drawer.  Again, that's not to say it doesn't \\"work\\", it's just not particularly well-designed, clever or attractive like so many other cases out there these days.

1451608659|4.0|With the Summer Olympics 2012 fast approaching, this is the perfect time to get to really know a past olympic superstar, Dominique Moceanu in Off Balance. Readers will remember Dominique as she was a member of the 1996 Women's Olympic Gymnastics team known as the \\"Magnificent Seven\\". People know Dominique as one of the greatest gymnastics but what people probably don't know about Dominique is the person, mom, wife, sister, and daughter. In Off Balance Dominique shares a personal look at her life growing up, how she discovered her passion for gymnastics, making the olympic team and finding out she had a sister.<br /><br />This is a great memoir. I tend to usually stay away from memoirs, only because I don't really want to read about other peoples lives unless it is omeone that I really like. Only because if I find out things I do not like or find the bookk to be dry, then it takes away some for me on that person. None of this was the case with this book. I liked that Dominique made sure that the readers got to know her parents as they are an important part of the story. Dominique could have just briefly glossed over who they were and just focused on her gymnastic career but she did not.<br /><br />Jennifer was great. I like that Dominique was her idol and the reason why she wanted to do gymnastics. I would have liked to get to know her better in this book but what I did get to learn of her, I thought she had a great personality. Wow, what Dominque had to endure during her grueling training sessions with Bela Karolyi was amazing. It paid off in the end. Although, a sad time for someone as young as Dominique to have to deal with for a coach, even if he was one of the best. I read this book in one sitting. Off Balance scores gold!
