B0042TV4IW|4.0|Not completed yet, but looking forward to it, may rate it higher when I see it to the end of the series
B0094K1PW4|5.0|We just love this movie.<br />The more we watch Super 8, the more we love it.<br />Just buy it - now.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This is a real feel good film. Well developed characters, superb acting and clever translation choices makes for an enjoyable film.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|If you like Judd Apatow moveis and find them very funny, you will be very disappointed in this movie.  It is unfunny.  Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd are just whiny and complainers who are annoying to watch.<br /><br />Skip this movie and go mow your lawn.
B00B2TUKI0|5.0|Madeliene Peyroux has a wonderful voice and reminds me very much of Billie Holiday.  I recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys soothing songs.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|As a fan of foreign film, I bought this movie as it did not have the look and feel of typical &#34;cookie cutter&#34; Americana films.  I was not disappointed.  The cinematography was excellent, the casting and acting was superb, and a realistic ending.  Very well produced and excellent movie.  Must have addition to any movie lovers collection; even a foreign film lovers collection.
1616550414|5.0|This book would have to be one of the best gifts someone could give to a Zelda fan. For those serious fans, this book has rough sketches of all the characters from all of the games, from The Legend of Zelda, to Skyward Sword, this book covers it all. The untold history, the unexplained mysteries and wonders of Hyrule, Termina, Skyloft and more. This book is sure to entertain for hours, it holds countless surprises just waiting to be explored. Read this book, and prepare to look at the Zelda games in a whole new light.
B003Q6D27S|4.0|I owned the entire serious of films and therefore felt compelled to buy the last one? of this franchise.  Overall I was impressed with the film as it wrapped up some &#34;loose ends&#34; as well as providing further insight and clarification into the events of the past films in the series.  A must have for those who have invested in this series/franchise.
B008220DGE|4.0|This was a very different DVD set and it even came with a picture postcard of Phillip Seymour Hoffman in his Lancaster Dodd persona!  Joaquin Phoenix plays Freddie a WWII naval vet who appears to have PTSD or what they used to call \\"shell-shock.\\"  He is fascinated with a sand castle made to look like a naked woman and he has weird fantasies.  He is examined by the Naval shrink then sent to a Naval hospital then sent back to the states.<br /><br />He takes a job in a department store photo studio and loses his job when he gets violent with one of his customers.  He flees and ends up working the fields and making \\"illegal\\" alcohol like products.  One of the workers drinks from his flask and is poisoned so he flees again.<br /><br />He ends up on the boat of Lancaster Dodd who turns out to be like an L. Ron Hubbard type character running a cult that is like the Church of Scientology.  Dodd realizes that Freddie has issues and uses his unorthodox means to try to treat him and possibly cure him.<br /><br />Freddie is a drunk who gets into constant trouble and even with Dodd's treatments, he still gets violent at times for no reason.  Freddie is a very dark character and Dodd appears to be a shyster with a big cult following.  The two actors are amazing in their roles but the film seems to go off on a tangent and things never seem to resolve with Freddie.  I can't decide if this was a really good film because it seemed hard to understand at times and also dragged in some places.  I still give it four out of five stars.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|My wife and I (mid 40's) really enjoyed the movie, although it was a tear jerker at times. It makes you think and the story telling aspect of the movie was quite entertaining; as I never felt bored (and I thought I would be).
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I truly loved the story and how it is so different what a great new way to treat supernatural in fact I loved the first book Beautiful Creatures  so much that I am now reading Beautiful Darkness and enjoying the continued story that envolves love friendship and family with a whole new perspective !!!
B00BMVTS1S|4.0|Excellent product.  Movie is wonderful. Movie not as crisp and clear as I would like it to be, but, still very good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game for adults as well as children. Really enjoy playing this. My grandchildren really enjoy it also,
B000N2HBSO|4.0|The book exhaustively and biographically examines Lincolln and his cabinet with particular attention to Seward, Chase and Stanton.. Boodwin's focus is not on onthe surrounding cwar and and it its prquel but rather the princiupals including Stephen Douglas. Nonetheess, there are tedious portions of the book relating to what I think are not relvevant to the major issues of the Civil War such as entertainment and  the interaction of the variious women. Lincolln is picrtured as almost a saint with a diffuclt wife whose personality is spelled out in detqail.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|The songs are all good as well as the performance. I look forward to seeing this group perform on tour!!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The book is a well written and legally authentic story of a teenager charged with murder. His father an assistant district attorny confronted with the dillemma of his young son charged with murder he is investigating. Is this son a psyc9opath responsible for murder. Is there such a thing as genitically caused  criminallity? This book explores the issue and the ending is unerving and fascinating.
0783225849|5.0|This is an amazing film by an amazing director. It is my all time favorite movie and I have watched it so many times I don't think I can even count! This is a must see.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Good story; challenging puzzle configurations; nice graphics; lots of interesting fun facts; no glitches. I can easily get lost in this game and pleasantly while away an evening. I recommend this for anyone who likes match 3 puzzles. Definitely worth the $3.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book is so fantastic. You might be able to guess the ending, but the twists and turns are fabulous. I'm a 90's kid, so now I want to go watch and play all the awesome 80's stuff included in the book.
B003719G40|5.0|My boyfriend had read this and thought it would be a good idea that I learn about us both. After reading this I now know how to relate to him more better.  I would suggest this book to all couples.
B000XUBF3I|5.0|Sink Reflections isn't just another organization book.  I have been a flybaby for 12 years. For me to stick to something this long, it has to be good!  My home isn't perfect, neither is my life; however, it doesn't need to be for me to be a happy person.<br /><br />Marla Cilley's book has changed me 15 minutes at a time. Sink Reflections has helped me overcome my perfectionism. I can see the possibilities in my life instead of the impossibilities.<br /><br />The world is a better place for her attitude and she has passed it along to her Flybabies the world over.  Wouldn't it be great if we all flew w/ the FlyLady.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book enough to see more by this author.  I wanted to keep reading, kept my attention.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I very rarely give 5 stars to a novel.  This collection certainly merits it.  It has everything. Overarching mystery, complete plot unpredictability, romance, very real and sexy characters, thrilling action, unbelievably vivid world and most importantly, superb writing style that just draws one in.  Wow. I think Hugh Howey has joined Larry Niven and Poul Anderson as my favorite sci-fi authors of all time. Wow.
B0011UJMK2|3.0|A different type of reading material for me but I still found it an interesting read into a different time of life.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|first off I'm getting a little sick about reading reviews on your broke @$$ kindle, your not here to complain about how YOU cant keep it running correctly, your here to review the software. the game is great, runs smooth as glass on kindle first gen.bright, fast, easy controls. lots of unlockables!?!? it may be the FAOD, but would have paid if I saw it before. its good to know that someone is still making fun games that run this well.
B00846REIS|5.0|Very easy read, very sexual -- my favorite type of book to relax & enjoy while reading it.<br /> I could. 'see & feel' evey thing that was happening.  To me, that means a good author was<br />at work.
B006G2124E|5.0|I'll keep this review short, sweet and to the point.  I love this movie.  Every time I'm channel surfing and happen to catch it- I end up watching it again straight through to the end every time.  Love it. Love it. Love it. :)
B008OOYALE|4.0|Those dragons are adorable and the best part is visiting the other players dragons and playing with them as they make the cutest sounds. Since I am nog a child my interest in this game is not so much but I sure would recommend this for kids.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This book was a little too much blood for me. It was depressing for me to read..never continued with others
B009KEN87O|5.0|Easy to play and very addicting! It is just like old games in the arcade or an Atari game. Very fun!
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Great plot; easy reading; emotional story; it really touched me deep inside. Could not put book down, Excellent characters; a lot learned about other religions
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I was downloading this game for my 2year old and now we are fighting to play it lol...please create more fun games!
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|I always enjoy a good seek and find gamed. Best part I got while it was a free app of the day.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I loved it when it first came out.  My wife recently began the series and is now addicted to it!  The mystery, intrigue, and suspense of this series is great.  The shows really leave you waiting for, and wanting more!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is an awesome time killer.  No better way to waste away the time than running from a giant mutant monkey. The funny thing is my 3 yr old is the one that showed it to me. She had played it with the baby sitters kids.  Now I'm hooked.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Very enlightening and right on time. A must read for working women! Provides practical insights that can be applied right away
B0098VYCCE|1.0|The first mistake was casting Kristen Stewart, the most overrated actress of her time. Her best role was when she was almost in a diabetic coma in Panic Room. Charlize Theron does evil well but this movie just was a snorefest for me.
B00985E3UG|5.0|After reading this book, I'm reminded of the words going back to Watergate. &#34;Follow the money.&#34;  Never will I trust food manufacturers again, and certainly not the lapdogs of the industry, the FDA. That being said, it will be a real challenge to find a diet that really works and doesn't make me want to shoot myself from never having the foods I love. Once I get through the first five or six years of rice cakes and distilled water, I won't miss the processed foods and their overwhelming loads of salt, sugar and fat.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Who doesn't love Meryl Streep? Does she do anything wrong? But the pairing with Tommy Lee Jones was just genius. His dry sense of humor and delivery was perfect for this movie.  I'm not even 40 yet and I still loved this movie.<br />Recommend it to your folks they will love it.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Several really good tunes.  Probably 4 or 5 that could easily be on the radio and very popular.  Good music @ a great price.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|I thought a movie with Logan Marshall-Green couldn't be so bad since I could just watch his scenes and drool and at least that might be great but no. I was freaking wrong. This movie was awful even Charlize Theron was terrible in it. Maybe I don't get it but I did not get the appeal of this movie at all.
B00BYOEZTI|2.0|I'm going to be honest despite what you think. The acting is five stars, the plot is a zero. The story is all over the place, not like The Lord Of The Rings.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I did not expect to like this movie, I mean it's a talking Teddy Bear for goodness sake. But it was downright hilarious. If you like raunchy humor this movie will not disappoint.
B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|I am a really big Lord of the Rings fan and when I heard that this the Hobbit trilogy was being filmed I was very excited as I'm sure many people were. This not a long review nor am I about to provide a professional film critic point of view as many try to do here.<br /><br />The movie simply is not up to par with the LOTR collect collection, in my opinion they did made the same misktake as star-wars peisode 1 and tried to force comedy into what would otherwise be a darker movie. The first 30/40 min of the movie are the worst with unnecessary songs and a kitchen scene that is so ridiculous is a shame to even include in the movie.<br /><br />There are many really good parts in the movie that make it good, it sure is nice to see how it all started but again at timea I feel they go too far with their efforts to keep us entertained and lighten up the story.<br /><br />I bought it without havig watched it first and I regret doing it. This is in .y opinion no more than a good rental.
B005W8SNNG|1.0|I love all the people in this movie but not even the sexy Justin Timberlake could ever save this disaster of a movie.
B004UNX1LS|2.0|Wish it would work. Just as well, a few minutes into it and it closes up on me. Kindle Fire hd.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game my children love! Another reason we love this game is because its kind of addictive! This is a WONDERFUL game!
B0067R0APK|2.0|Do not see help option. Can not see where I can delete a location. Surprised that paid app is so buggy.
B00AOMR2S2|5.0|I went with the Deluxe Edition due to the few extra tracks it offers over the regular edition.  I wasn't disappointed.  Love this soundtrack.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun and addictive...  challenging... just like playing at the fair or carnival... downside is not enough coins at one time...
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Excellent! Can't wait to see how Diana and Matthew do in the 16th century. I love how the author has entwined all the different creatures together!
B00005N6KG|4.0|I use these [[ASIN:B00005N6KG Sony Ultra Lightweight MDR-W08L Vertical In-The-Ear Headphones]] all the time.  They work perfectly, although they won't fully satisfy an audiophile.  If you check the specs, the frequency response would suggest they are nothing special, but I find they produce fairly good, rich sound, especially when properly situated on one's head -- the head band is nice & flexible so this shouldn't be a problem for most people, but if you leave them too loose, or hang 'em off the back of your head, then you'll miss some of the sound.  I haven't read many of the reviews, but, people who complain about bass response are either way too fond of cranking up the bass, or they have their device set wrong, or aren't wearing them right.<br /><br />On the flipside, of course, the drawback to the design is, there's only one way to wear them (upright), which may interfere with your style, or your activity, etc.  But these are so cheap, you can easily afford a different set for other activities, or for more serious listening, if you're looking for higher-quality sound.<br /><br />For my part, I don't like earbuds because they slide around, failing to project the sound properly into my ear; & I reject in-ear 'phones (whatever you call the kind you shove into your ear canal) because 1) I'm old fashioned, 2) ear wax??, 3) I don't find them comfortable, 4) great way to block out ambient noises that maybe you DO want to hear (I suppose I might use them someday, for an airplane flight, but I'd rather use some good noise-cancelling, ear-covering headphones for that), and 5)... I don't stick things in my ear canal that aren't earplugs.<br /><br />These fit the bill, because (pros:) they fit my head, they get the sound nicely into my ear, without covering my ear/flattening my ear like old-style headphones.  And they're very light.  Sound quality is good-to-very good.  And they're really cheap for being as good as they are.<br /><br />Side note:  they are a significant improvement over the (often derided) standard Apple ear buds, the ones that come with iPods.<br /><br />Cons:  1) unreasonably short cord, although this may be a plus if you use them for jogging, but in my experience they slip out of place while doing most kinds of physical activity.  2) They are somewhat fragile; I've bent the plastic headband out of shape in the past (squashed by something in a backpack), and, my children have destroyed a couple pairs, one time by chewing on the earpiece part and one time by yanking on the cord where it enters the earpiece (so, maybe not great for parents with young children, except they are cheap to replace when they _do_ get broken).
B005GFPZYK|2.0|It doesn't keep your attention. Wordy....<br /><br />His ghost writer could have been a lot better.<br /><br />I did not finish it.
B000LJB9U0|5.0|Well, I'm a fan of the roles that C. Walken plays in these types of movies. Somewhat other worldly, on another plain, very intelligent, sensitive. In this particular movie, I like the romantic side of CW getting back together with his wife played by a very gorgeous Natalie Wood. Also, it's shows a woman playing a dominant role in Louise Fletcher which was not that prevalent in movies before that time
B000NQRE0K|5.0|Mel Gibson outdid himself in this fabulous film! It was like watching history being made in front of my eyes. I felt every cut and blow that Gibson felt in the movie. Tears ran freely when they finally killed him.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|My kids loved it.  It was beautifully made and touches many emotions.  We watched it for a family night movie.  Connected to all.
B0036EH3TS|5.0|Bruce Willis and company did a tremendous job in this great film about a giant asteroid threatening the Earth. Love every minute of it. The price was great, and so was the service.
B005IQZB14|3.0|The book was wild in language and the way the woman acted. I just couldn't connect with the main character and like her trudging along the PCT, I had to trudge through the book to get through. MD
B001BN1ZHW|5.0|I was looking forward to watching this movie since my friend Teddy play the part in a play. Bloody as heck!! Love it! The price was just right. Thanks, Amazon.
B009NNG202|1.0|I kept thinking it would get better if I just Hung in there. But, it was pointless. Loved the costumes, and scenery. But, disappointing.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|It was a good movie the plot is good, teh cast is great. The make over to make Gordon-Levitt look like a younger Willis is a little silly.
B001CC7PPI|4.0|Amazing results when a director is in love with his leading lady!!  Beyond Kelly's wardrobe & Hitchcock's lovemaking with her via his &#34;lens&#34;, the standout performance as always, is Thelma Ritter's!!!!  While Ms. Kelly pouts over Stewart's lack of interest & as she struts about as if on a Seventh Avenue runway (I kept waiting for her to give the price of the ensemble she was wearing, as they use to do at store fashion shows years ago!!), it's Ms. Ritter who adds some balls to the script.  Admit it; Thelma Ritter was a great actress!!!  Ms. Kelly was an incredible mannequin!!  A Philadelphia bricklayer's daughter, to be sure!!  Anyway, the movie is a success at making you tense up & keeping you &#34;in&#34; the story!  No one did that better than Hitchcock!  Strange as he was, still a great director...a style long gone, now that we crave special effects and lighting, so minimal you can barely see what's going on, on screen!!
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|As much as I loved David T. as the Doc I really would have like to see Chris get one more season in. I like the series and this the the beginning of the new era
B001GKJ2DE|5.0|i am so in love with angelina and thats why i had to get the collectors set. great product, great service.
B004W2UBYW|3.0|Very well written, but I had a little difficulty with time frames. I am not personally familiar with all of the events and had some trouble following the involvement of each person described in the book.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Wow! A total bounce back from season 3. How can so many things happen to one motorcycle club? This show is incredible.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|So easy to bid, list, and sell. A little different than using the regular format but no problem getting the hang of it. Great app!
B00BESLHEA|1.0|Russell Crowe just picked up the check for making this film to pay for his jenny Craig much needed weight lost. He's so fat.Plus he cannot act anymore. And Lucy Lei just horrible. She should quit
031618201X|5.0|Not that I was expecting it to be bad! I haven't read the book yet, but after finishing the first volume of this manga series I really want to! I just random picked this one up, realized what it was and decided to give it a try. And I'm really glad that I did! The art, story, and characters flow really well, I liked the romance and romance. Alexia was awesome from page one, and Lord Conall Maccon was a great love interest! I really like the new spin on vampires (making them into a hive, like bees with a queen, that's so clever) and the werewolves were awesome!<br /><br />This artist is not too shy with showing some skin (nudity, or Lord Conall Maccon nudity) and I wasn't bothered by it or anything, in fact I was surprised an artist actually had the guts to do actual male nudity (from the back, but still, it's rare to see in regular manga (although this would be Manhwa, wouldn't it?) The sexy scenes were good, definitely made for an older audience!<br /><br />Overall, great series! I highly recommend it! And I hope to have all the volumes on my manga bookcase in the near future.
B00BDAP66E|2.0|I need it but it still needs work. Will not load every so often. Network error when should not have one.
B00A77II0U|4.0|This game was really fun. It was a pretty long download but worked well, except for a few times when I was doing the right thing and it wouldn't register.
1451695195|4.0|It was fascinating to see how Dr. Alexander changed from a non-believer to a true believer in a good God.
B005K17RU0|5.0|seems I am never around the tv at weather time...great to check in any  where I am accessing my kindle
B003VANOFY|3.0|Might've been a faulty batch of plastic, but after about a year and a half of about 10 hrs/week usage the plastic kind of flakes and crumbles off in various places where things have seams and are bolted together.  I would've expected this to last a little longer for the price we paid.
B00632HWOG|5.0|any where I go can keep up with my mail. Dpn't need my computer with me and easiy accessible  from my  kindle
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|this is very addictive and hours of fun even in the time mode very interesting  only problem is crashes occassionally
B002ZBN13A|5.0|This is a the first album by Evanescence and it is really good. I have been listening to them for years and when I saw this album on sale I just had to get it.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|thiz game is super cool and if you like sharks then your going to love this game. its easy to play and just plan fun. its amazing!
B00BLGZUR0|5.0|This was better than expected. kept watching the previous for it and kept thinking if I thought was worth my time. it turned out it was worth my time, so much so, I got the blue ray for it, as well as I am a movie collector. action was good, acting was sufficient, but could be better. It was not a one person movie, it was an effort by them all, where they all stand out as actors and the history, although I'm not sure it was true, knowing that possibility that if it was or could have been was scary so, take some time and watch it, won't disappoint!
B007HC3LHS|4.0|First time to read Elizabeth Haynes and I really like the way she writes. I will be looking for somemore of her books.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This the best app ever! you buy and name your horse! you can also be in compatishens! the marcit is fun to
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|I find this dictionary to be very helpful and easy to use. I like the fact that I can use the audio in order to properly pronounce words that I do not know.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|This is just so well done. :)  Hugh Jackman did so well, as did Eddie Redmayne, Amanda Seyfried, and Anne Hathaway!  so great!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is a good book you just read it on your own to find out how good(:hi hi hi hi
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|A very interesting look at how generational and technolgy changes are affecting all areas of life and particularly our counterespionage efforts.
B0039PPW60|3.0|Needed 4 separate channels, only got 2 to work. Quality product otherwise. Wish it would have been what i was looking for.
B00005KB9X|5.0|Despite 39 years have passed, the album remained as great as it used to be.  Bob Marley was a miracle.
0517548232|5.0|This is very informative and a must read to anyone who wants to understand basic economics. Some chapters may have to read more than once. It certainly reveals the fallacies we are besieged with almost daily in the mainstream media.
B00003000M|5.0|The idea that the children of Marley had to put this together was an excellent idea.  Listening to this album with a mix of contemporary sound makes you feel like Bob Marley is still around, jamming with the rest of us.  Great Job!  Stephen Marley.
B00BF11STU|3.0|If you think this is a story about killing UBL, you would be mistaken.  There is very little on the preparation and actual assault on the compound.  The final scenes of the actual assault are very good and have less action, but more realistic, than other films. The introduction sets the tone for the rest of the movie, overly drawn out in an attempt to create drama with very little build up.  The car bomb in Afghanistan was broadcast and lacked any impact.  Way too much time is spent around the feelings and emotions of the main character.<br /><br />This is the type of film I would watch, but kind of feel cheated I bought the disc. I don't see myself playing this over and over for relaxation or entertainment.
B00005MKA1|5.0|35 years ago this album was release, as with all Bob Marley's albums, his music never ends.  Chris Blackwell said people all over the world will continue to talk about Bob Marley and will continue to listen to his music because from the very beginning while he was promoting the Wailers, he felt like something MASSIVE was about to happen.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm with the masses on this one. There are a few things wrong with this book, but with almost 4,000 reviews it is still hovering at the 5 star mark. There are some complex themes, but they are not explored on a deep level. The ending was really not that awesome. The science was flawed and some of the rationale as to why things were the way they were was just not that compelling. For example if someone refuses to clean, why would the manual automatically assume a rebellion is underway? Similar explanations were somewhat superficial throughout the book.  Wool is sometimes referred to as Young Adult science fiction. The writing is definitely at a level that makes it accessible to a wide variety of readers. The bottom line here is that I could not put this book down. The characters were really well drawn and compelling, the universe of the silos and their strange ways was so incredibly interesting. I set aside a couple of Saturdays to get through it and I refused to touch it during the week because I knew I wouldn't be able to stop. About 10 pages into the story, I was hooked.  This was some of the most riveting writing I've read in a long long time. I absolutely loved it!! It was a truly entertaining read.
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|Sort of long in places liked the fact that he and his wife realize the way they have been treating each other,good life lesson there, and the kindness of most of the people he meets on the way.  Otherwise not an enjoyable read.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Reading about North Korea is so important for every U.S. citizen.  Their people live in such poverty and are struggling to exist.  This book about Camp 14 is so unbelievable.  This young man was born in the Camp and knew nothing about the outside world, much less knew that there was an outside world where freedom existed.  He did escape and bravely found help in South Korea and in the U.S.A.  However, he has a long way to go to free his mind.
B00B8PMWJI|4.0|Take it with a grain of salt on a wound. Imagine yourself being in bed and hitting the snooze a few times and in between every snooze you start having the most livid dreams. That's how I can describe what this one feels like. However if you have high expectations for some of the more renown directors, it seemed to fall short.  Have fun with it without pretense or even any knowledge of the film expect for a gory, gross laugh!
B00BBQXQFI|1.0|I can't even watch this the SD quality is so bad. I want to have a refund and I will buy the HD
B00BF11STU|2.0|I watched this movie two days ago.  I was tempted to comment on it just after watching but decided to wait until I was over my dissapointment, thinking that I might be more objective later.  Two days later, I still feel the same.  My objections to this movie have nothing to do with the subject matter or any political or moral implications it may have made.  In my opinion, the direction was really bad.  The photography could have been much better without much additional effort. I also felt that the sequences throughout the movie were somewhat disjoint.  Maybe a lot of the movie ended up on the cutting room floor.  In any case, my main reason for writing this review is to warn others to think twice before purchasing it.
0060012234|4.0|Russel Middlebrook is the only gay kid at Goodkind High School.<br /><br />He has to be.<br /><br />In a school so small, in a town so remote, Russel is convinced he'd know if there was anyone else navigating the same minefield of classes and locker rooms and pretending.<br /><br />Russel is alone.<br /><br />At least, he thought he was until a chat room buddy turns out to be not just a fellow student but someone Russel actually knows.<br /><br />And then he finds another friend who has been secretly dating her girlfriend for years.<br /><br />And her girlfriend has another friend.<br /><br />These kids have nothing in common except a desperate need to have someone to talk to--someone who understands. The only problem is that having nothing in common also means they have no reason to get together on a regular basis without attracting attention. It's not like they could start a club. . . . unless it's a boring club no one would want to join because it talks about geography at every meeting. Russel and his friends think they have all of their bases covered but things get way more complicated when their boring, unappealing club starts to get a lot of attention in Geography Club (2003) by Brent Hartinger.<br /><br />Geography Club is a standout book that is celebrating its tenth anniversary and is being adapted into a movie. It is also the first of Hartinger's books featuring Russel and his friends. (You can see more of them in The Order of the Poison Oak, Split Screen (which is two-stories-in-one) and the latest The Elephant of Surprise which came out this year).<br /><br />Books about gay protagonists and books featuring support systems like a Gay-Straight Alliance are much more common now, in 2013, than they were when this book was originally published in 2003. However Geography Club more than stands the test of time.<br /><br />More importantly, Geography Club is just a good story. Russel is a likable, witty narrator and Hartinger imbues his writing with humor and optimism even when Russel winds up in quite a few messes (who knew going on a date with a girl could cause so many problems down the road?).<br /><br />Geography Club is a quick, thoughtful read in which Russel answers a lot of hard questions and makes quite a few good jokes along the way.<br /><br />Possible Pairings: Keep Holding On by Susane Colasanti, Skinny by Donna Crooner, Fat Kid Rules the World by K.

B00821OX98|5.0|Falling Skies is an amazing TV show and I can't wait to see season 3.  This is best  Science-Fiction  TV show on Television.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I really like how they keep you woundering what is going to happen at the end of each episode.<br />It makes me think of what might happen if this ever does be come real for the human race.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I loved this book. I read it so fast because I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend this book!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|An enjoyable season to watch. I liked following all of the character lines. I can't wait until Season 3 is available free for Prime Members.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I know the book was suppose to be more on the erotic side but for me it was a little over kill. It got old after a while cause you could always predict what was about to happen.
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|this movie was fantastic! The hobbit and all the extra tidbits were great too! and the ease of renting was a big huge plus! it was easier than getting it in my directv!<br />and it was cheaper too. so i love my kindle fire!!<br />thank you,<br />glenna
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I've read most of Nicolas Sparks books and this one is an absolute favorite, one of this authors best.  The author completely captures the  flavor of a small North Carolina coastal town. The reader can easily imagine being there right beside the heroine.  T The heroine's story is captivating and mysterious and we meet a series of endearing and interesting characters as her story and background slowly unfold. The reader is horrified to be taken into the warped mind of a wife abuser and follow his convoluted rationale for his behavior.  As the plot unfolds, the reader sees the inevitable confrontation spinning to a boiling point,wants to do anything to stop the horrific turn of events, and cannot stop turning the pages in hopes of somehow averting events that are spinning out of control.  The reader cannot stop rooting for the heroine to somehow prevail and the ending will leave you breathless! Highly recommend.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved every chapter of this book. Never a dull moment. Loved the authors writing and very detailed in ever chapter.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|A great game of Angry birds especially for the Star Wars fan. Levels are challenging but fun. Game is easy enough for children but challenging for adults who are trying to get all the stars and bonuses. Unique birds with Star Wars based abilities gives the game a nice feel and differentiates it from previous titles
B003L77FYS|5.0|I love the show &#34;Castle.&#34;  I like having my own DVD so I can watch it anytime I want.  I've order many books, DVD, and CDs from Amazon.  I've always been very happy with the service I receive.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|Kudos to Martin for once again filling our need for more Game of Thrones.  Can't wait for the next installment.  Hurry up, George.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|I love this series. I also love the paranormal aspect to it as well. The characters are engaging and the plot line keeps me guessing what will happen next. Love the dragons!! I just bought the books, all six. Can't wait to start reading them!
B00BCOQSSQ|5.0|Great book from beginning to end. A world of imagination with original work. Loved every minute of it from beginning to end. A must have for any fantasy reader from young to old.
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|Great animation fun characters and a sweet story about finding ones self, a collection for any parent to own. BAMM!
B005LAIHR2|5.0|I thought this movie was going to be funny and all the funny parts were shown in the previews and it ended up being a horrible musical movie and a waste of money...wish I would of rented instead of paying full price for it.
B000ID3KU6|5.0|Great movie, great cast, great story<br />Bought this copy to replace the one I lent to another and told them to keep it as they loved it
B001R3YRG2|5.0|This is what happens when you get tired of your job and people are being pieces of crap and don't treat other people like crap when they don't realize what is going on in their lives. Of course this guy goes way way WAY overboard.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I had seen some information about this program, but wasn't sure it would be something I would enjoy.  On a lark I decided to, at least, look at the first episode.  From the first show I was hooked.  There is no doubt I will continue following the &#34;Abbey&#34; household until it no longer runs.  Smart, realistic, and interesting.<br /><br />No doubt I will express my appreciation of this series to all who will listen.
6304884419|5.0|A sweet flick I use to love to watch when I was younger. I love the scene when the bikers come to the bar talking s***  and are asked to leave and basically say screw you. Then they lock the door and say, now you can't leave and go one whooping some ass! Awesome movie!
B0008KLVGY|5.0|The anniversary edition has extras about the producer, director and the actors that I found fascinating and humorous.  I would highly recommend that anyone who enjoyed the movie purchase this Anniversary Edition.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|This movie I wasn't sure if it was going to be good or retarded and it ended up being a lot better than I thought. I actually really liked it because they made it more realistic, at least as realistic as a vampire movie can be.
0345803493|3.0|The book was okay........nothing earth shaking maybe because it was hyped up so much.  I'd recommend it just so you're up to date on all the talk about it.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|This game has challenged me to think almost every round. The music in it is great and the controls are easy to learn. The only reason I cant give this a 5 star is it has a level skip button. I don't believe in them you play until you beat the level in my opinion. And yes I have been stuck on a few levels for a day or to each.
0345803485|3.0|The first book was...eh......okay.....but it does get better and better as you get to the other two in the trilogy.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|It was pretty good but I didn't get to actually play the whole game because I only had the free version. From what I played though the levels were challenging and fun.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|If you are a Maeve Binchy fan than you will enjoy this book.  The author has her own unique style that keeps you interested from the beginning to the end but it has the same flavor of Ireland and the people living there.  An enjoyable read.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Trailer was funny and has the best scenes of the whole movie. Pathetic sad exaggeration of life in your 40's.
B001ESYAJY|5.0|After Casino Royale, Bond fans and soundtrack lovers were anticipating the next Daniel Craig film with David Arnold behind the musical journey. This time, the Bond music is more intense than in Casino, even though it's still got it's nostalgic, romantic moments (\\"What's Keeping You Awake?\\" \\"Forgive Yourself\\" \\"Camille's Story\\" & \\"I Never Left\\"). The truly new highlight behind the romantic veil is \\"Camille's Story\\" and the Vesper theme from Casino Royale makes it's way in a poignant and melancholic fashion throughout all of these songs.<br /><br />As for the fight or flee response, we are treated with even more material than in Casino Royale, pumping our adrenaline from the very first track (\\"Time To Get Out\\" \\"The Palio\\" \\"Pursuit at Port Au Prince\\" \\"Target Terminated\\" & \\"Perla de las Dunas\\"). The way David Arnold interweaves the different themes together is truly remarkable throughout the whole score.<br /><br />As for a more suspenseful mood you can listen to \\"No interest in Dominic Greene\\" and \\"Night at the Opera\\", both very good tracks in delivering this Bond detective feel.<br /><br />And the music used as introductions to changes in sceneries is just fantastic; \\"Inside Man\\" \\"Bond in Haiti\\" \\"Talamone\\" \\"Bolivian Taxi Ride\\" \\"Field Trip\\" \\"DC3\\" & \\"Oil Fields\\" all have a very unique appeal to them that truly evokes the Ian Fleming's character style.<br /><br />So there you have it... a complete Bond music feel. The only thing missing here is a memorable title song, but oh well, I suppose Bond wouldn't cry over this.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I don't like the terrible words. I don;t use that language and certainly don;t wont to read the awful words.<br />sorry  a waist of my money
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Not at all what I expected, and I'm just sorry that it took me so long to read it. I was completely captivated by the story and couldn't put it down. I'm extremely impressed with E L Jame's writing and how she weaves a story.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|There is only so much you can say that everybody else hasn't said an awards already shown! This is a wonderful wonderful  series with the best actors,story and beauty!! It picks up at end of season 1 one and takes you back to the family uo and down stairs. I love this era and this is it at it's best! Watch and enjoy! Buy and it's yours forever!!!
B005GIS1WA|5.0|I love birds and animated films. I enjoyed sharing this with my daughter. I am sure we will watch it many more times.
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|I was asked to try and find this movie so I did just that.  They watch it every day .
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Awesomely addictive. I really enjoy the look and feel of this game as well as the different levels. It's the third app I tried and it is definitely the  best!
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|We were expecting something pretty stupid, but had nothing better to do for a couple of hours. This was delightful! The alien was so funny. Lots of action, and gave you a little something to think about in the story line, too!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I like the unique portrait of the South that the authors give, as well as the imaginative and very pointed description of the caster world. The ending could have been better, but that's neither here nor there.
B00BL5YQKS|5.0|This was the show I never wanted to miss and never wanted to end. You were sucked in right away from the first moment and that carried all the way to the end of the pilot episode. Then you spent the rest of the season trying to figure out how Vic, Shane, Ronnie, and Lem would stay one step ahead of the crooks as well as their own colleagues. My only negative comment is that the season was only 13 episodes.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I found the story very enjoyable until three quarters through as it kept the pace and then I felt the story line fell off.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|This was an excellent story with some very good twists.  Fast-paced and highly readable.<br /><br />The characters were for the most part believable and as we learned more about them we could see the unraveling of Christine's life and the story that she believes.<br /><br />Would recommend.
B001OMJGD0|4.0|I grew up loving the first two Superman movies, but hated the third and fourth. This time, we are shown what happens five years after Superman II took place. The storyline was not what I expected, nor was it the best... However, fans of Christopher Reeve would be proud of the acting (and strangely similar mannerisms) that Brandon Routh portrayed in the title role.
B003LXM1RS|5.0|This is the Scissor sisters at their best! Love it! Their music is always fun, unique, and creative, and this is no exception!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I have a very noisy some ace heater that drives me nuts. I use this at night to fall asleep and during the day to study.  Cheaper than replacing my heater, and better for keeping focus.
B004FP1WX0|4.0|This movie was a good reminder to watch my step when I'm online. People are crazy if you haven't heard.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I realized the book is not for me, I felt I was wasting my precious time reading this book<br />My time is more valuable to be spent like this
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Love it. Works well with Google 7 nexus, just cannot down load games. It would be perfect it you could download games as well as books.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I decided to get this app to learn why everyone kept talking about it. It's simple - it's fun and a bit of a mind bender. Just challenging enough to keep you occupied while you laugh at the set-ups. Good time.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Just finished the Kindle edition of Andy Weir's roller-coaster-ride novel &#34;The Martian,&#34; and I'm smiling like the kid I used to be, growing up reading early Heinlein books (Red Planet), then the Asimov adventures (A Fall of Moondust), and then on to Clarke (Rendezvous with Rama)!  Mr. Weir has created a fantastic adventure, full of casually referenced hard science, MacGyver-esque life-or-death problem solving, and a cinematic ending that had even me emotional.  It's that Damn Good, really, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to rediscover that excitement of a really well-conceived and brilliantly written science fiction novel, or to those who really wish to read a gritty-witty, tense, and thrilling adventure, that reals out better than some of the last few big- budget movies.  Thank you, Andy Weir, for &#34;The Martian,&#34; and I look forward to your next novel!  Cheers!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is solitaire, but this version provides several dealing selections and the random deals are challenging without being impossible. Very enjoyable.
B004Y042N8|4.0|I got this awhile back as a free app of the day not expecting much .boy was I wrong my 7 year old niece took to this game and loves it .Some puzzles are more difficult than others .It's a quick play with some thinking.

B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft would be so much better if you could mine redstone and there was enderman. Also if there could be buckets to scoop water and lava but there is no lava so could you please put those things in the next update? Otherwise good job on the game.
0062238868|1.0|The main problem with this book is that the author believes in an alternate reality which makes the entire story seem sad and pointless.  The author thinks 9/11 had something to do with Iraq, and that he's somehow getting revenge for 9/11 by attacking Iraq (even though he's helps seize an oil well).  Obviously he's clueless and believed propaganda from the U.S. government, but honestly a lot of U.S. citizens fell for the lies from the federal government. (this is not Republican bashing, Democrats are doing the same things now)  What makes his story even more concerning is that he's there in the thick of it with our government seizing oil wells and turning them over to oil contractors that cozied up to our politicians yet still, the author has no clue what is actually going on.  He still believes he's fighting for our freedom or our country.<br /><br />The entire book goes on like this with Chris Kyle calling Iraqi's savages and evil for wanting to defend themselves and keep our government from installing a puppet government in Iraq (although Chris is too foolish to realize this is what we're doing).  He claims these \\"evil savages\\" have taken so much from him, but I'm at a loss as to what that is.  The U.S. government took a lot from Chris Kyle though.  They violated the Constitution, they pointed a gun at Chris's head and told him to violate the Constitution, and they violated the contract Chris signed when he joined the Navy.  Chris however doesn't have the mental aptitude to see this, and that's what makes this book so hard to read.  The entire time I read it I keep asking why Chris, why don't you ask why it is you're attacking a foreign country and calling them evil when you're the one killing their fathers and sons?  Why Chris don't you realize this creates more hatred against the U.S. when we are the world tyrant?<br /><br />Chris Kyle makes a great soldier though because he's tough, well trained, and very very unthinking.  He never questions why he's killing all these people.  He blindly believes the Bush quote \\"we have to kill them over there to keep them from attacking us at home\\", which every dictator, emperor, and even Hitler have said to justify mass murder and confiscation of resources and property.<br /><br />Some of the 1 star comments on here are really harsh against Chris but keep in mind all of our soldiers have been put in a bad position.  They signed up to defend our country and the Constitution and instead were asked to violate their oath and murder innocent people for corporate war profiteering.  What can a soldier in that situation do other than defect and get the heck out of the country?  That's a tough decision to make even for our service men and women that do understand the reality of the situation. (I mean can you really expect them to get an attorney and prosecute the government for violating the Constitution?  The government violates the Constitution everyday and no one can stop them)  Many in the military have realized this and just because Chris didn't have the intelligence to realize this does not mean he's a bad person, it just means he's been duped, used, and abused for someone else's political and financial gain.  That's what makes his story so sad.
B004YXE438|5.0|Love puzzles and this is a great game, you decide how big or small the pieces are and the level of difficulty.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|If u like Tina fey u will love her book. I'm 29 so I didn't get some of her references to some ppl, shows, etc from her youth bc she's older than me but nonetheless I laughed out loud on many occasions
B004QK5N5W|5.0|I was skeptical about the HD, but it does produce a high def, high quality picture on our 46\\" LCD TV.  It doesn't widen to entire width of TV without messing with the settings on the TV, but that's to be expected.  If you want to show something from your iPad it's a good, low cost  option.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is very enticing and addictive. I enjoy collecting the coins and when the game gets faster and faster,it is really exiting. The only thing is, is that when you get caught, you have to go right back to the beginning of the run, so maybe, there could be checkpoints, but that's the only thing that I have to say about it being bad.
B00127RAJY|3.0|Jillian does a nice job coaching you through this video, and it's definitely true that you can do all her moves in your living room. I've been using this after shorter runs, when my calorie burning ability should technically be at it's highest. I'm still pretty doubtful that I would be shredded in 30 days. In fact, it's been 90. I'm in good shape, but I'm pretty sure doing this video alone would not do the trick.<br /><br />The workouts have good variation and are challenging enough, in my opinion. I like that it's not dependent on lifting heavy weights, but rather on reps. It feels like a real workout, even though it is short. But like I said, I've been doing it on top of a pretty serious running schedule, and I find her &#34;cardio&#34; annoying. I would like this video a lot better if she tossed the cardio and added the extra time to abs.<br /><br />In short, this is good as workout videos go. I really like Jillian's style and will probably purchase more of her workouts. In fact, I'm surprised to hear her referred to as &#34;tough&#34;. She seems pretty approachable and encouraging to me.
B006N57PXG|4.0|The amulet of samarkand is an amazing novel by Jonathan Stroud. Fantasy invades each of the chapters. I really enjoy it.
142311339X|5.0|Oh, Rick Riordan, you are a God yourself. Or at least a demigod! Your books are amazing, they suck me in so quickly I have to save them for long weekends, and I really wish I was a demigod (without the monsters of course). I am not sure which God or Goddess I'd like to belong to, but I know I wouldn't want to belong to Hades- what a creeper! My only complaint? Why in all of Mount Olympus can't you save all your books in a series and release them together?! I really can't wait a whole year for the next book!<br /><br />After the amazing conclusion of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, Riordan has created another little gem, The Heroes of Olympus. The first book in the series, Lost Heroes, doesn't disappoint. It is full of Greek myths, some Roman mythology for good measure, sprinkled with some familiar characters like Annabeth, Chiron and our favorite Gods and Goddesses (in all their ridiculous glory). While Percy Jackson may not be present, his mysterious disappearance is still in the background as some of the heroes go off to find him. The focus of the story, though, is three demigods who are thrown together in a Hail Mary attempt to save the Gods from the new threat brewing. Percy may have finished off the Titans in the first series, but he really ticked of their mother, the Earth mother Gaia herself, and she can be one mean old lady.<br /><br />Now Jason, Piper, and Leo, all demigods with special circumstances and powers, must go on a quest to find Piper's kidnapped father, find out why Jason's memory has been wiped, and stop whatever is threatening the Gods. Unfortunately, there are plenty of saucy or wicked Gods and spirits out their to derail their quest. Can they find the kidnapped Goddess in time to save her and stop Gaia from awaking? Should they trust each other? What the heck is up with creepy mud giants?!<br /><br />This was an amazing first installment to this new series. I loved having a new series with new main characters, but familiar ties to places like Camp Halfblood and characters from the first series made it seem like an extension of the first series- it was the best of both worlds!! Since the Percy Jackson books are not terribly long, if a student made it through the five books in that series, this would be the next graduated step. Topping out at over 550 pages, it is like two Percy Jackson books in one, but the mutual characters and setting along with fun new themes and quests make it an exciting new adventure. The writing style and skill level is the same as the first series, relatively accessible for a middle school student through high school (especially for low-skilled high school students because it is still fun and exciting- not at all juvenile). Give Jason, Piper, and Leo a chance- you won't be sorry!places like Camp Halfblood and characters from the first series made it seem like an extension of the first series- it was the best of both worlds!!

0385738757|5.0|At times a sequel can far surpass the original book. It isn't easy, and rarely does it involve a huge plot shift. In The Scorch Trials, by James Dasher, the sequel to The Maze Runner, the story takes twists and turns that will leave the reader's head spinning. While the first book had the group of boys (Gladers) surviving the terrifying maze that turned out to be a test for scientists to help save the damaged world, this second book takes that horrifying idea even further.<br /><br />The story begins just after the Gladers were saved from the Maze. They were ushered into a building under the cloak of darkness, fed, and left to sleep away their terrors. When they wake up, the people who brought them there are all dead, hanging in the common room. Thomas goes looking for Teresa, the only girl ever sent to the Glade and the girl he can speak to telepathically, but finds a strange boy in her room and no sign of Teresa. They find out from this boy quickly that there was another Maze- an all girls' maze that ended with Aris arriving as the only boy the same way Teresa arrived in the boys' maze. Stuck in the compound with no way out and bars on the windows (which keeps out the crazy Cranks- people driven to murderous madness by a disease called Flare), the boys spend days starving and wondering if they had been left to die.<br /><br />Finally, when they are on the brink of starvation induced madness, a Rat-faced man arrives to tell them they are about to begin the next phase of their trials- the Scorch Trials. They will have to exit the compound and make it across the solar-flare ravaged desert, which is teeming with Cranks, in order to get to the safe house where they will be cured of the Flare. If they don't make it to the safe house, they will die by slipping into insanity like so many millions of other people have. The catch? The Scorch trials will make the Maze look paradise.<br /><br />The Gladers choose to make a run for it, but even the entrance out of the compound and out into the world isn't safe. A weird metallic substance drips from the ceiling and hardens around the heads of the unfortunate, ultimately decapitating them. Once they reach the outside, the sun is so severe it threatens to give third degree burns with only a couple of hours of exposure. After quickly making meager protective shields for the sun, they escape the tunnel and set out across the Scorch. Unfortunately, everything from frighteningly intense electrical storms to cannibalistic Cranks are between them and the cure for their Flare. With the help of a couple of Cranks who aren't too affected by the disease yet, the Gladers who have lasted this far finally have a chance of making it to the safe haven. The last part of the trial, though, may involve more than they had bargained for- especially when they encounter the group of girls from the other maze.<br /><br />This is a crazy second installment. When you think you have finally figured out the formula for the story, Dashner slaps you in the face with a totally new twist. The characters are put through so much, you can hardly believe any kid could survive long enough to make it to the other side of the trial. The violence is more graphic, the scenarios are more frightening, and the warped government reaches new levels of post-apocalyptic madness. This is a good series for that kid who needs constant action and twists to keep their attention. I think this book is a little like The Maze Runner's juvenile delinquent older brother. It will keep even the most easily distracted reader's attention from cover to cover.and out into the world isn't safe.

The characters are put through so much, you can hardly believe any kid could survive long enough to make it to the other side of the trial. The violence is more graphic, the scenarios are more frightening, and the warped government reaches new levels of post-apocalyptic madness. This is a good series for that kid who needs constant action and twists to keep their attention. I think this book is a little like The Maze Runner's juvenile delinquent older brother. It will keep even the most easily distracted reader's attention from cover to cover.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|A very good story, and a fast read. I totally enjoyed it. A page turner. A very good look at the pilots involved in the war.
B009D7CP2M|5.0|Interesting book that addresses in a very thoughtful way, the origins of violence in our youth.  I liked it, even though it paints some very disturbing pictures.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|At last, a television show for those who like to think occasionally! The plots are well written, and the acting is superb!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I started playing it one night and I got so absorbed I didn't realize that it was already midnight. Very imaginative, well constructed game.
B003TRKQNW|5.0|Cherubini always held a strong fascination for me because his Credo canon for two four voice choirs in contrary motion is quoted in so many counterpoint books.  Eventually I tracked down a copy of Cherubini's own treatise on counterpoint.  Oddly enough the 150 year old book was just as beautiful as its contents.  I read in a few books on counterpoint that Cherubini's treatise on counterpoint is unusual because it is written by a man who was both a great composer and a great teacher.  So when I saw this set of music on Amazon, I couldn't resist.  It is certainly a bargain with 7 CD's.  I've only listened to the first two masses (two CD's) so far, but if I wait till I've listened to everything I will probably forget to write a review.  The first two masses didn't appeal to me on first hearing, but before moving on I decided to give them a few hearings, and by the second or third I was hooked.  He writes beautiful music, and when he chooses to, he writes superb counterpoint.  Since so many of the greatest composers wrote masses, I will always be grateful that I grew up singing the Latin mass, and I know all the texts by heart.  Cherubini reminds me of what someone said about Josquin, &#34;Other composers serve the notes, but he is their master.&#34;
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show is perfect for me....I've had a very stressful year and this provides me an escape to a world that is so far removed from my life! To get a glimpse into the highly privileged and disgustingly rich lifestyles of these people, provides a nice escape from my ordinary middle class life with REAL problems. LOVE IT!
B00BF123WG|3.0|Was not enough to keep me awake. sorry.  I was so excited to watch it and then....poof.........I was disappointed.  Maybe I'll watch it again and see what I missed.
B00BJA2VFW|3.0|This is a colorful game and certainly one a ten year old might enjoy. The action is simple and should keep attentions riveted for awhile.
B0030CMK8A|5.0|Find I recommend the first book which was recommended to me when pregnant with my twins, they both started sleeping thru the night at two months. So I thought it would be good to see what she had to say about toddlers and us as the boys toddle around the house. And it was. If you let her she helps you become more mindful, more zen.<br />I don't want to read too many opinions. Luckily I was recommended hers and so I don't waste time with others.
B000QUCNXG|5.0|His name means change. He, like most people does not want to change. But he does, dramatically, if not reluctantly. He lets go of Erica, his love. He gives up his high paying corporate job in which his focus on the minutiae provides his life meaning. He sacrifices the approval, understanding and encouragement of Jim, his father figure boss. He trades his American lifestyle and the ability to monetarily help his Pakistani family for life in Lahore as a university lecturer exposing the flaws of American foreign policy to his students. The format of the story, Changez relating his life's tale in the first person to an American visitor, for me sometimes became tedious but at the completion I understood it to be a brilliant tactic and a major part of the change in the way I view American/Pakistani relations.<br /><br />I did find it disturbing that there were many errors in spelling in this English translation, perhaps another sign of my need to change mindless beliefs.
1439153663|5.0|It seems many are talking about this book these days and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Great characters.  Lots of twists and turns.  Very good 'book club' book.
B005ZCXPP0|2.0|I was not at all impressed by this movie.  It felt very cheesy and frankly boring.  Not even close to the quality that Avengers had.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Well, there will be nothing to compare to the original Bond movies with Sean as Bond, but than again each generation has its beginning point for memories.  I thought this Bond movie was better than the last six Bond movies.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|The series is awesome, so hard to put the book down... and the movies are almost as good  as the books
B0067TGSOK|4.0|Some seem unrealistic ( graphic designer to full time map maker overnight)  but it goes to show that life does change with a blink of an eye.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|If you're not sqeamish, enjoy forensics details and like a strong female lead in a criminal mystery story, you'll probably enjoy this series, similar to Patricia Cornwell's books without the depression.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Downton Abbey is great.  Was a gift for my mom...and both she and my dad got hooked on the show too.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|This works great when you have a lot of older film negatives or slides; I still have some of those in the box.  It is a small device but it has a lot of things it can do.  Other than it can digitize your films, it can also play a basic slideshow directly to your TV via the included RCA cable.  Of course it already has a small built-in tilting color screen to see what is on your films and negatives, but if you have bad eyes or want to see a closer look it is good to know that you can plug it to your big screen. One odd thing I noticed, while you are just scanning or previewing what's on the films, it looks pixelated on the TV, but once you captured and saved them, they will look great on playback.  It is also nice that it can automatically sense if it is a negative or a color slide.<br /><br />The film scanner has an internal memory but it can only keep a few pictures.  You will have to supply you own SD card.  There are two settings for resolution, either 5 or 10 megapixels,  I use the later.  Once you get them in the SD card, you can just insert it in the slot of your PC for additional processing.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- you will need to read the manual to learn how to navigate to the different settings and functions.  Don't lose the manual or at least take pictures of them so you can refer back to it when needed.<br /><br />Sample item provided by the distributor for evaluation review.

B004I744AS|5.0|This product provides me with complete, comprehensive and understandable definitions - quickly.  I use it a lot and recommend it highly.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|All Hail Tarantino!  Brad Pitt does well, but Christof Waltz steals the show.  Be prepared for bullets and gore, but that is secondary to everything else.
B005LAIHE0|5.0|A special movie for us.  Saw the set location at the vineyard in Glen Ellen and booked our tripple witching week (Valentines, birthday,38th anniversary) at Beltane Rancn B&B.  (Mislabled BeltRane Ranch in the credits)  Made the movie that much more enjoying.  It's a working ranch and winery.  Great Sauvigon Blanc.
1400067820|3.0|Nassim Taleb is clearly brilliant, erudite, philosopher, scholar and a very real and practical person. If he could only get beyond himself... I found the book to be brilliantly insightful with example after example of how randomness improves the \\"system\\" (business, economy, species, etc.) and how trying to smooth-en randomness creates undesirable side-effects. His arguments are compelling, comprehensive and brilliant in their insight.<br /><br />If only Nassim could get past his own petty grudges... but he clearly can't. Unfortunately we have to read a lot about his personal issues with editors, educators, his exercise schedule and his disdain for economists and so on. Dude! You are brilliant and persuasive but you choose to present yourself as petty and small minded. If Nassim could just let his ego step back a little, this could be an awesome book. Unfortunately at present this is a bloated combination of a great insight and misfortunate catalogue of personal issues.
B008I34ZFW|2.0|is ok the movie is not to great dont waste your money for this movie... the movie is so stupid do not buy this one
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hello, my name is Mimi and I'm a Wool-o-holic...and there's no recovery in sight!<br /><br />I am so glad I have been able to read these five stories as an Omnibus Edition...it would have been a nail biting experience to have to wait for each installment! This is one of the best post-apocalyptic tales I've ever read, and what makes it even more incredible is that it started as a novelette and the demand for more did not come from the big publishers but instead from Amazon readers. Now a long-time resident of the Amazon Top 100, a #1 Bestseller in Science Fiction on Amazon, and a potential film optioned by Ridley Scott and Steve Zaillian, this is a true self-publishing success story!<br /><br />So why is this one of the best post-apocalyptic stories I've read, right up there next to The Stand and The Hunger Games? Well, in addition to the fast-paced, addictive writing style with just enough description to paint a vivid picture of the setting and action without being overly-descriptive, this premise itself definitely seems plausible. Something happened that sent humanity into these subterranean silos, stored away like seeds for better times. These stories deal with what happens to these \\"seeds\\" when stored away too long. Outstanding!<br /><br />As I finished each of the stories (which really tied the entire plot together very well), I reviewed each installment. Here are the individual reviews:<br /><br />Wool (Wool #1) -<br /><br />I'm currently reading the Wool Omnibus Edition, which includes Wool #s 1-5 and I will do an overall review of the entire edition, but in the meantime, a few comments about Book #1.<br /><br />My husband discovered this series and highly recommended it to me, knowing how much I love science fiction/dystopian literature like \\"The Hunger Games\\", \\"The Stand\\", etc. So I sat down to read Book One and couldn't put it down.<br /><br />So it looks like mankind has done it again...things have just gotten so bad outside that everyone is stuck living in a giant underground silo, where reproduction is determined by lottery and \\"criminals\\" and \\"rule breakers\\" are sent outside to clean the silo's lens, which is the only link to the apparently toxic world beyond.<br /><br />When you read this story, keep in mind this is only the beginning. We are introduced to Sheriff Holston, who lost his wife to the cleaning as a result of her curiosity and now he finds himself desiring similar answers. His actions here seem to be the beginning of a string of events that I am look forward to seeing unfold. I am now in the midst of Book 2...more on that later... ;)<br /><br />Proper Gauge (Wool #2) -<br /><br />Continuing my way through the Wool Omnibus Edition, so some comments on Wool, #2...<br /><br />After Sheriff Holston was sent to clean, Mayor Jahns needed a new Sheriff. So she and Deputy Marnes set off on a \\"journey\\" through the descending levels of the Silo via the staircase that links it all together, thus also giving the reader a tour of the different levels. Since her first choice is a woman who unknowingly threatens both the political aspirations of others and the secrets of the Silo as a whole ,this segment of the Wool pentalogy deals powerfully with the political and social order existing in this seemingly dystopian society.<br /><br />The mood of the writing here is, in a word, claustrophobic...and I imagine that this is the exact feeling the author is trying to convey. Imagine living in a place where you can only travel up and down on a rickety old staircase, surrounded by silo walls, and the only way to see the light of what appears to be the outside world is by taking the arduous journey up that staircase? The ironic thing here which shows us the truly \\"upside-down\\" nature of this world,is that getting closer to the \\"light\\" of the outside world has not, so far, been a positive sign; we have seen this both in Holston's cleaning experience and in Mayor Jahn's ascent back to the top.<br /><br />This is also the installment where we begin to see the author's brilliant Wool metaphor being developed, starting with the name of the Book, \\"Proper Gauge\\", and the knitting symbolism throughout.<br /><br />\\"After much deliberation, Mayor Jahns selected a pair of needles. She always chose carefully, for proper gauge was critical. Too small a needle and the knitting would prove difficult, the resulting sweater too tight and constricting. Too large a needle on the other hand, and it would create a garment full of large holes. The knitting would remain loose. One would be able to see straight through it...\\"<br /><br />Being a knitter myself probably adds to my appreciation of this metaphor, but I still think its very creative and makes sense.<br /><br />When I finished this one, I continued on to Wool, 3 immediately.<br /><br />Casting Off (Wool #3)-<br /><br />\\"Houston? We have a problem...\\" This is what I was thinking as I read the final sentence of this installment. ;)<br /><br />So now we have Juliette thrust into the role of Sheriff while the corrupt take charge and horrible things happen to people she cares about. This one gripped me so much that I stayed up until 1:30am finishing it. I just had to find out what secrets Jules would uncover and what her ultimate fate would be (...trying hard not to give spoilers here).<br /><br />Now that we have a mental picture of the world of the Silo, \\"Casting Off\\" really moves the story along, setting up the scene for the upcoming action.<br /><br />The Unraveling (Wool #4)-<br /><br />The plot definitely thickens in this one as Juliette's refusal to clean and subsequent disappearance breeds dissent and uprising in the Silo. This continues to be one of the most addictive book I've read in a long time. A full review of the Omnibus to come after I finish Book 5.<br /><br />The Stranded (Wool #5)-<br /><br />Awesome conclusion! I was really able to visualize the action in Silo 17 and Silo 18, as we flipped back in forth between the two. The action was well developed and left me both satisfied and wondering about the fate of these two Silos...with special curiosity about what the heck is going over in Silo 40! ;)
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|This movie twists and turns it messages everywhere... from the family at the dinner table (eating different diets) to a boy trying different religions to a man/boy and tiger together (and the vegetarian boy securing meat for his boat companion)  to the stories of what happened and you choose 'the one you prefer' ... LOVE IT!!!! And so it DOES go with God
B00114RKT8|5.0|Good story about great Christian man using his gifts to stand up for those in need. Word word word word
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|I enjoyed this film immensely!  The scenery was fantastic.  The action was super intense. I enjoyed the teaser ending ... can't wait to see what happens next!!!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|....for those of us who know of someone who has, or have ourselves, struggled with addiction and the resulting downward spiral of lies it takes to maintain the facade.  Top 10 all time movie for me.  Great performances by all.  TWO THUMPS UP.
B00007GZR5|5.0|Good movie I think this is all true when you die.... great scenes beautiful! it makes sense if you take your life you are not going to heaven that is for sure....
B00BF11STU|5.0|This movie was awesome!  Best movie I saw in last year, including Argo(and I am a big BA fan).  Great story line, without all the political BS that people made it out to be.
B0063HC7EQ|5.0|Worth the substantial effort of grinding through the early parts to get to the pay off. Three stories intertwined into one.
B005LAII0I|5.0|I loved the movie. I enjoy anything that Julie Roberts is in. What do you want me to say besides how much I enjoyed it.!!
B009O2XY12|1.0|The game is cute, but as you get to higher levels you cannot win without &#34;buying&#34; more chances.  After a short while you also have to ante up if you want to continue playing.  Shame on TeamLava!
B009GED3HS|5.0|I'm a huge fan, and for everyone who is a fan, you will love continuing Ted's journey to The Mother!
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|This is a great game.  Like that you can choose from two different colors.  Like that ave different levels of difficulty.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very good story. This story was very personal to me. Nicholas Sparks didn't let me down. Of all his books, this is my favorite.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|got this for my 10 year old who hated her obnoxious alarm clock.  She likes this one much better.  There aren't many choices for your alarm sound, but all of them were less obnoxious than the other one.  It works great as long as she remembers to keep her kindle charged, and takes it to bed at night.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The perfect sequel to temple run, and probably the best app I have. I play lots of rounds in one sitting. I would recommend this for anyone!
1608871088|5.0|This is a very well done book that pulls together all the art concepts of the Rise of the Guardians film. You will enjoy looking at the artwork, and reading about the creative process that went into each of the characters.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|For anyone who was ever a fan of this groundbreaking show. This family that we all became part of for ten years, then this is the way to celebrate it.
0765325950|5.0|Read the book on my Kindle. Purchased the hardback to have it signed by Sanderson during the book signing at the Philadelphia main Library.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The book was great! I couldn't put it down, especially from the middle of the book to the end! The end was amazing...did not expect that! Wonderful! It's a must read!!!!!!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I'm a big fan of the show and can't wait until the next season is on DVD so I can complete my collection.
B0074D3CAQ|2.0|It was somewhat intriguing , but contrived.  He was an emotional train wreck, reminded me of Forest Gump.  What happened to the girl in the garage? Does Maureen ever spill her secret?
B00881VLCE|5.0|Very relaxing and keeps my mind as as I recover from leukemia,thanks for a great puzzle program!<br />The music is relaxing also! :-)
1400067820|3.0|As much as I am fascinated by the concept of things that gain from disorder, I freeely admit that this presentation is way over my non-Mensa status!<br /><br />Despite the intellectual challenge, the 3-page chapter summary at the beginning of the book is so captivating that I forged ahead -- cherry-picking chapters that held the most interest rather than employing my customary front-to-back approach to book reading.<br /><br />While I do not enjoy political analysis, so much of the content of this book speaks to me about the current state of our country, its leadership, and its direction.  So you will not find 'relevance' to be a problem here.<br /><br />And I do believe that personal growth comes from challenge.  So does this qualify us as \\"anitfragile?\\"  I'm not sure.  But I do know that the pronounced challenge that I faced in reading this book expanded my way of thinking about so many things taken for granted.  For this reason alone, the book is well worth the effort!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am still thoroughly enjoying this book. I have not yet finished it but I can hardly stand to put it down. I will be reading the next series afterwards, and I really hope they make a movie of this book.<br /><br />I have already recommended it to all of my friends.
B001R3YRG2|4.0|William \\"D-Fens\\" Foster (Michael Douglas) is having a bad day, a very, very bad day. Having already gone through a divorce with his wife and just recently laid off from his job in the defense industry, D-Fens finds himself stuck in a traffic jam in Los Angeles in sweltering heat and a non-functional air conditioner. Exasperated with the non-progress of the traffic, he simply abandons his car and begins a journey across Los Angeles with the goal of \\"going home.\\" Along the way, he sees reason after reason to be disgusted with the society he encounters and leaves a trail of crimes and destruction in his path. Meanwhile, Officer Prendergast (Robert Duvall), a police officer at the LAPD, is on the last day of work before a premature retirement. He copes with his own perceived spinelessness while trying to solve the crime spree in L.A.<br /><br />At its core, the D-Fens character is the story of the average man in an average world. Before the events of the movie, he was married, had a kid, and had a decent job. It was the embodiment of an average life and D-Fens thought he had it all. However, this all came crashing down. His wife divorces him. After the end of the Cold War, budget cutbacks cause him to lose his job in the defense industry. He was proud to have worked in a position designing missiles to protect his country, but ultimately becomes disgusted and enraged at the society he defended. He was a man that played by the rules his whole life. He worked hard and did not smoke or drink, but cracks under the pressure of reality and the ultimate unfairness of life.<br /><br />Michael Douglas stars as the main character in the film and gives a truly outstanding performance. The story and the dialogue, for the most part, is really good. There are some clichéd aspects, such as the cop who just so happens to be one day from retirement.<br /><br />Overall, this is an enjoyable movie with a great performance by its lead.
B002YVAT72|5.0|Does just what I needed and more.  I have a lot of lp's and this product is helping the transfer to my computer go a lot faster and smoother.
0307949486|5.0|This is my least favorite of the trilogy but sets up the story.  Writing, character development and story are all great.
B004LROUNG|3.0|This book was well written, but it was not worth the $10 I paid.  The plot was fairly predictable and not that interesting.

B003JBHQP4|4.0|excellent. well-made. inexpensive. exactly what i was looking for. the marketplace for this kind of object wasn't well served before &#34;amazon basics&#34;, which generally provides a well-made product at a reasonable price in areas that are often consumer &#34;minefields&#34;. well done, amazon.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|this is a really fun game but I just have one problem with it...whenever I buy a different character that is hard to get, later on the game deletes all of my data to were I have to go through the thing that shows you how to do it. It really pisses me off -.-
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|The show contains some of the best writing on television.  Even after all this time it still holds my interest.  I can not wait until season 9.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|This is a really great album, if you like this kind of music that is.....I like Macklemore because he is different.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I really go hooked on it and loved it! I would love for Season 3 to be available on line for free!
B004EF65QA|5.0|I have been fasinated with Bristish TV of late and found this little gem. I liked the love story component as well as the historical aspects.
B000P0J09C|5.0|my husband really liked this movie i am not into these kind of movies but he really liked it ,most men like these kind of movies
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|I did not like this movie at all. It was very disappointing, the way it was filmed was a failure and the dialog sucked…My wife is barred from selecting movies for the 2 weekends.
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|This is an all-time classic movie. Hadn't seen it in a while and needed a fix. Amazon Instant Video helped me out.
B004TI5N38|5.0|This is one of the better Baldacci books. Loved the characters and location. I grew up in WV so it was neat to read a story set there.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|This was a &#34;no brainer&#34; offer. Anyone who enjoys Sherlock Holmes, mysteries and great deals needs to try this one.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Excellent read but I was totally unsatisfied in the end. I had many ideas of how this one would turn out as I read it and while I love surprise endings this one didn't fit the bill. I kept saying, &#34;I've devoted all these hours and THIS is what you give me?&#34; Not happy!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|As &#34;all&#34; of the characters mature, the show becomes more and more enjoyable. I like how &#34;Watson's&#34; character is changing.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It is a great book and the fact that it teaches you a good lesson about judging people from the outside is even better. I did not like how short the chapters where. But besides that it is amazing
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Movie came in good condition and my husband like the special features on DVD. Who doesn't like a movie with the rock and Vin Diesel!
B00A0SLTCU|4.0|The action in this movie was good but lacks thrill to it - if you seem the old one and compare it to the new one you will see the thrill of the chase was better
B001L63JC8|4.0|I'm not the biggest prog rock fan, but as an album this is great!  I went and saw a reenactment of this recently with a friend of mine, and at the time I had never heard the album.  Well after that I went out and bought it, and my wife is now starting to get sick of it, which means it must be good!  Some great guitar sounds, solid rhythm section, and awesome vocals.  If you're not familiar with it and are into prog rock, recommended
B007N6NGYG|5.0|I just really love this game its just so much fun. totally. I cant stop playing. my dad thinks it is just challengeing enough not to be boring or to difficult. I cant wait to do the future era levels! !!!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Brought all my books I had saved from my kindle on my computer to my smart phone automatically.<br /><br />All book marks still in place. Downloaded new books with ease. Great app.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Creative & entertaining. A great story with good acting, directing & visual affects. Although, it has an interesting underlying message about god. Still i would recommend it.
B006JRIZJG|5.0|This bin does exactly what I wanted it to do. It neatly houses all 21 of my child's dolls, extra clothes and accessories, and looks cute in her room. We can pick it up and take it with us, but we rarely need to. It's heavy vinyl, definitely formed but soft enough to give, instead of tear, very brightly printed, and zips up all four sides. This makes it easy for my 8 year old to unfold it if she decides to play with the \\"doll house\\" print on the cube. She normally just plays with the lid, which has the swimming pool printed on it.<br />In a nutshell, it keeps everything together and out of her floor, and it's really cute. She loves it, and I no longer step on painful, tiny Barbie purses and shoes, therefore I love it.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|everybody in the family plays this game.  Ages from 7 to 68. It is easy to play yet holds your interest.
B00BK5D95C|4.0|I got this based on a referal from Amazon and I have to admit I like it.  I'll admit I got it on a deal at $3 and if I'd paid full price I'm not sure I would have bought it, but that said it turned out to be pretty good.  Some nice sonic landscapes are painted, and clearly it's something that a lot of work was put in to make it sound lush.  Sort of a Radiohead meets Cloud Cult is how I would describe the sound.  I'd recommend it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is just the game I have been looking for!  Great fun!  So real and easy to play . Love this game! !!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. Period. Introduced my son to Star Trek:-)<br /><br />Plot was great, not in my mind predictable at all, and they held true to the personality types of the original series.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Its really nice for every level of playing abilities . It's really cool for playing on a smartphone or tablet. .Luann A
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Jeu intéressent et très original. Je l'beaucoup aimé et je vous le recommande. Du fait qu'il est gratuit, cela renforce positivement l'opinion du jeu.
B00BQUUH7E|4.0|The game is A LOT of fun for the first few days. I took a break from it a little bit and it is THE BOMB again. A must get game to all of you sports fans out there!
B008RXYOKY|5.0|Works properly in a Macbook Pro OSx 10.8. and also I bought the firewire cable taking the risk that it wouldn't work but it does. It's great. Go ahead and buy it. Price is a bit high but the product worth it.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|I read this to my sons when they were little every night. And has to have it again now that they are grown. I loved this little story :)
B00BESJYAY|5.0|This really is a great family movie. It was extremely motivational and seemed to leave a lasting impression with my teenage daughter (not just from cute boys). This movie shows us that we can do anything we want no matter how big we are.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I have this software on my Kindle Fire and iPhone.  Use it regularly.  Word of the day feature is my favorite aspect of the software.

0312330537|5.0|This is the best bookl I have ever read. It is worth the length of pages it takes to read the book. Exciting, boundless , timeless piece of work!
B00005Y6YB|4.0|It was delivered in a timely manner and it was just as described in the ad so I was not disappointed.  For some odd reason there are no closed captions for us hearing impaired old cowboys.
0071766588|3.0|Come on! this can be the official guide to the TOEFL but this book is too big!!! I had to travel by plane to take the TOEFL test and I had to take the book out of my luggage because it was too heavy. People should be aware of it.
B0028MBKVG|3.0|I bought this book because I was fascinated with barefoot running- the promise that a more natural approach could be more fun and injury-free. I had already bought a pair of Vibram Five-Fingers and begun my own experiments with it after reading so many other free sources of information on the topic, but wanted a more comprehensive source of information.<br /><br />That's not what this book is. Maybe ten percent or less of this book is actually dedicated to the how and why of barefoot running and only the part about physiology and breathing during running (which I won't spoil and leave for the book to reveal) was information I hadn't already gathered elsewhere. No, mostly this book is a time disjointed narrative of the author's adventures into Mexico and eventually run an ultramarathon. I was sorely tempted to give the book 2/5 stars for this, but it's not badly written and 3/5 is fair for what the author actually wrote. If you want to read about the benefits of minimalist or barefoot running, look elsewhere. If you want to read a story about traveling to Mexico that borders on being unbelievable, this is a more fair description of the book.<br /><br />What I found most objectionable were the passages of text practically preaching a grain-centric or even vegan diet. At one point the author claims one can't run effectively with a belly full of protein, and having found great success with the paleo diet I find this simply laughable. Barefoot running and its benefits take a backseat to descriptions of ultramarathons spanning 50, 100 miles, and more. And while incidences of fatigue, passing out, and the dangers are presented, the sheer insanity or danger of such pursuits are often glossed over. Yes, human beings CAN run tremendous distances with little no injury along the way, but is this really something we SHOULD aspire to? Or, in my more layman way of viewing things, have you ever looked at a dedicated runner's emaciated frame and thought, \\"Yeah, that's sexy! I'd like to look more like that!\\" rather than having some muscles?<br /><br />If so, and if slightly hippie-ish (for lack of a better term) ideals appeal to you, or you just want to read a story, then this is the book for you. If you're actually looking for something more reasonable or an unconventional sports-medicine type of book as I was, look elsewhere.to look more like that!\\" rather than having some muscles?<br /><br />If so, and if slightly hippie-ish (for lack of a better term) ideals appeal to you, or you just want to read a story, then this is the book for you.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is my new favorite book. It's so much more than the world according to a dog. It's an amazing story that I hoped wouldn't end. Treat yourself to this story. It will make such an impact on you and how you look at life.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|It reminds me of Super Mario Bro. I enjoy playing this game. I only bought the free version and I enjoy it.
B008LSVLZG|5.0|(My first review was for the Raven CD, not the Get All You Deserve DVD.  My mistake.)  I'm a huge Steven Wilson fan (Porcupine Tree, Blackfield and No-Man) and own almost all of his CDs and some of his DVD's, but this was my favorite Steven Wilson DVD.  (I also own Anesthetize and Arriving Somewhere.)  Although I miss Porcupine Tree, I still enjoyed the sound quality, showmanship, lighting and photography of Get All You Deserve, in addition to the newest members of this performing band.  I loved the additional vocals.  My favorite song on the DVD is Luminol and I LOVE it.  I really enjoy watching it being performed live.  That's what sold me on that particular song.  (I also purchased the Get All You Deserve CD's).  I really need to listen to the DVD several more times to further appreciate and update my review of his other songs, especially the ones I wasn't familiar with before.<br /><br />I did have the \\"floppy sound\\" problem with the music on the DVD because I had to watch it on my Apple computer, instead of on my TV.  If you have the same problem, you MAY have to follow Steven Wilson's instructions, as indicated in R. Erazo Evangelista's review at the beginning of the reviewers' list.  That solution does work, although it took me awhile to figure out how to do it.<br /><br />Per Evengelista:  \\"Go to DVD player > Preferences > Disc setup and check \\"Disable Dolby dynamic range compression. 'I had this problem and the cool thing is that this solution was provided by Steven Wilson himself because I wrote my concern about it here'.\\"<br /><br />I still miss Porcupine Tree!

B0084IRI9G|5.0|One of the best books I have EVER read! It is a good read for anyone. The book itself was a used one but in great, almost perfect condition. I have suggested this book to many of my friends and family and I am going to share this with many people. A great gift for dog lovers, especially! :)
B004SIP9E2|5.0|Wanted this to complete my collection of all 4.  This one is one of the better ones and much better than #2.  Glad I got it.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season 2 is amazing and sets up what is to come as the characters unfold their stories.  The family becomes more in tuned with what is occurring within their Manson halls and more characters flourish.  This is my favorite Season and you will not be disappointed!
B00BEZTMQ8|1.0|Don't order this if you expect the digital copy to be compatible with iTunes (as they usually are, or at least have been).  This DVD only comes with Ultraviolet, meaning that you can't watch it on an Apple TV, but only through Flixter or Vudu; and you can't download a digital file to be managed by iTunes.  1 star for the bait-and-switch.  (I'd give the movie itself 4/5: it's  a must see if you are a Tolkien fan, of course, but parts were a little too cartoony for my taste.)
B0063IH60K|3.0|The constant advertisements between games is absolutely annoying!  It might be worth paying for the game if it meant no more ads.

B00BMVTTJ4|1.0|The film was far too cheesy. It was predictable, very slow at times, lacked great music, had little to no character development, and a terrible story line.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Time travel movies always leave you wondering..but I must say in this movie that is not the case.<br />I must say that I am fan of Bruce Willis movies and this move is not exception to his shoot up and kill everything in site move,<br />but the added twist of going back in time and meeting with yourself really adds an extra layer of excitement to the whole<br />move.  If you want to be moved and at the same time excited, watch this movie.
B005EI86JU|5.0|Excellent guide to a complex camera system. I'll be referring back to it frequently. Well presented and easy to follow.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's really addicting. The games fun, but it's a pain to get energy. The tasks they ask you to complete are kinda difficult as well. But the other activities you can play make up for it.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This is a very interesting read. It provides insights into the story of Steve Jobs and those around him with great narratives.

B001AT4Y84|5.0|I remember when I first watch this movie and some parts of what they said just did not make any sense.  After the director put the move back to it original form as he wanted, it all makes sense now.  Some parts that were cut out just to save time, were really key in making sense of later part of the movie.  If you really want to see how the move should have been, this is the best I have seen for terminator.  I hope they have more directors cut for the other terminator movie so we can see what it was meant to be in the first place.
B004A8ZX28|4.0|This is the familiar story of the guy who gets into an  accident and then......Well, there are many variations on that theme. In this one , he is involved in a serious auto accident but after being in  a coma for four days, he is weak, memory blurred, but apparently clear-minded enough. Naturally, his first thought is of his wife, his second, is about the Conference he is in Berlin to attend.  He must get to her to resolve her natural anxieties; he must get to the Conference to take his place among the speakers. Despite warnings from the physician in charge of his case, he sets out for the hotel in which he and his wife are to be registered. On arriving there, he finds.........................many problems. The  remainder of the picture is devoted to solving these problems....or, doing his best to do so.
B007KOMTUI|4.0|Sordid but interesting.  Pete is a scum bag.  So is Roger but Pete takes the cake.  Also, Peggy finally shows some backbone.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I didn't go see this film in a theater, because I dreaded what Hollywood, and particularly Disney, would do to a beloved favorite book. Later, the DVD became available at a reasonable price so, with some trepidation, I ordered it. Imagine my joy and satisfaction at what a massive labor of love this movie turned out to be. I'm no big fan of CGI effects, but as I watched this miraculous film, I realized that it couldn't have been done until now. Incredible affects aside, the screenwriters gave enough attention to character development to make you actually care for the principles involved. I think in time, despite the apparent lack of financial success this movie has had, it will gain a following and become a beloved treasure like another superb Disney effort that comes to mind, The Rocketeer.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I know that a lot of people will complain about the cast and  their voices and such but I don't care I loved this movie.
B008JFUNAU|1.0|OZ: THE GREAT AND POWERFUL is perhaps one of the most confused and hopelessly lost films I've seen in a while.<br /><br />I'm not sure who this movie was made for, or what brand of nostaliga they were aiming for, or what answer they were trying to provide about the origin of the Wizard of Oz - because it seems the film is more interested not in honoring or expanding the Baum books, but instead bent on insult.  The film is insulting to everyone and I mean literally everyone - first, it's insulting to men.  James Franco's OZ is right out of MAXIUM magazine model - he's unshaved in a scruffy way, conflicted about work, girls and money, he looks stoned the entire time and anything outside his direct line of sight is non-existant and yet he clearly has talent - all of which he wastes on trying to get women; and how does he do this? - he lies, he lies all the time (and he never stops, even when people know the truth).  This is a major theme in the movie - the conquest or corruption of women.  I never thought I would have to battle obvious gender and sexual politics in OZ, but it seems Rami is game for this battle.  Oz here is a rouge, but in all the worst ways - LOOKING FOR MR. GOODBAR (1977) worst ways if you've seen the film - he's sleezy, cheap and another man-child who thinks he will never grow old and never die.  His trip into OZ is at first to escape responsibility and, of course, ends up having to take responsibility and save OZ from...well, women.<br /><br />OZ is ruled by three woman - Glinda (Micehlle Williams), the true heir to the throne and two sisters, Theodora (Mila Kunis) and Evanora (Rachel Weissz); Oz first meets Theodora (in black leather pants) and their meeting is a confused, but quick mess of plot and peril that throws them together - of course Oz hits on her, lies and asks her to dance (dance = sex in this film, this is not something hidden, it's pretty much pointing right to it); being have been asked to dance before (ie: virgin) Theodora falls in love with Oz right there and then - oh, and there is a long standing prophecy about a man coming to OZ named Oz who will save OZ which Oz quickly lies about to get into Theodora's foxtrot - so, they go to the most boring Emerald City ever seen on the screen (it's like leftover code of from THE MATRIX; I fully expected Neo to come flying around the corner at any moment) and we meet Evanora who is pretty clearly evil - her take on Oz is the exact opposite of her sister's - so we have a love / hate triangle going on.  Her focus instead is on Glinda who is in exile after the death of her father who was in fact murdered by - well, guess and just take one guess and you'll be right.  Evenora says Glinda is evil, which we know is not true - but the movie goes to pains to make her first appearance on screen scream Voldemort to everyone in the back row; her power is wand based and without it Glinda is powerless...so, count on Glinda doing stupid things with her wand all the time - putting it down and walking away from it for one is the most stupid and least understood in the film (why does she do it before entering a graveyard - is there a rule I'm missing?); before Oz meets Glinda he has picked up a few friends - a flying bellhop monkey and a little girl made out of china.<br /><br />And, I have to admit - the China Girl scene is perhaps the single best moment of the film, it's a call back to the opening of the film and is surprising in both how touching it is, how complex it is and how devestating it is as well - it's here a grand, odd and disturbing theme is layered into the film about genocide - because clearly all of the girl's family, friends, entire world is destroyed by the Flying Monkeys  and nothing can bring them back (and nothing does); it's simply almost emotional overload so the film quickly does away with it until nearly the end - which manages to insult the moment even more.  Oz continues his lackluster journey until they finally meet Glinda who is pretty weakoverall - she's not stupid, but, like the rest of the women in the film the undertow is that without a man around all women are lost.  Because until Oz arrives, these three women haven't been doing much but making snide remarks, throwing curses and plotting...that's it.  But now there is a man in the mix - well, the fur and sparks fly.  Evenora uses Oz against her sister by saying he's a letch (and he is, which makes it all the more true) and Theodora is so distraught she ends up turning into the Wicked Witch of the West - in short, a man rejects her and she chooses evil; she can't be independent, she can't go on the rebound, she can't get over him - no, because the story is locked into having a Wicked Witch we have to have her go man-crazy and lose her mind over the first guy she ever waltzed with...boring.<br /><br />What happens next is your typical rise to rebellion - and this is supposed to be about freedom, as all rebellions are...but the ending is anything but, which is very odd - more in a moment; so, Glinda and Oz form their plan and they raise the troops and Oz makes ready with his most amazing trick yet (after a long, loving speech about Thomas Edison and his many wonderful inventions...some of them that seem to have clearly crossed into Oz as well - such as the light bulb; please, count the lamps in the movie) and they all go off into battle and they win!; kind of...yes, sort of...sure...it's a win, let's just call it that.  Oz fakes his death and rises from the ashes a ghostly head and scares off the Wicked Witch while Glinda has to defeat Count Dooku and his Sith powers...I'm sorry, Evenora and her green lighting powers (Sith powers) in a useless, in your face, you paid extra for it so here it goes 3D battle between the women as they fight.  It's pointless and comes off the heels of public torture and more unwanted, dark images that don't fit in this movie.  At the end, the girls all get what's coming to them, being women they should have known better than to go up against any man and Oz installs a shadow government over OZ and rules the land with fear and magic - true story; their rebellion merely sets up a secret cabal that lies to their people now.<br /><br />There's more to this film than above and you will have to make your own judgments, but I do want to comment on something in the film that you can't help but notice as Rami pushes it in your face over and over and over again (I can image it is actually worse in 3D) and that's this - OZ is now integrated; racially, socially, culturally, the works - OZ is now fully colored not only with CGI but African-American's, Asians, etc; the film is so inclusive of all people that it actually comes across as racist and I say this because the parts handed to the African-American cast are so poorly fleshed out, written and 2D as to be token - that's it, I've said it - these parts were doled out like Pez to ward off backlash of an all-white cast and all white OZ and try to prove that the film is up to date and new...it's awful, it's cheap and it's clearly framed to express this.  I felt like I was watching less a movie about OZ but more an escape from the IT'S A SMALL WORLD RIDE at Disney.<br /><br />OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL fails on so many levels - it's simply an insult to everyone, even when it tries to do good, tries to make us connect with OZ, it's so disconnected that we never get the chance to be there - to truly, fully belong, even though it's a world now (there is an actual globe) maybe, just maybe too much like out ours.  Click your heels quick and come back home and save yourself the trip; like a lot of tourist traps - just say you went and no one will know the difference.overall - she's not stupid, but, like the rest of the women in the film the undertow is that without a man around all women are lost.

B003TML0VO|3.0|Not sure what I was expecting, but this wasn't it.  Loved Santana in my younger days though --- guess I was expecting to hear what I use to hear then.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett has been able to merge fact and fiction very well and the story telling is very good. The audible and kindle synch is great !!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I never thought I would like this series so much, but I became very emotionally invested in it and ended up bawling my eyes out on occasion which was shocking to me, but really the show is excellent, I would say it's right up there with Game of Thrones in terms of my favorite shows ever. Definitely a must watch!
B0002TKFRM|5.0|This disc is one of the best examples of the quality of performance achieved by Reiner and the CSO. It always sounded pretty good but in the new remastered form it sounds as spectacular as the interpretations and performances. The recordings were made in 1957 and 1959 and do not betray their age to any significant extent.<br /><br />The Mussorgsky Pictures receive a performance of vividness appropriate to the subject matter. This has long been a favourite interpretation for me and has withstood comparison from many other fine interpretations and performances from the likes of Szell/Cleveland through to Gergiev/VPO with many in between. What makes this disc far more enticing than any other that I am aware of are the six additional Russian items all of which receive performances of total brilliance coupled with style and panache.<br /><br />The Night on the Bare (Bald) Mountain is the most exciting performance I have ever heard building to orgasmic frenzy up to the advent of dawn. The Marche Slave has swagger to match the famous Alwyn/LSO performance from the same era and conversely, the March Miniature could not be more delicate. Borodin's Polovtsian March is perfectly done and the Russlan and Lumilla overture has a brilliance to outshine even the Solti/LSO combination from the mid 60's. The Colas Breugnon is simply a joy which would defy anyone not to smile in pleasure at the melodic and rhythmical high jinks of the piece.<br /><br />I would suggest that this almost priceless collection deserves special consideration on any short-list of attractive recordings for anyone even remotely interested in the program. For those interested in upgrading to this remastered disc - they can go ahead safely and without doubts that it might be worthwhile.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I do believe if I was just starting out I would join the military because of Tom<br />Clancy's books.<br /><br />The story line always keeps you turning pages and he is very descriptive.<br /><br />The cast of characters in this series keeps changing but he keeps if together.<br /><br />I would recommend it to anyone into action books.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was a great read.  The story was touching and very good.  I haven't seen the movie yet but I can assure you that the book is excellent.
B008EKOO46|3.0|This is a reasonably good book, but it reads as a synopsis of Diamond's career. It lacks real coherence and real take away information regarding hunter gatherer societies and what if anything we should learn from them.<br />Guns, Germs and Steel (by Diamond) is a must read for everyone interested in the origin of how the world got to its present stage. The World Until Yesterday is without the insight of the earlier book by Diamond.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|AMAZING book it keeps you on your toes! I love the storyline and the characters. I can't wait to read the next one. This is a must read.

B00447L4KA|5.0|Had to replace this movie, when the other DVD grew legs and walked away. Another cult classic, with Shakespearean  backbone, with a modern twist. I love this movie, it has a great sound track, and great characters.
1607066017|5.0|Amazing story with equally amazing art work.  A must read for any comic fan who loves sci fi or fantasy.  I hope this series stays around.

B003G93ZCM|4.0|So much to tell about it. The back cover comments said it all.  I loved the book, too.  It is interesting to note that we are now no longer going to Moon, but we are now spending our tax-money going to Mars and completely ignored the moon. Why? I thought that the moon is supposedly to be base-landing on our way to Mars? How come we don't have any photo of  Moon's far side?  Since we had never seen any photo. This signifys that it is still hush-hush project.  We are taxpayers; therfore we have the right to know.  My impression:  there are little green men living on Moon's far side and they sent their &#34;angry alligator&#34; to check on our Apollos.  Am I totally wrong?  Maybe? Maybe not?<br /><br />Moreover, I think we were told not to come back until we learn to live in peace throughout the world; and  then we will be co-exist with the little green men. It makes sense based on Crenan's last words on the Moon.<br /><br />Mr. Eugene Cernan, thank you for the adventuresome reading. I would give you five-star if you gave us far-side information and photos.  It is really great book. I loved the book.
B0081336FO|5.0|can't wait to see the next season when is it coming out. taking so long I hope the Amazon and then keeping this show available to watch
B00AG475K8|5.0|One of those movies I can watch over and over. I am happy I could add it to my collection of 80's movies!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Te book was an easy quick read and very entertaining as long as you read the trilogy in sequence....definitely recommended.
B00B3HJMLM|4.0|This is a great new album that is upbeat with catchy tunes and a honky tonk feel to it. I only gave it 4 stars because some of the music just wasn't my taste, but it's still a great album overall. I have it downloaded on my IPod and it will probably grow on me as I listen to it more and more. Great music from this new face in country music!

B00456PKG4|3.0|so far only got through half the movie, it just doesn't hold my interest at all. was pretty dissappointed after all the reviews when they first announced it and was looking forward to seeing it.
B00005NP04|5.0|Martina McBride is fantastic! This album is full of her greatest hits and there isn't a bad one in the bunch. I loved revisiting some of my<br />favorite songs of hers and she sings like an angel. I would recommend this album to anyone in any music category.
0385493622|5.0|Incredibly readable historical and dramatic story of the quest to solve a seemingly simple version of the Pythagorean Theorem. Without going too deeply into actual mathematical equations the author tells the story of the many mathematicians who worked all their lives to provide a complete proof, yet in the end they all had to be satisfied with only partial and minute successes. The focus then shifts to Princeton's Andrew Wiles and his ultimately successful endeavor in providing a proof satisfactory to the entire international mathematical community. Incredible story-telling where some of the \\"characters\\" are mathematical concepts themselves! Beautifully done, a treasure of a mathematical story.
0765325950|5.0|Fitting ending to an amazing series!  Thank you Robert Jordan for creating such an enthralling world, and thank you Brandon Sanderson for helping to see it through to completion.  I am sad to see it end...

B000JML7YC|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book even though it isn't one of Jane Austen's most popular stories. I expected it to be much more gothic but was pleasantly surprised that it was not. I'm not big on gothic stories but this book had just enough to add suspense but not so much that I didn't like it. As with all of Jane Austen's books, I loved it!

This collection is an exciting addition to my video library and makes an exceptional gift for a discerning friend.
B001E2JNA6|5.0|This is the best version of the book I have ever seen.  I have watched it over and over when I had this same movie on Video, and now that it is on blu ray, it is just as good.  Totally love the characters and the way it is so close to the book.

1449433251|4.0|If you are looking for the Complete Calvin and Hobbes, you know what you are looking for, so I won't review the content.<br /><br />The box is very nice, high quality print. The books fit very tightly, so I sometimes worry I will damage something getting them out. I find I usually just have to tip the box and let them slide out a bit first. This is a pain, but worth it for me. It would have been nice for them to have made an easier removal process.<br /><br />The books are similarly well printed. Nice thick covers and pages.They are almost too big for comfortable reading. I used a pillow on my lap so I didn't have to hold the book and that was enough for me to not worry about that any more.<br /><br />If you have the money to burn, maybe get the hardcover version, but if you want to share Calvin and Hobbes with your children and don't want to spend a fortune, this is a very nice alternative.
B0096PAA6E|3.0|The campaign for Gary Clark Jr has received a Presidential endorsement from the White House with Barack Obama describing him as \\"the future\\" and Classic Rock endowing \\"Blak and Blu\\" with 10 out of 10. The weight of this praise is enormous and separating the reality from the hyperbole is important for while Gary Clark Jr is a great prospect this album at least does not live up to the fanfare. The problem is Clark Jr's desire not to be pigeon holed as a pure blues guitarist which is to be admired, but as a result this album lacks any sense of coherence with its sheer multiplicity of styles and often weak songs. The boisterous opener \\"Ait messin around\\" is a classic example, true it contains a blistering solo from Clark Jr but it repeats the chorus ad nauseam and frankly is the sort of song that sounds much better on stage than record. In a completely different league is the Cream influenced \\"When my train pulls in\\" a vintage piece of slow thundering blues where all Clark Jr's skills are on full display not least a great vocal style and solos flying off like lighting strikes. He is venturing into an area which is already populated with premier division guitarists like Dan Auerbach and Joe Bonamassa but he holds his own in this company and this seven minutes is possibly the finest on the record, although the later funky blues of \\"Bright lights\\" is also very good. Sadly the title track doesn't match this feat. It is essentially throwaway funk and some have already noticed the resemblance to singers like Anthony Hamilton and John Legend. Equally do we really need a rerun of every Chuck Berry cliche in the book on \\"Travis County\\" which is at heart the riff from Johnny B Goode including the guitar solo! The barrel is scraped however on \\"This life\\" which is essentially sounds like a Usher B side.<br /><br />The second half of the album takes a heavier turn in most songs (with the exception of the weak doo wop of \\"Please come home\\") and is all the better for it not least the hard rock of the pulverising \\"Numb\\" where Clark spins a nasty riff over a huge backbeat. Granted Gary Clark is no Jimi Hendrix but his slowed down cover of \\"Third rock from the sun\\" combined with Albert Collins standard \\"You love me like you say\\" is very nicely cooked and has some excellent guitar shredding over its near 10 minute duration. Thankfully the album does go out with a bang with the power funk of \\"You saved me\\" with its razor guitar powering a very strong commercial pop song. And then at last we get some proper Delta ambience with the excellent \\"Next door neighbour blues\\" where the ghosts of Big Joe Williams and Son House are invoked and a stool in a Gin joint required to pay full attention.<br /><br />\\"Blak and Blu\\" therefore is an album that cries out for a producer to reign in Clark's tendency to aimlessly genre hop and pin him down to specifics. In doing so you also pray that what comes next will draw more heavily on the fact that Clark Jr is a brilliant acoustic guitarist which is bizarrely almost completely absent on this album. The irritation of the good track/bad track approach that Clark Jr takes to the album's sequencing really does wear patience. Around half the tracks on this album are pure 5 star quality but they are padded with sub standard fare. This is a shame since Clark Jr undoubtedly has a killer album up his sleeve, sadly \\"Blak and Blu\\" is not quite it.hard rock of the pulverising \\"Numb\\" where Clark spins a nasty riff over a huge backbeat.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Larsson's books keep you clinging to the book just to find how he will get out of the situation only to find more action. Too bad he died so early. The story line of this one shows how independent the characters are yet are very dependent on each other.

I thought I had the book figured out early on but boy was I wrong.<br />I do feel that Colleen Hoovers charactors were much to complicated and well spoken to be 17 and 18 year old high school students but I still had to finish the story.

0446547654|4.0|I'm a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks and have read ALL of his books. I am constantly looking forward to a new title from him. I enjoyed reading &#34;The Best of Me&#34;. There were some predictability but a lot of surprises (for me) as well. I definitely didn't want to put it down because I just had to know what was going to happen. Great read!
B0091REZMW|5.0|It is the perfect mystery game, no change needed. I love the background music and funding the hidden objects and who's Mr.X?
B004M5HUXE|4.0|This was a good read.  My boyfriend said a huge spoiler when I was still at the begining of the book, ugh!  Written accent was hard to follow at times.

I almost didn't get it cuz the overall reviews but I am sooooooo glad I got this game. definitely the best game I've gotten from Amazon app store.
B0088TG252|5.0|I just like these kind of tremendously taut thrillers, filmed, edited, and acted superbly, the scenery and movement are such you feel you are there for the whole thing !
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this story, the book and the movie. Despite the violence I love the suspense, the craziness of the timeline and the raw emotions of the characters. I couldn't wait to read the sequels.
B009I5QU8O|5.0|Bought it for one song (on the radio) - discovered the whole album is great. It's great at the gym.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|The game has a retro feel to it which I love and the game is easy enough to play. The navigation/shooting buttons are easy and work very well. Your object is to bring down the other planes which come in waves. There are three modes to play: classic, survival and multiplayer.<br /><br />In classic they start you off shooting ducks, I guess that is to get you used to the buttons without having to worry about being shot at because that was only the first wave. Then it increasingly gets harder as they add more planes throughout the waves.<br /><br />In survival mode they add many planes at a time and you have to be the last man standing. In both modes they have power ups which do different things such as speed up, slow down, make invisible, missile attack and more. These power ups are stars of different colors you will see floating around but be quick because the enemy can get to them as well. You may also see hearts around which give you extra life.<br /><br />Even if you are shot at or shoot another plane, you/they do not die after one shot. I believe it has to be at least four shots but not difficult enough to frustrate you, it will challenge however.<br /><br />I have not played multiplayer yet so I cannot say how that is but I am eager to see it. Throughout the game you unlock more airplanes and land to play with/at. I have yet to unlock a new land but they are there giving you something to work for making the game more interesting as well. Overall it is a very good game that kids will definitely enjoy but so will the parents. Music is not bad either.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Superb direction and editing, outstanding cast, sumptuous sets and costumes, ever intriguing multiple story lines, beautifully filmed, memorable characters-- all like a really good page-turner of a book you simply can't put down. Bravo Julian Fellowes and company!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I love the mixture of horror given to the normally sweet carnival. I also love the creative twist of the parent being g the one to go missing instead of the child this time. I also love the cute monkey that helps. This game has good graphics and is creative.

B0064MPXFA|5.0|We love the characters and the cases.  A good mix of legal and personal interactions.  There is  love interest, family interactions, marriage tension and cases that are very interesting and unusual.  We like using Amazon to watch TV series because we can view them as movies without commercial breaks or having to wait to see the next episode.
B009KEN87O|4.0|This is a very entertaining game with great controls. Maybe not for $2.56, but if it drops to $.99 it would be a good buy.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Good game to play about some horses that do things like running and stuff so I like to play it because I like horses.
B00598XVA4|5.0|What else can you say about this album?  INCREDIBLE!  You don't love Iron Maiden if you don't love this album.
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|Overall, this movie wasnt too bad, but it could've been better.  Without giving to much away, it was predictable and lacking in the horror section.  Not enough gore or imagery to be scary.
B004SIIBGU|2.0|Title says it all. Text is extremely small on 10&#34; tablet, almost unreadable. Very few options. Very limited use on 10&#34; tablet.

B009EEFTMC|5.0|Love this game. Fun trying to beat your own time or beat someone else's time. It is well worth the price.
B00865P3AS|5.0|I have always loved anything played by a cello. When I heard them play on YouTube, I fell in love with them and their music.  I adore the way they can go from rock to classical without missing a beat.  This second album by Sulic and Hauser has both rock and classical with Elton John on one vocal and Lang Lang on the piano in the Coldplay song Clocks.  I really enjoy their take on all these varied pieces.  I must say, I really love their music and am following them to hear all the songs they put out.  Relaxing, accomplished, perfection!

B0034DGPEU|1.0|I found this book stereotypical and predictable. it reminded me of &#34;Gone With the Wind&#34; with a few contemporary issues thrown in. The characters were stiff and two dimensional and the plot was contrived. I did not finish the book.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Can't compare to ipad version. Can't save pics easily. Screen freezes often. Hard to navigate. Text is smaller than apple version. Actually, text is tiny, almost unreadable. Menus are not the same. Runs very slowly. My ipad is acually slower pocesser but runs much smoother with large east to read text and icons. Can't save photos or pages without opening browser is time consuming and is enough reason not to use Facebook on an Android.
B00BLF9FOK|3.0|Arnold Schwarzenegger promised he'd be back and now he is following his stint as governor of California  In the Last Stand, in his first starring role in nearly a decade, but it isn't all it should be as a comeback vehicle, don't get me wrong, it's good to have the big guy back on the big screen where he belongs, but the Last Stand ends up being only a modest return and a little bit of a disappointment.<br /> As a movie, the Last Stand plays as a movie at least a two decades or more out of step with current audiences. It is a modern day western that hits all the lazy western clichés. It's actually little more than a contemporary version of Rio Bravo with Arnie as John Wayne and Johnny Knoxville as Walter Brennan, it even has a town drunk who's redeemed by standing tall alongside Schwarzenegger.<br /> The movie also couldn't have come at a worst time, with gun control as a hot bed issue. The Last Stand has enough of a pro-gun stance to please any card carrying member of the NRA. Set in an Arizona border town where everyone is packing heat and is either a redneck or a hillbilly.<br /> The Last Stand has about three story threads running through it. The first is the already mentioned neo-western starring Arnold. There is also one long continuous car chase involving an escaped fugitive, which looks like a very exciting car commercial, but a somethat boring movie. Then there is the counter point sub plot with Forrest Whitaker as a dogged FBI agent hunting said fugitive and having lots of unconving discourse, this is easily the least satisfying part of the movie.<br /> Schwarzenegger plays Ray Owen, a would-be Arizona cowboy who's actually a former L.A. narcotics officer. The role was originally written for Liam Neeson, it should have been written been written for Clint Eastwood. As long as you forget the details easily, like that name, Schwarzenegger actually does a very good job. He's as tough and strong as ever, but is more venerable that a lot of other movie tough guys, no longer a one man army or inhuman machine without feelings. He is still a strong and likable film presence, it's easy to forget just how good a movie star or even a good actor that he really is.<br /> It is an enthusiastic occasionally laughable shoot 'em up, but very much a forgettable \\"B\\" movie. Not completely unsatisfying, but not the triumphant return for Arnold Schwarzenegger. If anything it serves as a fearsome warning that a lot of these aging action stars are not only long in the tooth, but out of touch with contemporary values.<br /> The Last Stand is the English language debut of Jee-Won Kim. A South Korean director who's filmography, up to this point, has been very impressive. As  the director of the eerie horror film A Tale of Two Sisters, the brutal revenge thriller I Saw the Devil and the wonderfully giddy fun \\"teriyaki style western\\" the God, the Bad and the Weird. Jee-won gave lots of hope for this film, but he seems to be stifled by American filmmaking. I sincerely hope that this great talent does not find himself bogged down by formulaic action movies in the way that the equally fine director John Woo was.<br /> At least the Last Stand has a mostly game supporting cast including the excellent Spanish actor Eduardo Noriega as the central bad guy, but it is the wonderful Peter Stormare who is the film's main antagonist for the bulk of it's one hundred and three running time speaking with a southern fried American accent via way of Sweden. Also making a brief appearance is Harry Dean Stanton as a cantankerous shotgun wielding old codger. And as we know, no movie with Harry Dean Stanton in it can be all bad.<br /> However Johnny Knoxville serves as the unnecessary \\"comic relief\\" in a humorless role, fortunately he is not as much of a presence as his second billing would indicate. Also very much a sore spot is Luis Guzman, who was once a great character actor, but now just seems to be cast as annoying often cowardly dufases, this being no exception.<br />  Relative newcomers Jamie Alexander and Rodrigo Santoro stand out as Schwarzenegger's more serious deputies. Whitaker adds charisma in an undistinguished supporting role, but he is able to spout dialogue like \\"a psychopath in a Batmobile\\" with a straight face.<br /> Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of the great movie stars not just of the last thirty years, but of all-time and more than deserves a rightful film comeback, but this is not it. A half backed mostly uninteresting routine action flick. It's not Schwarzenegger's last stand, but if he doesn't choose his future projects more carefully he will continue to show his age in more ways than one. A modest failure in my opinion, but a failure none the less.

B008CLI3TE|5.0|I love this show so much that I bought the first and second season, as well as the entire book series. George R. R.

B006FO3ERQ|5.0|This book surrounded me with its characters and sense of place. I was sorry to have it end. the writing was excellent and the characters were three dimensional and fascinating. I read this book a month or so ago and I can still bividly recall the characters, the clothes they wore and the places they lived.
B008KYOCA2|4.0|When products does what you want and is cute and fun, what more can you ask for. My only wish is I could back it up somehow.
B008UG0JJI|5.0|I would rate Hiromi's DVD with 5 Stars.<br />If you have never witnessed Hiromi in concert;<br />this video will give you a great experience!!
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I chose this case because I loved the old book look. I received it was immediately very please with the product.<br />It fits my Kindle Fire perfect and it always looks like I am carrying an old book around!
044024367X|4.0|Nothing to Lose by Lee Child<br /><br />As embarrassing as it is to admit, I am brand new to Jack Reacher.  Hard to believe that I enjoy a genre this much and have not read anything by Lee Child.  For any others who haven't read, Reacher is the consummate, self contained, enormously talented loaner whose insatiable curiosity and stubbornness lead him into difficulties only resolved by applied violence.  This tale takes place in a remote and lonely section of Colorado and the towns of Hope and Despair.<br /><br />Jack Reacher epitomizes stubbornness and orneriness.  Jack likes to get his own way and will not hesitate to knock heads to get it.  Knowing that the stories are outrageous to begin with helps to leaven the indestructible nature of Jack.  Reacher takes lumps that are even painful to read let alone experience.<br /><br />The plot of this book was sadly plausible and thus a bit frightening.  Reacher's Old Testament solution is aptly appropriate.<br /><br />There is non-stop action and lots of violence.  I enjoyed the book and I  recommend the book.<br /><br />Web Site: [...]
B004H4XDBI|5.0|This book was so good. I actually read it in one day. Great for teens or young adults. Like myself!
B000E41MRC|3.0|The movie is fine for about the first 2/3 of the film but then defects appear. The scenes black out, stop, the movie doesn't go forward. Time passes with nothing happening and only after five minutes or more does the film start up again. I don't know if this defect was only in my copy or in all of them. In any case, be ready for unexpected problems. You would have thought the makers would have simply eliminated the parts that won't display and moved on to the rest with some sort of apology for the defects.
B008PZZV8S|3.0|Talented actors at an interesting time in their careers. The movie is very dark and disturbing. Take it or leave it.
B008UG0IS0|5.0|If you are a Hiromi fan, then you will love her new CD.<br />Just like Kung Fu Championship, there's action in each song.<br />It is definitely one of her best writings ever!!<br /><br />A Must have!!!
B009KEN87O|5.0|Not Many Games Impress Me Enough To Write A Review. This One Is A Creative Reinvention Of A Retro Style Game. Its Creative, Visually Interesting, Simple, And Actually Fun To Play.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very hard to put down. Just when I thought I had it figured out, something would change my mind completely. I could imagine this happening in real life, frightening!
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|I loved this movie hands down. great story with a great pace of telling the story and a great ending. This movie had it all.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|We often get caught up in our daily routine and forget to live. This movie is a great visual reminder of life. A heart warming story of a boy who becomes a man. The story talks about love and adventure. It serves to remind people of what is really important in life.
B00181JGI2|4.0|Generally an interesting comedy with lots of twists in the story.  The story was drawn out a little too much.
B0067Q42BY|3.0|mahjong is mahjong this one has fewer ads then the free version but no different same game it is fun if you like mahjong
1936608618|5.0|Easy reading with a lot of illustrations and examples. Good for all level triathletes, runners, bikers; swimmers, and crossfitters alike. It doesnt need to be read from cover to cover. I picked what was necessary to me and then went back to cover the rest.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Hard to put down. Lots of characters that I really was wondering what would happen to them. Amazing to think things like this actually happened...
B0090EHVMC|5.0|this was a good kids movie and a great way to show children why they should take care of the invironment and respect trees.
031603441X|5.0|If you are a Stones fan this is a must read. If you aren't its still a very worthy read. Keith Richards goes into detail about his life, overcoming drug addictions, and love of music. I recommend it to anyone.
B00AHTYGRW|2.0|Boring, bad acting etc etc. They must have paid dearly for this Oscar. I do not get how this movie won the best picture award
B007IXWKUK|5.0|book two is the best one of the three- it is more engaging but still unbelieveable- faster pace then book one that took me forever to get into
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Wasn't what I thought it would be...never finished it...but based on reviews had to give it a go.  Hope others enjoy it though.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Totally worth $6.99 this game is really fun  addicting to. Hope the next update comes soon. :) again really cool
B00BSBY38A|5.0|LIFE OF PI..............beautiful cinematography  Lee certainly deserved the Oscar. My favorite actor was the Tiger.<br />I enjoyed reading the book, too0.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|fun game and be careful because. time flies by!  food for everyone..kids and adults. give it a try. you will be glad you did!
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|Did not finish. I was very disappointed! Using the play technique was okay, but the setting seemed like a big joke.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|slow start and hard to believe that the girl is quite so stupid or naive at 25- very explicit and unbelievable- no real woman would put up with this BS
B003EVWDR0|5.0|i gave this movie 5 stars because of the special effects and the acting,i thought they were fantastic.and not to forget the soundtrack.it was also fantastic all this brought togather by a wonderful cast and writers
B009KEN87O|3.0|Fun shooter, but has issues.  Does not like to come back from a pause properly.  If that is fixed, I'd download again.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great show. Interesting characters and beautiful scenery. I look forward to every episode.  Love It! Ty not to miss a show. ;0)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I breezed through all three because it was easy reading. It had alittle bit of everything, humor, action, and of course adventure! I was sad when I finished. It became part of my past time.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|This is a fun and addictive game. Handy pocket game to distract the kids for hours.  Thanks Rovio for the game.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|fast paced and habit forming- frustrating a bit when the ones that fall are not what you need to beat the level- nice variety
B005K17RU0|5.0|Easy to use.  Quick and simple.  Always check the weather before heading out.  This app makes it easy!  I would highly recommend.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I saw the movie first and then wanted to read the book.  The movie was good, but the book is much better.  A little on the &#34;life is perfect&#34; side, but still a great book.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Ebay is great on the Fire!  What can I say that has not been said about Ebay!  Buyer beware! The app works.  That is all.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Having read other near death experiences, I was interested in Dr. Alexander's story.Simply put, it is amazing.It has changed my whole way of thinking, because he tells us of God's totally unconditional love. It's pure comfort.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I love the exciting hidden games takes your mind off of the everyday stuff it's worth the money for the entertainment.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|after reading the first two i guess i expected mind blowing something not the same stuff as the first two books
B00522Q6CM|1.0|X-Men dvd doesn't work properly... It has no visible scratches but gets stuck between scenes 8-12.  Other two dvds work well.
B001I45UFC|5.0|C.S. Lewis is an amazing author in his own little world. I have read his complete Narnia series an have also watched The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, Prince Caspian, and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, and a proud owner of these three movies and in these three movies I have watched they have proved that C.S lewis has his own little world. I absolutely love this author and his books.They are very inspirational.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I LOVE this series!  I recommend it!  Being a Prime member, I was able to view seasons 1 & 2.  I cannot wait for the next season!
B005IQZB14|5.0|Articulate in how the PCT trail gives her time to heal her emotional wounds... and how strong and brave she becomes in tackling all the trail has to offer. Very well written.
B0097S0TM0|5.0|Great sound, lyrics, and a powerfull voice. Pink made an inspirational CD about Love. The name tells everything. Her best CD.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|habit forming- it keeps you going never boring always keeps the eyes and mind in action- addicting to the max
0375831002|4.0|Although this is very sad, you can find beauty and humor and kindness in this story of World War II told from &#34;Death's&#34; persepctive
B008AYA7WE|3.0|LIKES:<br />1) The backgrounds are great and make the game more enjoyable, and the blocks are nicely shaped and colored.<br />2) The levels slowly build up speed, so you're not frantic by the 6th level. LOL!<br /><br />DISLIKES:<br />1) Part of the control buttons are underneath the bottom Kindle menu, which never closes, so I often hit the back arrow when I'm trying to hit the game's down control. It's not a BIG deal, since the game auto-saves and can be resumed, but it's annoying.<br />2) More aggravating is the unreliability of the next-up blocks shown; it's difficult to plan ahead when what's shown to be the succeeding block changes once I get the current block placed.<br /><br />CONFUSED ABOUT:<br />1) At times it seemed that once I placed a block, it would not be in the same position after a row was eliminated, which left a space beneath that I would have to clear the top rows to get to and fill, but this only happened a few times, so maybe it was my handling?<br />2) There were 1 or 2 quick sound blips but no sound otherwise. I don't care either way, though.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Many sounds.  Perfect for travel or anytime away from home.  I only wish the heartbeat sound was better--more womb-like. I'm sure will come in handy
B00BRR66SA|5.0|Justin Timberlake has really come back with a bang! This a great album you can listen straight through. Totally seeing it #1 on Billboard it's first week of sales.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Most post apocalyptic, dystopian books are pretty depressing, but this one was intriguing and compelling. I would love to read more of them.
B002JYPV3G|5.0|Regardless of what everyone else thinks, this is one of the best debut albums out there. Plenty of raw energy.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I highly recommend this film.  I will watch it several tmes.  Even in 2-D, it has a 3-D look to it.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This story was very informative and kept my interest. Great characters as always. Was not disappointed as he continues to be Qmaster story teller.
B006M7JCC2|3.0|Interesting, however too much of the same context was writen several times without my being able to discern or understand her message.  Perhaps I am biased in my own beliefs.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|Tin Tin seems really kiddish on the surface, and you think the plot is going to be &#34;educational&#34; or something, but it's actually more like an Indiana Jones movie--lots of chases, escapes, maps, and mystery.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|I enjoyed every minute if this movie.  It showed a side of the these three actors I have never seen before and they were awesome!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is so epically amazing! I love playing it and challenging myself! I like playing each game over and over in tell I can perfect each game!
B0039TD7PY|5.0|You can beat the music of James Taylor or Carol King when they sing separately, however in this album when they sing togeather the music is outstanding<br /><br />ED Bates
B00B47M49S|5.0|Before I saw this film, I had heard many different dancers and choreographers talking about Dance Theater Wuppertal and it's resident choreographer Pina Bausch- as if she was almost a legend- and someone very respected for creative work. Now I understand why. I watched this movie with some people who are dancers and with some non-dancers. The non-dancers really thought the movie was interesting and could relate to it, or it gave them something to think about and captured their attention, whereas sometimes 'regular modern dance' is hard to follow for non-dancers. I believe this is because of the elements of humanity Pina was able to emanate through her work. I found it inspiring and thought-provoking, and still think about parts of the movie/am processing it several weeks later.
B007HACDLK|4.0|great book, enjoyed every page...Vince Flynn never fails to write a great book and it will keep you on the edge of your seat.
B00BIQU1K4|5.0|In a time when most music is a fast 3 minute orgasm or bomb, Steve Wilson produces music that provides the listener a a musical treat.  Especially for prog rockers.  Take it this genre is not for everyone, I will take this music anyday.  This album reminds me of the music I grew up with, such as Yes, early Genesis, Pink Floyd, etc.  Thank ou Steve for this gift.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|A bit bloody for those who do not like to watch that sort of thing, but an EXCELLENT STORY! Beautiful music!
B008TRUDAS|4.0|A great book in exploring the emotions of a very mature teenager and how she handles love for a new acquaintance, upon arriving at a new home.  She is also faced with her mom and the aspect of losing her; while having a younger brother to raise.  All help each other in this move forward with all it's stepping stones.  I would recommend this book!
B004WGIXX4|4.0|Adorable and quite funny but I wish the ending was more something... I hate when movies just end with, well, how this one ended.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Liked the story line and the acting. Entertaining movie with state of the art special effects. We ended up watching the movie twice in two days on a single rental.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|A book that will make you angry, cry and see goodness.  Beautifully told and takes you on a trip that you are glad you are the reader and not the character.  I highly recommend it but know that its story will stay with you for a very long time.
B006LSZECO|2.0|With all of the press on this book I expected more.<br />It was ok in the beginning but got really far fetched.
B000SGGUWS|4.0|I decided to read the books since pll is off until June, and its my guilty pleasure! I can't get enough and can't wait to see what happens next!
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I really like The Tudors series and had to own it. This product was exactly what I wanted and was exactly as it was described.
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|It doesn't really follow the plot of the book at all, and starts to pull in information from the second book in the series The Power of Six.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|Long tracks, good beats! If you enjoyed his previous albums, you'll be pleased with this one. Best listened to with either a good pair of headphones or a good system.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Got through the series, disappointed and skimmed over MANY pages.  Cannot recommed it to anyone,  what a distortion of love.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love this game. I keep wanting to beat levels & if I don't I keep going. Fun if you get bored & want something else to do while there is snow outside.
0262731541|5.0|We love this so much we bought a second copy when the one we lent a friend never came back to us.  I guess he liked it too...
B00BGICG5W|5.0|This was a very funny movie. The relationship the two characters have is very real and you get a lot of enjoyment out of watch them interact. The funniest movie of year.
B002EDH0FE|4.0|Saw it in the theaters and holds up to the small screen as well. Super-hero action movie with great plot. If you liked V for vendetta, you'll probably like this, the graphic novel it's based on is by the same author.
B005OT2YVA|1.0|I only have a few sentences to describe how awful this movie is.<br /><br />1. An incoherent mess of pictures and sounds.<br />2. Worse than reading the bible.<br />3. Possibly the worst movie ever.<br />4. I think the government used taxpayer money to make this film.<br />5. Nationalist message equating decepticons to terrorists and autobots as the heroic American military.<br />6. You will hate yourself for watching this film.<br /><br />To write out in detail the problems would be a waste of my time.
0910226466|5.0|I was happy to find a hard copy was sent instead of a paperback. Though it was missing the cover sleeve, I didn't mind. The book is in excellent condition.
B00709GTGS|5.0|Like Somewhere in Time, just relax and enjoy. The cast flows wonderfully together and great for a lazy afternoon. Big bowl of popcorn recommended.
B004H6G0TI|2.0|No provision to swap the joystick and the fire button. 40 years of flying with my right hand  makes it very hard to control left handed. Might have been a good game except for that. Other flying games I have used are all right handed.
B00271HAK8|5.0|Life moves pretty fast, so enjoy this often. Brilliant film and always fun to watch and share with the youngsters.
B00BESIKWM|1.0|Terrible. Filmography looke like it was done in the 80's. plot was lame, figured it out within 10 minutes of it beginning. Final fight scene between main characters was....  A hug!  Come on!  Nurses were kind of cool and monster's fight at the end was cool, but that's about it.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|You will have seen most of the actors before, on numerous occasions. All are great at their craft and put on an entertaining and funny show. Not award-winning material (as far as I know), but quite entertaining when there's little on TV that capture one's attention.
B00884GR0W|3.0|I like this game and stuff but the only problem with it is that the graphics are terable, Its been a while sense I played it and all I see is pixels. I've tried all the settings but most of the time it just freezes for reasons I don't know.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is fascinating, engrossing, and somewhat disturbing.  Definitely adult reading, but very well written.  Great for a rainy day on vacation.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|A boys quest to find his treasure. Sounds hoaky but it is not. I enjoy the simplicity of this book with a lovely message. A great read for any age.
B0060AY6FO|3.0|This is a bit too romantic compared to the original book, but an interesting look at the hero of the story.
B0051OZ564|1.0|Had lots of potential, but made no sense and jumped around and was just plain stupid. Basically a way to try to get as much action/fight scenes in a movie as possible and provide people with eye candy. And the fight scenes repeated themselves, so not even original. It's like they had th same script for each of the fight scenes, this time is nazi zombies you're fighting, now it's robots, so action packed if you like watching the same scene 5 times.
B00BJA2VFW|2.0|It bombed out after playing several times; the play button turned dark and the Adventure game was not playable.  I've played free games that lasted longer.  Very disappointed.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|Esta saga es de las mejores que se han realizado en el cine. Muy recomendada la calidad de los extras de este set de DVD
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was really good. One of my favorites. It had so many twists in it. So much better than the movie, which I am glad I saw after I read the book.
B00846WWVM|3.0|The functions are difficult to control. So many times aiming is off (or I am just really that bad!)<br />But the sound is great and the water and aliens are adorable!  It's very sad when you make a mistake and their homes burn to a crisp.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|One of those films that you need to watch and reflect over afterwards.<br /><br />I recommend viewing it at least once.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Love the twist on everyone's favorite holiday characters. Fun, action-packed and although a little scary, our 4 year old enjoyed it, so not too bad even for little ones.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I like the ease of this app. its nice to be able to go back and add notes and information to previous notes.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was a heart warming story.  I found myself laughing, crying and cheering.  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a happy ending.
B00BF11STU|5.0|This is an engaging, historical, a must see movie.  We would highly recommend this. Some parental discretion advised, particularly with questioning of detainees.
B006OZKX02|1.0|Outside of a tiny mention in the product specs, it was not mention in the title or long product description that this item would not play in a US player.  The return was easy though so everything is cool.  I think if you sell a non-region 1 DVD or blu- ray, you should put this info in the product title.
1423101502|5.0|The character of Percy Jackson is quite endearing.  I have read this series along with my son and we both loved it.  Good writing and a lot of fun.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My 4 year old loved this. Super cute, funny and sweet. Only caution is that one of the characters hits himself with a hammer, now my munchkin wants to do the same. Watch out!  :)
B00BWJARHO|2.0|by far the worst movie to view i ever rented from amazon. i was very dissappointed. they should have mentioned it was made for wide screen t.v.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|It is a great app I love it is great for 1 or 2 players people all around will enjoy your new app
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book is a must read for the  introvert who is struggling with feelings of inadequacy for not being like \\"everyone else\\". I wish the extroverts out there would read it too, because so often we are misunderstood.  I learned of this book on my workplace networking site. I am truly hoping the leaders of my orgnization see the discussion and are compelled to read it as well. I think it could lead organizations in a new and inspiring way. This book is well written and the author writes in a way to keep you hooked.  I love the references to other famous introverts from past to present day.  Thank you so much Susan Cain for bringing this topic to light.  The weight began to lift off my shoulders from page one.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I liked the first two seasons, and this one was just as addictive. Well worth the price of going to a movie.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I am a JG fan, and have read almost all of his books. I was disappointed with the ending. The body of the book was good, but the ending was lacking.
B003Z71OO6|4.0|Movie was wonderful, but it was difficult to watch in one sitting because of technical errors due to Amazonvideo. The great news was that Amazon took it upon their own initiative to review our watching and refunded my $3.99. I was emailed an apology and my account was credited.<br />Thank you Amazon!<br />I will be buying this movie so that I can watch it in one sitting!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Once you start viewing these it gets you looking forward to the next ones and its interesting to see all the different styles of clothes they wore.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This app is great for my kindle  fire hd . It is so great my family loves it .  Enjoy this great  app .
B008CPZNL6|5.0|This kinda reminds me of Windows 8.  You can flip through the things you have, like magazines, news, electronics, old and upcoming things, to read.  I recommend this to everyone who loves to read, see pics and learn
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have already read several books by this author and he quickly became one of my favorites of our time and recent history.  It is a historical novel that is written  closely to historical facts without being history. He understands the social, economic and political problems of the times as if he lived in each country for a long time, he knows the persons who influenced history and two world  wars. He has a thorough understanding of how a  leader, not only charismatic one but also one who promises the masses of poor, and uneducated permanent jobs and material possessions. Good people trust his slogans and promises and quickly develop a strong trust  in him and let themselves be driven to a catastrophic future.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|What a great cast and just loved the premise and the flash back to all that was the early 1960's.  Been there done that got the t-shirt didn't want it ha! But the movie and the young actors especially were outstanding! Ed Norton was flawless! What a cool role for him to have taken on!
B0007LCNKC|5.0|An album that takes you on trip of growing intensity - it finally erupts with the stand out tracks Abel and Mr November
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Kami Garcia is such a great writer, this series sucked me in and I wished there were more to read.  Cant wait for her next book to come out.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|I read this book when Kris Kyle was still living.  The story is a sad story about a man who grew larger than life itself.  Although his life was that of an American hero. It did nothing to inspire me to want to be someone recognized for killing many of the enemy.  I was a Marine Corps Medic during the Vietnam era.  Once a Marinem, always a Marine.  We did a job and he did it well.  He was the best at his honorable job. The news of his unfortunate and untimly death left me with the feeling those that live by the sword usually die by the sword.<br />I would like to take a moment to thank his widow and children for their sacrifice. The, family too, should be honored for their contribution to their Hero's effort.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Great Jack Reacher reading.  I loved that he joined forces with his friends from the past.  Exciting to the end.  Didn't want  to stop reading.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|This is a terrific CD to own, especially if you've seen the movie, but also the stage production.  Ann Hathaway, Russel Crowe and Hugh Jackman's voices are excellent.
B0071MV540|4.0|So nice to see Eddie Murphy back in action and lovin life! I love these types of action/comedies and look foward to more by these directors.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This was a really fun challenging game.  It makes you solve problems like how to get from one place to another without burning up or being killed by dinosaurs.  I had a great time getting all the puzzle pieces, sometimes had to ask friends for help!  It took a while to get through all the levels, so definatly worth it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app I can take care of my own horse! I don't know why you wouldn't get it! esspecially if you what to own a horse!!!
B00129H7VS|5.0|The set is great!<br />The metal cover, the quality of sound and image and the blu-ray extras (particularly the comments of the veterans during the episodes) are worth every cent!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Great season of Game of Thrones. Just wish I could get season 3 earlier or episode by episode throughout the season.
B00B99KJR0|3.0|It is a pretty decent match game with a story line,  only downfall is that to keeps wanting you to rate it
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|We just got done watching it and both the kids and my wife loved it. It has humor for everyone from kids to adults.
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|I don't want to actually write a review.  Just give it 5 stars. words words words words words words words
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is over good and is quite easy and can b  played by many ages [[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]
B0086700CM|5.0|It is so fun hard to stop playing!!!!! You will be so surprised that u cant stop playing the game!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was totally different than any book I had ever read.  There was so much drive to find out what happened, then you add some crazy twists, and you just can't put it down.  By the end, I disliked both characters immensely, but I still liked the book, which sounds crazy  It is definitely a book you will remember..
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|I just love Florida Georgia Lines sound. It's definitely for country fans, but it's just a great cd. The songs are so upbeat that listening is so much fun!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent acting and a storyline that keeps you wanting more.Captures the upstairs / downstairs relationships of The Lord of the Manor and the servants.
0743270754|5.0|This is an excellent piece of biographical, social, and political history. I suspect people interested in the battles and a military history will be disappointed, since this is not that book. Lincoln was not at the battlefields but was in Washington waiting for news of each battle. The book delves into the anxiety he experienced waiting for news from battles. It provides a background on Lincoln's perspective of each of his generals. There is his life with Mary, his sons, and the toll of losing his eldest son in great detail. There is a discussion of Washington society, parties, dresses, and social life. Kern delves into Lincoln's early years in Illinois, his political disappointments. His rise to a prominent Lawyer, and his intellect is eloquently presented.<br /><br />I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie, and came away with the desire to read additional books by Doris Kearn.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This has to be one of the most fun, addicting little apps I've picked up in a long while. I was lucky enough to grab it when it was the FAotD but for those without that luxury I would say it's well worth the couple of dollars.<br /><br />When playing this game time literally escaped me and suddenly it was an hour later, my fiancee was coming to get me for dinner and I had failed to do literally anything I had planned to, like take a quick a shower or tidy up. Fortunately I managed to get ready by the time he arrived but I would highly recommend setting an alarm such as on your phone in case you need to be somewhere and can't afford to be late due to killing pixels.<br /><br />The biggest thing that plagues games like this the looming threat of repetition. How many times can we stare at a screen killing pixels of various sizes and colors before it becomes boring?<br /><br />Well, Voxel Invader's manages to keep you engaged and on edge up to the end.  The final levels are teeth gritting hard at times and even up to that point you'll find yourself completely focused on completing each phase to proceed through the levels.<br /><br />For Kindle Fire HD users it control like a dream. I think it's the most responsive game I've played and being able to flit your little space craft in and out of enemy fire to pick up stars and world destroying power ups is extremely satisfying.<br /><br />On top of that, I do find myself going back to earlier levels to see if I can do better, go faster and on different difficulties. On most games I find doing this a waster of time. In fact I'm a raider in WoW (usually healer or tank) and when the current content is cleared on normal the last thing I want to do is go back and do the whole thing over again on heroic where bosses apparently ate their Wheaties that morning and can hit harder and have a bit more health. Yer for this game, going back and playing the same levels over again to get better and better and to progress and finish everything on hard is something I enjoy and want to do.<br /><br />Bravo, Voxel Invaders. Bravo
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I loved it.  I am a big crime fan, did they do it, did they not, do they get caught/convicted?  Add the family dynamics and it is a great read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I LOVED this book as sad as some parts were, it was a GREAT book!! Absolutely enjoyed the ending of it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Captures the changes in the Lords and servants lives after WW1 with the introduction of the Industrial Revolution<br />A must see for historians and romantics!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|All three seasons have been great with many surprises.  I don't know if I can wait until January for season four to start.  Great.
B004H6G0TI|4.0|Playing this game makes me miss using a true joystick - you know those little handles sticking out of a grey box with perhaps a couple colorful buttons on it that most haven't truly used since circa 1985. This is the type of game perfected for that piece of hardware that makes me want to dig mine out even though the Kindle would simply look at that antiquated technology and permanently shut itself down before being attached to something so quaint.<br /><br />Instead we are given a touchscreen joystick and it's amusing at times to see something that would be considered retro be recreated for current technology. I'm not completely sold on touchscreen joysticks as my fingers tend to not slide well at times and it requires holding the Kindle in a certain way so I can move and shot at the same time in these games.  Yet for MiniSquadrom it's the only type of control that I can see working and for what it is, it works well and is responsive.<br /><br />In this game you fight waves of planes in a small area.  Unlike games of this genre of yor where you continued to pass the background as you shot down the enemy, you are kept between two invisible walls that you fly between. While it is obvious that you do not want to hit the ground, if you fly up too high you can also stall, which is a nice touch. Sadly the instructions for the stall about turning into the way you are falling isn't all that helpful when you are falling straight down. Trial and error will make you a pro at recovering from a stall.<br /><br />There are power-ups in the game that looking like falling stars of different colors that you can catch. If they hit an enemy plane first they're gone. They are a bit finicky and you have to be careful that you aren't going to run into the ground while desperately trying to grab one. You can also pick up extra lives and the hearts remain flying around on screen long enough to give you a fair chance to grab them.  And you will want to grab them because as enemies become more dangerous you will die a lot due to poorly timed stall recoveries right into area of affect attacks. Fortunately your little plane is made from the strongest metal known to the dwarfs of Moria and can be riddled with bullets, missiles and other planes running straight through it before you finally crash and burn like the irresponsible hero you are.<br /><br />The one thing I truly dislike is when it tells you that you've completed the wave or reached a check point. The message itself appears in a bar across the middle of the screen with the rest slightly darkened.  But the game is not paused. So if you have chosen this unfortunate time to go into a stall it's going to be that much harder to recover. I'm fine with giving me messages but if it's going to be in the way of the game then the game needs to be paused or the message needs to be moved.<br /><br />All in all this is a fun little game. Looking at the price I recall getting most of the shooters I played two decades ago for around $5 from a bargain bin, so the price seems fair for the content.  There are 56 planes you can unlock total and looking at the shadows of yet to earn planes raises many questions such as how can I ride a trident and when did whales learn to fly.  It could be very interesting to see what all these planes look like and do.<br /><br />It works well, for all you Kindle Fire HD users out there.  I would give it between 3.5 - 4 stars with a few extra points to providing classical music that is complimentary to blowing things up.
B000S88JTS|5.0|This docudrama contains all the beginning riders and stars that made the sport famous.  Shows the hard skills that were formed from dirt and bone.

B00AEFY08O|5.0|WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!<br /><br /> Forrest Gump is a movie that is held dearly in the hearts of audiences. It has won six Oscars, and has also claimed 38 other wins as well as 44 various nominations. Forrest Gump is an endearing story that follows the life of a man with a low IQ as he goes through a series of random of events. The movie's spans over several decades of Gump's life as the audience are also able to catch a glimpse of some of the defining moments of the latter part of the 20th century such as the Vietnam War. Forrest Gump is able to capture defining events in American history with surprising accuracy without losing its wit and charm. According to Newsweek critic, David Ansen, \\"For all its ambition, the movie ends up using great historical events in the service of a dubious sentimentality.\\" Forrest Gump has intrigued and won the hearts of many with its lovable characters and simple plot. Set in the backdrop of one of America's most tumultuous times, Forrest Gump provides accurate information without sacrificing its appeal to audiences.<br /><br />Summary<br /><br /> The movie begins as Forrest, the main character, is sitting at a bus stop. A stranger sits next to Forrest, prompting him to begin telling his story of how he got to that bus stop.<br /> Forrest's story begins when he is a young boy. On his first day of school, he meets Jenny, a prominent character, on the bus. As a young boy with leg braces, the other boys constantly tease Forrest as they throw rocks at him. However, one day, as he is attempting to escape his tormentors, Forrest discovers his knack for running, landing him a football scholarship in college. After college, Forrest then decides to join the army where he is sent to Vietnam to fight in the Vietnam War. There, Forrest meets a significant character in the story, Bubba. Together, they formulate a plan to start up a shrimp boat once they leave the war. However, in a turn of events, Forrest's platoon is attacked, Bubba is killed and Forrest is awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for saving his friends and colleagues.<br /> While recovering from injuries sustained from the war, Forrest discovers his ability to play ping-pong, gaining him both riches and fame. With the money he earns, Forrest lays the foundation for him and Bubba's `shrimping' company. While his business is initially unsuccessful, after a series of events, his business eventually flourishes, leaving him with copious amounts of money. Forrest then returns home to attend to his mother's final days. While at home, Jenny returns back into Forrest's life and promptly leaves after he declares his love for her. Her departure prompts Forrest to begin running and he continued to run nonstop three and a half years.<br /> Back in present day at the bus stop, Forrest reveals that he is there to visit Jenny, who has written him a letter. When he meets her, she reveals that they have a son together, Forrest Jr. and that she is dying of an incurable disease. Together, Jenny, Forrest and Forrest Jr. move back to Alabama, where Jenny and Forrest are married. Shortly after their marriage, Jenny dies.<br /><br />Characters and Actors<br /><br /> While some critics may be divided on issues about the plot, there seems to be a general consensus about Tom Hanks' performance as Forrest Gump. There is no doubt that this may be his best performance. Hanks not only personifies Forrest, he embodies the character, becoming one with him. He creates depth for a character that on paper is so simple. He makes Forrest lovable and extremely believable. He is able to portray this simple-minded man with perfection, all down to Forrest's strong Southern accent and absentminded stupidity. According to Peter Travers of the Rolling Stones, \\"It's Hanks who brings humor and unforced humanity to the literary conceit of Forrest, though the slim actor scarcely resembles the 6-foot-6-inch, 240-pound bruiser of the book.\\" With no doubt, Tom Hanks is the shining star of this film as ability to portray such a character with such grace is equally astounding and worthy of applause.<br /> Another character of importance is Jenny, played by Robin Wright. While Wright's performance appears intermittently throughout the film, her presence cannot be forgotten. As is required, Wright definitely exudes the strength and the resilience that the role requires. However, while Wright does well to bring the character to life, her performance is overshadowed by her colleague's, Tom Hanks', performance. Wright's performance delivers what is necessary to portray the character, but it is definitely not the dazzling display that Hanks has appeared to give.<br /><br />Historical Accuracy<br /><br /> Forrest Gump is not only a movie with a great plot, within it, great history woven within. Set in the latter part of the 20th Century, Forrest Gump is able to give audiences a glimpse into the historical events of the time with surprising accuracy.<br /> One of the first historical events to occur is the integration of races in schools all across America. The movie depicts a mob surrounding several African American students as they shuffle into the school. Just as what occurred in real life, the movie shows the military assisting the African American students into the school as the mob attempts to resist their admittance into the university.<br /> Hurricane Carmen was also mentioned in the movie. While on the most part it is quite accurate, there are a few discrepancies. While the film accurately depicted the damage the hurricane brought upon the `shrimping' industry, in reality, the hurricane itself did not actually damage the industry. It was actually the ecological effects of hurricane. When Hurricane Carmen hit, the consistency of the water where the shrimp lived, causing stress to the shrimp and an eventual depletion in the population of shrimp. The movie was right about another thing however; Bubbagump Shrimp Company was actually established around the time of the hurricane.<br /> A big chunk of Forrest Gump is actually dedicated to the Vietnam War. While it does accurately depict the events, the movie made it seem like the war was just another war. In other words, it did not really depict the severity of the situation. In reality, the Vietnam War was the longest war in U.S. history and it was a war where many men didn't know what they were fighting for. However, overall, the film quite accurately portrays the Vietnam War. There indeed was a lot of heavy rain and there were many ambushes as well. Very briefly throughout this segment of the film, the word `humping' was mentioned. This word was actually a very common word amongst soldiers of the Vietnam War. It's meaning is to walk, march or carry things. Moreover, the film also accurately portrayed Nixon's escalation of the war as well as the American public's response to the war. When Forrest returned to Washington D.C., he found himself in a public rally against the war. The film correctly shows the public sentiment against the war, as well as the people participating (Hippies).<br /> Another event that occurred within the movie was the infamous Watergate scandal where a break-in occurred at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate office complex. Nixon's administration tried to cover up their involvement. However, the scandal led to his eventual resignation. In Forrest Gump, Forrest actually discovers the scandal while complaining about lights keeping up him in the Watergate office across from his hotel. In the film, Forrest makes a call to the security guard, Frank Wills, who was the actual guard on duty that night who discovered the break in.<br /> In the movie, Forrest Gump is depicted as a celebrity ping-pong player. While some of the events in both the movie and book are exaggerated, it is true that the ping-pong team was the first group of Americans to visit China since 1949.<br /> Overall, Forrest Gump is great story, woven in with some of America's greatest historical events. While there are some inaccuracies, such discrepancies are few. According Todd McCarthy of Variety, \\"A picaresque story of a simpleton's charmed odyssey through 30 years of tumultuous American history, Forrest Gump is whimsy with a strong cultural spine.\\" For those hoping to watch an exciting and humorous movie intertwined with history, Forrest Gump is the movie for you.
B000002KYR|5.0|Good Trade, great shape, excellent sounds, and the vintage disc is in very good shape.  Good job, all the way around.
B0067R0APK|3.0|I had expected that this upgraded Accuweather app would include at least the option of seeing lightning and hail and the like, for when the weather is getting scary and we need to know?  Nope.  Fairly good radar, with no adjustment of opacity.  I'd like to see severe details instead of graphing (?!?) temperatures.  Disappointing.

B00B7G3NFU|4.0|Better than I expected. Well done, low keyed drama about a paralyzed man seeking a sexual experience. The most salient experience however is that of the man and the people he touches with his personality. John Hawkes, Helen Hunt are excellent. Thoughtful movie, worthwhile experience.

B0000DZ3EN|5.0|I remember watching this movie when I was a kid and I loved it. I'm in my late 20's now and I just recently saw the film again on one of the movie channels (I think it was HBO) and it still holds strong. It's not perfect, but it's still a really good movie. One thing that I really admire about it is that it has a very dark tone. I think kids today don't get to experience those types of movies anymore and it's a real shame.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|FANTASTIC app would have paid for it...It is the best Bible app I have seen...have recommended it to others....get it
B007SGLZP8|4.0|If you're like me and you've taken a few chances on your last few novels and been burned, and you need a sure thing to read, Grisham rarely disappoints.  A lot happening outside the courtroom on this one and the twist is great.  Once again, the FBI is not so good and our hero definitely gets the best of them.  No loose ends in the end as all the details are seen to as usual by Mr. Grisham.  If you like his &#34;stuff&#34; you should enjoy this one.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|The names of the stars tell you a lot about this film. Rekindling romance after 30 years or so. As expected, acting is very competent, production values are high. Pleasant, light drama with elements of humor that will entertain most audiences.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|There wasn't much not to love. Abby wasn't just the good little girl from Kansas who was attracted to the bad boy fighter like many other story lines. She held her own and tried to resist as long as she could. But who could resist and not love a that a guy would literally walk through fire for you.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Denzel Washington portrays an alcoholic pilot who eventually comes to grips with that fact due to an experience in the cockpit. He give a good performance and the supporting cast does their job. Some films entertain for the duration of the film, others longer. This film is in the first category.

B004J4WKUQ|3.0|The time and effort the author spent on researching this novel are substantial and should be considered. The story itself reminded me of when i played Doom and Halo with my grandchildren, presently  in college. I  think it is a book that will be better appreciated by young adults who hold a fond memory of these games
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I'm giving this 5 stars even though we have not used it yet.  This will be used when we are away from home and have yet gone anywhere since we got the app, but from what I have seen it will be a good travel companion...

B006S08RLU|3.0|French film about an odd young woman seeking a certain man. The search is triggered by some boyish artifacts she finds hidden in a wall crevice.  Audrey Tautou is attractive displaying an innocent but determined naif who will find her man. Typically French in a light hearted breezy style. Entertaining.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|A wonderful and heart breaking movie of the holocaust through the eyes of children. Two boys who didn't know they were supposed to be enemies instead, became friends.<br />The innocents of their friendship, and the loyalty to one another, makes this movie a classic before it's time.
0345803485|3.0|I've debated a few titles for this one.. Fifty Shades of Bad, etc. I'm sure we've heard it all from the BDSM community about how E. L. James butchered her attempt at good BDSM erotica. And I agree. However, I don't think it's all bad, which is why I gave her 3 stars.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good plot, great writing, great erotica and good BDSM this is not the book for you. The book is clearly based on Twilight. It's very reminiscent of fan fiction. The main heroine, Anna Steele, is klutzy, innocent, and unaware of her beauty (Bella Swan anyone?) and Christian Grey is the mysterious hero who is so drawn to her, yet he's trying to fight the attraction, albeit not very hard and quite unsuccessfully. He even tries to warn her off just like Edward in Twilight. Except his reason isn't that he might suck her dry or turn her into a bloodsucker, hence destroying her soul (Edward's concern). Christian Grey's reason is that he's a sadist and wants to paddle her ass... I'm still not sure why that's a bad thing, so I never understood trying to warn Anna off.<br /><br />Also, E. L. James based the book in Washington, just like Twilight, but for some odd reason she didn't research the local lingo and has Anna Steele \\"phoning\\" and \\"ringing\\" people, going \\"on holiday\\" and using a \\"smart rucksack.\\" I'm not  expecting Dickens' ability to bring characters to life by using the dialect specific to their station and location, but a reasonable understanding the local slang would have been nice.<br /><br />My biggest issue with Fifty Shades of Grey is that it's clear that E. L. James did just about as much research on BDSM as she did on the local American slang. That's pretty irresponsbile, especially with how popular this book is. She portrays Christian Grey as an experienced Dominant and Sadist. Anna Steele is a complete innocent. She's a virgin and doesn't even know that kink exists until she sees Christian's \\"red room of pain,\\" as she dubs it. That's all fine and good, for a natural submissive and/or masochist that wouldn't matter... It's sometimes nice to see how a character develops while struggling through accepting a darker part of themselves, such as reconciling being a submissive woman in a society where we're taught that we shouldn't let men \\"subjugate\\" us, etc.<br /><br />However, Anna really isn't submissive and she's not a masochist. She enjoys fun bedroom games and she's okay with submitting sexually with very minimal pain involved... which, again, is perfectly fine. To each their own. The issue I have is that E. L. James doesn't let it be a discovery of fun bedroom games, she makes it into a big mental health issue for Christian Grey... She portrays his sadistic tendencies as a deep-rooted mental health issue that started in his childhood and put it on par with Edward Cullen's dilemma in Twilight - turn Bella into a vampire and destroy her soul or kill her by accident or let her go. Come on now... that's a bit dramatic. So Christian wants to beat Anna's ass. He's kinky, not a psychopath and not a vampire in danger of losing control and killing her by accident. Can I roll my eyes? Cause I did. A lot.<br /><br />Though, really, I don't think that E. L. James knows what a good Dominant is like... cause Christian is way more domineering than just plain dominant. But whatever. Otherwise, he's your fairy tale prince with lots of $$$, class, generosity, ability to dance and the ability to be in the right place at the right time whenever you need him in that right place... cause maybe it was the wrong place for you and you needed him there to make it right. Yeah, cliche. Also, did I mention it's Twilight with a BDSM twist and no vampires? In case, I didn't mention it, let me just reaffirm that it is. Down to the part where the hero buys the heroine a new car because her old car wasn't up to his snuff.<br /><br />Okay, so the book takes us through their journey together - Anna coming to terms with her devious bedroom desires and learning to deal with Christian's domineering ways, while Christian learns to rein in his sadistic and domineering tendencies to keep Anna from running the other way. There was a bad guy, as most of these types of romance books have. There were some hardships they needed to overcome, a little bit of heartbreak. And, of course, there's a happily ever after with lots of love.

B009EEFTMC|5.0|great and fun game when you need to take a break from an other project it takes anywhere from 8 to 10 minutes or a little more...
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Awesome!!!!! Comes with narration to it was very fun to read the wizard of oz. Love it,couldn't put it down.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|One of those films that will stay with you long after the end credits. I highly recommend it. Superb film.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is an amazing book to read. Must read for anybody who wants to hear about seal missions from their point of view.
1933492953|2.0|Whenever you watch a movie and have that feeling of déjà vu, when the lame movie you're watching reminds you of that other lame movie you saw that other time, it's because they are using the clichés found in this book. Clichés are craft without thought and what they produce is mindless entertainment, see Clash of the Titans remake. It's important to know this stuff from an academic and historical perspective and having it in one book is a bit of a convenience, but still it's kind of like a very stripped down basic visual dictionary of common notions that can be found all over the internet... for example the concept of keeping the camera on one side of the action, that isn't even a rule or a principle it's a specific instance of a principle and examples of it being \\"broken\\" can be found in many examples by great artists. This book essentially fails because it never asks or answers the two basic questions: \\"Why do people look at a picture?\\", and \\"Why do people look from one picture to the next in sequence?\\".
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this product it is super fun and cool..... amazing!!!!this game gets better as you go and it has a fun little tune to it as you go.!!!!!!!!

B00BESM14U|4.0|Well done.  Was not sure I would like it, but it was quite engaging.  Liked the role played by the woman from Harry Potter movies.
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|glad I didn't pay money in the theater to see this.  not a TERRIBLE film but not great either.  entertaining enough and beautiful to look at but slightly off.  and a bit difficult to follow.
0060191325|5.0|I recommend this book for not only the start of every relationship but also the start of parenting because this book helps to understand the genders and I feel that it helps a parent to understand and communicate to their child based on Dr Gray's theories of the man (grown boys) and woman (grown girls).
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Hard to take our eyes off the screen.  Such beauty! Such terror! So inspiring and so implausible. Yet, so real.  A movie I could watch over and over.

B008O9V4C2|5.0|Have always been a fan of  Steely Dan & this CD makes the old Steely Dan with a new twist really enjoyable.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|GREAT film.  unexpected.  subtle.  highly recommended!  strong actors, unique story line and a nice change from the usual romantic film.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|I'm not sure what allt he fuss is about for this game. Angry birds was great, and still is.  This game gets kinda boring after a day or so.  If on the train or sitting in a car for a long time, and you don't want to concentrate too much, then I suppose this game is okay.  My 6-year old loved it at first, but even he is bored by now and is back to playing angry birds.
B00936A0RU|5.0|I live in West Virginia on the border with Kentucky and have had work-related reasons to visit Franklin County.  Much of it is still little different from its appearance and portrayal in the first-rate film Lawless.<br /><br />As presented in Lawless, Franklin County might be characterized as \\"Bloody Franklin,\\" roughly comparable to Harlan County or \\"Bloody Harlan,\\" the setting for never-ending, violent conflict between coal miners on their way to early graves from Black Lung and gun thugs aided and abetted by corrupt officials working for Big Coal.  Lawless, however, takes a different, though equally ugly and violent tack, focusing on the production and distribution of bootleg whiskey.<br /><br />Lawless romanticizes the lives and times of bootleggers in unashamed fashion, presenting them as tough-as-a-nickel-steak  heroes with a good deal of homespun integrity.  By contrast, their most conspicuous adversaries are caricatures of legally sanctioned viciousness and in-your-face arrogance, outsiders whose pomade can't cover their lack of character, something shared only by real men who have done what they have to in making their way in a hostile world.<br /><br />That said, how does the viewer see Lawless as something with more gravity than backwoods, slack-jawed campiness?  One way is to take Lawless seriously as an allegory for life in the Appalachian U.S.  There, in rural West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Kentucky, the contrast between right and wrong, good and bad, decent and decadent are as clear cut, plain to see, and fraught with peril as in a mainland China forced labor camp.  In a lot of places in our world, subtlety, nuance, shades of gray, and understatement are artificial contrivances that misrepresent rather than clarify.  Contrary to aesthetically mandated conventional wisdom, some stories really do have only one side.  If you're afflicted with a really powerful aversion to this accurately simplified view of much of the world, you won't like Lawless any more than you'd like, say, John Sayles' movie Matewan or the Norwegian film The King of Devil's Island.  You'll find it just too easy to make hard and fast moral judgments.<br /><br />Lawless, however, is not devoid of artful and well-wrought irony.  The good guys are the law breakers, trying to get by in a hard place during the hardest of times.  With or without free booze, the local cops are sympathetic to their mountain-bred brethren and they rein in the worst excesses of their nominal allies sent in from the outside.  The lead character, played by Shia LeBouf, is not the feckless loose cannon that first appearances might lead us to expect him to be.  Jessica Chastain really is looking for peace and quiet, a reprieve from the chaos, grime, and random cruelty of city life.  Tom Hardy's fanciful run in with natural causes proves to be more of a challenge than knives and bullets that draw blood in anger.<br /><br />LeBouf does a good job of maintaining his unlikely clean-cut boyishness throughout the film, but it would be good to know more about him.  Mia Waiskowska inserts a believable streak of independence and a good deal of cultural contrast into her Amish-like character as Lebouf's love interest, though LeBouf's peaceable dinner with her family may be a bit far-fetched.  Tom Hardy is always likable, though he plays his character so low-key that he could serve as a stand-in for Mumbles, one of Hardy's friends in the black comedy Rock'n'Rolla.  Guy Pearce does a superb job as official Hooveresque evil personified.<br /><br />Lawless is by no means a perfect film, but it's a lot of fun with excitement and intensity to spare.  I liked it, and I'll watch it again.  Blood flows freely in this violent world, evoking the dark, violent, and, yes, lawless themes that pervade this part of our planet.ore than you'd like, say, John Sayles' movie Matewan or the Norwegian film The King of Devil's Island.

B00AIUUXHC|4.0|well I have to say this is the best shark game I have ever played (and I have tried a lot of them) though when I was very close to the highest level of shark the game crashed and lost my stats =( I started over none the less.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I did not see the movie but decided to read the book. I was very pleased and I enjoyed the writing style. It had a happy ending without it becoming unrealistic. The main characters were interesting and real, I recommend this book.
B00B2166BS|5.0|While it is strange that I have to buy a third party connector for my Nexus, this works great.  Might as well be the official pogo connector
B0089LOKHG|5.0|Great job with the book. But I didn't like the before I fall at the end of it. Good job though.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love Mahjong and this one is great! HD makes it clearer and the sound on my Kindle makes it really fun!
B008XNZMOU|4.0|I doubt that she will ever top 'Speak Now' but this is a good try. It is like orange juice, sweet and tangy.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|I've always been a fan of everything Tolkien, and I thought Peter Jackson did very well with LOTR.  I was initially skeptical about Hobbit, and if he could actually pull it off as well.  He definitely did that.  There might have been a scene or two I would have clipped out, that reached for the far-fetched; however, I thought it was very well done overall.<br /><br />I really liked the bonus features.  I had not been following the making of the movie, like many other fans - so, the bonus features at the end which was a videography of the film through the the 1st and 2nd movies - has me waiting for the next film's release.  Enjoy!
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I loaded this app on Amazon's free app day. I have played a few times...it is has some similarities to mahjong matching games, except you can win.  I like it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I LOVE this app. I get soooo much interesting material on this site.  UT I do spend sooooo much time on it.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Good movie, needs your full attention. I watched it with my 12yr old and 14yr old sons they really enjoyed it.
B00AC8ZIXO|4.0|I know the movie was done more for the promotion of a video game; but, I thought it was very well done.  For those out there that enjoy a well-done, lower-budget SciFi film - this one rates right up there in my book.  I would also love to see additional movies done with larger budgets.
B0096PYUE2|3.0|a site I was trying to access required a flash player.  I tried this one.  I was never able to get it to work.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|... and always hard to put it down.  If you are a JG fan, you'll appreciate the &#34;non-factual&#34;, yet compelling manner this story is written in.  A good/easy read and sure to not disappoint.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|THE WONDERFUL world of Oz is a great story about sympathy and understanding people. I love how people are all working together to go through obstacles even if they all have differences.
0316228532|1.0|I usually try to finish a book but this was so awful I just gave up.  My time is worth more than reading about boring, obnoxious people that I don't like.
B00AHDXTIK|5.0|As noted by some others, the cable is thicker than the standard Apple cable - but its 3 meters long.<br /><br />The length is very helpful while traveling and an outlet is properly posited near a seat.<br />Cable works just as well as the Apple cable - I have no hesitation in recommending this.  It's my travel cable while jumping around the globe with my iPad mini.
B0041D843M|5.0|Very well written and a valuable tool to help understand why we need to take control of our health. The medical profession needs to actually stand up and take notice.
B0014YVC6W|5.0|this was my boyfriend's favorite movie as a child and i got it for him for our first xmas together.  loved that he was so excited over it.
B005RUV0NY|5.0|I can't wait to watch season 3! This series is addictive. I really like the ease of buying online and instantly viewing on my IOS.
B002GHHHPQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite Gangster movies of ALL times!.Sean Connery plays a great role as a &#34;rough&#34; beat cop. Great stuff
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved it! It took me a while to get into the story but once it got going I didn't want to put it down.  I loved that he used sources who could actually have some insight into what could've happened had Kennedy not been assassinated.  I wish I could say more but I would give it all away!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The Language of Flowers is a unique story, with unique characters.  It breaks your heart and warms it, too.  Learning about the symbolism of flowers was also an added benefit.  The writing style is clear and beautiful.  I loved this book.

B005LAII1C|5.0|the movie was great a lot of fun to watch ,very entertaining definitely worth seeing,alot of laugh,well put together and produced
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Really nice game, flows really.  Like the powerhouse!! The different boards and such couldn't  easier to obtain. Characters are really cool.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Didn't know how I would like it - never saw it publicized when it was in theatres (was it?).  Enjoyed it so much had to watch it again.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|One of many masterpieces written by Riordan. I'm sure more will follow, if you haven't read his past books well it's a must
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Wow! Each level just keeps getting better. Will admit to getting frustrated every now and then when i get backed up, but eventually it gets sorted out. Lovely game that tests your concentration and i.q. skills :)
B009AOFNU4|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1ULQ7SQINUSIJ]]UPDATE:  It looks like the price has reduced a bit.  It was about twice what it's currently at before.<br /><br />This is an excellent little game controller. It's solid, well constructed, and comes with a handy little pouch to transport it in. It is fully iCade compatible so any iOS game that works with the iCade should work with this.  I tested Midway Arcade and Metal Slug 3 and both worked just fine.<br /><br />A few negatives worth noting:<br /><br />1.  It's ridiculously expensive. I'm not sure why it costs so much especially considering you can buy 3 competing joysticks for the price of this one.  Even the legendary [[ASIN:B004YC4NH6 ION iCade Arcade Cabinet for iPad]] is half the price.<br /><br />2.  The controller is tiny so those with large hands should consider that before purchasing.<br /><br />3.  The Mac and PC software is bloated and completely unnecessary.  In fact on my Mac it rendered the controller unusable and my mouse pointer started moving when I touched one of the analog sticks.  The controller is a standard Bluetooth HID device so most software that supports joysticks should pick it up automatically without the bloatware.<br /><br />4.  There are no mounting brackets for phones like other bluetooth controllers have.<br /><br />5.  Did I mention it was expensive?<br /><br />Bottom line?  At this price it's 3.5 stars.. The controller is great but I don't think it's that much better than comparable products.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|I loved the game while i was able to play. Now all it does is lag and I cant play anymore cuz all it does is download content then it kicks me out of the game. I had to uninstall the game!!!
B002ZG9940|4.0|I understand why the reviews of this film, are all over the map.  Its marketing campaign promised some kind of intriguing spy? movie with some action.<br /><br />What the movie delivered was an intriguing (retired)spy movie with almost NO action.  And a man having a middle age crisis-where he is no longer at the top of his game, but not ready for the retirement home.  This movie is about a loner - who becomes lonely, and I found it fascinating- but then I'm a loner. :D<br /><br />If you approach this movie as a Drama - about the corrosive effects of being a loner and the karma of being an assassin on the downslope of life - and you are a fan of Clooney, I think you will really enjoy it!<br /><br />I love how it perfectly captured the terrible feeling of being someplace beautiful, and idyllic- but being unable to enjoy it due to your own demons.  In this case demons being inside his head AND external enemies tryring to find and kill him<br /><br />This isn't a great movie, but if you go in with accurate expectations, I don't think most people will be disappointed.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|This is an excellent game was good controls and graphics.  The author found a good balance between a realistic controls in fun game play.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|A great cast, the perfect actors for their parts, the scene's where it's cold actually make me cold. The little King you love to hate, I don't remember the actors names, the gal with the dragons is great, I'm sorry the part of her husband had to go, I liked him! you have to love the little man in my opinion is the best actor in the cast. I was sorry Sean Bean was written out, that was the main reason I started to watch it and I'm glad I did, maybe he'll come back as a ghost or something, it's all fantasy, who knows! love it!
B004H6G0TI|5.0|Excellent game! I would gladly pay for this game. This game is a ton of fun. Skill level progresses perfectly and the music is pretty awesome.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book is about young love and hard life.  The boy cares for his brother as their  parents die and he meets a girl, but he is her teacher.  It's about their path.
B009AMANBA|4.0|While watching this movie, I felt like I had an inside peek at the Lincolns.  I highly recommend this film.
B005S9EK5Y|1.0|I was all set to watch a good drama movie to see how it would differ from the other two before it, I pictured Russell Crowe playing the bad guy & I knew he would be terrific. Then the singing started, all singing, gave it a 1/2 hour & that was it, nothing about this could keep my attention.<br /><br />I doubt if everyone watches the Academy awards every year or pays attention to every movie made, I don't, does everyone? So those who live in a hole they say, like me, this is a MUSICAL.<br /><br />If you're into drama movie's and not drama musical's this is not for you, better off watching these movies that were made.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003F1JG9M Les Miserables (1998)]]<br />[[ASIN:B002SEV3MA Les Miserables]]
B009IEXKXI|4.0|The premise is exciting... Mars, a mechanically minded nerd with a sense of humor and huge obstacles to overcome. It's fast paced, the first person narrative voice jogs the story with real pace.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I started watching this show late in season 2 and loved it immediately.  I bought both seasons 1 and 2 to catch up on the story.  It is totally captivating.  Can't wait for season 3.
B00APJLX8E|4.0|My fiance and I really enjoyed the movie. It was cute and what you'd expect from a cartoon.<br />Thanks! Have a great day!
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|This may indeed be a composite character, Maya.  Nevertheless, the content of the movie is very compelling.  It touches on many different human elements.  It employs some of the best insights into human cognition.  It is not particularly judgmental of either al Qaeda or the CIA, in that sense it is balanced.  The powers that be wanted this story to be told.  Osama bin Laden was not evil, rather he took calculated risks and was very successful in drawing the United States into an endless war. He was fighting for control of the vast resources of the Middle East and an end to the Arab regimes that collaborate with the West.  Oil has shaped American foreign policy since the end of the the second world war and this whole conflict has had nothing to do with freedom or evil doers not liking our liberty and open society.  It has been about either preserving or changing the status quo.  Ultimately though, his principle objectives have yet to be achieved and they probably will not be fulfilled to his liking. Even though Islamism is pressing for greater influence it is not the final chapter of this region of the world.  Zero Dark Thirty does a very nice job of dissecting and portraying the inherent human qualities of all protagonists in this clash of civilizations.  The children at Osama's compound were just as frightened as any American or European child would have been.  Masterful storytelling.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I never knew there were so many books to the world of Oz and like most books made into movies the book outshines the movie, but the movie will always hold a special place in my heart. I cannot wait to read the others.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|one of my favorite apps on my kindle fire. games are sometimes simple and sometimes challenging. the easier ones help you unlock more coins to keep playing. worth the download! :)
B007THA4FI|4.0|Far cry from Harry Poter, rather crude in parts, but, she is a good storyteller.  Try and keep an open mind while reading
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|While I will frequently be captivated by a few songs the first time I listen to a new album, this must be a first for me:  I immediately designated almost all of these songs to be added separately to my \\"Individual Songs\\" folder containing my favorite music!  (I listen to those songs randomly in my car and often make selections from that folder for listening while I'm on my computer.)  Jon and the band have created another winner!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I found this book was dragging the story too much and many unanswered questions... didn't like the storyline of Arya, Stannis, Asha, Theo and John snow. I was hoping to see something about Sansa and Lady stark...but no mention of them. Tyrion journey was the most dragging part of this story and for what? This book could have gone another way and be magnificent...I'm a little bit disappointed.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|The story of this sniper is engrossing and captivating throughout most of the book. For the fan of true military stories of our warriors it is great. I must admit, I was often tired of reading expletives which added nothing to the story.  It was his words, so it does keep the story line real so to speak.
0345803485|1.0|I gave this book a one because it reads like fan-fiction, which, yes, I realize it was originally.  But it was painfully apparent that Christian was Edward and Ana was Bella, even without the piano playing and lip biting.<br /><br />Erotica, especially bondage erotica, is a bold field to write in, but I feel that EL James with 50 shades went the way of Rachilde when she wrote &#34;Monsieur Venus&#34; and was trying to write a novel that would shock and titillate the masses, being a controversy piece more than a solid story.<br /><br />The thing that bothered me the most about the eroticism of the book was the sex scenes.  As a fan of bondage and roleplaying in my life, I was expecting something that was far more stunning, but was let down flat by even the first &#34;vanilla&#34; scene when he takes her virginity. It is described as &#34;a weird pinching sensation&#34; after he slams into her all at once.  I'm sorry, but any real woman who lost her virginity like that would be crying on the ground, not begging for more.<br /><br />Christian Grey and Edward Cullen are the same character in that they wish to dominate their innocent partners, and just like Bella, Ana goes along with it.  She expresses being irritated by his domineering ways, but feels herself drawn to wanting to &#34;fix&#34; this irreparably broken man whose fantasies of control reach beyond the bedroom into her everyday life.  She describes him as a stalker and rightfully so after he traces her cell phone and buys her a phone so that he can know where she is every hour of every day.  And don't even get me started on his irrational jealousy.<br /><br />No self-respecting woman should want to be treated the way that Christian treats Ana or Edward treats Bella, because these men find their respective romantic partners nothing more than interesting oddities that they wish to study, so they set up damaging relationships in which they isolate the woman from friends and family with romantic or sexual gestures.  Both are textbook examples of an abusive relationship.<br /><br />I would not recommend this trash to anyone who ever wants a healthy relationship ever again.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|JT proves he still has it on this album and he takes his usual neo-70's soul sound to the next level.  At times sounding like Marvin Gaye or Parliament Funkadelic... this album is awesome.  Let's hope the rumored second half scheduled of November is as good!
0817439390|4.0|I own several of Bryan Peterson's books on photography, and generally adore his approach because he's explains fundamental concepts in plain language. Others have provided excellent summaries of Understanding Exposure, so I won't repeat those here.<br /><br />I'm only rating this four stars because much of the content is redundant with some of the author's other books. If you haven't read his other books, then Understanding Exposure is probably just shy of five-star worthy. But if you own his other books--notably, [[ASIN:0817432256 Bryan Peterson's Understanding Photography Field Guide]] and [[ASIN:0770433073 Bryan Peterson's Understanding Composition Field Guide]]--this will only be of minimal value: about 80% of Understanding Exposure is explored in these two subsequent books in far greater depth and detail. Don't misunderstand; there is some content in Understanding Exposure that's unique to this book and can't be found in Peterson's other books. My point is, if you own the author's other books, manage your expectations about what you'll get out of this book.<br /><br />So if you're torn between getting Understanding Exposure and one of Peterson's other books, which should you get? My personal preference and recommendation is to start with [[ASIN:0817432256 Understanding Photography]]; it's better organized and more comprehensive. [[ASIN:0770433073 Understanding Composition]] is a close second--again, because it's more comprehensive, and better organized. (Clearly, the author's ability to articulate his thoughts clearly and completely has improved with time, as both were written many years after the first edition of Understanding Exposure!) Only then, for the more serious student of photography, would I recommend Understanding Exposure. Then again, these are just my personal preferences. If you have a chance to flip through these books at your local bookstore or photography store before ordering, do so, and decide for yourself.

1742200206|4.0|I grew up within sight of NYC. My family didn't own a car but we were only one bus (or ferry ride) into the Big Apple so we shopped, went to museums, enjoyed movies and tucked into great ethnic food from Chinatown to Coney Island. For that reason, it takes a lot for a local guide book to impress me. My basic ruler is simple - the guide book must touch all of the high points - lure the reader to the must-see sights, the big museums, identify the key landmarks and clearly outline walking tours to the significant neighborhoods. This Lonely Planet guide hits these perfectly with the opening section full of well written teasers called the top 16. It starts with the \\"big dog\\" - Central Park, takes the reader to the iconic skyscrapers of mid-town, explains the live theater offerings including Broadway and the lure of the equally fascinating off-Broadway and off-off-Broadway, temps the taste buds with the City's many ethnic eating possibilities and continues through museums, shopping, sports, walking tours, Brooklyn, Queens, Jazz, late night entertainment and Times Square. Each topic ends with the page reference number for quick access on the road or in-hotel planning. Quick, clever and helpful.<br /><br />Inside each section, they start with a map, some local facts, a list of top things to do and see, how to get there by subway or bus, recommended eating and drinking establishments and even recommended shopping. I delved deeply into the Greenwich Village and Chelsea section - two of my favorite of the micro neighborhoods in NYC. They listed in the \\"best\\" one of my favorite eateries - Tartine and two of the best book stores in the City - The Strand and Three Lives & Company, so paraphrasing Bill Murray  in Caddyshack - they got that going for them, which is nice... The walking tours they offer hit the historic spots but also touche on (albeit dated) pop culture with references to the TV shows Sex and the City and Friends.<br /><br />Their food suggestions have some of the always reliable restaurants that I personally like - Otto, Gotham Bar & Grill and Tartine. Lonely Planet's writers also found a few I have not tried but will soon based on their suggestions - REDFARM and Joe's Pizza seem like musts.  Their shopping suggestions also show strong local knowledge - from MXYPLYZYK, to Forbidden Planet - Flight 001 to Bucker - Murray's Cheese to McNulty's and Pleasure Chest to Destination. So many stores, so little time,. That means having a local sneak you the 411 makes the life of the short-time visitor more productive.<br /><br />All in all, the Lonely Planet guide to NYC is a good resource for the vacationer and even for the seasoned local. It is a little hipper than the typical guide book with well researched advice, suggestions and insights. It also dares to send the reader on virtual trips outside the confines of Manhattan to far flung Queens, Brooklyn and even upstate.<br /><br />If you are young or young at heart and want to engage in armchair travel or need a smart, hip travel companion, you would be hard pressed to find a better resource than this new edition.<br /><br />Recommended.lways reliable restaurants that I personally like - Otto, Gotham Bar & Grill and Tartine.

B006MW3V6U|4.0|The acting is solid and the cinematography is excellent. It makes learning the history of the times fun. The plot lines are getting a bit soapy though. If they don't tone that down next season they will turn off some viewers (like me).

B005IQZB14|4.0|This is an amazing story well told. Wondered about her last of training and sometimes forethought, but impressed at her persistence.<br />dlooo
B004LWZW42|5.0|Here's the nutshell. This movie has me thinking about it weeks after viewing it. It is my least favorite (I didn't see the Wolverine solo), but I still thought it had good acting and special effects. It also had some themes as did the Trilogy -- this one focused on self-acceptance.<br /><br />Spoilers are below. The reasons this is my least favorite don't take away from the quality of the movie, but they are specific things I didn't like. One thing is that this movie had a \\"to be continued\\" type ending -- a clear indicator there will be more movies to follow. The trilogy had more definite/satisfying endings, even the second one where you had a hunch that Jean Grey wasn't gone for good. I also found it interesting that there were defectors from the good (non-violent) side to the bad (violent), and none the other way around.  I love a good redemption plot! Then, there is the use of the F-word for laughs, and the movie is more risque than I like (which isn't new for the X-Men movies).<br /><br />Aside from that, I found this an interesting origin episode. Kevin Bacon did great as the villain. It's tough to develop all the characters, and so one can excuse its lack of consistency.<br /><br />No, this isn't Oscar caliber. But it is an enjoyable use of two plus hours.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|The revelation of the true &#34;language of flowers&#34;, a Victorian method of sending discreet messages to another by the type of flowers selected is intriging.  This messaging system is integrated into the very complex story line of relationships and results in an instructive and unusual means of development.  There were a few incidences of over worked aspects of the story, but the inevitable insertion of flowers and their meanings saved these stretches from an early rejection.  I have recommended this book to other friends.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I didn't start watching the show when it first came out. I tried watching an episode but it wasn't very good. Recently I bought and watched all three seasons...I'm so glad I did!! The episode I watched and didn't like happened to be the one dud of the entire series. It's a great show. You never know what to expect. You fall in love with the characters. I'm going to have a hard time waiting a week for the next episode rather than just watching the next one on my Kindle :)
B00499QUK2|5.0|My daughter and  I are really enjoying Sherlock.  I'm a Holmes fan from way back, but the writers have done a tremendous job of updating the storyline to the 21st century.
0374203032|4.0|Michael Sandel is a smart man whose often seemingly simple insights cut into some of the most pressing issues of, well, I was about to say \\"modern life\\", but actually, just life.  I particularly very highly recommend his book \\"Justice\\" which should be required reading for every undergraduate as they'd certainly get more from than than from, say, reading Plato or Machiavelli in their original forms, but I digress.<br /><br />This book, \\"what money can't buy\\" addresses an issue that has deep immediate pertinence to America in particular.  Specifically, it discusses why market-based solutions, so popular as quick fixes for any number of policy and regulatory issues these days, should be carefully considered.  Specifically, market based solutions often (to paraphrase Sandel) change the underlying dynamic of the good or service being transacted.  This is a subtle and critically important point, and the book is an easy enough read that you should get it from Sandel rather than trying to gloss it from my or other reviewers' synopsis (so I won't get into it in detail).<br /><br />Sandel basically goes from example to example to illustrate this.  As he progresses through the examples, he makes only the lightest reference to theory to structure his argument.  I kind of suspect that an unwise editor told him to be light on the theory and just stick to examples to entertain the freakonomics-reading demographic.  this is a pity, since while the examples are mostly thoughtfully constructed, as Sandel doesnt really, for example, make a taxonomy of problem types and the applicability of his thoughts to them, at its worst the book occasionally reads like \\"old man yelling and clouds and complaining that a root beer no longer costs a nickel.\\"  Or, to put it another way, while it's all there, it's not convincingly enough written that you or I could give the book to one of those bozos who screams \\"socialism!\\" every time, say, the topic of public libraries is raised.  there are too many objections, even if simpleminded ones, that might come from such people to this book, and unfortunately sandel doesn't tackle objections head-on.<br /><br />I have lived outside of the USA for quite a while now (note to amazon: it's a bit annoying that I am not a 'verified purchase' as I bought it on Amazon.UK).  This has afforded me both a comparative and external vantage point to what is happening in the USA and indeed, the externalities that Sandel refers to are indeed in my view torpedoing the country.  It's gotten to the point where american consumers even implicitly demand marketization of their daily life--american restaurants both upmarket and not no longer serve \\"a hamburger.\\"  Instead, consumers demand \\"wagyu beef with heirloom tomatoes on an artisinal..\\" admittedly I don't know the BS marketing jargon and products, but it's very, very sad.<br /><br />I do recommend this book, but honestly, much more could have been possible.  I give it 4 not 3 stars, howver, due to reviewer's tilt and because I want people to read this book, even if it is flawed.objections, even if simpleminded ones, that might come from such people to this book, and unfortunately sandel doesn't tackle objections head-on.<br /><br />I have lived outside of the USA for quite a while now (note to amazon: it's a bit annoying that I am not a 'verified purchase' as I bought it on Amazon.UK).

B00563M11M|5.0|It's amazing how Pratchett manages to combine very serious themes with laugh-out-loud-humour. Vimes and the other well known charachters continue to grow and show new sides.
B00B780TAK|5.0|I was so happy when they had a season 3  - This is one of my favorite shows of all time  -it is well written !  the story is about really well done  -classy  -  this is one the best cast -- they are all intertwining each other  -People live get married have babies  and die  --  wonderfully done  - this is intelligent nice for your brain  ---beautiful to your eyes  --  I can't wait until next season
B007SYWFRM|2.0|Game started out being fun and addicting.  Since the latest update it works horribly.  The game responds very slow and is continuously reloading.  Contacted tech support more than once with no remedy yet and no apparent hope of future help or contacts.  Don't start the game unless it won't bother you to be disappointed after you have put in a lot of effort.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|My 5 year old loves these movies, it's not like the Bratz. I think their personality and attitude is better for my daughter.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|I don't know what my expectation was, if any, with this movie, but it was easy to cast one's mind into the great blue sea and live out the crests and valley's of Pi's life along with the character as he faced all odds . . . as we all do in life . . .  to survive. Totally worth the watch.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|As always, I've been blown away by Lauren Oliver's writing. Her writing is flawless and the pace is so pleasant to read. I don't know many authors that can write the way she can, somehow everything sounds so truthful and moving.With Requiem is no different. certainly a worthy conclusion to one of my favorite YA series.<br /><br />So much is happening in Requiem, finally everything should come together. I liked the alternate perspective between Lena and Hana, we not only get to experience what is happening in Lena's hometown but also what Lena and the other Invalids have to go through. Everything comes nicely together in the end, even though it is an open ending. It was such a fitting idea for this series because in the end, Oliver is giving us the chance to decide for ourselves. I have no words for this novel, it is that simple. The love triangle is so realistically-written and not only that but also anything else in this novel, the bad and the good things are relatable.<br /><br />What makes this series so special is that you can identify yourself easily with any of Oliver's characters. I like each and every one of them. Lena became a strong character, so easily discernible from the character she was in Delirium. Hana is a different character, as well, but is it that bad? Even Lena has to ask herself sometimes if the procedure is such a bad thing. Finally love can become a disease but sometimes it is just worth the risk.<br /><br />All in all, Requiem is a fantastic conclusion to one of my favorite series, ever. I'm a huge fan of Lauren Oliver and all of my expectations were met in Requiem. Certainly some will be mad, sad and even desperate with this ending, but I, for one, was happy with the way things ended. It was a very satisfying conclusion and as always, you will be taken into a rollercoaster ride of different emotions. I cannot wait for Lauren Oliver to write more unbelievably unique novels, which I will most certainly read.
B00000D9TQ|4.0|Phil's amazing!  I've always liked his music. All fans will like this collection. Enjoy Phil Collins...Hits!  Phil Collins music rules!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved these books. It was so nice to have a dystopian/post apocalypse that had adults as the main characters instead of teens. I stayed up late three nights in a row to finish this book and wasn't disappointed in the ending. The author Hugh Howey completes the story well, so that if this is the end then I guess I can live with it. But I have high hopes that the story will continue and we will find out more about some characters  introduced toward the end of the book. If you love these types of books I highly recommend this one, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />I am editing this review because after a bit of research I found that the author has already added several more books to the series. I have already purchased the next in the series \\"First Shift\\" and am excited to have more to read tomorrow.
B002APU580|5.0|This movie gets me every time.  I love it.  It is my favorite &#34;watch in the middle of the day while snuggling in bed&#34; movie.

1582701709|5.0|The Secret is one of the Best books I have read. After I read this book I felt like I could be or do anything I wanted. I have really been monitoring my thoughts so as to not be so negative and I have definitely seen some changes,not huge changes but changes none the less.I have been this way my whole entire life. In my opinion I knew I was probably one of the most negative persons around and most of my family thought so too.It's very hard to change something you have been conditioned to doing so many years. I'm 62 years old by the way. I can remember as a young child never really being happy,not knowing exactly why and for sure never knew how to change that feeling. I have now really been paying more attention to what I'm thinking and feeling which has definitely helped me, thanks to \\"The Secret\\". I wake up every morning now and look at my vision board and get excited. I'm currently living with my son and his family because I have nowhere else to go and I've been taking care of my 3 yr. old Granddaughter since she was born. I had no idea what I was going to do once my babysitting job was done here because I couldn't make it on just my Social Security alone. I now have a new lease on life and can't wait to see what happens on down the road because I now know I can do this. Thanks Rhonda for my new transformation.

READ THIS BOOK<br />Have fun realizing reality!!
B000FA5SMK|5.0|Who doesn't like a story about pirate's treasure? Corey at his wise cracking, self centered, egotistical self solving mysteries and crimes. Never any rest for those that can. Good characters, good plot with some twists and turns.
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|Once called \\"the Michael Jordan of the guitar\\" by Entertainment Weekly (who now refuses to acknowledge his existence), Richard Thompson continues to compose, play, and sing at the highest levels. \\"Electric\\" is filled with the soaring guitar magic his fans have come to expect. Like most Thompson albums, this one requires a few listens to fully appreciate the nuances of his unique playing style his unusual voice and his tendency towards thematic darkness in composition. Once you get there, though, \\"Electric\\" is powerful stuff. Sorry, couldn't resist one pun.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|My little girls love playing with the horse. There are lots of little things that they can do but some of the games are for older kids.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|The game is very easy to learn, but challenging enough to keep you occupied. The game is visually pleasing with all the colors, and the music is very atmospheric. The combination aides in a feeling of immersion and will make you lose track of time, which is great because I only use games in short random intervals (such as waiting rooms, bus stops, etc.)
B006TF6WAM|4.0|A charming tale of two people who on reflecting on their responses to life's challenges come to a clearer and more honest understanding of themselves as individuals. The main character, Harold  was rather frustrating at times as he appeared to make rash and unreasonable decisions but redeems himself by becoming stronger as he progresses in his journey. Maureen, his wife, at first a cold and pale character gains our respect as we learn how her life experiences transformationed her from the vivacious and happy person she was when first married. We see her confront  her present life and its failings, gain in  strength and become a rational and loving support for Harold.

I'll probably even watch it again, because the acting and storyline was very believable, and I want to see if there are clues to why it's left so opened ended hanging.

B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is really fun and challenging at the same time. I really like the different ways you are able to play.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|This is an amazing movie that is meant for kids of all ages, from 1-99. I loved it so much I recommended it to mother and she loved it as well. It's not just a great movie for the entertainment aspect of it, but it also has so many great messages that people can take away from it. I definitely recommend it to all my friends and I recommend it to you.
B0094K1JPC|5.0|Harrison Ford played his role well, and having been in the broadcast TV business for several years, the movie accurately demonstrated the egos and competition in television.
1935251740|5.0|Biocentrism by Robert Lanza and Bob Berman is truly an unexpected journey into the aspects of reality above time and beyond space; a scientific approach to why we CANNOT die that is a must read for anyone who fears death or has been indoctrinated by the reductionists. This easy to read text explains quantum  physics in simple language then mixes it with biocentrism to weave the story of the entire universe in terms of consciousness and observation. As complocated as this may sound, Lanza and Berman have the knack of penning their work in ways that are simply darn enjoyable to read and absolutely informative. It's a make-you-think-and-feel experience that can change your enire view of life after life.
1846070635|3.0|I'll be honest here, I bought this audio book simply because I seen it was read by David Tennant and it was Doctor Who. I mean, it's pretty impossible not to like anything that involves those two, am I right? I've read TV-to-Book's before when I was younger, so I had an idea of what I was getting into. If you're expecting extensive character development, don't look here.<br /><br />BUT, if you're like me, and looking for something entertaining to listen to on your way to work, then go for it! David's voices of Rose and Mickey were spot on. It was like \\"watching\\" a Doctor Who episode right in my car. The plot was interesting and kept up with the usual plots of the TV series, which I really loved.  And you don't have to read the other books in the series before this one. I just happened to stumble across it and bought it, without having read any previous ones. The only thing is, if you haven't watched Doctor Who before, don't bother with this audio book. You'll be completely lost!

0062014536|4.0|I'm not even sure where to begin. I think I'm still in shock that it's actually over. I don't know how to feel! I'm lost, confused, and yes, slightly upset? Maybe? I'm not sure.<br /><br />I was absolutely DYING when I finished Delirium and Pandemonium because the cliff hangers were just too much for me (but in a good way). But with Requiem I find myself still flipping the pages for more.<br /><br />Okay, let's get one thing straight before I go into this: I freaking LOVE Lauren Oliver. I do. Her writing is breathtaking and beautiful and will suck anyone into the story. And I LIKED Requiem. Really, I did. The only thing was though... I didn't fall in love with it. Oh, I tried. I really did. But by the time I flipped the last page I felt myself saying \\"No, please. Don't let it end like this. There has to be MORE.\\"<br /><br />So here's my brief (and NON SPOILERY) problems with it:<br /><br />1. It's told from Lena AND Hana's POV. Honestly, I think the story would have been better for me had I just had Lena's story. Sometimes switching up POV is a good thing by the third novel. But with Requiem I just found myself saying \\"Okay, okay. Hana. Shut-up. I want to get back to Lena now.\\" Not that Hana's story wasn't interesting... but I think it would have been better as a short story.<br /><br />2. There's no closure. When I read what is presumably the last and final book of a trilogy, I want some freaking closure! However, it's really rare that I actually get this. I loved the last page of this novel- it was insightful, beautiful, and personal. But I still felt like there were questions, very important questions, that were left up in the air.<br /><br />3. It felt rushed. There is a lot going on in Requiem, and I felt like some of that was lost on me because the story didn't go as in depth as the previous books. Especially since we we're getting two different, but coinciding, stories.<br /><br />Is that to say you will totally be disappointed in Requiem? No way! Despite my issues, I thought it was a great story! I loved the action and I loved how the war between the cureds and invalids has been amped up. And, like I said, Lauren Oliver is an amazing writer. She really makes you feel like you are part of the story. It is definitely an amazing trilogy and I will be recommending it to anyone I come across!issues, I thought it was a great story!

B005LAII12|1.0|The movie was OK if it didn't freeze. Once it started playing, it started freezing like crazy - really couldn't watch the movie because of that reason.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS APP IS TOTALLY WORTH THE PRICE. THE PC IS BETTER THAN THIS VERSION BUT STILL IT ROCKS!! BUY THIS APP now!!!! 0.0.  (:  ;)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|omg I love this!!!  this is better than the first version and it has minecarts and everything!  just install it!
B008TRUDAS|4.0|With everything going on in my life right now, it's really been a challenge for me to find time for reading, but somehow, I ended up reading this book in one sitting. I feel like there's something magical that happens when you find one of THOSE books- you know, the really amazing kind that you just have to tell somebody about. I am convinced a time portal opens up just for those books so you can finish them in no time. \\"Slammed\\" just happens to be one of those.<br /><br />I laughed, I cried, and then I sobbed. Colleen Hoover does an AMAZING job by giving her readers \\"the feels\\" and sucking them into Lake and Will's world. The characters, the plot, the poetry, the chemistry... all of it was just... wow. It left me speechless.<br /><br />Not to mention, THE AVETT BROTHERS!!!! Seriously. If you have never listened to these guys, go. Go right now and check them out. Because their the inspiration for this novel. I love how their  music is incorporated and weaved throughout the story. It makes it that much better.<br /><br />So what are you waiting for?! Go grab you a box of tissues and curl up in bed with Will Slammed!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Our family sat and watched together, all enjoyed this story and the art work was breathtaking!  Thank you. It was my gift to them.
B004ZG5F3M|5.0|One of my favorite movies of Johnny Depp. Just can't get enough! Looking forward to purchasing more of his movies for my &#34;Library.&#34;
B000QY9WOU|2.0|However, if she had been on American Idol, they would have said she way overdid the production at the expense of the singing. Goodbye Cher.
1567184855|5.0|I have implored everyone I know to read this book.  It makes death fearless, encourages us about what happens to our loved ones who disappear from view but evidently have a humane and interesting afterlife.  It fleshes out that between-lives time which I and others have certainly been pantingly curious about.  This and Destiny of Souls are a must-read.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This is just like the Mario brothers. I had to get this game. I've been waiting for something like it and now its hear.
1449325947|5.0|I've looked at several books on CSS and, thanks to Amazon's previewing feature, I chose this book.  I'm very impressed with how well it explains the rather geeky material so it can be understood, and there are plenty of chances to tinker with the code yourself as he walks you through it step-by-step.  I highly recommend this book!
B0096Y7STM|5.0|Not to much to say other than when I seen that Nero did o e of the remixes I was ecstatic Nero and mj =perfection plus you can never go wrong with an mj album he is the king
B003M6EAXM|4.0|Watched all of the seasons again.  Always a show with never ending twists..  Sad to see this as the last season.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great series!  Comedy, drama and history, all in one!  We love the characters and the actors do a great job.
B005PK56TA|4.0|American Horror Story is not what I expect in a &#34;horror story.&#34; I expect to be somewhat scared by a horror show and I wasn't even slightly tense while watching this series. The lack of scare is why I gave it 4 stars.<br /><br />The series plot, a house haunted by those who died in it and their manipulation of its residents, is depicted in a way that leaves you wanting to see more. I found the interaction between the residents and ghosts interesting. The ghosts can make themselves visible to the houses residents if they so desire. Their visibility leaves the residents thinking that the ghosts are humans; not the apparitions of troubled souls.<br /><br />I enjoyed watching season 1 through Amazon's instant video app and I look forward to watching season 2.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I found this book by Tina Fey a delight and very amusing.  However, one should be a fan of Saturday Night Live and 30 Rock to get the most out what she has to say about her involvement in these television programs.  Much of the book is dedicated to this subject.  Since I'm not a fan of either of these two shows, I became bored with her involvement and infatuation with Alec Baldwin, whom she mentioned at least 3 dozen times in one context or another.  Her thoughts on her upbringing and married life with child, were hugely amusing and 'laugh out loud' funny.  Her writing occasionally goes all over the place, and I found myself reading the same paragraph twice just to catch her play on words.  In summation, it's a great book (especially for ladies) and I recommend it.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I love the show.  I liked the first two seasons more, but I am still a fan.  Look forward to watching each week.
B000M53GM2|5.0|This is a GREAT movie! It has stood the test of time very nicely. It very well may be Pierce Brosnan's best movie playing 007! If you haven't seen it, you need too. If you are already a Bond fan, you have got to have this movie for your collection. Yes, It's that good! Definitely one of my favorites!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is great for anyone who loves horses, and lets you care for them, enter competitions, and take pictures or your horse.
B00B7ERH04|4.0|So far it all works, but I am not ready to add another star yet... a couple of weeks will be looking again.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|smart, whitty, intelligernt, funny, entertaining - but unfortunately a bit too liberal for my taste... Still my favorite show ever
B000000W5N|5.0|The best Stones album of all time!! Every rock music fan needs this album for their collection! I know it's only rock 'n roll - but I LOVE it!!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I've loved Game of Thrones since I started watching the first season on HBO. Then, I was telling my parents about it and my enthusiasm made them want to watch it too. I got them the first season for Christmas and then was able to get them this one in February. Now they're all caught up and ready for Season 3 to start here at the end of March. The best part is, now they know what the heck I'm talking about. It's great!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|These guys are hero's and stud's of the highest order, and I am glad that they are on my side. It is rare these days in America to find anyone that is truly committed to something that is bigger than they are. When I was reading this I read a little out loud to my wife and she was so sucked in by the drama, she had me read several chapters to her out loud. This is nail biting drama that takes you on an emotional roller coaster. This is a great book, written about truly unique and inspiring men. God bless our service men and women and those bad asses that make up the Navy Seals.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|OMG! I'm addicted to the game. It's really good and has awesome features, I can't believe how awesome the graphics are!! :). SUPPER BIG SMILEY FACE
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|The Blue-ray is simply amazing.  Watching this in a 7.2 surround sound system will leave you feeling like you were there in the hall with the band.  Oh and of course it doesn't hurt that EVERY song in here is just amazing.  If you are a Killers fan you owe it to yourself to watch this on blue-ray... DVD doesn't do it enough justice.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|amazing, it really was i loved it kept my family in touch with each other. evernote is amazing it really is
B007GE2H3G|5.0|Imagine the story you read in childhood becoming an hd movie. It is so real. And great. Exactly the same as story. With great characters, music, ....etc. I wish they do so to the redt of tintin sereis in hd.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Awesome game! Feels retro but plays even better. Won't be putting this one down for a long time. Wide variety of levels.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This is simply one of the best movies that involves video games.  If you were born in the 80's or simply enjoy video games you owe it to yourself to see this movie.  Oh, kids will enjoy this movie also, but in all honesty because of all of the cameos in this movie adults will enjoy it that much more.<br /><br />One thing that I found very light in this Blue-ray were the extras... To be fair with a movie in this genre I was expecting Scott Pilgrim type levels, which is a bit unfair, however that's how much more of this movie I wanted.<br /><br />Also this Blue-ray includes the Paper Man short which is by all account awesome it's self.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun to play. great for kids. Need a way where you can earn more things.love the dog. need a different dog choice
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Nothing like reliving my youth with the sound and picture so much better than the original.  Yes, the special effects are cheesy by today's standards. Yes, Shatner over acts. Three cheers for the genesis of it all!
B005FISBTO|5.0|Nobody serves up misguided justice better than Dexter. Michael Hall is perfect for this part. Have collected the entire series.
B00001OH1S|5.0|The soundtrack is more of the same however it does have a unique version of Sinner Man that made it worth while for me.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love all of the vehicles that you can get.  And I love games where you try to get as far as you can without dying.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Nothing like seeing the movies again in the best HD available.  Sharp images and great sound make the experience new again.
078324228X|5.0|I love this film, Denzel is perfect for the role. I feel this film is a good one to make younger generations watch and be thankful for what good people can accomplish against odds and bad people.
B0091REZMW|5.0|very fun game that's very smooth and easy to play at any time. I love this game and everything about it
B004RJMUJO|3.0|It's an awesome game.  It's not my best favorite, but it's good.  I would make the goals a little bit easier.
B00AATFJK2|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies, excited to see it all again in the best format.  Yul Brenner the best bad guy ever!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is pretty good!  Enjoyed from cover to cover.  Now time to read the rest of the series.  Good writing,!
B0010358D0|5.0|Appleseed Ex Machina is a very enjoyable movie. It is action - packed, keeping you on the edge of your seat. The romance element of the DVD also adds to the flavor of this meaningful drama.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is the best Angry Birds EVER!  The regular bird actually does something besides hit stuff and barely do anything!  And it's Star Wars.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is SO awesome and fun and the huge monkey freaks me out!!! I love the new features and the mine ( if you get that far ) is a cool touch. If u loved temple run u will love this.
B003XFU6WG|5.0|Under rated - this is a great movie with great acting.  It is a chick flick.  I really enjoyed the movie.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|this is the coolest game ever and I like that the inspector is fat and the cool upgrades this is so awesome can you please get it on . iPod it keeps saying it requires ios but I can play it with this mindless thanks
B0063IH60K|3.0|So far it is ok. I usually play this on my computer so it is nice to have it on my Kindle.
0062082353|5.0|I just finished reading &#34;American Sniper.&#34; It is amazing how much Chris (and Taya) sacrificed for their love of country, and the saddest thing was that he had just found a way to help returning soldiers. Chris had found a way to turn his talent and fame into something good, to heal the wounds of war... R.I.P.
B009CF3MEK|5.0|Robert Redford at his finest! Great movie! I had read the book before and watching the movie was such a treat! This is a movie that you don't mind watching twice.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game to pass the time nice graphic real fun non stop not hard not easy 5 stars as good as the first one and better! I have it on all my devices
B00A757EFW|3.0|It is ok to play but maybe not as good as the arcade machine.  I am still getting used to the touch screen though.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Look no further, it allows you to set tunes, music and sound as various alarms. I've been very happy with this app and use it as my main alarm!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Highly recommend! All the seasons are great! Season 3 stands out with A+ performance from Andrew Lincoln in Killer within.
B005MHI0QM|5.0|About the fourth time I have read this extraordinary account of this child living in hiding from the Nazis during.the war.  Remarkable insight and character.  Brilliant child who understood the Jews plight, maintaining a positive attitude despite her ordeal.  Will read it again.  How I wish I could have known her.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This is a new area for me so I haven't used it very much yet.  I need lots of tutoring.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|This new Justin Timberlake cd named \\" THE 20/20 EXPERIENCE\\" is great! It has something for everyone.Each song is better than the first.With each track, He gives you a new and fresh sound that has been needed for some time now as music today now is stale and unappealing.I praise Mr. Timberlake for his vastly different sound to this remarkable masterpiece and I look forward to \\"THE 20/20 EXPERIENCE- PART 2\\"
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Not your typical soap opera!  This one is more mature, intelligent, and realistic with so many characters that are exceptionally well-realized.  No other tv show can deftly manage dozens of characters' stories and give each one equal weight and importance.  Each character's story is memorable and intriguing, and the way they all relate to each other is TV at its best.  And of course, the acting is superb (especially Maggie Smith).  Check it out!
B00B1E6FF8|4.0|I enjoyed the film in the theater and it was a fine experience at home as well.  I was somewhat disappointed that there was no commentary on the DVD as had enjoyed Bigelow's commentary on the DVD of &#34;Hurt Locker.&#34;
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|The graphics are amazing!  It's a great game so far and I've only just started. If you enjoy a good mystery this is a game that gives it to you.
B008JFUTUY|5.0|Once in a lifetime story is beautifully told here, and treats us to one of the most humble and beautiful people to ever grace the music business. This blew my mind. I watched it, watched it again with commentary, then watched all the extras. Brilliant and uplifting!
B000FA5SMK|4.0|John Corey is a great character. He's smart, but he's very good at playing dumb. He has a great sense of humor and I laughed out loud (so embarrassing) several times while reading Plum Island. John's also very annoying. I didn't really appreciate his attitude towards women, but it meshed very well with the rest of John Corey's personality.<br /><br />The plot was quite good and supporting characters were very well done.<br /><br />There was one area of the book that I felt dragged on too long; however, it was necessary to understand later actions. It conisted of several chapters that basically described, through dialogue, the security procedures and biocontainment procedures on Plum Island. I feel this could have been covered in 40 pages versus the 100 or so pages dedicated to these descriptions. This is the reason for a 4-star rating instead of five.<br /><br />Plum Island is the first in the John Corey series. I did enjoy it and have acquired the second in the series. There was a lot of action and the reason for the murders was not what I first expected. There were some surprises and the reading was easy, aside from the part of the book described above.<br /><br />I recommend Plum Island. I like Mr. Demille's writing style and will read more of his work.<br /><br />Advisory - Coarse language, sexual situations, and violence.<br /><br />I borrowed Plum Island from The Wichita Public Library.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|My wife and I both enjoy the great visuals and engaging narration shown in this series.  We also have a two and three year old that both request that we watch these movies at night.  The images are stunning and these are definitely worth buying on Blu-ray.
B0043VDIAG|5.0|I loved this book and it was so compelling that I had many a late night because I didn't want to put it down I would recomend it to everyone as a great suspense story and a strong love story as well
B009MFKO3M|4.0|Forget the obvious influences, forget that we've all seen this movie before.  This is high quality psych and Lonerism is a great album.  Some knob twiddling and electronic flourishes update this well worn sound a bit. A bit. The point is, if you like something don't you usually want more?
B008GXHOFW|5.0|My boy loves this game . Reccomend for any spider man fans . Hope this helps. My son is five years old
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is a beautiful true story. I actually heard of it when I was 14. I'm 26 now. I greatly fell in love with the story and since then always wanted an Akita. I have never seen this movie but I love animals and greatly enjoy animal movies, and the reviews were positive so I bought. Within seven minutes into this movie I already was crying. By the time this movie was over I was a complete mess. I have never cried this much ever. I am not an emotional person so this movie got to me. The last seven minutes of the movie, my cat Logan, (who never likes to cuddle or be smothered with love, unless its on his own terms), actually let me hold his paw and cry the entire time. This movie is so powerful. You need to have a box of kleenex on hand because this movie is incredibly powerful. It breaks your heart how he stays there waiting. My dad has an outdoor cat in his neighborhood that everyone lends a hand and takes care of, feeding him, letting him stay inside their house, etc, but he will never just stay in one place or be an inside cat. He wants out. So I can understand Hachi needing to  leave his home and be there waiting at the train station. Even Richard Gere stated that when he read the script he kept crying and was a mess. If you love animals dearly and enjoy the unconditional love they give you, watch this movie. I'm so glad I have this movie in my collection.
B008UCDDQS|5.0|This tis undoutably one of the best martial arts movies ever made.  It shows the master Bruce Lee in action.  It shows how he kept his moves simple and direct.  It also shows his skills with weapons and his physical conditioning.  The other stars are very good as well.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|I worked in restaurants for years....that was the main reason I went back to college to be a teacher.  The chapter that described the dinner rush in detail made me almost ill.  It is the high pressure of the moment that could not be done well with...lack of sleep...hangover...illness, etc.  It was hell and such high pressure.  Every word that he uses to describe the inner workings of a restaurant are true at some time in that store.  I loved Anthony's book.  I don't choose that lifestyle now but it was fun while it lasted.
B00BIQU1K4|5.0|If you like modern prog you will love this.guitar sax riffs are amazing.song concepts are eerie. Steven Wilson has done it again.go see him live.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|At first the back and forth was difficult for me, but it was a compelling story.  I would recommend this book to mystery lovers.
B0095P33IW|5.0|I really enjoyed the way the whole Captain America story is told and the enteraction between the Captain and the Red Skull.  Great movie.
B004S5FW1U|5.0|'Silver Linings Playbook' is written with such a moving honesty that I couldn't help but relate to all the characters. Quirky and beautiful, it is a fantastic read.
B000P0J0AQ|5.0|trying to re order DVDs stolen during a breakin in texas  happy to find this one<br />I moved to Arkansas to a safer place
B008VBYN80|4.0|The game is fun but you have to add friends to advance which can be tricky to figure out if you are not on Facebook
B00BHU9BV6|5.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this movie.  It is a deep story that I have read in book form, the film did not disappoint!
B00BESLHEA|1.0|Being drunk was not even enough to make this movie worth watching. Total garbage all the way through.. At least until I stopped watching which was about 30 minutes into it.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|Started watching series on Netflix.  Was hooked from the start.  Had to buy 6th season to find out what happened.  Sad it is over.  Love Ed Westwick....
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Love this beautifully elegant puzzle game.  The music sets a lovely mood for a wonderful and calming puzzle experience. I sincerely thank you for this game.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|If u like mario this game is just like it! My son loves to play it!<br /><br />It does seem alil easier than mario but its still a fun game to play just tried it n like haven't played very long so idk what its gonna be like when I get farther along in the game but so far great game!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is a wonderful book to read! Classic Nicholas sparks with romance and a little bit of tear jerker going on. I recommend this book to anyone
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a grate game for me when there is nothing to do and very fun and addictive to play
B00BP4XDNQ|5.0|It's been years since I have seen this movie and it was just as great this time around. Can't wait to watch it again.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this series! I can't wait for the new season to begin again!  This is a great view of life in the early century.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This second book is as much of a page turner as the first. I highly recommend it, especially if you enjoyed the first book :)
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie was a gift to my mother, but after watching it I must say it is one of the best comedies I've seen in a while. This movie has all the right actors playing all the right parts and it leaves you wanting more. I loved this movie and would recommend it to others. ^-^
B001NLL93W|5.0|I could not put this book down.  There was action from beginning to end and so far this will be the best on big screen because of it
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|The Hobbit really manages to wow you in 3D. One of the first shots in the film is a puff of pipe smoke forming into a butterfly  which then fly's straight into your house. Their really aren't any pop out scenes after that,but the movie boast some great 3D depth and amazing effects to boot.<br /><br />The Hobbit at first moves at a very slow,almost I dare say a carefree pace,and where some have reservation against it,I for one really enjoyed that about this film. It doesn't seem to get to the point until the halfway mark and I applaud it for that.<br />As where the LOTR trilogy (as amazing as it was), moved the viewer as quickly as possible to tell the whole story The Hobbit more or less sits back,takes a deep breath,and lets you explore a more day to day middle earth for the first half of the film.<br /><br />It's fair to say The Hobbit hasn't been as enthusiastically received as the past three films and perhaps fairly so.<br />However, I see this more as a  \\"for the fans\\" type of film rather than something created for a wider audience.<br />So if you're ready to head back to the Shire and reunite with a few old friends go rent this for the weekend,but be warned,this is a different adventure all together. Some places will be warmly familiar,others will take you completely unaware.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Unlike other Bond movies dealing with aging actors, Skyfall embraced what was best about Daniel Craig (worn and suave at the  same time) and went with it.  Tight and exciting. The shoot out at the end was a little silly, but isn't all  of Bond a bit like that?  Judy Dench and the new Q were good (although the latter reminded me a bit too much of Matt Smith from Doctor Who).
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I love this app it is awesome! Everybody should have it. It is so cool I love it. I love it
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Great movie! Would watch again and again. Wonderful story line, music, filmography.  This movie has it all.  Watch it now!
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|Though I personally loved this film I can see why some shy away. The movie does move slow in the beginning yes,but to me this movie is truly like a roller coaster in that you're going up this huge hill very slowly,but when you reach the peak and then plummet,your heart is in your throat the whole time.<br />Life of Pi is truly one of those films that has it all. Heavy emotional drama,comedy, suspense,you name it you'll find a little bit of it in this film and its all done almost flawlessly.<br />The character of Richard Parker is one of the best I think I've personally ever seen but what makes the Tiger companion so great isn't anything he does through the film but Pi's attachment to the animal.<br /><br />The 3D in this film is exceptional. I won't spoil anything,but the scene with the flying fish is probably the greatest 3D moment in any film to date. So if your a 3D buff,this movie is worth it for that one scene alone.<br /><br />I give the 3D 5 stars and the film itself 4.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Visually stunning. It keeps you captivated for the entire length. Many layers of meaning woven between the images and dialog making it a good movie for all ages. My son commented the movie was perhaps better than the book.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I've played Bejeweled in the past and was looking for an app that was similar.  Very pleased with this app and am enjoying playing it!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I think it was factual and well written. It answered several questions I had been wondering about. Really to bad he got murdered.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This program is like an english version of Little House on the prairie.  Just completed watching the entire season 1 and absolutely loved this program.  I am looking forward to viewing the rest of the seasons.
B0016OLC5Q|4.0|This may remind you of a free spirit you might have met or admired in your life. It was enjoyable
B00993FEUK|4.0|I liked the movie in the theaters so I knew I would like it on DVD. The price was acouple dollars cheaper then Wal-Mart so I am glad that I saved but other words nothing special. But Happy.
B00BYOEZTI|5.0|Now I'm an avid Tolkien fan from back in high school.  Trust me, that's years before The Lord of the Ring movies were made :)  I love them.  They're not perfect, and there's things in them I wish Peter Jackson left out.<br /><br />Now, this is a review for The Hobbit, but my feelings are the same.  Great acting, beautiful cinematography and lush scenery.  But still, there are a few things Peter Jackson over uses and over does.  But I still love this movie, even with its flaws.<br /><br />I rented the movie digitally knowing an Extended Edition will be available sometime around November, and I'm not going to purchase a movie when there's a director's cut coming out soonish.<br /><br />If you enjoyed your time in Middle Earth with The Lord of the Ring movies, you'll love going &#34;home&#34; again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game.by the way I went to Rome.it didn't look anything like subway surfers.and there weren't any Easter eggs.

B000FA675C|5.0|I really enjoyed this book when I first read it years ago. Having recently found it on a free download I was extremely delighted to re-read it. Author Dan Brown has an incredible way of writing and conveying his ideas with just enough character and description to paint a vivid picture in your mind while captivating you and holding you in suspense in the plot. Very well done book.
B008ZEIAYQ|4.0|I like her unique sound. There is about three sounds I like. Her sound is refreshing. I like it a lot.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This historical drama shows the intricacies of aristocratic life as a well as the lives of those who serve them. There is decite, betrayal, forbbiden love, jealousy, unrequited love, infidelity, sex, death and money... The list goes on. Americans love that crap. And I am an American! Yup, the Brits have done it again and we are hooked.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What's not to love about this fascinating, extraordinary account of life on both sides of British society at the turn of the last century and beyond?  Brilliantly written, researched, with a cast beyond compare!  I've been hooked since season one!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|When DeMille fist published I enjoyed everything he wrote.  With the Panther I feel he is writing the same story that Vince Flynn and others have written.  I was a bit disappointed
B00AO686MY|5.0|it was a very very good movie my wifey likes it alot. thank you sooo much it was awsome thanks
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The book was great.  I suggested it to staff and may others to read.  If you are reading this and looking for something to read get this book!!
B009VMN3RA|5.0|I have been a fan of Shirley MacLaine as far back as THE APARTMENT and all through her mega career. She stands today as one star who did it all; Dancer-Actress-Author-Metaphysician.<br /><br />Reading Sachi Parker's revealing account of her own life with a mother as famous as Ms. MacLaine was candid, humourous, sad and, at times, shocking!  She took us to places and experiences  obviously never known by the general public and just as well.  It's a fascinating memoir showing what life was like living in the shadow of a famous parent, often on the sidelines, but nevertheless a special person in her own right.  Kudos to Ms. Parker!  I couldn't put it down!  -  Christine Fournier, former Broadway dancer
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|This is almost a perfect movie. Very original premise, terrific main and supporting actors, sharp writing, good direction.<br /><br />It's a heart-warming little comedy and a lot of fun to watch. It moves along so effortlessly that you don't think about it, but the plot and the pacing are really tight.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game rocks! There are endless possibilities!I enjoy every part of it from mining diamonds to fighting monsters!This is the best app ever!
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|It takes a little getting use to. Navigation is a little different than from a desktop or laptop. I guess it is ok.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love it! At first, I thought this game wasn't worth spending $6.99 but my friend got it on her ipad mini and said it was awesome.I bought it and now it is usually the only game I play. It's awesome and I recommend it. Now I just need it for the Xbox.
B0067R0APK|3.0|I can't get the radar portion to expand.  It isn't any better than the regular program.  I won't spend any money on it
1609611543|5.0|This book will really change your life.  It makes you think about what ails you and if a small change of dropping wheat can help.  I was skeptical.  Too many times we read THE SECRET to better health.  This does not require you to buy into weird diet tricks.  I makes sense to me...
B009KEN87O|3.0|This is a great old school game that both I and our 9 yr old enjoy. The only problem is there are no instructions. Now we are stuck on level 9-1. We have tried numerous time and no one can break this level. Even had older &quot;gaming&quot; kid try and still no luck. Would have given this 5 stars prior to this level.  We will keep trying though since we really like the game!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great book!! So well written!! Totally different story than the movie, but the characters were so lovable! Pat Peoples is an awesome character!!!
B000S9HVZU|3.0|This is an interesting book.  It's fairly challenging in form and flow, but it's also pretty accessible for anyone who's a steady reader.  It's based on a conceit, or a series of conceits, that weave together the lives of three women living decades apart and in different parts of the country.  The women themselves are very different, too, but they share a tendency towards deep introspection and engaging in a lot of regret about their paths their lives have taken. Interestingly, all three acknowledge to themselves that they have actually quite lucky about how their lives have turned out and have, more or less, avoided tragedy.<br /><br />The conceit is how the author weaves these stories together.  One story line follows author Virginia Woolf, beginning with her suicide by drowning.  It then looks back at her daily routine and the depression that ruled her life, even as she crafted masterpieces such as \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\"<br /><br />The second story follows Clarissa, a 50-ish lesbian intellectual who's living in Greenwich Village in the 1990s. AIDS is ravaging the male gay community, and Clarissa is watching the only man she loved, Richard, die of AIDS just as he's becoming acknowledged as a great poet. Richard named Clarissa \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" when they met as college students, by the way.<br /><br />The third story looks at Laura Brown, a bookish housewife and mother in 1950s Los Angeles. She's married to a war veteran who's adjusted very well to civilian life, and they're climbing the ranks in a brand-new suburb north of Los Angeles.  But Laura is probably clinically depressed.  She's reading \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" on the day of her husband's birthday.<br /><br />Clarissa's story gets the most attention. Unfortuantely, it's the least interesting for me. It's obvious stuff like intellectuals sort of sneering at writers who have more temporal success, or lesbians challenging each other for either selling out by acting \\"normal\\" or putting on a show by trying to be butch.  And Richard, whose mind is allegedly so ravaged by age that he can't remember if he went to a party in his honor, will suddenly clear his mind and have a deep conversation with Clarissa. Not realistic.<br /><br />I find that story of Laura much more compelling. She simply wants to stay in bed and read, while abandoning all the responsibilities that she never intentionally accepted.  I feel that way sometimes, and then I just put my shoulder to the wheel and go on -- just like Laura.  The Virginia Woolf story is interesting in the sense that you see inside the mind of a smart person who is frozen by indecision and depression.<br /><br />Here's what I like about the story.  I love the descriptions of the physical world of New York, such as when Clarissa steps out from her brownstone on a beautiful summer morning to buy flowers.  The scene, the weather, even the sandpaper feel of the stoop on which she steps is perfectly rendered.  I also like Laura's panic and indecision in the face of her responsibility to her son -- but her ability to ultimately get through the day in a fog.  I also like the interweaving of themes to pull together the stories.  It's done with flowers, bowls, relations with busy-body neighbors, and even sexually charged kisses between women who aren't necessarily lesbians but might have been tempted if they lived in another era.  Sometimes, the linking of themes is a little contrived, because one chapter might end with Clarissa thinking about a yellow scarf and the next will start with something yellow in front of another person. But it's effective, by and large.<br /><br />Anyway, it's a good book with an interesting idea. But the execution is not good enough to merit a super-high rating (nor a Pulitzer Prize, to be honest).

B00BYOEMTQ|2.0|I strongly encourage to make the trip to the video store for this one the streaming was terrible LOTS OF LAG!!!!! I am a prime member have streamed lots of movies both free and new release rentals and this has been the only time I have experienced streaming issues:( I lost interest when viewing and found myself walking away and doing other things so for the movie I can not review as I have not watched the whole movie. The 2 star rating is more for Amazon's instant video rental of this movie very dissapointing!
B00005N6KG|4.0|Love these simple, inexpensive earphones!  I don't like earbuds so these are perfect!  I have had similar ones before and always liked them for the gym.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book and the characters. As the book unraveled each mystery I was captivated and floored. Lots to twists. Heart wrenching sadness and joy. Love the author. Can't wait for the next book

B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Worth the wait!  Glad I bought it.Anne Hathaway was wonderful, she sang with her heart and had me in tears.
B003S9W8EQ|5.0|Without end emontion and adventure. Every chapter a new adventure. all kinds of emotions and difficult to drop<br /><br />Excellent book a classical Follet
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Fun and addictive take on the typical jewel swapping game type. As you travel around the world you are challenged with several timed puzzles at each stop. Got this for my 8 year old, who loves it, but I've been playing it every night. - Great Game.
B005K01VZS|4.0|Read the whole book on a 3 hour plane trip. Lots of food for thought. Have enjoyed most of his books
B004X2M9VY|5.0|I love the charisma of Matt Smith as the doctor. I really hope he stays on for a long time.
B00BEZTMFY|2.0|I wanted to like this movie but just couldn't.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars and not lower is that it had some of the original stars.  The movie was slow, dull and some of the characters a bit corny. My husband and I made it through the movie but we both kept getting up to take care of things and didn't \\"pause the movie\\".  Don't waste your money buying a copy.  We rented it on TV for $4.99 and thank goodness we didn't spend any more by going to the movies. We were disappointed and bored.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|We expected a story about surfing the big waves. We didn't expect the coming of age, the building a life up for so many of the characters, their successes, and ultimately surprising heartbreaks.<br /><br />The story was extremely well crafted, with great acting. Not to mention some really incredible wave shots.<br /><br />This captured the full attention of myself, my wife, and our 14 year old daughter. It was a beautiful moving that really engaged us all.
B00914JWSW|5.0|The greatest.  It is difficult to &#34;review&#34; a Streisand album because there aren't words to describe the beauty and soulfulness of her voice.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|this is a great app.  I love the no thinking mentality.  If you just want to veg.  out this is the game for you.<br />no stress @ all!!!
1455519650|3.0|I am new to the Harry Bosch series but it appears that Connelly uses the same recipe for the books.  The story line is predictable and mildly enjoyable.  I really give this book a 3.5 star rating
B004X4QW42|5.0|One of those rare sequels that is as good or better than the original. Great story and action. Casting is great, fight sequences are fantastic. This goes on my top shelf of martial arts favorites along with the original Ip Man.
0788859544|5.0|This movie is just as wonderful as when it first came out, will be a great addition to our movie collection.
B000025D7S|5.0|Fantastic compilation of Gershwin tunes sung by a host of contemporary artists, all of whom are accompanied by the legendary harmonica virtuoso Larry Adler.  This is one compact disc I play over and over again. Whether you're a Gershwin fan or not, if you simply enjoy really great renditions of classic standards, it's my guess you'll appreciate this CD.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I had seen how cancer affect people's life. It was a great good what you did. He was able to mix reality with a love story.
B007N5YJWK|5.0|The 39 Steps has excellent picture and sound with the Criterion Collection Blu-ray version.  The movie is an early Hitchcock film with the wit, pacing, and suspense that made the director famous.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|I really enjoyed the books in the series hard to stop reading when i got started.  Just like this show was hard to stop watching once i started.  They really bring the people from the book to life.  Sure a few things get lost from book to screen but that always is the case. If your fan of the book you should love the show.<br /><br />P.S.<br />  Very adult oreintated like the books put kids to bed before watching.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|This book swept by so fast that I was upset when it ended.  Such good reads are that way.  I would like to have learned the forgers trade right along with her.  It certainly have added to the story.  Mine isn't a long winded review and the only negative I can give this book is it being in the short story club.  I'm off to read Warbreaker and am hoping for it to be top grade.
B000SX89TS|5.0|This is a must-have recording if you're into electronica. Taken as a whole, listening to this is like taking a stroll through someone else's dreams. The soundscapes are lush, propelled by forward by rich and vibrant melodies. And there's just enough Continental étrangeté to keep you from drifting off into the ether.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|Just enough tech talk and adventure. A read page turner. I am going to read the rest of these books so I can find out what happened.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Series Two exceeded all expectations. looking forward to season three.  Best TV series I have seen for a long time
B0014DC0AK|5.0|lots of great lyrics and drum work! must get! I think its the second best death album made. Amazing death metal band.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|This movie is a great family movie. It has some good songs in it and some comedy for the adults.
B008Q0D9DG|5.0|This movie is worth a re-viewing on a periodic basis as the characters are complete enough to warrant the audiences' interest. A great movie!
B008YRVW0I|5.0|A great game. I'm enjoying it very much. Would reccomend it for any age.  I have it on my Kindle Fire.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I have consistently enjoyed Jack Reacher; he is completely unorthodox, always standing up for the weak and wounded.  Lee Child's grasp of time, physics, and geometry never cease to amaze me, and his descriptive word usage is astounding....I can easily picture the exact local and circumstances........thoroughly captivating.<br />The Affair was especially good; interesting to read about his last days in the military.  Reacher at 13 (Second Son) was nothing less than what we would expect of him.  Both reads were excellently entertaining!
B001UGB1X8|3.0|Its okay, little over the top.  For a older person was really strong, for a cop did not use legal means to solve the case.  My take is this character should retire.
B00B7G23KQ|2.0|It is interesting how certain franchises can limp along from one to the next with virtually no improvement. This is such an example. Avoid it if you are a thinking person. Otherwise, if the grandkids want a couple of &#34;jumps&#34; knock yourself out but don't complain when you fall asleep in the middle of the movie.
B007PPE086|4.0|I wish I found this doll on the shelf at stores when is was like 12$ cuz that's all its really worth...  it's cool to add to my collection, love the short hair, and black & white is diffrent.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|This game by FAR exceeded my expectations. If you have any interest at all in shooter games, don't hesitate to buy this game. This game is a 2D shooter where you fly around as a plane. There is a simple joystick control and a button to fire. Sounds fairly simply, but the game is quite addicting. The controls are fantastic, very rarely do I find my plane not going where I want it to. There are also a TON of planes that you can unlock and each plane feels unique and definitely has its own feel to flying and weapon that it shoots. The difficulty also progresses nicely. Overall, one of my favorite games I have on my phone.
B007RI56NY|5.0|Train is one of my favorite bands and this is a great cd I love it and would not trad it for the world.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app is true to its name! The settings are great and it should really help me when I need to wake up. The only bad thing is that it wears out my battery pretty quick because I leave it on all night.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I had friends telling me that I needed to read it and they read it in just a few days - or less! So when I got sick over Easter Break, I found that it was a good time to read. As frightening that this story may be, it sure does sound a lot like Cuba and the way they treat their people. Wheat, and meats are outlawed for it's people and they will be put in jail if they are found drinking milk over the age of infancy. Scary stuff, people. They have the touristy section, and then real Cuba. We aren't that far behind....
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this because the complexity increases with each level I complete. I think it's easy to see even though I only have the 7&#34; screen. I did get the free version with ads across the bottom of the screen but it doesn't usually interfere with play.
B002JODUI4|5.0|deadmau5 is a great Dubstep band and I am glad that it is on my I-pod and it sounds great in my car what can I say.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|Not happy at all with this microphone.  Not sure if the cord or internals have stopped working but it is far too new for this to happen
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this app! The horses are so realistic and taking care of them is hard work but good fun. awesome!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this app for keeping my reading plan on track. It sends me daily reminders to read and keeps track of exactly where I am. It also records if I skip a day and lets me go back and pick up what I missed. It lets me highlight and bookmark, BUT it isn't searchable by books or chapters, only by months and days of reading. And of course it isn't accessible at all when I'm not connected to the Internet, which is bothersome if I'm too far from a wifi connection.
B004L84S0K|5.0|this is a great cd I love the songs on it I would buy it over and over again if I could
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have read every book that Mr Sparks has written and have never been disappointed - can't say the same about the movies made from some of the books.  I wait for each new book to come out.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is a really fun game and is good for all ages. I play it all the time. Even my little brother plays it and my mom too.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like this game because it is relaxing and helps to pass the time away when I am sitting in the waiting room at the doctor's office . Spider solitaire is challenging, trains the mind to make logical decisions and gives the player the option to choose what level to play. I recommend this game to people of all ages.
B005AERS74|5.0|I am a big fan of Maroon 5 and could not wait till I got this product it is one of my fav cd.
B004L07KWQ|1.0|The app will  not close out.  I've re-booted and tried three times and the only way to get out of the app is to shut down my Kindle Fire.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|A little slow an drawn out but gets better as you read. A little off the movie. Still think its a great book.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This story is so enjoyable to watch--one of my favorites by far!  I know I will be watching the whole series again and again!
B009DP9D6A|5.0|deadmau5 is a great Dubstep band and I am glad that it is on my I-pod and it sounds great in my car what can I say.
B005KELQEU|5.0|I would like to order another one to have as a gift or in reserve.  Can you assist me with this request?
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book jumps, and leaves you hanging  very badly.  Descriptions were very clear of the time period but as i SAID ON THE OTHER REVIEW  OH WELL ENOUGH SAID/
B00338QENI|5.0|Very moving.  I felt the pain and frustration of the family of Henrietta.  Thank you R Skloot for your determination to get the story out to the public.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I like this cd it is a good choice if you like Bruno Mars I like his music or I would not have bought it
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Great app for thinking. and making things work. Twist it this way and you see this. Twist it that way and who knows where you are. Love to play it.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|I found this book to be disjointed and hard to follow. definitely not up to her usual standards. first book i haven't really enjoyed by kathy reichs.
0812992792|2.0|I REALLY DIDN'T CARE FOR THIS BOOK AT ALL. I DIDN'T LIKE THE STORY AND THOUGHT IT TOO BRUTAL IN THE TORTURE. AT FIRST, I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE STORY AT ALL. FINALLY UNDERSTOOD IT, BUT JUST THOUGHT IT STRANGE.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Five stars was an easy call for overall content. Excellent wrap up with the ending being left open enough to give hope for several future Fever books. Sensual, intriguing and thought-provoking. The only minor criticism would be that some of Mac's soul searching and anguish tended to drag on a little to long and I would start wishing for someone to show up and tell her to get the fecked on with it. Can't wait for future MacKayla novels.
B007SGM084|5.0|Could not put down!!!!! Is a raunchy read but has a great story line. Love love LOVED it! Will read again
B004XUMMFE|5.0|One of the great shows that got cancelled WAY to early.  Very well written, acted.  Lots of jokes, action, and great storylines.
030758836X|2.0|I KNOW THIS BOOK IS ON THE BEST SELLER LIST, BUT I DIDN'T CARE FOR IT AT ALL. I THOUGHT IT WAS A SICK STORY AND NOT TO MY TASTE. TALKED TO OTHERS, WHO DIDN'T LIKE IT EITHER.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much because it's really fun and it's exciting I love the power ups and characters that's it by Mariah
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really wish I had never found this app I get way too addicted to it and suddenly discover I've lost two hours of my life!  Haha But really I love Pintrest so much fun stuff to be found on here.  Just be careful if you have tweens because there is a lot of language and sometimes pretty nasty stuff!
B0037QM8YA|1.0|it does not work, i have try on 3 different  PCs it stops after few seconds  so i have vary bad experiences
B008MG1E4A|5.0|None of us truly know what happened that night but I am more apt to believe a Navy Seal that was on the ground before I would someone else!
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|The book jumps around a bit, but it is funny and makes me like Tina Fey more.  I actually feel a little sorry for her now after she shared her stresses and anxieties.  Good read. You'll laugh out loud.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its fun to play the different games. I don't get so bored because I can always switch. I like unlocking new games.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|You Should Really Get This Game! If You like Racing Games Then Beach Buggy Blitz Is The Game 4 YOU!!!
B0079XNWQA|5.0|I enjoy Jason Mraz's music and this CD does not disappoint.  It is one great song after another.  The end.
B0037NVM2C|5.0|In this version, the sections that were edited out of the original provide a continuity that aid in the telling of the complete story. Although you might not miss what you have not originally seen, once these pieces are added they clarify the parts that somehow never made sense. I'm glad that I watched it again just for the clarification these pieces bring in this total version.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Well written and superbly acted series. I can't wait for season four to be available. As always, Maggie Smith is excellent and is surrounded by fine actors playing interesting characters
B008OOYALE|5.0|i like this game but it can get boring i play fashion story abd the only reason why i got this app cuz irlt was a mission on fashion story
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|One of my favorites from Nicholas Sparks. I did not expect it turn out the way that it did. I can't wait to share
B00BEJB0CS|3.0|I haven't read this yet, but did receive it on time and in good condition for a good price. Y
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|nice game.. nothing like the original yet still fun in its own right. Not fond of the enegry resource it seems gimicky to me.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This is good for weather updates while away from my computer. Its pretty accurate and easy to use. Try it!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The prowess alone reaches out and pulls you to grab you tight.. before you know it you like it, you're losing sleep, you're taking regions quotes literally that reading is in fact better than sleep.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I enjoyed books from earlier in the series and love this one too. I hope too see another series from Jeff Kinney.
B009FZFONO|4.0|I really liked the beginning of this season, but it starts to lag and more than anything some things happen which make no logical sense.  It the 1st and 2nd season whenever something happened you would agree that the show was consistent and felt like real life.  There is a few times in season 3 that the show just completely goes against logic which really frustrated me.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Its just another tool on your phone. I Haven't used it to wake me up yet, but easy to use.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Even better than the first shocking how well the story line meshes and stays true to the first book. Land Mark series.
B008NABUU8|4.0|i like it because i like building thing.  and thats just me but its a cool game. so if u get the chance i would goahed and buy
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Love the game I bet if you try it you would love it also . this game is for all ages.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a great app for weather watchers. Gives a good bit of info on weather. Tells you what days are good/bad for health like arthritis.
B00280LYIM|5.0|5 stars I loved it and Nico is my new favorite. I wish I were the son of Hades :)
B003YL4L0W|5.0|Challenging always Jodi leads us down the path we don't expect and teachers some important lessons. What she can't answer she gracefully leaves to the reader.
B009KEN87O|3.0|I tried this game and its just not my kind of game, if you like the atari games in the 80's you will like this game
B001N4Q4MA|5.0|I purchased the movie for my children but I have enjoyed watching it with them. The movie is entertaining  with a lesson to boot.
B00BKTFABE|3.0|I don't like the front facing camera angle. It is hard to get a good picture. Otherwise it is fine.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Touching story.  Highly recommend this book.  I felt the pain and joy of all the different characters and their circumstances.
B0060AY6FO|4.0|It was a good addition to the classic by Jane Austen. The characters stayed true to hers, but their was an added suspense of the mystery.
B007HACDLK|5.0|One of Vince Flynn's better books.  From the very beginning, the action starts and doesn't let up.  Love the Mitch Rapp character and Flynn doesn't disappoint.  Typical twist during the story and of course, Flynn presents certain politicians and/or agency characters that you just don't like.  The story moves along very well and it has the substance that this either did happen or could happen.  Excellent book and highly recommend this book if you're a &#34;Mitch Rapp&#34; fan or if you like action books.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|I don't use everything, but use app often. Glad I was able to download for free - although, I would have paid too.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I thought the movie was good but my grand children thought it was totally wonderful. They gave it 5 stars . I like the lessons about life , love, accepting others when they are trying to become their better selves. Disney is a National Treasure.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Didn't care for the Bin Ladin raid storyline, but Chastain was the reason we watched this, and she is amazing!!!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|For a nerd growing up in the 80's, it is a pretty great book.  Also a great commentary on where we are headed with these online worlds we are creating etc.  I would recommend it to any fellow sci-fi nerd.

B004MC8CA2|2.0|I was looking for a Bible app I could use when I am offline.  If you are not connected to the Internet you can't even read the Bible.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is a great sequel to the first. Can't wait to read the final book. Have definitely recommend this to everyone.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I was dying for this game to come out for kindle as soon as i saw it i hit download when i started playing it worked perfectly had no problem loging in to Facebook best game ever!

1401924352|5.0|My daughter admires Miranda Kerr and had been waiting for this book to come to America. I thumbed through it and was impressed by this Victoria Secrets model inspiring encouragement and esteem lifting ideals.
B00B2TUKI0|1.0|I bought this CD because it got a glowing review in the local paper.  Since I had heard some of her previous recordings, I didn't go through and listen to each track - big mistake.  The vocals are insipid and the best way to describe the CD is \\"bland\\".  Her rendition of \\"Gentle on My Mind\\" was cringe-worthy and I had to turn it off.  The liner notes says that this is \\"For Mom\\" - hope she likes it.  After one listen-through, it went into the resale bin.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I was kind of skeptical about buying another game for my Kindle HD Fire but I saw \\"Cubistry\\" and thought I'd \\"maybe\\" like it. Boy was I wrong! I love, love, love it!! It's fun, so colorful and the way you can move the cube around to different angles to find matches is great. No glitches, so far, which I seem to find in so many games. Just a great, all around game that I'd recommend to anyone!!
B000EYK2GE|5.0|I own the DVD on this cocert. The CD is just as good as the DVD. Carl Perkins is great with all of his friends.
B006LSZECO|2.0|It took me a while to buy the book. I didn't want to spend $12.99 on it but I finally gave in after it was on the most popular list for a while.<br />The book could have been SO good!!! The ending was horrible!!! All of that for NOTHING! I really wanted to love this book and I hate to give bad reviews but I have to! Save your money.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I cant believe this game was free! Its a game and it has great quality! I'm very happy with this app
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm seriously concerned about the state of the female mind in the U.S. if this is what we consider a good book.
B003TVMIDO|5.0|It's great having all of the music of John Lennon in one Box set - remastered. I recommend it for eveyone who loves John's music.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I need something reliable that I can use when I am travelling and that also can be persistent when you are tired from different time zones. This app makes sure I get up when I am supposed to.
B005K17RU0|2.0|The latest update looks awful on the Kindle Fire.  The old format was colorful and clear, whereas the new format is bland and busy.  I'm going to start looking for a new weather app.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I'm really enjoying this game but it is addictive, my 10 year old sometime plays over my shoulder, she takes one side and me the other.  We have fun.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I found Night Circus a unique and very entertaining read.  It is written in the present tense, while the chapters are intentionally not in chronological order.  (I actually made myself a little outline to help with the time line the first time I read it.)<br />The tale itself contains elements reminiscent of several other classic stories, and that perhaps contributes to its appeal.  For example, the circus appears and disappears somewhat like the town of Brigadoon, but not in the same way.<br />The characters are well developed, given the limited and not-quite-real universe Ms. Morgenstern has created.  I was drawn in completely into the lives of all the fascinating people who create and maintain the Circus.  Their backgrounds, motives and interactions hold your attention as you try to untangle what the Challenge entails, how it can be won and who will win it.<br />The writing style is delicate, bordering on poetic at times.  The death of a central character is described in just six words that are more devastating than a paragraph.<br />It is difficult to adequately praise this work without giving away too much of the story, but, trust me, it is well worth reading.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys well written mystery, romance and adventure.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction.  Very entertaining, you'll love all the characters and innuendo.  Worth every minute.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I really like it but what I don't like is if it is free why do I have to buy more bingo chips?
B000OVLINI|5.0|Although the plot may stretch belief, with all the coincidences, I enjoyed it. Fun enjoyable characters.  I definitely would like to read more of Zafon's books.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is a story that should break your heart, but it is so beautifully written and you become so involved with each character that it really is okay whatever the ending is. I can not say enough about how well this book touched me, how I felt I knew each character personally and how I just wanted to keep reading. Please don't let the subject matter keep you from reading this superb book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction.  Very entertaining, you'll love all the characters and innuendo.  Worth every minute.
1933952806|5.0|I haven't read it yet.................. So idk what to say. It looks good tho so you should get it. Nikon is awesome oh yeah
B009GEAPYW|5.0|This was an amazing adaptation of the Frank Miller classic.  It is a truly rare occurrence when a comic adaptation is kept true to its source and this one is about as faithful as it can get.  I was iffy when I heard Petter Weller was going to be voicing Batman but to my surprise, he pulls off the older weary Batman perfectly.  I have seen some people complain about the art in some of the reviews here.  The art is actually a faithful reproduction of the stylized art of the original pencil artist for the comic books.  As for those people that gave it one star complaining the they were mislead by the title, sorry but thats the original title of the 25 year old comic.  They did not name it that way to trick you into buying it.  The first sentence of the product description states that it is animated and the box art is a comic book drawing.  In my opinion a great story that will not leave you disappointed even if the purchase price is a little steep considering you have to buy part one and part two.  A bundle price would be nice.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app because it has more than the survival craft and it has more seeds and I just love it
B007MG360G|2.0|Keeps stopping and crashing on my kindle fire! It'd be great if you could sort it out. It's really annoying,!!!!
B00B49L7JY|5.0|It seems that much of our society yearns for authenticity amidst reality shows and consumerism.  This story is powerful, beautiful, and inspiring.  To Rodriguez and those responsible for this movie, I say Thank You.  And, if you're considering watching it, I highly recommend it.

B00A8KJK7G|5.0|THE MOVIE PLAYS VERY GOOD.......THE MOVIE WAS PACKAGED WELL AND WAS GIFT NEW.  BOTH THE GRANDCHILDREN ENJOYED SEEING THE MOVIE.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was a great book. Kept me on my toes wanting to read more and more I felt like I was really there!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Another of my favorite authors, I must have read all his books. I know it's not historically accurate, but it's not meant to be, but it's  a jolly good read . Far far better than the TV production, but as it such a thick book, read it on a kindle.<br />OOPS, just noticed, I reviewed the wrong book !!
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I have bought these pacifier/toys for each of my great-grandbabies and plan to buy them for all future additions to our family.  The mothers love them because they help the baby keep the pacifier in his/her mouth.  I have bought lots of these.....in different &#34;critters&#34; and they are all so cute and soft.  My absolute favorites are the monkey and duck, but all the ones I have bought are very cute and well loved by the babies.  I would recommend them for all new babies.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Super Fun game to play! both my son and i love to play this game.  but beware once you start playing you wont want to stop
B004ISL4E6|5.0|Young manages to define creativity in an aw shucks manner that deprecates its sophistication. He absolutely gets it right as far as I'm concerned. I want my son, about to begin work in an architect's office, to read this and recognize its potential to help him today. If you substitute Young's 3 by 5 index cards with an iPad, you can't go wrong.
B00AW0KHMY|5.0|I expected the cover to be suede as it looked that way so I was a tad disappointed but being a huge twilight fan, I didn't worry, worth the money
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Interesting characters and story line. Great action, blood, guts and gore. My family looks forward to &#34;family time&#34; watching this show every week.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Unexpected love story  Christian. Has a lot of burdens and past history to deal. With hopefully  he and Ana will get together  together the way they belong
B00BF123WG|1.0|This is the type of propaganda that Goebbells would have approved of - the &#34;good guys&#34; just have no choice but to brutally torture suspected &#34;bad guys&#34; in order to effectively protect the Reich!  I hope this is all Hollywood and not the truth.<br /><br />Audio track is sketchy at times, probably on purpose to convey a sense of realism.  Character development is lacking.
