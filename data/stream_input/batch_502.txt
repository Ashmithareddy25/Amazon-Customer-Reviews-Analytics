B0009A1AS2|4.0|Overwhelmed by the bad commentaries i was hearing about this album i wrote this review.But after listen to this record more carefully, i found myself liking it even more, therefore i give this the 4 1/2 stars that it deserves.Since Amazon can't let this happen, feel free to consider this cd a 5 stars work.I really can't find flaws anymore and i love each and everyone of the songs.Well, here's my final insight about Octavarium:  It seems we all suffer loss of long time memory sometimes.Dream Theater always gives their music a new take with each studio album they release.Fans of When Dream And Day Unite didn't know what to think when Images And Words was released, fans of I&W felt cheated when Awake came out and so forth.The thing that should be of interest with this band is if the material is any good.And MY answer is: hell yeah!Panic Attack is a favorite of mine in this work.Octavarium, the title track is worth alone the price of the cd.Is nothing short of amazing and on the same level of quality as other epic scale songs written by the band.  The songs ARE heavy and i don'y find the pop factor in them, is just that they are not heavy in a plodding mid tempo way, instead the arrangements are written in a dynamic fashion with  an ever present melodic ingredient, allowing the songs to breathe and flow, giving them a sense of dynamics lacking in most heavy per s stuff.  Production values are great and you should now since a while ago that this comes Highly Recommended from me!
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Thank you! THANK YOU! THANK YOU, all of you on the SouthPark team! You finally made a movie that is so offensive (to everything) that it's unbearably funny!!!!! I take no offense to this movie personally but its HILLARIOUS!!! If you're allowed to (yeah some little kids probably tried to see this) THEN SEE IT *NOW*!!!!!! THIS IS THE FUNNIEST MOVIE IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND! IT EVEN BEATS South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut!!! funny movie! thank you all of you who made this! and as soon as you hear the line \\"It'll be 9/11 times 100... Jesus! that's... yes- 91,100!\\" you know that NOTHING in today's politics made it through this movie intact, and that's the way a comedy should be! *SEE THIS MOVIE NOW! IT DESERVES A 10/5!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*
B00005JNBQ|4.0|A co-worker of mine was a big fan of this film when it came out, and has never stopped talking about it.  When I finally saw the film, I wasn't disappointed.  The plot, in a nutshell, is...well, there really *isn't* much of a plot.  The film follows a few days in the life of Napoleon Dynamite, uber-geek.  He lives with his grandmother and brother, Kip.  When Grandma gets hurt, Uncle Rico moves in to take care of them (even though Kip is 30!).  Meanwhile, Napoleon befriends the new kid at school, Pedro, who is also a misfit. <br /> <br />I've only seen the film once so far, but I'm sure it will be even funnier the second time because the first viewing is spent \\"taking it all in\\".  It's very odd, and very funny, and I lost count of all the great quotable lines in the film.  Another thing worth mentioning is that they could show this film on network television without editing anything -- there is no foul language or content that would be inappropriate for young viewers.  I'm not one of those \\"holier than thou\\" types (who, quite honestly, I loathe, because they tend to be hypocrites), but as someone with a family, I can appreciate a film we can all watch together. <br /> <br />So check it out -- and stick around after the credits to see Kip singing to Lafawnduh!
B0009K7QZ8|2.0|I am the biggest O.C. fan ever, I made my college schedule so that i'd be able to watch the O.C. on Thursday nights, but I have the say that season 2 was a real disappointment.  Not only did they ruin Kirsten and Sandy's relationship, but they also got rid of Jimmy, and Kaleb died.  All the new characters they introduced sucked, and they didn't stick around very long.  Mischa Barton needs to take acting lessons, because there is more to being a good actress than the ability to cry on command.  Summer and Seth got annoying, and Ryan's totally different than he was in the first season.  Oh and whatever happened to Marissa's sister Kaitlin, don't they get breaks at boarding school.  This was a really good show and I hope the writers can get there act together for season 3, but in the mean time don't waste your money on this DVD, buy the One Tree Hill season 2 DVD instead.
0156027321|5.0|Life of Pi is a novel by Canadian author Yann Martel. The title character, an Indian boy from Pondicherry, explores the issues of religion and spirituality from an early age, and decides he will become a follower of at least three major religions. <br /> <br />The novel's plot begins when Pi (whose real name is Piscine)'s father, a zoo keeper, moves the family and a few animals by ship to Canada for a new start. The ship sinks, however, and Pi finds himself the sole survivor, lost at sea on a lifeboat. The last human survivor, anyway, for Pi soon finds out, to his terror, that he shares his 26-foot space with an orangutan, a hyena, a zebra, and a tiger named Richard Parker. What follows is a tale of survival in its rawest form, as Pi must deal with immediate human needs such as thirst, hunger, and shelter, all under the watchful eyes of a huge predator. <br /> <br />The book can justifiably be split into three parts, but as it is written with a certain fluid style, it works as a whole novel as well. The first part is a rumination on spirituality and Indian life through the eyes of a young boy. The second part (comprising most of the text) is a whimsical blend of detailed, realistic survival memoir and fantastic allegory in an almost medieval style. The end, in which Pi is rescued and the \\"reality\\" of his entire experience at sea is called into question, offers more insights into the twin thirst for survival and faith. <br /> <br />The \\"reality\\" also offers the reader a choice to actually choose the \\"story\\" they prefer. According to the author there are two ways of looking at the same reality and it requires a leap of faith to choose the \\"better\\" story. <br /> <br />There are three major religions of interest in this story: Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity, represented by Pi Patel. Also of interest is the philosophical concept of atheism, represented by Mr. Kumar. <br />  <br /> <br />

B0000C7GG2|5.0|Absolution is to Muse as Diorama is to Silverchair or OK Computer is to radiohead.  It's simply Muse's best effort thus far.  It's the conglomaration of everything they've been attempting up to this point rolled into one tightly knit bundle of musical freedom and epic sound.  Absolution has gutwrenching power, as well as, heartstopping melodies depending on which tracks you've got slicing the airwaves.  I've got everything they've put out from Showbiz forward, and there's no turning back after picking up my copy of Absolution.   <br />     Listen, if you like power emo stuff like Sunny Day Real Estate or acoustic rage like Dashboard Confessional~ do yourself a favor and take it to the next level.  Pick up a copy of Absolution and burn a few tracks for your friends.  You'll be the new music guru and chiefton of your particular clan and your entourage will be thanking you for months to come.
B000002MUQ|4.0|\\"Balance\\"(1995).Van Halen's tenth studio album(not counting their live record).    After Van Halen had tasted a lot of success in 1991 with their third album that had Sammy Hagar on lead vocals,\\"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\\",Van Halen fans kind of saw a new musical climate for VH,and this album,\\"Balance\\",proved just that. The songs here are longer-and darker as well. With this being said,this is not a grunge album or a Metallica album,and it is nothing close to either a grunge album or a Metallica album. It is just really different for a Van Halen album,although that doesn't mean that it's not good. It's really good. The opening track,\\"The Seventh Seal\\",starts off with church bells for sound effects,and then you hear the actual song-which is just amazing. The lyrics are really deep and emotional,and Sammy Hagar puts a lot of intensity in his singing here. Tracks like \\"Can't Stop Lovin' You\\" and \\"Not Enough\\" are Van Halen/Sammy Hagar ballads You've heard before,but wait-there are other surprises here. \\"Don't Tell Me(What Love Can Do\\")is sung from the point of view of a young man in the approximate age range of 17-21(if You've seen the video on Van Halen's \\"Video Hits Volume One\\" DVD You'll understand it more)who has been getting in trouble and is now wanting to commit suicide-and not even his girlfriend his able to stop him. As for the other tracks,\\"Amsterdam\\" is very cool and is the one song on this album that comes the closest to sounding like the Van Halen/David Lee Roth era,\\"Big Fat Money\\" and \\"Aftershock\\" both have Elvis Presley medleys to them,and I won't give away everything,but the closing track on this album,\\"Feelin'\\" is sung from the point of view of a very depressed person who can't stop all of these hard things that are closing in on him/her,and there is even a line in this song about politicians smkoing crack. With all of that being said,Eddie Van Halen,Alex Van Halen,Sammy Hagar,and Michael Anthony all wanted to accomplish a lot here.    Overall,this is a really good CD. A lot of people(mostly die hard David Lee Roth fans)have overlooked the Van Halen era with Sammy Hagar on lead vocals-don't overlook it the way other people have-sure,the VH/DLR era was more rocking than their era with The Red Rocker on vocals,but Sammy Hagar wanted Van Halen to accomplish a lot,and he did a good job at letting that happen.If You're new to Van Halen and you don't own a single album they did with Sammy Hagar on lead vocals,then get the Van Hagar albums in the order they were released(5150,0U812,For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge and then this)and if you are a loyal VH fan with either David Lee Roth or Sammy Hagar and you don't have this album yet,then what are you waiting for?    A great album,and now that The Red Rocker is again the lead singer for Van Halen,hopefully Eddie and the boys will pull themselves together and come out with a few new CDS.
B00005N5S2|5.0|This movie about the military carreer of General Douglas MacArthur from 1941 to 1953 is a very good one. You may like him or not but it not important. You may agree or disagree with his decisions but he has taken them. He was a great general and he was sure that he was always right. So, look at one of the mightest general of the U.S. Army. Is is a very good movie.
0743246616|5.0|I loved Magnolia's first book (absolutely the sweetest baking book ever) and this one is just as wonderful.  Try the peach pie with sugar cookie crust and you will think you've gone to heaven!! As with the first book, the ingredients are often what you have on hand and the instructions are easy to follow, plus it does not take a whole afternoon to make something sweet and wonderful for your family.  Just remember, you can never have too much sugar.
B000069HSP|5.0|The title should be : How to survive when you are 400 inexperienced U.S. soldiers surrounded by 2000 North Vietnamese Army soldiers? The answer is simple : stay together, fight to death and hope that you will received air support and ammunitions because you are stuck in a very bad place. This movie shows the difficulties of a war for the soldeirs when you are merely in a hand to hand fight. After this movie, I am sure that you will not wish to go to war in a place like that. Excellent movie
B0002NRRAG|5.0|I bought this CD having never heard of Madeleine Peyroux and can't stop listening to it. She has a velvety smooth voice, which lends itself to a very easy and soothing listening experience. Beautiful and calming, and makes a great CD to play during an evening get together with family/friends.
B00097A5HW|5.0|Generally speaking I am happy if I buy a CD where I enjoy half the songs; in this case, save for one or two which are OK, the rest are fantastic.  Personally, I don't understand why more people are not raving about \\"Obtener un si\\", a beautiful song in Brazilian style, and \\"Dia Especial\\", simply a beatifully sung melody. I think this CD brings a unique mixture of old style Shakira and new exploratory rythms.  I guarantee that most will find something to love in this CD. Salud Shakira! To your continued success!
0684859106|5.0|This is absolutely my favorite baking book.  The recipes are just as the title describes, &quot;old fashioned&quot;. The Traditional Vanilla Birthday Cake was a real hit with the kids and was just that,old fashioned and you could really taste the vanilla.  We did the &quot;pink icing and colored sprinkles thing&quot;  and it turned out wonderfully. I collect baking books and rate this my very favorite. If you want to bake cakes and pies that are reminiscent of your childhood, this is the book for you.
B0002NRRAG|4.0|While tempted to write a song by song analysis of this CD, I will show restraint and simply comment on the Holiday imitation complaints. As a collector of vintage Holiday, I actually had to listen for the similarities before I made the connection at all. Some of the phrasing is perhaps similar, (think any male singer in the late 40s and Sinatra) but Peyroux sings with her own voice, hits the standards with a new and often superior interpretation, with a band that is quite competent. A bit of repetition on the cymbals left me with a sense of one sound fits all, but Peyroux herself is a delight. If you love Holiday this CD won't give a Rich-Little-like shiver. With the rest of the music industry still trying to sound like Aretha Franklin, this is a relief. Peyroux has a bright future, send us more like her!
B0006L16N8|4.0|After repeatedly listening to \\"X&Y\\", Coldplay continue to work towards individuating themselves from U2 and Radiohead. This being their third album, it's certainly not \\"War\\" or \\"OK Computer\\". Coldplay continue to struggle with making every track count, and making each one stand out rather than blend together (which has been the problem on all their albums).<br /><br />That aside, they continue to be one of the most promising bands around. I liked the fact that they borrowed from Kraftwerk's \\"Computer World\\" for the song \\"Talk\\", and several of the songs do sound like U2 and The Beatles, but Coldplay do their own thing, particularly Chris Martin's vocals and lyrics. He sings in falsetto on several songs, and not since Barry Gibb, have I heard falsetto used to such great effect.<br /><br />There is the potential for several hit singles here besides \\"Speed Of Sound\\", which was an okay choice for first single. I think \\"White Shadows\\" or \\"Talk\\" should be the next choice, and \\"Fix You\\", \\"Swallowed In The Sea\\" and \\"The Hardest Part\\" could all be hits. If you bought your \\"X&Y\\" at Target, you get a free download for the song \\"Animals\\", which didn't do anything for me, and I'm glad they left it off the album.<br /><br />The only other thing that slightly annoyed me was the album's 13 tracks and nearly 63 minute running time. I'm a post-punker, and I like my albums 45 minutes and under, and I think they could have easily left of \\"X&Y\\", \\"A Message\\" and \\"Low\\" without losing any integrity. This album will probably be voted one of the best albums of the year and garned all kinds of Grammy nominations, but I'm still waiting for Coldplay to do an \\"Achtung, Baby\\" or \\"White Album\\" about face with their music.
B00004RF9B|5.0|It is amazing that after almost 50 years this movie still holds up. The special effects are pretty good by 1956 standards. The acting is actually good too. And then there is Robby! I could watch the whole movie just to see Robby! I have seen this movie more times than I can count and I never tire of it.  <br /> <br />If you are a science fiction buff, then you should definitely add this classic movie to your collection.  <br /> <br />A bit of trivia... this movie was the first big-budget sci-fi movie produced from a major Hollywood studio (MGM). Prior to Forbidden Planet, any and all sci-fi movies were low budget B grade movies that had minimal special effects and were produced by small, independent studios. <br /> <br />Anyway, I LOVE this movie and I hope you will as well.
B00005JNJT|5.0|I just saw this movie and I came out of the theater really satisfied that it wasn't another Bat-astrophy.  Even more than that, it's a well plotted, intense action movie.  The best so far this summer.  They should bury those other four Bat-movies.  Well, maybe that's not fair.  This movie does owe a little to Tim Burton's original, but it has so much more substance to it.  For the first time Bruce Wayne is a three dimensional character I sympathized with.  His early years of training and the characters he encounters have far reaching effects on him, as do his parents.  And boy, does the suspense really build as the clock ticks down on Gotham City's fate.   <br />  Something kind of interesting is, there aren't any big superhero fight scenes like we've seen in movies like Spider-man or X-men.  The fighting is gritty, camera-shaking action, usually shown in glimpses.  And there are trippy hallucinations that amp up the scary factor a bit.  It is intense...and just a great movie.  I want to see it again.
0393035158|5.0|Let me congratulate Sam Harris on publishing such a timely and intellectually vigourous book, the breath of fresh air through my mind is invigourating.  I'm not sure if anyone has seen the film \\" The Man who sued god?\\" ( A must see for the legal arguments against the Catholic Church and the Vatican) But on reading this book, its struck me that someone could quite reasonably sue the Bible and the Koran for promulgating religious intolerance and promoting civil disobedience, the irony of that law suit would tickle my funny bones for eternity.  I live in hope. Heres another bit of irony, trying to find this book in a Borders bookshop in Oxford UK, I gave up and asked for assistance, I'd looked in the philosophy section, the religious section and even sociology no luck.  \\" Sure,\\" I was informed, \\" its in the Bible section\\" hahahah... and it was.. tucked away at the bottom of the shelf! One wonders who put it there?  Someone who could see the irony of their actions or a terrified Christian hoping against hope that the person who would have an interest in this book would not look there of all places! Hard luck, those of us who value reason will find it, thank you Sam Harris please continue to provoke and entertain.  J Jenkins (UK)
6305127689|5.0|Tom Cruise AND Meg Ryan, together in one movie, makes this the ultimate CHICK FLICK.  Cruise is at his hottest and just the mere presence of Meg Ryan in a movie (When Harry met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle, City of Angels,...) gives validation to the statement that \\"women everywhere will love this movie and it will be universally accepted as a chick flick\\".  As for the guys: some jet fighters, a motorcycle, and a couple of explosions will keep the men from realizing this movie was made with a woman in mind until long after the credits have ceased to roll.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|From \\"Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)\\" to \\"In The Back Seat\\" the album is in every way flawless. This is one of those bands that you know if they had more attention, they'd probably be \\"one of the biggest things\\". I bought this album not expecting much, I got it because I thought the name was catchy. But I was in for a huge suprise. Listen to it, and you'll know what I mean.
B000641Z90|5.0|First of all, this DVD is not for Genesis fans and Phil Collins specified it in the booklet. His career was pretty wide in musical creation and this DVD is a gift given for fans of Collins solo career. If you prefer Genesis songs and you would like to enjoy a real good Genesis concert, get \\"The way we walk\\" concert DVD or \\"Live in Wembley\\".  <br /> <br />This one offers a great retrospective of Phil Collins best songs from his beginning as a solo artist to his recent album. Everything is there ! His live performance is stunning considering he his half deaf. The band on the stage is incredible with a dozen of musicians. Visual effects are pretty good too.  <br /> <br />Daryl S., the guitarist, offers very good guitar solos and Chester T., the second drummer, has good respect for Collins interpretations on percussions. Sound recording as well as filming are both nearly perfect.  <br /> <br />My only complain is about the featurettes, boring I think. But Collins isn't a cheap guy, he personally supervised the production of the concert film on DVD. Generous, he provides us with all the videos from the songs on the concert setlist in addition to the Live Aid performance of \\"Agains all odds\\" and a few other extras.  <br /> <br />Overall, hours of great Phil Collins plus a photo gallery and wonderful live show !
B0002S947K|5.0|I bought this album for the title track, but I have loved it more with each listen.  Ray Lamontagne has a beautiful, soulful voice.   <br />I also agree that this would be a great makeout album...or just perfect for summer nights.
B00006RG9K|5.0|I love concerts on DVD and this is one of my favorite. The live performance by Phil Collins, Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks with the participation of two talented musicians is stunning.  <br /> <br />All songs are played with respect to the original recording. From oldies on a rock mix including a few hits from albums of the 70s with Peter Gabriel to great songs from the 80s like Invisible Touch, Home By The Sea, Tonight Tonight, and then new songs from that time (best of We Can't Dance album is played on the setlist, including No Son Of Mine, Driving The Last Spike, Fading Lights, Dreaming While You Sleep, etc.)  <br /> <br />Please, old Genesis fan with no respect for Mr. Collins talents as a vocalist, listen to his interpretation of songs from Gabriel's time as lead vocal. It is very good ! Collins sings with a lot of emotions on this concert film. Same thing for the good playing by other musicians. With the good multi-angle feature, which is on of the best available on a live DVD, you can enjoy a global angle as well as individual performances. At least 2 angles are available at all time, well chosen for each song, and most of the songs offer 4 angles to choose from.  <br /> <br />Extras could have been better, but 4 angles and a commentary track on a over-two-hour concert uses a lot of space. Still, there are a few interviews available. They consist of questions asked individually to the three members of the band. <br /> <br />My only complain is the sound recording on the DVD, which is not loud enough. You need a good amp to enjoy the maximum of it. With a good sound system and quite high quality headphones, I was satisfied. Picture is nice, and menus are great.  <br /> <br />You can view a map of the stage from which you can see where are located cameras of different angles for different songs, so you know for example that # 3 on No Son Of Mine is spotted on Tony Banks playing keyboards. <br /> <br />Overall, if you like Genesis music, from Gabriel's period or newer songs, this is a terrific DVD to had to your collection with hours of viewing for a good price value.
B000002LRX|5.0|Just another 5 star review for a record I've been loving for over a decade now. Small Victories is still one of my favorite songs of all time, and many other tracks are in my top 100 easily. Too bad their guitarist had to pass away. I think they could have been the biggest band in rock today. Insanely good live as well, so find some bootlegs. Faith No More, as good a group as any of the 90's.
B00006879E|1.0|These guys make clay aiken look like the toughest mo foe' around. How anyone could force themselves to listen to a bunch of wiggers doing r&b that would make the likes of \\"raven symone\\" cringe is beyond me. I guess it's this talentless hip-hop explosion (which will die out soon, trust me), that's got everyone excited about a middle-of-the-road, nothing special cheeze pop band. They have huge egos too, ones that would make kanye west green with envy. Total garbage, and if you call this rock, you deserve to be shot.
B00004UEDQ|4.0|I watched this movie and Clean and Sober the same evening. What a difference. This movie was excellent and realistic.<br /><br />The characters portrayed in this film were interesting.  We learned a lot in a short amount of time.  We SAW the characters getting healthier, learning to live, learning to live without drugs and alcohol. . . .they grew right in front of us (unlike in Clean and Sober).<br /><br />Sandra Bullock played Gwen perfectly.  Elizabeth Perkins, in a smaller role, played her sister just as perfectly.  The viewer gets to see both of them heal. . . although Elizabeth Perkins' character isn't alcoholic, her life is also a struggle, and their closure is believable and warm.<br /><br />Gwen has tough choices to make, and the ending is upbeat and positive, but absolutely credible.  We see her preparing for these choices throughout the movie.
630514415X|4.0|After producing mediocre stuff like Crooklyn and Bamboozled in the mid-1990s, Spike Lee rebounded strongly in 1998 with He Got Game. This was easily Lee's best film since Malcolm X in 1992.  <br /> <br />At first, moviegoers may be inclined to think that He Got Game will be little more than a slam-dunk fest that will showcase the athletic talent of its lead actor, Ray Allen (one of the NBA's premier players). Truth be told, however, He Got Game is more a sentimental drama than a sports movie, and the film focuses primarily on the behind-the-scenes pressures, temptations, and betrayals that often confront athletes as they are recruited by major universities or establish their professional careers.  Spike Lee does a nice job of poignantly depicting the complex issues of money, sex, groupies, and greedy agents who prey on aspiring young athletes. <br /> <br />Although not a professional actor, Ray Allen does a splendid job in his role as Jesus Shuttlesworth - a high school senior who is faced with the difficult, high-pressure decision of which college he will attend the following fall. Denzell Washington delievers a spectacular performance as always, this time playing Jesus's father (Jake Shuttlesworth) who is serving a prison sentence for involunarity killing his wife. His mother's accidental death fuels Jesus's intense hatred for his father, but now his father is under pressure from the state governor to persuade Jesus to play basketball for the governor's alma mater. If Jesus agrees to do so, the governor has agreed to commute Jake's sentence. The beautiful Rosario Dawson is quite convincing as Jesus's gold-digging girlfriend with ulterior motives. <br /> <br />Fans of Spike Lee's films will notice several of Spike's regulars returning in cameo appearances in He Got Game, including John Turturro, Lonetta McKee, and Bill Nunn. Basketball personalities such as Dick Vitale, John Thompson, and Rick Fox also appear in the film, adding a sense of realism to the plot. <br/> <br />Much more than a simple basketball film, He Got Game tackles issues of race, class, exploitation, and family relationships. Interestingly enough, Spike Lee employs much more sex in this film than he usually does - porn star Heather Hunter appears in a cameo and Rosario Dawson delivers a sex scene of her own. The most graphic sex scene involves a menage-a-trois between Jesus and two blonde groupies during a recruiting visit to a prospective college. <br /> <br />Ultimately, Jesus discovers that the man he hates most is the cares most for him. Jake does not exploit his son, nor does he manipulate Jesus for personal gain.  <br /> <br />He Got Game is a sentimental drama that should appeal to any sports fan, and the acting is complemented by a great soundtrack. Unfortunately, the DVD lacks extras - only a theatrical trailer is provided. An interview with the director or Ray Allen (discussing real-life experiences with the issues dealt with in the film) would have been a great addition.
B00004XQP4|5.0|This is Green Day's second greatest album (behind Insomniac), Each song with the exception of Macy's Day Parade is awesome. I am a Green day fan not because of the songs that get played on the radio but because they are one of the few bands that make a Cd without any filler. Some of their best work never gets played like my favorite song of theirs \\"Castaway\\"    To any younger listeners who have an adult preview the CD before it is bought, this is a very clean album not just for Green Day but for anyone. This Cd will swear 3 times (Once in Blood, Sex, and Booze and twice in Minority).    This is a great CD
0800179501|4.0|At one time in our lives, most of us have had to confront bullies or we have known someone who had to confront a bully - especially if you are male. Bullying is probably as old as schools themselves are, and who has not wanted to see the schoolyard bully get his come-uppance by getting whipped in front of everyone? <br /> <br />One of the most under-rated movies of the 1980s, The Karate Kid follows the trials and tribulations of Daniel LaRusso, an Italian-American high school student from New Jersey, as he moves across the country with his mother to Los Angeles after his mother obtains a career promotion. However, life is not all fun in the sun for Daniel. His new romantic interest is the ex-girlfriend of a black belt who is ring-leader or a ruthless gang of martial arts bullies. Daniel finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time on more than one occassion, until he is rescued by Miyagi - an elderly Okinawan immigrant who is the maintenance man for Daniel's apartment complex. Miyagi teaches Daniel lessons in self-defense and in life, and the two soon develop a father-son type relationship. <br /> <br />The Karate Kid is often compared to Rocky (1976), which should come as no big surprise, since John G. Avildsen directed both films. Both The Karate Kid and Rocky feature an ethnic, blue-collar protagonist who is down on his luck and faces seemingly insurmountable odds. Both films have great cinematagraphy, making great use of Philadelphia and Southern California locales. And both films employ a \\"root-for-the-underdog\\" formula. <br /> <br />However, The Karate Kid also addresses issues of economics and class as Daniel encounters social barriers while trying to date the daughter of wealthy WASP elites \\"from the Hills.\\" Ali's parents seem less than enthusiastic about their daughter dating someone from across the tracks. <br /> <br />The DVD version of the film is presented in full-screen format, but other than this, the picture quality is decent and the sound quality is not bad. Unfortunately, few extras are found on the DVD. The only extras are trailers for the first three Karate Kid movies. The case, however, contains a fold-out pamphlet that discusses the production of the Karate Kid in 1984. If you are a hardcore Karate Kid fan, you will have to purchase the new boxed set collector's edition.
0156027321|5.0|I began Pi enjoying the beautiful prose and the young man's drive for religion.  I was disappointed as some reviewers have commented before at the book after the ship sinks.  The prose does become sparse and gruesome, but so is the fate of young Pi.  However the last chapter reveals the true magic of the novel.  I did believe in God or at least the powers of a higher being to bring about a peace in Pi that seemed unfathomable after his experience.  It is a book that I wanted to go back to after finishing and left me with a desire to begin all over again.  It is not a perfect novel, but it does draw you in and leave you with deeper thoughts long after the book is over.  For me that constitutes a great novel.
B00006EXL5|5.0|I've had this C.D. for quite a while..but I just now got into reading all of these reviews and things. M.C.R....since they are probably my favorite band of all time, I think I should review every song on both of their C.D.'s. This one first. =) I feel that Bullets is MUCH better than Three Cheers. And there isn't a lot of people who agree with that. 'Bullets'is some of My Chemical Romance's darker, heavier stuff. I think that this C.D. represents the band a lot better than 'Three Cheers'. This was M.C.R.'s first C.D., (I'm sure you know that >_&lt;) And it was before they became mainstream. >___&lt; Now that fame has hit them...their music is changing...this will always be my favorite album. <br /> <br />1. Romance - 9/10. Wow!! Are you listening to this?!?! The guitar is amazing! Although there isn't any words, the melodies speak for themselves. <br /> <br />2. Honey this mirror isn't big enough for the two of us - 10/10. This song is a MASTERPIECE! I didn't really understand this song fully until I saw the video. I LOVE this song. I just do. There isn't any way around it. <br /> <br />3. Vampires will never hurt you - 10/10. What can I say? Gerard Way is a miracle worker. This song is brilliant and beautiful. It makes me think of Gerard with fangs...Grr...o_o. One of my favorites. <br /> <br />4. Drowning Lessons - 9/10. The only reason I gave that a 9/10 is because I've been giving out too many 10/10's and I need to save those...O___o. This is a GREAT song. I love love love love love love love it. I love the line 'I never thought it'd be this way, just me and you we're here alone, and if you stay, all I'm asking for is....a thousand bodies piled up, I never thought would be enough to show you just what I've been thinking.' This is an awesome song. <br /> <br />5. Our Lady of Sorrows - 10/10. Oh man. There are so many good things I could say about this song. o_o It is just like....UGH! It is so great, I'm out of words to describe it! I love the lyrics. Sometimes Iwonder if Gerard is like....a superhero. O_o Haha. He is just so great, he can't be human!! <br /> <br />6. Headfirst for Halos - 10/10. Ok..I'm seriously not giving every song 10/10 on purpose...or just because I love M.C.R. I'm grading by what the song deserves. And this song....ohhhh boy. It's like my favorite. The drums in the beginning are so...RAWR! Then it goes in to a fast paced frenzy...you would think it would be about something happy, but no. It's about suicide. You find that out later in the song with '..I think I'll blow my brains against the ceiling.' That shocked me at first. But once you listen to the whole song, and pay attention to all of the lyrics, you can see what they are trying to say. I love lovelvoelvoeleolvoe this song to death. <br /> <br />7. Skylines and Turnstiles - 9/10. Not my favorite song on the C.D. I still think it deserves a top rating though. I love the lyrics. I just don't like the tune of Gerard's voice in that song. O_o It just doesnt sound like it fits some of the time. His voice is still unbelieveably gorgeous, but it's just not the greatest in this song. There are certain parts in this song that I REALLY like though. <br /> <br />8. Early sunsets over Monroeville - 10/10. Don't even get me started on this song, guys. Wow. When I first got the C.D., I skipped over this song. Don't ask me what possessed me to skip it. It is just a really slow and well...slow song. I heard the beginning of it and I was like...nah...maybe later. But it as turned out to be my favorite. Yep. I made up my mind. This song is my favorite. It's AMAZING. <br /> <br />9. This is the best day ever - 9/10. This isn't one of my absolute favorite songs, however, I LOVE the way it starts out for some reason or another....I dunno. Maybe I should've given this a 10/10...I really love it...Nah. I'm lazy..>_&lt; <br /> <br />10. Cubicles - 10/10. I wont even get into why I love this song so much.....It would take me nearly forever. >_&lt; 'But you don't workhere anymore...it's just a vacant 3x4...' *sings* O__o excuse me. <br /> <br />11. Demolition Lovers - 10/10. WOWNESS!!! This is one of my favorites from the C.D. It just sounds so sweet and sincere. Gerard sounds so sad. =( But that's what makes this song SO awesome. I seriously love this song....ohhhhh do I love this song. <br /> <br />So...that pretty much sums it up! =) I cherish this C.D. like I cherish my life. It's seriously THAT great. If all my belongings were taken from me...but I got to keep one...I'd definitley take 'Bullets' It's just that great. I love My Chemical Romance. =) Those boys have no clue what they mean to me. =) I looove them. And all of you people just checking out the band because they are becoming mainstream....just don't. They werent meant to be a mainstream band. =( M.T.V...LEAVE OUR BOYS ALONE!! PLEASE!! <br /> <br />&lt;3 xonthecontraryx
B00005JNJT|4.0|It's still early in the summer movie season, but so far two beloved-but-ailing film franchises have gotten radical, much-needed reboots. <br /> <br /> Barely a month after the Star Wars saga wrapped itself up with a worthy finale, \\"Batman Begins\\" arrives and it, too, renews a series many had written off. <br /> <br /> There have been four previous \\"Batman\\" movies in the past two decades: Tim Burton's \\"Batman\\" and \\"Batman Returns\\" were wry, stylish epics but they got hijacked by colorful villains who stole the show from the hero. By contrast, director Joel Schumacher's follow-ups (\\"Batman Forever\\" and \\"Batman and Robin\\") were Day Glo affairs too campy to take seriously. <br /> <br /> But \\"serious\\" is definitely the operative word for this fifth, latest and best entry. <br /> <br /> Writer-director Christopher Nolan (\\"Memento\\") rejuvenates the Batman legend by first unveiling a chapter the other movies avoided - the story of just how the Caped Crusader got his cape in the first place. <br /> <br /> Origins are always the best parts of superhero movies (think of young Clark Kent racing trains in \\"Superman,\\" or Spiderman coming into his own as a webslinger) and this \\"Batman\\" begins with as tall as tale as a comic book fan could want: <br /> <br /> After a mugger's bullets leave billionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) an orphan, he dedicates his life to fighting crime. His quest leads him to Asia, where he learns martial arts from a terror squad called the League of Shadows and has to face some tough dilemmas about the divide between justice and vengeance.  <br /> <br /> Upon his return to Gotham City, Wayne uses his wealth to become Batman with the aid of his trusty butler, Alfred (Michael Caine), and his Q-like weapons designer, Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman); Fox's Batmobile is one of the movie's coolest touches. <br /> <br /> But Bats has barely even hung out his superhero shingle before he spots bad guys on the horizon: A powerful gangster whose vast network corruptsthe city; a masked menace called The Scarecrow whose weapons give his victims terrifying hallucinations; and a murkier, more ominous threat from Wayne's past. <br /> <br /> This is clearly a comic book movie aimed at older fans and Nolan plays everything very, very straight, despite the fact that this is also still a story of a guy who runs around alleys in tights and pointy ears. <br /> <br /> Nolan's gritty, realistic vibe usually works, though, and it's aided by assured turns from some of the best actors around: Bale (definitely the most anguished of the Batmen), Caine, Freeman, Liam Neeson, Cillian Murphy and Gary Oldman, who can now add \\"Commissioner Gordon\\" to an acting resume that includes Beethoven, Sid Vicious and Lee Harvey Oswald. <br /> <br /> And though the movie's deadly serious tone prevents it from winking (which is good) it also robs it of a lot of the giddy fun of most comic book films - Batman may fly by night but by day Wayne is covered in bruises.  <br /> <br /> In fact, as with the latest \\"Star Wars\\" movie, this is a joltingly grim adventure, a far spookier outing than most PG-13 films. While that edge will be exactly what most fans of the Dark Knight ordered, viewers in the Happy Meal demographic may find the movie's intensity and adult themes rough going.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Normally I'd try to write something literal and cohesive to describe the assets of movie I appreciated seeing. Unfortunately I just came out of a theater showing Christopher Nolan's \\"Batman Begins\\" and that's not going to happen. <br /> <br />Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. <br /> <br />Go for other reviews for in-depth analysis of this person's performance or the script's cohesiveness or the breathtaking quality of the cinematography. I'm keeping it simple. It freaking rocks. <br /> <br />I feel like I just rode the best rollercoaster at the fair, and now I can't wait to use the rest of my ride tickets to do the same rollercoaster over and over again. It's been years since an action movie elicited this kind of excitment from me and it feels great. <br /> <br />Will someone please buy George Lucas a ticket to this movie, so he can see how it's done? <br /> <br />This is what movie theaters were made for. Go see it right now. Awesome. <br /> <br />(Is it too early, on opening day, to predict that this movie will be the hands-down blockbuster of 2005? And furthermore, who's ready to go again?) <br /> <br />As a lifelong Batman fan, at 36 I can say that Batman has finally been captured on film. There's one Batman, and his name is Christian Bale. There's one Batman movie, and it's called \\"Batman Begins.\\" Nothing else is remotely in the same league.  <br /> <br />Someone get Christopher Nolan on the sequel right now....
B0006399FS|3.0|I hope you'll be indulgent with me on this review, written by a very long time u2 fan. I started out trying to write a very balanced review but I ended up getting more and more bummed out by the tack that u2 has taken. So, if you're not into an arcane analysis of u2 the band, you might want to skip my review. If you're new to u2, may I just suggest that you might want to own all of the following before this album:<br /><br />1. Achtung Baby, 2. War, 3. Joshua Tree, 4. Zooropa, 5. Pop, 6. Boy, 7. October, 8. The Unforgettable Fire, 9. Rattle and Hum 10. Live under a Blood Red Sky<br /><br />The u2 and music fans in me say this album is horrible. The pragmatist in me points out that it is not that bad, really. I don't see how you can rave about the album with a straight face but it's hardly the end of the world. (Or the rest of the epic Achtung Baby, either.) I will be the last person in the world to criticize people for feeling passionate about music, but it's just an album. No one takes u2 to be cutting edge anymore, so there's no harm in people enjoying this album. If it makes you happy, great. For me, I think this is one of u2's worst albums, although better than ATYCLB by a measure. It is serviceable pop, and that to me makes it worse: a band like u2 should fail spectacularly in the pursuit of greatness, not turn out timid but unimpeachable pop.<br /><br />Why is it not very good? The songs mostly lack animation. They don't go anywhere. Contrast any given song, Vertigo and Love Peace or Else aside, with Sunday Bloody Sunday with its three distinct shifts in tempo and mood and you'll see what I mean. There is nothing new here. No interesting sounds, no experimentation, no recreation, not even creation. It is the first u2 album that consciously emulates its predecessor.<br /><br />To argue this point I have to get into serious u2 fan dementia:<br /><br />The juvenile pop of Boy was followed by the wildly experimental October which was in turn followed by the more mature rock of War, which was followed by another experimental and atmospheric album in the Unforgettable Fire. Fire was followed by The Joshua Tree, a truly beautiful and evocative effort, which was followed (kind of) by Rattle and Hum and then properly by Achtung Baby, which completely melted down and reforged u2's sound, creating one of the best albums of all time. Personally, I'd have been happy with a dozen Achtung Babys, but u2 immediately danced off into another direction with Zooropa, which was far more electronic and weird than any of their previous albums. Finding commercial success with that despite themselves, they returned with Pop. Here is where the story turns sad. Despite an enthusiastic reception in Europe, Americans just didn't get the brilliant but erratic Pop. U2 clearly felt chastened by this rejection and followed Pop with the pedestrian ATYCLB. From the perspective of a u2 fan, this is when disaster struck: massive critical and popular acceptance of the tired ATYCLB retread. However, we comforted ourselves with the knowledge of the pattern of u2 records: conventional and massively popular album followed by edgy and interesting album. Alas, the pattern was broken with HTDAAB.<br /><br />The subtext to this is also the rise and fall of u2's rhythm section. Achtung Baby, Zooropa, and Pop was Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen, jr. unleashed. ATYCLB and HTDAAB is them neutered.<br /><br />With a bit of luck, u2 will get bored of this brand of pop music, Bono will quit galivanting around the globe in pursuit of admirable causes, and Larry and Adam will tell the twangy two to get with the program. Otherwise, the next u2 album might be the first I don't rush to buy.ature rock of War, which was followed by another experimental and atmospheric album in the Unforgettable Fire.

B0009HLDFU|3.0|It is my opinion that since the release of their debut in the early '90s, the Foo Fighters have been on a steady decline in their ability to make unbelievably great rock music. Their debut was easily one of the best CDs to come out of the '90s; The Colour & The Shape was a near-perfect, rock solid follow-up that fittingly put them on the map; TINLTL produced a couple of gems while leaving us wanted a bit more; and One By One was equally as maddening to listen to, as understood by Mr. Grohl himself. Oddly enough, the Foo's appeal matched with Dave Grohl's charm grew with each album and took them from supposed Nirvana rip-offs to one of the most popular acts on MTV. And not just rock acts either; the other night I watched about 10 minutes of the MTV movie awards and caught the Foo Fighters being introduced like they were a re-united Beatles group (and by beautiful celebrities, no less). But that's MTV for you. So with all that being said, I went into this hoping for the best, but expecting a pretty average album.<br /><br />What I got was indeed sometimes average, while sometimes brilliant and sometimes wearisome. The double disc--1 rock/1 acoustic--idea is cool. I have always felt that Dave Grohl has a great voice for slow songs (e.g. \\"Tired Of You\\", the acoustic version of \\"Disenchanted Lullaby\\" on the Have It All single), while he's equally as efficient at letting out the occasional rock and roll scream. This album is thus the best of both worlds, really, although you have to change discs when you want to change pace.<br /><br />Between the two, the acoustic disc is certainly the best. The rock portion is good, but none of the songs distinguish themselves as timeless or classic, even though there isn't a bad song to be found. Without question, you could pick any track and say \\"that's the next single\\" and no one could argue against it. Some of the acoustic numbers, I think, are what keep this record from falling below the likes of One By One and TINLTL. \\"Miracle\\" seems to be the talked-about song here, with its beautiful violin and superb lyrics, although I'd say gems like \\"Still\\", \\"Virginia Moon\\" (with Norah Jones) and \\"Razor\\" (with QOTSA's Josh Homme on guitar) are the premiere, stand-out tracks. The remaining six (much like with the first disc) are just as good, but there are some moments when if Dave wasn't or isn't singing that you could mistake the songs for elevator music.<br /><br />The final verdict for In Your Honor, compared with everything the Foo Fighters have done, is that it's still very ordinary and average. Compared with most of the music being played on the radio and MTV, rather, this is an excellent release. Because there's 20 tracks (approx. 83 minutes) and a good balance between rock and acoustic, is outdoes their preceding two albums, while it doesn't even come close to the level of their debut or The Colour & the Shape. And I'm beginning to consider the fact no Foo Fighters' album ever will.e\\" seems to be the talked-about song here, with its beautiful violin and superb lyrics, although I'd say gems like \\"Still\\", \\"Virginia Moon\\" (with Norah Jones) and \\"Razor\\" (with QOTSA's Josh Homme on guitar) are the premiere, stand-out tracks.

B000001DTM|5.0|Achtung Baby is a great album because each song stands on its own feet and yet it is an incredibly coherent album and not simply a collection of songs. From the intricate orchestration of Zoo Station to the sublimely mournful organs on Love is Blindness, the album moves from strength to strength.<br /><br />Zoo Station is a statement song, a radical departure from anything that U2 had done up until that point, with incredible attention to detail in the orchestration and lyrics.<br /><br />Even better than the Real Thing employs soaring guitars & vocals. Truly an exuberant song.<br /><br />One is arguably U2's best song and it will almost certainly be U2's contribution to the inevitable retrospective on the music of the late 20th century that we'll see some time in the next twenty years or so. Absolute lyrical genius in this song:<br /><br />it's too late/ tonight / to drag the past / out into the light<br /><br />we're one but we're not the same /we gotta carry each other / carry each other<br /><br />which is married to a beautiful melody and subdued notes.<br /><br />Until the End of the World is one of the darker songs on the album. It envokes a particular scene, Bono at a party flirting with someone who can't keep the gloom and doom out of the conversation. Just as we are about to dismiss the person, Bono flips the script and sings about how he \\"took the money, I spiked your drink...\\" suddenly it's a song about Judas's betrayal of Christ and Bono is Judas? Whoa. Yeah, the Apocalypse is kind of a drag at a dinner party.<br /><br />Who's gonna ride your wild horses is one of the most bittersweet songs you'll ever hear. Perfect tone of romantic loss, longing, and tenderness all in one.<br /><br />So Cruel is my least favorite song on the album, which is heresy in some circles. I don't care for it because despite its powerful lyrics it is too much of a dirge. While it eventually gets going at the end, it plods along for far too long. While it might be a career highlight for some bands, for U2 and especially for Achtung Baby,  it's a lowlight.<br /><br />The Fly and Mysterious Ways are excellent and iconic classics, both are seductive and, well, mysterious, with Bono's whispery vocals in The Fly setting off the jangly guitar and down tempo drums and bass. Mysterious Ways is more playful and emotive, a classic that has been so overplayed that you have to strain to hear the minor keys.<br /><br />Trying to throw your arms around the world, Ultraviolet, and Acrobat are a trimuverate of longing and mixed up emotions. Ultraviolet declares that \\"you light my way / ultraviolet\\" which of course is outside the visible band of light. Acrobat laments \\"I must be an acrobat / to talk like this / and act like that.\\" Trying to throw your arms around the world is a beautifully low key song that on many albums would be the absolute pinnacle of perfection. Here it plays merely a supporting role.<br /><br />Love is blindness is the perfect somber close to the album. The emotions are still mixed, but surrender to the unknowability of the mysteries of love is the theme. The organ is beautiful.<br /><br />U2 fans discussing which of the band's albums are the best bring to mind the old saw that if you ask five socialists what socialism is you'll get six different definitions. I once knew someone who swore blind that October was the pinnacle of U2's creative efforts and everything thereafter was hopelessly tarnished and corrupt. Devotees of The Joshua Tree will express similar sentiments. For my part, I think this album represents U2's best work, but I consider Zooropa and Pop, which follow it, to be very, very excellent albums as well.ight be a career highlight for some bands, for U2 and especially for Achtung Baby,  it's a lowlight. <br /> <br />The Fly and Mysterious Ways are excellent and iconic classics, both are seductive and, well, mysterious, with Bono's whispery vocals in The Fly setting off the jangly guitar and down tempo drums and bass.

B000026FOA|5.0|I agree with most of the comments here and don't think I can add much to what's been said about the music on this astonishing debut. <br /> <br />I would like to point out, however, that there is a second - and more haunting - 'take' on the title (ref: Kids Review dated 3 April 2005). <br /> <br />I read Patrick Humphries' Drake biography a few years ago and he did mention the reference to the warning on cigarette paper packets that there are only 'five leaves left'. He also referred to a poem, which described the illness of a sick boy, who spent his dying days stuck indoors, staring at a dying plant, which had five leaves left on it. As the boy's condition worsens, the leaves come off one by one as a direct (if over-simplified) metaphor. When the boy dies, all the leaves are gone. <br /> <br />Drake was an avid poetry reader at Cambridge, and it's possible that the album references this poem. If it does, it adds even more poignancy to an already stark work of music, given Drake's untimely death.
B00005JNJT|5.0|The best movie adaptation of batman ever made.I found the film realistic, believable and human. Actually I did not want it to end.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|In Your Honor is the foo fighters' greatest album to date. with 90% of the CDs out there, there are only about 3 songs worth listening to. In your honor is the exception. every song on this album is AMAZING! With the acoustic disc, there is something for any one. the best album of the year so far. <br /> <br />P.S. Stop rating this CD 1 star just because you can't get past the copy protection. A retarded blind monkey with no arms could get past it.
B0006L16N8|1.0|Well why do you suppose this is such disappointingly dull commercial sap? Is it just genetics? Or the result of large egos, large checks and no talent? Either way it presents us with a valid case for abortion.
B00000K3D4|1.0|I found this movie to actually be extremely dissapointing.  The characters well very under-developed, the plot was sketchy and immensely flawed.  I seriously thought of BURNING it after I watched it, but I had to return it to Blockbuster.  The singing was actually pretty funny, yet excruciatingly obnoxious.  The first song that David Bowie sang was stuck in my head for 3 days.  I had nightmares about the poor quality of the puppets, and lived in fear of being forced to watch this movie again.  Then, I was forced to watch it on an airplane, and started looking for parachutes.  Seeing I could not find one, I locked myself in the bathroom for the duration of the flight.  Please, I beg of you, do not show this at social gatherings, unless you want to be TPed.  Just buy The Stand, Cujo, or It instead. <br /> <br />-Pennywise the Dancing Clown
B0002S94OS|5.0|Shadows Fall aside, Lamb of God had to be the most popular band in 2003 that was not signed to a major label. Both Shadows Fall and Lamb of God developed a large underground fan base, but, in 2004, Lamb of God were the only band to jump to the major leagues.<br /><br />When some bands get signed to a major label, they are forced to add more melody to their music or make radio-friendly songs to help boost album sales (some would argue this happened to AFI). Some bands (i.e. Pantera--who ditched hair metal) end up changing their sound entirely. Still more bands take advantage of the label's big budget and production, thus making the new C.D. very polished and expensive (like Korn's \\"Untouchables.\\") When Lamb of God inked a major record deal, they definitely did NOT do either of the first two things (add melody to their music or completely change their sound), and they only partially did the third (take advantage of the label's production).<br /><br />I believe Sony's mixing and production have made appearances on 2004's \\"Ashes of the Wake.\\" The result is an improved quality of vocals. On \\"As the Palaces Burn,\\" the guitars and drums were louder than the vocals, thus pushing frontman Randy Blythe to the back or the middle of the wall of sound. Don't get me wrong, I loved that album (I thought it was one of the best of 2003,) but on these songs, Blythe's vocals are level with the guitars and drums. Plus (I don't know if I should credit the production with this or not, but) Blythe's vocals are more interesting and diverse on this album. He still sounds like Cookie Monster most of the time, but here his voice fluctuates  and has more than one tone. In addition to some ascending and descending yells, he shrieks, growls, and even calmly mutters an occasional spoken word.<br /><br />It's a good thing that the vocals are more clear, because these lyrics are meaningful and somewhat intelligent. Randy bashes the President (even though he never name drops George Bush), war, government lies and hypocrisy, and corporations.<br /><br />\\"As the Palaces Burn\\" may have been just a bit more raw sounding than this album, but  this does not sound over polished by any means (something overproduction often does). Also, \\"Ashes of the Wake\\" doesn't forfeit any of the brutality that Lamb of God have made a name for themselves with. This C.D. is nothing short of  43 minutes of non-stop, intense, barely controlled and often brutal chaos. This quintet are the five most pissed off musicians to ever come from Virginia...and they're not afraid to show it. Guitarists Willie Adler and Mark Morton rip through each song with one fiery and crunchy guitar riff after another, and Randy belts out some ferocious death metal vocals. Meanwhile, drummer Chris Adler, who is at the root of the attack, goes from killer machine gun blasts to slow chugs (and often he does that in the same song). But this album isn't all brawn and no brains; most of these songs are full of several different rhythms and tempo/beat changes.<br /><br />\\"Laid to Rest,\\" is the opening track and the first single. Very fast, chugging riffs-which echo Pantera and Testament-run throughout this whole song, and, after the beginning spoken words, the vocals change to patented Randy Blythe vocals. The bridge near the end is a good tempo change, with bobbing riffs.<br />\\"Hourglass\\" has more fiery riffs, thumping snare drums, and a double bass which almost sounds like shots from a distant cannon. About twenty seconds in, the catchy beat pauses briefly, and Randy barks \\"Privilege the chosen view\\" a capella. This song continues to plow along, but it has subtle speed changes and, around the three minutes in, it becomes a stop-start rhythm.<br />\\"Now You've Got Something to Die For\\" is a lot speedier than tracks one and two. The beginning is a speedy groove with churning riffs, until the 50 second mark when a speed change kicks in and slows things down. The mid-section is a pounding rhythm with an ascending bellow, and the following verse has more fast chugging riffs. This song (particularly the chorus) is so catchy, it rings in your ears and rattles around your head forever.<br />\\"The Faded Line\\" begins by playing slower, rhythmic riffs over double kick drums. There's a creepy sounding guitar solo in this song, as well as a stop-start beat; but this song is a highlight because of the great, polyrhythmic drumming and ending shriek that Blythe lets out. (It sounds like he burned himself on a tea kettle.)<br />\\"Omerta\\" means \\"honor\\" in Italian. This song (track five) begins with a spoken word about \\"the rule of honor\\" (which I believe means, essentially, \\"kill or be killed.\\") It turns to a chugging beat with rhythmic riffs. Then, around the middle of the song, only one guitarist is playing (and is only audible in one headphone), but the drums and the other guitar kick in, and the song builds and gains density. Meanwhile, Randy is spouting lines like \\"A slip of the tongue, a slit of the throat...\\"<br />\\"Blood of the Scribe\\" is probably the song on this record with the most and the best tempo changes.<br />\\"One Gun\\" has another shriek, a running beat with pounding drums, and two mini guitar solos.<br />\\"Break You\\" has some more steam-rolling riffs, but this song is a highlight because part of it has high pitched shrieks which remind me of \\"New American Gospel.\\" A nice breakdown near the end, too, with bobbing riffs.<br />\\"What I've Become\\" opens with another running beat, with fast, interlocking riffs. About two and a half minutes in, the riffs become bobbing, then they seem to almost trade off riffs (take turns). And, around 2:55, Randy lets out a high, long yell, which lasts nearly ten seconds.<br />\\"Ashes of the Wake\\" is a personal favorite. The beginning and end of this song features a voice from what sounds like a CNN report, but this track is mostly an instrumental. It features some more complex, multi-limbed drumming, but the real highlight is the guest guitar work by ex-Megadeth axeman Chris Poland and Testament's Alex Skolnick. They lay down a combined total of five short but sweet guitar solos. (The fourth solo, which winds and bends, is probably my favorite of the bunch.)<br />The only relief comes with the ending track, \\"Remorse is for the Dead.\\" This song's light intro, which is soft, dwindling guitar chords, is so surprising, it's almost shocking. Don't fear, however, this song abruptly changes gears and goes full blast with the typical knock-out assault and staccato, stop-start riffing.<br /><br />Some say that the whole album plows along at one speed, but I disagree. I can see how the first time listener would think this, but Chris Adler's aforementioned ability to switch from machine gun attacks to slow chugs makes this album full of beat and tempo changes. Plus, such songs as \\"Laid to Rest\\" are mid-tempo compared to other numbers, like \\"Now You've Got Something to Die For.\\" And even if these songs were all one speed, this album wouldn't be the first to be like that. That's the way thrash-metal is! If you don't believe me, you haven't heard Megadeth's classic \\"Rust in Peace.\\"<br /><br />It may also appear to the first time listener that this C.D. is monotonous. But if you listen to their C.D.'s more than once, I guarantee it will grow on you and become very addicting. I used to think their music needed some texture and maybe even a little melody. Well, for this album, Lamb of God added texture by making the vocals more diverse. And melody? If they added melody to their songs (i.e. make the verses heavy and the choruses melodic, or vise versa), they would be just like any other popular metal band right now. The constant heaviness, plus the persistent double bass drumming and Cookie Monster vocals, make this band stand out from other New Wave of American Heavy Metal bands.<br /><br />The only flaw I can find in this album is that Randy Blythe's vocals are very one-dimensional. He is constantly angry (that's the only emotionhe uses). Other than that, this C.D. is perfect, from front to back. This is essential listening for fans of thrash, metalcore, New Wave of American Heavy Metal, death metal, and/or fans who are new to those genres. Actually, it's essential listening for any metalhead! If enjoy any kind of heavy music (except rap-core), you should find \\"Ashes of the Wake\\" to your liking.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a great album, easily one of the best of 2004, and Lamb of God are one of the few bands who jumped to a major label without selling out. \\"Ashes of the Wake\\" proves they are still as catchy, contagious, addictive, brutal, and all around great as they ever were.

0670033375|4.0|A very interesting book -- and one that, if people can get past its somewhat daunting length, contains a lot of wisdom. It's easy in this high-tech age to look back at the Maya, the inhabitants of Easter Islands, and other civilizations that have done themselves in through overpopulation and overall ecological misjudgment and say, \\"That can't happen to us. We'd see it coming and do something about it.\\" In truth, though, I think civilizations all balance on a knife edge, and an ecological catastrophe can push them over that edge -- a drought, an earthquake, land that has been grazed or cultivated to exhaustion. We drive from our climate-controlled homes or offices to the grocery store where an abundance of foods unequaled in history awaits us -- and we don't realize how easily the system could fall apart. \\"Collapse,\\" while overlong and a bit windy at times, is an important book. Doubtless the Maya thought their civilization was impregnable, too.
B00003CXA6|5.0|What can I add that the other reviewers didn't say?  I have <br />watched this film numerous times and I never get tired of it. <br />The scene where Col Chamberlain leads the 20th Maine in the bayonet charge at Little Round Top literally brings tears to my eyes-such valour, such courage!  A Union officer once said that Pickett's Charge was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen.  This film allows us to see it ourselves (of course we can never feel the dread and excitement the Union troops felt as they saw the Confederate line approaching!) <br />While there are many fine performances, I find Tom Berringer as General Longstreet the most engaging.  Here is a man who was at best ambivalent about the whole war (he tells the British observer that the South should have freed the slaves before they fired on Ft Sumter) and strongly opposed to the attack at Gettysburg, yet his strong sense of duty and loyalty to General Lee prodded him on to planning and carrying out an attack that he knew would be a disaster.  Similarly, it is known that Robert E Lee himself was not enthusiastic about slavery or succession, yet he states that he could not fight against his native Virginia.  We, today, can not relate to the motivations and loyalties that drove these men.  Lee has been considered, at least in the South, a saintly figure and they show the love his men had for him, yet the film portrays him as a complex figure.  He states that he \\"enjoys\\" the war (he once said \\"it is good that war is so horrible lest we grow too fond of it\\") and he thinks nothing of sending thousands of his men to their deaths, but we also see him deeply affected by the casualties.  We also see his overconfidence which blinds him to the true nature of the situation he finds himself in.  Some officers who fail him he treats gently (those who failed to capture the two Round Tops), but JEB Stuart he chews out for disappearing at a crucial moment (Stuart says there \\"were reasons\\" for his absence but they are not explained in the film). <br />One minor defect of the film is that the Union commander General Meade is barely seen and so we really don't get an idea of how Lee's Union counterpart played his hand. It is known that President Lincoln was very unhappy that Meade didn't pursue Lee and attempt to destroy the Army of Northern Virginia during its retreat back to the Potomac River. It would have been interesting to show how Meade justified his lack of action (he probably felt the army was too exhausted and feared a Lee counter-attack). <br />In short, this film, in addition to \\"A Bridge Too Far\\" are the finest large-scale battle films ever produced.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Batman Begins is such a good, involving film, it almost renders all past film incarnations obsolete! The only one worth mentioning in a positive light from now on is Tim Burton's 1989 original-but I still liked this better.  <br />   Christian Bale is absolutely dead-on as Batman/Bruce Wayne! I remember being pleased with the news of his casting, but his performance exceeded my expectations. He nails both the intensity and the wry humor the character should always have, and he actually looks the part of both Bruce (handsome playboy) and Batty (physically intimidating, athletic). The supporting cast here is quite impressive (They actually support without taking away from the central character. Genius!). Michael Caine is actually better than the previous Alfred, which is saying a lot! Morgan Freeman is reliable as ever, as is Gary Oldman. Liam Neeson is also in fine form in what you initially think is an obvious prototype performance as the wise mentor. Even Katie Holmes comes off at least as good as Kirsten Dunst did in Spiderman. <br />   Other helpful attributes to this film are it's story, which thankfully takes the time to explain itself and, as a result, all the usual Batman myths become more than just convenient plot devices. Also, the tone of the movie just feels right. It's dark and serious when necessary, always edgy, and adds just the right amount of quirky winking humor at just the right times. This is probably due to Christopher Nolan's more-than-capable directing. He is a real talent and has yet to have a misstep in his short but impressive career. The music is typical Hans Zimmer material without much of a theme (not a criticism) and not very comic-book sounding a la Danny Elfman, but still evokes a since of legend and excitement. <br />   Overall, Batman Begins is a real summer treat! An entertaining film that rings true on just about every level. This lumbering franchise has been both redeemed and taken to new heights, and I for one can't wait to see how it unfolds this time in sequel form. As long as they keep the essential elements of this film intact, it should be a very enjoyable ride!
B00005JNJT|2.0|The Dark Knight returns?  Not like this.  Christopher Nolan's grand idea of putting Batman in a realistic setting has done nothing but stamp out the magic we used to feel.  Stripping a superhero and his world of their fantasy takes away something crucial: the film can't take us away with it.  It can't capture our imaginations.  Worse still, Nolan moves the film (and the editing) too quickly, and we can't absorb what we're seeing.  \\"Batman Begins\\" is a clunky, impersonal movie, devoid of any real soul, and woefully short on imagination.  Mostly to blame is Goyer's script, a collection of action movie cliches in the guise of a story.  It's so by-the-numbers that Batman could be replaced by any action hero; he's unnessecary in his own movie.  The same goes for the lead villain, Ra's al Ghul (Liam Neeson), who's stripped of everything that made his comic counterpart unique.  He isn't immortal, there's no Lazurus Pit,  not even Talia shows up.  Goyer transforms him into just another stock villain, blowing his chance to bring a character on par with the Joker to the silver screen.  The second villain, the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy), seems to have ben added as an afterthought, but we need him.  He picks up the slack.  Murphy is the only one doing anything of distinction.  He's genuinely creepy, and he fills the screen.  He's enough for a whole movie, but he barely gets any screentime, and he has so little to do with the story that he doesn't need to be there at all.  Most of the screen time is devoted to Christian Bale's Batman, but he's a complete blank (a faceless actor for a faceless character), and his Batman's been nuetered; the movie preaches like an evangelist to choose justice, not vengence.  But Batman's a creature of vengence.  And this movie's Batman works through his issues like a therapy patient, leaving him with no need for vigilance.  This movie is less faithful to the comic than anything you've ever seen: this isn't Batman, just a stale Superman in black.The first two movies transcended the comic book genre.  They had genuine artistry in them.  This film is nothing than typical action fare with a coat of black gloss, burdened with a flaccid lead and bit parts for its best actors.  This bat has no wings.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|I think their are too many SOAD fan-boys out there who gizz their pants over EVERY little thing they do. Just because they are probably one of the most talented and without a doubt ORIGINAL metal bands out there, doesn't mean everything they touch turns to gold.  <br /> <br />I listened to this album three times and basically found all the \\"hard\\" songs to be rather so-so. In fact, the only song that really stood out to me as a great song, was the last one.  <br /> <br />This was not the case with Self-titled and Toxicity. Where basically every freakin song stood. Even Steal this Album, I found to be mediocre except for a few exceptions. There was a reason that none of those songs made Toxicity:) <br /> <br />I hope the next half is better.
B00002E224|1.0|I just wanted to echo the negative reviews that have been posted so far. I saw no chemistry between the couple and the Ethan Hawke character really got on my nerves. It was a pointless waste of time watching two people (especially the girl) waste their whole evening and if I were the girl I'd have had to ditch him early on. He really seemed self-absorbed and needed to lighten up. I guess this stuff was supposed to be deep. But the dialogue seemed merely written by a shallow person imagining what depth might be and getting it wrong and sounding totally contrived.
B00004S35Z|5.0|stevie wonder's 1974 album 'fulfillingness first finale'is an album of musical ethereal beauty.it is also mixed with social and spiritual overtones,romantic love and classic seventies funk.wonder produced and arranged this album for his taurus productions,inc.(black bull music)'fulfillingness first finale'would be the fourth straight album in a row of which wonder would be working with his hired synthesizer comrades robert margouleff and malcolm cecil.this 1974 masterpiece was recorded at the record plant-L.A./media sound-new york/westlake audio-L.A./and jimi hendrix's legendary electric ladyland studios-new york.also on hand were the recordists joan decola and gary olazabal.4 me as a child of the sixties and the seventies when i grew a little older 2 appreciate music even more,i was awestruck by stevie wonder's musical genius.<br /><br />having been amazed by wonder's classic'innervisions'album the year before in 1973 as a 9 or 10 year old kid,'fulfillingness first finale'4 me brings back so many sweet memories when i was a child in elementary school.as is the tradition that is of music,an artist will release singles before the actual album is released.i and many other fans of wonder could not wait 4 the release of this album.but first things are first.it was those exciting 45 single discs!i remember as a ten year old kid going on eleven when stevie released the funk singles from this album:'you haven't done nothin'and 'boogie on reggae woman'both of these 45 singles were singles that my sweet mother bought 4 me in which i still do have 2 this day.as a kid,i just completely wore out the grooves of these 45 singles til they were white!i still remember it like it was yesterday when my mother bought me the second single from the album,'boogie on reggae woman'-my mother thought that something was wrong with the needle on the beginning of the song.she actually thought that the needle was actually skipping from groove 2 groove on the 45 single.but that was the way stevie used that synthesizer effect on the song that caught my mother off guard'<br /><br />'fulfillingness first finale'is the first album that my mother bought 4 me on an 8 track tape (of which that i still have 2 this day.)(ah,if only the young folk of today could just understand how special those times were when musicians PLAYED and singers SANG.)i also have the original album on vinyl format and now on cd.when my mother bought me this album on a white plasic 8 track tape cartridge in late 1974, i was excited as a child could be.i was also amazed by the amazing cover illustration of this album which was done by artist bob gleason. the title of this album came 2 stevie in a dream.'smile please'the moderate upbeat opener of the album,is a song that so much expresses that when sadness or unhappiness takes over smiling is the answer.there is not much lyrical content in the song,but it's few key lines make the message worth while:'a smiling face is an earthlike star-a frown can't bring out the beauty that you are;don't mess your face up with bitter tears cause life is gonna be what it is-love within and you'll begin smiling-there are brighter days ahead'...<br /><br />the heavenly ethereal but spiritual 'heaven is 10 zillion light years away'is the first of the two spiritual songs on the album.(the other one is 'they won't go when i go')/'heaven is 10 zillion light years away'(my father's favorite cut on this album)(which also features paul anka,shirley brewer,larry latimer and stevie's ex-wife at the time the beautiful syreeta wright providing background vocals) with it's incredible melody has a message that is of the heavens and feeling the spirit of god while at the same time wonder addresses with biting stinging comentary in the song of which he addreses atheists:'for those who don't believe(in god)will never see the light'(institutional) racism done towards black people of which wonder cuts through the heart of the matter:'why must my color black make me a lessor man?'-'i thought this world was made for every man,he(god)loves us all'...'but in my heart i can feel it,feel his spirit'...wonder brilliantly mixed the wrong doings of man and heavenly enlightenment with this classic spiritual.<br /><br />'too shy to say'is the first slow cut on the album.the song is about sensual longing with his woman but is being shy about expressing his feelings 2 her in that he really loves her.this slow cut has a slight'country and western'vibe 2 it.on the song,wonder has the classic legendary motown bassist james jamerson on acoustic bass and'sneakey'pete on pedal steel guitar.'boogie on reggae woman'with it's laid back caribbean-reggae groove has wonder playing all of the instruments except the congas.in the song,wonder expresses his vocal 'drawl'4 his hot desire for a 'reggae woman' whom he spots on the dance floor...'i like to see you boogie right across the floor-i like to do it to you-til you holla for more'...the 'drawl'that stevie uses in his voice is funny and funky at the same.the deep heavy synthesized bass groove on this cut controls the rhythm of the funk.as the groove picks up more momentum,wonder asks us ''can i play?-CAN I PLAY???(stevie's classic harmonica playing with vocal and instrumental interplay takes the song over the top)-another funny memory about this cut reminds me of my father back in the day.whenever i would play this song, stevie would ask can i play?my father would playfully shout back NO!!!this groove is still funky after 30 years and will remain funky 4 ever...<br /><br />but 'creepin'(sorry luther vandross fans this is the original!)no matter how good the rest of this album is,'creepin'is my favorite cut on this album when i was a child and still is now that i'm an adult.for this cut,wonder returns back 2 his one man band persona.also for this track wonder has the beautiful minnie riperton providing her sweet sensual backing vocals in the song.the lyrics in this song 4 his lady are simply incredible:'when i'm sleep at night babaa,i feel those moments of ecstacy-when you sleep at night babaa i wonder do i creep into your dreams-or could it be i sleep alone in my fantasy....'oh love is so amazing-guess you will be stayin'-so let it be!that you always creep into my dreams...this classic dreamy technicolor slowjam is one 4 the ages.my special memory about this song was that when i was a ten or eleven year old kid back in the 5th grade when i was in elementary school,i would walk to school singing this song and thinking about the two girls in my class that i had a crush on.i had school boy dreams that i had married one of them.the first girl i had a crush on her name was donna and the other girl's name was robin.(even though i was 2 shy 2 express my feelings for either girl,it was only a puppylove fantasy.)ah,'creepin'was the jam back when i was a 10 or 11 year old kid and is still the jam now.<br /><br />'you haven't done nothin'is the album's most powerful cut and the first single release.as a kid i liked the song so much i begged my mother 2 buy the 45 single 4 me and she did.i remember playing this 45 everyday getting ready 4 school looking out the window and jamming 2 it by the windowpane.by playing the 45 single so much,i completely wore out the grooves 2 it until the single was damn near white!!!the song is stevie's vocal assault on the then so-called devil president richard 'TRICKY DICK'nixon.stevie's scathing assault on this bastard serves this devil right.wonder immediately cut thru the chase and and pulls no punches with no mercy blew this fool out the water with these scathing lyrics:'it's not to cool to be ridiculed,but you brought this upon yourself!'/'we would not care to wake up to the nightmare that's becoming real life...but when mislead who knows a person's mind can turn as cold as ice...'and we are sick and tired of hearing your song-tellin' how you are gonna change right from wrong-cause if you really want to hear our views,you haven't done nothin!'...stevie also has the group the jackson 5 harmonizing the doo doo wop background vocals in this scathing funk cut.<br /><br />'it ain't no use'is a moderate ballad about the end of a love affair between a man and a woman(with backing vocals provided by lani groves,minnie riperton and deniece williams).in the song,wonder describes that love's fire had burned out and the relationship cannot be saved,but still offered hope and redemption 4 the both of them 2 find love anew:'we still are young and both of us have time to find our winter love in spring'...of course by the song's end the breakup is official:'it ain't no use cause we done run out of juice'and he tells her:'so long baby,bye bye baby'...<br /><br />'they won't go when i go'is the second and final spiritual cut on the album.co-written with yvonne wright,the song is spiritually powerful with wonder's opening quiet piano intro.it would be almost a full minute until wonder began his serious spiritual vocals.in the song,wonder intones to us all that GOD wants us 2 steer away from those who are not of good and are of the evil persuasion.the song's key dramatic section when he states:'unclean minds mislead the pure/the innocent will leave for sure/for them there's a resting place/people sinning just for fun/they will never see the sun/for they can never show their faces/there ain't no room for the hopeless sinner/who will take more than he will give'...wonder's spiritual message is clear.there are those of us who want peace thru all eternity and there are those of us who do not.the final lyrics 2 this song completes it's message:'since my soul conceived/all that i believe/the kingdom i will see/cause they won't go when i go/and i'll go where i'll go /no one can keep me from my...DESTINY/they won't go WHEN I GO...4 me personally after hearing this spiritual cut no matter what one's spiritual affiliation is,you cannot helped but be moved by this classic,spiritual meditation piece.<br /><br />'bird of beauty'is a similar twin 2 'smile please'but is more musically vibrant.the song has an unusual beginning and is also sung in 2 different languages.it's message is for one to relax their mind when one is in stress.shirley brewer,lani groves and deneice williams provide exciting vocals 2 start the song off and they shine throughout the song.with free your mind lyrics,we all need time off and wonder delivers these time 2 relax sentiments:'simon says that now your mind desires a vacation/free it to join in fun and plenty recreation/there awaits you a ticket at ''please have a good time station''...these lyrics are for one 2 escape and to get away and let the mind and soul be free while at the same time wonder warns his listeners 2 enjoy life but leave the trappings of drugs alone when he states:'there is so much in life for you to feel/unfound in white,red or yellow pills/a mind excursion can be such a thrill/you please satisfy-take a chance and ride/the bird of beauty of the sky...stevie thanked jazz musician sergio mendes for the translation of lyrics on 'bird of beauty'to portuguese for him 2 be able 2 speak 2 his beautiful people of mozambique and the beautiful people of brazil.<br /><br />'smile please'is the final upbeat cut from this classic album.it's message is not for his woman 2 leave him in the midst of a breakup:'and i'll do everything you want me to/if you promise that you won't leave tonight/cause i'll cry a river of tears/with just the thought of you not here in my life'...the track has a strong climatic finish and ending with wonder begging 4 his woman 2 stay with him in the midnight hours and 2 never leave him,ending the album with an exhaustive breathtaking conclusion...as an 11 year old kid my father and i attended his concert together when he came 2 dallas and i still have his 1974 concert brochure entitled 'stevie wonder's fall festival tour'...stevie wonder would win grammies for his 'fulfillingness first finale'album in march,1975...of ecstacy-when you sleep at night babaa i wonder do i creep into your dreams-or could it be i sleep alone in my

'bird of beauty'is a similar twin 2 'smile please'but is more musically vibrant.the song has an unusualbeginning and is also sung in 2 different languages.it's message is for one to relax their mind when one is in stress.shirley brewer,lani groves and deneice williams provide exciting vocals 2 start the song off and they shine throughout the song.with free your mind lyrics,we all need time off and wonder delivers these time 2 relax sentiments:'simon says that now your mind desires a vacation/free it to join in fun and plenty recreation/there awaits you a ticket at ''please have a good time station''...these lyrics are for one 2 escape and to get away and let the mind and soul be free while at the same time wonder warns his listeners 2 enjoy life but leave the trappings of drugs alone when he states:'there is so much in life for you to feel/unfound in white,red or yellow pills/a mind excursion can be such a thrill/you please satisfy-take a chance and ride/the bird of beauty of the sky...stevie thanked jazz musician sergio mendes for the translation of lyrics on 'bird of beauty'to portuguese for him 2 be able 2 speak 2 his beautiful people of mozambique and the beautiful people of brazil.    'smile please'is the final upbeat cut from this classic album.it's message is not for his woman 2 leave him in the midst of a breakup:'and i'll do everything you want me to/if you promise that you won't leave tonight/cause i'll cry a river of tears/with just the thought of you not here in my life'...the track has a strong climatic finish and ending with wonder begging 4 his woman 2 stay with him in the midnight hours and 2 never leave him,ending the album with an exhaustive breathtaking conclusion...as an 11 year old kid my father and i attended his concert together when he came 2 dallas and i still have his 1974 concert brochure entitled 'stevie wonder's fall festival tour'...stevie wonder would win grammies for his 'fulfillingness first finale'album in march,1975...
1573223026|5.0|I read this book right after a heavy therapy session and I laughed my guts up.  Nick Hornby is so funny I could die of pleasure.  His characters are despairing losers just like the rest of us, horrible people really, but Nick loves them and laughs at them.  You've got to read it.
B00005JNTV|5.0|If you haven't read the comics, or have read them and don't like them, this is not a movie for you. You'll absolutely hate it.<br /><br />Being a fan of Frank Miller's for over 15 years (i'm 24) and a huge fan of Sin City for about 8 years I was totally pleased with this movie.  I have never seen a movie based off a comic done better. (Ghost World comes close, though).
B0006L16N8|5.0|I had to listen to \\"X&Y\\" several times before I decided it was a masterpiece. With \\"Parachutes\\" and \\"Rush..\\" I was immediately hooked and found myself very emotionally attached to most of the songs on both albums. Im not sure what initially threw me off with this one, except that when I first put the cd in I thought someone had kidnapped Coldplay and replaced them with U2 (if you just listen to the music the comparison is undeniable). <br /> <br /> I was so anxious for \\"X&Y\\" that I pretty much stalked the record store, and the stock boy, until the very second it was put on the shelves. I listened to it twice and was sort of disappointed, but then on a road trip a few days later I put it in again and I had an epiphany...THIS ALBUM IS AMAZING!! and breathtaking, heartbreaking, emotional and beautiful. I agree that the first single to be released, Speed of Sound (#7), is pretty much Clocks II but hey - thats a good thing because Clocks is fantastic, right? <br /> <br /> Square One is the perfect starting track for this cd because its very dynamic \\"BAM, here were are again after three years and we still rock out!!\\"  Then immediately following is the haunting ballad,What If, that makes me tear up the same way Trouble and The Scientist did way back when. Its hard to get to the rest of the cd because I want to repeat the first two songs over and over again. Song #4, Fix You, is also amazing. The feeling I get from this track is hard to explain but it reminds me of the way I felt watching the movie Magnolia when all the characters are singing Amiee Mann's Wise Up. Its very touching and realistic without being sappy. You want to think while you are listening to it that everyone in the world is listening too and screaming out the lyrics - especially toward the end when the guitars kick in for a little jam session while he is singing \\"Tears stream down your face...\\" <br /> <br />In true Coldplay fashion, the first half of \\"X&Y\\" is definately the best and most powerful; the rest of the cd still being very solid. Unlike some of the other customer reviewers, I feel like this album is something new, different and fresh in comparison with most of what's out there in all things rock and roll. I dont think this band has sold out one bit, nor do I think married life or parenthood has dulled Martin's musical senses. This album is different from the first two for sure. But it has a certain comfortableness that makes you feel like the world is going to be okay. Its nice to see a band like Coldplay evolve as musicians and not fall prey to the corporation that music has become, cranking out the same crap over and over again. It may take a few listens but be patient. I promise \\"X&Y\\" is worth it.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0009K7ROI|5.0|I would have bought this anyway, I have everything John Mayall released. I became a fan of Buddy Whittington after seeing and hearing the 70th birthday DVD and CD. I am not at all dissapointed with this. I have been playing guitar for 40 years and Buddy is just what I always wanted to do with the guitar. Nothing too flashy, just brilliant craftsmanship; I'm not sure weather to be encouraged or disscouraged by him. The rest of the CD is great too, I guess a harp or keyboard player would feel the same.(I am over 13).
B00006LI4S|5.0|David Gilmour performs a cross-section of Pink Floyd tunes, everything from \\"Fat Old Sun\\" to \\"A Great Day For Freedom,\\" playing mostly acoustic guitars and backed by a chamber ensemble consisting of cello, upright bass, piano, oboe, a second acoustic guitar and a 12-piece choir.  He even manages to throw in a couple of old Syd Barrett numbers!<br /><br />Gilmour is quite possibly the most expressive guitarist on the planet today, with his extravagant string bending and fluid fingerwork.  His blues feel has infused PF's work through the years, and is nowhere more evident than here.  The repertoire on these concerts plays up the anthemic nature of each piece, taken at a moderately relaxed pace and sung with palpable emotion.  Although the band is acoustic, these songs develop real power from their emotion and beauty. Far from \\"rock 'n roll,\\" the presentation here is almost 'modern classical music' -- with occasional wailin' Les Paul.<br /><br />Richard Wright comes on to sing a number, and two Bobs -- Wyatt and Geldof -- sing competing \\"Comfortably Numb\\"s.<br /><br />Production values are top notch.  The sound is astounding, there must be at least 12 cameras always in motion (although you almost never see one), the stage is well-lit (with white light, a rarity!) and the editing feels natural while eliminating almost all dead air between songs.<br /><br />In short this is a wonderful production from start to end.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Batman Begins is a slow starter. It goes into great depth about Bruce Wayne's history with flashbacks inside of flashbacks. This is done early on in the movie to such a pain staking degree that some people may think it was a mistake to expect this to be an action movie. People may chalk it up to a boring movie and stop watching before giving it a chance. <br /> <br />Batman Begins may start slow, but it builds momentum so gradually that by the end you're on a roller coaster ride going breakneck speed and your not even sure exactly at what point the true ride started. Instead of being numbed by the non-stop, start to finish barrage of action, you're left with the thrill of having been taken through a progressive ride. <br /> <br />Batman Begins also makes an unusual choice in using some of the more obscure villains. Most writers would typically go for the big names: Joker, Riddler, Catwoman et al. This movie goes for villains that you wouldn't probably recognize without being a fan. Sure anyone who has seen the animated series knows who Ra's Al Ghul and the Scarecrow are. But this has some appearances by some villains even more obscure than that: Zsasz and Joe Chill for starters. <br /> <br />While the character selection may seem to limit the audience to long time Batman fans only, what it really does is open the movie up to being taken to a place that most people have never seen Batman before. <br /> <br />There are several little nuances that make this Batman stand out from any previous incarnations. Newcomers can follow it. Fans can appreciate it. This is said with all possible respect due to the amazing movies done by Tim Burton. Batman Begins truly is the best of the Batman films out there. <br />
B0000009SM|5.0|Frank Zappa, one of the greatest guitar players/composers ever, has recorded numerous outstanding records (Joe's Garage, You Are What You Is, Overnite Sensation) and some that are not so good (The Man From Utopia, Thing-Fish). \\"One Size Fits All\\" is one of the outstanding ones and is a must have for anyone that appreciates music that isn't mainstream.     \\"Inca Roads\\" begins the journey with an infectious jazzy grove and awesome vibe work. The very tight band handles all segues and time changes effortlessly. The guitar solo here is incredible.     \\"Can't Afford No Shoes\\" is a straight-ahead bluesy rocker.    \\"Sofa No. 1\\" is a stellar mid-tempo instrumental. Love the brief tinkling vibe part!    \\"Po-Jama People\\" always puts a smile on my face. I'm not sure if it's the satirical lyric or the phrasing of the melody, but it's another great tune with an awesome guitar solo.    \\"Florentine Pogen\\" again shows off the incredible talents of the band.     \\"Evelyn, A Modified Dog\\" a one-minute keyboard vocal thingy is quite strange but completely normal for a Zappa record.      \\"San Ber'dino\\" is another rocking tune with wonderful backing vocals.    \\"Andy\\", my favorite on the album, is a progressive feast. It flows from straight ahead rock to jazzy interludes into very amusing vocal melodies. The drum and bass guitar syncopations are amazing.        \\"Sofa No. 2\\" is \\"Sofa No. 1\\" with vocals.           For the novice to Zappa this would be a decent start but there are many others that are just as good so explore and enjoy.
B00006LSM3|5.0|Some will say that All Things Must Pass is George's masterpeice, but it's because they don't know this album. This is not only my favorite Harrison, it's also one of my top ten album of all time. It's a wonderful album full of melodic and artful songs, subtle arrengments and soul from the start to the end, the highest point being Stuck Inside A Cloud. Any Road, another standout, has some of the most cool and inspired lyrics I know. Every other songs have their charms, you just have to buy the album to find it. Just put this cd in your discman, take a bus ride in a sunny day and look at the blue sky, look at the clouds, you'll probably see George smiling at you.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|One by One, to me at least, was a huge letdown. Specially after repeated listenings it was obvious that only the first 4 songs were worthwhile. Anyways, about \\"In Your Honor\\" this album is great. I can't see any of the songs here being elevated to the Foo Fighters' Classics Pantheon (like Everlong, My Hero, Learn to Fly, February Stars, etc.) but all songs, in both CDs range from solid to very good. <br /> <br />My only complaint is that there are none of the, what I call, \\"fun Foo songs\\", the likes Big Me, Generator, For All the Cows, you know. Once again Dave and Co. seem to be aiming to the grandiose and epic, even admitted so. So it's like One by One only done right. Some might say \\"they've matured as a band\\", I think they've lost one of the distinguishing features or their first releases. <br /> <br />The Highlights to me are: The Last Song, DOA, In your Honor, End Over End, Another Round, Razor, Miracle, Friend of a Friend.
B00007H1Y2|5.0|I bought this CD after seeing it listed on NPR as one of the best CDs of the year. I was not disappointed. The music is rich, varied and continually interesting. It's also a subtle CD, so don't expect the music to reach out and force you to listen.
B0009IW88A|5.0|I undoudbtedly enjoy this movie, and the music only added so much to it in my opinion. <br /> <br />Not having a realtive theme or certain structure, this score is mostly atmospheric and moody; just what the movie needed. It was dark, gritty, uplifting, and overall a very moving score. <br /> <br />It's not really possible to compare the score for 'Begins' to the other movies' scores; it is entirely different, but, since I'm really more for the emotional and atmospheric music, I preferred this one more.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|Wow, when did the Foo Fighters fan base become so pretentious? Some seriously weird reviews here.<br /><br />PUT DOWN THE PINOT GRIGIO AND EXPENSIVE FRENCH CHEESE AND BACK AWAY!<br /><br />This is beer drinking, belching, head banging music. It's not pretentious, deep meaning, moving lyrics music.<br /><br />If you like the Foo, you'll like this album. If you don't you won't.<br /><br />And stop with all the copy protection gibberish. You'll be able to copy this to your iPod just fine. The copy protection is a joke. If you can't figure it out do a google search, and stop being so hopeless!
B0007YBMA6|5.0|As a life-long horror/monster/sci-fi enthusiast, I would highly recommend this Japaneese two-disc set to any fellow genre fan reading this.  The images are really clear, not murky like the vhs and television version we've been accustomed to for years.  All the gorey (funny?) bits that were taken out years ago for 'moral' reasons are included.  With the addition of the also out-of-print 'Son of Kong' on the second disc, this unique package is well worth the investment, and a lot cheaper than an airline ticket to Tokyo in hopes of tracking it down!

B00005JNJT|4.0|Today, on opening day, I watched \\"Batman Begins.\\"  And while I am no expert on the associated comic books and graphic novels, I have seen Tim Burton's \\"Batman\\" movie from 1989 more times than I can count.  It's the only one that really mattered, until now, so the contrasts I draw will reference this movie more than Joel Schumacher's two lackluster attempts (\\"Batman Forever\\" and \\"Batman and Robin\\") and Tim Burton's own \\"Batman Returns.\\"<br /><br />Director Christopher Nolan is an appropriate choice for directing this franchise in that his work has, so far, been enigmatic and dark.  \\"Memento\\" and \\"Insomnia\\" both played out as creepy yarns which demanded some attention from the viewer, and if \\"Batman Begins\\" feels a little too straightforward compared to those two films, remember the kind of subject matter we are dealing with.  Batman is a cultural icon like Darth Vader or Frodo Baggins, and as such, any tricky storytelling for its own sake is out of the question.<br /><br />\\"Batman Begins\\" begins with Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) raising hell in a prison somewhere in Asia.  Liam Neeson, the mentor du jour for action stories, plays a martial arts expert named Ducard.  He recruits Wayne and encourages him to seek vengeance for his parents' slayings back in Gotham City, as part of a bigger housecleaning project he has in mind.  Nolan also goes to some trouble to set up Bruce Wayne's motivations: he thinks that his own fear caused his parents' deaths, hence his guilt, anger, and shame.  All of this is fine except that it takes a bit too long.  Where Tim Burton's \\"Batman\\" of 1989 skimped on the backstory, and just laid pieces of Wayne's past for the viewer to assemble, here the backstory ends up being a good chunk of the film.  It's action-packed enough, but a bit cumbersome.<br /><br />When the story gets back to the States, Nolan avoids the eternal nightscape of a highly stylized, comic book style Gotham City (\\"Batman\\" '89), populated by blocky American cars and one-dimensional yet entertaining characters, and instead creates a Gotham City that feels more like something we might actually encounter in the USA circa 2005.  It's the classic Gotham City crossed with the futuristic Los Angeles of \\"Blade Runner.\\"  It's a city with slums, skyscrapers, and elevated trains, like Chicago or New York.<br /><br />Bruce Wayne's metamorphosis from confused rich kid to tormented superhero is also depicted in some detail.  Where in previous movies Batman's existence is just taken for granted, here his transition comes into focus.  The effect is much like the explication in Sam Raimi's recent \\"Spider-man,\\" and although it answers many practical questions about our protagonist, it also leads to many other questions.  For example, Wayne Enterprises has for some reason created a $300,000 piece of body armor which Bruce uses for his alter-ego, but now we have to wonder: why did the company design it in the first place? The Batmobile, while very cool, falls under the same category.  It seems to exist, complete but for black paint, only because Batman needs a Batmobile.<br /><br />The supporting cast is rather hit and miss.  Of the ones that Nolan got right, Morgan Freeman does well what he knows how to do, and Rutger Hauer is laudable as a condescending corporate man with ambitions.  Cillian Murphy is appropriately icy in his role as Dr. Jonathan Crane.  Michael Caine is flawless as Wayne's father figure and right-hand man Alfred.  Here he actually represents an important character, a moral compass in a murky world, whereas in previous iterations, Alfred was little more than a cliche.  The biggest surprise, however, is perennial villain Gary Oldman as Sgt. Gordon, the one honest cop in a city of crooked ones.  Who knew?<br /><br />The misfires include Katie Holmes as D.A. Rachel Dawes; how exactly does a perky twenty-something pole-vault her way to the top of Gotham City's law enforcement community?  Tom Wilkinson is also miscast, as crime boss CarmineFalcone.  Wilkinson is an excellent actor (\\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" and \\"In the Bedroom\\" both come readily to mind), but here he lays it on pretty thick.  I can't help but think Danny Aiello or James Caan would have been a more appropriate choice.<br /><br />The action is good though, and there is plenty of it.  It's got those dazzling moments you'll remember long after you leave the theater.  Naturally the end of the movie sets up sequels, but not in an obvious way -- more in a way that makes you go \\"hmmmm.\\"<br /><br />Overall, \\"Batman Begins\\" is a pleasure to watch, and Christian Bale inhabits his character ably and credibly.  This rendition of the Batman story weighs in at 140 minutes, and although it does not feel extremely sluggish, it could have used just a bit of streamlining in the editor's room.

B00005JNJT|5.0|I just saw this movie last night, and it blew my socks off.  This is the beginning of a beautiful franchise.  It was even better than Tim Burton's takes on Batman, which I loved.  Christian Bale is the first truly scary Batman.  All of the actors are excellent, the story was exciting, the villians didn't overtake the movie...probably the best summer movie this year.
B0006399FS|3.0|....... is a thought that certainly crosses my mind when I listen to this album. The statements a little harsh (I've put it there to draw your attention to my hopefully balanced review of this album) but I feel as though 'How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb', U2's eleventh studio album, released in 2004 is way too overhyped and is in fact a pretty average work to say the least. U2 themselves, as you'll know have been around quite sometime and have indeed put their own unique and pretty influential slant on rock music over the years. However, this album is pretty much a burn out in many respects. Read on to see why I think this is.<br /><br />After listening to this album, the thing I would call anyone to do is to then listen to one of either 'The Joshua Tree', 'Achtung Baby' or 'War', three of U2's classic works. The thing that will cross your mind when you compare this album to these works is a SHEER DROP in quality and innovation. This recent album of U2's may have some good songs but it lacks any kind of killer touch and new style. To put it more clearly, U2 have played it safe yet again with this album and for me that is not what great rock bands are about. U2 were a great band, their stuff in the 80's was a great new idea in music and from then even the band themselves experimented with ideas such as a techno sound in the early 90's. However this album is completely unoriginal and sounds very much like its 2000 predecessor 'All That You Can't Leave Behind'. Coupled with this idea of the band playing it safe, I also believe that U2 have lost a load of respect as a band which they once had. Gone are the days when they kept out of advertising, interviews and award ceremonies. Now all they seem to do is the complete opposite - appearing on commercials such as advertising for ipods to name but one example. Its the old idea of a band getting mixed up in corporate ventures and letting their music production suffer because of it. Eventhough the band are still great musicians (The Edge is still one hell of a great guitarist) the whole U2 persona just annoys me now. Bono p***es me off the most with his regular arrogant rants saying 'U2 are the best band in the world' or 'Our new album is gonna be our best yet' and quite frankly people are tired of this man's big headedness (Eventhough I suppose at least he supports lots of charities and promotes them which is a good thing). Overall, 'How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb' is a mark of a sad decline for U2, one of the leading bands of previous years. The album title is crap, the cover is unineventive (How many covers have this band done showing just a picture of the band members!) and the music is distinctly average overall with no standout style to it at all. U2 have quite simply become sellouts with this album, sadly.<br /><br />So, the tracks themselves. Eventhough I've given the album a good pasting in the previous paragraph, there is some good stuff on here, hence the 3* rating. 'Vertigo' kicks off the album and this track, a single release that it became, is an excellent opener, with a catchy chorus and some heavy, driving guitar riffs. 'Miracle Drug' is a good follow up, with a dreamy style whilst still capturing that distinctive U2 sound. 'Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own' is perhaps the best track on the album, with some emotional singing from Bono making this a standout track. 'Love Peace or Else' is Ok; a little dull to start though it picks itself up as the song progresses. Next up is 'City of Blinding Lights' is a good, grand sounding song with another good chorus. 'All Because of You' is also pretty good although it sounds very reminiscent to previous U2 work.<br /><br />So, you think 'quite solid so far', however, things aren't too good hereon on the album. 'A Man and a Woman', starts nicely but becomes a bit of a boring ballad with some rather unoriginal lyrics (lets face it, the song title ain't original!). 'Crumbs On Your Table' is unmemorable - some good guitar playis all that stares out at you in this track. Bono sings 'One Step Closer To Knowing' and thats how I feel about the track - it feels as though its gonna develop into something excellent but never gets there. 'Original of the Species' is forgettable and 'Yahweh', a religion inspired song sounds just too overproduced. 'Fast Cars' though isn't a bad finish. The song has a nice pacy rhythm and with some catchy guitar work from The Edge - so not a bad finish to a distinctly average album.<br /><br />U2 have made an excellent contribution to music over the years but in recent years they have lost all sense of musical vision and foresight and now are quite sadly a group of middle-aged musicians playing it safe with their music. Maybe now its time to call it a day for the once great band because if they keep producing further albums like this one, it will be this substandard work that they may get ultimately remebered for in years to come.tar play is all that stares out at you in this track.

B0009A1AS2|4.0|Dream Theater is sometimes a frustrating band.  Each player is a near-virtuoso, and the group is ambitious and daring with each project.  That said, I found their last two efforts, \\"Six Degrees\\" and \\"Train of Thought,\\" were lacking both in memorable melodies and texture.  \\"Octavarium,\\" on the other hand, has it all. There are faster and slower songs, great melodies, AND the prog-like flash that DT fans expect.  I'm particularly impressed with John Petrucci's playing on this record.  I'll admit that his work sometimes doesn't involve me emotionally, but this album is an exception to that rule.  His playing shows variety, taste, and both restraint and reckless abandon - where each is necessary.  The icing on the cake is that the ending epic title track, all 24 minutes, is a superb musical journey that really sustains interest over the entire length of the track.  It's probably my favorite extended-length DT song and is a remarkable achievement.  <br />
B000002KIQ|5.0|I have owned this since 1978, first vinyl, then CD.  It is one album I will never be without.  I defy anyone to listen to \\"We Will Be Happy\\" without believing it, or to keep from dancing to \\"Happy Meeting in Glory\\", and I've already requested \\"Face to Face That I Shall Meet Him,\\" be played at my funeral, when that regrettable event becomes necessary (in the far distant future). This is joyous music, and highly evocative of a simpler though imperfect era.  This is one of Ry Cooder's best!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I actually bought the Donnie Darko DVD for five dollars. It caught my eye because of the cast. The cast includes Jake Gyllenhaal, Noah Wyle, Jena Malone, Patrick Swayze, and Drew Barrymore who also produced the film.  <br /> <br />This film is a psychological thriller. It is about a high school student (Gyllenhaal) who is very delusional. He has a strong opinion about society and isn't afraid to share it. Through out the movie he sees a psychiatrist who tries to help him with his oddness and attitude towards life.  <br /> <br />Later Gyllenhaal is visited by a demonic rabbit, is it a real, is it a dream or is it just a message from the future? This demonic rabbit appears every now and then and influences Gyllenhaal's actions. His conference with the rabbit makes him become interested in time travel.  <br /> <br />Towards the end of the movie the truth of certain individuals come about and the solution to the demonic rabbit is revealed.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed this movie because it challenges the viewers mind. It bottles you up until the end in which you are ready to have an understanding of the movie. <br />

B0009P42S2|4.0|Background:    Steamboy is the first movie directed by a giant from Japanese anime Katsuhiro Otomo since his ground breaking movie Akira from 16 years ago. Unlike most anime fans I saw Steamboy before seeing its more famous partner. If you are expecting another Akira you will be disappointed since Steamboy is a 180 degree opposite in ambiance although both movies explore similar themes. Instead of Akira's dsytopic nihilistic Neo-Toyko Otomo re-creates a romantic optimistic Victorian England. Steamboy has the feel of a more mainstream Hollywood style action/adventure movie. Steamboy presents a fascinating intersection of history and sci-fi as its backdrop. The DVD is the director's cut with your choice of having the dialogue in English, Japanese and various Romance languages. Also, one can have subtitles in English, and the other languages.     Non-spoiler Plot:    Steamboy takes place in Victorian England in 1866. Although Otomo rewrites history by throwing in many elements not yet existing in 1866 but are from that overall period including Tower Bridge and battleships not built till the last decade of the 19th century. The movie is centered on the ownership of a Steam Ball which can generate the power equivalent to a small nuclear reactor. The movie, as typical in many Japanese anime and fantasy movies, centers on the issue of what is the proper use of this new breakthrough technology. This conflict is represented as an intergenerational conflict within the Steam family. The elder Steam, Lloyd (voiced by Patrick Stewart) has become deranged seeing his invention being put to what he sees as evil uses, his son Eddie (voiced by Alfred Molina), who is half man/machine, in a Nietzschian view sees the Steam Ball as a showcase of the power of science for science sake to push humankind to new heights. Eddie's 13 year old son Ray (voiced by Anna Paquin) is caught in the middle trying to save his father and grandfather and London from the consequences of their invention. A nefarious corporation, the O'Hara Foundation wants the Steam Ball, and the British are interested in acquiring it too sending Robert Stephenson, a tribute to the namesake who with his father invented the railway locomotive and built the first rail line from Liverpool to Manchester in 1830, to gain control of the Steam Ball for the sake of national security.    The movie spends the first part in Manchester and the surrounding countryside, including a panorama showing to borrow Dickens \\"satanic mills\\" dominating the city spewing black smoke into the air. The movie shifts to London centered on a park on the bank of the Thames. Otomo accurately animates the atmospheric effects of London's fog and smog. The park is home to the Crystal Palace, magnificently recreated in this anime movie, housing the Great Exhibition and the O'Hara Foundation Pavilion, using the design of Royal Albert Hall. [In history, the Crystal Palace, one of the great architectural achievements of the Victorian era, was built in 1851 to house the Great Exhibition of that year. The Great Exhibition in what might be considered the first World's Fair organized by Queen Victoria's consort Prince Albert the Exhibition invited all the nations of the world to showcase the technologies and applications that came about from the Industrial Revolution.]  The O'Hara Foundation sponsors the research of Eddie and Lloyd Steam that resulted in the invention of the Steam Ball. As we learn in the film the O'Hara Foundation has darker purposes for attending the Great Exposition besides showcasing the latest benevolent inventions. The titular representative of the O'Hara foundation is Scarlett O'Hara (voiced by anime regular Kari Wahlgren), around the same age as Ray, who is the sole heir to the O'Hara fortune. We immediately get the idea the Scarlett is a spoiled brat who complains about the smell and soot of London and enjoys bossing around the head of marketing for the O'Hara Corporation Archibald Simon. (PETA membersmight not like what she does to her poor Chihuahua Columbus). Although Scarlett is the one character who undergoes the most change as she sees the consequences of the her family's firm inventions. The movie is filled with action and adventure including chase scenes, and battle that breaks out at the area around the Crystal Palace where Otomo introduces many of the \\"futuristic\\" elements of the movie, and the reveling of Eddie's vision of science in the Steam Castle (Steam Tower in the english subtitles).     Analysis:    The main strength of this film is the gorgeous combination of traditional hand drawn 2-D and 3-D CGI animation. From what I have read, Otomo and his creative design team spent time on England, visiting London, Manchester and York, and studying steam locomotives and machinery from the Victorian era to beautifully recapture Victorian England, the motifs of that era, and the mechanical designs of the machinery down to the last rivet. For example, the Royal Navy ships in the movie are accurate recreations of real warships from the Victorian era. This research paid off in the stunning detail of the movie. You are starring at the screen just to soak up the details of the machinery Otomo created. I enjoyed how the movie used real historic events and places, mentioned above, as the backdrop for the movie. They showed great imagination in designing the \\"futuristic\\" elements which retains a 19th century appearance and mechanical design. Unlike other Japanese anime with their convoluted plot lines this is a straight forward action/adventure movie. The movie is dominated by browns and has a sepia tone to it. There are some wonderful animation effects including how lenses distort images, from what I understand this is a very difficult effect, to scenes with tons of falling confetti, to a scene where glass is shattered and on each chard you see an imprinted moving image from an earlier scene.       There is not much character development in this movie except for perhaps Scarlett. Most of the characters are representations of the different uses of science and technology. Eddie is the personification of science for science sake without any moral/ethical considerations. Lloyd takes the opposite view that science must be looked at in terms of the moral/ethical impact and science should be restricted if it leads to a \\"bad\\" outcome. Ray is caught in the middle conflicted about what he should do and shows concern for both his father and grandfather. His actions and decisions are based on what he learns about the motives of the characters and his underlying desire to save his father and grandfather. Robert Stephenson sees science as being used for national security reasons. Scarlett espouses the economic rationale for scientific advancement. Although the characters are not quite so black and white. Eddie is perhaps misguided but he is not evil personified. When one sees Lloyd's vision of the uses of science for frivolity you might find yourself believing his view is just as extreme as Eddie's but in the opposite direction. Scarlett has the obvious rich girl spoiled brat attitude but Otomo shows underlying this faade is a sensitive, and intelligent girl. Otomo has these characters espouse their beliefs explicitly in their dialogue which often become monologues and lectures.      Otomo uses the several characters to present different philosophies on the use of science but leaves it up to the viewer to make their own decision. The plot could used some improvement and the action can get a bit overwhelming at times. The machinery tends to overwhelm the story Otomo is trying to tell.    I very much enjoyed the classical soundtrack by Steven Jablonsky. He developed wonderful themes for Ray and Scarlett and utilizes them throughout the movie.    Overall, Steamboy should appeal to a both anime fans and a more conventional audience. This movie is far superior to Hollywood's recent attempt at Steampunk with Will Smith's Wild Wild West and Sean Connery's The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.Time magazines Richard Corliss listed Steamboy, along with Akira, as one of the top 5 anime movies available on DVD. A side benefit of this movie is the educational opportunities this movie provides in further explorations of the Victorian era and the Industrial Revolution.     The movie is rated PG-13 for the action. The PG-13 is more to the PG side than R side. There is one scene with blood but there is no objectionable language or suggestive sexual scenes.     DVD Features: The transfer to DVD is excellent with great sound and picture quality. The aspect ratio was 1.85:1 so the transfer does not take full advantage of widescreen TVs, the wide screen version of Star Wars has an aspect ratio of 2.35:1. The DVD features are pretty bland. There is no director's commentary which is understandable give the language barrier. There is a 5 minute interview with director Katsuhiro Otomo. There is a 15 minute featurette about the challenges of re-dubbing the movie in English with Anna Paquin, Alfred Molina, and Patrick Stewart. The 20 minute multi-screen landscape study splits the screen three ways. First there are scenes from the movie mixed with real life shots of London. 15 minutes of this featurette are interviews with the creative team discussing how they made the movie. The ending montage shows the images from the end credits of the English dubbed theatrical release without the text. Although this ending was a condensed version of the director's cut ending, which is the ending for the movie on this DVD. The production drawings are still shots of paintings used to develop ideas in the movie, some of which are pretty interesting. The animation onion skins shows the process by which five scenes are built combining hand drawn and CGI techniques although there is no dialogue explaining the process.
B0009AM5JA|4.0|The first time I heard the album (after running out to get it as soon as it hit the shelves) I was really disappointed.  They all sounded the same.  Too much Chris Martin, not enough high intensity music.  The lyrics seemed weak too.<br />BUT, I kept listening and my opinion has changed quite a bit.  Some of the songs are very well written and interesting.  Martin sounds good on it, and there is a lot of high paced urgency in it like in previous releases.<br />&quot;The Hardest Part&quot; is a beautiful song and has really grown on me.<br />&quot;Swallowed in the Sea&quot; is great, and a different sound.<br />&quot;White Shadows&quot; has great lyrics and music - I think its my favourite on the cd.<br />&quot;What If&quot; is destined to be a classic - maybe Coldplay's best ever.<br />Square One, X&amp;Y and the rest are good - they are all good, and there is enough difference in each one to each to make them each specifically interesting.<br />I highly recommend this CD.  I loved the first 2 from Coldplay, and if you did too, you will love this CD.<br />Fo r their next CD, I'd like to hear them mix it up more - try some things really new.  This CD is a little too much for radio.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|I was a huge fan of the first X Men film and was excited once i heard they were doing a second film.  <br /> <br />The first film brought all the original characters together. It formed the coming of Wolverine and other Mutants. Because of the good beginning the second left a lot of room for a great story.  <br /> <br />What happens when the president who is supporting the equality of mutants-is attacked by a mutant? His views on the mutants become affected. The X Men must find Stryker the man who forced Nightcrawler to attack the president and the man responsible for the attack on the School for the Gifted.  <br /> <br />Through out their findings Magneto breaks out of prison, who then teams with the X Men to try and defeat Stryker who is trying to wipe out all of the mutants.  <br /> <br />I thought this film was great. They introduced so many more mutants. It's amazing what they can do with special affects. This film is filled with a lot of action and a great story, it won't bore you for a second. In my opinion I think it is better than Spiderman 2. If you enjoyed the first film, you will enjoy the second because it is about three times as enjoyable. <br />
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|When I walk the aisles of my local music store I can not begin to explain the dissappointment I feel when I see artists just churning out the same old crap over and over again. Not to mention we the public buying this stuff by the toilet full. If one thing can be said about System of a Down it is that they are different. They are not a \\"Boo-hoo my parents didn't love me\\" band, nor are they a \\"I can't get a girlfriend because I am a unique and delicate snowflake band.\\" Their music is lyrically brilliant, both pointed and chaotic all at once. Below will be my humble opinion in track by track fashion... <br /> <br />1) \\"Soldier Side (intro)\\": I never can bring myself to understand why bands add intros to their albums. They are short, often times contrived little pieces of music seemingly their only to prolong a short album. This is pretty much the case here, although this slightly over 36 minutealbum is only half of the full product, the rest of which (\\"Hypnotize\\") is due out later this year. That being said this intro is well done and eases you into the first half of this album. 6/10 <br /> <br />2) \\"B.Y.O.B.\\": The band's first release off of this album is one to remember. It is both hard and melodic at times and has a poignaint political message. Chances are if you haven't heard it then you don't listen to much radio, which unfortunately these days is not a bad thing.  9/10 <br /> <br />3) \\"Revenga\\": I think now it is time to mention what you most likely have heard already. Daron Malakian, SOAD's guitarist, does a lot more singing on this album. System fans should be familiar with the harmonizing he used to do with System's vocalist Serj Tankian. Now he takes over much of the singing which you can either take as a refreshing change or a bit annoying. I am in the league of the latter, although his voice does somehow fit most of the songs I am such a great fan of Serj Tankian that it is hard to hear someone else taking over the singing/screaming duties. Revenga isa little gem punctuated with a great guitar riff near the end of the song that heightens the emotion of the piece. 9/10 <br /> <br />4) \\"Cigaro\\": Cigaro is a short and very System-like piece. Anyone familiar with System's biting sarcasm should eat this one up. Their political overtones can again be found in a perfectly humorous fashion. In no uncertain terms System points out the flaws in the mentality of political leaders. 8/10 <br /> <br />5) \\"Radio/Video\\": A beautiful piece partly about two of Malakian's childhood friends. Malkian's voice can be heard hear very often and this is one of his best preformances. The naturally increasing tempo and circus-like music near the end is very beautiful and very well done. 9/10 <br /> <br />6) \\"This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I Am On This Song\\": System just missed out on having a full line of text on this interesting song title. I liken this song to other of System's early oddities like \\"CUBErt\\". The lyrics are off the wall and System's Armenian roots can be heard as Serj bellows, \\"Killers never hurt feelings\\" with a great Middle-Eastern flair. Killer indeed... 8/10 <br /> <br />7) \\"Violent Pornography\\": The first song that I didn't really care for at first. It opens with Daron and Serj tongue twisting the word \\"everbody\\" several times quickly and going on to explain that TV and media isn't good for you. This one will take some getting used to as it is also one of the more pop ridden songs on the album and perhaps the only song on the album that could be considered filler (along with the intro). 6/10 <br /> <br />8) \\"Question!\\": Easily the best song on the album for me personally. Between Serj's early eerie whispering right to the hard edged Na-Na-Naing late in the song, this one grabs you and doesn't let go. This is the only song written entirely by Serj on this album and I think it shows. One of System's best, this song has Malakian playing second fiddle and harmonizing with Serj much like he used to do on songs like Toxicity's hit, \\"Chop Suey\\". It should also be noted that John Dolmayan's drumming and the guitar on this winner are also superb. 10/10 <br /> <br />9) \\"Sad Statue\\": This one is screaming air-time. If System has plans for a second single one can only hope it is this one at least for the sake of their commercial success. This one may be my favorite lyrically, in short saying that we are all going done the aforementioned toilet, socially speaking. Serj questions, \\"What is in us that turns a deaf ear to the cries of human suffering?\\" in this emotional roller coaster. 10/10 <br /> <br />10) \\"Old School Hollywood\\": This is another System of a Down classic oddity. System of a down fans can appreciate Tony Danza references in this neat little song about Daron playing in a celebrity baseball game at Dodger Stadium and how he felt out of place amungst the celebrities. Great drumming and guitar work again drive this song. 8/10 <br /> <br />11) \\"Lost in Hollywood\\": This is the 2nd song that took some getting used to for me because uncharacteristically for System of a Down this is a slow ballad about how Hollywood can twist and break someone. This song is one that I feel will turn off System fans because it is both out of their usual style and not a song that everyone will be able to connect with personally. However, that is not to say that this song isn't exceptional and filled with emotion. I put it in the same ballpark as \\"Aerials\\" only not as heavy. A very pretty song... 9/10 <br /> <br />     In conclusion this is an album that is greater than the sum of its parts. I again have trouble pointing out one song that makes this song so great, much like System's other albums. It is just one of those that you have to listen to fully to enjoy. And being so short it is very accessible. This one leaves me chomping at the bit for the 2nd half, \\"Hypnotize\\" again, due out later this year. This half album is a true winner... 5/5 Stars...
B000000OAH|5.0|...but \\"Jazz\\" is bound to be one of your favorite Queen albums.I would like to quickly address the concerns of people who say that this cd lacks the song-writing prowess of other earlier albums such as \\"Queen II,\\" \\"Sheer Heart Attack,\\" or \\"Night at the Opera.\\" It is true - these songs are not as well-written! This album does not contain a genius moment like \\"March of the Black Queen\\" or \\"Bohemian Rhapsody.\\" Some would say that, because this album has no masterpiece and lacks some of the masterful songwriting of earlier albums, it is worse and not warranted to a full rating of five stars.    And therefore, why do I say nay? Why do I say, despite the arguments of other people, that this is a full five star album? I'll tell you. This album is terrific because it is all about feeling. When you listen to this album, the songs have power to conjure up emotions within you. That is the success of Queen. When I listen to their music, I'm not just thinking about the merely instrumental and vocal passages. These songs take me away! It is difficult to describe to wear; but when you are listening to particularly good music, you forget that instruments are being played and rather think of the emotions that the songs conjure up.     Given, not all songs on this album are that way. There are admitting some lackluster numbers. Except for one, these are not bad songs, but merely lacking in the enjoyability of the greater tracks. I can genuinely say that there is only one song on this album that is worth a skip. As to the concern of the flow of the album - it is true that this album is an extremely eclectic mix of different styles. It has rocking moments, woeful moments, and fun moments. Sometimes, it seems like the transition between a low-key song and high-key song is too sharp. But to be quite honest with you, these somewhat awkward transitions are easily forgotten. In a couple listens, this cd is of such a nature that when one songs ends, you expect the beginning of the next one. It does flow as an album - it merely takes time to get used to the order of the songs. Now, I would like to review each song:    1. Mustapha: Excellent opening cut. Other people say \\"Let Me Entertain You\\" should have opened the album, but in my opinion this one is even stronger. As we have seen from earlier albums, Queen loves to shock us from the very first note. Freddie sings \\"Ibrahim!\\" and has our attention with immediacy. The lyrics in this one are quite fun to sing along to - even if you have no idea what he is saying. Also, it is of note that this song flat-out rocks! Might I recommend you listen to it loud? At 1:20 it just explodes. Great song. 9.5/10    2. Fat Bottomed Girls: This is one that you have probably heard. The full version of this song includes extended guitar work which makes the song flow even better. \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\" starts with an excellent a cappella intro with some lovely vocal harmonies that Freddie always knew how to pull off. Then that rocking guitar riff comes in, followed by drums, followed by vocals, followed by some excellently placed bass slides courtesy of John Deacon. Finally we get to the chorus which is a great sing-along. Trust me, if you listen to this song in a room with a lot of people...a lot of people will be singing. A very good, rocking song. 9/10.    3. Jealousy: Follows the tradition of \\"Nevermore,\\" \\"Love of My Life,\\" and \\"You Take My Breath Away.\\" This song is not quite on par with those others (maybe it's the presence of the drums, which make the song a bit more conventional.) Regardless, Freddie's vocals are excellent - and the choir behind him at times is done very well. The bassline and piano line complement the feel of the song perfectly. Brian May also uses a sitar-like instrument sparsely but effectively in this one. Overall, Freddie does another great job of conveying a distinct emotion - jealousy - through a song. By the way, if you listen very closely to the end of the song you'll hear a little bit of bass sliding that is the transition to the next song. Not sure how many people pick it up. 9/10    4. Bicycle Race: This, quite simply, is Queen in its purest form. It is completely ridiculous, while maintaining excellent musicianship at all times. Just as in \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\" there is an excellent - even better - a cappella introduction, one that is quite shocking when listened to loud. Then bass and drums come in, and Freddie sings about an emotion we all have sometimes - wanting to ride our bicycles! I think what he's getting at in this song is that sometimes we should stop worrying so much about everything, and instead use simple activities - like bicycling - to help relax us and \\"forget all our duties.\\" The lyrics in this song are just so funny and great. One minute in, there is a huge change in the feeling and tempo of the song - excellently done! The bells solo and guitar solo are also done perfectly. Oh yea, and the bassline is very well done too. And all this in three minutes! 9.75/10    5. If You Can't Beat Them: Remember how I said earlier that there is only one song which warrants a pass? Well, this is it. Very trite sounding. The riff is not really clever at all. The lyrics are nothing either. Same about the guitar solo, and lyrics. Even the singing isn't particularly amazing - unusual for Mercury. True, there is one good moment of silence in the song (as in, the silence is used effectively), but overall this song is just bad - by Queen standards and elsewise. Do not despair though! \\"Night at the Opera\\" had \\"Sweet Lady,\\" yet remains a stellar album. Just as then, this album will improve - and John will make a comeback. 4 / 10    6. Let Me Entertain You: Mercury picks the album back up again. This song is all about how Mercury wants to entertain us. I'd say he usually succeeds. The guitar riff on this one is pretty good. The drum work is very well done on this track, and the lyrics are a hoot too - very clever. Most people call this one of their favorites on the album. I tend to disagree, but it is still a strong cut. 8/10    7. Dead On Time: May always provides us with a great rocker on the album. This song is no exception. The guitar riff comes in which quickly proves that Queen is capable making songs of something like Metal. It's just quite furious riff. The bass doubles it which only adds to the rocking feel. The ensuing lyrics are very angry, a mocking ode to the people who live in a world of anxiety and greed. He proclaims that these people who always want to be dead on time - are in fact dead! ON the inside, that is. Clever. The addition of the \\"thunderbolt courtesy of God\\" is also very smart and gives the song a perfect climax. There is then rain, which is used as an expertly transition to the next song. 9/10    8. In Only Seven Days: This is the shortest song on the album and one of the best. Deacon makes up for his mistake of \\"If You Can't Beat Them\\" with this heartfelt number. The piano which starts the number is very soothing. Then, Mercury's vocals come in which are just as sweet as ever. This song bears witness to the extreme versatility of Freddie's voice, which but one song ago was fuelled with anger. His ability to convey completely different emotions in each song help make this album as enjoyable as it is. The lyrics are also terrific, with lovely imagery about a short-lived romance on a vacation. The guitar solo is multi-layered and sounds as though it could have been lifted off of a song from the \\"Night at the Opera\\" era of Queen. Overall, this song - while short - contributes greatly to the feel of the album. 9.5/10    9. Dreamer's Ball: May's number here is in a way similar to the previous track, which deals with a love that cannot be. This song, however, is quite cheerful. The guitar chords and orchestration are the jazziest thing on the album, and have a very bluesy and lounge-y feeling. The lyrics are again well written, with excellent imagery. This song is yet another hidden hit on thealbum. It really makes you want to dance. You can usually tell you're dealing with a great song when it makes you want to dance. 9.5/10    10. Fun It: The Roger Taylor songs on this album often cause a great deal of controversy. People say that these songs are an indication of where Queen was going - simpler recording with less real substance. Maybe the Roger songs are indications of all that. Regardless, they should not be so harshly judged. Though the songs are not extremely well written, they are still enjoyable. \\"Fun It\\" is a pretty fun song which makes you want to tap your toes. It's got a good beat and some well done guitar work - quite sharp sounding. This song might not be stellar, but it is so different from the next one that the sudden change is actually quite enjoyable. 7/10    11.  Leaving Home Ain't Easy: This May song is in the same vein as \\"'39\\" and \\"Long Away\\" in that it is an acoustic based number which Brian sings himself. The opening riff is very soft and also very pleasant. There are then some nice strings - I suppose it must be more guitar orchestration, on account of the fact that Jazz features no synthesizers. The lyrics in this song are particularly memorable and convey perfectly the emotion of having to leave a loved place and loved ones. In the instrumental, Brian modulates his voice in such a way that it sounds like a woman begging him not to love. All in all, a very touching number with great lyrics. Great transition to the next number, as well. 9 / 10    12. Don't Stop Me Now: This song, much like Bicycle Race, is pure Queen. It opens with a very nice piano line and the excellent Freddie vocals that we can always depend on. About thirty-two seconds into this song, it gets much louder, while still based on piano, drums, and bass. To further show the versatility of the band, they manage to go without a guitar line of any sort all the way to the guitar solo! Most bands would be incapable of creating a rock song with no guitar for the majority of the song - but then, Queen wasn't most bands. The guitar solo itself is excellent done, one of Brian's most exuberant. It reminds me quite a bit of the \\"Somebody to Love\\" guitar solo, in that it captures the energy of the song up to the solo and translates it into guitar form. Hats off for that one, Brian. This song is such a fun number; you really can't help but sing along. The excitement of the track finally ends with Mercury saying he doesn't want to stop at all. Have you ever had a night where you really felt abso-freakin-lutely wonderful? That's exactly what this song is about! It's about that time when you really feel alive. This song really captures the emotion excellently. At the end of the song, Freddie sings the tune of the song to himself, as his voice fades out. Well that's what it feels like on an awesome day - you just want to keep singing into the distance! Excellent song. 9.75 / 10    13. More of that Jazz: It's interesting that this song was added. The album could have well been finished with \\"Don't Stop Me Now.\\" That's probably how I would have ended it. Regardless, this track was added, and it is enjoyable enough. Roger Taylor sings on it which is always a pretty nice change from Freddie's voice. This song is less funky than \\"Fun It\\" and seems more serious too. The guitar riff is pretty catchy too. I also enjoy the chorus. This song is another one fun to sing along to - even the collage of the album's other songs at the end. Overall, this may not be the best way to end the album, but enjoyable enough. 7/10    So, now I must tie up loose ends. Is this work as genius as some of Queen's early works? Certainly not. Does it contain an absolutely stunning song of genius? Certainly not. It does, however, have tracks which are extremely fun and enjoyable to listen to. This album always reminds me of summer; partially because I first listened to it during the summer; but also because it has an exuberant, fun, and joyous nature to it. This is indeed essential Queen - highly recommended!
B0000AM6IY|4.0|The full screen version doesn't present this cinematic spectacle as it should be seen...and there are no special features except a trailer.  Check which version you're getting before you order...I think some of these reviewers purchase different editions.  This is no-frills, all the way---which explains the bargain price...if you're a fan of this magnificent musical, you're better off spending the money on the Collector's Edition.<br /><br />However, if you just want to enjoy the great music and dance of WEST SIDE STORY, it's worth having.  Rita Moreno and the chorus of dancers (especially the Puerto Rican gang & their gals) never fail to enthrall!
B00005JNJT|5.0|This movie is great iam not gonna ruin anything but the movie is definitly worth your time its abit long but entertaning and the ending is the best setting up for  the original with you know who the joker go see this movie its is so good i hope Bale does more batman movies is the future and with the same team and without a doubt the best sequel
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Another great album by Avril!  I was a little scared that it wouldn't be as good as her last one, but this one is even better!  I have a comment to (Bush X) who really rubbed me the wrong way from his review.  You ask why people would want to listen to negative and painful lyrics?  Because it's real life!  People like me, who don't have a great life can really feel the pain and sorrow from her music!  It makes us feel better.  Negative and painful songs will last forever too!  Happy pop songs die out quickly!  All great music comes from the pain and sorrow that we all have.  Thanks Avril for your musical genius!
B000000OQY|5.0|I got Gn'R Lies for my birthday yesterday, and I don't regret it. Gn'R is my favourite band. This is one of their weakest albums though, but it still gets 5 stars! I would give it 4.5, or a 4.3, but it's Gn'R and it's new. Kicks off with Steven's drumming, shows us how he could drum in a punkier, harder way than Matt. Axl then pops in, and the action begins. <br /> <br />In Nice Boys, the rough attitude of the band keeps going. Then we have Move To The City, what a great riff! I think it's my new favourite riff. It's awesome. This version is superior than the live version. Much of a party song! The first side closes with Mama Kin, and even though I like Aerosmith, I've got to admit this version breaks Aerosmith's one in two, though Steve (sp?) Tyler did a better job saying the \\"waaagon\\" or \\"draaaaagon\\" parts. I like the guitars here better too. Mama Kin may be the best song here -- It's too cool!  <br /> <br />Then we get Gn'R's first ballad ever, Patience. Patience is great. Axl shines here, great lyrics and vocals. Well, vocals only, since Izzy wrote this thing alone. It's never been one of my favourites, but it's great. I Used To Love Her is funny, and some kind of rip-off/sampling the Rolling Stones' Dead Flowers, which has the same three chords and the exact same solo! You're Crazy is more bluesy here, I haven't listened to it much but I still like the Appetite version better. <br /> <br />Closes with One In A Million, in which Izzy saves the day with an amazing rhythm guitar and Slash does one of his best solos ever -- And I mean it! Overall, a great album. The action is nonstop, especially in Side 1, which is better IMO. I strongly recommend getting this album. Made me get back on Gn'R, I stopped listening to them a while before.
0743201140|3.0|This is almost a really good book.  For all the publicity and praise, there is a uniquely profound and empowering Message here: Lose your inferiority complex; our \\"Performance\\" hang-ups are too often about trying to function like everyone else, instead of capitalizing on our own individual idiosyncrasies. Harnessing our intrinsic talents is the most obvious way to contribute something unique to our work and to our lives. Unfortunately, this message gets buried underneath the same tired Nu-Business tripe which assumes that productivity in the workplace is the ultimate human endeavor.  It seems as though the authors' tunnel vision blinded them in the face of a grand revelation, and not seeing the potential brillance inherent in this book's premise, felt compelled to water it down with a heavy prescription of corporate \\"relevance\\".<br /><br />Witness the uncomfortable third section of the book, where the authors instruct us, after discovering our own strengths, in the art of manipulating the particular strengths of our co-workers.  Apparently if you got the impression that we're locating our talents and the talents of others in order to be happy and self-fulfilled, you missed the real point...THE BOTTOM LINE OF COURSE! The authors' attempts to pretend that some of these skills can be productively expressed in the Office, like Ideation and Intellection, are great for a laugh...\\"Give this individual time to sit and think...Listen to their 'ideas'...Dupe them into thinking their job makes any use whatsoever of their creativity...etc.\\"  Better advice would be for the employer to cut a severance check for their Ideationist and buy them a plane ticket for New York or Paris.<br /><br />To wrap things up, it's a quick read, got a good central premise, and should be most useful for the Reader's Digest/\\"Oh Boy Now I'll Get That Promotion!\\" set.  For everyone else i'd recommend that you take to heart the point being made by this book...and put the $17 bucks towards something actually useful for developing your strengths.  And keep an eye out for employers acting funny and talking about cultivating the uniqueness inherent in everyone.  It's still the same game for them...just new rules.eful for developing your strengths.  And keep an eye out for employers acting funny and talking about cultivating the uniqueness inherent in everyone.  It's still the same game for them...just new rules.
0316172324|3.0|Blink is about making an inital judgement and going with it.  The author uses many different historical examples to illustrate his theory.  I found a lot of the material to be very intuitive, but it was interesting to read a good sound philosphy and basis behind what most of us do as habit. <br /> <br />Basically this book looks at the reason why we make our decisions, and I enjoyed it.  I would have liked for him to have delved into the subject a little more and gotten into the deeper psychology of the matter. <br /> <br />Overall, a good read.
B00097A5I6|5.0|This will not be Oasis' masterpiece return, however, it's a solid effort.  Each song on the album is a great song with solid lyrics and a brilliant sound. The problem for most will be the lack of over the top anthems. While most other Oasis' albums were a mixture of great, okay and bad songs, Don't Believe the Truth is all good song, minus the anthems. I my mind, better than the new Coldplay. Best tracks..Mucky Fingers, Part of the Queue, A Bell will Ring and Let there be Love. Worst tracks...the isn't one. <br />I also recommend the new Nine Inch Nails album With Teeth. <br /> <br />
B000002BQK|5.0|Attention: Mariah Carey has changed. No more parent-accepted humble clothing; no more sweet-natured adult-contemporary sound. Instead, she starts to put on sexier outfits (or in other words, she wears considerably less clothes than usual), and she steers her music into hip-hop influenced sound. The result: SURPRISINGLY AWESOME!  <br /> <br />After listening to Mariah singing one ballad after another for more than half a decade, you'd think she would remain such a sweet girl forever and ever. Yet on this album, she shows the naughty and seductive side of herself. And it works out really well; you'd wish she has done this earlier. The songs are arguably among her best works. \\"Honey\\" is simply outstanding, possibly one of her best up-tempos. The music is hip and sensual, the lyrics seductive, and Mariah sounds sexier than ever. \\"When you love someone so deeply/ They become your life/ Its easy to succumb to overwhelming fears inside/ Blindly I imagined I could/ Keep you under glass...\\" are the first verses of the beautifully written title track, which she sings so flawlessly, holding back her voice until it explodes into climax on the bridge. \\"The Roof\\" also stands out with its sexy lyrics and Mariah's breathy-yet-soulful delivery, while \\"Fourth Of July\\" offers one of Mariah most romantic lyrics yet: \\"...Then you put your hand in mine/ And we floated away/ Delicately lay entwined/ In an intimate daze/ A crescent moon began to shine/ And I wanted to stay/ Tangled up with you among the fireflies/ On that Fourth of July...\\". On another track, \\"Breakdown\\", she offers perhaps the funkiest break-up songs ever; it is actually one of my favorite tracks. Her voice really shines on this yet another really well written track.  <br /> <br />Beside the already-famous ballads \\"Butterfly\\" and \\"My All\\", there are other hidden treasures on this album: \\"Close My Eyes\\" and \\"Otherside\\". Both tracks are also ballads, but with a different style from her usual ones; they are more mature and simply more soulful (the lyrics of \\"Close My Eyes\\" really touch my heart). But the best track on this endless list of classy tracks is definitely \\"The Beautiful Ones\\". Perhaps you would feel that this track is slightly too long (like what I felt at the first few listens), but once you get used to the length, you will realize how fabulous this track is. It is arguably her best duet to date. Both Mariah and Dru Hill give us all what they've got to offer. Simply outstanding! But then, this album is so outstanding itself, it is almost difficult to pick a favorite. Regardless of whether you like Mariah Carey or not, you will embrace this album. It IS that good. <br />
B0009HLDFU|4.0|First I'll begin by saying that I forced myself to like their last album much more than I did at first, and now I plainly state that \\"One by One\\" is without a doubt their weakest album. So, I don't want to go too overboard here just yet.  <br /> <br />First, let's start with the rock disc. It could very well be not even as good as \\"One by One.\\" Sure, \\"Free Me,\\" \\"DOA,\\" \\"End Over End,\\" and \\"In Your Honor\\" (I changed my mind about this song) kick ass, but... there's just something missing from it. Perhaps it's a lack of diversity. Perhaps they were trying too hard to rock out. But there might be more hope for it then \\"One by One\\" due to the fact that I don't like it a whole lot right away. Time will tell.  <br /> <br />So that leaves the acoustic disc, and so begins the gushing. When I first heard about them doing this, I was highly optimistic. Finally, in the eight years that I've liked the band, they would be doing something different for a change. \\"One by One\\" suffered because it was mostly more of the same. Surely they couldn't do that with acoustic stuff, right? You can't strain yourself to rock hard on acoustic, since acoustic music doesn't rock generally. And I'm happy to say this album absolutely meets up to my expectations, and even shatters them from time to time. It is masterful. It is familiar, but different. It is like Beck's \\"Sea Change\\" album, which was all acoustic and sappy, too, and I also love a lot. And the strings, mandolin, accordion, piano, keyboards, and harmonica found on various songs add such a fantastic and layered dimension to the affair. The Norah Jones song? Exactly as great as I was hoping it would be. I have loved Dave's vocals since I first heard \\"Everlong\\" in 1997, and I'm totally not ashamed to admit that. This disc highlights just how awesome and underrated his voice can be. On one song, his voice reaches a high note that I never thought it could reach. So what makes me think that I'm not forcing myself to like this more than I actually do? My tastes in music have matured greatly since 2002, and I know I know better now. This disc is the kind of stuff I actually listen to more now, while the rock disc is kind of stuck in the past.  <br /> <br />So, in short, I'll say that if you don't like the acoustic disc, you probably didn't like songs like \\"Walking After You\\" or \\"Ain't It the Life\\" in the first place. And if you can't appreciate the simplistic beauty of the acoustic disc, you should never have been listening to the Foo Fighters anyway. Go home.
B0006FO8RA|3.0|I actually bought two Britney greatest hits albums.  I've been wanting a change up of vocal style for awhile and felt that was achieved in Toxic.  Me Against the Music (Madonna), Stronger and Outrageous are also stand out performances.  On the flip side, the remake of My Perogative is simply awful.  It would have been better served with Bobby Brown making a guest appearance (of course, between court appearances).  Also, the new song Do Something was easy to forget.  The song that I want to hurl across the room and smash into a million pieces is I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet a Woman.  Was the purchase worth it?  Yes - because I liked at least 1/3 of the 17 tracks.
0440224764|5.0|This is a fascinating story, but if you look below the surface, you see much implausibility.<br /><br />The protagonist, Patrick Lanigan aka Danilo Silva, keeps losing things: his first wife, a partnership in his law firm (he's a lawyer, what else?), some of the skin on his chest and legs, 90 million dollars, and finally his Brazilian girlfriend, who is also an attorney.<br /><br />What would you call this man?  I call him a loser.<br /><br />Oh, I can identify with him, all right.  He wants to take the \\"geographic cure,\\" move far, far away from his problems, just like an alcoholic or addict.  According to A.A., the geographic cure doesn't work.  But Patrick does give it a good shot.<br /><br />What's implausible, and reprehensible, is that he would use an old man's body (the man was already dead), to fake his own death, thus to make a \\"clean\\" getaway.  He even attends his own funeral.<br /><br />Even though the old man was dead, Patrick showed how selfish he is (was?) by even using the corpse so he can further his own purposes.  I was glad when Eva, his Brazilian paramour (or so we believe) stood him up.  The man is a loser, but the only way he can turn it around is to learn to live on his own, depending only on himself, not on the millions that he lost, not on anyone else, just his own head.<br /><br />I don't think Grisham's Patrick Lanigan, aka Danilo, can actually do that.<br /><br />Aside from that, the other characters in this book are all very interesting, and the Coast, the Gulf Coast he means, is a very interesting area, made so by Grisham's sharp prose.<br /><br />Grisham also sets some of the book in Brazil and in parts of Europe, Washington, New York, Miami, and other cities.  All of this is intriguing, and believable.  This book held me in a grip and I finished it in three days.<br /><br />Patrick, however, is not believable.  No one could be that smart and that much of an emotional loser.  Or is truth stranger than fiction?<br />
B00000F14B|5.0|This is great!  We love it, and our whole family watches it often! <br /> <br />So happy to finally have our own copy!
B0009HLDFU|5.0|I bought this earlier today.  Listened to disc 1 in the car ride home from the store-  I was literally rocked silly by these tunes.  So much energy and power.  The mix is way better than One by One- sounds great in my car.  Each song that went by I was getting more excited about how the album rocks with great grooves, riffs, tightness, and also melody emotion and sweet harmonies.  Wow- a lot of new ideas here- and the drumming is totally bad ass-  The single, Best of You, is not the best song here- many others to listen and rock out to, <br /> <br />I have only listened to the first two tracks on Disc 2 but I already love it- I have been waiting for Dave to do this, knowing it would be welcome change for him-  <br /> <br />I am a musician and a recording engineer and I just in awe of Dave Grohl's talent-
B00005JNJT|5.0|Since his first dramatic appearance in Detective Comics in 1939, Batman has grown to become a pop-culture icon.  From movie serials in the 40's, to a classic campy TV show in the 60's, to a solid animated series in the 90's, fans have thrilled to the super heroics of this unique character. However, as a film franchise, he has brought results that were somewhat less than impressive creatively.  While the Tim Burton directed films, BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS were stylish and dark, they also suffered from plot holes you could drive a Batmobile through.  Then Joel Schumacher introduced a Day-Glo sensibility to the Dark Knight in BATMAN FOREVER, before drowning the character in ludicrous costumes (a Bat suit with nipples???), pun-filled foes, and whiney sidekicks in the lousy BATMAN & ROBIN.  By then, Batman as cinematic property had become a laughingstock.  Fortunately, indie film director Christopher Nolan reinvigorates the franchise in glorious form in BATMAN BEGINS, a reboot of the Batman legend that, for the first time, puts the focus squarely on our hero and not on the over-the-top villains of past films.  Nolan also bases the film in a strong semblance of reality that allows the audience to not only accept the possibility of the winged vigilante, but embrace it as well.      Most fans already know the story of how wealthy Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) loses his parents when they are slain during an attempted robbery, but the movie also tells how he chose the bat as his symbol, as well as the steps needed to become the avenger of the night that he turns into.  Disillusioned and frustrated by Gotham City's corrupt judicial system, the young Wayne goes abroad to study the criminal mind.  Later, while locked in an Asian prison, Wayne is recruited by the enigmatic Ducard (Liam Neeson), who offers him a path in which to focus his anger and hone his skills.   Wayne eventually joins his new mentor as a recruit in the mysterious League of Shadows, headed by the sinister Ra'sAl Ghul (Ken Wantanabe).   Eventually, Wayne realizes that he cannot follow the League's extreme methods of dispensing justice and returns to Gotham to forge his own way.  It soon turns out that Wayne's return is just in time as Gotham falls prey to a fear epidemic engineered by the twisted Dr. Jonathan Crane AKA \\"the Scarecrow\\" (Cillian Murphy) and a familiar figure from Wayne's past.    From the top on down, this film is blessed with a solid cast that adds wonderfully to Nolan's vision.  As the title hero, Christian Bale blows all other Batman portrayers out of the water with his intense and scary take of the role.  This is a Batman that you not only fear, but can relate to as well.  In fact, he turns in the definitive performance.  Michael Caine adds warmth and humor as Wayne's trusty butler, Alfred.  Liam Neeson does a great variation of his usual mentor roles as Ducard, a man with his own surprising secret.  As an assistant DA and Wayne's childhood friend, Katie Holmes does a nice job with what is basically a thankless role.  Cillian Murphy makes for a perfectly creepy Scarecrow, while Morgan Freeman is solid as usual as the man who provides Batman's wondrous car and gadgets.  Gary Oldman is wonderfully cast against type as Jim Gordon, one of Gotham's few honest cops.  The scene in which he drives the tank-like Batmobile is a sheer delight.      The screenplay by Nolan and David Goyer (who wrote the BLADE films) is awash with characterization and motivation...something that you don't see in many comic book films as a rule.  In fact, you get so engrossed by the proceedings that you almost forget that you are watching a \\"superhero\\" film in the first place.  The special effects are used to enhance the story and not overpower it, while the set design pictures a Gotham that is a unique cross of Chicago, New York and Hong Kong.  If there is a flaw, it lies in some of the fight sequences.  Done in close-ups and quick cuts, they can get frustrating for those who wantto see more of Batman's fighting style.  However, this is very minor since the story never ceases to grasp your attention.     In the end, Nolan and his superb cast and crew succeed in achieving what was once thought impossible: the resurrection of a film franchise that, if not dead, was at least on life support. As a result, Batman is once again flying high and BATMAN BEGINS is a film that I wholeheartedly recommend.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|This is an amazing album! It is a must have for any CD rack.  <br />I will get my second copy of this album soon. <br /> <br />I outlined all the songs on this great album! <br /> <br />1. Telegraph Road 5/5 Excellent album opener, but it would be better as a closer. This is my favorite song on the album, it <br />is 14 minutes long and it rocks! The ending is really great. <br /> <br />2. Private Investigations 3/5 This song has some great acoustic <br />work on! I like this song pretty good, it is a favorite to most Straits fans! I like the last word on this song.  <br /> <br />3. Industrial Disease 5/5 One of my favorites on this album! <br />I like the part where the British guy is, it is really cool. <br />I think the whole song is really funny and great. It is a song <br />that I can listen to over and over again. <br /> <br />4. Love over Gold 4/5 This is got some really great acoustic guitar work. Nice vocals by Mark Knopfler. The ending is great. <br />All I can say it is great, but not a five star for me. <br /> <br />5. It Never Rains 5/5 One of my favorites on this album! It is <br />a great album closer. The ending is just awesome and has some great heavy metal in it. I think the whole song is just awesome! <br />One of their greatest songs of all time! <br /> <br />Well, that's it. <br /> <br />Thank you very much and I hope you buy it, and buy this along <br />with the all time great - Making Movies. <br />
B0009353IW|5.0|This is the kind of album that takes you on a trip through space and time as you're given a musical tour of Chavez Ravine circa 1950s.  The first time I listened to this album I knew it was something different and something very special.  It's an inspiring tribute to the music and people of Chavez Ravine.  It's also music at its best with clever lyrics and fantastic beats all wrapped together in a tightly produced album.  Don't forget to check out Chinito Chinito.  Try staying still when that plays.

B000063DI9|5.0|Is this album really the Progressive Metal masterpiece its hyped up to be, I say no. It is no more than a very good commercial pop metal album. When Iron Maiden went progressive with Somewhere In Time their popularity went down a tad, so too get their popularity up again they made an album full of catchy pop tunes. And it worked, their new commercial material actually got some airplay and instead of calling them sell outs everybody said it was progressive metal. Heres what I think of the songs.    1.Moonchild (4/5)- cool riff  2.Infinite Dreams (3.5/5)- starts off good but gets too unfocused after awhile  3.Can I Play With Madness (4/5)-a good song but pure pop  4.Evil That Men Do (4/5)- good song but again its pop  5.Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son (5/5)- best song on the album  6.Prophecy (3/5)- The riffing is cool but thats about it  7.Clairvoyant (3/5)- the opening verse is great but when the singing starts it gets killed, one of Iron Maidens most overated songs  8.Only The Good Die Young (4/5)- a nice melodic pop song    If you like Pop Metal/rock check this album out, if you like Progressive metal or hard rock you might also like it.    If you like this album you might also like:  Judas Priest- Turbo Lover  Dream Theater- Images and Words  Queensryche- Operation Mindcrime
0375704027|5.0|I'm not going to say anything that has already been said, but this is a novel of the highest quality. In my opinion, it equals or tops one of my favorite, Catcher in the Rye.    **interesting tidbit: Taiwanese rocker Wu Bai and his band China Blue recorded an excellent song called \\"Norwegian Wood\\",  inspired by the novel. This is interesting to me because the entire story was triggered by Watanabe hearing a certain song.
B000002ITW|4.0|The best songs on this set are undoubtedly the NY acoustic versions of \\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\" and \\"Don't Let it Bring You Down\\"; the stock of Four Way Street has been raised by the addition of the NY medley of \\"The Loner-Cinnamon Girl-Down By the River to the cd. The Y songs are haunting and introspective, while some of the other efforts, such as Still's 49 Bye Byes, come off as naive and sophomoric (although Black Queen, which is also available on the first Stephen Stills solo album, is an exception).  <br /> <br />Nash contributes some very worthwhile songs such as \\"Right Between The Eyes\\" and the recently added \\"King Midas in Reverse\\". Crosby's well harmonized \\"Lee Shore\\" is his best contribution, while \\"Triad\\" comes off as self indulgent.  <br /> <br />The \\"boogie\\" cuts (as Stills calls them) are prosaic and have never stood out as being particularly noteworthy. The gems on this cd are the acoustic numbers in the poetic vein of <br />\\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\". Some of the more politically oriented material is over wrought and dated and the record comes across as not being particularly polished in the sound and production. But this has enough classic material here and there to include in a good 70s folk/rock collection.
B000000OU0|2.0|How many times do i hear their songs on the radio.Id rather sit outside and watch the grass grow than listen to this CD.  <br />I was going to give it one star,but as i was falling to sleep after reading the track listing i accidently clicked 2 stars and was too tired to change it back.  <br />The only song worth half a star is Hotel California.  <br />Desperado is pure boring.  <br />Oh man im going to have to finish writing this review before i doze off. <br />
068987474X|1.0|I think this book is sexist to both men and women. Its a rediculas stereotype that lumps all variety of men into one ass hole much in the same way it assumes all women are weepy and sad about everything. <br /> <br />I've been friends with men who are too shy to ask their other friends out. I've approached men with success! To assume that there is no such thing as a shy man is absured. The book assumes that all men function on the same level no matter what their background or current situation is and frankly, that doesn't make any sense. <br /> <br />I have a problem with the basic premise that men can be \\"solved.\\" Its offensive to human kind. We are all individuals. And understanding one person is different from understanding the next. I know I would be offended if some man who'd just read a book about how to date women asked me out and tried to treat me like he's already figured me out. There is no one answer - and even if there was, it certainly wouldn't be \\"he's just not that into you\\" <br /> <br />If you are not feeling particularly empowered and need a good read to pick you up, I would suggest a book written by someone with ANY psychology or sociology experience instead of someone who works in a completely unrelated field by creating fictional characters for a television show.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Needless to say, I was very skeptical to hear that Gregory Maguire's brilliant novel, \\"Wicked,\\" was going to become a Broadway musical. I couldn't think of many novels less suited for it. Put simply, \\"Wicked\\" tells the life story of the Wicked Witch of the West from L. Frank Baum's \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\" -- all the way from the moment she's born until the moment Dorothy throws that bucket of water. In his book, Maguire took this premise and created a dark masterpiece of fantasy where the \\"wonderful\\" land of Oz was revealed as an angry and unsettling place rife with bigotry, religious persecution, and social unrest -- in short, a world not unlike our own. It was not a book for children, but it did have some serious things to say about good and evil, namely, are they merely illusions? Does evil come from who we are, or what we do, or neither? Do we need wickedness just as much as we need goodness?<br /><br />A Broadway musical, of course, must have a straightforward story, broad characters, and be family-friendly. Stephen Schwartz's adaptation of \\"Wicked\\" leaves much out and smoothes over the R-rated aspects of the story. The basic plot is still there: this is the tale of Elphaba, born with unnaturally green skin, shunned by her parents and the world. Sent off to a private academy, she meets Galinda, a spoiled and shallow upper-class girl who at first hates Elphaba, then becomes her unlikely best friend. The plot reveals how the duo are drawn in by the seductive power of the Wizard, and how their paths split: Galinda becomes Glinda, the beloved Good Witch of the North, and Elphaba is shaped by ambition, tragedy, and bitterness into the Wicked Witch we all know and fear.<br /><br />I can forgive the plot changes, just because the music is so good. Schwartz's songs are seminal Broadway: powerful, moving, funny, sad, and bold. Kristen Chenoweth makes Galinda wonderfully funny and obnoxious without turning her into a stereotype, and Idina Menzel gives the performance of her life as Elphaba. Joel \\"Cabaret\\" Grey is pitch-perfect as the dotty Wizard, and the other supporting actors hit all the right notes (my one complaint: the character of Fiyero, the love interest, is way too changed from the book. They should've resisted the urge to turn him into a generic Broadway hunk). And the songs? Well, there's the towering overture, followed by the equally towering opening number, \\"No One Mourns the Wicked.\\" Then there's the hilarious \\"What Is This Feeling?\\" which sends up all those clich&eacute;d \\"eternal friendship\\" songs in a duet of total and complete hatred. \\"Dancing Through Life\\" is one of those great seize-the-moment numbers that make you feel young again. There's the goofy \\"Popular,\\" the Vaudevillian \\"One Short Day,\\" and the stellar Act I closer, \\"Defying Gravity,\\" which is worth the price of the CD (Menzel's final high note blew me out of my seat). Grey gets his moment in the spotlight with the Wizard's song, \\"Wonderful.\\" Menzel and Norbert Leo Butz have an erotically-charged love duet with \\"As Long as You're Mine.\\" Chenoweth and Menzel reveal the true depths of friendship in \\"For Good,\\" and then comes the surprisingly sad finale. If Elphaba's story reminds people of Anakin Skywalker, well, the debate about what makes evil has been going on for ages. \\"Wicked\\" may not end the debate, but at least it shows that \\"good\\" and \\"wicked\\" are just words, labels, and everything is more complicated than it seems.<br /><br />I'm glad \\"Wicked\\" won the Tony, because it's a triumph. The plot is simplified, but the spirit of the book is still there, and I only hope it will make people a little wiser. And did I mention that Idina Menzel is AWESOME??? \\"Wicked\\" gets top marks.mance of her life as Elphaba.

B0007XT87G|4.0|Since few prog albums released in the last 15 years can even remotely be compared in quality to Porcupine Tree's amazing In Absentia, it should come as no surprise that Deadwing comes up a little bit short. Nevertheless, this is a wonderful album that, like In Absentia, richly rewards repeated listens.  <br /> <br />Steven Wilson is my favorite producer for a reason. Not only are his soundscapes beautiful, transparent, and soulful, but he is capable of adapting his ambient style to a wide range of projects. Deadwing is a testament to this adaptability. The guitars are brought farther into the forefront of the mix, the drums are given more frenetic grooves, and some of the ethereal quality of the vocal harmonies has been toned down. The result is a much more raw album, one that can often be described as rifftacular. The part-grunge, post-Zeppelin guitar hook of Shallow is the perfect example of this new facility with heaviness. The title track, opening the album with a quick electronic beat before settling down onto a rich bed of guitar chords and riffs, is a stunning highlight. Lazarus is a good shot at a Coldplay-ish radio ballad, and Arriving Somewhere But Not Here is unquestionably one of the best songs  <br /> <br />Deadwing loses a lot of momentum in its second half, however. The beginning of Open Car seems like an attempt to show prog credentials to the Dream Theater circle, but this has never been Porcupine Tree's bag, and the result is a haphazard wreck of a song. While this track redeems itself later in its course, the next two songs are disappointingly humdrum, and increasingly one realizes that the best moments of the album were past as soon as track six began. With the exception of Arriving Somewhere But Not Here and the title track, Deadwing does not contain any songs that harness the raw emotive might of tracks on In Absentia - Trains, .3, Heartattack in a Layby, or Collapse The Light Into Earth. As a result, this album does not hold attention as raptly as IA does.  <br /> <br />Despite its inconsistencies, Deadwing is still the kind of album that most bands ought to fall over themselves trying to make. It contains heartbreak, uplift, anger, and the sheer catharsis of a good hard rock-out section. It may not compare favorably to In Absentia, but I still consider it one of the essential releases of 2005. Recommended.

B000929AJQ|3.0|The first listen is the worst. Not good at all. Doesn't help that the opening track puts you to sleep, now I just skip it entirely and will probably never hear it again. It's hard to get used to such a stripped down sound after the elaborate epic majestic productions of the last two albums which sounded tremendous BTW. In comparison this sounds godawful.  <br />After hearing it several times it becomes an enjoyable diversion  <br />during the morning commute but nothing more which is appalling given the standards Trent has established with previous works. <br />

B0007Y08QA|2.0|I'm not sure what other movie these people saw, but it wasn't the same one I did. This movie was unoriginal, predictable, and boring! You know what is going on from the beginning!  <br /> <br />Do you find it enjoyable to watch a movie where you know for sure from the start that the dude is loosing his mind, and the whole movie is just his struggle to come to terms with that? If that's your idea of a fun time, then this movie is for you.  <br /> <br />There wasn't any doubt that the dude was loosing it! They never even tried to cover it up. Is it really plausible that there would be some grand conspiracy to ruin this loosers life? Could anybody be less important? The answer is no. Could this movie be any more predictable? And the answer is...this movie could be none more predictable.  <br /> <br />Sure, the ending sums everything up nicely, but once again, this could have easily been a nice twilight zone or outer limits, not a one hour and forty something minute movie. The people that said they liked this movie are the same kind of people who bid on a potato chip who looks like moses. They are reading way too much into something that just isn't there.  <br /> <br />Watch the featurette. The writer says he wanted to write a movie and he didn't care if nobody liked it. Well, good, cause I thought it was poop.
B00000DC4A|5.0|I have been listening to brayan since my college days...you know one of those high hormone times when you are fighting yourself :o) and your music is more about passion (or things similar) than any thing else. <br /> <br />Now what I am gonna say might surprise or even offend a lot of people but I think this is the most mature composition that ever came out of bryan. Its one of those CDs that you just pop  in and listen to every song not just one or two tracks. I rate the CD based on Lyrics, Music and the effect both have and this collection is the first time perfect blend of bryans husky voice, great guitar and simple realistic lyrics. To some they may not invoke a lot of passion...but hey Pink floyds Wall was a big hit (infact my fav too) i dont think it had passion instead it had sense. This is some thing similar. Its a maturing bryan singing more realistic songs ... thats all... :o) <br /> <br />my suggestion is if you liked his other albums ...chances that you will like this one are high ...chances that you will find it passionate I would say would be 30(Y)-60(N)....I would say give it a shot see how he has changed in all these years....:o)
B00005JKGO|5.0|As \\"La Dolce Vita\\" came to a close I was of the opinion that I had watched a lesser movie than what I had expected.  However, as the movie kept going through my mind the next day, I began to reflect on what a great movie LDV is.  The problem I had was the bad taste that the movie left me with.  I didn't realize that this was probably the result that the director, Fellini, intended. <br /> <br />\\"La Dolce Vita\\" shows us the life of an Italian journalist who has a knack for being in the midst of celebrities and the social elites.  Consequently he seems to drift from one party to another.  This starts out interesting because he keeps his wits about him; never too drunk, doesn't lose sight of the story he's after, is attentive to those that appeal to him, and carries himself as a leader.  However, we begin to see the gradual decline of his focus and control.  People he cares about seem to drift away from him.  He struggles to write and he struggles to cope with the bizarre demise of the one man whom he truly looked up to.  However, the party never stops and he hasn't figured out it's time to go home.  Ultimately we are generally either saddened or disgusted by the depths to which he has sunk.  The image of the \\"beautiful people\\" in LDV gradually turns from fun and frolic into a life without purpose.  So many of the parties we are witness to seem meaningless and boring.   <br /> <br />As in most any Fellini movie, there are many terrific scenes, bizarre people, and brilliant imagery.  The acting is terrific as is the direction.  However, the sound mixing was as bad as in \\"8 1/2\\" where the voices and lip movements were so out of sinc that it looked like an Italian movie dubbed in Italian.   <br /> <br />\\"La Dolce Vita\\" is three hours long which caught me off guard.  It doesn't seem that long because most every scene seems appropos to the theme of the movie.  I've only seen LDV once and I am sure this is a movie that will deliver new insights each time I see it again.  Itmay leave a viewer depressed but it may also make a viewer thankful for his mortgage, 40 hour a week job, and his kids that keep him busy another 40 hours a week.  Hopefully, that was Fellini's intent.
B0002S94OS|5.0|Lamb Of God truly amazed me when I heard this same album at my friends house. I liked it alot, so I asked him if he could burn me a copy, and after I went home, I put it in my stereo and listened to it.<br /><br />Wow...I have never heard such amazing, musicianship between the drums and bass and the 2 guitarists in this band...I've never heard so much intense, insane, violent, harsh music. The drummer is excellent and has excellent skills with his timing, his cymbal techniques, rudiments, and all that stuff. The bass player does well by keeping right with the double bass drums and rhythems of the drummer, and the 2 guitarists are just simply excellent in their playing. And as for Randy Blythe, the vocalist...I was just really amazed by his singing style and his lyrics. This band has so much talent, it's amazing. I don't understand why some people absolutley can't stand this band, if you don't like this band then somethings wrong, it takes talent to be able to write good songs lyrically and musically and it takes alot of time to do all that. These guys are truly talented, and alot of real musicianship really shows here. This album is simply a must-have for every heavy/hard/trash/death metal fan out there.<br /><br />By the way, my favorite songs on this album are Laid to Rest, The Faded Line, Omerata, Ashes of the Wake, and Remorse is for the dead, but all of the songs are really good. Buy this album now!
B00006JU7T|5.0|I have watched \\"Serpico\\" many times since it first came out.  It's one of those movies that brings me to an abrupt stop when I'm channel surfing although I don't come across it that much lately.  Many people may have forgotten or never knew the story of the New York City policeman named Frank Serpico.  However, his revelations about graft and corruption in the NYC Police Dept were a major event in the city.   <br /> <br />Al Pacino does a terrific job of bringing the character of Serpico to the screen.  His unassuming but tenacious effort to just be an honest cop makes for a different sort of hero.  From practically his first day on the job he is confronted by offers of bribes and he soon comes to realize that it is systematic throughout the force.  Every time he thinks he's found someone to hear his protests he's reminded that everyone is part of the problem or afraid to do anything about it.  The way the whole story is woven makes for an interesting movie but it is the acting that raises the level even higher.  This seems to be just the sort of role made for Al Pacino.  The script enables him to be more than just a cop.  There is a romantic and social side of Serpico.  However, that may only have been as an opportunity to show the effects of his obsession and frustration with reforming the system.  His achievement ends up being a pyrrhic victory. <br /> <br />Some of the scenes seemed a bit exagerated but my biggest complaint about \\"Serpico\\" is quality of the cinematography.  Each time I've seen it on TV it looked like we were watching a very used video.  I haven't purchased or seen a new DVD version but I trust someone was able to clean it up.  I hope so because it is an excellent movie.
0790729652|5.0|It is always the original which is best in the series. The 1989 blockbuster Batman delivers this. It is hard to talk great about the Batman series thanks to Joel Schummacher who took over and made the last two batman films: Forever and Batman and Robin both were terrible in thier own rights. But Tim Burton who directed this film and Returns got it right. The dark mood is there, and the way Gotahm is portrayed adds to the uniqueness to the film. Michael Keaton still is the best on screen Batman, as he says few words to add to the mystery. Kim Basinger at her hottest as reporter Vicki Vale, and off course Jack Nicholson as the Joker, how many great lines does this man deliver in this film!!! From: \\"wait til they get a load of me\\" to \\" this town needs an enema\\" every line is pure classic Nicholson. Let us also not forget a great supporting cast including Robert Wuhl, Jerry Hall, Jack Palance, Billy Dee Williams, and Michael Gough as Alfred. To this day it is still the greatest Batman ever made. One of the crimes of this century is that Tim burton didn't direct the third and fourth Batman, which is why they both were lame. But the first still the best.. but i could be wrong when i see another great actor named Christian Bale don the bat suit in Batman Begins, unitl then the first is the best. two thumbs way up!
B0006L16N8|5.0|If you're interested in hearing a well recorded album, then you should get \\"X&Y.\\" Technically and artistically it's very good. It sounds very professional. One of the best albums of 2005 so far. \\"X&Y\\" is a landmark in one shape or form.
B00005JLCI|5.0|I was, like most high school students, bombarded with Hamlet I must of read it at least once a year but my sophmore year I not only had to read it in my english class but my theatre class was required to read it and watch the 3 main versions Olvier, Mel Gibson and this one.. most of my generation prefer the Mel Gibson version but I find it short and choppy I instanly fell in love with this version This movie really changed my opinon of shakespeare/theatre all around and I am now a Theatre education major. I have since purchased some of Kenneth Branagh's other shakspeare works on DVD I highly recommend Othello it puts and interesting twist on the characters much like Hamlet,I am anxiously waiting for this one to be released on DVD have been since 2000 when I first watched saw it.
0066620996|2.0|This book was recommended by some friends.  I began it with an open mind, believing that perhaps Collins had performed a true scientific, or at least logical, study.  However, I soon found that the \\"study\\" he conducted held little weight.  Collins and his people essentially conducted a \\"look back\\" study.  It is the type of study that produces results of no use.  These types of studies are discounted continuously in the scientific community. It would be similar to me comprising years of NFL data and finding that teams with blue in their uniforms and QBs named Bob win 60% more games that teams with red uniforms and QBs named Hank.  It doesn't mean anything.  If all of the CEOs of the \\"great\\" companies had mustaches, would Collins suggest that this was a key element as well.  The only true study that could be conducted would be for Collins to set up two companies: one with all of the characteristics of a \\"great\\" company that he has \\"discovered\\" and one without.  If the former company succeeds and the later fails and all else is equal, then I'll listen.  To perform an experiment like that and keep everything else equal is nearly as impossible as putting what it takes a good company to become great in 250+ pages.  Bad try!
B0001IMKTA|5.0|This is Spocks Beard's first album and it has some awsome stuff.  It may take a little while to get into at first but after 5 or so listens I just couldn't get enough.  It is basically the same as the original release but it is remastered so the quality is lightyears better than the original release.  If you like Pink Floyd, Yes or Rush, you should definitaly get this album and along with every other Spock's release up to Feel Euphoria.  The Light and The Water are the two most notable tracks on the album, but the two other ones are good also.  The Water is their first epic, and it is truly amazing.  The light is also great, really interesting melodies and riffs.  The song(and the album) may sound cheesy at first but keep listening, it will grow on you.    But if your a fan of progressive music, nothing should sound cheesy. ;)
B00097A5HW|5.0|It's no surprise that Shakira has made a good record.  All her albums have been good and have sold very successfully. This new album follows her crossover English album Laundry Service, which was, honestly, very good for a first English album.  This new album seems more polished off.  Her mix of songs and different styles within the album is incredible. Shakira has once again raised the bar!
B0009HLDFU|2.0|So, I'm a big fan of The Foo Fighters, but this cd is just not good. The acoustic cd is the only reason I bothered rating this album, because really, when it comes down to it, the first cd, supposedly the \\"rockin\\" cd, just doesn't have anything good. I can't pretend to understand what they're going through in their lives right now; maybe the first cd is filled with emotion for them, but it just comes across as really commercial and dead. Even the melodies are pretty boring. Although I'm not a big fan of the album or single One By One atleast that song made you wanna be onstage rockin out with them. Their best cd will always be their first as far as I'm concerned. With each subsequent release they've become more produced and it's frustrating when really the Foo were the last of a few popular real rock bands, along with QOTSA (who've also apparently dumbed down their rocking with their latest release). The acoustic cd is good, and I do enjoy it, but I want to be able to depend on the Foo for loud rock music, this album does not deliver. Anyone reading this most likely already has the other Foo cd's, but if you don't, go buy their self titled cd and listen to Wattershed, that's the Foo I wanna hear.
B00004YYDI|5.0|I find it strange the movie is titled &#34;Leon&#34; because it really revolves around the life of Mathilda.<br /><br />I bought this movie just because I caught a glimpse of the editted version and was intrigued by their relationship. It was clear that Leon, a 40 something year old man, and Mathilda, a 12 year old girl, were falling in love with one another despite the disparity in age.<br /><br />I think Mathilda was a fascinating character, mostly because of her boldness at such a young age. Clearly she is aware of her sexuality, both the character and the actress. And that is what made her acting so convincing.<br /><br />It's obvious that Mathilda is not sexually attracted to Leon, nor is Leon sexually attracted to her. This makes these scenes non-pedophile in nature. However Mathilda desperately wants to express her love for Leon and thinks that sex is the best way to do it. She's not uncomfortable with the idea of sex because it's about love, not sex. Leon refuses for fear of experiencing that level of intimacy again, and he is uncomfortable with the idea of having sex with a 12 year old girl.<br /><br />In one scene, Mathilda states matter-of-factly how having sex with him will be a good thing. Leon then begins to explain with great emotion what happened to the first and last woman he loved, and why he chooses to live alone.<br /><br />At this point, and in the end of the movie, their feelings and love are expressed. It's the circumstances of their life, the violence and the drama, and the unique people that they are, that causes them to care so deeply for one another. I only wished the movie ended on a happy note rather than tragedy, but this also gives the drama of their story realism- life likewise is often a harsh reality. Tragedy also makes the story much more memorable, and forces you to appreciate it more.<br /><br />I'm definitely glad I got the uncut version, but I would recommend as others did to get the 2 disc edition as you get more extras with it (like interviews).<br /><br />There seems to be some controversy over the scenes that portrayed Natalie Portman's character in a sexy way, but this only emphasized her love for Leon. Because clearly it was not primarily sexual desire, but came from a deep sense of love (caring, appreciation, respect). She didn't try to kiss him or seduce him in earnest, but merely to show what she was willing to do for him because she loved him so much. Which I suspect Leon recognized and also why he refused her.t (like interviews).<br /><br />There seems to be some controversy over the scenes that portrayed Natalie Portman's character in a sexy way, but this only emphasized her love for Leon.

B00005JLR2|2.0|You let all the fat aliens die (except for Meltdown)! How could you? Snuff, Hands and Meltdown are my favorite characters!All of them should have lived. Why not kill Onus, Bird Brain, Oxy and Moron instead? If you'd do that, it would save my belly from losing another 4 stone.
B00001U0E1|5.0|when i first saw this movie i didn't know what to expect, i am <br />a big fan of william shakespeare. my favorite play is romeo and <br />juliet, i think joseph fiennes and gwyneth paltrow were wonder- <br />ful in this movie and gwyneth made a beautiful juliet. i always <br />thought that joseph fiennes should play in a shakespeare play <br />especially as romeo but this is even better. i love period piece <br />movies and this one is the best of all. but i think they could <br />have showen rupert everett more.
B0000AK7AA|2.0|I can't believe Fatso gets sucked up in the vaccuum. I mean, come on, Fatso is probably the fattest thing I've ever seen, so how could he fit inside it? And also, what the devil did Fatso do to deserve it? All Fatso did was jab at Dr. Harvey with his weapon, but missed, and tickle him. That's all he did. And Stretch and Stinky harm Dr. Harvey. Stretch cuts off Dr. Harvey's trousers, and Stinky makes the place stink. Poor Fatso, he gets sucked up in the vaccuum all for nothing. He should get free pizzas and fast food 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I love Fatso He is a major inspiration to me. I'mgoing to avenge him by being just like him.
0385334206|3.0|I first read this in 1997 at the age of 25 and thought this book was funny and brilliant.  I reread it again a few days ago and now think that it is just \\"pretty good\\".  It seems dated in some areas and in others it does not seem very \\"deep\\" at all.  For instance Vonnegut gives this very childish definition of capitalism as being very unfair and communism as being the most rational form of an economy.  He wants us to think that if we all looked at complex social processes like children we would all see that we should switch to communism because everyone shares (even though everyone including Vonnegut himself) should know that this is impossible.  I also do not understand why he keeps on telling me the measurements of some of his characters.  Maybe it was funny 8 years ago but after he does this in the novel twice it is no longer really funny  and he gives measeurements of characters about 30-40 times.  If you are under 30 years old and politically liberal you will love this book otherwise I would not recommend it.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I purposely waited to write this review until I had listened to X&Y several times. I'm glad I did. This is an incredible recording. Every song, including the bonus track, is well crafted and worthy of careful attention. There is a fullness to their sound now that transcends the individual insturments being played, with Martins voice soaring above and, at times, in and out of each melody. I was shocked to hear negative reviews stating that it sounds to \\"coldplayish\\". What on earth does that mean? I bought it anticipating their sound, not in anticipation of some mutated, experimental version of Coldplay (Remember U2 tried that and fortunately we got them back). Rather than compare this recording to their first two I will just say this: Any band that can create music of this caliber after two amazing previous efforts deserves profound respect. They certainly have mine.
B000957O82|5.0|MY DVD ARRIVED THIS MORNING, AND, RELUCTANTLY I WATCHED IT, THAN I WATCHED AGAIN! IT IS THE MOST CHARMING, UNUSUAL COMEDY I'VE SEEN IN YEARS! WILL, KEVIN, EVA THE ENTIRE CAST GAVE IT THEIR ALL TO MAKE THIS ONE OF THIS YEARS MOST DELIGHTFUL DVDS! AND THE FINALE, WELL NO SPOILERS HERE, BUT IT WAS TOTALLY WONDERFUL! EVERYONE CAN DANCE, CHARM, AND MAKE US GET LOST IN THE MOST WONDERFUL COMEDY OF THE YEAR. BRAVO MR. TENNANT, AND KUDOS TO THE ENTIRE CAST FOR PULLING THE WHOLE PACKAGE OFF! I TRULY LOVED IT-IT WAS THE MEDICINE I NEEDED FOR 2 WONDERFUL HOURS.   IT'S NOT TO BE MISSED.
B00092ZL80|5.0|I've been a Chicago fan all my life and if you haven't heard this band's music from the 60's-70's, this band can rock.  I've never heard a better guitarist than Terry Kath, but unfortunately he's since passed away (1978).  If you like Hendrix, Terry Kath is better, he taught Hendrix half of what he knew and was the only guitarist to literally floor Hendrix because Hendrix was so amazed by his performance.  So unfortunately his presence is not on this dvd, but the band would agree, he's the biggest loss that band could have ever suffered.   The music still lives on and I went to this concert in 2004 in Camden NJ and will be going again this July 2005.  Of all the concerts I've been to, it was the best concert I've been to by far and I expect this year's round to be even better.  I'm not a huge fan of R&B, but when EW&F groups up with Chicago to make a 20 manned stage performance, it's out of this world.  This DVD is a must get.
B00004U8H4|5.0|Unlike a lot of adaptations of novels I've seen, I have no desire to read the book.  This film's amazing.  I have no interest in influencing my views of it.  On the topic of \\"editions\\", the rated version is the one to buy.  I have the unrated one and the extra footage adds nothing.  The sex scene actually flows into the surrounding film better in the cut version.  The print they telecined to DVD also doesn't look as early a generation as the rated one, which is a little more crisp, clean, and vibrant than this one.  I remember the rated rental having very pure whites in the opening scene, and the lunch scene with Willem Defoe was more vibrant and rich looking.  There seems to be generation loss with the unrated version, or I could just be remembering it wrong. I have not seen the new Killer's collector edition, though.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Right now, Coldplay IS the best band in the world. No disrespect to anyone else, but Coldplay is bringing the goods big time. They're pulling ahead. The material on \\"X&Y\\" just stands out way above what anyone else is currently doing. Their talent is only more obvious with their latest offering. \\"X&Y\\" is a masterpiece. There are no other words to describe it. I can't stop playing it. Every time I listen to it, it just gets better. Everything about the band improved for this record. I would definitely recommend people getting this CD.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|mmmmm buy it, if you like Eric Clapton (or good music). <br />my best music dvd is this one.
B000002UJQ|2.0|Not a big brit music fan but was compelled to listen because of the buzz. Explain to me why this is so great. If there's a theme here i don't get it. Some decent guitar playing but that doesn't really make it a \\"Classic\\". I guess standards of excellence have to be lowered due to the lack of any real intelligence or passion in modern rock music. Buy a Shellac  album instead.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I am mostly into stuff like Led Zeppelin and Eric Clapton, but this is a great CD. Mike White uses a lot of hevy over drive whith his guitar in the songs...and the lyrics dont make a lot of sence but there rock hard.....very hard. any one who likes rock and roll needs this cd. some of the best songs on this cd are \\"the air between my fingers\\" \\"ball and bisket\\" well.....the whole cd i think is really good.
068987474X|5.0|With all due respect to the authors, here are the positive and negatives:<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />The title says it all - sometimes we try to force men into what we wish they felt.  You can't force someone to like you or find you attractive.  Too many women waste years of their lives waiting for a spark from a guy that never comes.  When a guy really likes you, there is no question about it - no mistaking it - he lets you know in no uncertain terms.  To settle for anything less degrades a woman's confidence in herself.  Most women need more confidence, not less.<br /><br />The interesting thing is that most guys let a woman know this loud and clear - that he isn't really \\"that interested.\\" But sometimes we only hear what we wish were true - or hope will be true in the future.<br /><br />Time is precious - don't waste it on a guy who really is \\"just not that into you.\\"<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />While I completely agree with the concept of the book, I can't recommend this book personally because it states that if a man is not sleeping with you, then he is not interested in you. This does a disservice to the many people who believe in waiting for marriage or who don't believe in jumping in the sack with someone they have not known a long time.<br /><br />Assumptions that sex is expected with every dating relationship can have a huge influence on young readers who WILL read this book and be permanently influenced by it.<br /><br />I also read in the book that by the time you are a few weeks or months into a relationship, you should be discussing whether or not to have #### sex. Perhaps they meant this as humorous in part, but only in part. This comment in the book was graceless at best, and believe me, it's not what you want your teen daughter taking home.  Take a look and see for yourself. You'll be more than stunned.<br /><br />So many times I have learned that you can't judge a book by its title. You have to read it before you assume that it's as great as it seems on the surface.
B000002J09|5.0|From one of the greatest bands of all time comes one of the greatest albums of all time. thats all to be said.
B000002MY3|5.0|This perhaps is one of the most impressive debut albums of a rocker ever!  The first time I listened to this CD, I was cleaning my room and I thought, \\"Man, she can't sing!\\" I was very disapointed, but, after I listened to it while I followed along reading the lyrics as she sang I began to really like this CD.  It is so good!  She brings so much attention to her lyrics and her messages - I can't stand it!  At first her singing seemed bad, but, after listening to it many times, I have fell in love with it!  She is so good, the top of her game!
B00005JNTZ|5.0|When I first saw the commercials for Veronica Mars before is debut last summer, I wasnt all that interested but after watching the first episode, I was hooked.  Kristen Bell does an excellent job as the shows brilliant and witty Veronica Mars.  The supporting characters are also fabulous, such as Veronicas father Keith, played by Enrico Collantoni (Just Shoot Me's Elliot) and like Jason Dohring, who plays Logan Eckles, Veronica's best friends ex who is also one of the top \\"09ers\\" who cant seem to keep his smart comments to himself.  The shows writing and directing is amazing, with the many interesting plot twists and love triangles and if i could, i would give it more than five stars.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|I have been playing guitar since 1970, maybe not that well, but...  The musicians that I know who have seen and heard this DVD really like it.  I like it... allot!  There is plenty to complain about if you are a nitpicker, rather than a guitar picker.  I prefer to evaluate the merit of such a product on whether I enjoy the experience.  I did not intend any other result than to see and hear some great musicians do their thing, and that is what I got, in spades!  The few whiners who wrote negative reviews missed that point entirely.  This is great value for the dollar.
B0006SSOHC|3.0|I enjoyed the movie and if you did too, I would recommend reading books by Richard Laymon. In specific a book called In the Dark, but really any of his other books have the same kind of perverse twistedness of Saw.
B00008V5VN|5.0|It's good that there are things in the world that are absurdly <br />huge, ludicrously long, deeply heavy.  This album is one of them. <br /> <br />This review, on the other hand, is not. <br /> <br />This album *is* cool.  Check it out.
0380789035|4.0|The premise of Neil Gaiman's book is not particularly original: at least 2 original series Trek episodes (\\"Who Mourns for Adonis?\\" and \\"Squire of Gothos\\") are basically the same idea.  To wit: the gods are real, and they walk the Earth.  They grow powerful when people worship them, weaken when indifference sets in, and die when people forget them.  However, to my great delight, Gaiman has created a novel unlike any other - part travelogue, part suspense-thriller, and part action-adventure.  There is also an ample sampling of humour.<br /><br />Perhaps the most original part of the book is the selection of gods Gaiman chooses.  Some will be known to most readers - Odin, Easter, Jaquel (the Egyptian god with the head of a Jackel), and Kali (made famous for my generation by Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom). But many more were completely unknown to me.  I was reminded of the quote, \\"stealing from one person is plaigerism, stealing from everyone is genius.\\"  Gaiman selects a few gods from many different pantheons and throws them together on a quest - to defend themselves from the hostile takeover by the new gods of Television, the Internet, etc.<br /><br />Such a synopsis makes the novel sound silly, but somehow Gaiman makes it work and lends it the gravity it deserves.  After all, if it's one thing that the old gods lack, it's a sense of humour.  We are taken through the trip by Shadow, who early on throws his lot in with Odin.  His wife has been killed in a car accident, but apparently the gold coin (given to him by a leprechaun) he drops on her grave brings her back in some sort of undead state.  More than once she bails Shadow out, then disappears to take a job at a gas station because, after all, even the undead need to pay the rent!<br /><br />The interest and fun of the story is in the writing.  It is fascinating to see gods unknown to me, but some of his choices I have to question.  After all, wouldn't more people know Zeus than Odin, and if so, why wouldn't Zeus be the head guy instead?  Such details are only puzzling after the fact.  While reading the book, it's very enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />P.S. The book won the Hugo, even though it is patently not a science fiction story.uldn't Zeus be the head guy instead?  Such details are only puzzling after the fact.

I was not disappointed with the rest of the album either. It's very reminiscent of some of Trent's other albums. It's like With Teeth is The Downward Spiral's bastard child & she doesn't know whether The Fragile or Pretty Hate machine is the father.  <br /> <br />Once again, listeners can marvel at & relate to Trent's dark, emotional, pain-filled lyrics. The music ranges from new wave to techno industrial. Trent Reznor is a damn genius. I hope he never stops making music.
B00005RRG9|5.0|I never write reviews, but thought I had to do so, after reading Spanish Jack's comment.  There is no need for me to tell you about the film because the other reviewers already did.  While Spanish Jack may have had some good intentions in his writing, he ultimately could close the doors on viewers who appreciate the arts and classics, but are not white.  This movie is a family, fun-loving movie for anyone who truly appreciates a combination of great acting, a well-told story and even pace.  It's comical without stupidity or obscene language.  Even though the cast is all white -- as most classics were in that time period, it is a movie to be enjoyed by all races and all age groups regardless of your family situation.  You will not be disappointed.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Wow! How do you spell `Wow\\" backwards? Sorry, that is an inside joke, a reference to my review of Christopher Nolan's \\"Memento\\", but an equally fitting reference to my feelings about Christopher Nolan's re-imagining of \\"Batman Begins\\".<br /><br />Ducard (Liam Neeson) waits for Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) in a jail cell, somewhere in Asia. He tells Wayne about a mysterious group of men he works with, who train to rid the world of evil. Arranging for his release, Ducard tells him how to find their camp. There, Wayne meets Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe, \\"The Last Emperor\\"), the leader of the League of Shadows, a group of highly trained men determined to make the world a safe place. Upon completion of his training, Wayne travels back to Gotham and finds the city in a state of decay. His former girlfriend, Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) is a District Attorney working to clean up the increasingly corrupt political system. She realizes that a psychiatrist, Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy, \\"28 Days Later\\"), is transferring all of a local crime lord's (Tom Wilkinson) henchmen into his custody at Arkum Asylum. Alfred (Michael Caine) welcomes Wayne back to his ancestral home, Wayne Manor. As Bruce announces his plans, Alfred becomes a confidant and assistant. Meeting Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), an inventor employed by Wayne Industries, Wayne begins to assemble the arsenal necessary for his transformation to Batman. As he begins to fight the evil in Gotham, he meets Sergeant Gordon (Gary Oldman), perhaps the last honest cop in Gotham.<br /><br />I am a big fan of the Tim Burton \\"Batman\\" films, especially the first one. But Christopher Nolan (\\"Memento\\", \\"Insomnia\\") has created a whole new vision of the character. I never really read a lot of superhero comic books as a kid. To me, the whole fun of watching the film versions is to witness the mythology of these characters. Some of the characters, like Batman, Superman and Spider Man, have been in our culture for so long they have reached the level of myth. Who doesn't know at least a little of the story of Superman's creation? Or Batman's? In \\"Batman Begins\\", Nolan creates a detailed, interesting, exciting film about the origins of Bruce Wayne and his superhero alter ego.<br /><br />Fitting a lot of information into the film, Nolan moves things along at a breakneck pace. A lot is going on, but it is easy to follow as well because the director uses words, actions, visual references and more to inform us. Isn't this what all directors should do? But how many are successful? This is a tribute solely to the writer and director. As we watch Wayne go through his training, Nolan inserts flashbacks to Wayne's childhood, giving us a glimpse of the fears that have so far shaped his life. The training includes a terrific sequence in which Wayne has to find a particular man, standing amongst identically dressed warriors, as the men move in unison, before fighting him. Upon his return to Wayne Manor, the other characters enter the picture and we learn about them. This is one of the best things about the film; there is so much going on. Just because the film is about a comic book superhero, Nolan didn't feel it necessary to dumb down the plot or the characters or make it simplistic. This is a film for young (well, not too young) and old alike.<br /><br />There is also a significant amount of humor peppered throughout the film. Wayne's relationships with Alfred (Caine) and Lucius (Freeman) create a lot of the humor, and warmth for that matter, in his life. In one scene, Alfred explains that Wayne needs to keep up appearances as a billionaire playboy, if he wants to divert attention from his alter ego. Therefore, he arrives at a party, in a flashy car, with two models sitting in the passenger seat. Alfred becomes less a butler and more a confidant to Wayne, more so than in any other incarnation of the story. And this works brilliantly, providing him with a sense of history, reason and grounding.<br /><br />The look of the film is also fantastic. Using real sets, for the most part, the action has a sense of urgency and place. Thankfully, they didn't use CGI to recreate everything, as they did in \\"Star Wars Episode III\\". It is my understanding that Chicago provided the backdrop for Gotham, with embellishments created by CGI. When you see it, you will understand why this is so important. Obviously, there is a significant amount of CGI work involved, but using a real backdrop gives the setting a quality that has been lacking in other films lately. All of this work helps to create the world these characters live in, making everything more believable. Because we believe Gotham really exists, the action, the danger and the story all are more believable.<br /><br />Christian Bale is a really good actor. One thing that can be said of all of his performances is that they are interesting. You might not like the character, or the film, but at least they were interesting. As Bruce Wayne, Bale brings a solemn air, an intensity that works. Wayne has some dark moments in his past and his upbringing and Bale is the right choice for this part. He is also able to inject humor and a lighthearted quality, at times, making the character three dimensional and interesting. When we experience a flashback of a traumatic event in his childhood, it is a very moving moment, because it brings us closer to Bale's portrayal of Wayne.<br /><br />Let's face it, the supporting cast is fantastic. Any movie that has Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Tom Wilkinson, Gary Oldman, Ken Watanabe, Rutger Hauer and Liam Neeson isn't going to be bad. And \\"Begins\\" is great, in large part due to the superb work of these actors, Cillian Murphy and even the future Mrs. Tom Cruise. The key to the success of all is that they are all playing the roles seriously. Yes, some of them have slightly humorous moments, but overall, they believe in these characters, their world, their actions. I know I sound like a broken record, but because they believe, we believe.<br /><br />Michael Caine, in particular, stands out. This, for me, was the most exciting casting choice in the film. The moment I learned that he had been cast to play Alfred, I was very excited. It is such perfect casting. In the role, Caine brings a layer of depth and conviction to the character we haven't seen before. Alfred has invested so much of his life in this family that he deeply cares about their legacy. This is a nice touch to the character and adds a certain amount of gravitas to the role.<br /><br />Cillian Murphy is also great as Dr. Jonathan Crane. Completely believable, he brings a real sense of menace, creating a memorable villain whose plan is very diabolical and multifaceted. Again, Nolan keeps what could be a complicated idea understandable, by revealing various aspects throughout the story. Murphy is also completely convincing as an American psychiatrist, even though he is Irish. There is no trace of his accent. Murphy has created a small handful of very good performances and appears to be poised to continue this streak.<br /><br />The story, as mentioned before, is very detailed. Towards the end, there are a few plot twists which surprised me. And I am almost never surprised by plot twists. They are developed well throughout and add a nice layer, creating additional suspense and intrigue.<br /><br />Nolan also manages to keep the film dark, much like Film Noir, without going too far over the edge. Gotham is drenched in shadow, the streets riddled with crime. The hero and the tone throughout are dark, but broken up by some great action scenes and light hearted humor. As the villain's plan begins to unfold, the story becomes darker and may be too intense for little children. For kids over a certain age, and adults, this just helps the film become that much more... you, know, believable.<br /><br />There are some terrific action sequences throughout the film. In a couple, as Batman fights the bad guys, the scenes are presented in a unique, almost impressionistic fashion. A glimpse of Batman rappelling down, a shot of thugs getting their heads knocked together, a brief look at another crook flying into the air with Batman. This is a unique idea. Generally, we see every fist hitting flesh, every cut, every ounce of blood spilling. In \\"Begins\\", a lot of the action is suggested to us, leaving our minds to sort out the actual details. This idea works really well.<br /><br />The film also has one of the coolest beginnings I have seen in a long time. Again, rather impressionistic, the opening credits suggest rather than inform.<br /><br />Generally, I can't stand the thought of a sequel. Can't anyone do anything original in Hollywood? They always have to rely on a sequel? \\"Batman Begins\\" was made because Warner Bros. wanted to reenergize the franchise. And Nolan has done that. At the end of the film, there is a brief coda setting up the inevitable sequel.

B000006NPY|5.0|There are records that everytime you hear them they take you back to a certain time and place in your life so vividly that the smells, the exact dialogues you had at the the time come back word for word, scent by scent. And for me, \\"Adore\\" is one of those records.<br /><br />I remember I got \\"Adore\\" the Saturday after it came out at a Circuit City in Atlanta, Ga, excited as I had ever been to hear a new record(I was only fifteen at the time). As soon as I got home I put the record in my cheap K-Mart bought C.D. player and put the headphones on, ready to be thrilled, taken back, surprised, enthralled, whatever overly used adjective you can think of. And I was. Instantly I loved \\"Adore\\". It was the soundtrack of my summer of 1998 and has pretty much been the soundtrack to every one of my winters since(in addition to the Cure's \\"Disintigration\\")<br /><br />So to put it simply, I love this record. This is my favorite Smashing Pumpkins record by a mile, the one I come back to time and time again. It was dismissed as just another attempt of a rock band trying to utilize electronic/ techno elements to stay contomporary(U2's \\"Pop\\", Bush's remix record, David Bowie's \\"Earthling\\") but those people had it wrong all along. The electronic elements for the most part are not the basis of the songs, but rather atmospherics to add to the feel of the record. This is, for lack of a better word, a lullabye of a record, a quiet, introspective, sad, intimate album that is better when heard as one part as opposed to being held accountable for only a few songs.<br /><br />\\"Ava Adore\\" rocks an electronic drum beat to a sublime chorus, where \\"Perfect\\" is pretty obviously a successor of sorts to \\"Mellon Collie's\\" hit \\"1979\\". \\"Daphne Descends\\" is the most electronic track on the album, but also in my opinion the best, a wall-of-noise instrumental with one of Corgan's most plainitive and open vocals ever.<br /><br />\\"Crestfallen\\" is simply heartbreaking, where \\"Apples+Oranges\\" and \\"Behold! TheNight Mare\\" are darker tinged pop songs with instant melodies and enough going on to make you return to them again and again. And I dare you not to get excited and heartbroking when the guitar solo to the majestic and top notched \\"For Martha\\" kicks into high gear.<br /><br />The record also finds Corgan in a more subdued mood then he ever was, or has been, before. There are no epic anthems to teen angst and suburban suffering(one thing that probably hurt the record sales wise) but instead meditations on death, love, faith and where all three collide. It is Corgan's masterpiece lyrically, a record that finds the personal in the universal and vice versa.<br /><br />I don't care if this is the cool Pumpkins record to like. It's of little consequence to me. By the time the piano outro finishes all I ever want to do is press repeat and start it all over again. There is absolutly nothing I dislike about this record, from the packaging(this record has one of the prettiest booklets I have ever seen) to the music to the execution. I love this record and is one of my favorites of all time.<br /><br />And if you give it a shot I'm sure you will love it too.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|I've been reading, with some amusement, the chagrin about a new DVD release of JAWS, 5 years after the original one. <br /> <br />Wow. Considering the way the DVD industry operates, I think this rerelease after 5 long years shows restraint in a world of superduper special editions coming out months after the original releases these days. <br /> <br />Beisdes, when the original came out, many fans of the movie were demanding an re-release of it right away because: <br /> <br />1. The movie's original soundtrack was supplanted by a 5.1 remix. The remix actually used different sound effects and foley work than the original. For fans of the film who know it like the back of thier hand (you can count this author as one of them)the changes were readily apparent and distracting. I have no problem with 5.1 remixes. Most of them take the original sound effects, music and dialog and give some spaciousness to them. But I want them to remain an option instead of a replacement, especially when the soundtrack is as radically altered as JAWS's track was. <br /> <br />2. The documentary carried over from the laserdisc was cut in half to fit it on the same disc as the movie. I had access to the full documentary so it wasn't too much an issue for me. <br /> <br />So, when a re-release was announced all I wanted to know is if the DVD had the original soundtrack and I would buy it. If it didn't, there was no reason to buy it. <br /> <br />Which is, when you think about it, a good process for all double dipping releases. If the additions float your boat, go for it, if they don't, don't complain about it. <br /> <br />So, I got the DVD today for less than $14.00, it includes 60 page booklet in it which is nice. I'm happy because the soundtrack I got to know JAWS with is on the DVD. <br /> <br />So, in short, this re-release after 5 years corrects all the issues that fans of the movie had with the first release and has a nice little book to go along with it. <br /> <br />I'm not complaining
B000002UUH|3.0|When The Beatles broke up, each of the four members would embark on solo recording careers.   Each of the four members would achieve some level of commercial success and each would have a #1 song as a solo artist. However, each member would also embark on different musical styles that would become his signature as a recording artist.   For Paul McCartney and John Lennon, the bar would always be set higher.   This is because this duo was the primary songwriting tandem for the biggest band in Rock history.   However, McCartney and Lennon's solo careers - while commercially successful often became the subject of criticism in the music community.   In some respects, I think this criticism was justified.   For John Lennon, much of this criticism was wrapped around his relationship with Yoko Ono - who played a role in John's music throughout the 1970s.  One of the most tragic things about Lennon's death in 1980 was that he was just beginning to regain his creative edge that he had with The Beatles - namely his \\"Double Fantasy\\" album.   Lennon's solo work from his beginnings with the experimental Plastic Ono Band through his final album \\"Double Fantasy\\" (just released before his death) are covered on the 1982 compilation \\"The John Lennon Collection\\". <br /> <br />One ingredient that made The Beatles so successful was having George Martin as a producer.   While it is ok to have an artist produce himself, I think the presence of a third-party as a producer is key.   This is part of the problem I think that plagued Lennon and McCartney at various points of their individual solo careers.   Both McCartney and Lennon needed that \\"push\\" to get the most out of their powerful creative juices.   If you take a look at what seems to be the strongest material in \\"The John Lennon Collection\\", it is when Lennon worked with producers Phil Spector and Jack Douglas.   Spector, has always been a source of controversy with Lennon - and especially during the breakup of The Beatles, but Spectorproduced terrific tracks like \\"Instant Karma!\\", \\"Happy Xmas\\", and the legendary track \\"Imagine\\".  Douglas was responsible for producing very personal \\"Double Fantasy\\".  Lennon does have some points where he produces himself and does well (\\"#9 Dream\\" and \\"Mind Games\\"), but there are also songs where he clearly needs that push (such as \\"Cold Turkey\\") <br /> <br />One thing I normally like about greatest hits collections is when the songs are arranged in chronological order. This allows me to hear how the artist has progressed across time.  In the case of Lennon, his solo career started out with some very experimental and tracks that were more socio-political l in nature (\\"Power to the People\\" and \\"Give Peace a Chance\\").  By the mid 1970s he was doing things a little-more mainstream (such as his cover of Ben E. King's \\"Stand By Me\\").   After his 5 year hiatus, John would come back with a most personal album \\"Double Fantasy\\".  This album was much more reflective on John as a personal and also dealt with his wife and newborn son.  In the case of \\"The John Lennon Collection\\", it does not go in chronological order - thus you don't see how Lennon transformed as an artist during this period. <br /> <br />There are other John Lennon Collections in the marketplace that can also be considered: <br /> <br />\\"Shaved Fish\\" - This is an early compilation of John's work that was released in 1975.  It includes the following songs that were not released on LP:  \\"Instant Karma,\\" \\"Cold Turkey,\\" and \\"Happy Xmas (War Is Over).\\"  It includes two tracks not on \\"The John Lennon Collection\\". <br /> <br />\\"Lennon Legend: The Very Best of John Lennon\\": This is a 1997 compilation includes all, but 4 of the \\"The John Lennon Collection\\" songs (\\"Stand By Me\\", \\"I'm Losing You\\", \\"Dear Yoko\\", and \\"Move Over Ms. L\\").   It does include two songs from Lennon's posthumous album \\"Milk and Honey\\" (Nobody Told Me\\" and \\"Borrowed Time\\" that was released after \\"The John Lennon Collection\\".  <br /> <br />\\"Lennon\\": This is a Four-CD boxed set and is the most comprehensive collection of Lennon's solo work.  All of the songs from \\"The John Lennon Collection\\" are on here with the exception of \\"Move Over Ms. L\\". <br /> <br />One interesting thing about \\"The John Lennon Collection\\" is that this focuses on John himself.  Throughout his solo career, John gave credit to Yoko Ono on several of the tracks.   As for this compilation, although you can hear Yoko on several songs - this collection tends to ignore Yoko - except where she is given production credits.  While I never cared much for Lennon's early experimental and socio-political songs, I was glad that \\"Double Fantasy\\" had six songs on this collection.  While I do think \\"Watching the Wheels\\" is probably Lennon's best song - I also got appreciations for \\"(Just Like) Starting Over\\" and \\"Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)\\".   I was even surprised to hear what sounded like a steel guitar on \\"Beautiful Boy\\".    It is a shame that Lennon did not live through the 1980s because I really think this was just the tip of the iceberg to a rejuvenated solo career for Lennon.   <br /> <br />Other very good songs outside of \\"Double Fantasy\\" that I like include \\"#9 Dream\\" and \\"Whatever Gets You Through the Night\\". <br /> <br />One thing I liked about the liner notes was that all of the lyrics for each of the songs are included.  This is something that is unusual with greatest hits collections  The songwriting credits are included as well as the song release dates and album titles the songs are from.   I would have liked to see some sort of write-up or tribute on Lennon in this collection - particularly since this was released shortly after his death.   Overall, \\"The John Lennon Collection\\" gives a good snapshot of his career.  Deep fans may want to see some more of his experimental work with Yoko. I still think the other compilations are deeper and less dated than this one, therefore I might look at those first.
0321334876|5.0|\\"Effective C++: 55 Specific Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs\\" recently came out in its 3rd edition. The first came out in 1991, making this line of book revisions positively ancient in high tech terms. But you should consider the elapsed 14 years an investment in wisdom, not obsolescence. Unlike the 2nd edition, this is a complete rewrite from the ground up. More than that, Scott Meyers begins from first principles, reevaluating what topics are most important to the programmers of 2005. <br /> <br />This was a very strategic and insightful move. Not only has the language evolved over that time, but the audience has too. In the first edition, the likely readers were coming from languages like C. Now the likely readers cross over from some other object-orient language, like Java or C#. Keep in mind  <br />that the author focuses strictly on standard C++; he does not address anything that is platform-specific.  <br /> <br />Like its predecessors, the items can be read stand-alone, and he does cross reference related items. The 55 items are grouped into the following chapters: <br /> <br />Chapter 1: Accustoming Yourself to C++ <br />Chapter 2: Constructors, Destructors, and Assignment Operators <br />Chapter 3: Resource Management <br />Chapter 4: Designs and Declarations <br />Chapter 5: Inheritance <br />Chapter 6: Implementations and Object-Oriented Design <br />Chapter 7: Templates and Generic Programming <br />Chapter 8: Customizing new and delete <br />Chapter 9: Miscellany <br /> <br />I would hate to have to learn the lessons in this book by hard experience. It would be costly in time and unfortunately might even cover more than one employment span.  <br /> <br />Most decisions that are undertaken by developers should consider ROI (return on investment), which always is measured in terms of time. For developers considering professional education material like this, the measure should be in terms of how many mistakes could be avoided before the book pays for itself. In this case, the ROI is probably less than 2 defects.  <br /> <br />If your shelfspace for C++ books has only a few slots, this book should be in your \\"must haves.\\" The book's ISBN is 0-321-33487-6 and it retails for $45 US.

Compiled mostly of Led Zeppelin's earlier hits, ranging from the thundering riffs of \\"Heartbreaker\\" to the more mellow accoustic charm of \\"Going to California\\", this three-cd set was recorded from one of the band's powerful concerts. Every song, partially improvised in a delicious fashion (a solo was added to the Immigrant Song) is beautifully performed. \\"Immigrant Song\\", \\"Heartbreaker\\", \\"Black Dog\\", and \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" are worth the price tag alone; it is most definetly rock and roll and its best, mixed with the magic and musical genious of the band's enduring legacy.

B0002IVN9W|1.0|I have absolutely no idea where the hype for this album comes from.  If all you listen to is ClearChannel radio, then I guess this album might sound like a breath of fresh air.  But if you're at all familiar with any decent indie, garage, or post-rock music, you'll immediately recognize many far more talented bands whose sound The Arcade Fire is desperately ripping off.  A lame attempt to sound like a cross of The Talking Heads, Modest Mouse, and pretty much every indie band of the 90's, this album falls absolutely flat.  I've given this album multiple listens in the hope of figuring out what the big deal is, and am giving up.  There just isn't anything there.  If you think Gwen Stefani is \\"cutting edge\\", or if you still think that \\"alternative\\" music can be played on MTV then maybe you'll enjoy listening to this music just because your 15 year old cousin doesn't listen to them yet.  Whatever, save your money.

The concept is outright amazing: John Scofield and Medeski, Martin, and Wood get together as one band!  Could it get any better?  The musical communication and interaction between these artists is masterfully done.  There is so much balance and stability between them all, along with soulfulness and professional musicianship.  Five stars.
B00005OAIE|3.0|For all that I love his smokey voice and smooth lyrics, this music is VERY 3 stars. It's very NICE, you can't really hate it but there is a certain quality missing, an element of originality or a spark of creativity that could have brought this album so much higher. It is, after all, pop and so not meant to be challenging. One reviewer said \\"clean your house to this\\" and gave 5 stars. Background music to me will never get 5 but sometimes it is exactly what you want.
B0001WTWCO|1.0|If you are a Seinfeld fan you may recall that Elaine preferred to be fired rather than watch this wretched movie. I fully understand Elaine's choice. It is not simply that this movie is slow, it is that it is bad and slow, a combination that eats at your very soul. I made it to the 55 minute mark and am still amazed that I was able to accomplish that. A large part of the problem here is that none of the characters you meet are to any degree likable. Nor are they interesting.  <br /> <br />With many movies I do not enjoy, I can nonetheless ascertain why people enjoy them. I can even understand why people like Titanic, but I have no idea why anyone likes this movie.
068987474X|5.0|THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU TO READ WHEN ALONE OR LISTEN TO IN YOUR CAR.  SOMETIMES WE NEED A LITTLE PUSH TO OPEN OUR EYES.  HEY GIRLS TAKE STOCK IN YOURSELVES AND REALIZE WE DONT NEED TO SETTLE.  \\"DONT WASTE THE PRETTY\\"  THIS IS A CUT AND DRY WAKE UP CALL.
1573223085|2.0|Like far too many books, A WHOLE NEW MIND really could have been a pamphlet. The book does contain a few good ideas, but nothing that really warrants an entire book. This is a disappointing follow-up to Dan Pink's first book, FREE AGENT NATION, which is more of an eye-opener that is worth the read.
0743454537|5.0|This may be one of the best books I have ever read.  I found myself laughing and crying, but mostly thinking.  Jodi Picoult is such an amazing writer!  Don't miss this one!
B0007O38F8|3.0|Get Rich is a really good record, but why 50 down for this album? Because so many person push him to be like, a recording selling artist, not a hard rapper anymore. Sort of like Ja Rule! In so many tracks I see that he just do a trash. Track like Piggy Bank (kindergarten sing-a-along), Intro (silly, while he shootin, he play a kids piano song), Gatman & Robbin (even you're a Batman fans, this is a really bad-a$$ song, I 100% hate iiiiiiittttttt!), Gunz Come Out (the title sounds soooooooo, BUT the song is so kiddyyyy!), This Is 50 (bad song, but why the so stupid?)is so F^^kin'!!!!!!!!  <br />The good news is you still can enjoy the beats here, especially from the singles here. <br />My favourite songs: In My Hood, I'm Supposed, Candy Shop,Just A Lil' Bit, Hate It or Love It <br />After all, I think this just a great dance album, not a hard rap! <br /> <br />P.S. maybe you heard the roumor that 50 kicked out Ja from the business. I think so. But he did it with become just like him (Ja)!
B0006L16N8|5.0|I remember how anxious I was for this album to come out, I was very worried about the idea of Coldplay's new X&Y album because I wasn't sure if it was going to trigger that heart felt emotion as A Rush of Blood to the Head. There was indeed no reason for me to worry, because the album is very 'heavy', the lyrics flow and the mystical sounds take you out of your body and lift you high into the sky, near the outter limits of time. Each song tells a very haunting story of love and sacrifice, destiny and time, space and otherworldly voices, the paino is used to enhance Chris's magical voice.  <br /> <br />I think the single 'Speed of Sound' was brilliant, although when I first heard the soaring sounds of speed of sound I thought it was Clocks. The anatomy of the album is basically made up of a detailed fabric of beauty, love, and talent.
B00005JLXE|5.0|Wow...simply wow. I had never even heard of Daredevil in my life, until the movie. I saw the commercails and thought it was just a copy of Spider-Man. How wrong I was. This is an incredible movie, with a deep story, humor, action, love, and a good comic book nerd's love of sticking to the true story of the hero. I went from hateing this movie, to loveing it. OBSESSING over it. It is my ultimate fav movie ever. ANYONE who can sit back and enjoy a movie, without picking it apart, will enjoy this. Sure it doesn't have the best effects, so what? It's not suppose to be Spider-man, it's just the story of how a man set out to save a city. It's got some memorable characters, like Bullseye, and Foggy. (Franklin Nelson) Bullseye is deliciously evil and twisted, and Foggy a wonderful comical character. And of cource the talented and beautiful Jennifer Garner playing Elektra is an intriguing character, enough to get her own Moive. (Which might I add is also amazing)It's got it's good action sequences, and tough fights. The story is stunningly true to the comic books. Alot of little details, like the way Bullseye kills, things they say are straight from the comics...pretty amazing. If your a comic book nerd, like me, you'll enjoy these aspects. And if your not, you'll enjoy the love story, and action. What-ever your tastes, just see it. Give it a chance. It's pretty dam amazing, if I do say so my self.
B000022TSH|4.0|I just now got around to seeing this great flick.  I had passed it over many times before i guess because of the misleading title and cover but after deciding to give it a watch im glad a did.  This movie is one of Jack's best and truly withstands the test of time.  I wouldnt change a single thing about it except maybe the ending.  Not that the ending was bad but i felt it was a little rushed.  The rest of the movie had GREAT pacing and then it kinda ends.  If you havent seen this one yet DONT wait any longer!
B00005JNJT|5.0|This movie showed some great things. Christian Bale is most likely the best batman to date (Keaton a close second). This movie really shows the pain of Bruce Wayne as a child and what he went through growing up. It is one of the best action movies of all time in my opinion. I would really incourage you to see this great movie.
B00097A5I6|1.0|I have to admit I love Oasis, but since Heathen Chemistry, they have hit rock bottom. This is the worst CD Oasis has made to date. It's uninspired garbage, poor vocals and standard arrangements. If this is the best they have to offer these days, they should live off the royalties from the early stuff and retire. <br /> <br />
B0009353IW|5.0|I'm just old enough to remember the Dodgers playing in L.A.'s Coliseum--and my first look at the new Dodger Stadium, shining like a giant multicolored jewel in the hillsides of Chavez Ravine.<br /><br />It's still one of the most beautiful stadiums in the world, but it was years before I learned that it rests on the site (in some cases, even on the ruins) of what was once a \\"Poor Man's Shangri-La,\\" the three Mexican-American communities of Chavez Ravine. Spanning more than a decade, it's a sad tale, one of idealism twisted by red-baiting, racism, corrupt city officials, rampant deception and the power of Big Money.<br /><br />In \\"Chavez Ravine,\\" Ry Cooder (perhaps best known for \\"Buena Vista Social Club\\") tells the story of Palo Verde, La Loma and Bishop as no one has before.  Inspired by the photos of Don Normark, Cooder reignites the soul of Chavez Ravine in a marvelous blend of musical genre, lyrics and language. You'll hear voices since stilled by the years (Lalo Guerrero and Don Tosti), lost songs rediscovered (\\"Chinito, Chinito\\"), the visit and plea of a Space Vato (\\"El U.F.O. Cayo) and the memories of a 94-year-old hero (\\"Don't Call Me Red\\").<br /><br />It's clear from Cooder's introduction in the excellent booklet that accompanies the CD that \\"Chavez Ravine\\" is not only a lament for the loss of a the Ravine's communities, but also for the urbanization of what once made Los Angeles so special. Growing up in the San Fernando Valley, I remember orange groves, unexpected old villages and semi-rural adventurelands--all now covered by big box retailers and faceless tract homes.<br /><br />Indeed, in much of the U.S. West, we have all lived the sad tale of Chavez Ravine.  The power of Cooder's \\"Chavez Ravine\\" is how it remembers, retells, celebrates and mourns what we once had in plenty and now is slipping away.
B00005LQ04|5.0|SUSPIRIA is indeed a hyper-colorful, dreamy, horror tale. The first time I saw it I was overwhelmed by it's beautiful sets, hypnotic music, and vicious assault sequences. It took several viewings for my mind to focus on the actual storyline! I love it. Suzy Banyon (Jessica Harper) arrives at a prestigious ballet school in Germany, just in time to see a former student fleeing from the place. Suzy hears a few of the girl's parting words before she disappears into the stormy night. These words return later as keys to the entire mystery that Suzy finds herself involved in. The girl ends up butchered by a figure with a big knife, that just might not be human. The victims in this movie are all people who have seen / heard too much. They are a danger to the secret within the academy. We all know it's a coven of witches, but Argento goes all out to make it as bizarre and as interesting as possible. The \\"maggot invasion\\" and \\"room of coiled wires\\" scenes are especially memorable. Joan Bennett (Dark Shadows) is cold and enigmatic as Madame Blanc. Alida Valli is supremely menacing as Miss Tanner. I got the distinct impression that she could easily have been the she-wolf of the SS in her younger days! SUSPIRIA is a movie to be seen many times. I notice something different every time I watch it. For instance, check out the killer's fingernails in the \\"open-heart surgery\\" murder near the beginning. Also, look at the \\"wine\\" Suzy dumps in the sink, it's pretty thick doncha think?? SUSPIRIA belongs in the upper level of supernatural horror films, right next to THE EXORCIST, THE OMEN, and ROSEMARY'S BABY. A masterpiece of terror and suspense...
B00005K3PZ|5.0|My first reaction to hearing this disc was \\"Someone opened the windows and let the fresh air into this symphony.\\"  Corrupt text and all, this performance is absolutely gorgeous from beginning to end.  The analogue sound is beatiful and rich, allowing us to hear every note of Bruckner's orchestration (particularly the winds, which emerge with astonishing clarity throughout the performance).  The cellos' rendition of the second theme of the first movement is particularly beautiful.  The scherzo is exciting, and the finale exultant.  No matter how many interpretations of Bruckner symphonies you own, you need to add this one to your collection (and while you're at it, add Giulini's DGG performances of the Eighth and Ninth).  You'll never hear more enjoyable Bruckner.
B00020HEL6|5.0|I took a chance on this one and it paid off.  I had never heard of Renee before, sure am thankful for Amazon's lists.  Liked the song titles on the CD so I bought it.<br /><br />This CD is packed and Renee's voice adds a sweet bluesy quality to the jazz. Loved the duets with Chris Botti and Peter Cincotti.<br /><br />I think she has more passion than Norah Jones.
0767802624|4.0|If there was ever a movie to blow the doors off of alien conspiracies in a hilarious way this is it. For no other reason than that, Men in Black is a well-deserved hit. Combine that classic sci-fi charm with a smart combination of different special effects techniques and the chemistry of actors Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith and you have a recipe for fun.  <br /> <br />Probably the most intriguing element of Men in Black for me is its classic sci-fi charm. The urban legends of the men in black surfaced around the 50's and this movie seems to tip its hat at that prospect. The aliens and gadgets all have that classic 50's sci-fi B-movie aspect in regards to their looks and names. The B-movie aspect is all the funnier when Tommy Lee and the gang interact with this strangeness as if it were an everyday thing. In addition to the classic sci-fi fun you also see some fun with the whole government conspiracy to hide the truth. I'm telling you it's great fun seeing MIB agents with their deadpan looks handle completely outrageous situations.  <br /> <br />This movie oozes style. Not only with the sci-fi space guns and tech but also the look of the MIB headquarters. It's another throwback to the 50's with some major art deco designs and black and white color schemes. It's like looking into one of those freaky classic movies. Special effects can be a mixed bag, but still fun to watch. You get some really good animatronic effects with a few aliens as well as computer animation, but I tend to give more kudos to the animatronic side of things here. While the CG stuff looks good at a distance it starts to lack on closer shots with that very noticeable shine you get from making a too glossy surface. <br /> <br />Another plus on style is the Jones/Smith interaction. It's a lot like a buddy cop film where the two partners are very different from each other. Tommy Lee's straight and serious Agent Friday style of professionalism is perfectly juxtaposed by Will's irreverent wisecrackingstyle. My favorite performance is from Vincent D'Onofrio, who made an enormously entertaining performance as the bug in an Edgar suit. I don't think you could have gotten a better cast.  <br /> <br />While Men in Black is a definite plus it does have a few limitations. For one the pacing of the movie feels rushed in a certain way, although it's hard to put my finger on. I suppose Will's indoctrination into MIB worked well, but after he became an agent, things moved more mechanically than dynamically. Might be more of a time constraint issue than anything else. Also this movie is slimy. You will find lots of gooey and icky stuff splattering all over the place. Some of you might get into it. I just feel like I need a shower.  <br /> <br />Men in Black is ultimately light entertainment that pokes fun at the genre while at the same time being true to it. The only people I can't recommend this movie to are the ones who are looking for a whole lot of depth in the story, or can't get around the slimy stuff.
B00005QATY|5.0|My boyfriend said, \\"Sit down and watch this with me\\".  I looked at the jacket: three guys from prison. Looked like a dumb guy movie.  But these escapees were funny. (And Everett wasn't any smarter than the other two, he just had a bigger vocabulary.)  I was laughing in no time, but my boyfriend was REALLY laughing. I said, \\"I know this is funny, but it's not THAT funny\\". \\"Oh yes it is, when I lived in Oklahoma, I KNEW people like this.\\"  Delmar is so sweet, he apologized for everone else's mistakes, and butterflies land on his finger.  Poor Pete, everything bad happens to him.  And Everett keeps saying that this time he really is telling the truth. I am not a fan of \\"country music\\", but I loved all the songs in this, particularly \\"Man of Constant Sorrows\\" (OMG, loved the silly dancing they did on stage at the end), and the gravediggers song, so moving.  Some of our favorite lines are: <br />\\"We're in a tight spot\\" <br />\\"What line of business are you in? Some of your folding money's come undone.\\" <br />\\"I don't want Fop, G*d-d*mm*t, I'm a Dapper-Dan man.\\" <br />\\"You watch your language young man, this is a family establishment\\".  <br />\\"Yep, they're going to kick our butts\\", \\"No I think they're going to paddle it\\" <br />\\"And stay out of the Woolsworth!\\" <br />And MY favorite: \\"Of course it's Pete, LOOK at him!\\" <br />I know these are not funny here, but they are really funny in context. <br /> <br />This is not an over the top kind of funny, like Lethal Weapon or Dumb and Dumber, it is a subtle kind of funny, like, \\"I can't believe these guys are so serious about how ridiculous they're being.\\"   <br /> <br />I also like that it has a \\"restored and colorized\\" look to it. It makes you think they are in some kind of fantasy land. And a lot of the smaller parts are played by people with very interesting faces. They are funny just to look at. <br /> <br />I like KKK Scene, it is so reminiscent of when the Scarecrow, Tinman and Lion are breaking into the Witche's Castle.And if you read the script, the KKK is signing \\"E-I-E-E-I-O, Eenie, Meenin, Miny, Mo\\".  <br /> <br />Pappy O' Daniel and his Yes Men are too funny too.  <br /> <br />I think the best part about this movie is that it all seemed so disjointed and fun, and until you got to the end, you had no idea how everything was interrelated.  It was such a fun, unpredicable surprise.  :)  <br /> <br />
B00006JDVV|4.0|This is an interesting movie. It is a very unique post apocalyptic story that seems to have a lot of potential for greatness. To be honest it didn't achieve that greatness. It seems to be missing something. While many, many elements shine the product as a whole didn't. There is nothing to really draw you into the movie. There isn't enough drama or character development to bring you in on an emotional level. There isn't enough action to make up for the lack of drama. There isn't enough exposition on the story to at draw you into the setting. What you get is a pretty good movie that doesn't really go anywhere.     The premise is actually really cool. Dragons taking over the Earth and humans now being refugees is a really cool take on the post apocalyptic genre. The sets and location shots gave a perfect view of this with charred buildings, partially melted vehicles, and ash everywhere. The dragons also look great. They did a nice design on them. The problem on this front is you only get a taste of what all the events leading up to, and including, the present. The movie doesn't focus too much on that side of the story. What's even worse is how they explain why the dragons propagated as fast as they did all over the planet. When you think about it that theory just doesn't make sense in that grand a scale. So the end result is lack of exposition.     This isn't really an action packed movie, but normally that isn't a bad thing. The problem here is what do you have to make up for it? Don't get me wrong. You get some really exciting scenes here. There is one scene with these human skydivers called Archangels that is really exciting to watch. When the humans are either fighting off the dragons or just trying to survive an attack can get cool too. Of course seeing the dragons in action will also get your blood pumping. The special effects that bring these scenes to life are spectacular. They definitely put a lot of attention on that side. The problem is these scenes are toofew to consider this movie an action flick. So now we have very little story development and not a lot of action to distract you from that.     If you don't have a strong story and you don't have a ton of explosions then you are going to have to have some strong character development and powerful scenes between them. Alas you don't get that here. The characters are essentially static. What depth the characters have ends up becoming stale since nothing is really done with it. The acting is great by the way. Matthew McCaughnahy makes a surprisingly different departure than what I am used to seeing him do. So the acting is not the problem. It's the script. It does give you a little drama, but not enough to move anywhere beyond what you already see. Doesn't leave much else, does it.    Reign of Fire is not a bad movie. It just doesn't go very far. If you must have a movie with a definite strength in any of the stuff mentioned then you might end up being disappointed. Any of you dragon fans out there would definitely not be disappointed as the concept and execution of the dragons make them way cool. If you can look past a movie being more a \\"Jack of all Trades\\" with no strength on any one aspect I think you will find yourself having a good time with this one.
B00005QENZ|4.0|THIS, BEING ONE OF THE MORE RECENT AEROSMITH ALBUMS, IS QUITE GOOD. JUST ABOUT ALL OF THE SONGS ARE GOOD. THE BEST SONGS ON THIS CD ARE ''EAT THE RICH'', THE TITLE TRACK, ''SHUT UP AND DANCE'' [WHICH IS HEARD AT THE END OF WAYNE'S WORLD 2], AND ''AMAZING''. IN MY OPINION, EVERY AEROSMITH ALBUM THAT FOLLOWED THIS ONE IS MEDIOCRE. SO, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, THIS MAY BE THE LAST GOOD AEROSMITH CD I EVER HEAR.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|This boxset is a must have for any one who has ever bought a Michael Jackson album, CD or cassette.  No matter what he has been accused of, art is art, and there is no artist with the talent he has.  No one else has the ability to reach such a diverse population of people through music.  It's amazing if you stop to think about how many people enjoy his music when they don't even know what he is singing (because they don't know English).  He is still the best of all time.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|Great album!  By the limited edition and play Disc 2 in your home theater for a geat experience, it's definately worth $24.99!
6305841861|5.0|A seminal horror film, Evil Dead 2 has set the tone for most mainstream horror films over the last 18 years.  It combines real suspense and gore with more than a dollop of schlock humor and, more importantly, a pro-active central character.  Evil Dead 2's sardonic tone and Raimi's innovative visual style echo again and again in contemporary films, traversing all genres (Scream series, Chucky, Tarantino, R. Rodriguez, etc).<br /><br />Its cartoonishness allows for tremendous amounts of gore and violence without coming off as too harsh or overwrought.  Every time a horror convention threatens us with the same old 80's fare, ED2 offers something refreshingly original.  ED 2 gives a much deserved wink to many of its stone-faced contemporaries, and it's a lot of fun.
B00097DX3U|5.0|This albums shows how Audioslave has pulled together as a tighter band.  The first album sounded exactly like a Rage/Soundgarden combination (cause that's what it was), while Out Of Exile shows that they have worked to set their differences aside and show the world a band with an independant sound.  Morello's guitar work is unbelievable to say the least, with his best performances in the first few tracks.  Cornell's inspiration from Robert Plant is obviously apparent on each and every track, and that is never a bad thing.  Wilk and Commerford set a tight rhythm section that also reminds me of Zeppelin.  The best tracks inclue Doesn't Remind Me, The Worm, Be Yourself, Yesterday to Tomorrow, and Man or Animal.    My only negative criticism: the opening riff on Your Time Has Come is the same exact riff (one step higher) from Bad Seed by Metallica.
B0009OPO0S|4.0|This CD is very different from her previous ones. I think she has gotten a lot of criticism for it, but we should appreciate that she doesn't repeat herself on every CD. It has an 80's feeling to it (for the most part). I love the lyrics (I like her better in Spanish) and her voice is stronger and better than ever. My favorite songs are La Tortura (I love A. Sanz), La Pared, and Dia de Enero. <br />
0784011680|3.0|Yes, this is without a doubt, the best biographic film made of Chaplin...also just about the only one. However, if you are looking to learn more about the man and his work, choose a well done documentary instead. While this film was mildly entertaining, it failed to capture the magic of Charlie and his character, the Tramp. The movie seems to skip through his life at lightening speed, touching only momentarily some of the greatest things that Chaplin is legend for. Most of the film was spent on Chaplin's personal life off camera and even that was only somwehat accurate. Many of the bits played by Chaplin are out of context and things hapen on screen which never happened in Charlie's real life. For instance, Chaplin supposedly sees his first \\"flicker\\" in Montana and it is at that time he supposedly gets a telegram from Mack Sennett about signing with Keystone to be in the \\"flickers.\\" While this may add drama, this never happened. To be honest, the way Chaplin describes it in his autobiography is more dramatic than the way it was depicted in this film. As is most of the material.  <br /> <br />The thing which is perhaps most disturbing is the appearance of the characters. If you're a true Chaplin fan, you'll know that Robert Downey Jr. is not able to pull of The Little Fellow all that well - in fact there are probably only a handful of actors that could. Downey is much more built, his head is too small in proportion to his body, and his face doesn't show the more gentle demeanor that Chaplin had. His voice was way too different was well. Of course, Chaplin was a silent actor, but he did make a series of sound films and unfortunately, Downey's voice sounded nothing like Chaplin, even the British accent. However, there are a few instances in which Downey did almost make me believe that it was Chaplin himself that I was watching.  <br /> <br />The supporting actors weren't all that impressive either. Sydney Chaplin looked nothing like his real life counterpart, Chaplin'smother looked like a completely different person.  <br /> <br />Chaplin's early wives are barely mentioned at all. If you haven't read his autobiography or knew about them in advance, you probably wouldn't know who they were at all. Lita Grey is hardly seen while in real life, she constituted one of the most difficult and dramatic parts of Chaplin's entire life, not to mention she gave him two children.  <br /> <br />This film can satifsy a craving for observing the personal side of Chaplin, but I'd rather snuggle up with a biography on him written by his friends and family. They reveal what really happened and a side of Charlie that you won't see anywhere else - even in the movies. I recommend \\"My Father, Charlie Chaplin\\", written by Charlie Jr.; \\"My Life With Chaplin\\", written by Lita Grey Chaplin; \\"The Charlie Chaplin Interviews\\"; and of course Chaplin's own books, \\"My Autobiography,\\" \\"Charlie Chaplin's Own Story,\\" \\"My Life in Pictures.\\"
B00008LOS1|5.0|I too wonder what is up when an album like this gets a one star review with a totally pointless text to support it. <br />This is without question one of the finest, possibly the finest album the Who produced. If you are a collector of great rock albums and do not have this album in your collection, well, allow me to point out a major gap. You will find the production and engineering on this SACD to be particularly fine. I would like to note that the SACD version of Tommy is also a must have.
0780626966|5.0|A great collection for a teenage sleepover! Guaranteed to make you scream!
B00005JNJT|5.0|I just saw this movie on opening day with my nephew and his friend..and my gosh!! I was so amazed by it. It was almost as great as the oringal Tim Burton film. And that's saying alot! Bale did a wonderful job as both Bruce Wayne and Batman...almost out doing Micheal Keaton. The acting was wonderful....every one really put everything they had into their given role. I loved the fact that we got to watch Jim Gordon as he rose through the ranks over the course of the movie.  Micheal Cain had some funny lines and all the flashbacks with young Bruce and his father really tugs hard on your heart strings! I must admit though the secnes showing people's fears after being exposed to Scarecrow's fear gas were a bit scary and could give younger viewers nightmares. Another than that I high recomend this movie to every one! Batman fans or just movie lovers GO SEE THIS MOVIE AS SOON AS POSSIABLE!!
B00005JMUA|5.0|This story has a lot of movement for one mostly set in a few desert locations. <br /> <br />If it's either two slow or too violent for some people, I found it kept a remarkable balance of narrative and action, of heart and meaning. There was Karmic symmetry in the proceedings. <br /> <br />Uma Thurman rocks... and this movie is her warrior soul.
0812968255|5.0|Marcus' notes of his mindset on a challenging life appeared (to me at least) to be far from being gloomy or defeatist...  The everyday triumphs of dealing well, gladly and constructively with that which others would whine, moan and perhaps cry about is much greater a joy than observing the regular course of nature recycling all seemingly positive things of the present into different, new things is any form of tragedy.    It is indeed, in my experience over a couple years now, like having a wise, kindly old grandfather sharing relentlessly honest, mercilessly level-headed advice on how to gladly and properly socially deal with a world otherwise often seemingly made largely of chaos.  He very clearly conveys the value of accurately, with remarkably scientific discipline, seeing the true nature of things and of concerning oneself utterly clearly and well with the present.  This burns efficiently through popular illusions of being able to persue happiness via, say, an endless stream of mere purchases and then often attempting to persue further happiness by gloating/boasting to others of those purchases et cetera or other like self-defeating acts of desperation.  The resultant peace of mind from even some success at such discipline carries its own indestructible happiness, especially in an age when one appears at least partly measured by how much time one spends gabbing into a tiny shiny thing with lots of buttons and expensive monthly charges.    There are many, many books dispensing a wise inspiration of the day and such, but it is paramount to understand the reasoning that creates those daily inspirational sayings so that those sayings do not simply become something else externally created to be regularly consumed such as are, say, milk, bagels and fruit.  Do not wonder at the possible thoughts of someone you look up to, but have such thoughts yourself as Marcus put it.  Marcus has done well in managing to pass down in a set of personal notes a taste of the disciplinethat formed classical Greek philosophy, that philosophy that formed the foundation for modern psychology and other science.    How does reading it (or having my computer read it back to me in my time-restricted case) compare with, say, listening to good music?  The thoughts expressed seem as carefully and fluently expressed as the content of most any good music, and at least as beautiful and timeless.  I have also found it to have a rather uncanny way of leading to a following day of greater real value than the preceding day, especially following a day containing difficulty in dealing with those we may otherwise consider frustating or impossible.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Who would have thought 3 years ago that Coldplay would just keep getting better? Who could have imagined after listening to AROBTTH that there was something more that we hadn't heard before? But alas, there was something brilliant hidden and waiting to surface. Coldpay's third album, X&Y, finally allows them to utilize their talent to its fullest. It provides the perfect platform for them to take their trademark sound and elaborate on it. I can't get this album out of my head. It's hard to even rate the songs individually because I think they're all 10's. Anything on the album is worthy of being called a standout. My only complaint is that the album could have ended at 12 songs. The bonus track is good, but I don't think they needed it. It's going to be very interesting to see how they follow-up X&Y. This is the first album in the past 5 years that really qualifies as being outstanding. If Coldplay ever reaches legendary status, X&Y will be one of the reasons why.
0425129616|4.0|Readers everywhere are grateful to the sister of Agatha Christie for placing a bet with her, claiming that the woman that nowadays is known as the Queen of Mystery would not be able to write a good detective story. That is actually how this novel and the character of Hercule Poirot came into existence. In this first effort we can see the basic traits that later established Christie as one of the best mystery writers ever, though some of her technique is not yet completely polished. For example we get only a brief description of each of the characters, except for Poirot, so it is hard to picture some of them clearly. Nevertheless, the story deserves high praise, and I am pretty sure Agatha won the bet!<br /><br />The story is narrated by Hasting, who gets an invitation to spend some time in the country place of John Cavendish at Styles Court. Upon his arrival, Hasting notices that there is a certain level of tension in the family, since John's mother, Emily, has recently married a younger man, who the family considers to be a fortune hunter. Meanwhile, John and his brother Lawrance are having financial trouble, and a set of interesting characters surround Emily and have all kinds of suggesting exchanges with her. When the lady of the house is murdered it comes as no surprise. There is a main suspect, but also a myriad of possible candidates for the role of the killer.<br /><br />Luckily, Hasting runs into Poirot at the time of these events, and the small man with the peculiar moustache, who has retired from the Belgian police, is more than happy to help solve the baffling case. Those that have read other novels by Christie know that the author has an outstanding ability to mislead us into believing we have discovered the culprit, only to turn the tables on us and leave us dumbstruck. This case is no different...Ahhh, those little grey cells!
B0009HLDFU|3.0|Ever since the release of \\"One by One\\" I've thought something was missing from the Foo Fighters' sound, but I couldn't put my finger on it until now.  This release marks the first time that the Foo Fighters have put out more than one album using the same lead guitarist.  While each album has been unique thanks to the changing of guitarists, through all of the turnover Dave Grohl has managed to keep the core sound of the Foo's alive.  Unfortunately, for this release they've stuck with the least talented of the four musicians who have occupied that guitarist position, Chris Shiflett (who's previous claim to fame was the unoriginal punk cover-band Me First and The Gimme Gimmes).  There are some great individual performances--particularly by Grohl and Hawkins--but in the end the sound just doesn't come together as it could have. <br /> <br />The first disc of \\"In Your Honor\\" picks up where the band left off with \\"One by One\\".  In a word: stale.  Even Grohl admits it was a less stellar record than previous efforts: \\"I was kinda pissed at myself for 'One by One'.  Four of the songs were good, and the other seven I never played again in my life,\\" Grohl said in a Rolling Stone interview.  Overall, \\"One by One\\" was comparatively uninventive and featured little variation song-to-song by Foo standards.  The sad thing is that they didn't do anything to correct this problem, and Disc 1 continues that trend.  In fact, it sounds as if it could have been recorded in the same studio sessions as \\"One by One\\". <br /> <br />It's not as though the songs on Disc 1 are bad; actually, they're still better than 90% of the rock bands out there right now.  Every song has a catchy vocal hook in the chorus and competent musicianship.  But that's the problem: every song follows the same formula and there is very little musically that sets any one song apart as unique from any other.  If you really love \\"Best of You\\" and don't mind hearing nine more songs just like it, then you're in luck.  Things start off well enough as \\"In Your Honor\\" makes a decent opening track with lots of screaming and echo distortion, but it's really just the introduction to what was supposed to be an epic album and on its own has little merit.  \\"No Way Back\\" manages to rise slightly above the crowd, and then comes the first single \\"Best of You\\".  But basically everything after that just ends up sounding like it's been done before.  It's as though the band is on auto-pilot and just churns out carbon copies of what has worked for them in the recent past.  What's worse is that any of the truly unique work has been moved to Disc 2, leaving little reason to give Disc 1 repeated listens if you already own any older Foo albums. <br /> <br />So where has the wonderful variety of music that we used to find on Foo albums gone?  Surely on Disc 2--with the promise of a different side to the Foo Fighters' sound and all of its excellent guest musicians--you would expect to find a wonderful collection of noticeably exceptional songs.  But you don't.  All of the songs are very pleasant sounding acoustic numbers, but once again every song follows the same basic progression--only this time at a much slower tempo.  In a studio full of music legends, it's as if none of them care to take the spotlight and actually play or sing anything truly worthy of remembering. For all the talent represented on the second disc, the arrangements largely allow it to go to waste.  John Paul Jones contributes a soft backing piano on \\"Miracle\\" and an all but unnoticeable mandolin on \\"Another Round\\".  On other tracks various guests produce forgettably pleasant backing music on harmonica, bass, and violin, as well. <br /> <br />It's not until the final three tracks of the album that you'll finally come across anything that won't put you to sleep.  \\"Virginia Moon\\" features Norah Jones on piano and singing backup.  With its \\"Girl from Ipanema\\" vibe, it's easily the best song of the album's second half.  Then comes \\"Cold Dayin the Sun\\" which continues to mix things up by placing drummer Taylor Hawkins at the microphone and moving Grohl back behind the drum set.  The final track \\"Razor\\" is a stripped bare number with Dave's vocal plus an unexpected acoustic guitar from Josh Homme (of Queens of the Stone Age) who is apparently able to play excellently even without heavy distortion. <br /> <br />This was supposed to be the release that made long-time fans take notice and say \\"Hey, I haven't heard that before.\\"  In press releases promoting \\"In Your Honor\\" Grohl said that he hoped this release would be the Foo's defining album, like Led Zeppelin's \\"Physical Graffiti\\" had been for them.  You can't blame him for shooting for the stars, but they seem to have fallen short of the mark.  Instead of \\"Physical Graffiti\\" we're left with something like \\"In Through the Out Door\\": an interesting experiment in mixing new and old sounds that produced a gem or two, but widely considered to be one of Zeppelin's weaker works. <br />  <br />To sum up: you can pretty much just listen to tracks 1-3 and then 18-20 and you will have heard everything the Foo's have to offer here.  The band could have done well for themselves by eliminating the double album and concentrating on using the material they had to make 11 or 12 great songs instead of 20 mediocre ones.  I'm giving \\"In Your Honor\\" 3 stars because even though they've done it before and much better on previous albums, at least it still sounds like the Foo Fighters.  Obviously a band's sound will evolve and change over time, but in this case you can't really call it forward progress.  The Foo's greatest album to date remains \\"The Colour and the Shape\\" with minor legend Pat Smear on guitar.  Not coincidentally, that was also the last Foo album that Grohl did the drum work for.  If Grohl wants to talk about a career defining release then he should bundle that album with Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\".  Now that Chris Shiflett appears to be here to stay, it looks like all of Dave Grohl's best work may be behind him. <br /> <br />(And for those of you keeping score at home, I only mentioned 2 of the 4 lead guitarists.  The other two are Franz Stahl, who helped write but did not appear on \\"There is Nothing Left to Lose\\"; and of course Dave Grohl, himself, who played virtually every instrument on the self-titled debut.)
B000002UTT|4.0|Roxette made a phenomenal first album in Look Sharp!  They made smartly produced pop in this effort, which launched hits with The Look, Dangerous, and the dramatic power ballad Listen To Your Heart. The songs have loads of catchy pop hooks and adventurous landscapes very common with '80s music. Listen sounds dramatic in its 5-minute version versus the single version cut for the radio. Marie Fredrikkson looked a little bit like Madonna of her 1986 True Blue album period, but she had a style of her very own. Her male partner had a unique sexiness to his voice to blend with hers. Male-female pop duos were missing for a decade since the Sonny and Cher, Captain and Tenille and Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis Jr. era of the '70s. But it took until 1989 for this to come back, and Roxette made a superb debut album. Their album's lyrics can be a little cliched, but there's a warmth within them in this duo. This album's songs are still played today, and Look Sharp is still a pop classic.
B0009PVZWI|5.0|\\"In 20 years when some kid goes to their dad and askes him if he owns any Foo Fighters, I want the album that kid asks for to be 'In Your Honor'\\" is what Dave Grohl says on the DVD side of this double DualDisc album. And it is a good album, no doubt. The Foo Fighters modeled this album after Led Zepplin's \\"Physical Graffitti\\". What kid asks for \\"Physical Graffitti\\" over \\"Zepplin IV\\"? Well, maybe....but anyways I would be more likely to give that kid \\"The Colour And The Shape\\". The album is as stated so many times before half electric and half acoustic. It's pretty solid throughout.<br /><br />The other features you get with the delux DualDisc is a semi-complicated packaging, that looks cool, \\"enhanced stereo\\" of both parts of the album, the documentary DVD video and the acoustic album in 5.1 Surround Sound. For what you get it's not the worst price I've ever seen. Plus an unstated extra feature is that there's no \\"Copy Protection\\" on the DualDisc.<br /><br />The music is the best feature though. Each album works well on its own and could mix up well with the other disc at the same time. It's nothing totally unlike the Foo Fighters have ever done, it's just more of it. The Foos have always made great albums and this is another one.
B00009V8Z9|1.0|Honest to god i hate this cd with allmy pasion but the stripped version of this cd it is beauutiful. STRIPPED makes gavin sound so real live and personal. while the studio version lacks the grit and grime of gavin's beautiful smooth and sometimes scratched vocals  <br /> <br />BUY CHARIOT STRIPPED INSTED THAT WAY YOU HABVE THE CHOICE TO LISTEN TO TH STUDIO VERSION AND THE STRIPPED VERSION TOGETHER!!!
B0009A1AS2|3.0|I admit to be a DT fanatic, but this album dissapoints me.  The album reminds me of heavy metal, but nothing else.  The 8th song, Octavarium is prog'ish, but still, I'm not remembering anything from this album, and I have every single drum beat memorized from every song since their first album.  The drums are very blah, I'm disspaointed with Mike's creativity here.  The music in general should have been 3 times more complicated like all their other albums are.  Everything was practically in 4/4, what's up with that?  Straight forward playing from Dream Theater?  If I had wanted to listen to that I would have bought some new Metalica or Rush. <br />But only one band could make such regular metal sound this good.  I'm impressed with the keyboard/guitar riffs, second to none for sure.  And James vocals are out of this world on the last track, outstanding screaming one second, back to sweetness the next second. <br />I wish (like I wish Rush would make a 12 minute epic) that Dream Theater would go back to IAW or SFAM and just make the album of a lifetime, but this is unfortunately just a simple album filling in the gaps of their maturity before that next amazing all conqureing album comes out again.
0345409671|3.0|\\"Memnoch the Devil\\" is the fifth novel in the non-horror series \\"The Vampire Chronicles\\" describing a specific encounter with another individual of extraordinary powers.  Lestat recounts an entire account with splendid descriptions of the characters and the environments, on par with all the other narratives.<br /><br />Aside from the lovely language, the plot turns ghastly when the consummately immature vampire receives another outrageous offer from a new creature calling itself Memnoch.  Hoping the foolish Lestat has learned from past mistakes, one is left questioning throughout why Lestat of all individuals encounters these alleged religious experiences ranging from Creation to the Passion to visiting Heaven and Hell that consumes most of the book.  I wonder if a setting outside Lestat would have elicited a greater tale, in other words create a world of characters not using the vampiric vehicle.  Some might be outraged by the implications of a vampire drinking the blood from Christ and his fixation with consuming the female menstruation.<br /><br />[minor spoiler]<br /><br />Allowing Lestat to consume the blood of Christ is either a poor plea by God or a devious lie by Memnoch.  Given the unsaid ramifications it might have on the demon presence residing in the vampire blood if it were truly the blood I believe the incident was a lie.  Otherwise I would have expected him to burst into flames or totally transform psychologically, not have an equal ecstatic experience as normal human consumption and not change dramatically.<br /><br />[end minor spoiler]<br /><br />The ending reveals amazing discoveries and surprises for the mortal and immortal world due to Lestat's naïve nature.  During the story all of the individuals gush an inordinate amount of love and fondness at every person and everything almost to the point of sickening.  Dora's has an unreal affection for Lestat, allowing intolerable and disgusting behavior to exist in her presence.  Overall I found too many holes in the explanations and not enough wisdom from the childish Lestat.  He was such an engaging and powerful figure in the first couple volumes and has now become a mockery of vampire omniscience.<br /><br />The author forgoes some of the traditional limitations found in the vampire genre such as the crucifix, holy water, and garlic, creating her own world where images on reflective surfaces are allowed.  The outrageously powerful vampires have telepathy and the eldest can perform telekinesis and spontaneous combustion on the younger vampires, abilities I've not encountered in other works.  I believe having certain restrictions on the undead brings some balance to the victims yet the novel isn't as much about the conflict between vampires and humans as it is about internal turmoil.<br /><br />Thank you.ugh wisdom from the childish Lestat.

B0006L16N8|5.0|I have been a fan of Coldplay since the beginning. They're truly a very, very special band and deserve every ounce of success they've ever received. When I first heard \\"Yellow\\"... man. That song FLOORED me. It's still one of the greatest songs ever written, melodically, especially.. and lyrically.<br /><br />This new album blows me away. ESPECIALLY Track 4, \\"Fix You\\"... if this song is not THE EPITOME of a perfect song, I don't know what is. The breakdown at around 2:40... the harmonized vocals at 3 and a half minutes.... and the LYRICS. The MELODIES.<br /><br />I started crying when I first heard \\"Fix You.\\" Songs, as much as they mean to me... don't make me cry... but this one definitely did. It blew me away. Absolutely blew me away.<br /><br />The album as a whole is an amazing, complex piece of work. I always favored Parachutes over Rush Of Blood... but.... I don't know, X&Y seems to take the top spot over Parachutes.<br /><br />This album has so many vibes... you can tell Chris Martin and company were listening to a lot of 80s music.. as a lot of the tracks have a new wave feel (because of the synthesizers) and just, the overall production and guitar riffs.. VERY 80s modern rock/new wave... that's a high compliment as some of the best music ever was released in the 80s.<br /><br />I hear U2, The Pixies, Stevie Wonder... and of course, Coldplay... everywhere on this album. It's just perfection. It's new, it's retro, it's 80s and 2005 all rolled into one. It's  absolute perfection.<br /><br />HIGHLY recommended.<br /><br />-Chris
B000003S5H|5.0|This album is great. Moon Safari manages to appeal to many different emotional states of being for me, while maintaining a cool, fresh, ubiquitous aura of calmness. Air melds several different musical \\"styles\\" extremely well together, such that, it's difficult to truly finger what really is the preeminent musical style on this album.<br /><br />Every track has something unique and great to offer. Most all listeners with an open mind will find this album laudable.<br /><br />Highlights: \\"Kelly Watch the Stars,\\" \\"Sexy Boy,\\" \\"Voyage de Penelope\\"
B00063MBU8|5.0|Perhaps, maybe, I give this album 4.5. but despite the indecision of half a star, this album is great!!!!! I've been a Simple Plan fan for ages now, I don't go around broadcasting it, as I know that there are alot of simple plan haters out there *grrrrr to you* but I'm here to tell you what I think of their latest album, which people obvioulsy think is an improvement if anything. When I wrote reviews under the name of paparoachfan04, I wrote a review on Simple Plans first album, No pads, no helmets, just balls which I gave 4 out of 4 stars, because I thought it was a great album, and I still do. So what if it's not real punk, it is just pop/punk, perhaps even emo, but Simple Plan are a kick ass band, and on this album, it's evident that they have matured, not just through their music, but through their lyrics as well. <br /> <br />If you read the lyrics to \\"Untitled\\", it's obvious that Pierre has been going through some changes, and they're good changes. In my opinion, this album is just as good as the first if not better!! <br /> <br />Also, I'd just like to clarify to all the dullards that think that the only people that like Simple Plan are whiney teenagers that go to high school that moan about splitting up with their girlfriends/boyfriends, or having a bad relationship with their parents etc, this is just annoyingly wrong. It's such a misconception, some people in their reviews have even moaned about SImple Plan being immature etc, but it's not true, they like to have a laugh, but doesn't everyone? <br /> <br />Also, perhaps in their first album, they were a little whiney, but the good thing was, that, they actually sung from a teenagers perspective, which I think can help listeners to relate to the music. So, to everyone who think Simple Plan are just another one of those crappy emo/pop-punk bands, think again. Simple Plan kick ass, and hopefully they're here to stay. <br /> <br />P.s. I saw them in concert in Manchester whilst they were promoting songs from their new album, it was amazing! They also played some classics, i.e. I'd do anything, I'm just a kid.  <br /> <br />Listen to this album, and already simple plan lovers, you won't be disappointed!
B000957O7S|2.0|Now and then movies with big name stars and expensive production budgets and PR hype that convince audiences that the Rapture is at hand hit the mat with a thud - and this HITCH is floored in the first half hour (of an overly long two hour movie!).  Using a script that uses every clich&eacute; from the myriad other films that tell this same story gimmick using females in the Smith role of date doctor, this movie limps along with silly dialogue and pratfall type of comedy, all of which could be forgiven if there was a magical chemistry between the two top stars to make it click.<br /><br />For all the talent Will Smith has demonstrated in the past (despite his recent over the top laffapaloozas like 'I, Robot', 'Men in Black I & II', 'Bad Boys I & II') such as 'Ali', 'Six Degrees of Separation', 'The Legend of Bagger Vance', he seems bent on accepting roles that are beneath him. In this bit of fluff he wastes time talking directly to the audience about the fine art of capturing a girl and then demonstrates his techniques ad infinitum on some blundering characters, ultimately  trying to apply his own wisdom in courting Eva Mendes. At this point there should be romantic magic to make this dud work, but the chemistry between the two is so polar that we are forced to wait out a dating game that is less interesting than a Home Depot commercial.<br /><br />The direction is sluggish when it begs to be slick and the acting is rudimentary at best.  NOT for fans of the gifts of Will Smith, but if you're in need of a popcorn summer flick to fan away the heat, you might try this lump of ice.  Grady Harp, June 05
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|I got this album quite a while back. But now I have the chance to write a review about it. I just want to let everyone know, that this album is an amazing album. I must admitt, when I first listened to, I was abit taken back by the style of the music, because before I bought the album, the only song I'd heard was Weak and Powerless, and Pet which to be fair, cast the impression that the music was quite....lively, upbeat, if they're the words to use, and as I have discovered, I know that A perfect circle aren't a heavy band, and I dont't think they're trying to be, but if there was a heaviest song on the album, I would say it is either Pet, or The outsider, which are both excellent songs.     I think the lyrics on this album are so clever and well put together!! The music is amazing, it's really interesting, as it's different to the style of music that I usually listen to, as compared to the likes of Papa Roach, Avenged Sevenfold, Sugarcult, Evanescence, Lacuna Coil etc this is definately different, which I think makes it unique. I've never heard anything like this before, I know that in the past APC have been compared to NIN, but I think that A perfect cirlce are better, and I prefer their music.    Also, Maynard, the lead singer, he has a fantastic voice, which I think can be really heard well on Vanishing, The Outsider, Pet and The Package.     To conclude, this album is one of a kind, and A perfect circle are very different, but very cool. As I previously mentioned, I wouldn't have usually liked any music like this, but as this album is so well put together, it's so unique, of course I like it. I think it's difficult not to recognize talent on this album. APC RULE!!

B00005JNJT|5.0|Bale has always been one of my faviorte actors ever since American Psycho. He always seems to never get any credit for his performances, and in this movie he shines. The movie is dark, action is heavy in places, but the writing was blah. The movie had a few flaws, but I still enjoyed the movie. People who dont like the movie are either iggorant people who write reviews to piss people off or they didnt like it because it didnt have enough action or have a short attention span and cant pay attention. First off, the acting was excellent, the action was great, and the movie didnt have a cheese factor like the other four movies do. I hope the trend of Batman movies are like this, and do not have Bale turning into a cheesy George Clooney type Batman.
0385483821|4.0|A book which has been conceptualized well and organized well.  The author brought up some good experiences to justify his points.  The experiences are a well mix of good and bad.  It has been very well described on how one can steer clear even when there is enough obstruction.  Particularly, the chapters where he described how Intel has evolved to a microprocessor company from a memory company; how the RISC/CISC confusion resolved; are superb.  The author also nicely explained his inidividual take on how to intercept the right message from the noise.<br /><br />Guess the term I coined from this book?  It's \\"Strategic Reflection Point\\".  It would be good for a while to use this (or may be a cozy one - SRP) to show off a know-it-all face till people start rubbishing it.  It's certainly a good book, a thought provoking one, but comes handy for use only when you are a Chief --something-- Officer.  Till then, read it to get a ring-side view.
B0006L16N8|4.0|First of all, Coldplay is one of those bands whose albums you have to listen to a few times to like them.  Anyway, after releasing their excellent last album \\"A Rush of Blood To The Head\\", they come out 3 years later with their new album \\"X&Y\\".  It is a beautifully mastered album with lovely melodies, stirring lyrics, and the great voice of lead singer Chris Martin.  Definitely listen to the song \\"Speed of Sound\\".  A wonderful CD to listen to whenever you feel lonely.  Highly recommened and much better than the disappointing new White Stripes album.
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|this album is a classic. the songs are moving and you can feel the soul in ray's voice. i love the fact that each song has a guest apperance from a notable artist. with respect to ray charles i believe that this is one of his better albums. my favorite songs are number seven with willie nelson and number six with bonnie raitt. this is def. a collectors piece for all ray charles fans, young and old.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|Maybe one of the most mature and serious features Disney has developed. It's about battles against the will and the courage of a young woman who won't give up. It's Mulan, a movie that combining very elements -humor, love and hate-, creates an intelligent story that no one should miss.<br /><br />Based on a Chinese legend, Mulan is the tale of a young girl that doesn't fit in the rigid structures imposed for her traditional culture, as to how it should be the women's' rol in society An independent spirit sentenced to \\"never bring honor to her family\\" for adopting her own way of thinking and acting.<br /><br />In the time of Chinese feudalism, the Emperor, who has to confront an attack of Huns, commanded for the evil Shan Yu, orders to recruit a man for every family to take a place n the future war. Mulan's father, the only man in her family and very tied to traditions, accepts his duty without a doubt.<br /><br />And like her father, without too much thinking, Mulan decides to takes his place, turning herself into a man. She cuts her hair, steals her dad's war weapons and gets enlisted in the military calling herself \\"Ping\\". On the road she meets 2 cartoonish-y friends, a funny dragon called Mushu and a cricket called, Crikee (convenient). Both give the usual touch of comedy in this kind of movie.<br /><br />In military life, Mulan shows a defying and rigorous training, under the critic eye of her boss, Captain Shang. And she proves both intelligence and courage in the battlefield. Her search to defend her family name and to get approval of her way of thinking is told with great style.<br /><br />The animation is very nice, from scenes as impressive as the battle in the snow to the parade before the Imperial palace. Unusual camera angles are implemented, colors and textures are used with great delicacy, enriching the cinematography; the score is light and fresh.<br /><br />In Mulan, once again Disney tries to explore emotions and feelings like family love, duty, courage, honor, obedience, boldness, willpower and team work. All of them very positive notions for children and adults, to learn and practice.ve, duty, courage, honor, obedience, boldness, willpower and team work.

B000009RC2|5.0|This is Mahavishnu Orch.'s first and best album. When I first heard it (15yrs old and played guitar in a funk band) I was stunned by the music. It is a work of genius. Everyone should own this record.
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|Of the four Queens of the Stone Age albums this one I personally feel is their best overall.  Their debut is rougher, R was more fun, Songs for the Deaf was most accessible but this album is a step beyond all of that.  When Nick Oliveri left/got kicked out of the band and Mark Lanegan went his own way, Josh Homme decided to go back to his roots a bit.  He was able to mesh the heavy groove rock of his past with his ever-developing atmospheric melodies to create 'Lullabies'.  It is dark, spacy, fun and strange all at the same time.  And most importantly it rocks!  There is really something on this album for everyone. Every song is good with the truly stand out tracks being 'Tangled Up In Plaid', 'Burn the Witch', 'In my Head', 'Little Sister', 'I Never Came' and the amazing finale 'Long Slow Goodbye' which has quickly become one of my favorite Queens songs to date.  If you like Queens of the Stone Age's other albums then definatly check this one out, you won't be disappointed.
B00005JXY3|4.0|This is in response to the review posted by Leonard Snerdly:<br /><br />The following is from \\"The Billboard Book Of Number One Hits\\" which gives an in depth look at each number one song from 1955 thru 2003. It's a great resource tool containing interviews with the songwriters and artists and much more. The story of \\"The Glory Of Love\\" is on page 643. Here's an excerpt from it:<br /><br />\\"I didn't quit\\", Cetera told Dick Clark on \\"Countdown America\\". \\"I was given my walking papers by the group. In effect, they fired me. I tried to leave when we were in our down period, right around Chicago 15\\".<br /><br />But the band's (Chicago) fortunes took an upswing in 1982, and there was touring to be done. \\"When it came time for me to do my solo album (Solitude/Solitaire) they wanted to tour some more and do the next album,\\" Cetera told Clark. \\"They said, 'You have to go on the road and if you don't...we're going to have to get somebody else'. I couldn't believe that. I think it was a management decision to 'let's scare the the living be-jesus out of Peter Cetera because we all know he would never take the step'. And it was exactly the out I was looking for. Had the guys not made that move I probably would've still been in the group\\"<br /><br />So for Mr. Snerdly to call Cetera a \\"traitor\\" is nonsense. End of story.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Just saw Batman Begins and I have to say it was better than the 1989 Keaton Batman with the Joker.  It has much more respect for the material.  I only hope that the film makers can sustain this pace for the next film.  For the first time a I actually believed that we were watching the real Batman for once. Michael Cane was exceptional as Alfred and Morgan Freeman was one of the  best choices for Batman's Q, as I call him. Q in the Bond movies created all the devices Bond utilizes in his missions. Liam Neeson was terrific as Ras Au Gul (if I spelled it correctly) there was at no time any credibility issues with the film. It was a winner from start to finish.
0451529308|5.0|If I could give it 10 stars, I would.  As someone who never had a sister, I closed this book wishing dearly that I had.  Following the trials of the four March sisters was something that I didn't want to stop when the book ended.  It was overall, a book of good will and good nature, full of people who are struggling to find themselves and ending up in places they never quite suspected by the end. But what I found most astonishing about Alcott's characters was how I found a little bit of myself in each one.   <br /> <br />What I found most fascinating was the culture of the mid-1800s- learning what was proper and not proper, and being astonished at just how much women's roles have changed since then.  <br /> <br />The book is a very quick and easy read, perfect for young people and adults alike.  I was literally absorbed into this story, much like I was with the movie version starring Winona Ryder that was so perfectly cast and faithful to the book, I should hope that all filmmakers are as kind to the literature on which they are based. <br /> <br />I highly, HIGHLY recommend Little Women!
B00005JNJT|5.0|Oh good lord, it's about time a good Batman movie came out. I think it's safe to that 99.9 percent of the population was disappointed and offended by the proverbial turd that was \\"Batman & Robin\\" (released in 1997, it was the last time the Caped Crusader had graced the silver screen). Thankfully, \\"Batman Begins,\\" making good on it's name, has no connections to the other four films Warner Bros. put out (you know, other than the fact that they are \\"Batman\\" movies). This new film is an attempt at jump-starting and revitalizing a franchise that really needs it. What better time to bring the Bat back? Comic-book movies are enormously successful these days (unless you consider \\"Elektra\\") and fans have been screaming for years for a new film to be made. One that makes up for the bad time we all had in 1997. One that makes us all appreciate Batman again, and doesn't make us feel ashamed to be fans.<br /><br />Director Christopher Nolan (\\"Insomnia,\\" \\"Memento\\") steps up to the plate, leading an outstanding cast which includes Christian Bale as the big-earred superhero in question, and recent tabloid queen Katie Holmes as his childhood friend/love interest. Nolan knows style. If you've ever seen one of his films, you know why he was the obvious choice for this project. True, he's not very well-versed in action flicks, but his dark vision is perfect for Batman. Needless to say, he succeeds in making this the best Batman movie to date. Yep, I said it. Even better than Tim Burton's \\"Batman\\" and \\"Batman Returns.\\" I love those films to death (heck, even \\"Batman Forever\\" was pretty decent), they are an important part of my childhood, but Nolan's Batman goes places Burton never bothered. Here, we are treated to the true origins of Bruce Wayne, the man, and how he came to be Batman. We get connected to him, and we feel for him, which is something I never quite felt in the other flicks. Half the movie is spent building up this enormous, complex character. True, it can wear down on you a bit if you're just in it for some heavy action scenes, or if you have a short attention span and just wanna watch an action figure commercial, but \\"Batman Begins\\" is better than that. Did I mention how good Christian Bale (who you may remember chasing a hooker with a chainsaw, wearing nothing but sneakers in \\"American Psycho\\") is as Batman? He's great. Cillian Murphy (\\"28 Days Later\\") as The Scarecrow? Brilliant. I really can't picture anyone else in that role. Michael Caine definitely delivers as Alfred, as does Morgan Freeman as Lucuis Fox (but they're always great). Heck, even Katie Holmes manages to break free from her teenage fame, turning in a performance that is only topped by her topless performance in Sam Raimi's \\"The Gift.\\"<br /><br />Everything about this movie is just incredible. I thought we were treated when \\"Star Wars\\" went out with a fight last month, and now Batman finally gets his respect with \\"Batman Begins.\\" How perfect. If you're a bat-fan, you'd be hard pressed not to like this movie. It is very well made and very respectful to the source material. Yeah, it's a little long, but so was \\"Batman & Robin,\\" and I know you watched that at least once. So why not give this one a chance? It's actually worth the time you invest in it.a bit if you're just in it for some heavy action scenes, or if you have a short attention span and just wanna watch an action figure commercial, but \\"Batman Begins\\" is better than that.

0671828150|4.0|This is the third Jane Marple book, but the first that I've read.  I read this edition (Pocket book, 1970), and I was attracted to the initial romanticism of a dead body in a private library.  Libraries are dark and notoriously eerie.<br /><br />The book starts off hilariously, but quickly becomes an interesting investigation that shakes up a bourgeoise English town.  I was suprised at how quiet Miss Marple is, and how much she sort of disappears into the background.  It isn't until the end that she even begins raising her voice to get some answers.<br /><br />The investigation itself is nothing new.  People are questioned and the reader is led to believe the facts fit together.  Miss Marple, of course, provides the fresh insight that ultimately twists everything around.  \\"Why didn't I think of that?\\" becomes the embarrassing thought in every policeman's -- and reader's -- minds.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this being the third Christie book I've read, I didn't get that thrilling feeling of following a murder case in an exotic locale.  For this, I recommend And Then There Were None, or Murder on the Orient Express.  Also, I've come to realize that, as a reader, I prefer multiple murders, serial killings, and inevitable doom.  In The Body in the Library, we have nearly three murders, but I wanted more!<br /><br />The book itself is an extremely easy and quick read, making for a great summer/travel read.  My dictionary dash included meretricious (89) and prevaricate (133).
B000026OHN|5.0|A modern and rather interesting version of the Well-tempered Clavier. Modern and interesting in the sense that sometimes he could be rather fast (though never as fast as Gould), sometimes rather loud or else rather slow and soft. Yet his approach is not altogether romantic, for he is clear and consummate, necessarily bringing us 2 or 3 hundred years back into a serene little empty chapel.     He has made use of almost all the techniques available, modern or classical to let the message come through. And as a result, we have strong individual character for each of the pieces, and there are jems everywhere. And even they are not, they are interesting enough in one way or the other.     On the other hand, to some ears, there might well be some overstatements. i.e. real fast, or too exciting which is against Bach's style. Some may also say, Richter was more inspired in some pieces than the others; and even though not as eccentric as Gould, there is the feeling that Richter has sometimes turned the pieces into a repertoire that is more intended for public performance than for recreation, and sometimes or both-- needless to say, very instructive either way. Yet, at other times, he could be as soulful as Horsworski. There are also moments when he takes us right into the heart of music like Lipatti-- as opposed to Hewitt who just keeps reminding us that it is Barogue music by its form and her peculiar tone.     However, don't expect them to be as magnetizing as the Bach in Richter's \\"Out of His Later Years\\". And be assured that is almost none of the oppression we get from him, i.e. as though the whole piece is just one phrase sort of thing. And the recording is not bad at all.     It is just preposterous that there is so little mention about Richter's Well-tempered Clavier despite the wonders we find in this performance, and the fact that he owns loads of admirers! For those who don't lend their ears to this album, they just don't know how much inspirations and insights they have missed.
0811729117|5.0|Excellent book on how Tigers were effectively deployed into combat on the Russian front by the German tank commanders.  This book, like many others, show how much independence low ranking German officers had in the field. In preperation for combat and during combat Carius took initiative that clearly shows a German officer did not have to wait for approval from a higher ranking officer.  As a contrast look at the US military actions as seen in the book 'Black Hawk Down' - in the middle of combat a driver of a Hummer could not turn left or right as directed by the observation helicopter above, until they got approval from HQ back at base.  While reading this book pay attention how much independence Carius had as a tank commander - by late 1944 he was just a First lietenant. Consider how even the lowest ranking German officers could make unilateral decisions, and you will understand why the German army remained effective despite being vastly ournumbered in airplanes, tanks, soldiers, and supplies. <br /> <br />Very interesting accounts on the mechanical problems of the Tiger - if they drove 50km with 6 tigers only 3 make it.  At the end of the book there is an extensive field report reprinted detailing very specifically items on the Tiger that need to be redesigned.
B00082IJ08|5.0|For me, this cd was a letdown waiting to happen.  The original Gorillaz cd, while not a 100% great, had 3 or 4 songs that were so good it made the entire cd seem good.  With Gorillaz producer Nakamura gone, and DJ Danger Mouse in, Demon Days provides a cd with much more consistancy.  A few tracks easily stand out as winners with just a listen (Feel Good Inc., Every Planet We Come to is Dead, and November Has Come), while others may take some time to get into (mainly the last three tracks of the cd, Fire Coming Out of the Monkey's Head, Don't Get Lost in Heaven, and Demon Days).  Dennis Hopper provides a narration to the Fire Coming Out of the Monkey's Head that creates one of the most crazy songs in years.  Feel Good Inc. as the first single provide instant comparisons to Clint Eastwood, but unfortunately, can't match that song's greatness.  However, unlike the first cd's numerous bombs (such as Gravity, M1A1, Punk, Clapper, 5/4... basically everything but Clint Eastwood, Latin Simone, Tomorrow Comes Today and depending on one's mood, 19-2000, Slow Country or Starshine).  The only real bomb on this cd is White Light.  A surprise song is DARE, a catchy song which Gwen Stefani wishes she could make... or at least have made for her to sing.  With this side-group, Damon Alburn continues to attempt any pop labels he might have gotten with early Blur albums.  Though his constant changing of styles may anger some guitarists, he proves to be a man with great musical talents.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|This is an incredible achievement by a great band! The onslaught of  guitar, drums, bass and vocals are all fantastic, and every song is one you'll listen to again and again. Unlike City Of Evil(2005) vocalist m.shadows sings more to the tune of metalcore, and not that of punk. Anyone who wants an incredible album that will stay at the top of their list of favourites should buy this album, and its a great example of modern heavy metalcore.
0596000480|5.0|I have been using David Flanagan's \\"Javascript: The Definitive Guide\\" since the 1st edition came out in 1996 and I have nothing but praise for this book, a perfect example of what makes O'Reilly books O'REILLY BOOKS.  With every new edition, David Flanagan has added new material related to the newest incarnation of Javascript (the latest being 1.5) and he provides a solid introduction of what Javascript is, the history of the language, and the basics.  From explaining how control structures are used and the data types provided with Javascript, the Author goes on to talk about the DOM, form and event processing, DHTML, cookies, etc.  After spending 400 pages on the basics of the language, another 300+ pages provide a reference to all the different functions and interfaces the language provides.  The last 300+ pages would have been handy enough to have, so I consider the first 400 pages a bonus for the price of this book.<br /><br />For anyone that is new to Javascript I think that you would find this to be an outstanding reference and a great learning material.  For experienced Javascript programmers I think this is an excellent 'refresher' guide that any programmer would benefit from reading again and again.  O'Reilly books are meant to not be flashy colors and pictures, just solid resource materials from fantastic authors and this is exactly what \\"Javascript: The Definitive Guide\\" is.  I highly recommend that any web developer put this text on your shelf, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B0006L16N8|5.0|I heard this album on the radio for the first time a few days ago and, despite having barely bought a CD for quite a few years now, was so impressed with what I heard that I went out and bought it two days later. After listening to it once I was addicted and can't stop playing it. The melodies are beautiful and it the whole album has that characteristic Coldplay ring to it. Very highly recommend this album.
0743454529|5.0|This book is one of the best books I have ever read.  Jodi Picoult's writing is compelling and emotionally charged.  I cried and cried as I read...not something I usually do.  I definately recommend this book and all of her other books as well.
B0009I7NNA|3.0|about this band and their MAJOR label debut. Well....boy! Kinda just another emo-screamo black pants, black hair band that can't scream anymore. The singer sounds EXACTLY like John Corabi (Motley Crue anyone, great album BTW) The musicianship is amazing. Chugging guitars, great drummer, excellent production (Mudrock). Songwriting isn't that great and the singer sounds like he struggles (even in the studio). Not a horrible album, but not a fraction of the hype this band carries.
0312323859|5.0|I can't believe this author was able to make me root for selfish Darcy Rhone.  Low and behold, she did!  Like most reviewers, I believe this book is better than Something Borrowed.   <br /> <br />I am hoping her next book is Something old, promptly followed by Something New!
0671027344|5.0|I first read this book when I was in eighth grade and this was before it gained such popularity and a cult following. I remember reading it and feeling like I was being let in on a secret that no one else knew about. Even though many people have read the book since I first read it, I can still read it and think that I'm being let in on a secret that no one else knows about. This is an honest portrayal of a high school freshmen who is wise beyond his years. He might have had a rough past but that doesn't necessarily matter. What really matters is the now. I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever felt like a wallflower growing up. A little strange or different. Someone who just wants to tell their story. This book has had a deep impact on my life and now that I'm a senior in high school, I still turn to this book when I need to find an answer. This book taught me what it was like to feel infinite.<br /><br />\\"And in that moment, I swear we were infinite.\\"
B0009A1AS2|2.0|That's how boring and bland this album is.  This album makes Train Of Thought sound great. <br /> <br />Why?  The melodies are mostly boring and bland.  That's it.  It's a boring, monotonous album. <br /> <br />Root Of All Evil - Boring bland, the vocals GO NO WHERE.  And what the heck?  Why peg in songs from the past?  LOLOL, wtf?  Yes Mike, we know, alcohol is bad.  And so are your dumb lyrics.  I'm going to have a beer. <br /> <br />The Answer Lies Within - Decent song actually, but mostly boring.  The lyrics are dumb, I wasn't inspired one bit.  I did like the middle bit.  It sounds kind of like an ELO sting, which is undeniable. <br /> <br />These Walls - yawwwwwwwwwwn, vocals go on a straight line, yawwwwnnnnnnnnn <br /> <br />I Walk Beside You - Straight forward pop, yes sounds like U2, but at least on this song James LaBries vocals ACTUALLY GO SOMEWHERE INTERESTING.  Most melodic song on the album. <br /> <br />Panic Attack - Sure it rocks the house down, kind of, but it's again sooo boring.  The vocals suck.  It's boring boring boring.  Whoopdee doo to this one.  But the end has a little bit of singing that is decent. <br /> <br />Never Enough - Good chorus, that's it.  The rest sucks.  I wish they would stop distorting LaBries voice.  I know he sucks live and everything, but what the heck? <br /> <br />Sacrificed Sons - Oh for the love of god give me a break.  Not only is it boring as heck, but LaBrie should never be allowed to write vocals. <br /> <br />Here, I can write vocals like James LaBrie: <br />--------------------- <br />Misunderstood <br />Uncompromised <br />All is good <br />My blind eyes <br /> <br />See?  He writes stupid 1-3 word lines that under his delusion makes him seem simple yet very intelligent.  LZOLZ, if you think I'm dumb, just look at the \\"song\\" Vacant on Train Of Thought.  EZ PZ.  Don't write lyrics LaBrie.....or Portney.....or Petrucci.......hmmmm ....where's Kevin Moore when you need him. <br /> <br />Octavarium - Crap, 23 minutes of boredom.  Nuff said. <br /> <br />I'll stick to Images and Words
630463949X|5.0|Duel sided DVD, Side A - 5.1 dolby digital and Side B - lpcm stereo ...PLAY SIDE A for best sound <br /> <br />Bad point; <br />Christine smile, it's all good <br />Unlike \\"The Dance\\" on CD, \\"Sara,\\" is not found on the DVD. <br />In \\"Landslide\\" Buckinghams finger tip bump his accoustic guitar, on my 7.1 system it makes a thump, thump, thump sound as he plays that drives me nuts. <br /> <br />GOOD point; <br />Again in The Dance, Stevie Nicks and Chiristine (x-McVie) the names speak for themselves, both have voices that have refined with age, both get an A+. John McVie still the shy one, hiding in the shadows, speaks when spoken to, If his momma could see him now. <br />You can see there is still tention between band members. And Stevie Nicks realy lets Buckingham have it in \\"Silver Springs\\", but they end \\"Landslide\\" with a hug, both in tears. <br />Mick Fleetwood and Lindsey Buckingham have became two of the best musicians of our life times. Fleetwood is a giant that plays drums with unbelievable ease. Buckingham there are no words to define his skill in banjo like playing as lead guitarist. I know of no other who comes even close to accomplishing the skill as has Lindsey Buckingham. Buckingham's \\" I'm So Afraid\\" brings out the very best of Fleetwood and Buckingham, after all the years they have played the song and in so many ways, most not so good, They finally hit it on the head here. The Dance, DVD (sideA) has it all great picture and sound like no other Music DVD i have seen to date. If you have The Dance on CD you are probably thinking, what is she talking about. The CD and DVD are not the same, even the song line up is differant, I have both. <br />Filmed in conjunction with MTV over three nights at Warner Bros. sound stage in Burbank, the band performs titles such as \\"Gold Dust Woman,\\"\\"Over My Head.\\" \\"Dreams,\\" and \\"You Make Loving Fun\\" as well as such favorites as \\"Rhiannon,\\" \\"Say You Love Me,\\" \\"Gypsy\\", \\"Landslide,\\" and \\"Silver Springs\\", and a unbeliveable performance of \\"TUSK\\" and \\"Don't Stop (Thinking About Tomorrow),\\" when joined in with by the U.S.C. Trojan Marching Band. <br />If you like Fleetwood Mac, you will not be dissapointed with this DVD.  <br />
B0006L16N8|5.0|Square One sounds like U2 and Twisted Logic sounds like Radiohead.  Further, the lyrics are not as sharp compared to the previous two albums becomes flat during the chorus of each song).  With that said, this is an amazing album that is likely to please, but not blow away, old and new Coldplay fans.
0684859106|5.0|What sweet treats Alyssa Torey and Jennifer Appel whip up in this wonderful cookbook! I haven't yet had the good fortune of visiting the Magnolia Bakery when in NYC but I've heard so much about them. I'm a sucker for classic old-fashioned desserts (Mexican family, loving the kitchen, all sorts of goodies, what can I tell you?) and got this book along with the \\"More From Magnolia\\". Well... in the course of only a few days, I'd baked about 5 different desserts from both the books. They're wonderful! The Chocolate Buttermilk Cake with Chocolate Buttercream was an especially big hit... marvelous! <br /> <br />It's true that this book is not a primer on baking and you should have at least a basic knowledge but the instructions are easy to follow and the pointers very helpful. I have to disagree with the reviewers who state that the recipes don't come out right. I love baking but I'm certainly no pro and I haven't had any problems whatsoever, neither have any friends or family members who have borrowed them.  <br /> <br />So, yes, expect to be breaking your diet often with the sweet, sugary goodness that you find in between the pages of this wonderful book. Very, very recommended!
B0009I7NNA|3.0|Well A7x dissapointed lots of us by cutting out the screams, as many other bands have done. It's not really THAT big of a deal to me, considering the fact that I like this band mostly for their guitar. But nevertheless, the screaming helped get the hardcore guitar riff point accross. Now, what this album did was tell everyone that we missed the point. They came off as a metalcore phenomenon on Waking The Fallen, but they really are a modern day Ac/Dc on City of Evil. Whateva, I'll still buy it.
B00000J2PH|5.0|You made me feel like a natural listener  <br /> <br />This album really deserved the 4 grammys conquered.(including album of the year,1971) <br />Carole King managed to make lovely and excellent songs just with <br />piano,cello and voice: Tapestry, You make me feel like a natural woman, <br />You've got a friend. <br />The sweetness and perfection is mantained on the other tracks. <br />Tapestry was Carole's work that I liked most until today (according <br />to Music, City Streets and Simple Things) <br />James Taylor(one of my idols) plays acoustic guitar here in some tracks: <br />2, 7,6,9 and 4. <br />Pay attention: buy the re-release; you'll win 2 bonus tracks. <br />This cd is good to introduce new listeners to this thorough pianist. <br />A true masterpiece.
B0006L16N8|4.0|Nobody can deny that X&Y is an exceptional album.  It is well put together and for a follow-up to the phenomenal A RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD it is very good. Despite the fact that it is one of the better albums of 2005 and a good album in any perspective that you look at it from, it does have a few flaws, which are minor.<br /><br />Chris Martin, as critics have already been attesting to, does sound incredibly a lot like Bono from U2 here.  In some respects that is a good thing, but in others it isn't because Bono is practically a legend and Martin is releasing the group's 3rd album and Martin needs to make sure he differentiates himself from Bono.  Is it that big of a deal? No.<br /><br />Also, some of the songs sound too much based upon chord progressions than actual songwriting. As a songwriter myself, it is hard not to drabble in chord progressions as the basis of songs.  Ocassionally, on a song like \\"A Message\\", the repetitive chord progression is too obvious and it makes it a weaker track.  One of the drawing factors of Coldplay is the fact that their overall musicality is based on being simple and almost organic (independent rock in the nutshell) so they pull off simplicity much better than others.  With that said, sometimes X&Y grows a bit too mellow and too blue and it makes it feel somewhat too light or a slight bit boring or uninspired.  That is in part do to Martin's vocals and the music itself. These minorflaws weren't part of A RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD and you sometimes get the feeling that Coldplay is trying just a bit too hard to be consistent with that unexpected monster of an album or even to surpass its excellence. That is the major difference between their best album A RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD and its follow-up, X&Y. They don't quite make the mark, but they do make an incredible album.<br /><br />1. \\"Square One\\"- good, but weake compared to the stunning \\"Politik\\" that opens A RUSH OF BLOOD... 3.5/5<br /><br />2. \\"What If\\"- nice subtle piano lines by Martin, very expressive song, one of the album's best 5/5<br /><br />3. \\"White Shadows\\" 3.5/5<br /><br />4. \\"Fix You\\"- My favorite album track; beautiful piano lines, brilliant organ, chilling gorgeous vocals & vocal harmonies 5+/5<br /><br />5.  \\"Talk\\"- good, but not a standout track 3/5<br /><br />6. \\"X & Y\\"- beautiful music, beautiful vocals, as a lot of title tracks of the album it doesn't stand out as much as some of the tracks 4.5/5<br /><br />7. \\"The Speed of Sound\\"- A good track but somewhat overhyped;  a \\"Clocks\\" soundalike but it is less inspired and does quite capture the brilliance that \\"Clocks\\" did 4.5/5<br /><br />8. \\"A Message\\"- a song where Martin sounds particularly like Bono, chord progression makes the song a little boring, especially right after \\"The Speed of Sound\\" 3.5/5<br /><br />9. Low- 3.5/5<br /><br />10. \\"The Hardest Part\\"- nice falsetto which Martin exhibits throughout the album, really prominent here, one of the better tracks on the album 4.5/5<br /><br />11. \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\" 3/5<br /><br />12. \\"Twisted Logic\\"- Nice timbre to this particular song, different chord progression makes it much more interesting that some of the other songs and much better than the song before it \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\" 4.5/5<br /><br />13. [Hidden Track]- 3/5<br /><br />Overall, this album far surpasses a lot of rock albums being released this year by a mile.  This is clearly a 4 star affair, no matter what flaws you emcompass.

B0006L16N8|2.0|yes, it would have been okay if we had not heard the same album twice before. it is well known that coldplay have a very straightforward formula and sound. they take no risks, and for the most part, they are rewarded. mind you, there is nothing wrong with the same thing time and time again. compelling music is compelling music, there need not be innovation if one can endlessly produce beautiful music. there just cannot be a let down, because when there is one, it is magnified tenfold due to the repetition. x and y is a letdown. In coldplays case, they started with their formula on parachutes and made the same style on a bigger budget for arobtth. x&y is the same album, yet the problem here is that coldplay have cornered themselves in their alley of fame. they were to catious to take a turn off because the alley they were on was so great. no, theyve reached a dead end, paying the price for trying to live up to the same thing time and time again. regardless of what anyone says, and i mean anyone, their music is not as potent here! yes, maybe because its the third time around, but their sound seems lacking. speed of sound is a seemigly wonderful song, yet look at it structure, and you find that is nothing more than a shameless ripoff of clocks. you wonder why they delayed so long for EMI. did they not have a single that could sell to the mainstream, so they recorded a shallow relatively weak rip off of one of their own songs?  Even the lyrics find themselves worn down.  martin has always applied relatively personal and self absorbed lyrics in coldplay's songs. it has helped people relate, understand and feel for the music. yet where on parachutes and arobtth they seemed original (martin made yellow into a beautiful color) on x&y, he slings cliches at will. \\"my song is love\\" and \\"i could write a song a hundred miles long.\\" \\"you belong with me?\\"  even the song titles, \\"a message\\" and \\"the hardest part\\"?? martin croons with even more urgency, seemingly beggin listeners togoo over his well tuned falsetto. yet theres nothing here that warrants gooing. this album is flawed, both sonically and lyrically. it is un-original, but it is uncompellingly unoriginal. whereas arrobtth and parachutes were not groundbreaking, they may have been heart breaking. and stop with the complaints about measuring it up to their other albums. all bands must be judged by what they have previously created. it is their sound, their blueperint for how they have evolved as an artist. Even if x&y had come first, it still remains their weakest album sonically. their is no passion, no chilligness. you wonder what coldplay would create if the decieded to get their hands dirty or their feet wet. the single most frustrating thing here is that coldplay does not capture the chills and shivers their music was once capable of delivering. This smells like a sell-out, and although i will not go that far to say it, this it is bad music by coldplays standard. coldplay seems to have become content with selling millions of records, and not challenging themselves. and yes, thats fine, only if they continue to make good music. this is okay music, music that gets played on your local radios all the time, the same stations that worship dave matthews regardless of the pathetic crap that they continue to create. this is vaccum music, soulless ballads that get sucked up by the mainstream. if this is a sellout, and i ask for it not to be because coldplay has shown that they can create compelling music, but if it is, then i seriosuly suggest that all of you consider what coldplay stands for in the music world.
B00012ML9K|4.0|Well to describe how I felt about this CD would take too much time so I will just keep this short and simple. I first saw Rufus Wainwright on a TV show and I heard some of his music and knew that I got to hear more of it so I did but I made the mistake of buying Want Two instead of buying Want One first. When I finally got a hold of Want One I listened to it and felt that Want Two was a lot better than Want One for many different reasons. I recommand that you buy Want One first and then buy Want Two that way you'll understand it more. I kinda thought it was hard to understand some of the storyline I didn't hear what most people said it was about but oh well. All in all it was a great CD.
B0009A1AS2|3.0|Yes it all comes down to this very heated discussion fans have had time and time again...So which school do you?..Which school do I belong to?.. <br />    You see two qualities dream theater have always maintained in their music:technical artistry and creativity..This is very evident on SDOIT,SFAM,Images and words and awake..Now which one of these qulalities does octavarium posess?...IN my opinion--NONE(the first 6 songs anyway)...its all essentially 4 5 mod rock/pop chord progressions packaged beautifully and probably mastered and remastered n number of times!..People!!...Dont get dis-illusioned by the dolby digital orchestra!OR the Fancy album art!...Its the music that counts at the end of the day!...Whats happened to Portnoy and petrucci!!!...Where have all the extravagent roles starting in the middle of a bar and ending in the middle of the next insane time signature bar gone!!..Where are the God like,finger twisting solos!!...Why am I hearing so Much REM,u2 and muse and No dream theater (first 6 songs)..This is very disappointing from a band that lays the bar for prog (like radiohead!)...Looks like some one has suddenly put money as the prime priority( as opposed to artistic integrety!)..and have hence become the Oasis of the prog world..Well thats a little harsh maybe considering the breath taking last 34 minutes!!.Including the wapping vocal performance by labrie in sacrificed sons and ofourse the epic that almost tops SDOIT (the song) octavarium- a psychadelic masterpiece of the modern day!!..And mind you 34 minutes is a large chunk!--so its good enough to take their album from a 2 star to a 3 and a half maybe... <br />   But I really hope DT get back to their SFAM,SDOIT days..And well I would recomend this album if youre a fan of floyd...But Id really advise u to skip to the last two tracks!..if u do that..the album is quite a masterpiece!!!..Lol
B000001AJG|4.0|Ok, this is a Masterwork.  When I got this abum for Christmas in 1979, I played it over and over and over.  Some albums entertain you, make you dance, tell stories.  THIS album TAKES you places - inward & outward - and you realize YOU are on the Journey of the Secret Life of Plants. <br /> <br />One shortcoming - as if he had anything to prove by the late 70's, he set out to do an entire soundtrack on his own, playing all the instruments.  He succeeded in doing so, but actually sold his material short, in my opinion.  Can we hear REAL violins instead of synthesizer?  Can we hear REAL drums, REAL bass?  It's the main achilles heal that dates this great piece of songwriting, singing, and work.
B000002W9P|5.0|First, if you're an old 'Priest, old 'Maiden, 80's REAL metal fan, then you already own this album and don't need to read this review. This album is SO killer, it's definitely a must-own. I loved it on vinyl then, and love it on CD now. Yes, to today's standards, lyrically it's a bit cheesy - but WHO CARES! So is 1/2 of the other 80's metal... read the lyrics and you'll see. So here's the deal; \\"wailing\\" guitars with phenomenal harmonies, a bass line this is not just part of the rhythm section - it provides it's own power and stands out on its own. The drums? Like I said, just good ole fashioned, headbangin' double bass. My neck gets sore just thinking about it. I've always thought the vocals were very similar to Geoff Tate (Queensryche) - almost operatic, but it suits the band well on this album. This is a bit of a concept album, which adds to the cheesy-ness, but this is no mainstream metal here. Every song is different and the song \\"Halloween\\" has so many changeups (in a good way) that it leaves you wondering \\"am I still listening to the same song?\\" I'm not going to review each song individually, they all rock and that's all ya need to know. So dude/chick - just buy it and ask questions later. Enjoy.
1400032717|2.0|I was very excited by the beginning of this story because it gave me insight into the minds of the autistic.  The author did a great job of describing this character and reminded me of several autistic students that I've had as a teacher in the past.  It seems though, that the author got too involved in the development of a great character and forgot to write a story.  It just isn't a very interesting ride that the author takes you on.  And, even if it was a story about how a character changes over time, he didn't accomplish this either.  Don't waste your time with this one...I don't know what all these other reviewers could be so amazed by.
0790749815|5.0|I hold this to be Alfred Hitchcock's finest film, but to say that rather shortchanges the British genius as it happens to be one of the greatest movies of all time.  North by Northwest is what I would call \\"old school cool,\\" and there has never been, before or since, a more charming or likeable actor than Cary Grant.  I dare anybody to take their eyes off this one--even to go to the bathroom.  This marks the third time I've seen it and I found it just as fulfilling as the two before it.<br /><br />James Mason was an amazing actor and I'd place him just below Olivier on the talent meter.  Here he plays a perfect nemesis for Grant as a foreign agent who \\"imports/exports\\" information to the east during The Cold War.  In this role, Mason is quite believeable.<br /><br />Eva Marie Saint is exceptional and the love that develops between herself and Grant is something that the audience readily buys into.  There's nothing contrived about their relationship.  It makes the movie just as much a romance as a thriller.<br /><br />Unlike the movies fabricated today, there is no sex or nudity to be seen here, but we are made to fully understand the emotions of the characters.  The dialogue between Grant and Saint is absolutely precious, particularly when they meet on the train and speak in the dining car.  Words like these are seldom heard in the movies of the present: \\"How does a girl like you get to be a girl like you?\\"  And my favorite:<br /><br />\\"Men like you don't believe in marriage.\\"<br /><br />\\"But I've been married twice.\\"<br /><br />\\"See what I mean.\\"<br /><br />One wishes that some of these exchanges were examined before screenplays were stamped out in this new century.<br /><br />The entire movie is shot in the \\"man alone\\" motif as Grant, ala Gary Cooper, stands up to forces far superior than himself.  His resourcefulness is the glue that binds the plot together. This advertising executive is quite successful in outpacing East German (presumably) agents and the police who are out to hang him. The ending is marvelous but, of course, in case you're one of the rare people who has never seen it, I will not give the climax away.out to hang him. The ending is marvelous but, of course, in case you're one of the rare people who has never seen it, I will not give the climax away.
0312979479|5.0|And Then There Were None : A Novel is a classic who dunit story written by the incredible Agatha Christie. The story centers on a group of people whom have all been summoned to an island. The plot is thick with suspense, psychology and moral and ethical issues. The descriptors used are great and the story is multi faceted and one never is able to figure out the killer and when it is revelead I was quite shocked. This is how good who dunit stories work and \\"an then there were none\\" is one of the best ever written. Splendid, indeed.
0060556501|5.0|This book is based on the novel by C.S. Lewis and is therefor not the actual text.  It is a well written summary of the story, which can be read aloud in one sitting to young children without losing their interest. The book introduces them to the classic tale in a way that is appropriate for them.  The text goes very well with the illustrations, which are gorgeous.  It is written in a way that keeps the children wanting to turn the pages to see what happens to the characters.   While it's true that the message of the story is diluted, it would be easy for an adult familiar with the novel to add little bits of age appropriate explanation here and there so the children get more of the intended message if they wish to do so.   <br /> <br />  I really like this book, and have used it with my preschool class (children of ages 3 1/5 to 4) and with kindergarteners (ages 5-6).  At first I thought it was a little risky because the text is much longer than most picture books we use with the younger ones, and some of the children have really short attention spans.  But I also felt the story was good enough and the illustrations interesting enough to keep their attention.  I was right.  The children listened intently and wanted to know everything about the story.  It was beautiful to see how even children as young as 3 were enjoying the tale by C.S. Lewis in a circle time setting at school.  I recommend this book to parents and teachers who love Narnia and want to introduce it to young children who are not quite ready to read the original text.   <br />

B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day come back strong after a 4 year hiatus. American Idiot is the first pop-punk rock opera and it's a great one. All-out rockers, power ballads galore, it holds together as a collection of great songs and as a story (sort of).    1. American Idiot - A loud rocker to kick it all off. A protest song against Bush but also an introduction that the character doesn't want to be the right-winger conservative Bush lover.    2. Jesus of Suburbia - Reminiscent of Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody, but not as a story. More of an introduction to the character.    I. Jesus of Suburbia - The son of Rage and Love gets his television fix sitting on his crucifix. He uses alcohol and cigarettes and Mary Jane to keep himself insane, doing someone else's cocaine. Hates his mom and Brad. Not a happy kid.    II. City of the Damned - Jesus of Suburbia is not happy with the town he lives in. He hangs out in the Parking Lot of the 7-11 where all was taught.    III. I Don't Care - Indifference.    IV. Dearly Beloved - His mental state. He feels he's in between insane and insecure.    V. Tales of Another Broken Home - Jesus of Suburbia runs away from home.    3. Holiday - Isolated Protest song. Strong as hell. Calls the Governator of California a Nazi and calls Bush the President Gas Man. One of the best songs on the album.    4. Boulevard of Broken Dreams - Back to the story, Jesus of Suburbia is on the street, on the Blvd of Broken Dreams. He walks alone. Great power ballad. Also one of best.    5. Are We The Waiting - The calm before the storm. Jesus of Suburbia is waiting for something to happen.    6. St Jimmy - We explode into and introduction of St Jimmy, the guy your mother warned you about. He's a son of a gun.    7. Give Me Novacaine - Acoustic and electric guitars to make a great power ballad about St Jimmy introducing Jesus of Suburbia to drugs, to take away the pain. Also one of the strongest tracks on the album.    8. She's a Rebel - Whatsername is introduced. A rebel, a saint, vigilante. A symbol of resistance. She's holding on to Jesus of Suburbia's heart like a hand grenade. Jesus of Suburbia likes this girl.    9. Extraordinary Girl - Jesus of Suburbia and Whatsername aren't happy together. This song shows how they feel about each other. How sometimes he feels like dying and how she gets so sick of crying.    10. Letterbomb - Whatsername breaks up with Jesus of Suburbia. She sends him a letter asking questions like: \\"Where have all the bastards gone?\\" and \\"Where have all the riots gone?\\" She couldn't take the town or Jesus of Suburbia. She left him.    11. Wake Me Up When September Ends - Great power ballad. Might be another isolated song. Rumoured to be about September 11th, but I heard it was about Billy Joe Armstrong's father's death. It could also be interpreted to be Jesus of Suburbia feeling bummed out about all he's been through and nothing getting solved. Regardless, it's a great song, 10 times sadder than \\"Time of Your Life (Good Riddance).\\"    12. Homecoming    I. Death of St Jimmy - St Jimmy gets fed up with Jesus of Suburbia and blows his brains out into the bay.    II. East 12th Street - Jesus of Suburbia is doing paperwork now. He's got a boring desk job and hates his life more. He wants somebody to get him out of here.    III. Nobody Likes You - The chant that came in Letterbomb, \\"Nobody Likes You, Everyone Left You, They're all out without you Havin' Fun\\" is a song. The chant is reminiscent of The Who - Tommy's \\"See Me, Feel Me, Touch Me, Heal Me.\\" Jesus of Suburbia is all alone.    IV. Rock and Roll Girlfriend - I think this part is about Jesus of Suburbia telling St Jimmy about him being a rock and roll star having a rock and roll life. I'm not exactly sure but it works and it's a nice rock out segment of the song.    V. We're Coming Home Again - I think this segment is about Jesus of Suburbia going back home. It's triumphant and kind of bitter.    13. Whatsername - A (relatively) quiet piece about Jesus of Suburbia reminiscing about Whatsername. He remembers the face he can't recall the name. He also made a point to burn all of the photographs. He wants to forget her but not the time. Great closing piece.      This album is about the war between rage and love.        SPOILER! SPOILER! SPOILER!    There is a spoiler below, so don't read it if you don't want to know.      Jesus of Suburbia is St Jimmy. St Jimmy is the equivalent of Tyler Durden in Fight Club. An imaginary friend.    In Letterbomb, Whatsername writes: \\"St Jimmy is just a figment of your father's rage and your mother's love.\\"    When St Jimmy blew his brains out, it was a private suicide inside Jesus of Suburbia's head.
B0007YMUZW|4.0|Ryan Adams is a turbo-pimp and my favorite singer/songwriter going. Cold Roses is another solid effort from the former Whiskeytown frontman. Standout tracks are the single \\"Let it Ride\\" and my favorite \\"Dance All NIght,\\" among others. There is what I would consider some filler here however, and the album could probably have benefitted from a little editing, perhaps pairing it down to a single cd of 10-14 songs or so. But then, he's arguable the most prolific musician around and that's part of what makes him so appealing to his fans. Two more albums are scheduled from Mr. Adams later this year, which I for one, will be anxiously awaiting. If you're looking for Ryan's best album to date, that would be \\"Gold,\\" in my humble opinion.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|This album is half of a two-disc set (the other half will be released later in 2005). That probably explains why it is so short. Regardless, it loses a star for lack of length. Now, on to the positive things! System's Drummer (John) has gotten much better. He plays faster and harder. Daron also sings a lot more on this album (I think he has a better voice than Serj), and he has also gotten better at playing the guitar (the guitar riffs in B.Y.O.B. are amazing). Serj is still a good singer, but he's vocals can be a bit boring at times. The political messages this album puts forward really don't make much sense to me, but that doesn't really matter. If you are a die hard System fan, pick this up. If not, pick up a copy of their self-titled debut album instead.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|This is the movie that really reminds me of high school; it came out the summer before I started my senior year, the summer I turned 18.<br /><br />\\"Jaws\\" was the \\"Psycho\\" of my generation. I don't apply this term to \\"Halloween\\", another equally scary film of the '70's involving pointy things that can kill you, because \\"Jaws\\" and \\"Psycho\\" have too very important elements in common with each other, and \\"Halloween\\" somehow seems to fall into a different horror genre.<br /><br />Both \\"Psycho\\" and \\"Jaws\\" are about ordinary people doing something ordinary and enjoyable, two activities one would normally never find dangerous: showering, and splashing about in the shallows of the ocean.<br /><br />I don't remember, but I can't imagine that this movie made people very happy whose livelihood depended on beach tourism, as it was released in the early summer.<br /><br />Seeing \\"Psycho\\" made many people afraid to take showers (including actress Janet Leigh, who starred in it and claimed she never took another shower afterwards), and \\"Jaws\\" made many people afraid to swim in the ocean. It scared the hell out of us teenagers and made for endless pranks at the beach that summer (hey, I was 17 when it came out in the theater, what can I say)? Two of my friends would take turns pretending to be an approaching shark in the water, using his hand as a fin, while hmming the classic \\"Jaws\\" soundtrack, or pretending to be the first victim in the film (minus the screaming, which upset the lifeguards), thrashing and flailing about in the waves as if being attacked and dragged underwater.<br /><br />\\"Jaws\\" was also Steven Spielberg's first (and I think best) blockbuster. It could only help boost the careers of the 3 lead male actors in the film: Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, and Richard Dreyfuss (this was the role that made Dreyfuss a star). It spawned one of the most classic and oft-quoted lines in film history: \\"We're gonna need a bigger boat.\\" It was also technically a very innovative film, with a mechanical shark that by all accounts was a great deal of trouble.<br /><br />I hadn't seen this film in several years, having seen it umpteen times when it first came out, and several times on VHS, as I owned an old VHS copy of it. But I recently got the 30th Anniversary Edition, and saw it again last night, in the dark, in widescreen, through the stereo (gone is the full-screen only old tape).<br /><br />Suffice to say that when the head pops out of the boat...I still jump just as much as I did the first time I saw it in the theater.<br /><br />The ultimate, and best, of the \\"Scary Summer Movie\\" genre.<br /><br />This \\"Special Edition 30th Anniversary Edition\\" (widescreen, of course) of the film includes some great special features such as deleted scenes and outtakes, a never-before-available interview with Spielberg, archives, and a two-hour documentary of the making of the film. The deleted scenes and outtakes are a riot; I can certainly see why the shot of Robert Shaw's clog-sheathed foot stepping out of a big black car with the words \\"QUINT\\" in white and a white outline drawing of a shark on its door were cut!

B0009HLDFU|5.0|Best Foo effort since One by One.  This should be placed in the car CD player and have the eject button removed.  Dave screams his a** off while driving home some of the best tunes recorded in recent years.  Shame we can't give this baby 6 stars, as it deserves more than 5. <br /> <br />To all you choads that can't copy the CD...it says so right on the CD cover you puddin' heads.  Shouldn't have bought it if you wanted to rip copies.
B00005JNJT|5.0|I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED IN THE LAST TWO FILMS! WHO WASN'T? BATMAN BECAME MORE OF A HOLLYWOOD CELEBRETY, HE WAS TOO BUSY LOOKING MACHO RATHER THAN MYSTERIOUS, ROBIN WAS A PATHETIC ADDITION, THE VILLAINS WERE ALL BRAINLESS NUTJOBS WITH PATHETIC LINES, AND TO TOP IT OFF GOTHAM LOOKED MORE LIKE LAS VEGAS RATHER THEN SOME GOTHIC CITY!  ANY OF THIS FOUND IN \\"BEGINS\\"? NOPE! CHRISTIAN BALE WHO HAS BEEN ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTORS EVER SINCE I SAW HIM ON AMERICAN PSYCHO IS BY FAR THE BEST BATMAN YET.  HIS ACTING WAS SUPERB.  THE MOVIE FOCUSED FAR MORE ON BATMAN THAN ANY OTHER PERSON IN THE FILM ALTHOUGH I REALLY LIKED GARY OLDMAN'S PERFORMANCE AS AN EARLY DAYS LIEUTENANT GORDON.  KATIE HOLMES ALTHOUGH PLEASANT TO LOOK AT WAS SADLY WASTED IN THIS MOVIE.  MORGAN FREEMAN SHINES AS ALWAYS AS HE DID IN OTHER MOVIES LIKE SEVEN AND LEAN ON ME AS BRUCE WAYNES PARTNER AND FRIEND LUCIUS FOX.  CILLIAN MURPHY WHO I REALLY LIKED ON 28 DAYS LATER WAS THE PERFECT PICK FOR DR. JONATHAN CRANE AKA THE SCARECROW. LIAM NEESON WHO SURPRISED ME A LOT IN THIS MOVIE WAS AWE-INSPIRING AS THE INSTRUCTOR FOR BRUCE WAYNE IN THE WAYS OF THE NINJA. HIS TRANSITION TO AN ANTAGONIST LATER ON IN THE MOVIE WAS REDICULOUSLY PERFECT. NO OTHER ACTOR COULD HAVE PULLED IT OFF.  AND TO TOP IT OFF, MICHAEL CAINE AS THE ALWAYS FUNNY AND AT THE SAME TIME UPTIGHT FAITHFUL BUTLER ALFRED PENNYWORTH.  HIS PERFORMANCE EASILY RIVALED MICHAEL GOUGH'S PERFORMANCE IN THE OTHER FILMS AND EVEN SURPASSED IT AT TIMES.  HE'S SO SERIOUS IN THIS MOVIE AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES HIM FUNNY.  CHRISTIAN BALE IS STILL THE TOP HOMBRE IN THIS FILM.  HE PORTRAYS THE TROUBLED YOUNG BRUCE WAYNE IN A WAY THAT SHOWS THE VIEWER THAT THERE REALLY IS A SCARED AND VENGEFUL CHILD BEHIND THAT PLAYBOY IMAGE.  LIKE I SAID, BALE IS BY FAR THE BEST OUT OF ALL THE BATMANS, YES EVEN BETTER THAN THE AWESOME MICHAEL KEATON!  IF YOU ARE HOPING FOR A VINDICATION FROM THE LAST TWO FILMS OR EVEN ALL OF THEM, THIS IS IT!  PLEASE GO SEE IT! I WANT MORE SEQUELS!
B00005QDW1|5.0|This is my favorite cd by No Doubt and it shows why they are my favorite band.  This album was all about expanding the sound of the band and experimenting...and well, they did it right.  All of the songs sound unique and refreshing.  The lyrics aren't deep at all but some of them are pretty clever.  Every single song on here just makes you want to get up and dance. The cd starts with one of my favorites \\"Hella Good\\" a song produced by the Neptunes.  It has a great guitar riff and its just so much goodness rolled into one song.  \\"Hey Baby\\" is fun and catchy..but not the best song on the album.  \\"In My Head\\" is one of my favorites and is probably the poppiest songs on the cd..but there is nothing wrong with pop. \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" has an 80ish sound to it and is my favorite track on the album. there isn't enough room on here to explain every song and why I love them so much.  The flow of the cd is great and each song goes great beside each other.  Everything about this cd is great..its so much awesomeness rolled into one album! You won't be dissapointed!
B0009I7NNA|5.0|this album is awesome.I was a little worried when hearing there would be no screams on this album but after listening to it constantly I was hooked. At first listen I was a bit dissapointed by the poppy chorus' but after buying and reading the lyrics the deal was sealed. Awesome guitar (power metal at its finest) Awesome bass, super banging drums, and wide range vocals.If anyone doesnt like this album its probably the vocals that are to blame but I think they are quite good.Shadows has a Axl Rose/Mike Patton/Rob Halford/Phil Anselmo/ lead singer to Bad Religion thing going on and I think it works perfectly. So buy this album twice and have an open mind.
B000001Y79|3.0|No Doubt is my favorite band because they are innovative, always changing, fun..and they make great music.  Tragic Kingdom was one of No Doubts biggest hits because of its catchy tunes.  Tragic Kingdom has some great songs like \\"Dont Speak\\", which is there biggest song ever.  \\"Sunday Morning\\" is probably my favorite No Doubt song ever.  \\"Just a Girl\\" and \\"Spiderwebs\\" are also good songs...but the other songs on here are mediocre to me.  This cd is pretty good but not as good as Return of Saturn and my favorite Rock Steady.  Some of the songs go on for too long...and some of the tunes can get a little annoying.  This cd was a huge step from there self-titled album and The Beacon Street Collection...but just not as great as there follow-ups.  This cd is still a must for any No Doubt fan...or any music fan.

B000935TV8|5.0|Minkowski's Handel is usually a mixed bag and I'm not fully convinced that he is a true Handelian; however, the French baroque in general and Rameau in particular is where this beguiling young maestro, more often than not, shines. I love Rameau, his melodic inventiveness, his unerring good taste and grace, his Gallic wit and refinement and no where is this more prevalent than in his operas.  From William Christie we have come to expect restrained elegance and with Christophe Rousset a delicate, introspective hand is always at work; both men yield extraordinary results.  In this case, however, the heart lies in the drama, in the intensity of it all.  Minkowski foregoes a little of the elegance to get to the pulse of the music at its most elemental.  There is blood and guts here, folks and not just the pretty divertissements devised for the amusement of the French court and countless idle nobility that most people associate with this musical style. Too often baroque music, especially French baroque, is handled with too much finesse and fussiness, as though it were an enormous Limoges plate in a museum exhibition and it's very refreshing to hear it with this kind of oomph and stirring relevance.  Tempo's are on the fast side, but Minkowski is not known for cautious speeds and deliberate pacing; he's more often about fireworks and sometimes that works and other times it doesn't.  We're clearly in the first category here.  It works and works well.  I found it an exhilarating release and though some may not care too much for Minkowski's intense approach, few will deny its visceral impact
B0007YMUZW|4.0|I was into Whiskeytown. Then lost track along the spew of RA solo releases. It was a lot to keep up with. And the sound kept darting in new directions. The critics didn't help. \\"Cold Roses\\" brings it all back home ... and into a whole new perspective. Adams is finally rightfully presenting himself as an ambitious, eclectic songwriter and song-stylist whose vision is unpredictable without caprice. Okay ... having said that: \\"Easy Plateau\\" and \\"Magnolia Mountain\\" are stuck in my head and I don't want to let 'em go. I will now gleefully re-explore RA's entire catalog with new ears. And I await every surprise this artist has yet to commit to posterity.
B0000026WD|5.0|This album was underrated at its time. Compared to other albums of Michael Jackson, The artistic style of Dangerous took such a dramatic turn from its predecessors (Bad, Thriller, etc.) that one might feel it is bizarre. However this album is truly innovative, artistic, and comprehensive. It's noteable that the vocal style of Michael Jackson has been changing since Thriller. Artistically, Dangerous is truly a triumph, for which we have to give credits to Michael Jackson and its crews.    In my opinion, among all the tracks, 'Jam', 'Black or White', 'Dangerous', 'Who is it'' are truly outstanding. Other than that, 'In the Closet', 'Remember the Time', 'Will you be there', 'Heal the World', 'Give in to me' are also very good.    Get this record, it is timeless at least for 2 or 3 decades.
B0007OCG56|5.0|I really LOVED this movie, very poignant and funny too. Regardless of differences between people there are always points of intersection if your willing to find them and this film explores the subject artfully. A recurring theme throughout is that being as good a parent as you're capable of is the most important thing.
B00007KWI9|5.0|Before Yes achieved commercial success with their 1971 classic, \\"The Yes Album,\\" they recorded a pair of albums in 1969 and 1970. This is the 1969 self-titled debut for Yes, and it's an outstanding first chapter in the long career of this enduring band. Although it contains no epic-length songs, \\"Yes\\" features all of the group's trademark ingredients, including awesome vocal harmonies & musical interplay, on such songs as the pounding rock of \\"Beyond And Before\\" and \\"Looking Around,\\" the beautiful \\"Yesterday And Today\\" and \\"Survival,\\" and a very clever cover version of the Beatles' \\"Every Little Thing\\" (with a dash of \\"Day Tripper\\" tossed in for extra measure). Jon Anderson's falsetto lead vocals are superb, Chris Squire plays a mean bass, Tony Kaye's organ & piano work throughout is impressive, Bill Bruford's drumming is powerful, and, preceding Steve Howe, original guitarist Peter Banks serves up some amazing fretwork, whether he's rocking out or playing softly (the quiet guitar section on \\"Survival\\" alone is one of the most hypnotic pieces of guitar-playing I've ever heard---it's so simple, and yet it's absolutely gorgeous, thanks in no small part to Banks' playing). \\"Yes\\" is a great debut for this legendary band.
B00023BLXK|5.0|This movie starts out tame to introduce our main character Katey, then subtly introduces Javier.  After our introductions it moves past that to introduce the wonderful latin dancing.  The dancing in this movie really gives a great look on latin dancing.  I really enjoyed the fact that they introduced what was going on during 1958-1959 in cuba. If they would have left the politics out we as audiences would be lost as to what the fuss is all about with Katey being in love with a cuban, Javier and why the cubans were being prosecuted for doing their thing and being as free as the Americans.  The actor and actress did a great job at performing and truly looked in love throughout the movie.  I hope to see more of them.  Diego Luna was very hot in this movie and could really dance.  This movie was truly impressive and has inspired me to look into more about cuban history and latin dancing. I've started taking ballroom dancing because of this movie.... I hope you all enjoy this movie as much as i did! It is a great movie with alot to enjoy.
B00007KWHO|5.0|The 2nd Yes album, 1970's \\"Time And A Word,\\" saw the band add some orchestral arrangements to some of their songs. Some fans were turned off by it, and even Yes themselves now say they don't think the orchestral touches on the album worked completely (and the band would not take on orchestral accompanyment again until 2001's \\"Magnification\\"). Personally, I'm not bothered one bit by the orchestral flourishes. They don't *bury* the band, for heaven's sake, and I think they enhance the songs that they're used on very well. Yes themselves are still the main attraction throughout \\"Time And A Word,\\" and the album is excellent. It features several of my personal favorite Yes songs, such as the amazing cover of Richie Havens' \\"No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed,\\" the captivating sounds of \\"Then,\\" the perfect pop-rock of \\"Sweet Dreams,\\" the supremely powerful rock of \\"Astral Traveller\\" (with a killer guitar riff from Peter Banks), and the great beauty of the closing title track. The band are in top form on \\"Time And A Word,\\" as they also say goodbye to guitarist Banks, who would be replaced by longtime guitarist Steve Howe shortly after the album's release (SO shortly, in fact, that the original US album cover features a group photo with Howe, even though Banks is the guitarist on the album!). I've always loved \\"Time And A Word.\\" It's a very strong Yes album, and I highly recommend it.
B0006L16N8|3.0|While the album isn't lacking in some great songs, namely Speed of Sound and Low, something just seems amiss about it and that seems strange with all the hype surrounding its release. <br /> <br />Rush of Blood and Parachutes both contain material that seemed fresh and new and overall, both were great albums. <br /> <br />Maybe that is the problem with X&Y. The past two albums have said all that Coldplay are saying in this new album. They seem to be sticking with a formula that has previously worked instead of branching out and delivering something new and exciting. While this may work, it makes for quite a dull listen, seeming almost insipid. <br /> <br />If you're a fan of Coldplay's earlier works you shouldn't be too disappointed - if you are not a fan of their earlier works, this one will not deliver anything to change your mind.
B0009I7O7U|5.0|I came across this CD by accident, and it has been one of my BEST purchases! GREAT R&B-type sound, but a little more edgy. His voice has this indescribeable quality to it - the closest I can come is soul-FULL (to differentiate from the simple \\"soulful\\", which doesn't do it justice). You will NOT regret buying this. It's not soft, mushy love songs that sound just like everyone else - the songs are about REAL life, REAL love - just GET IT!
B000060MWU|1.0|i completely did not understand this movie at all.  If you go to look in a cell to check on whoever and see another person in there, do you just say \\"this is weird\\" or go look for the person missing.  It has Bill Pullman in the first hour then he disappears for a while and it's another guy.  Maybe this movie is just to complicated for me to understand, but i do know it's slow and the whole thing with the video tape and Robert Blake is just too miss placed.  Plus this movie is weird.
B000001ESF|5.0|....if you're not yet a devout Rush fan.  Rush's 4th album was the classic 2112.  By far their most well-known epic, the song 2112 is a nearly-twenty minute long song about the year 2112, where a communist-type dictatorship has outlawed all things that give enjoyment, especially music.  The hero of the piece finds a guitar in a cave and teaches himself to play it, but when he goes to the temple to show the high priests what he has found and what it can do, they denounce him and his music and destroy the guitar.  Distraught, he kills himself, only to miss the revolution and overthrow of the Red Star of the Solar Federation that his music inspired.  Cheesy and pretentious? Probably, but it was the 1970's, these guys have more than the chops musically to back it up, and it ROCKS like no one's business.  The rest of the album is solid, with A Passage to Bangkok and Something For Nothing being other stellar tracks.  Lessons is decent, and Twilight Zone is chinzy but fun.  Tears is kind of lame, but it's alright.  All in, a classic and the album that set Rush on the path to superstardom.  And dig that picture of the guys in their Star Wars-style costumes on the inner sleeve...CLASSIC.
B00009L1TA|4.0|I thought this was a good movie.  Very entertaining.  But it get's really confusing with all the plot twists and plot holes it has throughout the movie.
B00004Z459|5.0|i dont know what most of you are complaining about but this album brings back memories of when i was 15 years old so all of you shut up! this is Real Rock Music for all of you Inflame, Napalm, and Finch fans, put a D!ck in  you mouth and shut it cuz this is Real Rock Music LOL!!
B000001EUN|4.0|this is the 5th Scorpions cd I've bought and once again they do not dissapoint.      1.Make it Real- from the first time i heard this track, i liked it.  The flow is silky smooth in the verses and sounds just as good in the chorus.  I like the first line when Klaus sings \\"you can always trust your inner feelings because they will always tell the truth\\"  good lyrics too.  inspirational as well.      2. Don't make no Promises- This song is soooooo dirty, I love it.  It's all about sex and it goes great with the fast paced guitars.  This song is under 3 minutes so you can listen to it a few times before you get tired of it.      3. Hold me tight- another good song, not as good as their others but still good.  I like the rhythym guitar playing throughout the verses.    4. Twentieth Century Man-  This song is just ok to me.  I tend to skip past this track when I hear this cd.  There's nothing wrong with this song, it just doesnt really stand out to me.     5.Lady StarLight-  I love the music in this song.  So pretty and calming.  I can totally feel his emotion in this song, much better than your typical ballad.  Not sure which is better though, \\"Lady Starlight\\" or \\"Still Loving You\\".  I guess time will tell me.  8.5/10    6. Falling in love- I liked this song right away.  Its so in your face without trying to.  The chorus is a lot of fun to sing as well \\" falling in love....ahhh oooooo falling in love\\"  this a track I'll listen to a few times before I change it.  This song was written completely by their drummer, even the guitars.     7. Only a man-  Klaus is pissed in this song. LOVE IT. Never really heard him cuss before so you know hes pissed when hes cussing in this song.  He's saying that hes doing all he can but t his woman is asking too much from him.  Hes trying to juggle a rock career with a love life.  Good rythem to this song as well.      8. Zoo- One of my favorite Scorpion songs of all time.  This song is so simple yet in your face as well.  Starts off witha little bang then goes into a silky smooth bass mixing with a very familiar guitar riff.  I love how klaus almost whispers the verses sounding very calm but in the chorus he just lets it all out.  Great song to listen to.      9. Animal Magnetism- has a very hypnotic intro, what am i saying the whole song with mesmerize you. Dont drive on the highway listening to this or you will lose track of driving, it really grabs you that much.  I've fallen asleep to this song before, not because its boring but it has such a silky smooth flow that it really entrances you.      Although this isnt my favorite scorpions albums its one of my top 20 favorite albums that I currently own.  This is a great cd to add to your Scorpions collection
B00008H2LB|5.0|people dont like linkim park because they complain and whine on there songs and call them untalented cuz they are metal/rap and there not real rock music. i dont agree there a great band for any fans its just that people these days complain rock music has to be about anger and psychotic. well for all of you thinking like that, THis is real rock music!! yea Rock On DUDE!!
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay gets everything right the third time. All the Coldplay purists come on here to crap on X&Y because they think they've got it right. But they're wrong in so many different ways I can't name them all. Who wants to waste their time rehashing every inch of an album recorded 3 years ago? Like it and take a step forward. People should learn how to move on and judge the new material for what it is. We should be celebrating Coldplay's improvement not comparing each line of AROBTTH to that of X&Y. That's so incredibly tedious. Just enjoy the music for a change. Sit back and experience what Coldplay truly has to offer. You might learn a thing or two. X&Y is a musical journey. The more often you take it, the better it will get.
0385474547|5.0|Thanks Chinua Achebe. Your title reminded me of my favorite poet W.B. Yeats as I recognize that you took your title from \\"The Second Coming.\\" A more complete quote: Things fall apart / the center will not hold / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world. Your ending came as a surprise and is perfect offering as it does an alternative title for your work, \\"The pacification of the primitive tribes of the lower Niger.\\" What impact that new title has for a political novel! Let me evaluate your book according to an essay by Wallace Stevens \\"Notes for a Supreme Fiction.\\" Stevens claims fiction should provide three things: pleasure, abstraction, and change. The story and the ease of reading your short sentences provided pleasure. The abstract ideas abound and come to the reader like the snows of winter piling up one on another. Or do the ideas blow across the page the way the harmattan blows across West Africa? Through the eyes of Okonkwo I experience and learn about the human condition as reflected in the culture of the (your?) Ibo tribe. Their money is cowries, their drug the kola nut, their religion spiritism, but the humanity remains clear and strong. In fact, their morality exceeds that of the British although that fact is never stated, just shown. The changes are enormous: The major character dies, the tribe breaks up, and the land falls into the hands of the enemy. By these Wallace Stevens standards, I believe you have written a perfect novel - A+.

B0007PALZ2|3.0|Bruce Willis (Sin City, The Die Hard Trilogy) stars in this extrodinarly weird, which probably was meant to be, but very good science fiction movie about a man named James(Willis) who volunteers to go from the future back in time to the past to prevent an outbreak of a deadly virus which may of been unleashed by a radical group called the 12 Monkeys. On his journey, Willis encounters phyciatrist Kathryn, played by Madeline Stowe (Revenge, Unlawful Entry) and mental mined Jeffrey, played by Brad Pitt (Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Se7en) who is associated with the 12 Monkeys. Directed by Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas director Terry Gillam...movie mixes various things and its one you can discuss with a friend after watching it, share your opinions to one another. Also starring Christopher Plummer (A Beautiful Mind, National Treasure), Christopher Meloni (Tv's Law and Order:SVU, Wet Hot American Summer), David Morse (The Negotiator, The Langoliers), Jon Seda (TV's Homicide:Life on the street, Undisputed) and the late Frank Gorshin (TV'S Batman). Bruce Willis is still top notch in his performance matched with Brad Pitt in a insanely good one who sprouts a crazy left eye.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This album isn't short on excellence, ideas, or imagination. And yes, there is a Music God as some reviews have alluded to. \\"X&Y\\" is a demonstration of great music and great talent. And when you combine the two, you get something extraordinary. SQUARE ONE has to be one of the best openers that I've heard on any album. It makes the entire album feel otherworldly. While others are CD's are hanging in this stratosphere, \\"X&Y\\" takes us to the outer limits. Those claiming that this is boring or worse than AROBTTH have too much free time. This album does feel fresh and new. They did try something different. It still has the sound that they're known for, but they've clearly taken it up a notch. If you like Rock or Pop, then I would encourage you to get \\"X&Y.\\" The work on this album is high quality. I'm not a diehard fan, but I can at least recognize good work and give credit where it's due.
B0009UC7HA|3.0|Matthew McConaughey (Dazed and Confused, Reign Of Fire, EDTV) and Steve Zahn (Suburbia, HappyTexas, JoyRide) play Dirk and Al, two treasure seeking guys who set out a journey to find a ancient civil war ship with a treasure of gold coins and Penelope Cruz (Woman On Top, Vanilla Sky, Blow) plays a doctor sent to Mali in which people are being poisoned. Some pretty good action sequences boosted by the 2 male leads' lively performances. William H. Macy (Cellular, Boogie Nights,Focus), Lambert Wilson (The Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions, Timeline), Patrick Malahide and Delroy Lindo (Get Shorty, The One, Broken Arrow) also star. Much funner and better then National Treasure, though in this one they should of trimmed the time down a bit...the time kept on dragging but still its a good action/adventure movie chock full but not the best. Based on the bestselling book by author Clive Clussler.  <br />
B0002ZDVF4|1.0|I have no problem with this movie. I have a problem with the Previews before the movie. You can not go forward through the Previews. Asking to go forward often restarts the previews. What is this? If they had given me the DVD, I would be gracious enough not to complain about the previews. Why should I pay to watch their advertisements. (Yes, I have noticed I now pay to watch TV commercials) I am going to start returning DVD's with previews I can not fast forward through.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I'm so tired of the AROBTTH and X&Y comparisons because it's such a waste of time and energy. X&Y is better and I can say that without even having to think twice about it. I won't waste memory comparing SQUARE ONE to POLITIK because SQUARE ONE puts its predecessor to shame. Coldplay gets everything right the third time. All the Coldplay purists come on here to crap on X&Y because they think they've got it right. But they're wrong in so many different ways I can't name them all.

0060512806|4.0|I read this book after my first semester of college at the recommendation of several young male techno-geek friends of mine...no insult meant to them, I think they would have happily described themselves this way. This novel is rich in historical and technical detail--it's worth reading just as a crash-course in cryptography, information economy...and for that matter, scuba diving in underwater caves. Stephenson writes well and absorbingly--I truly enjoyed this book. My one real complaint about this book (and Stephenson's other books) is that they appeal to a sort of vindicating techno-geek fantasy--as I read Cryptonomicon I occasionally paused to question portions of the plot, and could only conclude that they had been included, not because they were necessary, but because they were \\"cool\\".  <br />Well, I'm female and could never muster the qualifications to be a techno-geek, so I expect that there are certain parts of these books that I will never identify with. Still, all in all, this book is very much worth a read.
B00097A5I6|5.0|First of all...i find it hard to believe that the reviewer that gave it only 1 stars is really an oasis fan... <br /> <br />That said..this is the best album they have done since 'morning glory'. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I think stand-out songs unclude Mucky Fingers, Love like a Bomb, and Part of the Queue.  <br /> <br />I bought this album and X&Y (Coldplay) the same weekend, and Don't believe the Truth is far superior. I'm going to see Oasis in concert next week and looking forward to hearing the new material.  <br /> <br />Cheers!
0316168815|5.0|I find it fascinating that many reviewers who have lived through the loss of a family member say this book has helped them through their healing.  I thought it was beautiful, but I would never presume that it could speak to everyone's experience, so I am delighted to hear that other people have felt it reached them.<br /><br />There's a mystery running along throughout the book--will Susie's murderer be captured?  I was worried that there was no way for the author to resolve that and satisfy the reader, Susie, and Susie's family, but Sebold certainly managed to deliver.  I also realized as the book progressed that that mystery wasn't necessarily the most important thing in the book.<br /><br />As soon as Susie was in heaven, she saw her parents' flaws.  As a child, I saw my parents as invincible and all-knowing.  It was eye-opening to see a child witnessing how much her parents didn't have it together, especially after their family trauma.<br /><br />Sebold's first person account of her rape and near-death experience, Lucky, is another excellent read.  I never would have thought someone could make that kind of experience readable, but Sebold is very talented, and she draws the reader in to the story of human triumph and love despite setbacks.
0060594888|5.0|Don't you want to go from where you are to where you want to be? I'm sure you do. I felt the same way UNTIL I read THE SUCCESS PRINCIPLES. Canfield is a powerful motivator and an inspiring penster. THE SUCCESS PRINCIPLES is (IMO) the BEST, most COMPREHENSIVE resource available today for success minded, goal oriented men and women (of all ages and professional levels and aspirations). As I read each page, I considered Jack Canfield my mentor and my \\"personal\\" coach in the game of life and success. I consider this my success bible along with my Bible-Bible. With the combination of inspiration from the two, I am doubly determined and empowered. I was born to win as are you. THE SUCCESS PRINCIPLES is exactly the book you need to remind you of your greatness and just how great of a life you were meant to live!<br /><br />Press THE SUCCESS PRINCIPLES into the palms of a college student, junior associate or professional at any level, in any industry and watch how their minds will expand as well as their opportunities.<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />Success is yours, you deserve it!<br /><br />Reviewed by Marina Woods, The GOOD GIRL Book Club, [...]
0786868694|3.0|I do agree with other reviewers that the photos in this book can be off-putting.  Many of the photos are extreme close-ups of the dishes, several of the photos are very blurry.  There are not that many recipes in this book I have wanted to try, but the ones I did were easy to make and turned out well.  In defense of the Coca Cola recipe- here in the south there is a great grilling marinade made from Coke, beer and Dale's seasoning.  However, I have not made her version of this.  The deep fried candy bars don't even sound appetizing.  There are really only about a handful of recipes that I will use from this book, but Nigella's writing style is entertaining enough to keep me fliping through the book.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I normally don't write bad reviews, but I am angry to be stuck with this new album. I have tried, but I can find no redeeming qualities to either of these CDs. I don't know how Foo Fighters could follow up a great album like One by One with such a repetive, non-melodic, badly produced group of songs. The songs all have too much base and sound muffled. There are few if any catchy melodies, and never throughout the whole songs. Then there's the copy protection. On mine, it appears on the acoustic CD. It is obnoxious and makes it diffiult to put songs my iPod or copy them to a mixed CD. Since I have no desire to listen to the songs again, am not trying too hard. I am a musician, so do not support stealing music; but if I want to copy a song from a CD I paid for onto a mixed CD or iPod, I should not have a problem doing it. This CD was a total disappointment.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|I had the first dvd of this movie and it was not in sourround sound so I bought this one.  You have to have sourround sound with that famous scene when the bridge blows up into pieces.  This is in the top ten westerbs of all time.  Sergio Leone is the king when it comes to directing a great spaghetti western.  I have all the man with no name series and am glad I have the last and best one now.  This had some pretty good special features and posters.  I like the special feature when they talk about the music in the movie.  Elli Wallach was funny and played a good part by being the ugly.  Lee Van Cleef turns bad in this film unlike when he was in For A Few Dollars More.  Clint Eastwood might not have much dialogue in this movie but he always lets his presence be known.  This movie really has good close up shots of the people's faces and that is what I like about some of the spaghetti westerns.  Great gun fights and just overall, a timeless classic.  Buy it western fans.  God bless you and have a great day.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies ever made. This movie is hilirious. A group of puppets fighting the war on terror against a puppet Kim Jong Il and some of the most wussy celebrities such as Michael Moore and Alec Baldwin. The movie has strong language which is not why it is funny and the greatest monlouge since the last time Chris Walken hosted SNL <br /> <br />Go right now to a place where videos are sold or rented and rent to buy it now!
B0000AMRJC|4.0|This is a very disturbing movie as we all so very know but it was a piece of art.  You have to really have guts to watch this film.  Al Pacino is the ultimate cuban gangster.  One thing about this movie that I think made it so famous was that it was the most violent film of all time.  Watch it once every five years because if you watch it a whole lot than that is not good for you.  This director sure did make a realistic disturbing classic.  Being a christian, this was difficult to sit hrough.  I do like the line where Al says \\" say hello to my little friend\\".  That is one of the greatest lines of all times.  Buy it only if you have the guts and stomach.  God bless you and America.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I think most of the reviewers were too hard core. This album, Mezmerize is great for quite a few reasons, and one of them is the fact that the FRONTMAN Serj let Malakian, who wrote many of the songs on the album, to also sing them. It's like if you created a time machine, wouldn't you want to be the first person to test it? Malakian had a spacific direction for the songs and Serj let him take it down the path that he wanted. The fact that you credit the \\"greatness\\" and \\"goldness\\" of a song or album to single person goes against what System Of A Down is about. But I do have to say I love the way Serj does a song. This Album, and all of the System Of A Down Albums are great because System Of A Down meshes and creates songs so well. Buy it, you won't be disapointed.
078322611X|5.0|This is a wonderful and heartwarming movie.  It will make every guy who's father died cry.  My father s still alive and I almost cryed because it is just one of those movies where a guy gets a tear in his eye.  Kevin Costner as we all know is the greatest actor to ever act like he was a baseball player.   Earl Lee Jones was a little funny and id good acting.  This might be a fantasy sports movie but it sure beats the Natural with Robert Redford.  There is a special feature on here called Father and Son that was cool.  Some Father son baseball moments are discussed by baseball players, the director,  and even Keven Costner.  I thought the newly discovered deleted scenes were good enough to be in the movie.  Every father and son should watch this together and this movie might even inspire fathers to spend more time with their son or daughter.  Amy Madigan was good as the wife of Ray Kinsella and I had only seen here in Uncle Buck before I saw this movie.  It did have some non fantasy moments like when Ray and the family were fixing to lose their farm because they had made the baseball field.  You people that love heart warming movies should buy it.  God bless you and America.

This makes his books very readable and enjoyable. <br /> <br />The trouble here comes when you wish to apply his theories.  The Tipping Point was filled with practical applications.  This book is a bit more of a stretch.  <br /> <br />The concept of the book is great.  The question is what can you do about it?  Companies such as ehuddle.com and others have been promoting tools to speed up the deceision-making process for some time now.  I wish the book would have had more real examples I can apply to my life. <br /> <br />Overall - a great summer read!
B00005PJ8O|2.0|George Scott is a good actor but did not portray Patton very well except in the profanity that Patton used.  I just feel that this movie did not capture enough of Patton's life.  They should have went through the years of his life step by step.  How did this thing ever win eight academy awards and win best picture for 1970.  One thing that was really dumb was that they showed the germans talking about Patton and that's all the germans do.  there was barely any war action it was a total waste of film.  I bought it because of what it said on the front cover- eight academy awards and best picture 1970.  What a joke.  One special feature that was put on here was an audio essay.  That was pretty interesting.  This movie also comes in 5.1 sourround sound and that's a good deal for a movie from 1970.  Please do not waste your money and buy this piece of junk in less you really really do like war movies.  God bless oyu and have a great day.
B0007ORU66|3.0|It looks like we need to enlighten those poor souls who thought that the \\"America only\\" albums released by Capitol and later Apple were true Beatle albums. <br /> <br />Now for the whole story.  The 1st Beatle album recorded (the Tony Sheridan and Star Club releases aside)and released on EMI records was PLEASE PLEASE ME.  The music was offered to EMI's cousin in the states, Capitol records, who refused to release it in the USA.  Enter Veejay records, whose releases, INTRODUCING THE BEATLES, BEATLES AND FRANK IFIELD ON STAGE, ETC. were all but lost on an unsuspecting American public. <br /> <br />By the time \\"Beatlemania\\" had hit the states in early 1964, the Beatles had already released yet another full album, WITH THE BEATLES, as well as several EP's (extended players)and were the stars of a little film known as A HARD DAYS NIGHT.  By that time VeeJay Records had gone bust, and Capitol jumped in to release all it could to the unsuspecting American public. <br /> <br />So, we have several Capitol releases that were put out to satisfy the (by that time) unsatiable hunger for anything Beatles in the states.  MEET THE BEATLES and THE BEATLES SECOND ALBUM were hastily released as USA-only albums.  Then, THE EARLY BEATLES came out to give us some of the stuff we missed off of the true 1st album PLEASE PLEASE ME.  To make matters worse, the Capitol albums only sported 12 cuts to the British EMI albums which usually had 14 cuts.  This state of affairs continued all the way up to the SERGEANT PEPPER release, giving us yet more product.  SOMETHING NEW, BEATLES 65, and YESTERDAY AND TODAY were all CAPITOL only USA releases that capitalized on the excess product.  I often wonder if the much sought after \\"Butcher album cover\\" on YESTERDAY AND TODAY was the Beatles having a go at the way that Capitol cut songs off of their albums to make more cash. <br /> <br />Oh well, that corporate greed gave us album collectors our \\"buried treasures\\" so to speak.  And so, the HEY JUDE CD offered here as an import on Asia records you see was a USA release with a bunch of tunes that were originally released as singles or B-sides. <br /> <br />Another interesting note is that MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR music was originally released in the UK as a double EP.  Capitol, ever finding ways to squeeze yet more out of us, duly added several more singles and B-sides to it(All YOu Need Is Love, Baby You're A Rich Man, Strawberry Fields, Penny Lane, etc.)and released it as a full album. <br /> <br />I won't go into the full story here, but the U.K. did release an album of \\"hits\\".  It was called A COLLECTION OF OLDIES BUT GOLDIES. <br /> <br />Most of the tunes on HEY JUDE can be found on the PAST MASTERS CD's (Volumes 1&2).

B00005JLEJ|4.0|Set during the 16th century when Warlords ruled Japan, \\"Kagemusha\\" focuses on the ruler Lord Shingen (Tatsuya Nakadai)leader of the Takeda clan who has held chaos and his enemies at bay for decades. His land is prosperous and doing well. When he's killed by a sniper, Shingen's brother proposes putting a double who has an uncanny resemblence to Shingen in the hopes of keeping the rival clans from invading and ousting the ruling Takeda clan out. He uses Shingen's last wish as his excuse to bring in this double a petty thief (Nakadai as well); Shingen insisted that no one be told of his death. Unfortunately, his enemeis do hear rumours of his death and they send spies in to confirm whether or not he is dead. Suddenly, the \\"shadow warrior\\" is thrust into the limelight and must lead the clan against their enemies.<br /><br /> A staggering and stunnning epic Kurosawa's film benefits from the fact that he painted and sketched out many of the major scenes for the film over a four year period while he waited for financing for this major project. A warning to those expecting a \\"Die Hard\\" style action film; the action set pieces are stunning and brilliantly realized as only Kurosawa could do but like many of his films Kurosawa let's the story unwind at a leisurely pace. The first hour sets up the final hour and forty minutes.<br /><br />Painstakingly remastered using a restored high definition digital transfer, \\"Kagemusha\\" hasn't looked this good since it was originally released and I doubt that many prints were as free of dirt and debris as this version which was run through a digital filter to clean it up. There's a fine audio commentary by Stephen Prince author of \\"The Warrior's Camera: The Cinema of Akira Kurosawa\\". Prince has some very interesting insights into Kurosawa's world and that of Japanese cinema. The subtitles are much improved and easier to read as well. There's also a 48 page book featuring paintings, sketches and an interview with Kurosawa around the time of this film's release from SIGHT & SOUND magazine. There's also an excerpt from a book by Japanese film historian Donald Richie and a new eassay by film scholar Peter Grilli discussing the film and the difficulty Kurosawa had in getting the film made.<br /><br />The second disc features a number of great extras. There's a brand new interview with Goerge Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola discussing how they got involved in financing Kurosawa's epic film. They basically got Fox involved as distributor and co-financer with Toho studios so that Kurosawa could get it made. Ironically, both met Kurosawa but found out that the director needed financing from a third party as the director didn't feel he knew them well enough to ask for their help. There's also a 40 minute documentary on the making of the film entitled \\"Akira Kurosawa: It Is Wonderful to Create\\". There's also a wonderful supplement that runs about 45 minutes using Kurosawa's original paintings, sketches and drawings reconstructing much of the film showing how closely the final film matched his original paintings. Finally we get the original teasers and trailer for the film (there are on the first disc) along with a comparison between storyboard and finished film sequences.<br /><br />Overall a first rate presentation from Criterion and well worth the investment. I'm looking forward to their eventual release of \\"Ran\\" Kurosawa's last epic masterpiece on DVD. Nobody could interpret Shakesphere as well as Kurosawa.of this film's release from SIGHT & SOUND magazine.

B0002KVUMK|2.0|This movie was OK, but not very good. There are too many special effects in this movie, and they take away the movie's realness. The script is campy with some of the stupidest lines i've ever heard in a Dracula movie, and the acting is laughably bad. Hugh Jackman should've ditched this movie, and the same for Kate Beckinsale. If you want to see a better film, go see Francis Ford Coppolas version of Dracula over this crap.
B00097A5I6|5.0|When I first listened to this CD (and I'm a huge Oasis fan) I didn't get it.  After 3 or 4 listens I couldn't stop listening.  What a great collection of songs.  If you're an Oasis fan you will love this album.  This is their Revolver and my second favorite Oasis Album.  I truly believe Oasis has many more great albums ahead of them.
B000006NUW|4.0|I can understand those who just don't want to listen to mono recordings.  Certainly, something is lost when you lose left-right soundstage.  However, in comparing the stereo and mono versions of the same song, the mono ones sparkle, while the stereo ones are often quite oddly balanced.  Many simply won't appreciate this difference, so they might prefer to get a CD with the stereo versions.  However, for musical power, these mono masters pack a punch and are a blast to listen to.  If you love the music and have an ear for the finer points of musical production, these are worth a good listen.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|I've been a Foo Fighter fan since their first CD and was looking forward to this double CD. It was well worth the wait - TRUST ME! I have no idea how anyone could give a low rating for this one. In Your Honor is chalk full of great songs - 20 to be exact. Most are of the high Foo Fighter quality that we have come to expect but that doesn't mean there aren't a few fillers. There are some, especially on the acoustic side. But even the fillers are not that bad. After listening to all the tracks for many days now, I would have liked to have seen the Foos put out a solid single CD (13-14 tracks)  that excluded a few of the repetitive sounding songs such as \\"Hell\\", \\"Free Me\\", and about half the acoustic stuff. Then we would have had the ultimate and definitive Foo Fighter CD. As it stands, it's still a very good listen, well beyond what some of these other reviewers have stated. In Your Honor is better than their last effort, Ony By One, but barely falls short of thier best CD, There Is Nothing Left To Lose, and that is only due to a handful of filler songs to fill a 20 track double CD. Highlights include \\"Resolve\\" (should be their next single!), \\"DOA\\", \\"Best of You\\", \\"In Your Honor\\", \\"On the Mend\\", \\"Miracle\\" and \\"Over and Out\\". Buy this CD now cause you won't be disappointed.
1592400876|5.0|Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation is a short nonfiction book written by Lynne Truss, the former host of the BBC's Cutting a Dash radio programme. <br /> <br />In this book, published in 2003, Truss details the state of punctuation in the United Kingdom and the United States and describes how rules are being relaxed in today's society. Her goal is to remind her readers of the importance of punctuation in the English language by mixing humour and instruction. Each chapter is devoted to at least one punctuation topic: apostrophes; commas; semicolons and colons; dashes; and hyphens. She touches on varied aspects of the history of punctuation, including many thoroughly-researched anecdotes, adding another dimension to her explanation of grammatical rules. In the book's final chapter, Truss explains the importance of maintaining punctuation rules and touches on the effects of e-mail and the Internet on punctuation. <br /> <br />The title of the book is dervied from a joke on bad punctuation: <br /> <br />A panda walks into a café. He orders a sandwich, eats it, then draws a gun and promptly proceeds to kill everyone with it.  <br />\\"Why?\\" asks the confused, surviving waiter amidst the carnage, as the panda makes towards the exit. The panda produces a badly punctuated wildlife manual and tosses it over his shoulder.  <br />\\"Well, I'm a panda,\\" he says at the door. \\"Look it up.\\"  <br />The waiter turns to the relevant entry and, sure enough, finds an explanation. \\"Panda. Large black-and-white bear-like mammal, native to China. Eats, shoots and leaves.\\"  <br /> <br />Irish author Frank McCourt, author of Angela's Ashes, wrote the foreword to the U.S. edition of Eats, Shoots & Leaves. In it, he praises Truss for bringing life back into the art of punctuation, starting off by stating, \\"If Lynne Truss were Catholic I'd nominate her for sainthood.\\" McCourt's tone is lighthearted, as is Truss's throughout the book. <br /> <br />In 2004, the U.S. edition became a New York Times bestseller. The book has become such a success that it now even has its own interactive punctuation website ([...] Contrary to usual publishing convention, the U.S. edition of the book left the original British conventions intact. <br /> <br />
0767817478|5.0|Okay, I know this is going to be a highly disputed opinion, but I think this movie is very, very good.  Great, I'd even daresay.  And I am a Godzilla fan.  I love the Big Guy from his early masterworks to his campy mid-period to his new thrilling outings. <br /> <br />Admittedly, this is not the same Godzilla.  But Godzilla himself is a product of the 50s fascination with giant monsters, and this movie is really just an homage to all those old, great monster movies.  Anyway, I don't see why the universe isn't big enough for two Godzillas. <br /> <br />A lot of fans hated this just for the idea.  But Tristar had to make a new version.  The old version would've flopped in America.  In fact, Godzilla 2000 came out about a year later, and it did terrible.  So where were those so-called fans when he really needed them?  I submit that there really aren't that many Godzilla fans.  There's plenty of people who claim to be, but do they really like him or these types of films?  Doesn't seem like it. <br /> <br />Onto the movie.  First there's Godzilla.  He's a terrific special effect.  Some people say he doesn't look real.  He looks pretty darn impressive to me.  Realism is a rather silly complaint when you're talking about a giant lizard running through New York. <br /> <br />The story is deceptively simple.  You could boil it down to Army vs. Monster, but there's a creativity here that gets overlooked.  The characters (all of whom are well-developed especially considering none are the real star) are all likable.  Their motivations are believable.  And their story arcs are solidly connected to the central conflict in a way that doesn't seem forced. <br /> <br />The action sequences are wonderful.  I like to think of them as monstrous versions of great kung fu showdowns.  Godzilla isn't invulnerable in this film, and so when he fights helicopters, rockets, and submarines, I actually felt suspense, even though I knew he wasn't going down until the end of the movie. <br /> <br/>The plot of Godzilla's young gives a nice excuse for some human-scaled action.  The pacing is expertly handled.  At two hours, there's still a lot crammed in here.  The acting is good.  Jean Reno's French military agent is beautifully understated.  And the final end of Godzilla is both tragic and satisfying. <br /> <br />I don't love the last little bit, but to me it's not so much an advertisement for a sequel as a wink to those \\"THE END?\\" titles at the end of those great old movies. <br /> <br />Boy, this is a long review.  I guess I'm just trying to make a case for this underrated and much-maligned film.  Personally, I think the original Big Guy would love it.  Although I'm sure his version would end a little different.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|you obviously dont know sh** about anything related with nirvana or foo fighters. kurt loved daves songs and had said that he wanted to use exausted and alone+easy target on the next album. and how can all the songs off the first album be a rip-off from nirvana, if you thought before you typed you could of known that all of the songs except for 2 had been written before dave was in nirvana!!    if you dont believe me then go to  [...] and go to the audio section. ass.    this album is fine the way it is. its a double album. what do u want? of course some songs will not be as good as the others. all of the songs DO sound different. this is a new step for the foo's. The stuff on the rock disc IS the hardest stuff theve ever done. easily, like most double albums this could have been cut down to 13 tracks and be the greatest foo fighter album. but, i think this album was necessary. if you liked the foos before youll still love them, maybe even more. most reviews on this page are crap.     this is for the ipod complaints  the offical directions to get it on your iPod       Your ticket 013304 has been Answered       Thank you for contacting us, ##CENSORED##.

B0006L16N8|4.0|This is a good album, and it will undoubtedly sell millions of copies.  Coldplay has a fun pop sound that feels tailor-made for listening with the top down on the way to the beach.  Having said that, \\"X&Y\\" for all its strengths lacks in the way of originality.  The album pays homage to Lennon and U2, which is cool, but I already have \\"Imagine\\" and \\"The Unforgettable Fire.\\"  Admittedly, what they've done here is very good, but all of it has been said and done before.  And I suppose that's okay.  Like Paul McCartney (a true original) said, \\"Some poeple want to fill the world with silly love songs.  And what's wrong with that?\\"
B00005JKWJ|3.0|Your rotten reviewer will keep things short, children. In case the title fooled ya, this is the sequel to Blade - with Mr. Wesley Snipes (after watching his killer moves in this flick, I can't bring myself to even talk about him without the most earnest deference).  The \\"Blade\\" movies are set in a fun-house mirror version of our own world, in which a race of supercharged vampires (appearing little different than the everyday corporate variety) use their superior powers and wealth to rise to the top of the food chain.  Reprising his role as a daywalker, a sort of a mutant hybrid of human and vampire, Snipes wars against the Vampires (whom he calls suckerheads). As we learnt in the first \\"Blade\\" flick, Blade has all the powers that come with being one of the undead (including a killer fashion sense and an attitude to match; also he's really quick with a samurai sword and can absorb punishment that would kill lesser comic-book heroes). For reasons that have beguiled the vampires, he has none of their weaknesses. Blade uses killer moves, a samurai sword that seems to have a mind of its own, various gadgets and his attitude. Having dispatched a would-be Vampire king in the first movie, Blade is offered a chance to join the suckerheads when a mutant race of vampires called Reapers sets its appetites on everybody. With sideways-opening mouths, super-speed and a heart almost completely encased in solid bone (my stake won't work! Would you believe that this has never happened to me before?), the Reapers stalk vampires much as vampires hunted humans. Against the advice of his friends (including Kris Kristofferson as a crusty mortal who's endured so much suffering, he might as well be one of the dead) Blade joins the suckerheads in annihilating the Reapers. Dangers aside, Blade reasons that the pact will allow him to get closer to the vampires than he's ever been able to before, and anyway, should the reapers nosh the vampires to extinction, they'll add the human race to theirmenu.  <br /> <br />So, why doesn't this movie completely rock? For one thing, it's so dark that it's hard to tell what's going on during the fast battle-scenes. Also, sexed-up for battle, our hero and his not-so-loyal band of undead foot-soldiers are encased in body-armor, armed to the teeth and shielded with their glasses - it's like watching a movie about action figures. The characters walk and talk like soulless AI characters in some hopped-up videogame. (Unfortunately, I caught this flick about the same time \\"Demolition Man\\" was on, and it was enlightening to see how much more spirited Mr. Snipes was Simon Phoenix in that flick.) Our badguys die in predictable and uninspiring CGI pyrotechnics, and speak either n a pastiche of four-letter words and pseudo-hard boiled tough speak (\\"yeah? Take off your sunglasses and say that, punk!\\"), or some of the overly dead-serious and clinically precise babble you'd find in either overpriced comics or on episodes of \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\".  \\"Blade II\\" is supposed to be about tough guys, but it's not very tough at all. If ever a movie needed the \\"Simon Phoenix\\" treatment, this is it.
1572814349|2.0|I had seen the Golden Tarot deck advertised here and there, and I had read the customer reviews in amazon.com.  I was impressed, and decided to order a deck right away.<br /><br />After I received the deck and did a few divinations with it, I felt humiliated that I had thrown away twenty-five dollars on it.<br /><br />The only positive thing I could say about the deck is that the guilt edges are quite handsome.<br /><br />On the minus side, however, I have several things to say.  First, U.S. Games always offers its books and decks either separately or as a set.  That way, when you wear out a deck or bend or lose a card and want to get a new deck, you can purchanse one without having to buy an entire book/deck set.  The Golden Tarot is an unfortunate exception to this.<br /><br />Second, the deck is almost impossible to shuffle.  The cards are just slightly larger than the standard Rider deck cards, making them just slightly more difficult to handle.  And, the cards are made of thick, stiff cardboard.  It is quite difficult bending back each half, and then trying to let the cards riffle cleanly off the thumbs.  Most often, the cards interleave in clumps, making thorough shuffling quite difficult.  The deck measures 1 1/8 inches thick, making it the thickest Tarot card deck in existence anywhere.  This unprecedented thickness just adds to the difficulty of handling it.<br /><br />I had previously heard about the magnificent artwork of the cards, and how the creator, Kat Black, had used numerous paintings of the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance periods to create nice montages whose images approximated traditional renderings.  The stiff cardboard that the cards are printed on, however, seem to be of a low-grade quality that creates low-contrast renderings of the original artwork.  The pictures on the cards, in other words, are dull and muted in their coloration.  There is no color saturation or aesthetic sparkle to any of them.  The colors are not vibrant at all, but tend to be monochromatic.<br /><br />I was also put off by Kat Black's comment in the Introduction portion of her instruction book that she personally uses the Tarot as a guide to \\"personal insight\\" rather than as a means of fortune-telling.  The implication is that fortune-telling is somehow beneath her, and that \\"personal insight\\" and fortune-telling are somehow two different things.  The vast majority of the people I do readings for ask me divinatory questions of the fortune-telling type.  And through these fortune-telling divinations, these people obtain valuable \\"personal insight\\" about their problems.  I find it both inexplicable and offensive that Kat Black tries to put down this most common and useful kind of divinatory questioning.<br /><br />I do not see how this Golden Tarot deck is going to stay in print very long.  No one but the most masochistic is going to want to try to shuffle the deck more than two or three times.  Then they will put it in their dresser drawer where it will stay forever.  Not too many people will want to admit they wasted twenty-five dollars on this deck, but I sure did.but tend to be monochromatic.<br /><br />I was also put off by Kat Black's comment in the Introduction portion of her instruction book that she personally uses the Tarot as a guide to \\"personal insight\\" rather than as a means of fortune-telling.

B0006L16N8|4.0|The album is fresh, some of the tunes are very catchy and, yes, like the previous two Coldplay albums, it grows on you over time.  What intrigues me about this album, however, is the amount of \\"borrowing\\" that goes on.  Some of it just knocks me over.  Does anyone else hear strains of Tom Petty's \\"I Want To Be King\\" in the 2nd cut, \\"What If?\\"?  How about some crooning from John Lennon's \\"Double Fantasy\\" album in \\"Fix Me\\"?  I could go on.  In fact, when time permits, I plan compile and post here a list of cross referenced \\"influences\\" on some of the songs in this album.  Those of you who saw VH-1 Storytellers know that Chris Martin is not shy about admitting Coldpay likes to borrow riffs, beats and whatever from other artists.  Perhaps this is the true meaning of the album's title, \\"X & Y\\" -- the \\"X\\" is Coldplay, and the \\"Y\\" is the \\"borrowed\\" material.  Therefore, X & Y = the album. QED[\\"quod erat demonstratum\\", or \\"there it is\\"] -- an appropriate coda for an album titled in tribute to an algebraic formulation.

B0007OCG4W|3.0|Mix match and swing into this confusion of relationship choices. \\"Closer (2005)\\" does nothing to answer any relationship questions, buy looks at dysfunctional people trying to and wasting other dysfunctional people's time.<br /><br />  \\"Closer (2005)\\" follows the relationship between four individuals: Natalie Portman (Alice), Jude Law (Dan), Julia Roberts (Anna) and Clive Owen (Larry).<br /><br />  Deceit is the main premise for this film.  Mike Nichols (Director) takes this all-star cast and turns them into faux characters. The film is time choppy and leaves the viewer to fill in the blanks. Once or twice works in a film, but not the whole film. It was like playing a crossword puzzle without rationale.<br /><br />  Half way through the film I asked myself, why am I still watching?  One reason; the well-known actors!  This film puts the Hollywood good girls Julia and Natalie into exasperated \\"dirty\\" talk that is uncomfortable to listen to.  At times it made me cringe. But acting puts them into \\"must see\\" situations.<br /><br />  Some people call it cutting-edge film making, artsy to others, but entertaining? It depends on the personality of the viewer.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|I purchased the album the first day it was out, and the first disc solidified that the Foo Fighters are a rock band that will stand the test of time.  From the opening cut \\"In Your Honor\\" to the final cut \\"End Over End\\", I was rocking out the entire time...I think that the best cut on the entire first CD is \\"DOA\\", it's vintage Foo and should definitely be a release.  The second CD took a little while to grow on me, because acoustic Foo isn't something I'm used to, but after a few plays I was into it as well....even if this album was released as the first CD and nothing else, it would definitely be one that I play in constant rotation.  Can't wait for the Foo Figthers/Weezer tour in the fall, I'll definitely be in the front row....hats off to Dave Grohl and the band for an incredible CD...it's rare that you can get an album nowadays that contains 50% great songs on the disc, and this one has 100% greatness all around. <br /> <br />As for the copy protection, it's only on Disc 2, and the easiest way to get around it is to rip the disc into a separate directory from disc 1 and retag the files since it names the files the same song names as disc 1 to overwrite what you've already ripped.  Easy workaround, didn't annoy a veteran mp3 ripper at all.
B000002JOH|5.0|Pantera is one of the best bands of all time (my second favorite, Coinmonster being first).  Dimebag was regarded during his life, and now after his death, as one of the greatest guitar players ever.  Vinnie is regarded as one of the best metal drummers ever. <br />This album is amazing.  You will not regret buying it.  This is not death metal or lame, 80's-sounding, worn-out crap.  This is simply heavy, heavy metal.
B00005JL0U|5.0|My son will soon turn 19 years old, and I was hoping to be able to get him a ticket \\"down memory lane\\", with this GREAT video; only to find out that it is not yet made in DVD format.  Let me tell you, when my son was 4 years old, I spent $22 for Michael Jackson's Moonwalker video, and up to this day, I still say that it was the best $22 I ever spent.  If he could have stayed awake 25 hours, 8 days a week, he would have watched it constantly.  And I got such joy watching him do his best to copy Michael's moves, even when he would repeatedly ask me (very nicely, mind you) \\"Mommy, can I watch Moonwalker again?\\"...and again, and again, and again.  I've signed up to get a notice when it comes out on DVD, and if it does, I'll be one of the first customers to order it, so he and I can watch it together and smile at the memories.  Thanks, Mike, for being a great entertainer.  We love you, in spite of it all.
B0006L16N8|4.0|I've been a fan of Coldplay since their stellar debut with Parachutes.  I had suspected back then that they could truly make a career of it, and I've been surprised, even stunned at how quickly they have realized these expectations.  The second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head, seemed to truly set Colplay on a path beyond indie, Brit curiosity--they seemed to have something to say about the world, about themselves, in the way that \\"great\\" accessible but significant bands like U2 often do (Coldplay's most commonly cited influence and point of measure).  Mixed with the dramatic political songs were those instantly addictive ballads that sent Coldplay into the rock band stratosphere.  They were BIG ballads, like \\"The Scientist\\", epic panoramas about the quietest and most intimate of personal feelings.   <br /> <br />This newest album has the band continuing to expand their talents for creating the \\"big\\" sound.  Of all the compliments I can give the album, it is this . . .  detractors can criticize all the naval-gazing . . . I'll agree that the grandeur of the songs spotlights a triteness lyrically . . . but the album musically, virtually every song here, every moment is so well-crafted that you can do nothing but admire the skill, thought, and time that has been put into the project.  Songs that at first seem to fly by you, upon repeated listenings provide wells and peaks of melodic beauty that are irresitable. <br /> <br />Listen to Martin's piano work on \\"The Hardest Part\\" as it breaks free of the artiness of \\"Clocks\\" and \\"Speed of Sound\\" into a jangly almost Elton John like spontaneity.  Melodically, I don't think Coldplay has ever been better than on this album.  Stand outs include the aforementioned \\"The Hardest Part,\\" \\"Talk,\\" \\"Swallowed in the Sea,\\" and \\"A Message\\".   <br /> <br />One of the most talked about songs on the album is \\"Fix You\\" and it is destined to become the sort of pop-culture juggernaut that was \\"The Scientist\\" and \\"Clocks\\", played on everything from MTV to movie soundtracks to Six Feet Under--you won't escape it.  There are moments on the song lyrically that are TOO simple, I'll grant.  I found myself wishing Martin had found another phrase here and there, but the cumulative effect of the gorgeous chorus, The Edge inspired guitar, and the four-part harmony is the sort of dramatic crescendo bands dream of--it is a song that has the power to stop you dead in your tracks--it is that good and that beautiful.   <br /> <br />There are 3 or 4 songs on the ablum I admittedly skip over now, but repeated listens have made all other songs on the album come to life.  This is NOT Coldplay's masterpiece and it is NO Joshua Tree.  Not yet, anyway.  Lyrically, they do need to take their eyes off the near and the minimal.  Certainly a band so technically gifted and so sincere in their lyrics, however trite, has other things to say?  But what this album does most assuredly is prove the band is here to stay, at least for those that have taken to its dreamy, mellow brand of pop-rock.  And the final cut on the album, a Johnny Cash cover, reveals the band is more versatile than they may realize.  It works.  They have miles and years to grow into their ridiculous talent, and I look forward to listening to it all.
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|System of a Down has to be one of the most talentless bands in the world. My buddies told me that this was the greatest cd that they ever heard, and said that it would change my whole prespective    <br />on the band. So i listend to like on song, and now i just hate the band worse than before. I can't believe this garbage, ohhhh they are so political, yeah  right, they are just copying other bands, very unoriginal.Alos i cant believe there will be another crappy album like this in a few moths. If i could give it a 0 i would.
B0002858YS|5.0|SO YEA, EVERYBODY HERE HAS SAID THEY MIX IN AN 80S SOUND...<br /><br />BUT, THEY NEGLECTED TO SAY THAT THERE WAS AN INDUSTRIAL FEEL TO THIS ALBUM...<br /><br />IT'S REALLY GOOD, THOUGH, EVERY SONG ON IT I LIKE, AGAIN, WHICH IS RARE...<br /><br />AND ITS UPBEAT, AS OPPOSED TO A LOT OF INDIE ROCK...<br /><br />BUY IT, IT'S WORTH THE $15...<br /><br />-CHRIS-
B0009HLDFU|3.0|I loved the CD, but i refuse to give it a 5 with the copy protection on there. Yea i eventually copied it, but it took way to longer than it should have. All i can say, if another Foo Fighter CD come out copy protected, they are losing a fan.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I have always been a fan of Michaels but I generally am not a CD buyer.  I was so outraged by his persecution and I felt so helpless, I did the only thing I could do to support Michael - purchase this incredible set.  I am so glad I did.  It's incredible and has every song I really wanted from Ben to Remember the Time.   I will cherish it.   Michael Jackson is American Royalty, a superstar with a heart as big as his fame - we can not let him fall.  Please buy this CD set.
B0001CNRSE|2.0|If 'Honey' is the first film you will ever see on DVD or in theatre, it will give you lots of fun -- chaming Jessica Alva and well-choreographed hip-hop dancing sequences, plus cameos of real-life musicians (among them, Missy Elliott is a standout). <br /> <br />'Honey' is not a bad film as some reviews might lead you to think.  What is really bad about the film is its awfully cliched story -- it is as if intentionally copying the old formula used in the Hollywood classics.   <br /> <br />The film stars Jessica Alva plays Honey Daniels, hip-hop teacher at community centre.  Her best friend says, as if pointing to the next chapter the film is going to show, that Honey deserves stardom better than anybody else, because, you know, Honey can really dance.  And, as it turns out, Honey is spotted by a top music video director Michael, and instantly hired by him. <br /> <br />[I HAVE SEEN THIS] It is kind of amazing that the script of 'Honey' offers absolutely nothing original in its all too predictable story.  What does happen next when the video director invites Honey to the party?  What is the solution of Honey who must save the community centre which is facing a finacial problem?  Even the kids on the street (including Lil' Romeo) go on the predictable course, and their descriptions are perfunctory at best. <br /> <br />The dancing scenes are good, however, and though I still don't know Jessica Alva can really act or not, she is certainly attractive enough to convince us that her heroine Honey could be an overnight sensation in the competitive music industry.   <br /> <br />Still, the film's story is so thin and predictable, like that of 'You Got Served.'  'Honey' is surely made with sincerity, I admit, and yes, I like Jessica Alva, but I really wish that such a good actor as Mekhi Phifer had done something better than providing a possible love interest, or I also wish that I could have seen David Moscow playing someone better than awfully stereotyped music video director.  Good dancing, it is true, but a good story also helps.
0060987464|4.0|Brian Warner (a.k.a. Marilyn Manson) saw more abuse, rejection, and misery in his childhood than most of us do in a lifetime.  He was rejected not only by the people who were supposed to love him the most (i.e., his parents and grandparents), but also by his teachers and classmates.  As he describes in disgusting detail, one of his grandfathers was a closet cross-dresser who liked to masturbate to bestiality and fetish pornography, and his grandmother would punish him and his cousin by making them kneel on a broomstick for up to an hour.  He was molested by a neighbor and emotionally neglected by his parents.  His efforts at fitting in at his Christian school were met with scolding and condemnation by his teachers.  And this was only the beginning... <br /> <br />In his high school and early college years he began experimenting with hallucinogenic drugs, the occult, and sadomasochism.  He realized (if not at the time, at least when he wrote the book) that something was wrong with what he was doing, but rather than get help, he perpetuated the same sorts of things that had been done to him.  As the fame of Marilyn Manson grew, so did the level of violence, destruction, and perversity inherent in his actions.  He and his friends physically, mentally, and/or sexually abused various people, including fans at their own concerts and even each other (chapters 8, 12 and 13 are particularly relevant here).    <br /> <br />Rather than being allowed to continue the abuse, he should be arrested and brought up on charges of assault and battery, attempted murder, hate crimes, illegal drug use, vandalism, and even \\"lesser\\" crimes like creating a public health hazard (e.g. filling a piata with entrails and placing a bat on the stage, knowing what his fans would do with it).  Since he exhibits strong symptoms of both narcissism and borderline personality disorder (e.g., self-mutilation, erratic and dangerous behavior, feelings of self-hate, disregard for the well-being of others, an inability to tolerate weakness or faults in others, etc.), part of his sentence should including spending a few years in intensive psychotherapy.  I'm assuming, of course, that the statute of limitations on these cases has not run out.  Either way, the bottom line is that Warner should be held accountable for and made to make reparations for the damage he's done to his victims. <br /> <br />In reading the book I tried hard to find something redeeming in how Warner's life is now versus what it was in the earlier days of Marilyn Manson, and there do seem to be a few hopeful points.  He seems to be using drugs a lot less, which is a good start, and apparently he's not acting out in destructive ways as much as he used to.  I was particularly hopeful in reading the last paragraph on page 242 and the next on page 243 where he writes things like, \\"As the drugs drained out of my system, humanity-tears, love, hate, self-respect, guilt-was rushing back to me...My apathy to the world had become a desire to save it.\\"  On the other hand, nowhere in the book does Warner express remorse for all his wrongdoing.  Where's the regret for having perpetuated and even magnified the type of abuse he experienced as a child?  Where's the evidence of a desire to help those who've been abused and neglected realize that they are valuable human beings worthy of being loved by others?   <br /> <br />People who know and accept themselves are able to admit when they're wrong, and they take responsibility for their actions.  Unfortunately, The Long Road Out of Hell shows far too little evidence of this being true of Marilyn Manson-at least not yet.  My hope is that someday Brian Warner and others who've been abused will realize that what they experienced growing up wasn't their fault, and that they are worth being cared about; that being beaten isn't a demonstration of love, and that being humiliated isn't the same thing as being appreciated by another.  I also hope that instead of perpetuating the cycle, they'll have the courage to get the help they need from people who will truly care about them.  Only then will they have begun to traverse the 'long road out of hell'.
B00097A5HW|1.0|This album is a complete disappointment to many Shakira fans, including me.  We expected something as good as Laundry Service, but were sadly disappointed.  Fijacion Oral is exactly that! An oral fixation of Shakira's tongue.  Most of the songs in this album sound sad and boring, there is no rhythm like in Whatever Whenever, or Objection, or Ojos Asi!. <br />There is NO WAY that she can make a tour for this CD, like she did for Laundry Service.  Most people i've talked to don't like the songs, except for La Tortura.  The CD will still sell because It's Shakira afterall, but it certainly will leave thousands of fans unsatisfied....

B00005JNJT|3.0|THE BEST BATMAN? R U SERIOUS? How quickly people forget the AMAZING and far better ORIGINAL BATMAN. Why was it better? Well for one there was a VILLAN! Not some lame ass who you don't see until the final act and all you get is one lame ass fight that you can't even tell what's going on. Look Memento is a great movie, but Nolan can't direct an action flick to save his life! They wasted the Scarecrow, and please the \\"Batman voice\\" soo lame! ooh I'm Batman I need to have a deep voice, please it sounded so bad. Oh and BTW the love story is terrible. Freeman and Kane are awsome oh so is Gary Oldman but geez they had a great thing in the scarecrow and they just threw him away. And the ending> Please. \\"Let's totally change what you know about batman and the fact that Jack Napier kills his parents. Thus Batman drops Napier in the Chemicals thus making the Joker, Thus pissing the Joker off making killing Batman the man who made him top bill.\\" You know that whole I made you, you made me thing. \\"Insted lets refrence to him at the end like an after thought with a Joker card. Like he's a Fricken' insurance salesman leaving his card.\\" Please, how do they explain his creation? Does he throw himself into the chemicals? Maybe I should after seeing this movie?  <br /> <br />The Burton movie got it right. Gotham is dark, Batman is dark. The people of Gotham fear Batman as much as the criminals. Batman does not drive a HUMMER! And when did he learn to fly? Anyway weak, weak, weak. People so easily forget. Well forget this one and rent the Original and see what a REAL Batman villan is like. Not some side show.
B00007KWHP|5.0|Dream ON...to the heart of the sunrise. The Earth registered at least a small tremor (picture on the album cover) when this was released. To me, this IS YES at their trippy, powerful best. This album has so much underlying creativity and power it can knock chunks out of your skull (like the planet on the album cover). O.K., it's hard not to gush over one of my desert island picks (and I do TRY to limit them - as an excercise in \\"limited\\" self-restraint), ahh hell, let's just call it MY FAVORITE ALBUM! Blues for Allah, Dark Side of the Moon, Electric Ladyland, Thick as a Brick, etc. are great examples of psychedelic prog rock (and also favorites), but this is in the Hall of Fame as well, to my ears.<br /><br />From the moment you here the swell of Roundabout rolling in ...CHING (harmonic)...to the final climactic Heart of the Sunrise bass thumper, YOU KNOW THIS IS SOLID GOLD! Each of the main songs have an epic feel that takes you on a \\"mind's eye\\" journey, the solo pieces carry you across a bridge between them. Each island (kind of like the Roger Dean artwork) is reached from a bridge and the construction is beautiful to behold musically. To me, this album flows nicely and I love it's over-all feel, probably more than any other YES album.<br /><br />South Side of the Sky is like a meaty adventure movie after the Cans and Brahms and We Have Heaven (hilarious and charming) cartoon break. That's how we liked entertainment back then (now all we get is endless commercialism). The \\"South Side\\" tale (sung so finely by Jon) of Antarctic discovery and tragedy is accompanied by Howe's blazing guitar and Bruford and Squire's heart-pounding, rollicking interplay...and did I mention Wakeman? This album shows why he was everyones fav keyboard guy back then (this song seems \\"from all of eternity\\" - really spacey).<br /><br />The schizoid but cool Five Per Cent for Nothing pops you back awake (started dreaming during that last one) for the next feature...Long Distance Runaround! Have you ever heard a crazier guitar creation in a rock song - didn't know guitar could have a Scottish Lilt! Great classic YES song...(so tight you can hardly separate the parallel note for note attacks)...fade away from that JAM (they get cookin') and Squire starts the concert favorite bass wah-wah lead (a first maybe) The Fish...Howe accomodates the fish's journey with \\"electric water\\" harmony and counterpoint that get's your head swimming to the depths...Then,...(cartoon break with everybody's favorite studious owl playing the sublime Mood for a Day)...you come upon the Heart of the Sunrise! My favorite piece in the whole YES repertoire perhaps, I just think of this song often when I think of YES, I may have been drawn to YES first by Roundabout, but this song sunk it's hook permanently. I rushed out and bought a bass (I already had a couple of guitars) when I was 15 partly as a result of my infatuation with that song.  Dreamer easy in the chair that really fits you...Dream on to the Heart of the sunrise (lose yourself on this wave and dream).<br /><br />THIS album is required listening - ignore at your peril! THANK YOU YES FOR THIS PIECE OF MAGIC!! P.S. I did get the great remastered version even though I have other copies (gave them to my kids), the extras are excellent additions, especially YES' powerful long version of the Simon & Garfunkel song America. Steve Howe stalks on guitar like terror...thank God he's on our side! The alternate Roundabout, pretty interesting, kind of brings you back to the round Earth's beginning.

B00004ZAV3|4.0|People who give 2 or 1 star to this CD are frustrated because a lot of songs are missing. OF COURSE ! This is not a anthology, it is a greatest hits album. So, it was made for people interested in listening a good playlist from The Beatles, not more. If you like every song from the band, buy all their CDs, masterpieces for sure.  <br /> <br />If you do not own anything from The Beatles, this is a really good choice, here is why : <br /> <br />- You will get 27 great songs for a ridiculous price, how about that ? For a few additional songs, you would have to pay at least double price. <br /> <br />- The playlist is good for this kind of album. Believe me, I know every single note from every song, I heard them dozen of times each. It is a very good compromise between rocks and slower piano songs. Of course, a lot of other songs are great, but they had to make a choice for one CD to be filled up. <br /> <br />- It is a good introduction for \\"newcomers\\". You will have a good preview of what the Beatles could do from the early days to 1970.  <br /> <br />- Sound quality is good, well remastered, and the CD is nearly full. <br /> <br />Enjoy !
B00007LTIB|5.0|Don't let a quiet moment in a song fool you, intense high vibration energy is coming your way on this fire-breathing dragon.  You may get the impression with Gates of Delirium (if listening for the first time) that a pleasant, long English folk-rock song is on it's way...Get ready to run!  The tension builds to all out sonic warfare in the middle...\\"As friction spans the spirits wrath ascending slowly to redeem\\"...Can prog rock get any better?  Many people can't take the avante-garde intensity of Relayer, or they warm up to it slowly.  This probably is the most aggressive outing from YES, which is a good thing I think - when \\"aggressive\\" equates to rivers of musical power (these guys are ON like never before) and lakes reflecting lands far away (in your minds eye - the music takes you there, picture: \\"Snakes are coiled upon the granite...horsemen ride into the west.  Moons are rising on the planet...where the worst must suffer like the rest\\".  \\"Truth conceals itself in error.  History reveals it's face: days of ecstasy and terror invent the future that invents the race\\".)  But, the aggression evolves to beauty just as you forgot to breath.  Gates does the tension & release thing so much you'll split into two.  After you pull yourself back together, better get breathin' because next up is Sound Chaser!  This has to be the most pounding, freaky Rock ensemble piece ever layed down, I haven't heard anything like it elsewhere, in any musical genre.  WOW, POWERFUL SONGS!  Singing doesn't dominate this album, but what vocals Jon does lay down are some of the best on any album to me.  Thankfully, there is a quiet song on the album - if you call that quiet...To Be Over just sounds that way in relation to what came before.  It is one of the more gentle moments, at least at first.  There is an intensity (remember, that YES kind) hiding underneath. You can always count on a YES song to take you on an interesting ride.  I guess To Be Over is Steve Howe's baby in a way and you can tell, it has his signature tightly-structured (not in a classical sense) guitar inspired layered genius everywhere.  It is a very beautiful piece!  Check out Howe's fantastic 2001 release Natural Timbre (all instrumental) to see his great remaking of it.  When I was a teen, I used to let my turntable just reload this album over and over, sometimes all night.  YES, IT'S THAT GOOD!  One of only a few that intrigued me that much.  If you can get in tune with this, it is a very special album.  This is prog-rock paradise!  The Extra Gates run-through on this great Remaster is so enjoyable...can I have ten more?

B0007Z4S4C|1.0|there is nothing about this cd i like.  i found 90% of it to be boring and repetative.  it all sounds the same.  i have read other reviews that said how different it was from \\"dreamland\\", but to me, i can't tell them apart.  i even listened to it all the way through 3 times.  if you're having trouble sleeping i highly recomend it.
B000000OE7|5.0|if this album was released in 1978 it would have been a disapointing album, that's the mistake that critics make when listening to made in heaven. boy, do i have a soft spot for this album, when i first bought this in 1995 i was hoping for another classic rock album like 'innuendo' but what i got was a very melodic easy sounding album. on first listen i was bit disapointed, but over time i would find the true charm of this great tribute to freddie mercury. as a queen fan, how can you not love songs like  the reflective 'a winter's tale' the last song freddie wrote, or 'mother love' the last vocal take from freddie. the title track is a powerfull power ballad, which originally was a freddie solo song, obviously fits the mood of this album perfectly. it's hard to consider this album as a all time classic, but what you have is a consistently solid album with no bad songs, also, while listening to this underated gem, think back to the glory days of the 70's, when queen were on top of the world, the big party band, when life was only a good time, oh, how times change.
B0002X314C|2.0|John Legend's stage name is such a fallacy. Legend is definitely not something I'd call him. He has a good voice, a few good songs on this CD and that's it. Musiq Soulchild is much better buy his albums and let's forget this \\"legend\\".

B0008ENHTE|5.0|In an interview with writer-director Lawrence Kasdan contained on the documentary included in this new package, Kasdan says \\"there's not an actor that's ever dreamed of being a movie star that hasn't studied Steve Mc Queen's performance in 'Bullitt' over and over again.....he makes the most mundane acts like getting out of a car seem cool....\\" <br /> <br />Any male, say between the ages of 18 and 40, who first saw 'Bullitt' in 1968 was somehow effected by McQueen's performance and the overall laconic hipness of the film. <br /> <br />I remember zipping out of the movie theater parking lot at breakneck speed and rushing to the nearest men's store to buy a trenchcoat. <br /> <br />It was also reported that after the film opened, a number of actual plainclothes cops began showing up for work in turtlenecks. <br /> <br />'Bullitt' is the quintissential movie star vehicle--the plot is muddled, the pacing at times is slow, the supporting performances, while good, are never quite fleshed out--but damn if McQueen's existential hip wattage doesn't shoulder the entire project singlehandedly--the man could do more with a glance than many actors with a half page of dialouge. <br /> <br />This new 2 disc edition includes: a newly remastered print that is far brighter and crisper than the initial DVD release; an interesting commentary by director Peter Yates; a wonderul full length documentary \\"The Essence of Cool\\" featuring Robert Culp, Eli Wallach, Robert Vaughn, Mc Queen's first wife who helped guide his career, actor and close friend Don Gordon as well as many great film clips and still photos. <br /> <br />Also included is a mini featurette \\"Steve Mc Queen's Committment To Reality\\" (also included in the originial DVD release) and a feature on film editing which has nothing to do with Mc Queen or \\"Bullitt\\" but who's to complain. <br /> <br />Steve Mc Queen like Hendrix, Joplin, Morrison, Marilyn et all is one of those pop culture icons that became larger than life through their untimely passings--but in the case of Steve Mc Queen as \\"Bullitt\\" the phrase 'larger than life' is no cliche. <br /> <br /> <br />

B00005JNJT|5.0|There's a constant debate, especially when it comes to superhero movies, if a certain screen adaptation of a character is the best depiction possible. The Batman movieverse is no different; with a majority of Michael Keaton supporters, a vocal minority of Val Kilmer supporters, and a two-bedroom condo of George Clooney supporters, the argument rages on. Keaton's reign on the throne of Batdom is about to come to a close with the emergence of Christian Bale in Batman Begins. Director Chris Nolan and his screenwriter David Goyer bring a gravitas to the franchise that never even existed in the darker Burton films. This is a film full of fleshed-out characters and an honest-to-god complex story, and the performers and technical crews have approached this material as if they were expecting major awards.  This isn't a film to chew popcorn and enjoy the cool action, but one that takes the Dark Knight serious on his own level and offers insights on his often frightening predicaments.  <br /> <br />Begins starts as super-rich Bruce Wayne ends his tour o' crime around the world in an Asian prison. Why would a billionaire want to get in the minds of criminals around the world, you ask? Because the murder of his parents left him confused about the nature of crime and justice, and he must know the truth. In prison he meets another justice fighter, Ducard (Liam Neeson), who offers to teach and train Bruce in the ways of fighting crime in an Academy in the mountains with his master Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe). Bruce accepts and trains there, until after a falling out with the more reactionary group, he returns to Gotham City to put an end to the crime and corruption that has plagued the city for years. With the help of his family's butler, Alfred (Michael Caine), and the mis-used head of applied science at Wayne Enterprises, Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), Bruce creates a symbol of justice that will strike fear in the hearts of criminals in a way no man could. He becomes Batman. And that is just the start of the movie. Later, Batman battles corporate greed in the form of the new head of Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earle (the always wonderful-to-see Rutger Hauer), mafia violence in the form of Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson), and a more mysterious presence in Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy), aka The Scarecrow. He is assisted in his fight by the few honest officials left in Gotham, District Attorney Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) and a cop who probably has lots of promotions on the horizon, Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman).  <br /> <br />The story of Batman Begins is packed to the brim with themes of fear, vengeance, corruption, and family and each is given a satisfying length to develop. Suffice to say, this is one rich comic book movie that will reward further viewings. It gives the best answer of any of the movies to the question of why Bruce Wayne dresses up like a bat to fight crime, while neatly juxtaposing Bruce's childhood phobia of bats to the real horror of seeing his parents murdered. Fear fills Begins from beginning to end. The fear Ducard teaches Bruce to impose on criminals to the fear the Scarecrow's poison gives to the people under it's influence. Nolan portrays this in great effect as many of the scenes are scarier than any horror film you'll see this year.  <br /> <br />Nolan's direction is receiving the most scrutiny in the area of the action sequences, which are deemed too choppy and not well-defined. NY Times film critic Manhola Dargis cites that Nolan's action should be like Fred Astaire's filmed dancing which I would agree with in a lot of cases but not with Batman Begins. The action is as it should be for Batman, dark and fast, theatrical but not flamboyant. Nolan's direction maximizes this effect without inducing headaches or motion sickness. <br /> <br />In the end, you have to ask yourself what makes the best superhero movie of all time \\"the best.\\" Is it honesty with it's characters? An honoring of a long and rich legacy? An actualstory that just isn't filler for elaborate action scenes? An ambition to be something more than what is the norm of the genre? If so, Batman Begins fits all these bills and starts some bill of its own. This is the sixth Batman movie (counting Mask of the Phantasm and not the Adam West cornfest), and they've just now got it completely right with Begins. I'm sure Batman Continues, but will he ever End?  <br /> <br />A  <br />

B0006L16N8|5.0|If you liked rush of blood to the head...you will not be disappointed with this album.  Rush of blood to the head hinged on the change of emotion from song to song.  This album subtly uses these switches but the same genre of beat and tone exist throughout most of the album.  Without listensing this may sound like a bad thing...but it is actually great.  Most groups cannot carry the same tone and beat throughout an album, but Coldplay has enough talent to pull it off well.  After hearing the first 30 s of the album after I had already heard speed of sound...I knew it was great.  I used to think Chris Martin carries this group...and well he is great...but teamwork is the name of the game and their work together is amazing.  It was well worth the release date getting pushed back.

B00005JNJT|4.0|I know you recent movie goers have just come out of the theatre recently. I did too. We're charged up but don't get out of control. Get a Bat-grip on yourself. The BEST Batman movie was the 1989 Tim Burton original. Batman Returns comes next and Batman Begins is somewhere around there. The Schumacher ones,while not being superb, still have their moments. <br /> <br />The Batsuit did make Bale look sometimes like FATman.  The Batarangs were rusty looking and not cool enough. I like the action sequences and how the story circled on fear.  The early training stuff seemed to go a little too fast.  <br /> <br />All in all, Batman Begins is a good movie. I just think people need to think twice before they label Bale better than Keaton. HEEEELLL NOO!!! :O
B0000214F0|4.0|Having heard so much about this movie, i decided to get myself a copy of Caligula. The first viewing was difficult due to unexpected placements of extremely graphic violence, torture and just disturbing scenes. Running 155 minutes it also seemed to drag at parts. The sex scenes were nothing special. All the women are incredibly hairy, this taking away from the erotic elements - I dont find hair jungles attractive. As for the plot it basically highlights the short 3 year reign of Caligula before his assination. The whole purpose of this film is showcase the sick and perverse acts he commited and encouraged during his ruling of Rome. If you like roman history and can sit through 2+ hours of perversions on screen, go ahead and see this now. If the idea of graphic violence and explicit sex scenes in one movie interests you, go ahead and see it also.
B000957O82|3.0|I enjoyed this movie, but it went on for about a half-hour too long.  All the stuff at the beginning was good: the conceit of Will Smith being a \\"dating consultant\\" who has the secrets of letting \\"any\\" guy get \\"any\\" girl he wants.  What is good about the film are the performances from Will Smith and - surprisingly - Kevin James.  Everyone can relate to that awkward feeling around someone you like, and how good it would be to have an expert coach you through it.  It was also cute how Will Smith, as the expert, looses his cool around the girl he likes. <br /> <br />Where the movie falls apart is when it gets into the standard cliches at the end.  Of course, Will Smith will meet an \\"evil\\" guy who will misrepresent him, and his girlfriend will get the wrong idea.  Couples will get together, break up, and magically reunite.  This is an OK rental, but I'd be mad if I saw it in theaters.  Not worth owning.
B00005JNJT|4.0|Behind the city lights exists a subterranean society where crime runs rampant.  Who better to rid this society from corruptness than a man in a suit of amour that resembles a bat-like figure?  BATMAN BEGINS has the similar dark and sinister quality as the first BATMAN film, but with much more violence.  For the premise of the film, it is twofold.  First, Bruce Wayne attempting to come to terms with his demons.  Second, fighting municipal and corporate bureaucracy that is tainting the waters of Gotham city.<br /><br />The highlight of the film shows how Bruce Wayne came to being the \\"Batman\\".  From his childhood recollection of falling into an empty well and encountering a flock of bats attacking him to escaping the fears of his past, Wayne seeks solace in an unidentified far away land that resembles a snow covered Shangri la Himalayan landscape where he trains amongst darkly clothed ninja warriors, which are led by Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) and Ra Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe).  Director, Chris Nolan, presents a somewhat ambiguous and sketchy depiction of Wayne's travel to the Far East.  However, Nolan cuts to the chase by with Wayne declaring his purpose in life is to serve justice and to conquer the Gotham underworld.  Some may consider the first hour of the film as sluggish, but it is the core of the film.  As a historical-side footnote, did the lower foundations of Wayne mansion, which later was converted to the bat cave, possibly serve as a passage to the Underground Railroad?  Ah, the fantasy of fiction.<br /><br />Nevertheless, BATMAN BEGINS carries its weight with a parade of well-established stars.  Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Michael Cane as Alfred the Butler, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox steal the show.  However, the romantic entanglement between Wayne and Rachel (Katie Holmes) appears in fragmented segments.  The most frightening scenes are captured by Dr. Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy)who sprays some pscyhologically brain-poisoning powder with a sandpeople looking mask that results in an extreme depiction of a hallucination gone bad.  Despite the defining moments, there are subtle moments in the film where Wayne still has not come to grips with the loss of his father, and continues to have flashbacks and the repetitious scene with his father's stethscope.  Could this suggest that he wanted to cure the ills of society as his father had done to cure his patients?<br /><br />BATMAN definitely delivers.  However, this is not a film that young audience members should see without an adult.  There is plenty of pop `em and sock `em scenes, but not without a tremendous array of explosive theatrics and cinematography that does at all resemble the old Saturday cartoons of yesterday.  So, if you're in a batty mood or would like to see the beginnings of a superhero, may Batman begin.oisoning powder with a sandpeople looking mask that results in an extreme depiction of a hallucination gone bad.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|I'm not a rabid Eagles fan, but who can deny the incredible collection of talent not to mention the natural chemistry they have in the studio and on stage?  These guys know how to put on a professional show, and this one is captured with terrific camera work and an awesome soundtrack.  If this DVD isn't a seat on the stage, it's the next best thing.  The song selection is robust, drawing from their solo efforts as well, and also includes a couple of James Gang tunes updated and made their own.  Their performance is effortless and flawless, quintessential Eagles from start to finish.  There are few surprises, but the musical detours they do indulge can be appreciated for that very reason.  I would mention, just as an observation, that the editorial review casually dismisses the absence of Don Felder. I take exception to that.  His replacement gets the job done with equal precision, but the little bit of playfulness shared by Don and Joe isn't there.  The concert doesn't suffer for it, but I like Don Felder.  His multi-faceted talent is missed by this fan.
B00063MBU8|2.0|This album has the most repetitive melodies ever. Even in their other album, No pads, No Helmets... Just Balls, the melodies are very similar. <br />The lyrics are very effusive and they aren't deep at all. It's probably best for pre-teens. <br />Nothing stood out to me on this album.
B00005JNJT|4.0|Batman Begins is a fitting title, a statement in itself, stamping an end to a saga that had lost its direction long ago.  <br />Gone are the cameo appearances, the paper thin plotlines and the one dimensional characters. It seems one comic book geek, Christopher Nolan, finally did what all arm-chair critics would never do. He got off his rear end and rewrote the whole thing. That alone is admirable.  <br /> <br />The first move by Nolan was to cast a handful of well established supporting actors. Liam Neeson as the alluring mentor and conflicted villain, Michael Caine the witty and loving Butler, a perceptive Morgan Freeman as the trusted scientist, the list goes on. Interestingly, the part of Batman went to a less familiar Christian Bale, however, this is one of Nolan's best decisions. In the past this role has gone to actors like George Clooney, making it hard to separate identities onscreen. This way Christian Bale is Batman and not vice versa, and the supporting actors are dispersed carefully within the plot as to not overshadow the hero himself.  <br /> <br />The second move by Nolan was to return to the roots of heroes\villains, explaining the essence of identities and characters. At first the flashbacks of Batman's childhood seem generic, but the progression of this story helps set stage to the action that follows. The action of man, whether hero or villain is less defined than most could understand. The birth of Batman is truly more intense that meets the eye, more philosophical than Hollywood would usually care to mention. It has captured a depth in comic books that is rarely celebrated by onscreen adaptations. It is a depth in story and character I would only expect in Japanese animations like Akira, Ghost in the Shell, and so forth. And inevitably when Batman fails to stop a villain on his first try (being set alight and gassed), it doesn't feel like a predictable build up of tension, rather a moment in which we understand his weakness and his flaws. Theworld of Batman is shaped by humans with a cause, not supermen with magical powers. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the movie has its flaws. The plot to save Gotham City plays second to the tension at hand, and the finale is somewhat an anticlimax to the concoction of identities that are born and interwoven. To save Gotham City was not high on my agenda to say the least. The action itself was awkwardly shot. Batman Begins is one of many recent releases of big-budget action movies that insist on close up cut scenes flickering at an indistinguishable rate. In the end all we see is hands jerking, heads turning, and the sound of `ching ching'. Is it cost saving, I don't know, but I would prefer a panned out view of all the butt kicking! Thankfully the childish one-liners (specially during the car scenes) were restrained just enough to prevent a `star wars' catastrophe. <br /> <br />I wouldn't go as far to say this movie is a classic, but I am hopeful this saga will resurrect a trend in story telling for our comic book heroes to come.  <br />
B0009HLDFU|4.0|first of all ive been waiting for this album forever.  when i first bought it i was a little disapointed with some of the tracks like in your honor.  it was full of this awesome drum beat and you think its going to lead up to something but it never ends and you just kind of lose the song.  in this album they took all of their music and just separated everything.  its a great idea but i didnt quite catch on to the quality of it at first as i caught on to The Colour and The Shape.  some how i couldnt stop listening to the cds though.  as i listened to it more and more the music seemed to get better except for a few songs. <br />       Disc 2 took all the greif and the mellowness of all the past cds and mixed them together it seemed.  none of the songs had the happy tone dave had in recent albums.  the foos were just experimenting though and thats what a lot of artists do.  one of my favorite tracks even though dave wasnt doing vocals was \\"cold day in the sun\\".  it was a nice switchup for taylor and dave and it sounded pretty good. <br />      Overall, In Your Honor is a good album which seems to be a little over done.  I think it will be something people 20 years from now will be talking about because of the bands instrumental ability.  everybody seemed to know what they were doing and they played really well.  if you dont like it at first give it another chance and really listen to the music.
B0006399FS|4.0|Hey, it ain't the Joshua Tree and it ain't Achtung Baby.  Hell, it ain't even Zooropa. <br /> <br />But, to release an album this good -- with music that has some relevance and depth and soul -- after 25 years says it all.  In my book, U2 is, after the Beatles, the greatest Rock and Roll Band in history. <br /> <br />For you Mick, Keith and the boys fans out there who will cast Stones at this assessment, when you look at what they were producing after 25 years, I got two words for you: \\"Dirty Work\\" <br /> <br />
B00005JNJT|4.0|With powerful direction, a mixture of elegant performances and a dash of just enough special effects, this truly is a beginning worth remembering. While some moments lead this viewer to think corn was about to be popped right off the ear, the action quickly deviates into a darker alley that allows one to savor the moment of a deep breath. No brightly light faces, no one-liners to dilute the plot, and a ensemble cast human enough to understand without gulping down soda in vile disgust. Hopefully if there are future cards to be laid, and the jester shows his hand, this darker franchise will continue to satisfy without sacrificing itself to mockery .
B0006L16N8|4.0|This album is somewhere in-between Parachutes and A Rush Of Blood To The Head.  Its good - its Coldplay.  It is not groundbreaking, but it is easy to listen to.  I enjoy the album.  It is laid back, I wish it were a bit more edgy, but really Coldplay is not edgy, so what would I want them to be when they are not?  But, overall this is a good, not great album.  JVD
B0009HLDFU|5.0|I have been a Foo Fighters fan since their self-titled album.  I would have to say that this album is substantially better than their previous album \\"One By One,\\" which was okay, but seemed too formulaic in it's track flow and musical variety.   <br /> <br />\\"In Your Honor\\" comes out swinging with it's dual-disc (and in my case, dual-disc AND dual-DVD) album. The format of the CD and DVD is that on one disc, their is a CD side while the other side is a DVD format. So there is a dual-sided CD and DVD disc for the first disc (the rock disc), and then there is a dual-sided CD and DVD disc for the second, acoustic disc.  Both discs are well-worth your money.  The rock CD is excellent, It's beginning \\"In Your Honor\\" is a great intro to the disc, and subsequent songs such as \\"Best of You\\", \\"DOA\\" and \\"The Last Song\\" would be worth the money even with the other six tracks absent.  While I wouldn't call it the Foo Fighter's \\"hardest\\" rock compilation, (I think that \\"The Colour and the Shape was their most hard-hitting of their albums with tracks like \\"Wind Up\\", \\"Monkey Wrench\\", \\"Enough Space\\" and \\"My Poor Brain.\\") the first disc definitely rocks hard and well.   <br /> <br />The second disc is the acoustic disc of the two.  This is the pinnacle of all the Foo Fighters albums.  This disc shows the Foo Fighter's superior musicality and taste for variety.  The guitar chords and vocals are well structured and flow well together.  The contributing artists, John Paul Jones, and Norah Jones, are well incorporated into the Foo Fighter's acousitic repertoire and  are welcome voices along with Grohl.   <br /> <br />The DVD features on the album are worth your money only if you're extremely interested in the \\"Making of an Album\\" documentary, which lasts for about 15 minutes.  I found the documentary to be funny and an interesting insight into the Foo Fighter's creative processes and changes that they're going through.  The other content on the DVD's are just the enhanced 5.1 versions of the songs, which don't sound any different UNLESS you have a 5.1 surround sound setup in your possession on either your home entertainment system or computer.  Some may debate over the worth of these DVD features to require a $5 to $10 price increase, as I found it to be a little over-rated.  <br /> <br />Overall, the album (both discs), flow excellently from track to track and their is a definite refined sound to the Foo Fighter's fifth album.  I don't know how they're going to top this album with their next album, but it seems as if Grohl, Hawkins, Shiflett, and Mendel are on the right track with this superb album.  If you're a Foo Fighter's fan, this album is a must-buy to round off your collection.  If you're new to the Foo Fighters, then this album is the album to get if you should only choose one.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|The only criticism I have for Trey Parker and Matt Stone is that they don't make movies often enough. Their blunt, in-your-face crudeness and blatant disregard for anything deemed sacred by the masses is priceless and they don't fail to deliver in Team America: World Police.<br /><br />The songs in the movie are pure genius. I about fell off my chair during the \\"Everybody Has AIDS\\" Broadway number and Kim Jong Il's \\"I'm So Ronrey\\" is funny and almost downright adorable.<br /><br />The DVD of Team America: World Police is packed with lots of goodies. The behind-the-scenes extras are informative and really show you the time, effort and imagination that goes into creating a marionette movie.<br /><br />Team America: World Police delivers foul language, puppet vomit (an overkill of puppet vomit, I might add), gory puppet violence, wicked crazy puppet sex and a puppet Michael Moore. What more could you ask for?
B00005JNJT|5.0|Finally, a stylish and intelligent Batman movie that I found engrossing from beginning to end.  Played straight by a superb cast, Christopher Nolan's smart take on the Dark Knight was beautifully rendered by all concerned.  A wonderful noir look to the film that did not rely on full-frontal CGI, this Batman avoided winking at the audience or mocking its own characters. <br /> <br />Nearly a full third of the movie gives us a deeper background to the troubled hero, and his lost seven years of self-discovery.  I found every aspect of the film smart, well-thought-out,  and as logical as something like this could be. The dialogue worked for me, and the characters, played by this dream cast, had some depth and complexity.  And finally, the action was terrific.  This Batman attacks from and retreats back into darkness.  And darkness is the theme. <br /> <br />I often find amusing the complaints of people about a film like this.  If you want Shakespeare, go see Shakespeare.  If you want a comic book, read a comic book.  This is high class, highly intelligent movie making, done with style and panache and enough substance to satisfy most of us.  And it is great good fun.
B00014TJ6Q|5.0|This fine collection is a reflection of George's life.  By 1979, when he released this work, he appeared to be in high stride, not only with a successful film production company but also following his musical muse.  His son was born August 1, 1978 and the song \\"Blow Away\\" is a nod to Dhani's birth.  George was saying that the dark clouds of a rocky past had blown away and he was moving forward with hope and renewed vigor.  During the seventies, music to a large extent was commerical and in some cases cliche, but Harrison's work remained unique and distinct.  On this collection, he shows his myriad of styles.<br /><br />\\"Love Comes to Everyone\\" is one of the most beautiful and optimistic songs I have ever heard.  He could not have picked a better song to kick this gem off.  \\"Not Guilty\\" has an interesting history.  A decade earlier, George tried unsuccessfully to have it included on the White Album.  His original rendition of the song can be found on the Beatles' Anthology 3.  It's a shame it wasn't included on the White Album as this song is of extraordinary caliber.<br /><br />This collection is definitely worth owning.  \\"Here Comes the Moon,\\" a sequel to his 1969 blockbuster \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" is a cute, up-tempo song that will undoubtedly bring smiles to many faces.  \\"Soft-Hearted Hana\\" is a very gentle piece and is ideal for soothing away stress.  It is a unique song with the brand of guitar playing Harrison made his own.<br /><br />\\"Faster\\" is a fun, danceable song that is a nod to George's love for race cars - Forumla One.  George even admitted in his book, \\"I Me Mine\\" that he never got over his love for fast vehicles and this fun song reflects that.<br /><br />His beautiful song to his wife Olivia, \\"Dark Sweet Lady\\" is intensely beautiful.  So are the intensely soothing \\"Your Love is Forever,\\" \\"Soft Touch,\\" \\"If You Believe\\" and the closing track, \\"Here Comes the Moon.\\"  Closing with that one \\"aligns\\" this collection neatly and nicely.  While I would much rather Harrison had released a never-released song instead, I was not disappointed with this choice.<br /><br />This is ideal for the inveterate George Harrison fans and people who just like his music.  For those who are just becoming familiar with his work, you might want to start with \\"All Things Must Pass.\\"  That is an INTENSE Harrison experience!e I would much rather Harrison had released a never-released song instead, I was not disappointed with this choice. <br /> <br />This is ideal for the inveterate George Harrison fans and people who just like his music.

B0009HLDFU|5.0|I enjoyed listening to the album on their preview on my space last week. Putting aside the fact that Dave Grohl is incredibly cool and a musically fun person to be in to, this album is the Foo Fighters BEST work yet. Plus I really enjoy the 2nd CD of mellower songs too.  <br /> <br />IF YOU DON'T HAVE THIS ALBUM YET - BUT IT! It's a MUST have in anyone's music collection.
1559408855|2.0|I'd read alot about Salo before watching it. Every review I'd read proclaimed that it was very profound and that it was the most disturbing film ever made and such. Well, of course you can't rent it anywhere (especially not here in Fairbanks, Alaska), so I had to buy it. While I was watching it, all I could think was \\"Will that darn lady ever shut up?\\" The woman who talks to the kids for most of the movie annoyed the heck out of me. I was bored to tears. I kept waiting for something to happen. The theme of fascism is not completely lost on me, however. When it came time for the infamous \\"feces buffet,\\" it's not depicted very grapically so it wasn't very shocking. The violence in the film is mostly shown at a distance, so the viewer is removed from it. Maybe I missed something, but this movie did not shock, disturb or even interest me in the slightest. Maybe I'm just too jaded.
B0007OASII|5.0|This is certainly a great musical work- in all aspects- musical arrangement, epical., rhapsodic, melodic, powerful, symphonic and never tiring-It really has it all- starting with main title- March of Mephisto. real strong and spine chilling- transports me back to the past somehow! (As I love epic metal and celtic traditional music I make my personal associations of both) that marching sound- really dominaiting. Great - not to mention Khan's powerful and versatile voice. Abandoned is another theme I Iike- really beautifully sad. --- This album exceeds Epica- that means progress. Wish they could play live in Portugal--It sounds unprobable, but anyway we never know!
B000002UCQ|5.0|George Harrison was a musical purist.  He shaped his music around his beliefs and he never compromised his talents; standards or beliefs for anyone.  When this musical masterpiece was released in 1970, the Beatles had by then dissolved and gone their separate ways.  John Lennon was going through some rather \\"experimental\\" styles of music; Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr concentrating on their musical careers without letting their Beatle legacy overshadow their solo works, George Harrison was simply doing what he did best.  He was creating music that was not commercial and with deep, profound and very intense lyrics.  \\"My Sweet Lord,\\" \\"Hear Me Lord\\" and \\"Awaiting on You All\\" are the songs that carry the most trenchant spiritual themes and messages.  In this work, Harrison provides the world with his voice, which he did not get to do nearly as much when he was with the Beatles.<br /><br />The songs are intensely soothing; Harrison's voice, while deep is resonant and rich with melodic talent.  This collection shows Harrison's profundity; the many facets, the many sides of the one known as the Quiet Beatle runs an incredible musical gamut.  \\"Wah-Wah\\" was his cynical and somewhat cryptic dig at former bandmate Paul McCartney.  \\"Apple Scruffs,\\" which was a nod to the female fans who eagerly awaited a glimpse of any Beatle shows George's light-hearted side whereas the majority of songs on this collection show his intensity.<br /><br />\\"What is Life\\" is a delightful, cheery and seemingly soul-searching piece.  \\"I'd Have You Anytime\\" and \\"Isn't It a Pity\\" seem to be almost obverse sides of the same issue.  Both songs reflect a somewhat somber Harrison and the lyrics are nonpareil.  This is truly one of the greatest musical collections of all times.  This collection will certainly be enjoyed for time immemorial.
1573223026|2.0|While there were some funny moments and a couple of thoughts worth pondering, I kept reading hoping that by the end of the novel I would \\"get\\" why so many readers are raving about it - but it never happened for me.  <br /> <br />The only plot the book seemed to have ended in the first 20 pages or so and the rest was predictable and yet totally unbelievable. The characters were hard to like. It just was \\"eh\\" for me.
B000068G9X|5.0|I'm just going to get this out of the way because it really frustrates me when they do this.  I understand that Danzig's dark and evil music has never gone too well with concerned and controlling parents, but there are absolutely NO swear words to be found on this album - none at all.  The reason this bugs me is that I have heard so many records in which cuss words dominate the bulk of the lyrics (i.e. Sepultura's Roots) and yet no Parental Advisory sticker is to be found on the inlay booklet.  This tells me that the music advisory board is not doing a very good job of determining what is and what isn't appropriate for certain age levels.  On another topic, I love this album.   <br /> <br />Danzig (former member of the Misfits and Samhain) premiered in 1988 with this excellent masterpiece, the self-titled debut.  Spawning the hit single \\"Mother\\", the album went to sell millions of copies worldwide (particularly after the live single of \\"Mother\\" was released in 1993).  Offering a hard Sabbath-esque metal sound, with the sludgy, gritty pre-Nirvana stoner rock of the time, Danzig would go on to become quite a legend in the world of metal (being one of the headliners of the very first Ozzfest), and gained a large cult following with this release alone.  Songs like \\"Twist of Cain\\" and personal favorite \\"Soul on Fire\\" display brooding lyrics and questionable imagery.  Glenn Danzig's vocals, resembling a \\"metallized\\" Elvis Presley, are very catchy - probably the best vocals of this sub-genre next to the Ozzman himself.  Pounding drums, sludgy riffs and groovy bass all come in to complement - but Danzig's soloing is where the music truly shines.   <br /> <br />Following the Cure and the Sisters of Mercy, Danzig truly revolutionized the gothic music scene.  If you want to hear the archetype that would determine the sound of bands like Type O Negative and Love Like Blood, look no further. <br /> <br />10/10
B0006L16N8|1.0|Loved Parachutes, loved Rush. Got this as soon as it hit the stores...never heard Speed Of Sound or anything prior to the release. Absolutely disappointed!!!  <br /> <br />Their trademark Brit sound is now slagged off for something which comes across as \\"commercial sounds\\" jumbled with \\"A-Sure-Fire Hit across the Atlantic US-type mumbo jumbo rock\\". In tryin to do well in the US, Coldplay has lost their British sounding roots. This is definitely a disastrous record.
B000001ESP|5.0|50 CENT BETTER THAN RUSH?!?!?!?!?!?!?! ROTFLMMFAO!!!!!!! Have you seriously listened to this? Neil Peart is often called the best drumemr of all time, and that's an appropriate title. Geddy Lee certainly might not have the best singing voice, but his bass-lines are UNREAL!!! Also Alex Lifeson is a good guitarist, he can beat that loserAvril with his eyes closed! You say 50C writes good lyrics.......\\"Shake that a$$ girl, shake that a$$\\". Yeah, those lyrics changed my life! NEVER have I heard such poetry!!! (sarcasm) Seriously, go back to jacking off to pics of Avril while we REAL music fans enjoy an album by REAL talented musicians.<br /><br />With that out of the way, i will now go into the album. This is my first Rush album and it's a good place to start. Alex Lifeosn, Geddy Lee, and of course Neil Peart produced a masterpiece. I just wish that there was the drum solo in YYZ here like Neil does live. Other than that, this album is PERFECT. You should also buy this because they influenced the bets prog. rock/metal band ever, Dream Theater.<br /><br />Pete's ratings:<br /><br />1. Tom Sawyer(5/5)<br /><br />2. Red Barchetta(5/5)<br /><br />3. YYZ(5/5)<br /><br />4. Limelight(5/5)<br /><br />5. The Camera Eye(5/5)<br /><br />6. Witch Hunt(5/5)<br /><br />7. Vital Signs(5/5)
B00005JNJT|5.0|I'll tell you right now.  I have always HATED Batman.  This movie changed it all.  The story is gripping and the action is intense.  There are some sad and scary elements in there as well.  If you're a fan of Batman, you've got to see it.  If you're not a fan, you'll probably enjoy it anyway.  5 stars, 2 thumbs way up and highest recommendations.
B00003CX9E|5.0|I first saw this film when I was 15 and while I liked it I just didn't understand why a lot of critics said this was the best film ever done. <br /> <br />Now I'm 23 and after seeing this film 5+ times, reading about it and watching a couple of documentaries about the person in which Kane was based I can tell you that this film is not overrated. <br /> <br />It's difficult to say if this is the best film ever made, at the end it's a matter of tastes. The best thing I can tell you is this: Don't see this movie trying to understand why it's considered the best of all time, because you won't enjoy it. Just sit down and watch a movie about what we lost on our childhood and how we try to replace it with money, power and women.
B000002KAT|5.0|this is , for me, the most exciting cd of the all popular music . i love this.romantic, mystic and impressonist poetic. <br />the voice of van...the trance sensations in the songs, beautiful. <br /> <br />
B00005JNJT|5.0|FINALLY! I had to get that out after watching two pieces of crap that called themselves Batman. Joel Schumacher's reign of terror is over and Christopher Nole has taken the helm of the Dark Knight's latest project, Batman Begins. A tremendous improvement (how could it be worse than Jim Carry stealing the scenes or George in a nippled Batsuit?) over the last two and even grabs some ground from the gothic creations of Tim Burton, the original Batman and Batman Returns.  <br /> <br />This story, like everyone knows, tells how Bruce Wayne went from the orphened son of a multi-billionare to the Dark Knight, avenging his parent's deaths and fighting crime in Gotham City. It begins in the Far East where Bruce learns how to disappear into the night and fight his enemies. While CNN found this a stupid beginning and too \\"Asian-martial artsy\\", I thought there was no better place to begin. I mean, Batman's entire technique is the night, a concept used by those steathy assassin/spies called ninjas. Also, you can't expect Batman to take boxing lessons to beat people up; no, you've gotta go martial arts for that. <br /> <br />Moving along, Bruce returns to Gotham, transformed from a Corescant-like wonder of dazzling heights and glimmer into a dark, Blade Runner-like LA, topped off with a island housing the poor, criminally insane, and modeled after a destroyed Hong Kong slum. In Gotham, we get the beginnings of Batman from Lucius Fox, a former board member of Wayne Enterprises played by Morgan Freeman, and the butler Alfred, played by the wonderfully English Michael Caine. However, Batman will find his troubles in the psychologically minipulative Dr. Crane, played by sinister Cillian Murphy, also known as The Scarecrow for the mask he wears. Crane uses a hallucinogen that induces horrifying day-mares which render the victim helpless in their own fear.  <br /> <br />Speaking of fear, this movie uses psychological fear to a greater extent than any superhero movie, actually more thanmost movies, I've ever seen. The Scarecrow isn't really scary (well, maybe the mask is a little odd, possibly frightening to younger audiences), but he doesn't need to be psychotic or powerful to induce fear, he uses your own. Bruce's own fears of the past (not to mention guilt over his parents' deaths) provide a much more humane look at a superhero, like that of Spiderman 2. You feel Bruce is human, rather than just a symbol, as he attempts to be as Batman. <br /> <br />Overall, this film plays much better than the last two, possibly all, of the Batman's before. The cast is excellent (never seen one better for superhero films), the dialogue is witty (unlike the final Star Wars movie), and the plot is a great start to the Batman canon. The end leaves us with Batman, the new vigilante of Gotham, ready to take on the crime of the city, one villian at a time (and ready to find the REAL murderer of his parents, the Joker, who leaves his trademark card at the end).
B0009I7NNA|4.0|They're certainly getting a lot more attention now that they're inked with Warner. I've seen them on the covers on a few magazines, with big interviews in others. I honestly don't think they've sold out, they're just trying to get their music to the masses. <br /> <br />As for the title of this review, i think punk/hardcore fans will be more into this than metal fans. The vocals feel like the punk audience would be more into nowadays. Shadows's surgery has defintely set his singing back a great deal, but he's trying and you can tell. I bet by the next CD he'll sound better. <br /> <br />The music on this CD is great. They haven't missed a step. Very melodical, much moreso than previous Avenged CDs. I do miss the thrash they'd throw in occasionally, and i also miss some of Shadows' growls, but this is defintely a more grown-up sound. I read in Revolver that Shadows didn't want to lumped in with the metalcore bands that are out nowadays, which is probably a good idea considering 9 out of 10 of them suck. <br /> <br />The songs are usually hit or miss. I really want to like \\"The Beast and the Harlot\\", but the chorus keeps me from doing so. \\"Bat Country\\" is very good, very crunchy, and very catchy. I hope they use that as a single. \\"Seize the Day\\" seems to be a love or hate it song, but personally i enjoy it a great deal. Piano driven ballads always get my attention. Some of the other songs, like \\"Blinded in Chains\\" and \\"Sidewinder\\" failed to impress me. \\"Strength of the World\\" was flat out annoying when the chorus kicked in. But that's just my opinion. <br /> <br />Ultimately, this CD isn't Avenged's strongest. I honestly like the change to 99% singing vocals, but i feel like some of the songs aren't up to par. Like i said earlier, i think punk fans might find more to like on this CD than metal fans, but still it's a lot better than most of the crap on the radio. Waking the Fallen fans will probably be a bit disapointed, but it's still good, just not a masterpiece.
B0007TKNCY|5.0|I'm prejudiced because this is my all-time favorite screwball comedy and it might just be my favorite comedy of all time.  To watch the purely gorgeous and suave Cary Grant play an absent-minded professor complete with glasses and dinosaur bone and to see him caught up in this insane adventure with the free-spirited and looney Katherine Hepburn is a treat not to be missed.  I've been anticipating the DVD special edition even though expanded editions of classic movies can sometimes be a disappointment.  I haven't seen all the features on disk two but can comment on the commentary of Peter Bogdonavich.  I enjoyed it because of his obvious love of the movie and I liked that he enjoys watching it as much as I do.  He also quotes extensively from an interview he did with Howard Hawks and a lot of what he shares is fairly enlightening.  DVD's of classic movies just don't have great commentary because everyone associated with the picture is, well, either dead or greatly infirm so Bogdonavich's is decent and better than most.   So to fans of Hepburn, Grant or just brilliant comedy in general, I can heartily recommend this DVD edition.  It's such a cliche but they really do not make movies like this anymore.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|This is an amazing album! Every song is a genious. This is my favorite CD to listen to in the car along with Love over Gold. <br /> <br />I outlined all the songs on this great rock album. <br /> <br />1. Tunnel of Love 5/5 This is my favorite song on the album!  <br />I think Mark Knopfler does this song very well and I think this <br />is a track I can listen to over and over again. But it would be <br />better as if it was an album closer. <br /> <br />2. Romeo and Juliet 4/5 This is one of the most popular DS songs <br />of all time! It is great but not so great!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />3. Skateaway 5/5 One of my favorites on this album! This track <br />has a slow start to it. It is a radio classic and the vocals in <br />this is a classic. Anyway, I love the ending to this song. <br /> <br />4. Expresso Love 5/5 It is a great lovesong! Again it gains to <br />be a 5. The whole song is cool. One of my favorites. <br /> <br />5. Hand in Hand 4/5 This track is strong, but not my all time <br />favorite on this album. <br /> <br />6. Solid Rock 5/5 One of my favorites on this disc. This track <br />has funny vocals in it. The end will say, Im gonna live on a soliiiiiiiid rock!! Great song from beginning to end. <br /> <br />7. Les Boys 5/5 I like this track along with the 5. This is a good song, it makes you laugh, you may want to play it over and <br />over again, and I like how they say, \\"Les boys do caberet\\" I say <br />that a lot. It has never been a dumb song, it is a great song! <br /> <br />Buy this album, Love over Gold is a great matchup.
0440418569|3.0|Before I review a product on Amazon (especially one with a base of people who love it and another which hates it), I always take a look at what the people who hated it said. Before even starting to read the first review under \\"Lowest Rated Reviews\\", I knew that religion would come in somewhere. I'm going to try and set a few things straight.     Firstly, this story began in a world where the Church controlled EVERYTHING. They were talking of reviving the Office in Inquisition in \\"Northern Lights\\" (aka \\"The Amber Spyglass\\"), which, in case anyone doesn't know, tortured people who made scientific or philisophical breakthroughs, calling them heretics and eventually witchs, before having them burned. Now, we can already tell these Christians aren't that nice: they like to sever the link between themselves and their emotional manifestations (dmon). Talk about sick, but they even try to halt the advances of science (something which mirrors our own world; contraception, stem cells, anyone?) but everyone who reviews this book negatively says Philip Pullman is leading them into Satanism. Wrong. He doesn't support the \\"devil\\" in this book at all; what he's against is the evils of a theocratic government.    Now, since I've attempted to clear Philip's name, I'll switch topic. I believed this book was weakest in its telling, especially due to the overlong, depressing treck into the Land of the Dead. I just felt so sick and disgusted at the descriptions I found myself wishing to skip a couple chapters (which I didn't). It did show why Lyra wanted to free all the dead (and it further gave reason to why Lord Asriel is trying to kill God). But after the Land of the Dead sequence, I found the story much more enjoyable, although disjointed overall.  The final movement of the story, which I will not reveal, leads to an ending many said was easy to spot from afar and sappy. Hey, maybe I'm not good at predicting what happens in books, but I don't want to either. I just like reading andfinding out as the characters do. As for sappy, hey, everything can't be perfect in a guy's writing.    Overall, a scattered beginning, a depressing middle, disjointed action, but an emotional ending (I don't care whether you saw it coming) which redeems this finale to a lovely trilogy. And once again, it doesn't support Satanism, and it's talking about child-murdering, ultra-conservative church members so they don't deserve sympathy.   Also, commenting on E. Wright's refusal to accept the similarities between fundamental Islamics and conservative Christians, I'd like to say a few words. Firstly, yeah, they are alike: both are very far in one direction on the political spectrum, they both have a great desire to change policies in their country(ies) to fit their beliefs, and they also like to shoot down (verbally or physically) their opponents who try to stop them. They may not strap bombs to little children, but the religious right still has a little molestation scandel to deal with...
B00004Y6NX|5.0|This is my favorite album by Love over Gold! My favorites would <br />be Les Boys, Tunnel of Love, Skateaway, Expresso Love, Solid Rock. Les Boys is the best song on the CD and is a track that you <br />can play over n over again! Tunnel of Love is the same too. Skateaway is great. SOlllid rock is so graet! BUY THIS ALBUM AND <br />LISTEN TO LES BOYS.
B000002IST|5.0|It's said that good things can never last.  Genesis reeled off one brilliant album after another in the '80s, as did Phil Collins with his solo career.  Although Phil has teased us with the idea of recording with Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford again, 1991's \\"We Can't Dance\\" remains their last album together to date.  In retrospect, Tony has admitted he was surprised at the time that Phil wanted to do another Genesis album in light of his massive commercial success as a solo artist, and it's been said repeatedly that people feel Phil was really running the show on \\"We Can't Dance\\".  All of this is extremely surprising.  Way back around the time of the album's release, there was a wonderful special on The Disney Channel called \\"No Admittance\\" which was basically a \\"making of\\" for \\"We Can't Dance\\"--it showed 3 guys who were great friends getting along extremely well, in great spirit, still brimming with creativity, and very much working as a unit; it also didn't try to pretend that the making of the album was entirely smooth sailing--it showed Phil having a very difficult time getting the lead vocal for \\"Never A Time\\" in tune.  Quite simply, Genesis delivered yet another terrific album with \\"We Can't Dance\\".      The album runs over 70 minutes, and the guys used the long running time to really do some musical exploring.  \\"Since I Lost You\\", written about the death of Eric Clapton's son, is a stately, doo-wop-flavored ballad that sounds very uncharacteristic for Genesis, and they pull it off very nicely.  The album also harkens back to the sound of \\"Abacab\\" with Phil's crisp, live drumming, and the use of REAL drums opposed to the electronic drums heavily used on \\"Invisible Touch\\".  \\"Driving The Last Spike\\" is a 10+ minute epic about the building of England's Railways in the early 1800s, with a bravura vocal performance from Phil, and simply packed with their trademark dynamics and tension-building drama.  \\"Way Of The World\\" is a soaring, achingly bittersweet power ballad with a superb, nuanced Collins vocal.  \\"Dreaming While You Sleep\\" is a chilling song about a hit-and-run accident sung from the point of view of the perpetrator.  \\"Living Forever\\" is a somewhat whimsical song about the conflicting nature of health/ nutritional reports and to not let them distort your sense of reality (something that certainly does happen to people); it's catchy, with a moody bridge, very Beatle-esque backing vocals, and an extended instrumental coda.  \\"Tell Me Why\\" is one of Phil's characteristic social comments--it's an enjoyable track, with excellent 12-string electric guitarwork, but the lyrics are admittedly quite rote and it feels like relative filler compared to all the gems contained herein.  A whopping FIVE tracks from this album gave the band top 25 hit singles in the US.  Of these, there are a couple of their trademark tender, beautifully melodic ballads--the soaring \\"Never A Time\\" which is like the \\"Throwing It All Away\\" of this album; and the smokey, atmospheric \\"Hold On My Heart\\" which is like the \\"In Too Deep\\".  \\"No Son Of Mine\\" is a devastatingly powerful epic about a kid who's disowned from his father.  The other two are quite ballsy--\\"Jesus He Knows Me\\" is a catchy uptempo track with lyrics, about a totally crass television evengelist, that are right on the money; and the bluesy \\"I Can't Dance\\" has grumbling rhythm guitar and lots of sound effects, plus cartoonish, self-mocking lyrics--again, really uncharacteristic of Genesis, but they were obviously trying to throw people for a loop with this song, and a lot of fun it is.  The album ends with \\"Fading Lights\\", another 10+ minute track, and it stuffs an extended, progressive rock-style instrumental section in between a heart-breakingly beautiful ballad that suggests maybe Genesis really knew at the time this was the end of an era.      All in all, a great album--unquestionably a must-have.  \\"We Can't Dance\\" was originally released in November of 1991, and like other albums from the early '90s that were major commercial successes, you can get this DIRT cheap on CD--if you see this on CD for $3 in a used bin in solid condition, it's an absolute STEAL.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I had high hopes for Colplay's new album and they did not disappoint. I didn't know what to expect, but the band delivered big. This is a great album and this band has loads of potential. Every song is meticulous. If every CD sounded this good, I'd probably purchase more music. You can't even compare this to their other 2 albums, the new one belongs in a class by itself.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|If you are an eagles fan this is a must have! I have been an eagles fan since their start but I haven't really listened to them lately. I saw the concert on bravo TV (some of it) and figured for the price I would buy it. Well, let me tell you, I literally had chills flowing down my spine listening and watching this via my surround sound stero and TV. Every eagle fan owes themselves this DVD. You won't be sorry you bought this.
079284131X|5.0|If you're looking for a super scary nightmare movie then this is not for you.  Childs Play is a funny but still scary movie.  The whole idea of it is that a man that is going to go to hell, puts his soul into a doll so that he can still live.  The dolls name is Chucky, and he is trying to kill a little boy named Andy so he can put his soul into him.   <br /> <br />There are four main characters: Chucky, Andy, the Mother and the Detective. <br /> <br />Chucky is a good guy doll.  He was given to Andy by his mother for his 6th birthday.  First he kills Andy's aunt, who he throws out of the kitchen window.  Later on in the movie, Andy's Mother is looking in the good guy box that chucky came in, and she finds the package of batteries.  She looks in Chucky, and he is talking and living without them.  So later on, Chucky kills his friend who taught him how to do the powers and the spell to put him self into the body's. <br /> <br />Andy is a six year old boy that is always running and having to watch out for Chucky.  After his aunt gets thrown out of the window, he stays a few days at the police station for some counseling.   Everywhere he goes, Chucky follows him.  He is a very brave boy. <br /> <br />Andy's Mother does not believe that chucky is real in the beginning.  She thinks that Andy is making everything up.   Whenever she finds out the truth about chucky, she throws him into a fire and burns him.  Now chucky does not die, but he does get burnt to a crisp.  Now everyone thinks that the mother is crazy. <br /> <br />The Detective is the person that originally killed Charles, the man that put himself into Chucky.  The Detective does not believe Andy or the Mother, until Chucky almost kills him in his car.  The detective has to do whatever he can to keep Chucky from not killing Andy. <br /> <br />This movie is rated R.  So I would recommend it to kids probably 10 and older.  Because   it is not that scary.  My friend and I thought it was a great movie, and we got scared at some scenes, but it was still funny.  I would advise you to watch Childs Play 1 before you watch 2 or 3.  Because it explains what the plot is and what happened to Chucky. <br /> <br />Overall I would give it a five.  There are some scenes that are hilarious, and some that are so scary you can't even look at the T.V. set.  But that is what makes it so good, because it has variety.   <br />
B0009HLDFU|3.0|As usual for a double album, it's a little bloated and would have made a pretty good single disc album if the filler had been removed... Unfortunately unlike previous FF records, there's nothing new here. Maybe it has to do with a halfway stable lineup, maybe Dave is trying too hard to be relevant or maybe it's just a great 90's band finally slowing down. Someone just starting with the band would be well served going back and picking up the first three albums and working on them for a while.<br /><br />I still give it 3 stars as there are a half dozen very good pop tunes on the collection and disappointing for FF is better than most releases these days.<br /><br />As far as the copy protection thing goes... don't worry about it and simply hold down the left shift key when the tray slides into your optical drive on your PC. This will stop the autoplay from starting and installing that crappy ripper.<br /><br />Oh, and to the fanbois that try to explain away that scheme and blame it all on RCA's avarice and the Foo's paltry royalties as reason to go along? You need to learn what you are talking about. Dave made the first record himself and got a distribution deal out of it. He has had a distro deal ONLY ever since. He's not signed to a label in the traditional sense... He controls all facets of the physical packaging AND makes quite a bit from each unit sold.... And even if that weren't true, can you really defend taking someone's money for a personal music license and not allowing the to use that license they way that fits their lifestyle? I use my iPod in the car and in the house and physical CDs out in the garage. If I want to use those devices, it's up to me and not RCA, the Foo Fighters, or you.

B0008KLVG4|3.0|\\"Jaws,\\" which debuted on DVD five years ago in a silver anniversary edition, circles back with a 30th-year effort that chums the marketplace with upgraded extras and packaging. There are no noticeable improvements in audio or video quality.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg, as usual, provides no commentary. But the director has plenty to say in Laurent Bouzereau's fine documentary \\"The Making of Jaws,\\" created for the 1995 laserdisc. In 2000, Universal gutted the 125-minute docu to under an hour, so it remains basically unseen. The film launched Bouzereau's triple-threat career as a making-of specialist, now with more than 130 titles to his credit.<br /><br />The hard-luck shoot's history gets a full review, including the myriad problems with mechanical sharks. Spielberg recalls \\"Jaws\\" as a \\"fun movie to watch, but not a fun movie to make.\\"<br /><br />Richard Dreyfuss and Roy Scheider vie for camera time, spinning terrific stories. For the record: Scheider insists he never referred to the great white as Bruce, and never will.

The 26-year-old Spielberg, hot off \\"The Sugarland Express,\\" is interviewed in the waters off Martha's Vineyard. He looks like a pop star but talks like a savvy pro.

B00005NNMK|1.0|You all are kidding, right? You like this!? <br /> <br />Still, I give it one star (although Amazon should consider the use of quater stars) because it makes me laugh.
B0009HLDFU|3.0|I was a waiting for this album to come out.  I was living in Seattle during the 90s (my early 20s) and Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters have always held (for me) a link back to those days of seeing great live shows at rat-hole clubs.  So with my preconceived notions and grunge tainted nostalgia firmly in hand, I happily plunked down my 15 bones on the day it came out.   <br /> <br />The first `plugged' disc has some good songs.  There are a few on here that will enter the Foo's canon of songs that must be played at every live show.  \\"No Way Back\\", \\"Last Song\\" and \\"DOA\\" are a couple of my personal favorites.  The problem is that there are too many throwaway songs (\\"Hell\\", \\"In Your Honor\\").  Additionally, there are too many songs that just have a build up, but then go nowhere.  It's the musical equivalent of going zero to sixty in a heartbeat, but then staying redlined in third gear. <br /> <br />The acoustic disc gets off to a very dreary start.  After the first few songs I was screaming for someone to get Dave Grohl a copy of \\"Sap\\", so he could hear that acoustic-alternative rock can be interesting.  Then along came \\"Another Round\\" and my opinions changed, the second 2/3s of this is excellent.  \\"Razor\\" is a great capper to the album set.  Too often this album falls back on to the `Foo Formula' (which Dave learned from Kurt) but then pulls it's punch leaving you with a dull song that goes nowhere, misses out on having any emotion. <br /> <br />I recall seeing the Foo Fighters at the Bridge School Benefit (an all acoustic show) 3 or 4 years ago, and Dave made a point of saying several times that playing an acoustic set is something that they had never done before.  It was a great set then...they ROARED while playing acoustic.  They've added a lot more songs that do (or would) work great acoustically.  Here's to hoping that they will play some more acoustic shows every now and then.

B000063DFN|5.0|After their album Piece of Mind, (1983) Iron Maiden started to change their sound a bit as shown by this record.  The songs this time are longer and more epic (specifically Rime of the Ancient Mariner).  They are just as brilliant or even more so than Iron Maiden's previous ones and all of the band members  are in their top form.  <br />Aces High is a catchy single about air-plane combat.  2 Minutes to Midnight is one of Maiden's most known songs and although not my personal favorite, is a great song that defines what Iron Maiden is.  Flash of the Blade has a catchy guitar riff and is a bit less epic than the other tracks.  Losfer Words (Big 'Orra) is one of Iron Maiden's only instrumentals and is rather average.  The Duellists, like Flash of the Blade, is about sword fighting and is a pretty decent 6 minute song.  Back in the Village is one of my least favorites from the album and gets a bit repetitive but is alright nonetheless.  The next song starts the point when this album starts getting really good.  Powerslave is a 7 minute epic with an amazing guitar solo, even has a drum solo if you listen closely, and is among the best off this album.  Finally, the 13-minute epic Rime of the Ancient Mariner is one Maiden's greatest songs ever and is a true masterpiece based on the piece of literature. <br />Overall, it's not a perfect album as seen by Losfer Words and Back in the Village but is an awesome one and a true classic.  It's right up there with Number of the Beast among others and clearly shows that Iron Maiden is superior to any other heavy metal band of the 1980's (cept maybe Metallica).
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Everything that makes Dream Theater is epitomized here, and they still cover new ground without looking back.  Anyone that speaks badly of this album clearly had WAY too many expectations, which in my mind will do nothing but RUIN your enjoyment of anything.   <br /> <br />These guys will NEVER look back musically, so stop expecting them to, and enjoy this brilliant work!
B00097A5I6|5.0|Words cannot describe the amazingness of this album. I feel like Oasis is finally whole again. They are in tune with what great music sounds like. Totally back on track.  <br /> <br />The best song is definitely The Importance of Being Idle. It sounds like their old stuff. The Morning Glory days. Just incredible. I think I've listened to that song about one million times.  <br />Let Their Be Love is also reeeally outstanding.  <br />OASIS REIGNS AGAIN!!!!!! :) <br />
B0007Y4USW|5.0|I purchased this CD the day it was released.  The reason it is a limited edition is because it comes with a two-sided poster;  one side is the statuesque and beautiful mariah, and the other side has all the lyrics and linear notes.  I thought maybe it would have extra songs, since it did say it was a limited edition, but the poster will no doubt be a collector's item one day, and I plan to frame mine soon.  I recommend buying both the limited edition and the regular release.  That way you can frame the poster or do what you will with it.<br /><br />Just thought people might want to know why this is a limited edition.  I always appreciate it when my fellow amazon.com shoppers leave interesting facts in their reviews.<br /><br />If you're looking for extra tracks, a new release of Mimi is coming out soon as an import from Japan--it will have two extra tracks titled \\"Secret Love\\" and \\"Sprung.\\"  Also, \\"We Belong Together\\" will be out this month--make sure you get the right one, though.  The one with all the remixes is not the first one that comes up on amazon.com.<br /><br />Peace out, lambs.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay are pros at making music, it's as simple as that. I think it's clear by now that this album is about as good as it gets in modern music.  <br />Anyone who disagrees must be lacking ears.
6300263673|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies ever since I was a child. I never get sick of it and can watch it over and over again! My favorite is the ending where baby runs up to Johnny and she jumps up into the air and does that arch thing with Johnny holding her up. AWESOME! I highly recomend this movie for all ages, altough there are some sexual references, ther are very little! ;)
B000002BBY|5.0|In my mind, this is what music is all about. If there ever was a definition of great music, a picture of What's the Story Morning Glory would be right underneath it. <br />It's not even about one particular sound or one particular moment. The whole album is an incredible experience. It makes you so glad to be where you are and doing what you're doing, listening to it. It's one of those albums that you wish you could hear everyday for the first time.
B00008K78M|5.0|I've never seen Laura Pausini live so I was really excited about this dvd. I knew already that Laura has a magnificent voice but still I was surprised to really HEAR how good it is.  <br /> <br />Laura sang all of her hits since 1993 'till 2001 and some other songs which weren't on her collection album The Best of: E ritorno da te.  <br />Absolutely the best moment is when Biagio Antonacci arrives to the stage to sing Tra te e il Mare with Laura. The audience goes crazy and the whole performance got filled with the friendship between these two artists and the passion which they both have for music. Another thing that I love about Laura's concert is that she makes me love songs which I didn't like before, for exemple Un'Emergenza d'Amore. Also One More Time sounds ten times better live than on the record. The concert isn't just about Laura and her very successful career...she welcomes the fans to be part of it... her music, her show, her life. That's one of the reasons why love and respect her work so much..    <br />
B0006L16N8|5.0|No need to look any further for the BEST album of 2005. It has officially arrived courtesy of Coldplay. I have been playing this CD for a week and it just improves with each spin. You just don't know how good X&Y really is until you play something else. After listening to a new CD that I had purchased, I had no choice but to draw the conclusion that X&Y is the masterpiece that others are claiming it is. Every song leaves you in awe. It's amazing that so many great songs could end up on one album. So stick with X&Y. You won't be disappointed.  <br /> <br />FAVORITES: White Shadows, What If, Twisted Logic
B00009L1OB|4.0|Duran Duran crashed the US market with \\"Rio\\" and the massive success of the single \\"Is There Something I Should Know.\\" It gave them an incredible sense of boldness when it came time to create this, their third full album. With all the brashness of youth, they plunged forward into artiness, mixing middle eastern percussion and some of LeBon's quirkiest poetry to date for the first single, \\"Union Of The Snake.\\" Despite the fact that their current fan base was largely comprised of teenage girls, \\"Snake's\\" Bowie-esque style was far more than what the more cynical of the fab five's detractors likely thought LeBon and Co capable.<br /><br />This is not to say that the band's somewhat limited reach didn't jump the shark a few times here. Think of the line \\"My head is full of chopstick\\" from \\"Cracks In The Pavement\\" if you need a good WTF head scratching moment. And the instrumental \\"Tiger Tiger\\" is - while more polished than the debut's \\"Tel Aviv\\" - somewhat pointless. It is when Duran Duran play to their strengths that \\"Seven And The Ragged Tiger\\" earns its stripes.<br /><br />That excellence carries through half the album, primarily the singles. \\"The Reflex\\" (eventually given a major mixdown by Nile Rogers before become a number one record), \\"New Moon on Monday\\" (with its mock epic video) and \\"Union Of The Snake\\" were all deserved hits, and \\"Shadows On Your Side\\" could have easily followed them. You could also sniff the cracks forming between the art school of the soon to form Arcadia (\\"Of Crime and Passion\\") and Power Station's rock (\\"Shadows\\").<br /><br />Like \\"Rio\\" before it, the best of Duran Duran stuck to pure pop on \\"Seven and The Ragged Tiger.\\" Given that the lackluster \\"Arena\\" and the disjointed sounding \\"Wild Boys\\" followed, this was the final of the big early albums to fire on all points.
0671027573|4.0|Jaine and three work friends gather at the local watering hole to commiserate on the lack of good men. They jokingly create a list that definitively describes \\"Mr. Perfect,\\" and it is published first in a company newsletter, then suddenly the national media are interested not only in the list, but the authors. The list contains everything from niceness, to sexual prowess, so the authors are pretty embarrassed.<br /><br />Jaine is having problems with her neighbor - he has odd hours, drives a noisy car, and is pretty scruffy - he must be a drug dealer. After an altercation where she loses her temper, she discovers that Sam is in fact a police detective.  But soon, she is finding herself intrigued by Sam, particularly his lack of window coverings (and choice of sleepwear), and soon, they are succumbing to their mutual attraction, just as a crazed killer is hunting down the women behind \\"the list.\\"<br /><br />While the suspense is not that riveting, the entire premise is pretty clever, and the charismatic leads (and let's face it, vintage Linda Howard steam), as well as the witty dialogue keep you glued from page one.
B00003CXBK|5.0|After hearing Roger Ebert and others rave about Miyazaki I finally broke down and bought Princess Mononoke, and I'm glad I did.  This movie is very well done.  The animation is quality, with beautifully detailed backgrounds.  The plot is unique and very original; Miyazaki's emphasis on nature as a character is new to Americans, but the story is very good and will hold your attention all the way through.   <br /> I have had difficulty getting into anime in the past, but Miyazaki's quality level is so high it makes his movies a pretty safe bet for anyone.  One other thing, although there is no profanity or nudity in this film, it is probably not suitable for very young children; there are some battle scenes where people get limbs cut off.  The battles are part of the plot and thus the violence is not gratuitous, but none the less you might wait until your kids are a little older to let them watch it.
B00097A5HW|3.0|Shakira is a great artist whose voice bespells the listener no matter what she sings.  However, it appears that her best so far was \\"Donde Estan los Ladrones.\\"  The songs in this album are very reminecent of \\"Laundry Service.\\" They are similar enough to have been rejected ideas for that album. <br /> <br />For a new fan, I don't know if I'd introduce them to this album, especially if they are English speakers, better to start them on \\"Donde Estan los Ladrones.\\"  For the fan though, collect it.  Even if you don't like the album much it'll give him/her more Shakira to savor.
B00000IQW3|5.0|The Star League of Planets defends the 150 planets of the Star League with the Great Frontier built by the advanced technology of the Planet Rylos. War is not their passion. Earth is not mature enough yet to be approached and granted permission to join the Star League. But nonetheless, the Rylons will also defend Earth until it matures. Fighting wars is not what the Rylons are about; they recruit Starfighters who have \\"the gift\\", \\"the gift\\" amongst the billions of inhabitants from the different planets in the Star League. Now, the Rylons key spy has been captured and caught, and the secret of the Great Frontier lays in the hands of the evil Ko-dan who are the Rylons' enemy, and who are also being helped by the evil son (Zur) of the Emperor of Rylos. One group of about ten Starfighters against the whole Armada? Yes, that is \\"the gift\\", the chance of becoming a Starfighter and held in high esteem by all the Planets and billions of inhabitants of the Star League. <br />Those who have \\"the gift\\" are the only warriors in the Star League. <br /> <br />I thoroughly enjoy this movie for its charm, and I now enjoy the DVD, originally having the movie on Beta, when it first came out on tape. The tape is worn, but the movie is a classic! <br /> <br />Recruiting from a non-member planet like Earth is forbidden, and highly unususal. But this Earthling passed the test, ah the test, and has \\"the gift\\". \\"And afterall Earth is in danger too\\" quips Centauri (Robert Preston). This is the premis of the movie, taken a college-bound human, living a not so normal I'm the fix-it man of the trailer park under the alien Centauri's wings, so to speak. But Alex (Lance Guest) does not want to go to the community college, and wants to go away to college if his loan is approved. <br />The loan however is not approved, but his mother (Barbara Bossen) states that he can still go to community college with his friends, even if that won't amount to much. But Alex wanted to have big plans to pursue hislove (Catherine Mary Stewart) who he grew up with in the broken down trailer park. Alex wanted a new life, but a Starfighter? His mother always thought that Alex would go away someday, but to another Planet? <br /> <br />I still enjoy watching this movie, from the first scene to the last. An alien abduction, out in a trailer park in the middle of nowhere, that turns out good. Even if people watch this movie over and over again, as I have, usually one will never tire of this movie, even knowing what scenes are coming next in the movie. A fun movie, encompassing total unreal expectations, with humans from Planet Earth being thrust far into the future of what is considered science fiction as far as humans in a trailer park are concerned, made real! <br />
B0009IW88A|4.0|First i Hated it,now i love it. <br />The first time I listened this score i was very disapointed. <br />i was waiting Zimmer cool tunes and Howard great use of orchestra. <br />Well...we have a nice (but bland) Howarish love theme,and the rest very Zimmerish score. <br />this score have all the syles possible: <br />Experimental music:track 1 <br />Dramatic music:4,6,12 <br />Love music:7,11 <br />Action music:3,8,10 <br />Suspense and terror music:5,6,9 <br />this score have a amazing main theme heard in track 3 and 10.Also in the end credits(the best track,not in the cd.Please zimmer can you send me more music to my email???:P).But zimmer and howard not wanted to score a normal superhero movie. <br />A zimmer interview you can read here: <br />[...]  <br />Its a amazing score. <br />The only negative aspect is some great epic /action tunes are missed in cd release.Zimmer says the action music is not good in cd release,but i think its worst some moody music.This score with 2 more action/epic tracks could be the perfect score.I will be waiting for a promo ;) <br />Buy it!!!!
1881273156|5.0|Having yet to be married, I initially hesitated when a friend told me I should read it; however, I soon found it difficult to put down. The book, while it is mainly geared toward married couples, can and should be utilized by dating couples, and singles as well. The book is easy to read and understand (I only found myself thumbing through the dictionary a few times) as compared to other relationship-topic books.<br /><br />Mr. Chapman provides many real-life examples of couples and the problems they are facing. Having worked as a sociologist and an anthropologist (among a host of other areas), he understands human behavior and human tendencies...and most importantly, that each individual has their own specific needs (i.e. the five love languages).<br /><br />Whether you are in a failing marriage, newly weds, dating, or single...you will find this book informative and helpful. Not only can it help you recover from a marital disaster, but it can help you mitigate one.
B0009HLDFU|3.0|please stop calling the foo fighters ff. we all know there is only one ff and this is fear factory. the foo fighters suck. dave ghrol should go away for a while. kurt cobain told dave ghrol he didn't like his songs. we should have taken a cue from a drugged out dead man. i've heard three or four songs. all of them are the same. there is nothing new. i want my grunge back. the foo fighters time and time again disappoint me. i want their music to be like grunge. they said themselves this was their hardest album. their first one was just a good nirvana rip-off. tell dave to go back to that or go away.
B00097A5HW|4.0|As you know by now, Shakira is back with her first all-Spanish album since \\"Donde Estan Los Ladrones\\" (not counting MTV Unplugged) and it's terrific. <br /> <br />On first listen, you'll get carried away by her voice. It is unique, powerful and versatile. But we sorta knew that going in. <br /> <br />On subsequent spins, if you take away her vocals, this may be her most \\"American\\" sounding album yet. Perhaps that is due to the influence of executive producer Rick Rubin. <br /> <br />The opener, \\"En Tus Pupilas\\" is a soft-rock, emotional ballad that we fans will recognize and welcome instantly. <br /> <br />It is followed by \\"La Pared\\", which proves she has been listening to Coldplay, as the music to the chorus is a total homage to \\"Clocks.\\" It's not subtle at all, and it sounds great. <br /> <br />Much has been made about the first single, \\"La Tortura\\" and it's reggaeton elements, but if you recall the album \\"Pies Descalzos\\" (an album given to me by my cousin when I was visiting my family in Barranquilla years ago), you'll know Shakira has been doing this sort of stuff for a long, long time. Actually, I think the majority of the song has a huge Police sound to it during the verses, slipping into the more obviously reggaeton-like mode during Sanz' chorus. <br /> <br />\\"Obtener Un Si\\" is the surprising stunner on the album. It's an exquisite, retro-pop tune with vintage ice-skating-rink organ, sweet string sections and lovely, delicate melodies. This really demonstrates that her range simply is limitless. <br /> <br />\\"Dia Especial\\" is a fairly generic midtempo pop-rocker, and the hubbub about \\"Escondite Ingles\\" being \\"punk\\" is laughable. It's not. It's an obvious nod to The B-52's (check out the cheesy organ), but it's more like the pogoing power pop of New Wave. It's multiple time changes recall, in a good way, Green Day's recent efforts, and I loved the thrashy, messy ending. <br /> <br />\\"No\\" is another one of those Shakira songs that build from a mostly acoustic,introspective piece into a widescreen, dramatic epic like \\"Tu\\" and \\"Inevitable\\". It's not quite up to those standards, but it works just fine. <br /> <br />Who knew she could be Kylie Minogue? She does just that, in her own style of course, on \\"Las De La Intuicion\\", down to the disco-pop sounds and whispered back-ups. <br /> <br />\\"Dia De Enero\\" is a gorgeous folk-rock song and \\"La Imprescindible\\" is a noisy, percussive, synthesizer-filled 80's-like song that still somehow manages to work. <br /> <br />The extra tracks are an acoustic \\"La Pared\\" and a remixed \\"La Tortura\\". <br /> <br />The single best thing about this album has to be her voice. What an instrument! She moves confidently across genres, maintaining her unique mannerisms but becoming so rich and full (Dia De Enero) or soft and cute (Obtener Un Si) depending on what it takes to best serve the song. <br /> <br />Each song here is well crafted, lovingly produced and performed.  <br /> <br />This may not reach the dizzying heights of \\"Donde Estan Los Ladrones\\", but this one just might age better. <br /> <br />This is really good stuff...I cannot WAIT for Volume 2, which I understand is all new songs, all in English...should be interesting, no?
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I only caught a few episodes when this show first aired. <br />(There seems to be a pattern here) <br />I liked the show so ,of course, it was cancelled in favor of <br />the endless \\"reality\\", brainless crap that bombards the airwaves these days. (sigh) <br /> <br />The short and skinny is, this show was astoundingly good in humor, story, acting, and FX. Trust me. This show was on the money. <br />Don't watch this expecting Star Trek or the usual SF shows out there. Firefly has it's own unique voice and look and this is a large reason why the show was so special. <br /> <br />The only people who don't like Firefly seem to be the narrow minded retarded drones that tune in regularly to Idol and the rest. (No offense to you retards out there)  <br /> <br />The story of Firefly flows along throughout the series. Bits and pieces are picked up and explained in different episodes. <br />There is rarely a quick, cut and dry answer to the problems the crew faces. Which, gives the show a more real, grounded feeling than the usual \\"episode problem\\" + 40 minutes of FX, bad dialogue, cardboard characters = resolution, move to next episode we are used to. <br /> <br />I could go on and on but, the bottom line is this show is worth your time and money. Buy it today. Enjoy. And then go see the movie version coming out in September '05.
B00008AWOG|5.0|This is probably Opeth's most accessible album (Blackwater Park comes close but comes in second because of its length, although it's not overlong by any stretch of the imagination). For people who are already familiar with Opeth, you should own this already; I'm writing this for people who are dissatified with the current music scene and looking for something new. Opeth are a unique combination of intelligence, beauty, and brutality. Simply put, they are the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Metallica, or Guns N Roses of this era. This is no ordinary death metal; you'll notice that there are no Satanic or Paganistic lyrics. \\"Still Life\\" is actually a concept album. I have heard many different interpretations, but I see it as based on Shakespeare's \\"Othello\\" (the first track is entitled \\"The Moor\\"). Basically the storyline is that a man goes away for a long time and comes back to find his wife, Melinda, with another man. The story is pretty interesting and even comes with a surprise ending. <br />As far as the music goes, this music is more accessible than some of their older stuff, but they sacrifice none of their musical vision to get there. \\"The Moor\\" starts out with an acoustic section, but don't be fooled, this is probably Opeth's heaviest song ever. The vocals, both death and clean are fantastic, and the guitar riff stuck in my head for days. \\"Moonlapse Vertigo\\" continues Opeth's tradition of thinking of awesome names for their songs. Opeth has claimed the British prog-rock band Camel as one of their biggest influences, and it is quite evident in this song. \\"The Face of Melinda\\" is a two-part song; the first part is entirely acoustic, while the second part employs distorted guitars but Akerfeldt continues with the clean vocals, giving this well-written song a doom-metal sound. \\"Serenity Painted Death\\" starts out with some memorable guitar work before giving way a slower riff that metal-heads like me find it nearly impossible not to headbang to. The riff in the chorus is good as well, but the death vocals in the chorus don't work so well; Akerfeldt sounds like he's burping the words \\"Serenity Painted Death.\\" They make up for that, though, with a good guitar solo. Unfortunately, the rest of the song isn't as memorable as the beginning, but overall this is still a worthwhile song. \\"White Cluster\\" also features impressive guitar work; Opeth isn't noramlly known for their guitar solos, but the solo in this song isn't really complex or technical, but still is powerful and arguably their best solo in any song. When the song ends, it does something that very few songs in concept albums do; close out the album and leave the listener satisfied. <br />Now let me remind you that Opeth is in no way \\"musical fast-food,\\" if you will. It took me about ten listens before my I started picking out my favorite parts, yet I still am discovering new aspects of the songs that I hadn't noticed before, nearly three months after I first listened to it. So if you give it time, I can guarantee that it will pay off. Do I really need to say that this album is highly recommended?
1400031087|5.0|\\"A Million Little Pieces\\" is told with brutal, in your face honesty and an almost hyper active writing style.  I found it to be absolutely brilliant.  This is the story of an addict by an addict and doesn't try to paint it as anything saintly or appologetic. I was very pleased with this purchase and do not hesitate to recommend \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" to other readers. I also recommend \\"My Fractured Life\\", \\"The Glass Castle\\", \\"Running With Scissors\\", \\"Dry\\", and \\"Smashed.\\"
B00005NGZX|5.0|I'd like to preface this review by saying that I have heard Cryptopsy, Meshuggah, Strapping Young Lad, Neurosis, Anaal Nathrack, Origin, and most (but not all!) other bands that contend for heaviest or most intense on the planet. And having heard them I can make the following statement with a quite a bit of confidence:     Jane Doe is the heaviest and most intense album ever.     I don't think any other statement really conveys the intensity of Jane Doe accurately. If I said \\"most\\" it would imply that Converge are one of those bands that make it feel like a vice is being placed on my brain and tightened, when in reality it actively gives me a headache and makes my skull feel like it is melting. They might even be mistaken as just the leaders of the metalcore genre. They're much better than that. Kurt Ballou's guitar lines are akin to having red hot coals inserted into your ear, Jacob Bannon's demonic screams are perhaps the epitome of emotional catharsis, and the rhythm section of Ben Koller and Nate Newton hit you like an uppercut to the face. The one thing that remains constant throughout Jane Doe is that it is loud and cathartic, and it is not what 99% of the population would consider pleasant.     In fact the first time Jane Doe crushed my cerebellum, a year and a half ago when I was just discovering the wonders of underground metal, I didn't like it. I respected its intensity but it was simply too much for me, and I would always have to turn it off after a few songs because it never failed to give me a painful headache. But I still relistened to it every few months, to see if it was in fact as hellish as I remembered it, and, even after I got used to bands like Origin and The Dillinger Escape Plan, it still was. But then, after about ten or so listens spaced out over the course of a year, the insane genius that is Converge finally reached me: what really makes Jane Doe amazing is not only the intensity, but also the song variety and the way Converge sound so spontaneous playing such well thought out music.     While the first half of the album is fairly straightforward structure-wise, it does not lack variety. The blastbeat-filled opener \\"Concubine\\" starts the album off with a \\"kick you in the face\\" motif and is quickly followed by some Dillinger Escape Plan style staccato rhythms on \\"Fault and Fracture\\". The band even goes extremely simple and punky on \\"Homewrecker\\". The second half of the album, starting with the indescribably weird \\"Phoenix in Flight\\", is where Converge really prove that they are artists. \\"Thaw\\" is filled with such agony that every second of its four and a half minute length is painful to listen to, even more so than the rest of the album. The epic title track is so well written and arranged that it makes even bands with the \\"progressive\\" label attached to them sound primitive by comparison. Every second of its 13 minutes grabs your attention so forcefully that the song seems to end much faster than it should.     On Jane Doe, Converge have crafted a classic, extreme metal/hardcore album. It simply crushes everything else as far as intensity goes, the members of the band are amazing musicians as well as composers, and they never let their technical ability get in the way of the energy, feeling, and emotion in their music. Moral of the story: Converge are better than you.

0679731377|5.0|This is my first review of a book... so bear with me... I've read a lot but never tried to compile my thoughts about them in any coherent way.<br /><br />Julian Barnes has a very endearing writing style, and he knows how to use it. The _History of the World..._ is divided into a bunch of different sections, each being any combination of heartwarming, super-analytical, satirical, humourus and so on. He starts of with probably the most accesible and most likely to draw the reader in stories, a tale of Noah's Ark from a very different and odd perspective: that of woodworms.<br /><br />After that the book takes on a much more abstract route, as he analyzes religion, a trial of woodworms(written in a somewhat hard to understand at first, but oddly comical formal style), a chilling tale of terrorists boarding a boat, a very in depth analysis of a 19th century painting and a huge variety of other topics. Each one is carried along by his magnificient writing style(which switches from story to story, but for each one he could be writing about the most boring of topics and I would still find it entertaining to read).<br /><br />This is definitely a great book by an intriguing writer who I will try to read some more stuff of his.
0553212737|5.0|Jane Austen's Emma was a wonderful book.  I think it gives Pride and Prejudice a run for its money because you get to see Emma grow as a person from being arragont to being kind.   <br /> <br />Now here is a basic Readers' Digest summary.  Emma Woodhouse, a bright and wealthy young woman, and her father lose Emma's governess, Mrs. Weston(\\"poor miss Taylor\\") because she has gotten married.   Emma brags to a good family friend,Mr. Knightley, that she predicted the match herself.  She then wants to be a matchmaker.  However, Mr. Woodhouse decides to disapprove of every marriage.   <br /> <br />To replace Mrs. Weston, Emma befriends Harriet Smith, a young poor girl wiht no record of her real birth mother.  The two become good friends.  Emma finds a wealthy man, Mr. Elton, that she thinks would be perfect for Harriet.  Harriet grows to love Mr. Elton, but the feeling isn't mutual.   <br /> <br />A poor old maid, Miss Bates has her niece, Jane Fairfax, visit the town.  Emma is envious of Jane because Jane is everything Emma wants to be: respected, elegant, and musical.   <br /> <br />Frank Churchill, Mrs. Weston's step-son, visits the town.  Charming and handsome, he pays much attention to Emma.  Many speculate the two as a perfect match.  While others approve, Mr. Knightley is determined to think ill of him.   <br /> <br />Well, I'm sorry, but I hate giving away books, but believe me, this book is worth it.  I will warn you that Austen tends to ramble on, but if you hang in there you will love it!
B000002H38|5.0|Rapture simply the best album of any genre released in the 80's.<br /><br />Every song on this CD is memorable, the best performance by the most stylish voice of the last century or this.

B00008WG3U|1.0|Look, these guys have been around since the 80's and they rocked back in the day but lately their stuff is sounding repetitive and used. I think it's about time these guys hung up the plaids and guitars because granted the more people you can bring into politics is good but really it just isn't what it used to be from them.
B000002LBH|5.0|i'm a very seasoned classic rock and jazz listener. i just do not know how this fantastic band escaped my eye for such a long time. this is simply the apex of pop music and when you listen to them you know there's something special here - it is just magic. morrissey's vocals, poetry and idealism are so rare in the music industry where talent and originality have become a byline. he catches your imagination with his art, wit, openness and compassion. johnny marr's shimmering fret work provides the able foil to his band leader's genius. if you fall in love with this album but still don't want to buy the other individual albums, check out the other great collection - singles (with the legendary jacket cover). there're only seven overlaps between the two and you'd get another 11 extra songs there. great great great stuff!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Wonderful, superb, stunning. Gerard Butler must be the most handsome and best Phantom there ever was and ever will be.  Has tremendous screen presence and seems the part was written for him.  Ditto Emmy Rossum.  And she is a much better actress than Sarah Brightman is.  The singer/actor Patrick Wilson, who plays Raoul is perfect with probably the best singing voice of the three.  I never tire of watching it.  I have not had the opportunity to see the stage play, but found this movie version a real winner.
B00030590I|4.0|What is Yimou Zhang's fixation with mixing martial arts with the tragic love story?  I guess it doesn't really matter, since this time he seems to have pulled it off pretty well.  \\"Hero\\" does what \\"House of Flying Daggers\\" tried but failed to do with any credibility -- to tell a poignant tale of passionate romance within the context of the classic Chinese martial arts film.<br /><br />Jet Li plays \\"Nameless\\", ostensibly the hero who saved the emperor of Qin from the deadly trio of assassins, Sky, Broken Sword and Falling Snow (the latter two being lovers).  Nameless is brought before the emperor, bearing the weapons of the three assassins as proof that he vanquished them, to be rewarded for his feat.  The emperor lavishes great honors on Nameless, and questions him about how he was able to defeat such powerful enemies.  As Nameless tells his tale, the storyline is played out as a series of flashbacks depicting each encounter.<br /><br />The emperor, however, is suspicious of Nameless, thinking him to be a crafty assassin himself and in league with the other three, using these concocted events as a way to get close to the emperor.  The emperor offers his own account of what he thinks really happened, and the story is retold to a different conclusion, again through a series of flashbacks.  Nameless notes that parts of the emperor's rendition are correct, but others are not, and tells a third and final version of the tale.  This leads to a surprising denouement, where the relationship of Broken Sword and Falling Snow is brought to a tragic climax.  The two disagree vehemently on whether the greater good would be served by killing the tyrannical emperor, as opposed to letting this strong ruler unite all the nations of China under one banner and thus end the wars that have raged for generations.  Broken Sword's ideal of \\"our land\\" and the good of the nation overrides his desire to kill the emperor, provoking a deadly challenge by Snow, with unexpected and unintended results.  In my opinion it is this element of the story that lends a great air of nobility to the movie as a whole, and redeems what might otherwise be just another high-tech martial arts movie.<br /><br />The rest of the film was relatively well done.  I thought the initial fight sequences involving Sky were great, but from there on the director relied way too much on the use of wires and special effects.  The remaining action scenes were a visual feast but lacked any real credibility, especially the fight at the lake, where Nameless and Broken Sword demonstrated an uncanny ability to walk on water.  The director's use of color was overwhelming and unmistakeable -- and at times overdone.  In general, though, the effect was positive and lent itself to a visually beautiful, if somewhat overly artsy, presentation.  If I were to compare \\"Hero\\" with \\"Crouching Tiger\\" and \\"Flying Daggers\\", I would definitely say this one is the best movie of the three.ion it is this element of the story that lends a great air of nobility to the movie as a whole, and redeems what might otherwise be just another high-tech martial arts movie.

B0001HLVS2|4.0|I've never read the books which this movie is based on so I can't say whether they are faithful, but I really enjoyed the movie. Russell Crowe plays Captain Aubrey, a British soldier in command of the HMS Surprise. They are sailing past Brazil looking for a French ship of privateers. The French ship is larger, faster, and has more guns. Her captain manages to sneak up on the British ship twice and Crowe and his crew are lucky to survive to get a third chance at them.  <br /> <br />The movie is a little too long and there are a couple of times when it gets off track onto things that don't really advance the story. But it does a great job of showing what is was like to serve in the navy in the early nineteenth century. The battle scenes are amazing. I'd love to know how they filmed them because they are so realistic you would swear the actors were having a real sea battle. This was a well written, acted and directed film.
B00005JNJT|5.0|How could you possibly give this movie a bad review? This is the best Batman of the series. There is not one major plothole in this story. Christopher Nolan has done the best job of any Batman director. Christian Bale is the best Batman ever hands down. He would kick Keaton's ass any day. This is the best comic movie to come out. It is better than both Spiderman's hands down. This movie is actually true to the Dark Knight comic it's not supposed to be very funny just dark. So don't tell me not to think when i see it i was thinking the whole time and i really loved this movie.
B000002KAT|2.0|Astral Weeks has been praised to the sky by rock critics and fans alike. It made the ten best in Rolling Stone's top 500 albums of all time. As a person who is not a big fan of Morrison, but who has tried to be, I bought it with high expectations. I was very disappointed. Astral Weeks is in desperate need of editing and polishing. It's like a freshman essay with some good ideas, but which needs drastic cutting and reworking. In short, Morrison needs an editor. I think a casual fan of his, as I am, need only buy the \\"Best of\\" collection. Astral Weeks is like a Joyce novel that has kissed the Blarney Stone too long. As with Joyce, Morrison tests your patience. Too often, he repeats, in a stream of consciousness vein, the same lyrics over and over, such as \\"you breath in, you breath out, you breath in, you breath out, you breath in, you breath out,\\" etc. I do not mind repetition in a song, per se. I don't mind when George Harrison sings \\"please don't be long\\" 27 times on \\"Blue Jay Way\\" because \\"Blue Jay Way\\" has interesting, trippy music. There are some interesting musical ideas on Astral Weeks, but it perhaps has enough music for a 35 minute album, not its 50 minutes running time. Morrison should have had the discipline to have trimmed down these songs. And his voice was not really made for the quiet, acoustic, flute-filled arrangements that make up the bulk of this CD. He works much better when accompanied by horns and a good, driving rhythm section. But, you don't get a \\"Domino\\" or \\"Moondance\\" here.
B0000AQVCL|2.0|Wow, is this album derivative!  The style is very similar to other groups (see the amazon review above).  I actually find myself humming the originals as they sing.  Even the cover is quite similar to one we've all seen before (Beatles - Revolver).  The tunes are catchy, but I have a hard time listening to the album.  I'm amazed these guys aren't in court.  My advice is listen to the classic rock station, then buy the real thing.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|one of the best filmed and smartest series' i've seen. the combination of sci-fi and western works seamlessly and i love it. easily worth it at twice the price. i cant wait for the movie \\"serenity\\" to come out. also, the sci-fi channel is bringing it back! they're airing the first season in its entirety this summer sometime (fox aired something like 11 out of the 14 episodes). hopefully the'll pick it up for a second season if the rating are good enough. i know i'll be watching.
B0009OPO0S|5.0|Note: The Oral Fixation or Fijacion Oral album has been split in two, with the Spanish version appearing first on June 7, 2005 (and called Fijacion Oral, Vol. 1; and about seven years after her last all-new exclusively Spanish music cd). Oral Fixation Vol. 2 will be released November 2005 and apparently will be entirely in English.  <br /> <br />Fijacion Oral, Volume 1: Music:  <br /> <br />1. En Tus Pupilas (In Your Eyes?): words by Shakira; Music by Shakira & Luis F. Ochoa  <br />Review: Nice soft song, good background music (instruments), good backing singing. This is a good song with good backing instruments. Different sounding than her famous hard-charging rock songs. The song grows on you, and seems to be better after returning to it after hearing the rest of the album.  <br />Run Time: 4:20 Rating: 4.36  <br /> <br />2. La Pared (The Wall): words by Shakira; Music by Shakira & Lester Mendez  <br />Review: Good background music, & singing; interesting song but seems to lack something (or, due to listening to the other version, it seems to have added too much electronic noise). If at first you don't find a particular song to be as good as you remember Shakira can be, give the song some additional runs through the playing cycle. This particular one, after returning to it several times, seems better than I had originally thought.  <br />Run time: 3:17 Rating: 4.33  <br /> <br />3. La Tortura (The Torture): with guest artist Alejandro Sanz; words by Shakira & Sanz; Music by Shakira & Luis F. Ochoa & Sanz  <br />Review: Stronger song. Definitely different sounding from first two. Good beat to the music. This backing music to this song seems to sound closer to earlier Shakira rock work. There is certainly a rap-like quality to Sanz parts of the song.  <br />Run Time: 3:33 Rating: 4.27  <br /> <br />4. Obtener Un Si (Get a Yes?/To Obtain If?): words by Shakira & Music by Shakira & Lester Mendez  <br />Review: Interesting change from last song (as in, surprising). Softer overall feel to the song. Good backing instrument work. I believe this song might be better enjoyed during the first hearing, as subsequent hearings remind the listener how different this song (softer, more jazzy than rock) is than other of her work. Still, a rather good song (and the only one of two songs that did not have its initial rating changed).  <br />Run Time: 3:17 Rating: 4.35  <br /> <br />5. Dia Especial (Special Day): with guest artist Gustavo Cerati; words by Gustavo Cerati & Music by Cerati, Shakira & Luis F. Ochoa  <br />Review: Great strong song, good instrument work. Another song that is better after repeated trips through the play list (especially when that electronic wave starts up). Run Time: 4:20 Rating: 4.33  <br /> <br />6. Escondite Ingles: Music by Shakira  <br />Review: Good instrument work, but still a little too repetitive. Singing seemed shaky (odd, after further listening, I'm beginning to think that shakiness came from the poor CD player than the singer).  <br />Run Time: 3:10 Rating: 4.23  <br /> <br />7. No: with guest artist Gustavo Cerati; words by Shakira & music by Shakira & Lester Mendez  <br />Review: Slow song, but picks up nicely near the end. Good, interesting song, not much to say other than this is the second song that didn't have its initial rating change. Run Time: 4:46 Rating: 4.34  <br /> <br />8. Las De La Intuicion (Those Of The Intuition): words by Shakira; music by Shakira & Luis F. Ochoa  <br />Review: Good opening beat, stronger singing on this song. Better with repeated listening (and it was the highest rated after first listening to this cd).  <br />Run Time: 3:39 Rating: 4.55  <br /> <br />9. Dia De Enero (A day in January): music by Shakira  <br />Review: Interesting, opening singing without background instruments, then instruments start (actually, after further trips through the play list, I notice that the opening does include some instrument work, but harder to hear than normal). Run Time: 2:55 Rating: 4.27  <br /> <br />10. Lo Imprescindible (The Essential Thing): words by Shakira; music by Shakira & Lester Mendez  <br />Review: Somewhat disco-like opening (continues, somewhat, throughout). Interesting song, somewhat different from the others, due to that opening. A rather good song, just gets better as it turns up on the playing list. Run Time: 3:55 Rating: 4.50  <br /> <br />11. La Pared (Acoustic version)  <br />Review: Interesting version. This version seems to sound better without all that electronic noise in the way the first time I listened to it, then the version on track 2 seemed better. Both are good songs.  <br />Run Time: 2:33 Rating: 4.27  <br /> <br />12. La Tortura (Shaketon Remix)  <br />Review: Ok, this time they've added more electronic noise. Oddly enough, I think I like this version better. There's a certain beat that's quite addictive. Run Time: 3:12 Rating: 4.38  <br /> <br />Overall runtime: 43:38 (which includes some seconds of blank air that I didn't include above)  <br /> <br />Overall, I would rate the songs: 4.348  <br /> <br />Fijacion Oral, Volume 1: CD:  <br />Great packaging for the CD/DVD version of the album. The inside contains one disc (\\"This Side Up\\" is the CD with the DVD material on the back). The reading material includes a poster of her, and the lyrics to the songs (in Spanish). Overall I would rate the packaging: 4.80  <br /> <br />Fijacion Oral, Volume 1: DVD:  <br />DVD included a great music video of \\"La Tortura\\" an interview with Alejandro Sanz (guest artist on \\"La Tortura\\" and co-writer of the song) and a making of feature. Overall, I would rate the DVD: 4.34 <br />-Michael S. Briggs-  <br />(A version of this review appears on Epinions.com)
B00003CX9W|5.0|Fantasia is a film that has stood the test of time thanks to its originality and the magic that is Disney. Unlike most movies, this one has no story to follow. Instead what we have is vignettes of Disney animation set to some of the best classical music to be found, played by the Philharmonic Orchestra (conducted by the renowned Leopold Stokowski).<br /><br />The film begins with Bach's Toccata and Fugue being played to a backdrop of kaleidoscopic images. There are no real forms to see, just random moving images that fit the music perfectly. The second segment uses more `classical' animation, and shows fairies, fish, and flowers, and so on through the changing seasons. This section has Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker suite as its theme. Particularly good is the `Chinese Dance' featuring dancing toadstools.<br /><br />Segment three is the best known by far, Mickey Mouse as the sorcerer's apprentice which is set to Paul Duka's music of the same name. Here we see the famous cartoon of Mickey trying to use magic on brooms in order to lighten his work load only for it all to go disastrously wrong as the brooms run out of control. From here, the film moves on to `Rites of Spring', by Stravinsky, and this animation shows evolution, from the beginning of the universe through to the extinction of the dinosaurs.<br /><br />There is then a short `respite' in the form of `The soundtrack', a thin beam of light that changes pattern as the music alters of the instrument playing changes. Soon the movie is back in full flow with Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony set to idyllic country images, complete with cherubs, unicorns and centaurs. This section includes a dramatic scene of a thunderstorm complete with the god Vulcan hurling his lightening bolts.<br /><br />Segment six has the wonderful ostrich and hippo ballets, who wouldn't laugh at the sight of an alligator trying to run off with the hippo he has `fallen' for. All of this is played out to Ponchielli's `Dance of the Hours'. Finally we end up with the dramatic `Night on a Bald Mountain' (Mussorgsky) which depicts evil being celebrated during the witches Sabbath. This section is actually divided into two and in the second half we hear the beautiful, haunting Ave Maria (Schubert) and see pilgrims crossing a bridge into a picturesque meadow. The image is one of good triumphing over evil.<br /><br />This is a truly magical film, matched only by Fantasia 2000, and one that should be in any film/music lovers' collection.tic `Night on a Bald Mountain' (Mussorgsky) which depicts evil being celebrated during the witches Sabbath.

B000000OTU|4.0|Aerosmith are one of the greatest Rock 'N' Roll bands of all time, no questions asked. They had it going on the 70s-late 90s. And this compliation, Big Ones, is an overview of the late 80s-early 90s. Read on for my review.<br /><br />Now, this isn't quite the best Aerosmith hits compliation, that honor would go to O Yeah! Aerosmith Hits. But, it was a great overview of the 80s-90s. Read on for my pros and cons section.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />-ALL THE BIG HITS FROM THE LATE '80S-EARLY '90S ARE HERE. You get classics you know and love from this era like Dude (Looks Like A Lady), Janie's Got A Gun, Cryin', The Other Side, Angel, Livin' On the Edge, etc.<br /><br />-YOU GET TWO UNRELEASED SONGS. This duo of a new set of songs include Deuces Are Wild from the Beavis And Butthead soundtrack and Blind Man. Completists may want to buy Big Ones just for these 2 songs!<br /><br />-EVEN IF NOT IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER, THE TRACKLIST ORDER IS GREAT. They decided to put the shorter songs for the first half and the longer songs for the second half, which is GREAT.<br /><br />-THE ALBUM COVER IS NICE. Well, this is sort-of off topic for the review, but I decided to put it as an extra. Tehee.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />-EVEN THOUGH THE COMPLIATION HAS ENOUGH SONGS, A COUPLE MORE WOULD'VE BEEN BETTER. Songs like F.I.N.E. and The Fever would've been nice additions.<br /><br />-NO TRACKS FROM DONE WITH MIRRORS AND ROCK IN A HARD PLACE. Yes, I know these albums were total commercial failures, but 1 song from each would've made this compliation more perfect.<br /><br />That's all I have to say for now for the cons & pros. I reccomend this compliation to anyone who loves Aerosmith in the '80s & '90s. They made a great overview of that era, but we know that the '70s are better, so they decided to make a double-disc compliation called O Yeah! Ultimate Aerosmith Hits to give an overview of all their stages in their career. Anyway, buy Big Ones if you're a casual fan of the '80s & '90s Aerosmith!!

B0006L16N8|5.0|Well Coldplay has really caught on to the fact that they are really good at composing music.  They really worked hard on writing beautiful melodies for each of the tracks and it shows.  This album has more good songs on it than each of their previous efforts.  After hearing 'Speed of Sound' on the radio and already having respect for the band I bought this album knowing it would be good. I didn't expect it to have as many good songs as it did.  The previous albums had a few disappointments, but not this one.  Each one is a good listen and a few contain some of the most beautiful melodies the band has ever written.  \\"Fix You\\", for example, is a really gorgeous song to listen to.  Plus \\"The Hardest Part\\" got stuck in my head easily and could be their best song to date.  This album is really, really good with many of the tracks (not just one) getting stuck in my head quite often.  The only tracks that I skip are \\"X&Y\\" and \\"Twisted Logic\\", but even these songs are tolerable as compared to the other albums.  The previous albums had songs that were not tolerable.  If you like Coldplay's previous work like \\"Yellow\\", \\"In My Place\\", \\"Don't Panic\\", \\"Scientist\\", and \\"Clocks\\" then this album is a must have.  This album is at the same quality as those songs and shows that Coldplay has improved their composing ability.
B0000039PW|5.0|ready to die is the best cd ever releaced by any rap artist. The combination of slow and understandable flowing and the nice beats make this the absolute best. With the songs the what, warning, things done changed, big pappa, juicy makes this a classic. No, matter fact every song on there is a good song, even the skits are kinda entertaining. So if your a fan of 2pac, you have to get this cd at all costs. It is the best!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I've never written a review before and I've not seen the play. After renting the movie and watching it 3 times in 2 days I went out and bought it and the soundtrack. What a beautiful and sad story. Gerard Butler is soooo sexy, he's sensual and totally portrays a very sad and hurt phantom. Emmy Rossum is a beautiful and talented young singer who will, I'm sure be well on her way to more and great things. Some reviewers put down her voice but after all she was supposed to be just what she is and she portrayed it beautifully. Of course her voice is light and sweet, she doesn't have the years of singing and straining to make it sound mature which would not be very fitting in her part. Patrick Wilson, however, is another story. His voice was weak and his acting was weak. Back to the phantom, his expression of his feelings in his voice could not have been better and is he ever a hunk. If I was Christine I would have let Raoul go and stayed with that gorgeous hunk of phantom. His eyes through the mask said so much and even without the mask he was sexy, sensual and a big WOW. The costumes were gorgeous, reminded me of the musicals of years ago that we no longer see. The story was funny in parts (Minnie Driver was superb), sad at times and brought tears to my eyes. I could and will watch it again and again. The soundtrack sounds wonderful in my car as I drive down the road and everyone around me can enjoy the Phantom of the Opera, (whether they want to or not) I can only say that since I've never seen the play, and I'm glad I haven't), I can't and don't want to compare it. I will let this movie stand on it's own and it can and do a good job of it.
1400034779|4.0|It is hilariously funny, a delightful feel good book about life in Botswana. I am sure most people may not even know where Botswana is.<br /><br />Mma \\"Precious\\" Ramotswe  had a rotten marriage, lost an infant and then her father, disasters which could send any one to an asylum. But she rebounds and instead of getting a routine job or opt for a run of the mill business, opens a detective agency in a rural town. She has an office, a secretary, a typewriter and a small white van and is open for business.<br /><br /> Holmes and Poirot would be proud of her technique in solving her client's problems.  Only characters missing are Dr. Watson and Captain Hastings.  Mma Ramotswe ploughs ahead with uncanny insight in solving all her client's foibles, sometimes ending up as a victim of her own making. There is a missing boy caper which meanders through out the book with black magic thrown in for good measure.<br /><br /> I wonder why women don't start a similar venture here in the good old USA. It could become a booming business as we have our share of the same problems which M solved in Botswana,  missing children, philandering husbands, stolen cars, concerned fathers about their daughters, stolen identities, corrupt officials to name a few.
B00079HZUM|4.0|As a general rule, I try to avoid movies featuring men dressed as women.  In the case of Stage Beauty, though, the cross-dressing is built upon the historic foundation of male-only performers in the 17th century London theatre.  Claire Danes sweetened the pot enough for me to seek this movie out.  I can't say I'm all that enamored with the film, though.  It is sort of artsy, the kind of movie that makes you feel like you're supposed to adore it - but I just don't.  Billy Crudup turned in a brave, amazing performance, but the story didn't completely click for me, and - I hate to say it - Claire Danes' performance came up a little short, as her character seemed to lack depth.  Then there's the whole chemistry thing - basically, there isn't much of it to be found between Crudup and Danes, making the romantic angle of the story sort of weird and confusing.<br /><br />As we all know, there was a time centuries ago when women were prohibited from performing on stage; instead, men played all the female characters.  Here, Ned Kynaston (Crudup) is the most acclaimed \\"female\\" actor in 17th-century London, bringing the house down in roles such as Othello's Desdemona.  Claire Danes plays his dresser, Maria.  She studies his every move onstage and secretly performs the role herself at a nearby tavern.  Kynaston finds out about Maria's acting debut at a royal dinner, but his attempt to cast calumny upon it backfires when King Charles decides to allow women to perform.  Kynaston is necessarily a little unhappy about this, and he flat-out refuses to perform with Maria or any other woman onstage.  Charles' little minx of a mistress soon talks (well, it's not really talking, but it does involve her mouth) the king into forbidding men to play female parts altogether.  The celebrated Kynaston, \\"queen\\" of the London stage, is now without a job; to make matters worse, he's given a thorough thrashing by Maria's supporters.  Kynaston, unwilling to play a male role, soon hits bottom - and it's really not pretty.  Maria has a few problems of her own, as well; as celebrated as she is as the first woman of the London stage, she's not really a very good actress.  Might it be that Maria and Kynaston need each other in order to find success and happiness?<br /><br />This movie is really all about Billy Crudup and his character.  There's one particularly poignant scene wherein Kynaston tries to show how easy it is to play a man - and fails miserably.  Kynaston doesn't want to play men because there's no art involved in it, nor is there any beauty.  He doesn't want to let the beauty die.  He has spent years training for his profession, knows more about being a woman that Maria does, and feels utterly betrayed.  It's a surprisingly powerful, emotional argument that gives the film a depth that nothing and no one else was able to supply.  Of course, the most powerful scene comes at the very end, sending the movie out on a high note indeed.<br /><br />Crudup is rather disturbingly feminine in his female guise; Danes, in contrast, is somewhat manly in terms of her actions and motivations.  I never understood the feelings between their two characters; there's some kind of romantic flame winking in and out somewhere, but Maria is far too unfeeling early on to make whatever passion comes later believable to me.  Anyone with a heart would take pity on the guy when he loses everything he cares about.<br /><br />I should mention that Stage Beauty is surprisingly risqu&eacute; on several occasions - what with Kynaston having to convince a couple of admirers that he is in fact a gentleman, a lecherous courtier making advances on Kynaston in female guise, and a perverted king (and let me say, I hope I never again see a \\"king\\" dressed as a woman).  There's only a modest amount of nudity, however (including one quick, slightly revealing shot of Claire Danes).  There is also, I should mention, a kissing scene without any females in attendance - not my favorite scene.<br /><br/>In the end, my slight sense of disappointment with this film seems to come down to Claire Danes' performance.  There just wasn't much depth there until the very end.  I'm all in favor of women playing women, but I wasn't even sympathetic to Maria's cause.  It's still a good movie, but I just think it could have been better.  It's worth seeing, however, for Billy Crudup's tour de force performance, if nothing else.> <br />In the end, my slight sense of disappointment with this film seems to come down to Claire Danes' performance.

B0009AM5JA|3.0|A competent, yet uninspired new disc from Coldplay.  They have definitely crossed that creative line into the MOR (&quot;middle of the road&quot;) this time.   Hopefully, it is only a temporary swerve than permanent direction... <br />It certainly fits that I heard their song, The Speed of Sound over the PA system as I was picking up a couple items at the local supermarket...  URGH!<br />Cheers

B0000041CZ|5.0|We have even more variety of pacing and mood than his Book 1.    Gulda's sense of momentum is gorgeous. Yet in the C Minor he is so slow. Is he turning this thrilling prelude to mush? As one of the greatest pianists of the century and a great interpreter, his emphasis on the bass line is so solid and you can almost feel those demons in your breaths. A great artist is someone who is not just able to turn a work inside out, but in some cases also upside down, yet coming up with something as good or even better than the original. Sure, Dohnanyi (the conductor/ pianist) was one, Richter another, and Gulda too.      This is a very fine and distinctive Bach at very attractive price, almost a windfall. Highly recommended for those who would turn to WTC often, those who need to have a deeper understanding of, and those who desire to have some more insights into and inspirations from these pieces.
B00005JLPK|5.0|Frida Kahlo's surrealistic portraits are artfully intertwined with and poignantly underscore the most significant milestones of the painter's short but colorful life. Salma Hayek's moving portrayal of the half Mexican, half Jewish Frida captivated me throughout the film.  <br /> <br />The original score had a mesmerizing quality to it that meshed so well with the sheer visual beauty of many of the scenes, particularly in the beginning of the film where we see a teenage Frieda in the early 20's with her male companions, running to spy on Diego as he paints a nude model in the school auditorium, and towards the end when we hear \\"Burn it Blue\\" as Frida lies dying in her bed. <br /> <br />The supporting cast, particularly Alfred Molina as Diego Rivera and Roger Rees as  Guillermo Kahlo (who most Cheers fans will never recognize as the snooty millionaire Robin Colcord) are wonderful. I thought the movie was a beautifully executed work of art in itself.  <br />
0307165485|5.0|I had this book as a child, and have many memories of the stories inside. I bought this book for my own son, born just a few weeks ago. I still have my copy of this book, but it has too much wear and tear now to stand up to another generation of avid reading. It is simple for children to understand, with great stories, poems, words and illustrations. This is a must for any child's library!
B00005JL7Q|5.0|I've watched this movie more than any other in my DVD library. The unlikely story of how an independently wealthy and shallow guy in his late 30s living a pointless existence (Hugh Grant) hooks up with a dorky (but not at all sickening) twelve year old boy and the way their offbeat relationship flourishes is endlessly charming.  <br /> <br />There's nothing preachy, saccharine, or depressing in the movie, despite the fact that the kid's mother (played by the gifted actress Toni Colette) tries to commit suicide at one point and the kid performs Roberta Flack's \\"Killing Me Softly\\" to a hostile audience of rowdy teens.. I hate to use the word \\"heartwarming\\", but darned if it isn't. It's one of those movies you will want to see again.
B0009K7ROI|3.0|I love John Mayall. I bought his Turning Point cassette in 1970 and still listen to it. I've seen him perform two different years at the Grand Emporium blues club in Kansas City. I have many of his CDs. <br />This is not one of his better CDs. He spends too much time on his lyrics and not enough on the melodies. He sings on and on about his life and the sorry state of the world but where's the band? Longtime fans may enjoy \\"Road Dogs\\" because it his latest release but if you are new to John Mayall first watch his 70th birthday concert DVD with good home theater speakers.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|The classic horror fiends of yesteryear unite in the 2004 film \\"Van Helsing\\".  Starring Hugh Jackman as the title character, Gabriel Van Helsing, the film also includes Kate Beckinsale (\\"Pearl Harbor\\" and \\"Underworld\\") and David Wenham (\\"Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\\" and \\"Return of the King\\") as his allies in the attempt to stop Dracula's dastardly plans.  Despite some minor drawbacks, \\"Van Helsing\\" is a fun, action packed flick that spans a variety of film genres. <br /> <br />It's Transylvania in the late 1800s and Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) has acquired the services of Dr. Victor Frankenstein (Samuel West) to produce a creature.  The plan?  The Frankenstein monster (Shuler Hensley) will help bring life to  Dracula's and his three bride's offspring.  However, things go awry when the local townspeople burn a windmill that the creature has escaped to. <br /> <br />Enter Van Helsing who has been sent to Paris to capture Mr. Hyde (voice of Robbie Coltrane) and is accused of murdering him.  Vatican City, which has been harboring Van Helsing, orders him on a trip to Transylvania with a friar, Carl (Wenham).  With the aide of Carl's various gadgets, the pair's mission is to stop Dracula while protecting Anna Valerious (Beckinsale), who's the only chance her family has from spending an eternity in purgatory. <br /> <br />Van Helsing and company have the odds stacked against them.  Not only do they have the unenviable task of battling Dracula and his brides, but there's also Igor (Kevin O'Connor), a protg of Dr. Frankenstein's, and the Wolfman (Will Kemp) to contend with.  However, Van Helsing, Anna and Carl are able to befriend a most unusual ally. <br /> <br />There are many good things to point out about \\"Van Helsing\\".  Nobody likes a long, drawn out movie.  \\"Van Helsing\\" isn't one of these.  The film is fast paced and doesn't allow for many dull moments.  Whether it's one of the many action sequences or a simple conversation between the characters, the movie andthe storyline keep moving. <br /> <br />While the entire cast was a great ensemble, there were a few standout performances.  David Wenham adds some comedic relief as the apprehensive and timid friar turned sidekick who eventually comes into his own.  Also, Shuler Hensley cast Frankenstein's monster in a more different light than we are used to seeing.  This was a nice and classic touch. <br /> <br />Another plus for \\"Van Helsing\\" was the title character.  There have been many movies that have portrayed Van Helsing as an elderly Vampire killer.  For once, moviegoers get to see Van Helsing's earlier days and even get to know the character's background. <br /> <br />Despite being an entertaining movie, there are a couple of distractions.  While Richard Roxburgh was a good Dracula, the character didn't come across as evil as he could have been.  In the movie, Dracula is supposed to be the main villain, however, in some scenes, he comes across as comedic.  The same holds true with Dracula's three brides.  For vicious, blood drinking sirens, they often come across as whiney. <br /> <br />The very end of the movie also serves as a drawback.  The battle beforehand provides an exciting turn of events.  However, the scene afterwards, with the sky and the clouds, seems almost anticlimactic.   <br /> <br />\\"Van Helsing\\" seems to include a little bit of everything.  Any moviegoer who likes action, drama, horror, comedy and even a touch of romance will thoroughly enjoy the movie. <br /> <br />
B0006L16N8|2.0|I was reasonably confident that after playing X&Y a couple dozen times it would win me over. I was wrong. It's hard to be won over by an album that basically consists of 2 songs being played over and over again but the words are different and Chris Martin adds an \\"Ahhh\\" and an \\"Ohhhh\\" in different places. No, seriously, they all sound the same. A handful of them just start out with Mr. Martin doing his harrowing emoting. <br /> <br />I am utterly disappointed. I am not sure what I expected but it wasn't this. Ok, in all fairness, there are a few bright spots. Speed of Sound sounds like the most likely candidate to beat me over the head and make me love it. Square One is my favorite because I could see it keeping me awake at night as it churns over and over in my head. What if is pleasing to the air but as I play it John Lennon is rolling over in his grave. U2 might want to consider legal action as well. Imitation is part of this business but at least make the lyrics have depth and meaning like the originals that obviously inspired the songs. <br /> <br />I just got this sense that they were trying too hard to please with this album. That's always a mistake. It's like when you're teaching a kid to hit a baseball, their first instinct is to grip the bat too tight. All that does is slow down the bat speed. These guys are trying too hard to hold on to the mainstream that they forgot their own stream.
0385513755|3.0|Let me start off by saying that I read the plain hardcover version of \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" but this website, for some reason, has not accepted any reviews written after May 29, 2005.  An illustrated version sounds like a good idea, and I will browse through one as soon as I spot it in the bookstore.<br /><br />On my last vacation, I noticed that half the crowd was reading one Dan Brown book or another, so I decided to get on board by reading \\"Angels and Demons\\" followed by the \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" which both chronicle the adventures of Robert Langdon, part Harvard Professor symbologist (with a sub-specialty in secret societies), and part Indiana Jones.  The beautiful, lithe and brilliant Vittoria of \\"Angels\\" is now replaced by the equally beautiful, lithe and brilliant Sophie Neveu, top-rate French criminologist.  The books both follow the same basic formula: plenty of cliff-hangers, good guys who are really bad, and suspicious ornery guys who are really good.<br /><br />In short, in \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" an albino monk, a member of Opus Dei -- a secret Catholic offshoot where the leaders flog themselves and wear barbed wire anklets (I realize there's more to it than that)-- has been ordered by the \\"Teacher\\" to murder the top members of the Priory of Scion, another secret society, which alone holds the key to the real history of Jesus' life and early Christianity.  Its military branch, Knights Templar, now long defunct, has hidden the Holy Grail, which is not a chalice (or cup of any sort) but rather secret documents revealing the importance of Mary Magdalene in the Jesus story.  Before he is murdered, The most important member of the Priory, Jacques Sauniere (Sophie's grandfather who raised her after the death of her parents) leaves clues for Sophie and Robert to find the Grail, so that the \\"true\\" story of Jesus might not be lost.  Some of these clues are revealed in the greatest works of Leonardo Da Vinci, who himself was once the top dog of the Priory (hence the title of the book).  Sophie hasn't spoken to her poor grandfather in years, after she observed him taking part in a Paganistic ritual, symbolically \\"joining\\" Father and Mother Earth.  Other, more thinly drawn characters also figure into the plot.  As in \\"Angels,\\" the chapters are short, most ending in a cliff-hanger or a surprising revelation.  Pages are turned quickly as the reader races to reach a resolution.  I guessed the identity of the Teacher early on, not because I'm particularly insightful, but because I think I understand how Brown creates plot (actually, later in the book, I changed my mind about the Teacher's identity, having been misled by the private thoughts of a character who actually knew who he was, which I felt was somewhat dishonest on the author's part).<br /><br />Dan Brown is a fairly proficient thriller writer.  What makes him so popular, I believe, is that he tackles big and provocative issues such as the \\"true\\" life and teachings of Jesus, the nature of the Vatican and Catholicism, and world-wide conspiracies led by super secret societies.  Just from browsing the other day in a book store, I think it's obvious that other writers will now attempt to copy Brown by dealing with these subjects as well.<br /><br />In conducting some research on some of the claims in \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" I learned that Brown often relies on questionable unscholarly sources.  For instance, although most scholars agree that the figure to the immediate right of Jesus in Da Vinci's \\"Last Supper\\" is the Apostle John, Brown claims it's definitely Mary Magdalene, relying on sources who come up with their \\"theories\\" largely on pure speculation.  It's certainly interesting, but what is it really based on?  At one point, the book claims that, in a three hundred year period, the Catholic Church put to death five million women, by burning them at the stake, for being guilty of one kind of heresy or another.  Shouldn't a highly disturbing and controversial claim like this be thoroughly documented?  It's my understanding that this number is probably wildly inflated (although, for certain, any number is unacceptable).<br /><br />As a non-Christian, I agree with Brown's assessment that there seems to be a profound disconnect between the teachings of Jesus according to the New Testament (i.e. anti-accumulation of wealth, forgive the sinner, turn the other cheek) as compared with the later practices of the Catholic Church, especially during Medieval times.  Brown's overall theme seems to be that women were considered far more important in early Christianity (as influence by Paganism) which later developed into a male-dominated religion that subjugated women.  However, many cultures and religions throughout history have, unfortunately, subjugated women, including various forms of \\"Paganism.\\"<br /><br />In the end, I appreciate that \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" has made me think about these issues.  The problem is the slew of books that will follow by less talented writers who re-interpret some major religion or piece of history without any factual basis, or claim some massive conspiracy by some secret society that has little influence in the real world.derstanding that this number is probably wildly inflated (although, for certain, any number is unacceptable).

B00023BLXK|5.0|I thought that this movie was very well written, and I think it accurately grasped a lot of the issues that went on, in Cuba at that time. Some of these issues a lot of people have not really known too much. I also loved the Latin music!!!! Being West Indian/American, I grew up around a lot of Latin music. I am also in an interracial relationship with a Caucasian guy who is Irish American, and I thihnk that I could relate to some of that as well, especially the looks that you get, introducing your culture to each other, and that sort of thing. I think that some people might not like the movie too much because, they maybe cant relate to some of the issues. But, on a personal note, I really thought that this movie was one of my favorites.

B000002H33|5.0|This is not only the best Metallica album but one of the best metal albums of all time.  I'm tired of these stupid 10 year olds saying this isn't metal.  They don't know what metal is.  This is metal and damn good metal at that.  Go listen to your sissy Linkin Park.  If you're into real metal I suggest you go buy this album.  This is the last album with one of the greatest bassits of all time, Cliff Lee Burton.  This is truly a landmark in metal history and a must have if you are a Metallica fan or just a plain metalhead.
B00004RJ74|5.0|Directed by Robert Rodriguez and written by Quentin Tarantino (who also co-stars) From Dusk til Dawn is a unique movie combining the gritty and crime drama of Tarantino's pulp fiction and splatter on a horror background of vampire bikers and strippers.  George Clooney and Tarantino are Seth and Richard Gecko, brothers and career criminals who flee to Mexico after killing a cop and convenience store employee in a memorable shootout as they blast liquor bottles over the armed clerk and light a roll of toilet paper on fire and toss it at the man.<br /><br />Dumping their getaway car they hijack the RV of Jacob Fuller(Harvey Keitel), a former minister who has lost his way and is travelling with his daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis) and son Scott (Ernest Liu).  They make their way to Mexico to a strip club in the middle of nowhere where the Gecko's plan to meet an associate.  The bar is for bikers and truckers only and includes people like Frost (Fred Williamson) Sex Machine (make-up guru Tom Savini) and consumate bad guy Danny Trejo playing the bartender.  Cheech Marin actually plays three different roles in the film as well.<br /><br />The group soon learns that the entertainment, including highlight act Santanico Pandemonium (Selma Hayek) are vampires and now the small group find themselves in a life or death struggle to survive until the sun rises.  As you might expect from a Tarantino story there is liberal violence and loads of humor.  In one part the survivors are trying to remember what weapons work on vampires.  Sex machine keeps saying that he thinks silver can work and others argue that it's only on werewolves.  Kate is quick to point out that since no one has any silver anyway, that they should just forget it.<br /><br />It's about as gruesome a vampire film as you will ever see with decapitations, limbs being torn off, throats ripped out, and blood spurting like a fountain.  It's not scary per se, but it is a wild and exhilarating ride with enjoyable performances by all, excellent make-up and effects and loads of action.  The sequels pale next to this original.  The great DVD release comes with deleted scenes, featurettes, and commentary by Rodriguez and Tarantino.  A 90's horror classic!ormances by all, excellent make-up and effects and loads of action.

B0009AM5JA|2.0|not to say that coldplay isn't awesome, but their latest album had me confused. after listening to the album on the bus and while walking, i felt as though i was listening to elevator background music, which is something i didn't expect to feel like while listening to coldplay. but anyways, definitely one to pick up if you like coldplay, however, newcomers should buy earlier stuff.

B00005JNJT|2.0|Batman Begins is not better than Tim Burtons 1989 epic.  One reason is that this movie takes its self to seriously, There is no sence of adveture or fun.  Batman begins may have taken what was missing frrom the old movies but he forgot to give us the colors, the fun dialoge and the joy of Batman here we have a scary, dark drama.  I perfer the first two
B00000AOUD|5.0|Thick As A Brick is a masterpiece. It transcends the rock and art-rock genre, and frankly it's genre is irrelevant. It's simply a great piece of music. I'm certain that recognition of this work will only grow with time.
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|left ball. Has anyone here ever listened to progressive metal? Brainstorm , Pagans Mind, Symphony X, those bands play real music that is technical and not as sporatic and its good music. Hell listen to Meshuggah over this crap.
0375713751|5.0|This is one of my favorite books in this genre. <br />The protagonist is angaging and smart. <br />The writing is witty and clever. <br />The pages turn fast. <br />For any reviewer who is looking at this as a \\"feminist\\" work, perhaps they should stick to Paglia and Steinhem. <br />
B00005JNJT|4.0|Batman Begins is a very good action movie, with a decent plot. This is probably the most true to the current comic Batman any of the movies has gotten and Bale is the best Batman since Michael Keaton, possibly even better than Keaton but I think it's too early to make that call (we'll see what he does in the sequel).<br /><br />About 30% of the movie tells the origin of Batman. On screen, in the past we've seen why Batman became Batman. In this movie we finally learn how that all came about and it's adapted well from the comic origin written years ago. I've read some reviews that claim \\"this is the best comic movie to date\\" or \\"this is one you can actually believe could happen\\", both comments are ridiculous, this is most definately a comic book movie, while Batman doesn't have super powers, he never has in any of his on screen personas.<br /><br />I gave it four stars because it's a very entertaining movie, that manages to take an exhausted franchise and bring it back to life in a big way for yet another generation. Staying inside the comic movie genre; while it didn't deliver the same emotional intensity as Spiderman II, Batman Begins is certainly is a very good movie with quite a few unexpected twist and turns, among the best of the comic movies ever made.
B00005JNJT|5.0|While I'm definitely a fan of Tim Burton's interpretation and a decided enemy of Schumacher's deconstruction into campy gaudiness, I must say that Batman Begins delves into a construction that I'm 100% on board with.<br /><br />Tim Burton delved very much into duality and splitting his character in half.  Christopher Nolan cleverly directs and interprets Batman as one whole person...one WHOLE HUMAN BEING.<br /><br />That's right, folks.  Let's not forget this - he's a human being; seeing Batman as actually someone who is traumatized and vulnerable not only works well, but is chillingly believable.<br /><br />Push aside any of the far-fetched ideas and try to imagine crafting a story about a human being taking on villainy, and you'll see how this film is clever and emotional at the same time.  I especially love seeing how Batman himself gets developed along with the gadgetry.<br /><br />True, the love interest is extremely muted, but it certainly acts as an excellent foil for Bruce's personality to be reflected upon and it's certainly NOT what this film is about.<br /><br />Don't complain about \\"slow starts.\\"  This is plot and character development at its finest in a Hollywood atmosphere that has almost forgotten both.<br /><br />Many kudos to Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale for finally rescuing Batman!!!!  My hat's off to you both.<br /><br />PS - the new Batmobile rocks!!
B00097A5I6|5.0|My husband is a long-time fan of Oasis and I have never been.  Last week we purchased the new Coldplay, the new Gorillaz and the new Oasis.  Don't Believe the Truth blows the other two albums away.  I never thought I'd say it, but this Oasis album is really good.  For once Oasis has made an album where each song has a personality.  I've felt that their earlier albums had a hard time keeping the listener's attention because each song blended in with the next.  With Don't Believe the Truth, Oasis makes music that sounds like they have been influenced by artists other than Oasis and the Beatles.  I hear some Billy Bragg and even touches of Radiohead influence.  This album came out at the perfect time.  It's light, interesting and sunny.  Perfect for listening to while driving to the beach.
B0008KLVG4|4.0|Regardless of whether or not you are upset about this new edition coming five years after the last (which seems perfectly reasonable to me considering there are a lot more DVD players now than there were in 2000), \\"Jaws\\" will remain an amazing, classic movie with plenty of historical firsts.  The first summer blockbuster;  the first movie that used a handheld camera for just about every shot;  the first movie that relied almost completely on complicated mechanical contraptions for the main protagonist;  the first movie filmed on Martha's Vineyard;  the first movie that elevated ADL into a bonafide career move (well-known character actors were used for the background dialogue looping, like Howard Hesseman, Harry Shearer, Michael McKean and David L. Lander). And other than the three starring and two supporting roles, it used a cast of unknowns, mostly islanders.<br /><br />I'm unsure if anyone's mentioned this already, but one of the likely catalysts for the new edition may have been the highly successful \\"JawsFest `05\\" held on the Vineyard a week and a half ago.  (Which came first, the edition or the festival? Probably the festival- which earned a big blessing from Universal.  They provided all the equipment for a huge outdoor screening.)  It was an incredible opportunity to find out about all facets of the making of this classic and to meet the production people involved, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  In their review of \\"JawsFest `05\\", the LA Times reported that movie festivals and other related splashy events are becoming the new way that studios are releasing (and re-releasing) their product.<br /><br />Back to the 2 disc set: the nine minute UK interview with Spielberg, taped on the second day of what would become a much longer and way over budget shooting schedule, shows a director still at ease before all hell would be breaking loose shortly thereafter.  Although it is short, it's very interesting to hard core Jaws fans. The 60 page booklet has a lot of behindthe scenes photos I hadn't seen before.  There are a few bits of additional deleted scenes and outtakes which have been added to what we got five years ago.  It is nice to have the complete two hour \\"making of\\" documentary now.  As for the movie, having three audio mixes is fabulous.  The DTS is very special, but the purist in me really enjoyed the mono from the good ole days of 1975 when I first saw the film.<br /><br />It's up to you if you want to upgrade to the 30th Anniversary edition.  For me, the multiple audio choices made it a no-brainer.
0375422889|5.0|This story of survival, resiliency, and hope is honest and humourous.  The book also deals with hard choices-will she stay in Iran with her family, or return to the West where there is more personal freedom?  The author captures the awkwardness and soul searching of the teen and early adulthood years.  I highly recommend this book.
B000002H97|4.0|This album is a little more commercial if that's how you want to say it, but its basically just slower and a tad simpler which /does/ make it more accessible for new fans. <br />But its still a great cd it's definately easier to listen to than previous releases yet still can be considered thrash which is why I think this is Metallica's best cd, they changed for the better without totally 'selling out'. <br />I'm not that big of a fan but if you want some 'real' metal that's fairly recent pick this up, you won't regret.
B0007TKNL0|2.0|This movie let me down. I watched it more than once, liking it a little bit at first but then I couldn't handle the tweeks and alterations.  As a result, it seemed to get worse with each viewing.  The little differences just became too annoying to cope with.  I found myself enjoying the movie because I loved the play, not because I actually liked the movie.  I was continuously finding things worth changing and imagining parts that the movie never properly expressed.     Faults:    1. The phantom... not what I expected.  The guy is young, \\"GQ\\" and ridiculous.  Why not cast Fabio while they were are at it?  Feels like watching a cheesy romance novel put to film.  Phantom should be older, wiser, uglier - quite frankly.  His beauty is his talent, not his face.  The whole point is that he could woe Christine with his art alone, that music was enough to make her love him. Think Beauty and the Beast, with a tragic ending.  2. The phantom sword fight...  why?  Was the story too dull for Hollywood?  Not enough action?  ...And if you are going to have the phantom fight, then make him win.  By making him lose, it destroys the rest of the story.  How can you be concerned about Raoul entering the dungeon beneath the opera house, when he has already proven he is the better fighter, when he has already conquered his enemy?  Not to mention the fact that it just makes the phantom look like a weakling.  3. The actors show no real emotion... something very odd about it.  They appear stale, showing no conviction to match the wonderful singing.  Much better just to close your eyes and hear the music.  4. What's with the story behind the phantom?  A kid on display at some freak show?  Not happy with that background info.  The phantom loses his mystery and his power, becoming a pathetic child to sympathize with for the wrong reasons.    The good:  1. The music - although... there are some slight differences here and there in the song structures that again make me ask, \\"why??\\"    Listen tothe original recording of the music and remember the dark, edgy story that is taking place... sadly, I feel the magic is lost in this movie adaptation.  People have remarked on how beautiful the sets are... well, there is a problem with that, too.  I feel like I am watching plastic people in a plastic world.  A real gothic touch would be to show some more realism, and not just a polished and shiny package of \\"pretty\\" material.  It could have been darker, including the masquerade, which was kind of a let down...  There was a real chance to show a fantastic display.  Instead, everyone was wearing practically the same mask, with little imagination and fantasy present.    A straight filming of the play itself, void of director's presence and alterations would be the ideal thing.  It would be like front row seats.  Bottom line, the play blows this movie out of the water and those who have never seen the play, and base their opinion of The Phantom of the Opera on this movie alone, are missing something very special.
6305922748|3.0|I love \\"This is Spinal Tap\\". However, one has to try to be objective. While the portrayal of a hardrock band on it's way down (IF they don't make it in, say Japan, that is...) is hilarious, as a movie the film has a serious flaw. There is virtually no story. It's are not going anywhere (Japan is not counting), it's more a series of funny sketches and songs. <br /> <br />Having said that, there are many many good things in this film. Like when the band sits and listens to reviews that have been written about their albums. How did they come up with all those stupid album titles? They sound just like something a heavy metal band would come up wi... ah, right. \\"IntraVenus de Milo\\", for example. And of course, \\"The Gospel According to Spinal Tap\\", that is accompanied by an appropriate review: \\"These prentetious Rock Psalms make you wonder on which day the Lord created Spinal Tap, and if He couldn't have rested on that day too.\\" The band actually appreciates that review. <br /> <br />Great lyrics to all the songs, too. You can tell that the movie makers love hard rock music as they make fun of the clichs. Clumsy lyrics about sex (\\"Big Bottom\\" and \\"Sex Farm\\"), a song about the 'mysterious' Stonehenge, and my personal favourite \\"Rock and Roll Creation\\" that mixes concepts from different religions with secular origin science and turns it all into a song about... well, Rock and Roll. <br /> <br />\\"Twas the rock and roll creation <br />Twas a terrible big bang <br />Twas the ultimate mutation <br />Ying was searching for his yang <br />And he looked and he saw that it was good.\\" <br /> <br />That's just ingenious.  <br /> <br />Still, the problem is that with no overall direction for the story (there is no murder to be solved, no love to be found, and even the album is already recorded) makes the film a little bit tiresome to watch. Possibly the gags would have worked better if presented separated in a TV-show, so you don't get too much of the same at once. In \\"The Office\\", we have the unhappy love situation (among other things) that ties the show together. Here we have a series of great sketches and songs, that are of course related to each other, but not going anywhere. Oops, I've already said that. See, that's what I mean. It's the same.  <br /> <br />But it's fun. The music actually rocks. Great parts that are larger than the whole. And look out for Billy Crystal as a mimer.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Whoever has seen the trailer of Fight Club will think that knows what it is about: a bunch of bored masochistic men that almost kill each other to prove they're alive. Ah, and stars Edward Norton and Brad Pitt.<br /><br />Truth is, that's only part of the package.<br /><br />Fight Club is a dark and nihilistic saga about the life of average men, at the brink of a new century. A right -or left- hook through the solar plexus of movie goers. A wake-up call to reality.<br /><br />Norton serves as an anonymous narrator; he's an average Joe, with a mindless job, drown in boredom, hungry for status and motivation; until he meets Tyler Durhem, a rebel soul that lives to impress others.<br /><br />Everything in Tyler is unusual: his wardrobe, his shameful way of saying things, his eagerness to look for fights. It doesn't take much time to lure the narrator to one of his fights and found The Fight Club, where the prerequisite to belong is to not speak of fight club.<br /><br />The intern fights are not enough, the pranks emerge. One step at a time, the club prepares to a bigger goal: massive destruction. And Tyler's and the narrator's relationship get fishy.<br /><br />Norton and Pitt throw themselves into their characters with such craft it's impossible to recognize them. Pitt is very convincing as the relentless Tyler; Norton finds a way to exude his wrath and confusion although his character is very cold.<br /><br />While Norton and Pitt try to see who will first break each other's nose, Fight Club lets out to the surface a splendid critic about greed, the waste of our consumit society, our egotistic aptitudes and the violent nature of men whose only contact comes when they are beating each other.<br /><br />No, Fight Club is not another movie of men throwing punches without reason, consumed by violence and self-pity.<br /><br />Good for that!
B00000G3PA|2.0|Just what where they trying to do here? Is it a science fiction movie or an MTV music video? I haven't seen so much Hollywood claptrap put together in a single movie since... well I have to admit. Hollywood does put a lot of claptrap on a fair amount of movies each year. Either way Armageddon is one of those movies that tries way too hard to be cool, stylish and sexy all the while alienating any decent storytelling in the process.  <br /> <br />Everything starts off well enough with the government going over the situation and some interesting side story at Stamper's oilrig. Even during the training scenes everything seems entertaining and even fun at times. The second the space shuttles launch you get an entirely different movie. It's an attention deficit disorderly's dream. You can pretty much time every single camera shot at about three seconds or less. Shots going back and forth between the spaceriggers and mission control and Liv looking soulfully into space and back again are dizzying and mind-boggling at times. It's like a music video gone mad. There is no room to just soak up the situation as director Michael Bay decides to just overwhelm you with bits and pieces instead.  <br /> <br />I will admit the movie does look nice. Liv Tyler is cute and the lights and cameras are in all of the right place for some perfect poses. The problem is most of the movie seems to be about nothing more than all the lights and cameras being in all the right places for those perfect poses. The script slips up big time in a few places like where Rockhound decides to go crazy for no reason and when the government went to go gather Stamper's men. I mean do these guys leave the oilrig that quickly and get their lives going all over the nation in just a couple of days? Not to mention one of them starting his own business. Can you say plot hole? Then there is the unbelievably stupid tragic ending, which I still cannot for the life of me figure out why they did it that way. It just didn't make sense for a family man to make the ultimate sacrifice (hope that didn't spoil too much... aw who cares...).  <br /> <br />Still the acting is very good when you actually get a chance to see it (like before the shuttle launch/MTV music video movie starts). Billy Bob Thornton probably gets the biggest kudos for being the ultimate professional military man with a brain and a way of people to match. Michael Clarke Duncan probably stands out more for me as well because of a particularly entertaining scene regarding a psych evaluation.  <br /> <br />I know Armageddon was a blockbuster and that people all over the world sings its praise. Well I don't! In my opinion this movie is nothing more than a cliché-ridden fluff that is to science fiction what pre-fab boy bands scantily clad teen divas are to the legitimate music world. Crrrrrap! I can't recommend this to any serious sci-fi fan and still be able to sleep at night.  <br />
B0002LI58Q|4.0|Well, it's about time Manchester got a revival -- it's been around fifteen years since bands like the Happy Mondays and Stone Roses erupted onto the music scene. Now with late-70s and mid-80s music being revived in newer, trendier bands, it's about time we got to England in the late-80s and mid-90s.<br /><br />Enter Kasabian, a Leicester band who put out catchy, synthy, and extremely entertaining rock'n'roll. What does their self-titled album sound like? Well, it has some echoes of those Manchester greats, except that it has a synth edge over those heavy riffs. Add in some very radio-friendly melodies, which are almost guaranteed to get these guys noticed by the media.<br /><br />Not that that's a bad thing -- they resemble fellow electro-Manchester band South, which happens to be among my favorite Britpop bands. Kasabian is just lighter. They kick things off on a strong note with the expansive \\"Clubb Foot,\\" which pairs gritty rock with sweeping synth, over Tom Meighan's languid vocals.<br /><br />Fortunately this is not one of those albums that has one good single, and then gets lazy. Things stay catchy and gritty, all throughout the album, with heavy riffs and steady rhythms, and Kasabian keep their style varied enough that listeners won't be left thinking, \\"Oh man, are they playing that riff AGAIN?\\"<br /><br />Not to mention the singing: Meighan has a very strong, melodious voice. In almost every song, he sings slow and lazily. He sounds either stoned or inattentive, except for a few wonderful songs where he sounds completely into what he sings. \\"John was a scientist, he was hooked on LSD/Interested in mind control and how the monkey held the key/Said that all life is experiments somebody's planning for the heir/It's for the unexpected citizens who hallucinate in fear,\\" he purrs happily.<br /><br />Yeah, it can get pretty heavy. but the music is also tempered with an ethereal edge -- there's a brief interlude which is all muffled riffs, deep synth and angelic vocals. At the very least, all that synth serves to lighten up what could have been a dark album, and adds an epic edge to what could have been terribly ordinary music.<br /><br />The flaw? It gets a bit fragmented, with two peppy electronic \\"interludes\\" sitting between harder rock'n'roll. They're pretty, but they feel out of place.<br /><br />Things climax with hints of another possible direction for them to go in: \\"U Boat,\\" a rich soundscape that fades away into silence... before fading back into a different mix of \\"Reason is Treason.\\" It's all hard angles and explosions, and if anything, this mix is even better than the radio-friendly original. (Talk about having your cake and eating it too)<br /><br />One of the few albums that is catchy and musically rich, Kasabian's debut is one of the best releases this year. It's reminiscent of Britpop greats, but somehow that doesn't matter -- they're original enough to have their own fun sound.ynth and angelic vocals.

B00008LDPU|4.0|There is some truly great traditional/computer animation hybrid filmmaking being done here. Not only graphically beautiful but with some intense and well executed stories. Be forewarned. Over half of these shorts will make very little sense if you haven't seen The Matrix. Technically you're supposed to see Animatrix between Matrix and Matrix Reloaded, but that really doesn't matter much aside from a couple of the animated shorts. Here they are in the order they come in:    Final Flight of the Osiris: This is the one that was shown in theaters before a movie. Created by the same team that did  the Final Fantasy movie, this story is about the crew of the Osiris (ship like Morpheus' Nebuchadnezzar) and the predicament they get in  (that sequeways into Matrix: Revolutions). This short makes me wonder why Square isn't handling some of the CG animation for the movie. It looks incredible. It's not quite as realistic as Final Fantasy, but it sure is close. The only bad thing about this short is it's... short. Too short. I wish they could have had the time to make this a half hour story. As it is it really lacks development.     The Second Renaissance: This is done in two parts and is the sole reason for any true Matrix fan to get this. These stories retell the rise of mankind, the fall of the machine, then eventual rise of the machine, and the fall of mankind. This is a very graphic and intense pair of stories with lots of parallels taken from actual human atrocities committed through history. It is a fascinating look into the genesis of the machines that created the Matrix. However I with they would have pushed a little further with the history lessen and get to the point where the current Matrix was created as well as how Zion was created.     Kid's Story: Another story that ties into Matrix: Reloaded. Very cool execution on this one. All of the action is rotoscoped from live action sequences to you get a realistic fluidity to everything. Animation is done sketch styled,which ads some nice artistry. When the action starts to fly the animation style gets a bit fuzzy as shapes are distorted a bit. It lends itself artistically although I am somewhat distracted by it as well.    Program: This is probably the most complete and fully developed story in the group. It's also the most \\"anime\\" one in the group with high-flying action, impressive battles and of course the animation style. It's a very nice story of internal conflicts that abound with these freedom fighters that are trying to succeed over impossible odds.     World Record: This short has some highly stylized animation to it reminiscent of Aon Flux, though meatier. Lots of deep and sharp angles as well as physical body contrasts make an otherwise simple story really stand out. And that's what makes this one good. It's not the story that makes it great. It's the way it's executed.      Beyond: This story is more whimsical compared to the others and shares a bit of wonder instead of dread. The use of CG along with various camera pans and angles really stand out nicely too. This, like world record, is a simple story with no real meaning to it aside from enjoying a moment where anything seems possible.     A Detective Story: This noir-heavy short is mostly in black and white with a grainy look through most of the scenes. I like the look, even if the story is ultimately vague in what it's trying to pull off. This is one of those short films where you can't really look too deep in it, because if you did it would spoil the good parts.     Matriculated: This story stands out on its own to a point where you don't really need to see The Matrix to have to understand what is happening. Obviously the work of Peter Chung (Aon Flux) can be seen all over this one, but don't expect Aon styled action as this story takes a different and more plot driven route. Like other pieces of Chung's work there is irony and tragedy in this short. It's good storytelling, although a little confusing regarding the \\"turning\\" methods they use.     As varied and dynamic these short films are I will have to assume not every Matrix fan will be able to get into them. These are anime films, but I'm not sure every anime fan would get into it either. Another thing to keep in mind is even though most of these shorts aren't rated assume them all to be PG-13. These aren't for children. That's for sure.     The featurette on anime is interesting and gives a look on how much it influences the W brothers. The little featurettes on each short are a mixed bag, with some being very informative and some little more than production notes. I didn't hear the audio commentaries so I couldn't tell you how those are.     If you want to see some interesting and artistic interpretations of the Matrix mythology then Animatrix is right up your alley. If you want to know some details not shown in the movies then a good half of this collection will fit that desire as well.

B0000029GA|5.0|There's absolutly no questions about it, any album better than Nas' \\"Illmatic\\". This album is an example of what real Hip Hop should sound like, or music in general for that matter. There will never be another album like \\"Illmatic\\", even if we were all to live forever. This album is a classic for sooooo many reasons. For one, the album cover is one of the most creative and essence caturing covers I've ever seen. I just love the blend of his baby picture with \\"Queens Bridge\\" projects in the background. That's the dopest idea I've seen for an album cover. Secondly, Nas' lyrical delivery sounds of a new and improved version of all the greats of the mid and late 80's, like the like's of Rakim, KRS-ONE, Big Daddy Kane, Kool-G-Rap, etc... Nas' lyrical flow is just plane ol' genius. Nas' flow on every song is unmatchable. It's hard to really have a favorite song on the album because the album is so well put together. But, if I were to pic a few I would say \\"Halftime\\", \\"The World Is Yours\\", \\"Memory Lane\\",... ah hell the whole things dope.Thirdly, the prodution on the album is the illest. The pics for the albums' prodution just feels ment to be. I can't believe the likes of Dj Premier, Pete Rock, Large Pro.,Q-Tip... Just ridiculious. I think the album should be placed in a famous museum on display amongst the greats. Nas is lucky to have such an album under his belt. I wonder if he'll come around to making another one as similar someday. You know, I've heard that for his last LP he's hookin' back up with Premier. This I gotta' see.                                       Peace.
B00004XONN|4.0|Another solid CD from Radiohead. The only problem is &quot;Idioteque&quot;. It's so good it somewhat ruins the rest of the CD. Why isn't everything this good? Worthwhile purchase. Only Kid A (the song) is somewhat substandard.
0316172324|1.0|A better (and I think, more accurate) title would be Bllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllink.<br /><br />It actually put me to sleep on several occasions, then I just gave up and quit reading it.
B000002TQV|4.0|Very good album. But as good as Ok Computer? Come on. Not a chance. Not so much an insult to this disc but a compliment to OK Computer. That is there masterpiece. But that is ok, this is still a solid disc. Black Star and Sulk are best among a lot of highlights.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This album is everything dream theater is on a much heavier plane.  I personally like the heavier overtone to this album, and it reminds me of Metallica's progressive years before Cliff died, and they sold out to the masses.  In fact this album is close to a Megadeth (Marty Freedman years) album when Mustaine was writing great pieces like Holy Wars, and Hanger 18 (without Mustaine's awful vocals).   <br /> <br />Still progressive, and writing in what I like to call a linear mode (playing longer scale like patterns).  Dream Theater is what I always hoped Rush would have become (not that Rush hasn't done great things since they were heavy).  Rush kind of abandoned their heavy tones in the 80's, and 90's, and Dream Theater basically picked up where they left off.   <br /> <br />If you are a dream theater fan then I highly doubt you will dislike this album.   <br /> <br />
B0009HLDFU|5.0|If I had to rate these cds individualally I would give the Acoustic cd 5 stars and the Rock Cd 2 stars. The acoustic cd is evidence that Grohl is becoming one of the best song writer/producer of recent memory and also shows his maturity as a musician. THE FOO FIGHTERS HAVE FOUND THERE SOUND cause this cd would be great electric also. The first cd is basically your mainstream Foo Fighters that we all have become to know and love. It doesn't have to many standout songs that I noticed, theres a couple on there like Best of You and DOA. But it got a little to mainstream for me. But I really haven't listen to it to much because I like the acoustic cd so much.
B0006IIKS0|1.0|Wow, I always knew Lars Ulrich was a whiny little wuss, but after this film I have less respect for him that I do for Britney Spears, Usher, Justin Timberlake, X-tina Aguilera, and Mariah Carey. <br /> <br />I was never a Metallica fan, but I really do enjoy watching music documentaries, and I usually find them really interesting. I could sit through episodes of VH1's Behind The Music for groups like Styx and Journey and be fascinated, even though I don't care for their music. So I figured that the guys in Metallica had to be pretty interesting, regardless of what one thinks of their music. <br /> <br />WRONG!!!! If you like watching grown men behaving like whiny little school girls, then you may enjoy this. If you are able to keep a straight face when James Hetfield has to leave band meetings and practices at a specific time every day because his therapist doesn't want him to get overly stressed, then you may enjoy this.  <br /> <br />And the best part is watching them write their lyrics. I have always been amazed by their lyrics and how they usually make absolutely no sense. Now I know why--they sit around in a room and each person just writes a bunch of sentences, and they take any that rhyme and throw them together. LAME!!!! In these guys' defense, they are talented musicians, so it's okay to be bad at writing lyrics. But maybe they should have hired somebody to write good lyrics for them. Instead, they are basically saying \\"It doesn't matter--our fans aren't intelligent enough to care about good lyrics as long as they can bang their heads and make horn signs with their hands.\\" <br /> <br />Skip this one if you are not a hardcore Metallica fan. It will make you think much less of them, I guarantee it. <br /> <br />Oh, and by the way Lars, my girlfriend bought a copy of Master Of Puppets (your only good album ever), and I sometimes listen to it. Is that okay, or am I \\"stealing\\" the music when I hear it since I didn't pay for it? Just wondering.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|The album is fricking great. <br />I own the Chariot stripped album beacuse it made no sense to buy just Chariot, when Chariot stripped wasn relatively the same price. I bought this cd from th strenth of \\"IDon't want to be\\" Only. Frankly Chariot sucks it sounds as if gavin is fighting the urge to show his true self and is scolded by record executives if he shows a pieve of emotion. Here come Chariot Stripped like a ray of sunshine and it sonds so beautifuly real. you hear all the little imperfections in his voice , that frankly make him sound better. The gritty sound of his scratched vocals makes you wish you could sing like him. The opening track of follow through on ... Stripped is great it has a midtempo beat with such beautiful lyrics and Chariot the title track of the cd sounds great. he falls off once or twice with chemical party which is not horrible but not my favorite song. Chariot is not horrible but chriot stripped is just so much better than Chariot this is a great investment cause you get to hear both tracks that way if you like the studio version of belif better than the stripped version you can listen to that one and visa versa. What a great investment!!!
B000002BFL|4.0|I am surprised by the negative reviews here. Maybe to those who only appreciate The Boss for his Born In The USA and the catchy, radio-friendliness of those songs, this album could seem a little too mellow. But for everybody that appreciates Bruce's lyrical prowess and the ability to tell an amazing, heartfelt story, this one does not disappoint. If this CD is put on as background noise while you are doing something else, then granted there is nothing that will stand out, as the songs are pretty quiet and solemn, with just Bruce's voice, guitar, and some light keyboards (mostly used for atmospheric effect). Songs such as Youngstown and Sinaloa Cowboys are so beautiful and lyrically amazing. I think everybody that owns this CD owes it to themselves to just find some time to sit down and really listen to this CD, and appreciate everything it has to offer. Heck, give up an hour of mindless TV and do your brain a favor.
B00097A5HW|4.0|After Listening several Times the songs I liked, because the truth the first time that  listens to it I don't like I for anything, the artistic evolution is Noticed that  has had, although Definitively it is not the best work discografico in her, the song that I like but after La Tortura it isLa Pared its rhythm and letter is they are pleasant, one of the best is NOT, it is necessary to emphasize that it is the first time that shakira interprets a song that is not of its responsibility, Las De La Intuicion  has a good rhythm and it is amusing, the rhythm Bossa Nova of Obtener Un Si it is very calm and  rises until the sky it relaxes you until the maximum thing, the worst song in the Album is En Tus Pupilas it is too boring it provokes me I vomit, but the rest of the disk is acceptable.
B000002LCI|5.0|M.F.T.M. is not only one of the three best DM album (the others two: Violator and Song Of Faith And Devotion), but it's one of the best piece of music of the 80's. More than that - it's one of the best piece of music of the very last 30 years. It looks like all the previous DM records reach the final goal with the songs of MFTM, and it contains already the seeds of what DM sound would grow in the next ten years. <br /> <br />Wonderful.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This is one of the best albums of 2005, a true gem. Coldplay deserves all the praise because they delivered a superior record. Good music is hard to find these days. Finally, someone steps forward and makes something worthwhile. \\"X&Y\\" will be remembered for a long time. I will spend many good days listening to this album.
B0006L16N8|1.0|I couldn't help thinking how much Coldplay reminds me of Salieri who tried so hard to be better than Mozart.  The problem with Coldplay is that they try just too darn hard... real talent is more effortless and natural.  The best bands focus on their art and content; they don't sit around and deliberate which marketing strategy they should take in order to please their listeners.  They have their own sounds and styles that will withstand the time.  Coldplay writes pleasant music, but it's the type of sound that's liked at the moment but will soon be forgotten, like The Monkeys, like Salieri.  In a nutshell, it's just not nice to ripe Radiohead or U2 music and have the guts then to proclaim you're one of the best bands in the world. In this world of mass marketing, maybe you will be \\"successful\\", but you'll never earn the musical respect bestowed on the truly talented. Sorry, but the Radiohead complex is still obviously there.
B00005JNJT|2.0|Don't think.  If you do you won't enjoy Batman Begins.  If you don't think about what is going on in the movie and just watch, you just might enjoy it.  <br /> <br />I'll go into three major things that upset me about this movie:  <br /> <br />One, all of the dialogue was so bad in this movie.  It rivaled the dialogue in the Star wars movies.  That's why I opened this review up by telling you not to think in the movie.  The dialogue didn't live up to other superhero movies recently like Spiderman. <br /> <br />Two.  Where were the villans?  Batman is supposed to have villans.  All batman fought were a docter wearing a canvas mask, some mob guys, and his ninja teacher.  None of them really seemed like villans to me.  They seemed more like normal angry people with some problems that they needed to work out.  In the past, Batman has had Joker to deal with.  He seems more villan like to me. <br /> <br />Three.  How many times are we going to see a fight on a moving train in superhero movies.  It seems like it's really getting old.  It started with Spiderman 2 on a raised subway car.  Now in batman we get to see basically the same scene only on a monorail train instead.  Both were running to the end of the track, and the hero needs to defeat the bad guy and get out of the train before it crashes.  It was almost the same scene.  I hope fantastic 4 doesn't include this superhero scene as well. <br /> <br />Batman Begins was better than DareDevil and the Hulk, but it still kind of a disappointment for a superhero movie.  Like I said, don't think to much, and you might enjoy the movie.
B000000993|5.0|This CD is great only being topped by Aenima. Prison sex is just a great song. Sober is one of the most powerful and deepest songs I have ever heard. My personal favorite is Swamp Song, this is one of the angriest songs ever and it is so hard. I spit on any1 who gives this lower than 5 stars.
B000022TSH|5.0|Chinatown the best of the nuevo film noir films of the 70's.  Roman Polanski crafted a great detective story veiled in the classic shades of grey from the original screenplay by Robert Towne. <br /> <br />The greatest mysteries are based on fact but covered in fiction.  This is based on the a water scandal in Los Angeles back in the thirties.  Twist this around a murder, family secrets and politics.  This has everything.  It was easily the best picture of 1974. <br /> <br />Jack Nicholson gives his best performance as the detective who is anything but a hero.  Faye Dunaway is perfect as the not so clean damsel in distress.  But John Huston, in one of his rare acting role, steals the show as the amoral industrialist. <br /> <br />In the end you don't really care who did it.  You just enjoy each layer being removed and the next secret being revealed.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|The Foo Fighters keep finding a way to produce great music, and here is another worthy effort.  <br /> <br /> I remember seeing the Foo Fighters live a few years ago when they were kicking off their \\"One by One\\" tour and they were definitely one of the best live bands I have seen. They seem to bring energy into their music, live or recorded, that is missing from many of the rock bands of today.  <br /> <br />As far as the CD is concerned, I really think that this is a better effort than One by One, which in its own right is a solid work. The Foo Fighters have been very consistent over the past decade, and \\"In Your Honor\\" is no exception. Sure people may complain that certain songs on the CD are formulaic, but I've always thought this argument doesn't work well with music. If something sounds good, then you should keep producing it. Of all the songs on the first CD, \\"Best of You\\" seems to stand out. It is not only well-written, but it seems to have a perfect combination of both hard and soft edges that makes it a balanced song that you can really rock out to. The first song on the CD, \\"In Your Honor\\", is a song used to be an intro into the CD, and it works well as this, as it starts off soft and progresses to a harsher sound. Overall, there is a definite progression in the band from their first self titled CD approximately 9 years ago to this one. Dave Grohl's capability as a song writer and musician has progressed, and this album reflects this. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of the Foo Fighters, then this one is definitely worth the money.  <br />
B0009IW88A|5.0|The soundtrack is powerful... I've seen it in a IMAX Theater and the trumpets surround me when they appear. Definitivily I wanna buy this soundtrack, forgot the last 4 movies, this is a \\"Borron y cuenta nueva\\", welcome Batman.... I hope that this cd, be part of a trilogy of powerfoul soundtracks.

1400032717|5.0|The only way I can figure to describe this book is different.  I haven't ever read anything like this before, but I really enjoyed it.  Basically, the book is told through the first person perspective of an autistic 15 year old boy who is trying to find out who killed his neighbor's poodle Wellington.  Along the way, neighborhood secrets are uncovered. <br /> <br />The main character Christopher is truly unique.  Having no personal experience with autism, I wasn't entirely sure what to expect from the book.  What I got was a wonderfully drawn character with a very different perspective than mine.  Christopher loves math and science, and as such, the book is populated by little factoids, which, being a math geek myself, I found interesting.  However, the book also has many strong messages.  Despite his autism, Christopher is really observant about human nature and he often describes his observations in terms of math and science concepts. <br /> <br />I think the best part of the book is its realism.  The main character can be frustrating at times, so you can really sympathize with his parents, but at the same time, you can be somewhat frustrated with the parents.  I think it really shows the complex nature of living with someone with a disability and being a person with a disability, in this case autism.   <br /> <br />The writing is really excellent.  It's simplistic by nature, but it's captivating.  The story and particularly the perspective of the story are interesting.  Most of it centers around Christopher's adventures into the mundane world we take for granted, like riding on the subway.  It's truly an excellent read, and I highly recommend it.  5 stars! <br />
B0000DD7LC|5.0|This second cd from Alicia Keys showcases her incredible musical talent perfectly.  Although the image of Alicia as a pianist is overated at times her voice and song writing skills are her real hidden treasures.  Any fan of R&B should love this album.  Good work Alicia....Let's keep it going...
B00062RCBW|5.0|AS I HAVE REVIEWED IN THE STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE 9 SERIES, THE BIG <br />BUT IS THE OUTRAGIOUS COST OF THIS COLLECTION.  NOT MANY EVERY DAY FANS CAN AFFORD THE SERIES. IS THIS MARKETED JUST TO THE UPPER MIDDLE CLASS OR WHAT.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|Just like many people on here who have given reviews, I'm an old avenged sevenfold fan.  When I first heard that Shadows was going to sing the entire album, I was still pretty excited about what it was going to sound like.  Hearing the album, I was pretty shocked at what they sounding like.  It reminded me of a old Iron Maiden/Judas Priest album.  I can see why many people are pissed off because they are no longer metalcore, but I still find the music pretty amazing.  The dualing solos were awesome.  The only thing I thought that was very disappointing was Shadows voice.  I'm not disappointed by the fact that there is no screaming, but by the fact the vocals were not that great.  The singing in the earlier album was much better, but now Shadows sounds really bad and corny.  Despite the vocals, I still give it a 4 for the instrumental work.  You do have to listen to this with a open mind.
B0002JJBZY|4.0|DON'T GET ME WRONG, I LOVE THIS SERIES, BUT YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THE LINES WERE A LITTLE CORNY AND SHATNER DID PLAY KIRK IN AN OVERBLOWN WAY. NOW, TO THE REAL REASON I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW.  AS I ALSO REVIEWED IN THE \\"NEXT GENERATION\\", \\"DEEP SPACE 9\\" AND \\"VOYAGER\\" SERIES, I THING THE PRICING ON ALL THESE SERIES IS OUTRAGIOUS.  IF YOU ARE A REAL FAN, YOU WILL WANT ALL THESE SERIES, BUT WHO CAN AFFORD EVEN ONE OF THE COMPLETE SERIES.  PRICE THESE SERIES REASONABLY AND I'LL THINK ABOUT BUYING THEM.
B000268QB2|5.0|I was first introduced to Keane back in  October 2003 when they opened up for Travis in Toronto.  I was instantly drawn into their music and was amazed by how full they sounded live with only a piano, drums and vocals.  After that show I wanted to find out everything I could about Keane, but unfortunately they didn't have any albums out yet. As soon as the album came out in May 2004, I bought it and even caught them live again at a small club gig in June.  Over a year later and I still haven't stopped listening to the album.  Every song on the album is beautiful and magical.  My favourites are &quot;Somewhere Only We Know&quot;, &quot;Everybody's Changing&quot;, &quot;We Might As Well Be Strangers&quot;, &quot;Can't Stop Now&quot; and &quot;Bedshaped&quot;.  There's something about Tom Chaplin's voice that's very uplifting and gives me chills every time I hear it.  And if you think the album is good, I highly recommend you check out a Keane gig...now that's perfection!  I'm looking forward to hearing what they come up with on their next album.  But in the meantime, everybody go get &quot;Hopes and Fears&quot; now!
B0006L16N8|5.0|I'm so tired of the AROBTTH and X&Y comparisons because it's such a waste of time and energy. X&Y is better and I can say that without even having to think twice about it. I won't waste memory comparing SQUARE ONE to POLITIK because SQUARE ONE puts its predecessor to shame. Coldplay gets everything right the third time. All the Coldplay purists come on here to crap on X&Y because they think they've got it right. But they're wrong in so many different ways I can't name them all. Who wants to waste their time rehashing every inch of an album recorded 3 years ago? Like it and take a step forward. People should learn how to move on and judge the new material for what it is. We should be celebrating Coldplay's improvement not comparing each line of AROBTTH to that of X&Y. That's so incredibly tedious. Just enjoy the music for a change. Sit back and experience what Coldplay truly has to offer. You might learn a thing or two. X&Y is a musical journey. The more often you take it, the better it will get.
B00005JNQQ|5.0|I would not say this was the best animated film I've seen, but I gave it 5 stars because it was just FUN.  My daughters, 8 & 5, laughed the whole time and were so caught up that they cheered at the end.
B000001Y42|3.0|Flash back to 1997. Nu-metal has been alive for about five years. Soft verses and hard choruses are still new and nu-metal is very popular, yet it is also in its infant stages. Bands like Korn, P.O.D., Snot, Deftones, and Coal Chamber exist and are in their prime. These bands have helped usher in nu-metal and give birth to dozens of future bands.<br /><br />Which brings us to Limp Bizkit. Limp is a band who is as responsible as any other band for creating the genre and popularizing rap-rock. They definitely brought it to the mainstream (since this C.D. came before Korn's \\"Follow the Leader\\"), and, even though Rage Against the Machine debuted in 1992, Fred Durst and Company have a certain insecure, immature, self-hating, middle finger to the world attitude that nobody else has matched. That attitude is actually part of this group's charm; it is their marketing gimmick.<br /><br />DJ Lethal (formally of House of Pain) is one of the more talented DJ's at scratching (he shines brightest on the song \\"Clunk,\\") but Limp Bizkit's greatest quality might be its three relatively unknown musicians: guitarist Wes Borland, drummer John Otto, and his cousin, bassist Sam Rivers. Wes has gotten the credit he deserves: one of nu-metal's better guitarists, but John and Sam are still quite underrated. And, love him or hate him, I believe Limp Bizkit wouldn't be Limp Bizkit without Fred Durst. If you listen closely, you'll hear the band's influences range from rap and rap-rock (Fred has cited RATM as an influence) to jazz (John Otto learned jazz-style drumming).<br /><br />A young Limp Bizkit (who have not yet sold out) release \\"Three Dollar Bill, Ya'll\\" onto an unsuspecting world. It is a very angry, emotional, and energetic album with raw production that appeals to teenagers all throughout the world.<br /><br />\\"Three Dollar Bill, Ya'll\\" is, to me, the definition of a three star album. It has its pluses and about as many minuses. It's often the case that the same song has some good aspects, but also some bad.<br /><br />Tracks two and three, \\"Pollution\\" and \\"Counterfeit,\\" are similar to each other because they are both funky, noisy rockers with ham fisted rapping and throat-straining yelling. Plus, both of these songs have talented, exploding guitar work. Both of these songs have mosh-worthy moments, and \\"Pollution\\" sounds almost thunderous at times, but \\"Counterfeit\\" goes on for too long and ends with Fred making dumb mouth noises. Tracks four and five, \\"Stuck\\" and \\"Nobody Loves Me,\\" are similar in that regard. \\"Stuck\\" has catchy drumming and uses the soft-hard dynamic well, and \\"Nobody Loves Me\\" builds well, and has a guitar which makes hip-hop sound effects. Unfortunately, both of these songs are dragged down by some mediocre lyrics. \\"Stuck\\" features the refrain: \\"You make a dash for my cash/it's that a- - that I'm blasting,\\" and \\"Nobody Loves Me\\" has the out of place-and quite odd sounding-line: \\"Maybe I'll go eat worms.\\"\\"Sour\\" has distant, dwindling guitar chords and jazzy drumming, but it also goes on for too long with a pointless outro. \\"Stalemate\\" opens slowly and melodically, with whispering and what sounds like panting at times. After the beginning's over, the listener expects an onslaught. This song gradually grows louder, and has some twangy guitar work, but the onslaught never happens. \\"Faith\\" is probably the most well known and recognizable song on here. It helped rocket Limp Bizkit into fame. The beginning of this song, which sounds almost poppy, isn't very far removed from the original. (This is a cover song, the original was performed by George Michael.) I enjoy how this song builds, gets heavier, and Fred Durst yells and gets so worked up that he his gasping for air by the end of the second chorus. But, the first half of this song is better than the second half, as the second half suffers from out of place rapping. Finally, \\"Indigo Flow\\" has some OK music, but it ultimately comes across as incomplete and filler (it is just a thank you note from Fred to some other bands, like Deftones and Korn.)<br /><br />One other major flaw is that Fred's voice sounds distorted most of the time. When he yells, it can be a bit grating. It may be because Fred was a bit young when they made this C.D., or maybe he made his voice this way as a contribution to the raw sound. It may be because this album sounds so raw, but there are even some Limp Bizkit haters who love this album! So, there you have it; this C.D. has its ups and downs, but it averages out to be a decent album. And even if you hate it, you've got to admit it's essential nu-metal. Personally, I don't love or hate Limp Bizkit, but I think this is a fun C.D. to pop in from time to time. The bottom line is \\"Three Dollar Bill, Ya'll\\" has its flaws, but it is, overall, Limp Bizkit in their purest form.(it is just a thank you note from Fred to some other bands, like Deftones and Korn.) <br /> <br />One other major flaw is that Fred's voice sounds distorted most of the time.

B0009QBLA8|5.0|A very unique and strange.  This movie was made ahead of its time.  Definitely a movie you shouldn't see sober and with a closed mind.  A MUST SEE, cult classic.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Incoherent thriller that has Keanu Reeves in full matrix mold and making a complete fool out of himself with a pretty bad script. His performance is not very good and he's miscast for the role he is in. The other actors in the film, most noticeable Rachel Weisz ( She does give the best performance in this movie, she is that good), Djimon Hounsou and Tilda Swinton all do better than poor Keanu in there roles and manages to rise above some of the cliches and the flimsy plot to give solid performances but not even they can get pass the fact of how badly this film was made and how incoherent it really is.  For their performance alone, the movie gets a star from me but don't expect much from the movie itself.
B000056NX5|3.0|Some caveats; okay, I must admit, I am NOT a huge fan of the play. As a Christian believer, I find it very difficult to appreciate ALW's treatment of a character who is for many a religious icon, and for a few of us, something far more. (--Jesus as a deluded, ego-driven, attention seeking diva??) Nor does it help that I personally do not enjoy rock music. I should also say that as to different versions or productions of this play, I have very little to compare it to, other than the original CD and bits and pieces of the older film.     *HOWEVER*, all that said- I will say that this DVD's performance has helped me to understand much better what so many fans love about this play. This is good theater, if bad theology. Superstar does an excellent job at conveying the sense of menace, the emotional highs and lows of the events it depicts, and of exploring the political- and psychological- mechinations which brought them about. There are some powerful and dramatic scenes (Trial Before Pilate and the 39 Lashes), and rare moments when Lloyd Webber actually gets it very nearly right (Could We Start Again Please?). I also appreciate that, at the VERY least, Judas in the play's title song, is finally asking the right questions.     Yet, after nearly 2 hours of hearing character after character, from Judas to Pilate to Herod to even Mary Magdalene, almost subliminally write Jesus off as ONLY human, \\"JUST a man\\", I wonder how seriously most people in the audience would consider revising that conclusion.
0553565915|4.0|This book is commonly regarded as a powerful, but flawed, look at what happens to us after we die.  This book has special meaning for me because it's the first book on near death experiences that I ever read, and it's message and story is still powerful to me today, four years after first reading it.<br /><br />The book concerns the near death experience of Mrs. Eadie, who died and payed a visit to the spiritual world beyond death.  Mrs. Eadie's writting style is simple and gets the point across withought fluffing it up with fancy words.<br /><br />There are many beautiful passages in this book.  My personal favorite is when Mrs. Eadie meets Jesus after she dies, and gets a big hug from him while feeling totally loved.  This passage is beautifully written, and it was extremly easy for me to get an idea of how powerful the experience must have been.<br /><br />While visiting the spiritual world, Mrs. Eadie describes libraries where one can lean anything they wish, gets a life review, and learns (then forgets) her mission on earth.<br /><br />Overall, Mrs. Eadie does an excellent job of describing the spiritual world, and how loving and accepting it is.  She does this so well in fact, that after reading the book for the first time, I had absaloutly no fear of death anymore (which is still true today).<br /><br />As people have noted, this book is written from the view of a catholic, meaning that a lot of the material is written reflecting Mrs. Eadie's faith.  But she does say in the book that religions fit the needs of people who need them, and that religion is not important in the spiritual world.<br /><br />What confuses me though (and drops the rating down a star) is the description of the Devil and demons.  Some other reviewers have pointed out that some of Mrs. Eadie's passages contradict each other, such as the garden of Eden bits.  And if one researches near death experiences extensivly, then it becomes clear that the devil does not exist, yet he is talked about here, and some of his demons show up.  This is most likely a result of Mrs. Eadie's personal faith, but it is a little disturbing.<br /><br />Overall though, this book is a classic that should be read by those who wish to learn more about the spiritual world.  The passage alone of Mrs. Eadie recieving Jesus's love is worth the price of the book alone (and her descriptions of Gods love are quite nice as well!).  The message it carries (that love is everything, and that if we all love another, then we can create Heaven on earth) is one that brings forth hope and joy for the future.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.is most likely a result of Mrs. Eadie's personal faith, but it is a little disturbing.

1594200106|5.0|I loved this book!  There is humor, sorrow, love, suspense, friendship, tragedy, brutality, revenge, fabulous sense of time and place and a fountain pen that connects the story together through time.  The language is flowery, and the pace sometimes slow but I never wanted to put it down.  There was a twist I didn't expect yet all the ends are neatly tied into a perfect circle at the end.  It's not a traditional mystery, but it is a wonderful book.
0920668372|5.0|When I was younger I remember sitting in my daddy's lap while he read this book to me. Now at the age of 19 I still love this book. In fact I still own the same copy he read to me. I read a lot of these reviews and was completely shocked by how some of you found this book \\"creepy\\" and \\"disturbing.\\" When my dad read me this book I never thought it was weird that the mother drove across town to sing this song to her grown son. I thought it was cute and sweet. The thought of death never occured to me at all while reading this book. Even when I read the book today it doesn't. The book to me was just showed the deep love between a parent and a child. Everytime I read the book the only thing I think about is the great memories I have with my dad. I highly recommend this book for both the young and old. Anybody who analyzes a \\"childrens\\" book and finds something wrong with it obviously has nothing better to do.
0316096199|5.0|Lucky is a nonfiction book detailing the author's account of being sexually assaulted while a college student. She opens with the horrible rape scene and follows with the  difficulty of falling back into step with life again in its aftermath.  Battered by flashbacks and lacking real support from her odd family, the author shares with her reading public the difficulty of returning to the semblance of a \\"normal\\" life when others knew more than they needed to know about her unfortunate situation.  <br /> <br />I'm very glad I gave this author a second chance.  I hated and could not finish her non-fiction book, The Lovely Bones, but I am mesmerized by Lucky.  The book is amazingly good. Some of the writing is so beautiful.  All of it is deeply felt and expressive of the author's deepest thoughts.  It must be very hard to bring these thoughts into words in a way in which the reader can feel what the author does.  In it, she really bares her soul. The message is so important  that I both started a bookray (book sharing opportunity) with it and gave it to my daughter (also a college student) to read.
B00005JNJT|5.0|I have been a fan of Batman for as long as I can remember and ever since the comic book movie renisannce began I was hoping that Warner Brothers would take another shot at a Batman movie. This movie outside of the original Batman is probably the best Batman flick ever. I have to qualify this performance as 2nd to the original Tim Burton film for 2 reasons. The first being that this movie, like it or not, borrows heavily from the style of the first film (fans had never seen Batman's signature Grapple Gun or black Batsuit until Burton's film realized them, for example) and second because without the first film this film may never have been created. HOWEVER, this is the first live-action Batman film to actually focus on....Batman. While the other films recognized the importance of developing the villian, Batman Begins realizes the importance of developing the hero.

B0007Y4TVU|3.0|I'd have to agree with an earlier reviewer in that I really give this record 3 1/2 stars.  Although it's obviously the first disc of two they'll release this year, this is a great record and I recommend anyone pick it up.  It's a good introduction to System Of A Down yet continues their saga in album form. <br /> <br />\\"B.Y.O.B.\\" is a good rocker with a good hooking chorus that gets you thinking about the \\"robots\\" fighting in Iraq.  The almost operatic tones of \\"Revenga\\" make it stand out as possibly the best track.  \\"This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song\\" is a great anarchaic romp reminiscent of their first record.  \\"Question\\" and \\"Sad Statue\\" continue the political thought, with \\"Old School Hollywood\\" and \\"Lost In Hollywood\\" end the album on a good but strange note.   <br /> <br />The last two tracks really don't belong with each other and the record overall doesn't have the flow of \\"Toxicity\\", their best record.  Still, S.O.A.D. is one if not the best band out there and their new offering does not disappoint, making you want the next album even more.  Even better, catch these guys live.
B000286RNY|5.0|And that's exaclty what this game of soccer is.  in any other parts of the world, you'd see people fight hard with whistles blowing if hostility is present.  But here it's agenst the rules to be a class A chump.  Well on third thought they don't care, they'll let you find out the hard way by letting the other team give you a humiliating beatdown.<br /><br />The story starts with Golden Leg(Man Tat Ng) Who was famus until he made a big mistake.  While depressed he ran into Sing(Stephen Chow) who told him how useful Shaolin is in multiple ways.  This guy loves sholin so much, he falls for a not-so attractive employee for a steam bun store(Vicki Zhao Wei, who in reality isn't ugly(dang makeup) but very very cute).  And when it is interjected that Shaolin can be used for soccer, that's when the parterner ship between Golden Leg, and Sing expandes to more friends, to go to the prestigious tournament, shoot for $1,000,000, and to revive the Golden Legs name, and get the right word of Shaolin around.  But in order to acomplish this, they must man up to hand out whoopings, or get stomped.<br /><br />This movie has very creative ways of making comedy.  Some things start a laugh by making you say what the fudge?(Like when everyone was dancing at the steam-bun stand, and when Sing was visualizing a Saving Private Ryan theeme while in the test game)  They have so much comedy in this film, from horrible Chareokee singers, to a bald girl getting called E.T.(Well what was she thinking)  The special effects are fake looking but the way it's used is just for-jorkin' hillarious.(Like when guys fly around after getting hit)<br /><br />Shaolin Soccer is an exellent film by Stephen Chow, the directer, wrtiter and the star.(Alot, but not to much for one man)  This film is well done, and thank God there was the oringinal Chinese unrated version on the DVD.  Man America cut the crap out of this movie when I saw it on starz. Anywho, this should be watched by people who enjoy soccer, comedy, or Asian cinema.  Fans of Stephen Chow, and Vicki Zhao Wei would definitly love this comedy for the family.omedy, or Asian cinema.  Fans of Stephen Chow, and Vicki Zhao Wei would definitly love this comedy for the family.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Apparently not. Matt Stone and Trey Parker have always been geniouses at making the most offensive, pushing the envelope comedies ever. My favorite genre of movie is comedy. My library may not be strong, but trust me, I have seen just about every comedy ever made. The one star reviewers say that the jokes are old and out-dated. I was wondering, did you and I see the same movie? I have never seen or heard these jokes anywhere else. if anyone can tell you that accurately, its me.  <br /> <br />This movie is hilarious. Its got great satire and bashes whatever it can. Some people say it lets conservatives off the hook and focuses mainly on bashing liberals. Well, you know what? Matt and Trey have been making fun of conservatives longer than liberals. If any of their creations prove that, it is definately the South Park movie. That was thier conservative bashing movie, now this one is the liberal bashing movie. I won't explain the story, because a lot of people have already written reviews which explained it, so go read thier's if you really want to know what its about.  <br /> <br />The movie generally pokes fun at the film actors guild, or F.A.G. It makes fun of all the actors who try and act all \\"liberal\\" and protest the war. The most noticeable among others, is Michael Moore. Well, all I can say about that is, I am glad somebody had the balls to make fun of Michael Moore, because he is really f**king annoying with his stupid pointless movies.  <br /> <br />The movie is funny, in general. And the plot isn't very bad either. I just don't like the whole romance thing thrown in here. its kind of gay. Then again, in one of the special features, Matt Stone did say, \\"I am very shocked to see that our crew is so focused on making this movie. Just a gay little script we wrote, and to my suprise, everyone is taking it so seriously.\\"  <br /> <br />Which brings me to my next point: Special Features. There are a lot of them to keep you busy, and are in fact, pretty imformative and interesting as to what it took to make this movie. <br /> <br />Nonstop explosions, hilarious satire, just get this movie. Its a keeper. Thanks for reading. If you really enjoyed the movie, I also suggest you get the soundtrack.  <br /> <br />-PEACE YO! <br />
B00000DG1R|5.0|If you are a regular follower of my reviews, you've probably gathered that I'm a huge fan of 1980s' rock. Poison, Motley Crue and the best of them all Def Leppard - I love them. However, Duran Duran was a band I never really liked. True, I pretty much based on my opinion on them on one song (the dreadful James Bond theme \\"A View To A Kill\\", which I'm sure will eventually grow on me), but just their look alone also didn't appeal to me. But then I heard \\"The Reflex\\" in \\"American Wedding\\" (during Stifler's dance bar at the gay bar), and I knew that I had to have that song. Well, I purchased their new hits cd \\"Greatest\\" for that one song, but I wound up getting much more than I wanted.<br /><br />\\"Greatest\\" offers pretty much all the Duran Duran you could possibly. In addition to \\"The Reflex\\" and \\"A View To A Kill\\", you get certified 1980s' classics like \\"Rio\\" (one of the best music videos ever!), \\"Wild Boys\\", \\"Notorious\\", \\"New Moon On Monday\\", \\"Is There Something I Should Know\\" and a host of others to satisfy your cravings for blissful nostalgia of the era of big hair and big hooks. Plus you get two songs from their 1993 comeback, \\"Ordinary World\\" and \\"Come Undone\\", as well as their awesome 1997 minor single \\"Electric Barbarella\\" (the title is fitting since the group actuallly took its name from the 1968 Jane Fonda classic \\"Barbarella\\"). To entice hardcore Duranies, album tracks such as the awesome \\"Serious\\" and the Prince-like \\"Skin Trade\\" (which actually was a single) have been added.<br /><br />The bonus dvd is brilliant, containing their videos. Oh, those classic videos. In short, this album is highly recommendable. I would suggest purchasing it as soon as possible.

B0002XH9Z4|4.0|This collection beats all the other Michael Jackson compilation out there. But there are a few flaws. For one, it needs a lot more songs in there. HIStory, In the Closet, Give Into Me, Heal the World, the original We are the World, Scream (a big flaw of letting it out of the collection), The Love You Save, Human Nature, Liberian Girl, Earth Song (well, that's not a great song, the video was great though), and more, was left out of the \\"Ulitmate\\" collection. And the other flaw was the DVD concert. The concert was okay but Michael seemed to not do his best in this concert, I mean he was barely singing on Billie Jean let alone Human Nature. I was grateful that they included a DVD in it but I wish it was another concert, like the MJ 30th Anniversary concert which I still wish they would release it on DVD. But otherwise it was I liked it. It should have been called the Great Collection rather than the Ultimate Collection.
B00097A5HW|3.0|Let me first say that I do not understand even a little bit of Spanish. None. I LOVED \\"Donde Estan Las Ladrones,\\" because it was so high energy and catchy, especially \\"Ojos Asi,\\" which is one of my Top 10 favorite songs of all time, and I can't even understand what she is saying. Well, this album is definitely not \\"Ladrones.\\" It is very boring for me to listen to other than a couple of songs. I guess the emotion gets lost on me because I don't speak Spanish, but the ballads and mid-tempo songs, which make up 5 of the 10 songs, did nothing for me. Just a couple of songs I really like. \\"La Tortura\\" is a lot of fun, and \\"Las De La Intuicion\\" could be a huge club hit if given the chance. I almost like \\"La Pared,\\" the chorus starts off really strong and powerful and then she changes chords or something halfway through the first line and it just deflates. I am still excited for \\"Oral Fixation Vol.2,\\" I just hope she puts more up-tempo songs on it. <br /> <br />Note to all musical artists: Don't start an album with the most boring song om the disc...
B00003CWN3|4.0|I saw this movie about a week after seeing \\"Million Dollar Baby.\\"  The question that immediately comes to mind is, how many contemporary actresses have the talent of Hilary Swank?  She is absolutely amazing as Brandon, the main character of the movie.  Her performance is nothing less than astounding and she deserved every bit of her academy award.  .<br /><br />The movie is about a young woman named Teena Brandon who wants to be a man and, therefore, lives her life under the alias of Brandon Teena.  She goes to live in an area of viral white trash that is unlike any region I've ever seen and undoubtedly unlike any region which actually exists.<br /><br />The rural community she moves into is Hollywood's version of the heartland and it doesn't seem to have much relation to the real thing.  It is a dark fantasy of American life wherein religion has been transfused from the local culture. The population of the countryside seems to have been replaced with the inhabitants of a large mental hospital.  Yet, anti-social personalities can be found everywhere and this area of Nebraska is no exception.  Swank's character is highly unfortunate to have befriended two of them.  John and Tom are felons with no respect for the law or any other human beings, and the heroine, through no real fault of her own, unwittingly becomes the target of their ire.<br /><br />Peter Sarsgaard plays a convincing monster who is the source of most of the film's drama while the love affair between Swank and Chloe Sevigny was quite authentic.  The tale is tragic but extremely well-done.  It would be hard not to recommend this one.
B000003TA4|1.0|It's this garbage that was passed off as music. Kurt nobrain is proof that abortions arent a bad thing. This crap also proves that payola does exist. Theres no way that this junk would get played if it wasnt for the dj's being payed off. My only regret is that I wasnt able to kill nobrain myself!! Burn in hell,LOSER!!!!!!!!
6305558167|5.0|Well, we all know the plot of this one, but Boorman's sets and creative zeal make this telling of Camelot stand the test of time.  It has to be one of the most beautiful and enchanting movies that I've ever seen.  My father took me to it when I was a boy and it was the first R rated movie I ever saw--legally that is, we used to sneak in to the Rs after we would buy tickets for the PG ones.  The characters of Merlin and Arthur could not be cast any better.  Indeed, this particular Arthur is so kind, loyal, and true that it makes the Gueneviere/ Lancelot love affair quite painful. What this Arthur lacks in appearance he makes up for in countenance.  As for Lancelot, I did not particularly like this version of him as the knights' locks painfully remind one of Tom Jones.  Another incidental, the soundtrack...even more heavenly than the sets.  A must see for a boy on the verge of manhood.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Perhaps, Coldplay is an acquired taste. But that certainly doesn't degrade the quality of their album. It's a good CD regardless of whether it would qualify as elevator music or not. Boring? Why? Because there's no sex, profanity, or vulgarity? There's just good music. Finally, musicians and artists that spend more time on the quality of their work than on their persona and reputation. At least someone is still interested in making music. Is it better than AROBTTH? I would say yes. But everyone's entitled to their opinion. Like a good book, X&Y requires a through read. I would recommend this CD to people who want to listen to Rock music that's a little more polished. They're not your typical 2005 MTV band. In the 80's and early 90's they would have been. If you're really interested in what makes a good Rock album, then I would check out Coldplay. I guess this album does require more patience, not for me. But I suppose it could be classified as a grower.

B00005JNJT|5.0|After experimenting with imagery/scripting inconsistencies that had actually made the 1960's TV series look sophisticated by comparison (Batman and Robin, Batman Forever), the Batman movie series returns to the brooding and tortured millionare which we adore.<br /><br />In this film, we see how a young Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) copes with his parents murder. Because he has the money and resources, Wayne ultimately decides to become Batman--a vigilante 'anti-hero' hero who takes the law into his own hands when the police cannot stop evil from overrunning Gotham City. Bruce ultimately wants to ensure that other people will not experience the tragedy which he has known. He subsequently walks a very fine line between administering justice and exacting revenge.<br /><br />There are some bumps along the way to Bruce's infamous 'reincarnation'. The begining of the film shows young \\"Master Wayne\\" recieving abuse in a generic prison camp for 'research' but ultimately concluding that even he cannot join in his rescuer's idea of justice, killing another person. Already traumatized as he is, Bruce is still a good guy due to his all-critical remaining shred of humanity. Yet, this scene also hints that he theoretically could have snapped under other conditions.<br /><br />Immediately following an overseas trip, Bruce finds that Gotham is now in shambles. Adding insult to this injury, he also learns that his own company is now convieniently on the verge of being taken away from him.<br /><br />Bob Kane's Dark Knight Detective was never supposed to be a camp icon(ala West and Clooney's portrayals); he was supposed to be THE thing which lurks in the shadows against injustice. Batman is a mystery precisely because he worked with the police, but was explicitly not one of them. This film also explains how Gotham PD ultimately came to trust Batman.<br /><br />We see a young Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) who is destined to become Gotham City's police commissioner in the future. The city is SO corrupt at this point that he is the only honest cop left. Gordon desperately wants help maintaining law and order so turning to an outsider who can deliver this is his logical conclusion. Their early partnership thus lays critical foundation for why Gordon and Batman work together in subsequent years; Gordon knows that Batman also wants to clean up Gotham--and can deliver on it. Gordon recognizes that the Batman is an effective if wholly unorthodox crime control resource.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman also stars as Lucius Fox, a family friend who helps Bruce create the Batman personna. He is a scientist in the then-taken over Wayne Enterprises who somehow managed to escape the scrutiny of a devilsh Rutger Hauer. Fox ultimately helps to devise all of Batman's awesome crime-fighting gadgets in the tradition of James Bond's 'Q'. I don't think there is a single film which Morgan Freeman has been involved with that I did not like. This man's name simply oozes talent.<br /><br />We also meet Jonathan 'Scarecrow' Crane (Cillian Murphy), who is a really unethical psychatrist. According to this screenplay, he is Batman's first 'big villan'. The Scarecrow wants to control the City of Gotham by drugging the water supply with psychedelic mind controls. The special effects department did a wonderful job with the character, I definently was terrified after seeing this character throughout the screen play. I also could not find anything laughable about him.<br /><br />Christian Bale is handsome as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and I feel guilty because I had never previously cared to see something which he was playing in before now. Bale brings the perfect match of sensitivity and unbalancw that is essentially needed for this part (Batman IS fundamentally a vengange gig from a disturbed milionare) and I know this film is going to be a blockbuster of the summer, if not the year.<br /><br />I have not been this enthusiastic about a Batman movie since 1992's Batman Returns (with Michael Keaton then in the lead role). I am seeing this one release several times, something which I honestly have not done with any film since I was a little girl.<br /><br />I am also willing to predict Batman Begins generates renewed interest in the Batman concept. The design people for this film have obviously taken considerable care to give depth and credibility to the 'begins' concept, the Bat signal is not as it would look in most other movies. There is a sense that Batman really is starting but is serious about wanting to do a good job of eliminating crime.<br /><br />Hopefully, the studios ultimately now understand that turning Batman into a comedian was a recipe for disaster and thus will not be inclined to tinker with a masterpiece creation. I expect Bale and this scripting sophistication to hold up in subsequent movies, if nothing else because of the ending to this film itself .<br /><br />Batman has begun a long-awaited period of revival both as a crime fighting force to be recokned with and a box office blockbuster to see.Returns (with Michael Keaton then in the lead role).

068987474X|5.0|How many hours have you spent analyzing some guy's actions together with your best girlfriends?  After reading this book, I now know - too many!    I should say, I fully expected to hate this book.  All my dying-to-get-married friends were reading it, and I thought it would be a sort of funnier version of The Rules, totally disrespectful, even mean towards women and expecting them to behave in a certain fashion in order to land or keep a guy.    It's not that at all.  It is, exactly as it says, a no excuses guide.  But not in a mean way, in a very empowering way.  You can choose to stop wasting your time on guys who don't see how fabulous you are.  The book repeats that you are wonderful, that someone will see that, so don't waste time and energy trying to make him fall in love with you if he doesn't want to.   I think the book is very valuable for non-singles to read as well, so that instead of encouraging our friends to wait another 2 weeks for his call/another 2 months for him to declare his love/another 2 years for him to propose, you can encourage them to free themselves for someone who will like them, without all the mixed messages and wasted energy.    The book encourages us to choose to be in a relationship that totally satisfies us.  Yes, it oversimplifies, and yes, there are exceptions.  Reading it, I thought some of the advice was so obvious, but then remembered all the times I've heard friends making endless excuses for why their guy wasn't calling, spending time with them, etc.  Read it, think about successful serious relationships you've had, and attractions that didn't become relationships, and you'll see that so much of the advice in this book is spot on.
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|This CD is horrible. The song \\"BYOB\\" is especially terrible. It's not metal, its not thrash, its not anything but crap. It tries to mix a bunch of different musical styles, but they do it terribly. I can't even describe how angry I get when I listen to the song. I can listen to Dillinger Escape Plan, which is just noise to most people, but for God's sake at least they show some skill. This CD, however, is so bad it makes me cringe. I can't understand how this band is so popular, besides the fact that the entire Armenian community will support this band no matter what. No problem with that, but they are still one of the worst bands in the world in my opinion. <br /> <br />Not to mention the lyrics. I feel as though the band took a crap on a piece of paper and named it \\"Mesmerize\\". Look at the aformentioned song, for example: \\"My God is of Bible blood with pointed ears/Victorious, victorious steel/Can your spending kneel?\\" If you think that is good songwriting.... I don't know about you. It makes no sense, even if it is trying to be poetic or use metaphors. It is a text-book example of ridiculously bad writing. <br /> <br />No talent, terrible sound, horrendous lyrics. This CD is just horrible.

B000059QYB|5.0|This compilation is well worth the money.  I love every tune on this, especially the acoustic Rebel Yell and my absolute fave \\"To Be a Lover,\\" which has everything. . .a pounding rhythm, screaming background singers, wailing guitar solo, and fantastic beating up on the piano keys.  In all, it is extremely satisfying rock music.  Have mercy! <br />
B00003CXHJ|4.0|A lot of reviewers have been saying what can or can not be done by people on a submarine.  I wonder if any of them have ever been on one, or are even old enough to have been.<br /><br />There is an interview with a retired U.S. Admiral who was on S-boat submarines in WW2 (fighting the Japanese), and then after the war took command of a german U-boat that was surrendered so they could see how the technology compared with that of the allies.  He sat there and explained that it was very easy to pilot the german sub without knowing german.  He said that they didn't even put different labels on it.  This is a hollywood movie, so there are bound to be dumb things done in it, but that was not one of them, so people need to calm down a bit.  This man was the technical consultant on the film.<br /><br />It is actually really impressive, they made this movie as accurate as possible, physically building a sub for it, and designing it according to  original drawings and plans where possible.  There were actual submariners working with the actors, teaching them what buttons to push, which levers to pull, and instructing them in the correct termanology.  I was very impressed by that.<br /><br />Yes, I do certaintly agree that there is no way the sub would have been able to take that much punishment, but that is hollywood, and is to be expected in almost any action movie (so stop complaining).  That is the genre.<br /><br />Some complain that the sailors look like boy scouts and not soldiers.  Most enlisted personnel *were* just out of high school.  Late in the war, the average age of a captain got as low as 26.  This is accuracy, just like the boat, the levers and the uniforms.<br /><br />There have been criticims leveled because it portrays an American crew when the first two captures of enigmas were made by the British, and so they dismiss it as 'propaganda' which is trying to 're-write history'.  Well, again, watch the special features (and the ending credits).  They don't deny that it was first the British, infact, they have an interview with the Lt. Commander of the Royal Navy who was the man who first boarded a U-boat and retrieved the first enigma.  It is interesting, HE didn't seem to be offended.<br /><br />Remember, this is fiction.  If you watch the interviews with the writer/director, you will see that the movie really was a personal, and somewhat emotional, inquiry into just who these people were who did such amazing acts, whether they are somehow super-human, or just like everybody else.  The reason I say personal is that he spends time talking about how he wonders whether he would have been able to rise to it like all of these kids did, and concludes that while he hopes so, he doesn't know.  So, my point is this: of course it is going to be a story about Americans.  He is American, and he is trying to relate somehow, to understand in some small degree.  That is much easier when the culture is the same.  It is not American 'imperialistic propiganda' or anything else that made it an American crew - it likely just facillitated his inquiry.  (That said: there was an enigma that was captured by the us navy later on, so having an American crew is not that bad anyway)<br /><br />Some people were offended that the German crew murders survivors of a wreck, and thus state that this is supposed to make us hate the Germans, wave our US flags, and be more into the film.  I could not disagree more.  What it showed is that they were human too.  They did not want to do it, and only did it on their Captain's orders, who says that it is a standing order from the Fuhrer.  Even after he gives the order they are hesitating, and looking at each other uncomfortably, and only do it after he yells again.  That humanizes the German crew, not the other way around.  Honestly, it makes them seem like victims of the war, just like all the kids in the allied military were.<br /><br />I liked the movie a fair bit, but it wasn't a 5-star.  I defend it here because what people are saying about it is so unthinking and ludicrous.  I don't know, it seems like people want to be offended and are just looking for excuses.  And in that case, nothing that I say, and not truth itself, would make a difference..  I defend it here because what people are saying about it is so unthinking and ludicrous.

B0007Y4TVU|3.0|Mezmerize is a good album, with several good songs, reminiscent of \\"steal this album\\", with one major fault... and most of you have it pegged. Daron had too much freedom, and too much input. What do you think of when you think SOAD? Political? Metal? Schizo? Me too. I don't think of songs about watching baseball games as a kid or robot voices. It's like Roger Waters turning Pink Floyd into his own personal project (Final Cut). It's just not good. <br />I don't mind if it songs sound poppy. Pop songs with a point are rare, and these songs may be radio friendly, but because of certain taboo words and subject matter, they will never get airplay (unless clear channel stops shoving complete $@%!! down our throats). <br />Another complaint is that (once again you pegged it) it's too short. Unless Hypnotic, the second in the \\"double album\\", has more than 40 minutes, this could have easily come out as a single disc (maybe without the hollywood baseball song). <br />Face it, putting out two discs is a way to make a lot of cash, and system did it. Screw artistic vision, the music is the vision, not the way it's released. <br />But, totally get this if you have an extra $20 burning a hole in your neverending pocket, most of the songs are great.
0684852756|5.0|I can still so clearly remember the afternoon I first read the Hanif Kureishi story that became INTIMACY---in the New Yorker in 1997 or 1998---and how I was so elated by it that I phoned an editor friend in another city who, like me, was a single mother whose children were officially grown up (but still trying to grow up) just as we were two women who were officially grown up (but still trying to grow up) and although we both belonged to a category of readers who should despise this book (women who've sometimes had a rough time in their relationships with sexually charismatic men) we just couldn't stop talking about it and singing its praises. But we didn't have to want a man like this in our lives (not any more, we didn't) to value that kind of man's incarnation as a character in an extraordinary novel.  <br /> <br />It's true that when INTIMACY was first published in Britain, it ignited a firestorm in both Kureishi's family and in the press, with one of its many critics denouncing it as \\"this short, odious book.\\" And it's also true that INTIMACY'S  narrator, Jay (a scriptwriter) is wilful, childish, narcissistic and wild. And, yes, odious too; he even does the occasional parent-teacher interview in his \\"latest favourite suit, on acid\\" and even though he's the father of very young children he keeps Ecstasy, LSD, and an old bottle of amyl nitrate in the fridge. But he's also a man who is tender, introspective, witty, and exuberantly honest. Herein lies the book's reckless charm and elating momentum. <br /> <br />INTIMACY also joins a long line of 20th-century novels that tell the story of men leaving home, beginning with the husband in John Updike's Too Far to Go, a man who, before leaving his wife and children, repairs hinges and latches: \\"a Houdini making things snug before his escape...\\"  <br /> <br />In novels by Richard Stern and Bernard Malamud and any number of other male writers on the theme of men who are also ambivalently on the run, the women being left behind are dark-haired, enduring, and sexually withholding, while the mistresses are fair-haired, adoring, and quick to offer sexual comfort. These blondes travel with a vast array of cosmetic and herbal supplies; in the case of Jay's mistress Nina--a shrewdly wistful phantom forever kept off-stage in her pale, hippie clothes--it's a bag stocked with nipple cream, tapes of the sound of the sea, postcards of cats, packets of camomile tea, and other bits of the equipment so vital to \\"mobile girls.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Soon we will be like strangers,\\" Jay tells us, speaking of Susan, the mother of his children. But no, they can never be that. \\"Hurting someone is an act of reluctant intimacy. We will be dangerous acquaintances with a history.\\" Jay also fears dying--he's invited to more funerals than dinner parties--and so has little use for women who are also too quickly growing older, as he makes clear when he ironically asks what's wrong with maturity. \\"Think of the conversations I could have--about literature and bitterness--with a forty-year-old!\\"  <br /> <br />Susan belongs in this age range, but in spite of his making her his muse by turning her (via metaphor) into a blank page--she's at the bottom of the stairs in her white T-shirt and white slippers, looking \\"so white I could write on her\\"--his evocations of her can also convey his love for her, as in the following scene when he's moved by her enthusiasm as she kisses their children: \\"When we really talk, it is about them, something they have said or done, as if they are a passion no one else can share or understand.\\" <br /> <br />During his last night with his family, Jay experiences the outside world as both ominous and alluring. But mostly ominous: \\"Outside, the dark leaves on the trees flap in the wind like hundreds of long green tongues, the branches knocking at me.\\" He dreads leaving his sons, two \\"fierce and ebullient\\" little boys who are never named--this is one of Kureishi's many brilliant strokes--two wild boys who careen through the novel, adding to both its anguish and its comedy.  <br /> <br />Jay says of the three-year-old, \\"I wonder when I will sleep beside him again, if ever. He has a vicious kick and a tendency, at unexpected moments, to vomit in my hair. But he can pat and stroke my face like a lover. His affectionate words and little voice are God's breath to me.\\" This has a parent's narcissism in it, true, but it's also incredibly tender. And yet in the incredibly skilfully abridged version of INTIMACY that appeared in The New Yorker, a few lines down from this adoring tribute Jay is on the threshold of his front door, the fresh wind sweeping through him as one of the more compelling of his inner voices commands, \\"Go. You must go.\\" <br />  <br />This is where the novel should have ended, on page 92. It would have been a novella then, but it would have been the right thing to keep it emotionally and lyrically dynamic. Instead it goes on for another twenty-six pages, and the line that follows the powerful \\"Go. You must go,\\" is almost criminally banal: \\"I am kicking over the traces.\\" Along with a few other lacklustre passages, this is one of the relatively few disappointments in what is otherwise a vivid and fearless novel.  <br /> <br />At times it's also as if the war between Jay's id and his superego has triggered a war in the syntax, which is sometimes formal and Victorian, sometimes the Kiplingesque English of Jay's father, sometimes London street slang.  <br /> <br />But whatever its deficiencies, INTIMACY is an important and weirdly thrilling book, reminding us (as we occasionally do need reminding) how honourable that OTHER war is: the war between what's most worthy and what's most alive. <br />
B0006L16N8|2.0|Is it me, or was this advertised to us, the public, as a rock record? All reviews proclaimed this to be Coldplay's rock album, which may be because U2 is still considered rock. The songs on this album are the weakest that coldplay have done. The only beat to speak of was stolen from newer bands like the killers and interpol, which was stolen from artists before them (notice the drums on these songs sound like the 80's revival bands that are SOOO popular right now). But I'm not going to complain about the beat, because it's the only thing that keeps me awake. Coldplay seem to be capitolizing on the fact that housewives enjoy smooth boring mucic that they can ignore. <br />Coldplay always had smooth slow songs, but they were always interesting or heartfelt, this just sounds sterile and safe. Copies of past hits (speed of sound) run rampid throughout the disc. Blah Blah Blah. I know I'm negative, no need to tell me, but I'm also honest and tired of hearing the same stuff repackaged and sold to the public. <br />Magazines also mentioned \\"Stadium\\" in their reviews, the only thing stadium about this is the constant lighter waving.
0312995423|2.0|I like Dan Brown I really do. I had read all of his books except for the Digital Fortress so when I picked it up I a lot of expectations from it. Boy did this book let me down. It is only a so-so book with passable writing and a lot of factual mistakes. For a supposedly super-intelligent cryptographer with an IQ of 170 Susan Fletcher is amazingly stupid. She can't seem to grasp the most elementary things. She takes hours to make the most obvious connections. It is not just her, every single character in this book is badly drawn, they are barely even one dimensional. Their needs, motivations are never explained. The dialogue is just passable.  <br /> <br />Apart from the 'literary' mistakes Digital Fortress has too many factual errors. This was the biggest let down for me. I had been particularly excited about this book because I have always been interested in cryptology. But Dan Browns research is pathetic. He has very little idea what he is talking about. For example -  <br />1. The architecture of TRNSLTR is highly improbable, 3 million chips arranged in parallel would defeat the purpose of parallel computing. Just too many machine cycles would be wasted routing the data.  <br />2. The so called Caesar square was not used by Caesar actual. Caesar is often acknowledged as the father of modern cryptology but that is because he invented the Caesar shift. A mono-alphabetic substitution cipher (A=B, B=C etc). <br />3. Susan Fletcher gasps that an unbreakable code is an impossibility. Quantum Cryptography (which uses the spin states of photons to encrypt information) essentially guarantees unbreakable codes (at least according current physics). <br /> <br />This is just a sample of the many, many errors Dan Brown makes. If you want to read a good book on cryptology go read Neal Stephenson's Cryptonomincon which is a far better book.

B000089RV6|5.0|I am not really sure what the fuss is about the packaging. Yes its cardbord but its almost mini-lp style and the pictures and the essay are nice touches. If you want the older CD releases they are still widely available and not hard to get. I tend to like these new remasters as they give you the LP feel with the CD sound so stop gripping! The record is great and although I much prefer Bon over Brian, Brian and the rest of the band are PERFECT on this album. This is ACDC at their absolute peak and should be bought by everybody who likes true Rock and Roll. 20 million records have been sold in the United States alone. ACDC, I and legions of fans around the world sulute you!!
B000056K04|4.0|I am really torn with this CD. On one hand, I am with the crowd that really dislikes this release because of its mainstream approach. The idea that mainstream pop producer Glen Ballard took the place of the beloved Steve Lillywhite was a crushing blow as well. Lastly, the very idea that the band had little collaboration together with this release takes away from that authentic DMB feel. But, on the other hand, I have to say that Everyday is quite good. I will say that Ballard did a great job producing this release. Each song has a tight feel to it, and even though its a little more mainstream than the past works, the musicianship is excellent for each song. I would still recommend DMB's older works over Everyday, but give it a chance.
B00005JNJT|5.0|\\"Batman Begins\\" is impressive! Christian Bale is excellent as Bruce Wayne / Batman. Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman led a solid supporting cast that has Katie Holmes, Cillian Murphy, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, and Ken Watanabe in it. Christopher Nolan's directing is impressive. The screenplay by Nolan and David S. Goyer (who also wrote the Blade Movies) and the story by Goyer is brilliant. The music by James Newton Howard & Hans Zimmer is very impressive. The cinematography (Oscar nominated) by Wally Pfister is excellent. The film editing by Lee Smith is excellent. The casting by John Papsidera & Lucinda Syson is excellent. The production design by Nathan Crowley is very impressive. The art direction by Peter Francis, Stuart Kearns, Paul Kirby, Simon Lamont, Steven Lawrence, David Lee, Patrick Lumb, Shane Valentino, Su Whitaker is very impressive. The set decoration by Paki Smith is very impressive. The costume design by Lindy Hemming is very impressive. This is one of the year's best and one of the best comic book movies in recent history since \\"Spider-Man 2\\" (2004).
B00005JMAH|2.0|I'm a harry potter fan, not a huge one, but one that orders the books before they come out and spends about 3 days reading them, not matter how big they are. So, i loved the first two Harry Potter movies. I was dissapointed when they left out very big scenes, and they didn't seem to flow together. This movie, however, was a complete discrace! I LOVED the book, absolutely, but i was appalled at what was taken out of the movie. <br /> <br /> To me, a necessity was the explanation of how the map relates to the whole Padfoot, Prongs, Wormtail, and Moony as the four friends. Lupin and Black were continually going on about how they seemed to know EVERYTHING about the map (\\"the map never lies\\" etc etc) which they should, seeing that they made it, but to anyone who hasen't read the books wouldn't know that, so they wouldn't have any clue as to why they say that sort of stuff. Even my brother (who hasn't read the books) was very confused, saying stuff like \\"how does he know?\\" and stuff.  <br /> <br />Also, the ending was HORRIBLE. The whole deal with the Quidditch cup, and House Cup and everything was completely out of it. Its like it didn't exist! The first thing is that Harry got his broom in the middle, BEFORE he met Sirius and all that sort of stuff. All of the stuff at the ending (besides the whole time turning and stuff) was taken out and i felt it was a complete injustice to us who actually LIKE the books. <br /> <br />Also, i found there was a lot of scenes that were COMPLETELY uneeded. There were plenty of just random scenery scenes, where they would show a bird just fly and get \\"killed\\" by the tree, completely unecessary, and uneeded.  <br /> <br />I also felt that the acting wasn't all that good either. I felt that Uncle Vernon, Dudley, and Aunt Petunia did a horrible job at the table with Aunt Marge, the only scene with the muggles. I felt that scene was very poorly acted and constructed. I could sense a sort of beginning where they wished to make it seem sort ofcaotic, but it didn't work at all, it seemed, almost, as if Harry blew up his aunts every day. <br /> <br />Basically, more than once i felt like stopping the movie and filling in the HUGE and FREQUENT holes so everyone can understand. <br /> <br />While i was ver dissapointed at the amount that was not included, i felt that the movie was very pleasurable. I think that if you're not a big Harry Potter fan, and don't really feel the need to have movies relate back to the book (if you've even read it) then this would be a good movie for you to watch.
1400032717|4.0|A wonderfully smart and interesting book.  Mark Haddon's protagonist is a combination of Benjy (from William Faulkner's Sound and Fury) and Rain Man (from the movie of the same name).  Christopher John Francis Boone, the protagonist/narrator takes us on a breath-taking ride through the sometimes brilliant yet often  tormented mind of an autistic individual. The sense of right and wrong exhibited by Christopher, his moral values, and his insistence on protecting the weaker  of God's creatures,  will touch every conceivable emotion. This book is well worth your time.<br /><br />E. Perry<br /><br />Toronto
B00005JNBQ|3.0|Napoleon Dynomite is a wanna-be funny movie in my opinion. Of course, i seem to be the only one who thinks that. Everyone else seems to think its a wonderful movie. My school is no different than the next one, if you go there, you've got to either learn to love the movie, or get used to people quoting it, wearing the shirts, and all that stuff 24/7. To me, i didn't think it was all that great. Honestly, i thought it was a movie that was just plain stupid. I only give it 3 stars b/c there were a few funny parts to it. But you be the judge. My recomendation is to rent it first to see if you like it.
B00005JNJT|5.0|\\"Batman Begins is not better than Tim Burtons 1989 epic. One reason is that this movie takes its self to seriously, There is no sence of adveture or fun. Batman begins may have taken what was missing frrom the old movies but he forgot to give us the colors, the fun dialoge and the joy of Batman here we have a scary, dark drama. I perfer the first two\\" <br /> <br />Someone said this in a review on this site. This person just doesnt know about the real batman. This isnt based on the comics. Its a graphic novel. There isn't suppose to be fun....its very serious and is suppose to be dark. This movie has NOTHING to do with the other four...it is a clean slate. NO ONE SHOULD COMPARE THIS MOVIE WITH THE OTHER FOUR....IT ISNT RIGHT TO DO SO. This is how the story should of been told from the very beginning. Read a book....get a clue.....best batman ever...first one of its kind and NEVER think of this movie with the others....5 freakin stars baby!!!!!!
B000002UJQ|4.0|Seriously, Karma Police has got to be one of the best songs ever written  ! I don t know a lot of musicians like me (in their thirties) who do not wish they d written such  a beautiful song...If you haven t tried yet, just give Radiohead a chance, and enough with this  \\"they re so cool they deserve to be hated\\". Seriously !
B0007XT7V8|5.0|theory of a deadman, gasoline is an awesome album!! every song on it is wonderful.its rare you find cds where you like every song on it but this is one of those kind of cds! their first album was also excellent.you can really relate to the songs.its actually hard to pick a favorite because they are all so good! some of the ones that really touch me are hello lonely and since you've been gone but they are all equally awesome! this is one cd i will never get tired of.
B000065U1N|4.0|I have a somewhat unique perspective on this movie.  The man in the movie played as Grimesy was one of my drill sergeants in basic training.  He pretty much required all of us to read the book to get us ready for our inevitable confrontation with the realities of war. <br /> <br />The reason he made us read the book was not to glorify his actions but to show what the consequences of arrogance in battle can be.  The book does not portray Rangers in a favorable light.  The Rangers saw themselves as elite but Delta was not at all impressed. <br /> <br />The real man behing the Grimesy character was SPC John Stebbins.  His name was changed in the movie because he is serving 20 years for being a child molester.  What he told us at the time was that the only thing most Rangers are elite at is their arrogance. <br /> <br />The movie misses out on this portion of the book.  Ridley Scott should have done a more thorough job of communicating what was one of the major themes of the book.  This is why I rate this movie as 4 stars instead of 5. <br />   <br />The movie does a great job in portraying the battle scenes described in Mark Bowden's book.  It captures all of the intensity of the 18 hour ordeal that my drill sergeant spoke of.   <br /> <br />Do not look to this movie for a detailed explanation of what all happened in Somalia or why we were there in the first place.  All it portends to do is bring to light the story of a military mission that few would have otherwise known.  That is it. <br /> <br />I have seen several reviews of people complaining about the absence of a plot.  If you want a plot look for Rain Man.  This is history there are no plots only facts.  The facts are very accurate according to the reports of the soldiers involved. <br /> <br />It is essentially a very gory shoot em up movie because that is what happened in real life.  If he really wanted to gross you out he could have shown the Rangers bodies being dragged through the streets. <br /> <br />Sorry if the warlords and their forces are not portrayed in a positive light.  Sometimes it is hard thing to do especially when you are dealing with pieces of human scum.
0312995423|4.0|What would happen if everyone suddenly had access to an unbreakable code?  This is the nightmare scenario that the National Security Agency (NSA) faces in this lightning-fast thriller.  The NSA is tasked with breaking the codes of the nation's enemies to protect the nation's security.  When a new, supposedly unbreakable code emerges, the NSA races to recover the security codes to keep the code a secret.  From the streets of Seville to the NSA headquarters, the tension builds as time runs out, until a climax that almost destroys the nation's security forever.<br /><br />Dan Brown writes with authority, and much of what he describes is quite believable.  Unfortunately, the climatic ending turns out to be the weakest part of the story.  In order to build the tension, Brown's characters, which to this point have been portrayed as quite intelligent, suddenly develop an epidemic of stupidity.  Their inability to solve the final riddle quickly actually detracts from the impact of the conclusion.  Otherwise, this is a thrilling story, the book equivalent to the summer blockbuster movie:  Full throttle entertainment, but very little depth.
B0009AM5JA|5.0|Not sure what's not to like about this album.  To be honest, it did take me a couple listens, but Coldplay may be the U2 of our time.  With music that is reminiscent of U2, the beatles, the 80's sound, plus Chris Martin's voice, it is music to make you think.  Tracks &quot;Fix You&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; are favourites.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|Descript words take the place of boorish visuals in veteran filmmaker Mike Nichols' modern, star-driven masterpiece \\"Closer.\\"    If we'd seen Jude Law and Julia Roberts, or Clive Owen and Natalie Portman (or any variation thereof) carry out any of the acts verbally described on screen, the film would have promptly found itself in tipple-X territory.  Instead, Nichols opts for a far more abrasive, far more vivid, portrayal of the harmful effects of too much sex with the wrong (and right?) people through the use of dialogue rather than visuals.  In this respect, \\"Closer\\" excels on screen where books have outrivaled films for decades.  Using dialogue rather than action exalts \\"Closer\\" from an over-powering, abrasive sex-farce, into a vivid representation of malice and sexuality as cohesive, and sometimes inseparable, human traits.    With \\"Closer\\" we flicker back to how the cavemen may have reacted so many millions of years ago to unpleasant situations.  Here, the most basic human conditions are placed under a microscope.  Rather than spears and fur loin cloths, our leading characters sport Gucci suits and divorce papers; they're the same basic, jealous beasts of the old world, with a modern stealthy wisdom of vocabulary and spite that allow for a sentence to hit harder than any deadly boulder or bat.    \\"Closer\\" explores jealousy and the best weapon and indulgence that humans embrace: sex.  Each of the four major players (it's difficult to put one before the other in importance, as they seem to share equal parts of the screen and plot) carry out brilliant performances (wrongfully snubbed by the Oscars), from Jude Laws' quirky but highly sexual depiction of Dan, Julia Roberts' effortless portrayal of (seemingly) levelheaded photographer Anna, Natalie Portman's role as young and eager Alice, or Clive Owen's remarkable depiction of the scathing doctor Larry.  Each character is alive and pulsing on screen.  This is a case of four potentially great (and already super-famous) actors giving their best delivery at the same time, thanks to the wisdom of Mike Nichols and the hyper-real dialogue and story of screenwriter Patrick Marber (who not only wrote the play that the film is based upon, but also penned the script).    The cinematography is kept tight on the characters' faces, but distant and isolated when it needs to be.  The movie reacts in very much the same way a stage play might: with long shots, lengthy scenes in the same settings, soliloquies and homilies filling the screen time and again with words and more words.  But Nichols does a flawless job rendering the film as a piece of cinema, while incorporating everything refined from the pages of a novel and the stage of the theater.    A detail is not left unexamined.  Our characters destroy themselves and one another before our very eyes thanks to the realistic motives of desire and jealousy... the very vindictive grains of life that make humans hard to live with... or without.    Grade: A+
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It is GREAT and after the Movie, they better bring it back!!!!
B0007Y08QA|4.0|The first 15 minutes of Brad Anderson's dark dissension into the inexplicable realm of psychosis, called \\"The Machinist,\\" will intoxicate you with shear disbelief... disbelief that actor Christian Bale has whittled his already lean frame down 63 pounds to become a true walking skeleton (weighing in at just 120 pounds).  Never before has an actor gone to such lengths to fill a role -- most recently Renée Zellweger gained weight for her role as Bridget Jones, and Tom Hanks gained and lost 50 pounds for 2000's \\"Cast Away,\\"  but Bale takes the cake (or rather, passed on the cake).    The film itself is as dark and grim as Bale's body.  His withered body represents what can happen to a man that hasn't slept for a year.  It's the film's driving ambition to keep the reasons for Trevor Reznik's (Bale's) physical and mental declivity a secret, until the very end when all the strange behavior becomes clear.    Director Anderson does a fine job depicting a boundless downfall with intriguing support and detail.  As a factory machinist, Trevor Reznik's fatigued mind and body is a means for trouble to happen and an invitation for catastrophe.  When a fellow worker is maimed by fault of Reznik, the dark playing field of paranoia rears itself as he finds his fellow workers closing in on him... or so it seems.  The film loses its fluidity and becomes more ridged and seamed-together (like a patchwork quilt of images) that make less and less sense as it rolls on, until the culmination and climax gives way to the truth.  With such a pristine and tightly controlled climax, we don't mind the discombobulating that precedes it.    The score is catchy and similar to Hitchcock films of old -- and Anderson points out such on the DVD's extras.  In fact, the whole film screams Hitchcock, but in small enough doses that the movie avoids becoming a pastiche.  Rather, this film is what Hitchcock may have evolved into creating today if he were immortal (and in many ways he is).    The film, thoughstrong, has its flaws, like lack of supporting character development.  Jennifer Jason Leigh plays a convincing prostitute (I mean this as a compliment), Stevie, who is strong and nimble though vulnerable.  She doesn't transcend being a casual acquaintance when she could have played a more pivotal role, perhaps advancing the plot that seems to lull at times and focus only on our leading man.  Some back-story could have been expanded upon to better elevate the expectations that build, and truly depend, on the final climax.  In the end, Anderson and Bale do well to include all the ingredients for a wallop of an ending.    Grade: B-
B0002Y4T92|5.0|If you like guitars and concerts, get yourself a big TV and Clapton's Crossroads DVD. Unlike his brother, Jimmy Vaughn seems to have to work hard at making music. Clapton and Santana, full of love and life, lose themselves in the music.  Santana does what he loves and loves what he does. Clapton again proves his versatility; he can play and sing anything he wants to. Clapton's the perfect compliment to any musician because he understands the emotion.
B000002UZ1|5.0|The beatles are my favorite band and are the greatest band of all time and helpedto make rock bands more popular.  I'll have to say I could not get into a whole lot of the red album stuff.  I do not care very much for bubble gum rock.  In 1967 the Beatles finally started sounding like real rock.  I had to buy this because their are so many songs I love on here. <br /> <br />        Hey Jude is one of the Beatles first long songs and it was very succesful.  Let it be is a song you need to close your eyes to when you listen to it.  Lady Madonna is a good song that Paul Mcartney sings.  Revolution was the hardest rock and roll thing on this product.  The opening of John Lennon screaming is really awesome and cool.  Come together is like my second favorite song on there and I even like the Aerosmith version.  The long and winding road is a good underated song.  Hello, goodbye I am finally hearing on the radio.  What can I say,  they were the greatest band of all time and the biggest impact on rock bands.  Buy it if you love great rock'n roll.  God bless you and have a great day.  God bless America.
B0009K7ROI|4.0|There are several very nice tunes on Road Dogs- 40 Days, Kona Village and You'll Survive among them. The instrumental Brumwell's Beat is as good as anything the Bluesbreakers have ever done. The CD may be a little message heavy at the expense of allowing the band to jam a little more. Make your own decision.
0060955775|5.0|Though, there is no comparison between \\"The Alchemist\\" and this novel, the end message of both the books are the same. It is finding your true self. <br /> <br />Veronika decides to kill herself and finds herself in a mental hospital. She is told by the doctors that in the attempt of suicide, she has permanently damaged her heart. So, she has only a week or so to live. <br /> <br />Veronika decides to live the week as she always wanted to live but couldn't when she was in the outer world. She wants to shred all the masks that human being wear when they move in the otherwise normal world. <br /> <br />She finds that the mental hospital where she is living is more true than the outer world. The writing and style in which the book is written is thought-provoking. <br /> <br />Paulo Coelho should be credited with this book. He surley has a winner on hand.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|MACHINIST is one of those pure art films that the makers must have known would be seen by very few people when they were making it, but they made it out of love of the film media and acting for it's own sake.<br /><br />The movie is great at what it is, but not something you will probably add to your DVD collection or watch more than once.<br /><br />I don't know to be impressed with Bale for having the discipline to starve himself to such a degree -or- question his sanity as an actor who apparently gets totally immersed in his roles.<br /><br />His physical transformation must have been a personal challenge for himself since the budget on this film could not possibly have made it finanically tempting to starve himself to the point of looking like a Holocaust survivor.

B0007GAEW6|5.0|I thought it was going to be impossible to top \\"De-Loused In the Comatorium\\", but somehow, The Mars Volta managed to do it. If you enjoyed either Tremulant EP, or De-loused In the Comatorium, you'll love this album. The album takes you on a musical journey. No other band around is anything like this band. The Mars Volta is simply amazing, and I hope they continue to make great albums, such as This one. My email is ATDIhendrix@gmail.com and I am boomstick on Transient Jet lag.
B000002H6C|5.0|It is too bad Metallica turned commercial after this release.  On the other hand, it could have been because they realized they'd just finished the best thrash album of all time and nothing they could do in that genre could top this.  I didn't know Lars could hammer the skins at the pace he does throughout this album, especially on \\"Dyer's Eve\\".  While the Black Album is nothing compared to the early stuff, you can't really blame the band for selling out.  They'd done it all with this album.  It was time to move on. <br /> <br />\\"Blackened\\" is the best first song on any of their albums they have done, with the possible exception of \\"Battery\\".  It is not the most entertaining song on the album, but still a great blasting intro to what is to come. <br /> <br />The title track kills.  It is a brutal condemnation of the American legal system as it stood in the late 80s and how it stands now.  It is a good nine minutes long, but every minute counts.  There is no filler on this track, nor is there any on the album. <br /> <br />Eye of the Beholder is an attack on our very constitution and how hypocritical politicians will bend it for their own purposes.  Although the beat stays the same throughout the song, it has never become boring for me. <br /> <br />This brings me to One, the best Metallica song ever written.  Imagine Fade to Black intermingled with Fight Fire With Fire.  That is One.  Only Master of Puppets can compare to this brutal thrash ballad, and I would say even that is found wanting. <br /> <br />The Shortest Straw is the weakest link on this album, but it is still pretty strong, and the way it flows into Harvester of Sorrow is incredible. <br /> <br />Harvester of Sorrow is another favorite on this album, and links with Dyer's Eve as a song condemning those who brainwash the young to agree with their views. <br /> <br />The Frayed Ends of Sanity starts out sounding like a pirate song, but it becomes clear later on that it is a song about insanity (if you could not guess from the title).  It is a good song, but perhaps would have been better placed on the Master of Puppets album due to its content. <br /> <br />To Live Is To Die is not as good, in my opinion, as Orion off Master of Puppets, but it is still better than The Call of Ktulu, which gets repetitive.  However, it is homage to the late and great Cliff Burton (the few lyrics are his), so apart from the great music, it is worth a listen just for that. <br /> <br />Finally, Metallica finishes with the most brutally fast song on the album, \\"Dyer's Eve\\".  This is positively the best finisher on any of Metallica's albums, and one of my all-time thrash favorites. <br /> <br />If you're into thrash, and you don't have this album, you are missing out on some of the best stuff ever played.  Some might not want to purchase this because it feeds the pockets of the \\"sell-outs\\", but if you grow up a little and ever feel the need to buy one of Metallica's albums, make it this one.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This movie is so beautiful--full of dreamlike mysteries.I'd like to point out, however, that many of the mysterious elements are only mysterious to non-Japanese. Like our movies, this one is full of allusions to religious and folkloric traditions that a native takes for granted. For me, the wonder is heightened by my mental comparisons--what is common to both traditions and what is new and mysterious to me? What are the elements that I need to explore further? This film made me wish I had more time to do some research or maybe even visit Japan . . .
B00008OLYN|5.0|Well, Morningrise and Orchid would be better if they didn't have the underproduced bonus tracks, but Damnation is still a great album.  Any Opeth fan...any metal fan...any prog fan...heck, any MUSIC fan should not be without this album.  One reviewer said this was \\"an interesting album but boring\\"...okay...how is an interesting album boring?  It may not be as heavy as Deliverance or Blackwater Park or anything else Opeth has done, but it still has that Opeth touch.  Crazy time signatures, shifts from one mood to the next WITHOUT relying on going from loud to soft like they do sometimes on previous albums...this album is anything but boring.  The problem is you cannot sit back and let it wash over you as with the heavier Opeth songs.  You have to actively listen to it, which is what you should be doing with any Opeth release anyway.  There are lots of subtle changes on all their albums, but this album is where the most subtle are found.  Some might call this pseudo-intellectual, but I call it great music. <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor.  Buy this album, and see why most people agree that this is one of Opeth's finest efforts.
B0006L0LOS|5.0|This movie proves once and for all that movie critics are morons!! Despite what you may have read, this is a terrific movie that's fun and hip from start to finish. Berry is slick and wonderfully feline, the story flows well and is entertaining to watch. No, it's not Shakespeare, but it's not meant to be. It's a serious good time if you're willing to relax about the idea of Catwoman being a little beyond human. The extra feature on the history of Catwoman is extremely entertaining as well, especially if you're a fan of the old 60's Batman TV show. All-in-all be your own judge. Willingly suspend your disbelief and just sit back and enjoy.
B0000584V3|5.0|Those of you who have seen my review of Deliverance, the album directly after this one, already know I was in disbelief when I heard that Opeth had released better albums.  Then I got Blackwater Park. <br /> <br />Right from the first track, I knew I was in for something at least on par with Deliverance.  By track 4, I knew it was better.  Opeth is the only band I would recommend to any metal-lover; they are the most accessible metal band out there.  Metal fans may or may not like the death metal growls on this album, but the musical technicality and composition takes anyone's breath away.  Even prog fans can get something out of Opeth...if they start with Damnation. <br /> <br />This album would still be five stars without it, but I thought I would give mention to \\"The Drapery Falls\\".  This ranks right up there with \\"Deliverance\\" and \\"Windowpane\\" as my favorite Opeth song.  I now own every Opeth album, and every single one of them is nothing short of awesome.  But this one is my favorite, and probably will remain so unless Opeth tops it with another release. <br /> <br />This is also my favorite album at the moment.  Opeth has risen to replace Sabbath as my favorite band.  They have successfully brought something new to metal, a skill I have not heard since Metallica went down the tubes.  Face it.  If you're into metal and do not have this album, buy it now.  Opeth is the new face of metal.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Let me start off by saying that this a good album. I fully agree with most people who say that this album doesn't come close to the classics such as 'Piece of Mind' and 'Powerslave'. But this is still one heck of a good album. 'Wildest Dreams' is a descent opener to this album that has a classic feel. I agree that 'Rainmaker' is a radio-friendly song, but it is still an excellent song with a catchy chorus and good guitar solos. 'No More Lies' is another good song. Many complain that 'No More Lies' has a repetitive chorus and it does, but it actually works good with this song just how the repetitive chorus in 'The Evil that Men Do' works good. Anyways, Maiden makes good use of the triple guitar in 'No More Lies'. 'Montsegur' starts out very promising, but it then gets very repetitive. Its still an ok song that is similar to 'The Mercenary' from Brave New World, as both songs start out heavy but just get boring after about a minute. 'Dance of Death' is another good song, third best in the album. It follows the formula that a lot of the new Maiden songs have, which is to start out soft and have the heaviness kick in a few minutes into the song. 'Gates of Tomorrow' is a descent song. Its  a song that sounds like something of the 'No Prayer for the Dying' album. Its an ok song that I find myself skipping from time to time. 'New Frontier' is another song that is ok, but doesn't really stand out. 'Paschendale' is THE masterpiece of the album. The instrumental work in 'Paschendale' matches the story of the young soldier who is waiting to die in the trenches of WWI. 'Face in the Sand' is a good song, with a nice build up in the intro and some good lyrics. 'Age of Innosence' is also a good song, but it isn't anything special. The album closes off with 'Journeyman' which is a a nice soft piece, but don't let the \\"softness\\" scare you away because 'Journeyman' is an excellent song and in my opinion the second best song on the album. To conclude, this is a good album and worth your money. It is nice to have an album like this released during these times where music is undergoing a crisis with cRAP and terrible bands such as Slip Knot, Papa Roach, and all those other bands that just scream  and have no musical talent what so ever. Anyways, if you haven't done so yet, go pick up this album, its worth every penny.
B00009W8N2|5.0|Opeth's debut is nothing short of brutal.  That said, if you liked Damnation and want to get a taste of Opeth's more metallic sound, DO NOT pick up this album.  Buy Blackwater Park instead. <br /> <br />However, those of us who actually enjoy the deep-throated growls that Akerfeldt has to offer should definitely pick this one up.  The growls, as another reviewer pointed out, are different, just as the vocals on \\"Kill Em All\\" are different from those on \\"...And Justice For All\\".  In this case, it sounds as though Akerfeldt's style was different and it isn't a matter of the production.  I could be wrong on that point though, but production-wise, there is very little wrong with this album. <br /> <br />Music-wise, there is nothing wrong with this album.  The pinnacle is reached with \\"Forest of October\\", one of the best songs of Opeth's career.  Also, the short instrumentals allow the listener to take a quick break from all the brutality and sit back and hum along. <br /> <br />If Roger Waters could growl, maybe he would have released albums like this.  This album is Floyd meets Death Metal, and the result is amazing. <br /> <br />And if you can't stand death metal, there's always Damnation by the same band.  The vocals on that are completely clean, despite the title. <br /> <br />Oh.  The bonus track is awful.  If you can, get the version without it.  It is unnecessary, and you'll just find yourself hitting the stop button a lot on your stereo.
0679745203|3.0|A story that pulls you in gently and captivates but whose ending trails off a bit unpurposefully. Well-crafted writing, lovely to read, and definitely worth reading -- it's just that upon finishing it you may be left feeling that something necessary has been left undone.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|This is one of those movies that I watched over & over again as a child/teen - I not only loved the story, but the music was amazing as well.<br /><br />This is a story that, unfortunately, makes as much sense today as when it was written.  I say \\"unfortunately\\", because it's about the love between two people who society has determined should not be together because they are not of the same ethnicity (although I must say, we've come a long way re: this within the last several decades!).<br /><br />West Side Story is set in a time & area where gangs are prevalent, and the people seem relatively poor.  In this setting, 2 teens fall in love - but the boy belongs to one gang, and the girl's brother belongs to a rival gang.  Plus, with the difference in ethnicity, how can this love ever blossom?<br /><br />I must say, if you believe in love, the ending is one that will haunt you forever!<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys musicals.  If you haven't seen it already, you are in for a real treat!
B00005JNBQ|2.0|Jon Heder as Napolean is dry, low key, and funny for 5 minutes. If only he had a script and a director to work with he could have been funny for the remaining time of the movie. The first half is cute because of all the quirky supporting characters (brother Kip, Uncle Rico...)but the second half is stupid because there's hardly any plot developement and literally no ending! It's just people moving around, doing dumb things, and Napoleon saying, \\"Freakin' Idiot!\\" for the last 30 minutes.
B00005JNJT|5.0|First off, let me state that I am a fan of the first, and even the second, Batman movies with Michael Keaton.  However, this movie is truly the best and truest Batman adaptation.  Batman in this film was ridiculously scary, as he was meant to be.  You get a real sense of the horror he inspires in Gotham's underworld.  The scene where he plucks Falcone's men, one by one, from the docks made me jump out of my seat.  Christian Bale's portrayal is so unbelievably good!!!  He managed to make me sympathetic to Bruce Wayne and brought real depth to the millionare playboy; Bale made him a real person with complex motivations.  Gary Oldman was so good and convincing as Gordon that I didn't even realise he was the same man who played Sirius Black!  The acting in this film was the best of all the movies and I look forward to a sequel and Nolan's interpretation of The Joker!!!
B0009HLDFU|5.0|Let me begin by stating that I was very much skeptical of this album after seeing 14.5 Hours of Foo on MTV2. But that was me being shortsighted and ignorant. <br />In Your Honor is the Foo's most lyrically consistent and cohesive effort to date. In some ways it doesn't even feel like a Foo album at all. It's head and shoulders over all of their previous efforts and as amazing sonically as it is lyrically. The \\"rock\\" disc is muscular and lean, which perfectly complements the subject matter. The \\"acoustic\\" disc is gorgeously orchestrated with beautiful soundscapes, composed of a myriad of instruments, not just the usual \\"strummy\\" and boring guitars that usual inhabit and inhibit acoustic efforts. <br />It shouldn't be a surprise that In Your Honor has an amazing momentum that isn't slowed by the transistion from the \\"rock\\" half to the \\"acoustic\\" half, and an overarching theme that works with said momentum to connect the two. Dare I say concept album? <br />Dave has said he wants this album to be the one fathers recommend to their sons years from now. Even if I'm the only one, I can't help but agree. I've already recommended it to everyone I know.
B0009PVZWI|5.0|This 2 CD set is up there with the best of the foo so far. Id even venture to say this is their best yet. I have grown up with the foo (my mom is a fan) so i have been a fan since \\"for all the cows\\" and i have heard all of their stuff. <br />   This new album takes what they have been doing for so long and experiments with what they havent done so much of in the past and combines them into one amazing set. This CD is most like the colour and shape so if you also found that CD to be as awesome as i did then you will love In Your Honor. NO foo collection is complete without it!
B00097A5HW|5.0|This album is more than what I expected.  Even down to the ballads.  In order for one to appreciate such talent ... culture must be taken into consideration.  Shakira intertwines culture and life within this album and I'd highly recommend it to anybody!!!
B0007Y08I8|5.0|I was disappointed in the DVD packaging and presentation. It came with no liner notes, and when you put the DVD in, it throws you in to this clip trying to compare movie piracy with car theft, as if they're even remotely comparable. It's pretty offensive to be called a potential thief after I just paid good money for something.    Great movie otherwise, though. A must see, and still deserves 5 stars. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are brilliant.
B0007OCG56|4.0|Spanglish was worth the wait. Adam Sandler did a wonderful job in the romatic comedy. It really showed the range of his acting ability. This was great movie to watch with someone you love. You will learn to appercaite them when the movie is over. Tia Leoni's character was a bit annoying but the rest of the cast made up for her annoyingness. Has some great suddle chemistry between Adam Penolope. Really has a story line that will pull at your heart strings. This was one of the better movies I have seen in a long time. U wish they made more like this.
B000002J1O|5.0|is it possible to enjoy any of genesis' music after peter gabriel left? i submit that it cannot.....puhleeeze.....invisible touch? land of confusion? mama? i can't dance?  wow, how big of a compost heap of songs can one man produce?  where are are you now?
B0007OCG4W|2.0|I would like to be farther away from this movie rather then closer. This movie stunk so bad I had to open the windows. Great cast gone wrong. I love Jude Law, Natalie Portman, and Julia Roberts but they should have read the script before agreeing to do this movie this could have ended some of their careers. Based on a love triangle 2 couples seem to find love with the other couples other. Hard to follow and very dull and painful to watch. How this movie was ever up for a award is beyond me. Movie skips around in time from present to past to present but with no notice and very hard to follow story line. Save your time and watch something eles this is not worth the time or energy to follow this movie. Wish it was better because just loved the casting and scenery. But story line left the movie smelling like bad eggs.
B000003S0I|5.0|32 years after its release and STILL no one has made a record this ball-breakingly heavy and beautiful. I hadn't listened to this one for many years and decided to dig it out of my basement. My two year old daughter (at the time) was transfixed by the percussion effect at the start of Lark's Tongue In Aspic Part 1. When the sinister (that word gets used a LOT in Crimson reviews) violin and guitar part came on, she backed away from the speaker. Bill Bruford's snare roll and the neck-snapping riff that starts the ball rolling actually made her run away crying in fright! (I'm not making this up- to this day she doesn't even like it when I show her the album cover!). Exiles and Book Of Saturday are more subdued. Side Two (I still have vinyl) starts with Easy Money, a song that I tend to skip from time to time. The Talking Drum builds quietly to a noisy climax which leads the way for THE HEAVIEST RIFF EVER!!! Larks Tongue In Aspic Part 2 is the standout track on this record. I have been listening to all sorts of music for nearly 30 years and have never heard anything that comes close to the demonic and totally evil images this song produces. Even if you're really not into prog but more of a metalhead, check this one out strictly for the last song. It's totally worth it.
B0006IJ5PM|3.0|This movies was suprisingly good. Bill Bob Thorton was born for this role. Best role I have seen him in a long time. It was Any given Sunday meets Varsity Blues. Soundtrack for this movie was wonderfully thought out.  Football cheography was right on target. Other then Bill Bob and Tim McGraw this was a great breakout movie for the no name actors. Based on a true story it was extremly entertaining. I hated Tim McGraws character in the beginning but throughout the movie started to have a change of heart towards him. You don't have to like football to like this movie.  <br />
B00008BXJF|4.0|Having been somewhat saddened by the breakup of the Thrak version of KC (losing Bruford and Levin), I was a bit leery about TPTB. Boy, was I wrong. This band can still make music that makes you paranoid, laugh and cry all on the same disc. Level Five is an explosive number that twists and turns. Eyes Wide Open is a nice change of pace, a song that has a nice melody and a singable chorus. Elektrik continues where Level Five leaves off, more musical juxtaposition (these guys are almost inhuman they're so tight). Facts Of Life is a quirky lyrical number not out of place here at all. Dangerous Curves is Crimson meets the bastard son of Jean-Michel Jarre. Happy With What You Have To Be Happy With is another whimsical song with semi-philosophical overtones lyrically. I would have given this 5 out of 5, but the four part The Power To Believe that permeates the record throughout doesn't quite fit with the rest of the records soundscapes. But that's just my opinion, I could be wrong. Overall an excellent record if you're new to 80's Crimson (Hell, just check 'em all out!) and if you're curious where the hell the grunge movement came from.
B00006LPER|5.0|The first time I ever saw this movie I sat with my jaw dropped throughout the entire movie. Then I continued to watch the same chanel on t.v. for weeks just trying to figure out the name of the movie. <br />This is a portrayal of love in it's rawest most human form. It is completely blind. Even to itself. The storyline is absolutely breath taking and immediatly grabbed at my chest. It is without a doubt the sickest love story I have ever seen. It is amazing to see an emotion portayed so realisticly. I will never tire of this movie.  <br />
B0000X61VE|5.0|I got this video when it first came out in 1992.  I will admit I thought it was very hard to do.  However 13 years later I find it to be the best workout ever!  The reason being is I am more experienced at working out.  I took 2 years of kickboxing which taught me proper technique for everything. Now Cindy's workout is a good workout rather than hard because I pay attention to my technique.  I don't recommend this workout for a novice.  It is too confusing.  But for anyone who  has been working out for years and wants to work off that stress - this is your exercise routine!
B00007KQA3|4.0|This adaptation of George Orwell's 1984 is relatively faithful to the novel, and creates the same type of pessimistic and frightening view of the future. Winston Smith, who is played aptly by John Hurt, works in the Ministry of Truth editing the past and present by eliminating and retracting facts from news articles. The citizens of Oceania live in constant surveillance under the authority of Big Brother. The ideals of Big Brother shun individualism and free thought; uniformity and totalitarianism rule. Winston feels a need to keep a part of his individualism, so he secretly does acts that would violate the laws of Big Brother. For instance, he secretly goes into a store and buys a journal so he can record his thoughts despite his thought that he might get caught by the Thought Police. He eventually meets and has a dangerous affair with a woman named Julia, who also rejects the notions of Big Brother. Together they try to maintain independence while living in this totalitarian society. Eventually Winston has a meeting with O'Brien, one of the men who also works in the Ministry of Truth. However, Winston does not know everything about O'Brien, and this will eventually lead to his downfall.  <br /> <br />Overall, this movie brings to life the image of a negative future that Orwell was trying to depict in his work. The city is not the rosy picture that we often see for the future; it is bleak, filled with a depressing atmosphere and people who are under the constant strain of \\"fitting into\\" the roles of citizens. John Hurt does a commendable job of bringing Winston's character to life, especially the last part of the film where his \\"transformation\\" of character is complete. Overall, this film illustrates how a society can become detrimental and horrifying when we are not allowed free thought and will.  <br />
1400043662|4.0|Murakami asked his writing class to submit plot twists and characters for a novel, daring them to be as outrageous as possible.  The following list materialized: <br /> <br />A retarded man who can interview cats <br />A 15-year-old who has an affair with a 55-year-old <br />Johnnie Walker, as a murder victim <br />Colonel Sanders, as a pimp <br />Leeches falling from the sky <br />A child who kills his father and marries his mother <br />A transvestite librarian <br />A magical stone <br />A pop song named Kafka on the Shore <br /> <br />He assured the class that he would incorporate them all into a seamless, compelling narrative.  And he did. <br /> <br />Of course that isn't how Kafka on the Shore was written.  But it reads like it, just as The Wind-up Bird Chronicle--my other dip into Murakamania--reads like another continuous, illogical but convincingly vivid hallucination.   <br /> <br />This is Murakami's gift.  He is a vivid realist, describing the sensory and psychological realities of everyday life.  He writes without irony--at least any that can be discerned.  Thus he can make the reader believe, stay attentive and tuned in.  Comparable to Salvador Dali, whose command of 19th century realist devices enabled him to paint convincing melted watches, flaming giraffes and floating crucifixions, Murakami's realism can make the most unlikely events vivid and palpable.  However, the multiple surreal and supernatural elements recall Stephen King--not a good association--in the way King could never seem to confine himself to one supernatural device when three or four could make the plot so much juicier.  And Murikami's elements, like King's, are often unrelated, seemingly trotted in without rhyme or reason.  There is no attempt to define a coherent world beyond the physical one, no supernatural cosmology;  we are given only various hints that reality is porous, and that physical laws can be interrupted in various ways at various times, at the whim of the gods--or the author.   These supernatural events don't build toward any one revelatory or climactic event, however, but are strung together like a necklace.  This, I am inclined to argue, is Murakami's weakness.  But then I had the same trouble with Halldor Laxness' Under the Glacier, which for me seemed eventually to disintegrate--melt?--into a dreamscape.   Kafka, Beckett-even T.C. Boyle in Descent of Man--could build and sustain haunted  quasisurreal worlds.    <br /> <br />But I am not sure of this criticism, that these comparisons are fair. I would suggest that everyone who is an audience for serious literature take a dip into Murakami. A singularity in the Modernist tradition, he represents the non plus ultra in a certain direction.  As with Proust, Joyce, Gertrude Stein, etc. and more recently Handke and Sorrentino, reading him thus allows one to test one's assumptions about reality, literary limits, narrative expectations, emotional involvement, the human willingness to be enthralled by an obvious travesty.   Wallace Stevens once made a statement:   <br /> <br />The final belief is to believe in a fiction, which you know to be <br /> a fiction, there being nothing else.  The exquisite truth is to <br /> know that it is a fiction and that you believe it willingly. <br /> <br />Murakami takes us to that level of self-conscious complicity. He succeeds in giving us the sensation that we are creating the story with him.  By its very meandering, seemingly unfettered outlandishness, his story keeps us self-conscious about our suspension of disbelief, and thus of our active participation in the \\"fiction.\\"  In my experience no one has done that to this extent.   So I can say to the worldly reader:  read Murakami;  you may discover something new about yourself, the mind, the imagination and maybe the possibilities of literature.   And have an enjoyable ride, perhaps, in the process.    <br /> <br />Murakami knows well what he's about, and he shares it with us.  He plants clues.The name \\"Kafka\\" is one.  More to the point, early on the 15-year-old Kafka Tamura himself reads The Thousand and One Nights.  Sheherazade's gift was to keep her auditor enthralled and expectant above all, and this is the author's forte. This book, like Chronicle, is outrageous, self-indulgent, whimsical, highly disciplined and tightly organized.  It has the intense, insistent authority of optimal writing.  Great literature or eccentric entertainment, I couldn't put it down.
B00092ZMDY|3.0|O.K. I'm passed through the title sequence...I love the Eagles, or else I wouldn't be writing. Joe & Don Felder had a deep respect & great love for each other for all these years.  Beyond the spoken word on the extras - there's a giant hole in the sprit of this cd!! All you need to do is review old highlights of Walsh & Felder jamming together in the old days.  It's none of my business - Felder may be in the wrong ( but I doubt it!) but this cd lacks the spirit of those classic Walsh/Felder moments! Of course Joe won't say anything (contractual, along with his sobriety!) but come on!!!  <br />Stuart (sp?) and Joe had all the chemistry of Alka Seltzer dropped in the tummy after Italian food - effective but uninspired to the bitter end!! Sigh........
B00097A5I6|5.0|i love this cd and its one of my fav oasis albums up to date. Every song on the album is top notch. My personal favorites are turn up the sun, lyla ,  Part Of The Queue and love like a bomb but every track is amazing like I said. Its the best new album Ive heard in awhile.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|Yep folks, copy protection!  This means if you want to transfer your music from the CD onto your ipod, or copy the music to your computer , you have to agree to a TOS, and install big brother's software.<br /><br />If you are satisfied with poor quality 128kbps m4ps from itunes, then go ahead and give in and shell out your ten bucks and download it.  Or, have a backbone and don't support Foo's decision to use this narrow minded mentality. Foo Fighters no better than Metallica? You make the call.
B00092ZMDY|4.0|I, along with all the other ravers on here have been a huge Eagles fan from the start.  I was also fortunate enough to have seen them 3 times in the 70's; (I was just a wee lad then, I swear).  The Eagles have been criticized for their practice of making every effort that live shows should be a close if not exact rendition of the recorded version. <br /> <br />I for one have always felt that was one of the reasons the band was so great; the show was about the songs, and the songs stood alone without excessive theatrics. <br /> <br />Here, the Eagles once again provide faithful renditions of many of their best band and solo material. <br /> <br />And, in mostly fine voice.  Yes, they look older, (cripes, Henley is almost 60) but these guys compared to the Stones or Aerosmith on looks alone are like poster boys for plastic surgery.  Except for Walsh, ah,the evils of drink.. <br /> <br />As far as sound, (which is AMAZINGLY rich and full) the singing is actually better than Hell Freezes Over.  Oddly enough, Walsh's singing is stronger (compare HFO's version of In the City) while Frey's is somewhat weaker and a bit brittle at the beginning.   <br /> <br />Yes Felder is gone, but his replacement is a true guitar session type gunslinger - every note faithfully done.  He just looks kinda geeky, but Felder did not add that much (sorry, my opinion) outside of his excellent playing.  He certainly wrote nothing of note, outside the guitar parts of Hotel California.  Ok, maybe he did add something.  But close your eyes, and the guitar sound is the same.   <br /> <br />More of a loss, in my opinion, is Randy Meisner, who Timothy B. Schmit replaced on bass and high vocals.  Nothing against Schmit, who is excellent, but Meisner's voice was irreplaceable. <br /> <br />Okay, History lesson over, this DVD is a fantastic value and perfectly done.  The photography is great, the sound fantastic, the new arrangement touches are a plus, (notable exception, Walk Away now has the back rhythm of In the City). Trivia note: the fiddle/sax player Al Garth was a member of Loggins and Messina.  <br /> <br />Henley still doesn't have a noticeable sense of humor, but Schmit's enthusiasm and Walsh's showmanship make up for it. <br /> <br />This guys look like they're (mostly) having a blast, and that alone is worth seeing..
B0009HLDFU|1.0|For any of us who still buy CDs of artists we love, this new copy protection of \\"CDs\\" is a total rip-off.  The first thing I do when I buy a new CD is rip it to my computer, not to share it with others, but to listen to it myself.  I only listen to music on my computer, and therefore, it only makes sense to have mp3 copies of it.  This CD doesn't even give you that option, and therefore, I can't give it anything but 1 star, even though the CD itself is good musically.  Shame on the Foo Fighters and BMG for performing this injustice on their loyal fans/customers.
B00005JNJT|5.0|I am totally blown away!  I recently saw this at my local drive-in and was completely astounded at the look and feel of this movie.  Unlike its counterparts this Batman film is a good deal edgier and a lot more gritty.  Instead of the flashy suits and fancy costumes and gadgets this film focuses more on the man behind the mask and how he came to be.  It reminds the audience again that unlike all the other superheroes to come to the screen, Batman has no special powers he is just an ordinary man behind the mask.  This is shown in the beginning, as the first part of the film focuses on how Bruce Wayne became what we now know as Batman.  It is quite interesting seeing everything that we've come to know as part of pop-culture come to life and see how it all evolved including the batcave and the famous symbol etched in the night sky.  The style of the film only amplifies the mood and makes all the other movies pale in comparison, this is how a good blockbuster should be made.  The acting is quite good as well, with Christian Bale fillling in the shoes that were so previously occupied by George Clooney and Michael Keaton.  Michael Caine gives a great performance as Alfred as well.  Katie Holmes plays a strong-willed DA who is the main squeeze for Bruce, sadly though there is not much too her character or her acting.  But overall the film was fantastic and I highly reccomend it to those who felt that the previous Batman films were a little too flashy for such a dark character.
B0007XT87G|5.0|Red Alert!! <br />I am a huge fan of Spock's Beard, Yes, Genesis, Supertramp, Flower Kings, etc  I saw PT last Monday in San Diego (6/13/05) at The House of Blues, for the very 1st time, and I was totally floored by the talent and presentaion of this band. They are THE BAND in my world right now!!  I bought DEADWING & IN ABSENTIA 3 weeks ago and I can barely think straight at work these days!! (...O.K. I'm a full time musician!) <br />If you love music for music's sake (!!!) then drop everything and go buy these albums and see them before you can't!! <br />This band is why I dropped everything years ago, and became a full time musician....Chills up the spine, \\"chicken skin\\", adventurous jamming, world class chops, A LAW UNTO THEMSELVES!!! Pink Floyd meets Dream Theatre, who meets Genesis, who meets, The Carpenters (?!)  They defy description but are deserving of everything the world of hard core music fans can heep upon them!!!
B0009353IW|5.0|Ever since Chicken Skin Music -ironically, another beauty honoring the Mexican influence on American music- Cooder has been one of the \\"saints of my devotion,\\" as my father used to say. In Chavez Ravine, an album he's been working on for about three years, Cooder researched the disappearance of an area of Los Angeles, and long-standing Mexican community, that was erased to make way for what would become Dodgers Stadium.<br />The album that has resulted from his interest is, then, a political statement about the legacy of Joe McCarthy, an elegy about old neighborhoods paved over by a twisted sense of progress, and an amazing group of songs showing the deep gift of Mexican-American music.<br />With the same cool touch and deep affection that Cooder already demonstrated for Malian music (Talkin' Timbuktu) and Cuban grooves (Mambo Sinuendo and Buena Vista Social Club), Ry gathered a host of incredible Mexican-American musicians from the Fifties, to invoke the spirit of this story.<br />Ersi Arbizu, Lalo Guerrero, Don Tosti and Little Willie G. -all great performers, most of which may be unknowns to most of us- take turns singing songs that conjure up the longings, loves and betrayals from the Chavez Ravine odyssey.<br />Now, let's be clear, do not think this is ethnographic research for the Smithsonian archives or a dry document of music gone by.<br />This album grooves (\\"Poor Man's Shangri-La\\" or \\"Onda Callejera\\") and gets down (\\"Muy Fifi\\" and \\"3 Cool Cats\\") as well as it will move you with some slow burners (\\"It's Just Work For Me\\") and beautiful ballads (\\"In My Town,\\" \\"3rd Base, Dodgers Stadium\\" and \\"Soy Luz Y Sombra\\").<br />In conclusion, this is some of the most soulful music you may come across this year. It proves, too, that you can move your body with abandon and reflect on serious issues at once.<br />Meaning and grooving, with passion and concern, master Cooder takes us for another ride through the real America, where great and forgotten voices get to sing aloud again.

6305280762|5.0|The tension social state in USA in those ages was practically reaching the boiling point. There were many conflicts issues and counter faced items. The collective self esteem was extremely low: evasion, scandals, affairs. When that happens you need to recreate another vision in the movies and many times you must apply the same process suffered by Alexander in the Clockwise Orange; this shock therapy may provoke a natural escape in the social body.<br /><br />That's why this Wave of catastrophes in the screen gave so very good profits. Somehow Airport  was the pivot and the different maneuvers were perfectly articulated: Poseidon Adventure, a terrible sea accident, and then a natural phenomena: Earthquake, but something missed to complete the cycle. A tragedy based in the violation of norms of Industrial Security, with the subsequent homage to the Firemen, trying to warn about the possible effects derived from risky actions to minimize operational costs.<br /><br />The rest of the story follows the ancient patterns of this genre: the abnegate fireman, the modern hero who will lose his life, a love affair, a sinister character, a couple in trouble who eventually will rejoin and all the well known premises that you may guess.<br /><br />Admirable from all standpoint with impressive special effects to that age; I insist in that point due the technology has experimented such advance level that the new generations will establish the respective differences with let's say Titanic. But it's good to advert that this young generation, in 2020 will suffer the same smile of that generation. Many people tend to forget, the life is simple cycle.<br /><br />Steve Mac Queen and Faye Dunaway shone above the rest of the cast. Dazzling direction.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000002KFJ|5.0|While \\"Paranoid\\" is probably Sabbaths most wellknown and most appreciated piece of work (a classic), I believe that \\"Sabotage\\" is my favorite Sabbath album. This isnt to say that \\"Paranoid\\" isn't a metal classic, a ground breaker. However, there's something about \\"Sabotage\\" that really gets my blood rolling. Ozzy is obviously crazy, and it really comes through on this album. The lyrics are totally nihilistic, self loathing and narsicistic. In other words, its genius. Ozzy, for those who dont know this yet, is NOT the best singer. He's not even pretty good singer. He's often off key and out of sync with the music, but its the WAY he delivers his \\"sermons\\" that make him so damn good. So LISTENABLE. Its almost as if he's making STATEMENTS, not singing. The music, as on ALL Sabbath albums, is pounding, deep and unrelenting. These guys were really the predescessors of all metal....speed metal and death metal that we hear today. Although most metal bands play louder and faster than Sabbath, nobody plays BETTER. All songs on here are good, with my favorite being \\"Dont Start (too Late)\\", \\"Megalomania\\" and \\"Hole in the Sky.\\" This album is a must have.
B000059QYB|5.0|This is an awsome Billy Idol cd. With Billy and, Stevens they make really great tracks. This is one awsome cd.

Its cheap and well worth your money. Man its so awsome I expected to pay more for it. So Order this album today, and you won't regret it.
006072448X|5.0|All too rarely is a book prize winner worthy of the prestige the award bestows upon it. If that's what you're thinking, believe me, you won't be feeling the same way about the new Orange Prize winner after you've read it. Lionel Shriver's \\"We Need To Talk About Kevin\\" is truly rivetting, a totally engrossing read and an outstanding novel that handles its difficult subject with such a searing degree of honesty and with such a clarity of vision and perception you don't have to be a mother to realise that ultimately parenting isn't a science, not even an art and that the influence one has in the shaping of the personality of one's offspring isn't as dominant a factor as one would like to think. Narrated through a series of unanswered letters to her estranged husband, Franklin, in the aftermath of their son Kevin's slaughter-fest, Eva leaves no stone unturned as she unearths and examines every bit of detail of her relationship with Kevin from the time of his birth to the present in order to understand her own failings as a mother, her own culpability. Funny, isn't it, how all mothers think they are the baker and their children their bread ? That Shriver should allow Eva to draw a blank after her exhaustive and harrowing introspection isn't surprising or cheating for having let off Eva lightly. It's only telling it like it is. Only Eva knows deep down inside she cannot take responsibility for the way Kevin turned out. Look at how he repaid his father's sensitive nurturing. Kevin's the changeling child from hell, the devil incarnate from \\"The Omen\\" but that's Eva's secret her naive husband refuses to share in.     Kevin may be the devil incarnate but what drove him to the rampage ? Now here's rub. Kevin understood the society that spawned him. He knew where and how he could get his two minutes of fame and watch his mother turn overnight into a second liner celebrity icon (after him, of course) and being skewered for his crime and \\"bringing him up wrong\\". That, for Kevin,would be like scoring a double victory, having his cake and eating it. Shriver's indictment of American society, one that has come to take everything that's good and right for granted when they remain hopelessly out of reach for many people elsewhere in the world, and one that expresses uncomprehending outrage when it's snatched away (albeit momentarily) from them, is a timely caution against complacency and self satisfaction. In other words, you don't want to end up like Franklin in the story.    \\"We Need To Talk About Kevin\\" digs real deep and hits a couple of painful spots if you're a parent. Though emotionally harrowing, the close and clammy truths the novel reveals and Shriver's razor sharp no holds barred prose makes it an utterly rewarding and resonant read. One of the very best this year. A brilliant novel you shouldn't miss !

B00006CXSS|5.0|Simply the BEST \\"television\\" show ever produced. No questions. This is flawless, a real masterpiece. Thank you Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg for bringing \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" to our television sets. Actually, I believe this should have been a movie. I dont care how long it would have run, people would have sat through it. But with todays televisions and surround sound systems, ones home theater if often just as impressive as the local mega-cinema.     Anyway.....on to the review. I cannot stress enough how well done this show is. With interviews with the REAL men featured in this epic, it really gives the viewer a sense that they're watching a moving, bleeding, crying, biography. What these men went through!!! The series begins in the U.S. military boot camp, where recruits are preparing, both mentally and physically, for the rigors of combat (if one can actually PREPARE for such a thing). Although the first couple of episodes are a little slow at times, they are important to understand the cohesion of the military units and how this cohesion was obtained. But once D-Day arrives......the action REALLY heats up.     Being dropped over Normandy on the night before D-Day so they can take important bridges and roadways from the Germans, as well as knocking out big artillary guns that can reign hot metallic death upon the troops landing on the Normandy beaches from MILES away, the boys (and they are just boys) of the 101st Airborne, Easy Company are loaded into gliders and troop transport aircraft for what they were TOLD would be an easy parachute drop into occupied France.     As soon as these terrified, shivering, airsick men cross the coast onto coastal Normandy.....all hell breaks loose. Antiaircraft fire literally paints the sky from one end of the horizon to the other. Many planes are blown out of the sky and drop, in flames, to a fiery death below. Others are shredded by shrapnel, tearing apart the young men who are experiencing the horror of combat for the first time, sending them tumbling to the ground below. The pilots panic, they know they're gonna get killed if the dont get out of there ASAP, so they unload their cargo and,in 99% of the cases, they were WELL short of their planned landing sites.     Easy Company bails out, hot shrapnel exploding in the air around them, the smell of cordite and gun powder burning their nostrils and seeping into their clothes. They're breathing hard, often hyperventilating. Their eyes are huge with fright. Some wet their pants. Some are shot to pieces by German ground troops as they float lazily through the hell that's surrounding them.     When they land, they are lost. Lost in a foreign country where almost everyone they encounter is going to try to kill them. And they dont speak the language. They ditch their parachutes and head out in an attempt to hook up with their buddies.......with ANYONE who looks familiar, any American will do. Little by little they begin to find other Americans. One or two here, another couple of guys there. The men they're running into (sometimes literally) are often from other divisions, but who cares, they're still friendly faces.    They begin to form little units and attempt to find their way to a meeting point or to where they were SUPPOSED to be originally. Often times, they encounter German soldiers. They hide in mud and flooded fields, they duck behind trees and hide in farm houses. Some are killed. They're as quiet as they can be. Their breath coming in short, frightened bursts. These ragtag groups of \\"brothers\\" band together and set out to do what they were THERE to do.     By morning, many of the stragglers had met up at a local Norman town, waiting for their buddies and for their commanders, many of whom NEVER arrive. \\"Band of Brothers\\" is a war story, but first and foremost, its a story of friendship, dedication and commmitment.     The series follows Easy Company from this horrific landing, through Operation Market Garden in Holland to the Battle of the Bulge and finally, to V-E day. Its a fabulous story, filmed in the same fashion as \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" giving the viewer the feeling that they are actually THERE with the troops, ducking as the bullets scream by, the shells explode, the blood runs and the men cry. The camera men run along with the actors. Everything is filmed from the same level as the troops. As they run, the camera moves up and down, when shells explode, the camera shakes and quivers. It's really the most realistic way to film war. Anyone who's seen \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" knows exactly what I'm talking about. And the sound effects are equally as wonderful. Bullets actually whiz by overhead, ping off metal and rip into trees around you. Often you can see the trail of the bullets as they tear by at murderously close range. You'd jump into a bush and hide, cover your head from the branches falling around you if you could.     It's extremely graphic, but its war. When someone is shot, its horrifying. They dont pause in mid step, grab their stomach, wince and fall to the ground. Their flesh is torn to pieces, bone blown out of the body, organs fall out. Blood pours freely and paints a ghastly picture on anyone in range of the spray. They scream in pain, they scream for their mothers. They die. Their buddies sob, they hold onto their bleeding, dying, disemboweled, friends and loose their minds. War is NOT pretty.  Anyone who votes eagerly to go to war has never BEEN to war.     At the end of this epic, I was in tears. What these innocent young boys were thrown into was enough to break even the hardest soul. But they did their job (proudly!!!!!) and some of them returned home. MANY didnt. This movie, as well as \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" should be mandatory viewing for all American High School students. Maybe then our future leaders wouldn't be so fast to vote for war.  The actors do a wonderful job. Many faces I had seen in other movies or television shows, many I had never seen before. Nobody super famous, but it's better that way, it's the WAR that's famous here and that gets all the attention. The emotion that these actors show was amazing, its almost (and this is gonna sound super corny) like they channeled the spirits of these fine young soldiers, portraying them with the zeal, determination and pride that they deserve.     I recommend this movie to anyone. Its reality brought to the big screen. Watch it (preferably in surround sound....loud). And next time you see an old man wearing a basball hat with his batallions insignia on it, remembering something that he experienced 60 years ago, THANK HIM, for what he sacrified for you (yes YOU) is astounding. And remember those who didnt return from this war, for what THEY sacrificed........was everything.
B0000TB050|5.0|This DVD is in my top 3 favorites out of a collection of over 40 concert DVD's.  The video is not as sharp as it could be, but I'll take that in exchange for such a good setlist, being 16:9, and and having a DTS track to choose (always pick it as it uses less compression than Dolby and just plain sounds better).  One thing that has always stood out to me with U2 concerts is the order of their setlists is always great, as they create a perfect ebb and flow of intensity and mood that makes songs that you like \\"OK\\" sound like awesome songs.  Bono is also quite the showman as opposed to being just a good singer, and it shows here.  This show is filled with emotion as his father had just passed away and the song Kite is dedicated to him.  There are a few songs like With or Without You that he seems like he's giving his voice a rest as he pratically speaks the lyrics, but that's the exception, not the rule.  The highlight for me was One, a song they often leave off the setlist.  If you are a rock fan, this needs to be in your collection as it a great performance of great material.  Can't wait to see them in November as I was lucky enough to score some tix.  Haven't seen them live since '93.
B000005DQR|5.0|So much has been said about this album and about DJ Shadow. Let me try to play Shadow and sample some of the reviews for you. You'll see certain comparisons pop up again and again: The Dust Brothers produced Beastie Boys' album Paul's Boutique, Tricky's Maxinquaye, Aphex Twin. The quality of the comparisons should indicate to you that this is a special album. It has the same versatility with samples that Paul's Boutique does, though they are generally less recognizable than those on Paul's Boutique. It's got the dark and insistent and trippy qualities of Maxiquaye. And it has the deep weirdness of Aphex Twin's work, particularly, for my money, Selected Ambient Works Volume 1. Of course, it is also different than each of those albums--lacking vocals for the most part and much more musically lush and dense than the sparse and etheral Selected Ambient Works Volume 1. The drums, Shadow's trademark, are greatly dominant here.<br /><br />This album stands as one of the best of the 1990s, among such electronica classics as the aforementioned Maxinquaye, Massive Attack's Blue Lines, and Leftfield's Leftism. As a reviewer of the deluxe edition put it: \\"it is truly the first musically post-modern piece of music in the recording art industry.\\" Some people will be too sophisticated for this album or on the other end incapable of appreciating it. If you're reading this with a mind towards purchasing this album, you're not one of them. It will blow your mind, I assure you.<br /><br />As late great British DJ John Peel said in his intro to the Diminishing Returns import, \\"you may find this hard to believe but you stand poised on the brink of hearing the mix of the year, fronted by command much given to frank and furious and usually accurate condemnation of the awful beings that inhabit the world of popular music--DJ Shadow--the celebrated San Franciscan weirdo.\\" You stand poised on the brink of hearing a great album.
B000B5XOXY|4.0|Schumacher's first attempt at Batman movie has mixed results, but mostly favorable. While probing Batman's psyche more than the first two, it does so slowly. At times dark, then bright, it has no clear direction and both villains, Two Face (Tommy Lee Jones) and the Riddler (Jim Carrey) are over played (a continuing problem in this series). Schumacher, however, does bring more capability at developing the fight scenes and suspense that was missing from Batman Returns. Kidman is a good Chase Merriden and her and Kilmer's chemistry works. Kilmer, however, lacks the intensity brought to the role by Keaton in the previous Batman movies. O'Donnell is poorly cast as Robin. Eliot Godenthal's core compliments this film and all in all, the entire movie provides enough frills to be enjoyable.<br /><br />This movie should have scaled down the villains to just one and played more seriously (this does not mean, one cannot have fun with the role). Two-Face's henchmen look stupid and where are they at the end, did they all loose to Batman in the water? Drew Berrymore is a bright spot in this film and the noir look is great.<br /><br />The extras are again great.  Schumacher's first Batman is good and I very much enjoyed it when it was released.  This set of Batman special editions are well produced and the Batman themes and interviews with the stars, producers, directors, and actors, as well as anyone I missed, is one the best special editions ever released, maybe only surpassed by the Lord of the Rings special editions.  The first three movies of this set are a five star rating as special sets go, but Forever, while surpassing Returns as amovie, does not match Burton's first Batman.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|A pretty good album, with some fun rockin' songs, but they had to go and add a cell phone ringing throughout the song \\"No Way Back\\". It distracts from the song. <br /> <br />They are using it as an attention getter. People come to attention when they here a cell phone ring, so they incorporated into the song, but it wrecks the song for me.
B0008ISM40|3.0|I waited eagerly for this to come out, and I have to say that it's probably the worst album NIN has put out. The Downward Spiral was brilliant... a masterpiece. Broken and Pretty Hate Machine were both great as well. The music started to deterioriate with The Fragile, which was a confused and bloated work.  It had really no idea where it was going, and was crammed full of so many b-side worthy songs that it became almost impossible to absorb. The lyrics became more shallow and rhymey and less about actually expressing anything. Of course the hardcore fans herald it as a triumph of some kind, but I felt that it was pretty unspectacular. Still, it was better than this.<br /><br />I wanted to give this 2 and a half stars, but since you can't do that, I guess I'll settle for 3... I would have given The Fragile 3 stars, and it should be noted that it's better, if not much.<br /><br />With Teeth drops the layered electronic soundscapes that defined the sound of Nine Inch Nails and replaces it with something more akin to riff rock. You have to listen really close to even hear any synths on most of the songs...<br /><br />The song Getting Smaller is a blatant rip off of The Pixies' hit single Planet of Sound. Seriously, do a side by side test - it's embarrasing. Rather sad actually...<br /><br />The first single, The Hand That Feeds, is terribly generic radio rock with hardly anything interesting going for it. The chorus is flaccid and underwhelming, and the verse has an unfortunate resemblence to a certain Kink's song. And the way he sings the ending, oh man... It sounds like Trent Reznor is trying to do the vocals for a jazzy lounge musical. And that crap synth solo at the end doesn't exactly make me juiced. The song gets tired before it finishes. Without a doubt the worst single NIN's put out.<br /><br />You Know What You Are features a chorus that absolutely fails. It tries so hard to 'rock' that it just sounds kind of sad and pathetic. There's no authenticity in it, no real emotion, just the title of the song sung over and over again with an explitive thrown in. Guess which one...<br /><br />Speaking of which, singing the title of the song over and over again is the norm for this album. It's the method employed for All the Love in the World, You Know What You Are, Everyday Is Exactly the Same. It gets tired pretty quick.<br /><br />Love is Not Enough has some of the worst lyrics NIN has ever put out. \\"HEY! The sooner we realize! We cover ourselves in lies! But underneath we're not so tough! Oh love is not enough!\\" Come on, you can do better than that. The song is also awkward and struggling to reach some kind of cohesive structure, much like The Collector.<br /><br />Many of the choruses to the songs jump in awkwardly, almost as though they were forced into the song. It doesn't help that most of the lyrics are truly juvenile, and seem to be entirely focused around Trent Reznor's assesment of his own relevence in the current music scene. I find it somewhat hard to relate with Reznor's personal evalutions of his influence. It comes accross as a concept album about his inflated ego. The lyrical reference to \\"fading away\\" grows tiresome after the first thousand instances, and by the time you get to the end of Getting Smaller (where he just chants over and over again \\"fade away!\\") you really could do without hearing the word ever again. It's just narscisistic and trite.<br /><br />That isn't to say that there aren't some good moments on the album. Beside You In Time is a really good song that builds in a gradual and effective way, even if it did promise to be much better from the teaser trailer that was offered on the NIN website. It grows on you though. Sunspots has a really good dynamic to it, and it's a welcome break from the tired verse-chorus-verse-chorus structure of the songs.<br /><br /> Only is a very bizarre song, and it has a fun sense of humor to it. Some of the synth tones on it may sound pretty dated, and the drums may not do too much, but it's still a good straightfoward NIN song that recalls the better moments on Pretty Hate Machine. It also has some of the best lyrics on the album. I'm particularly into the lyric \\"I just made you up to hurt myself.\\"<br /><br />That's some good stuff. Overall though, it's just not that remarkable. The one really standout track is Right Where It Belongs, which is a great track that belongs up there with the best stuff NIN's put out. All the fans will get it anyway, but if I'm reccomending something here, I guess I'm talking to people who aren't hardcore fans,.... and I'm begging you to please buy The Downward Spiral or Broken or Pretty Hate Machine or Still or The Fragile or Further Down the Spiral or Fixed before you pick this up.tfoward NIN song that recalls the better moments on Pretty Hate Machine.

B00005JNEI|4.0|I thought this was a very good film.  It gets people thinking and talking, which is exactly its point. <br /> <br />The problem I have with the DVD are those little Moore-isms.  As others wrote, who is Michael trying to kid?  His reputation is fairly well known, especially after TV Nation.  But the nonsense in there about this film receiving an R rating?  Bowling for Columbine was R, but Moore wasn't outraged at that (probably because he got an Oscar for that one).  If he really wants his film to hit a younger audience, then he should offer an alternate version of this film.  They made a school PG version of SuperSize Me, so why not this film?  Michael needs to drop some of his old tactics and let the films speak for themselves, because this one certainly does.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I like to write my reviews in spanish because it's easier for me and there are a lot of latins on this site.<br /><br />La primera vez que escuch&eacute; de Radiohead fu&eacute; con la canci&oacute;n Creep. Qued&eacute; bastante prendido de ella, pero en esos momentos estaba muy ocupado descubriendo a otras bandas. Pero unos a&ntilde;os despu&eacute;s, escuch&eacute; la c&eacute;lebre Paranoid Android y me encant&oacute; desde el primer momento. Adquir&iacute; el disco a los pocos d&iacute;as. Igual que otros reviews, hasta la tercera vez pude apreciar el disco en todo su esplendor. Ahora son mi banda favorita. Si lees esto y todavia no has escuchado el disco (cosa que dudo un poco), pruebalo, dale tiempo al disco; sus canciones son complicadas, dale toda tu atenci&oacute;n. Si al cabo de 5 escuchadas no te ha gustado, tal vez el disco no es para t&iacute;. Prueba con otro tipo de m&uacute;sica. Coldplay es una buena opci&oacute;n. Me encantaria que este disco alcanzara de nuevo las 5 estrellas. Se lo merece. No por nada es uno de los 10 mejores discos de la historia (ojo, que no el primero)
B0009IW88A|4.0|This soundtrack is not an enormous crowd pleaser like Elfmans soundtrack. Very much of this sounds eerie, introspective, atmospheric, horrific and mournful. I didn't warm to it immediately, but after the 3rd turn it's beginning to grow on me. Those expecting the frenetic bombast of the Elfman theme will be disappointed. There is no strong central theme here although there are themes. Instead this soundtrack weaves a world around you, like listening to Bruce Wayne thinking dark thoughts inside a bat cave. Like the eye of a hurricane, building himself up until...BAM!..by the 10th track he is fully in motion, this track sounds...relentless. Like a big flapping bat whose got his fangs in your neck and will not let go. <br /> <br />I admit, I like the Elfman soundtrack for different reasons, simply because it's got better developed themes and it's much more fanciful/fantasy driven. But if you want to brood with Bruce inside his busted up psyche, it's worth a listen.
B00001U03Q|5.0|As the 1980's opened, Clapton seemed more tuned into the mainstream without sacrificing any of his vital bluesy guitar and his throaty vocals.  The Clapton Chronicles pick up where Cream of Clapton leaves off.<br /><br />The engaging radio-friendly \\"Forever Man\\" from the Phil Collins-produced Behind The Sun continued Clapton's run on the pop charts, with his signature wailing blues guitar in full form.  However, it turned out to be his last Top 40 hit for a while.  Also from that album was \\"She's Waiting\\" with its pounded out synths in the chorus. It ends interestingly with frenzied accompaniment by some female backing singers, snare drum and piccolo.<br /><br />\\"It's In The Way that You Use It,\\" from the Color of Money soundtrack and also on his August album, was the first solo song I heard from him thanks to MTV, still with the full sound of guitars, synths, saxes, and brass.  Other tracks from August not on here that I enjoyed were \\"Run,\\" the ballad \\"Holy Mother,\\" and his duet with Tina Turner, \\"Tearing Us Apart,\\" so 1986 wasn't a bad year for him.<br /><br />Next he released Journeyman (1989), which critics showed as a return to form, and even his best album since Slowhand, as seen with Bo Diddley's righteous \\"Before You Accuse Me,\\" which is simply marvelous pure blues, and where he gets help from Robert Cray.  This album was produced by Russ Titleman, who had revitalized Steve Winwood's career with Back In The High Life and Roll With It and indeed, \\"Pretending\\" could've fit on Roll With It.  Chaka Khan helps with backing vocals here, ironic as she did the same for Winwood's \\"Higher Love.\\"  \\"Bad Love\\" gets a boost from Phil Collins on drums and backing vocals.  There's less of the synths and more traditional rock instrumentation, which explains Journeyman's reputation as Clapton's best 80's album.<br /><br />Then came 20 March 1991, when his four-year old son Conor was killed in a fall.  Following an extended absence, he came out with the heart-wrenching \\"Tears of Heaven,\\" sung in a delicate falsetto, from the Rush soundtrack.  With \\"Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven\\" and the resolve of \\"I must be strong and carry on/'cause i know i don't belong here in heaven\\" the reference is more than clear. This gave him the first of two Grammies for Best Record.  The version here is the original studio version.<br /><br />From the Grammy-winning Unplugged, there is the considerably slowed down version of \\"Layla.\\"  Its tempo is indeed a reminder of its blues roots.  This peaked at #12, two positions below of its studio counterpart peak.  The live version of \\"Running On Faith\\" originally from Journeyman, is also included.<br /><br />His second Grammy came with the Babyface-produced \\"Change The World\\" from the Phenomenon soundtrack.  This Top Five ballad had a notably more romantic and theme, albeit mellowed, and with a more with a nice pop-soul backing vocal troupe.<br /><br />A handful of the songs here denote how much Clapton was sobered by his tragedy, reminded perhaps of mortality in general.  \\"Blue Eyes Blue\\" from the Runaway Bride soundtrack,  shows a more subdued Clapton:  \\"it was you who put the clouds around me/It was you who made the tears fall down.\\"  \\"River of Tears\\" with its funereal airy synths by Simon Climie of Climie Fisher fame who co-produced the album Pilgrim, of a man trying to start over after a split-up, and the #16 single \\"My Father's Eyes,\\" also from that album attest to that.  On hearing \\"how could I lose him?\\" and \\"Through the distant clouds of tears/I'm like a bridge that was washed away\\" there is a sign that Clapton was still mourning and pouring it into these songs.<br /><br />Where the 80's showed him holding steady, the 90s showed him winning more music recognition and glory, but at such a heavy price.  Small wonder he was drowning in a river of tears.\\"Tears of Heaven,\\" sung in a delicate falsetto, from the Rush soundtrack.

B0000E6XH3|5.0|Then this is it!!!  This is as good as it gets!!  As some people know, I am a Daft Punk fan as well, and I loved this little film.  I saw movie clips on Cartoon Network, and now I've finally got my hands on the DVD!!!<br /><br />Seeing where I left off of Cartoon Network--WOW!!  I didn't expect for it to come out as good as it did, and I'm glad there was no talking (it reminded me of Disney's \\"Fantasia\\").  The story was fantastic, and of course the stellar music made the movie all the satisfying to watch (as well as sad).<br /><br />I hope that if Daft Punk does a project like this again, their best bet is to team up with Leiji Matsumoto!
B00003CXBK|5.0|Man! Out of all of Miyazaki's animes, this is the best. And to all of you who didn't like it, I don't blame you. To me, yhe movie is even better than Star Wars and I really like Star Wars. Miyazaki's films were great but there is something about Princess Mononoke. The movie has adventure, passion, violence and who could, of course, the love. The love between San and her loved one is just like in Spirited away. In Spirited Away, there's a character(Haku) and another one. Their loved ones get into trouble so she/he has to save them. Miyazaki's films go tward one direction. Love and heroic action. Princess mononoke and Spirited away has both but, something about Princess Mononoke that is even better than Spirited Away. Princess Mononoke has the adventure all teens like me would like. The movie was in the library and I borrowed it over and over. If I could rate it from 1 to 10, I would give it a 9,000,000,000,000.
B0002858YS|4.0|The Killers are one of the new era of rock bands (Franz Ferdinand, Snow Patrol, Muse, Libertines, The Zutons) that are taking over the music industry by storm and replacing the all that crap Rap and Pop we have to listen to now. <br /> <br />When I first heard them I mistook them for a British band due to the leader singer having a strong British Accent. <br />As a strong Oasis fan I have to say, they are not as good as Oasis in their Hayday( Whats the story morning glory, time), but their showing signs of the same vigour and style of music that Oasis once had. <br /> <br />Overall I have to say the album's not bad. The first 5 songs are really good, but apart from \\"On Top\\" the others fail to impress. However I have to say that it is an Album worth buying, and I hope they keep producing music as good in the future and one day they might eclipse Oasis in the music industry (Highly Unlikely).
0671739662|5.0|I read this book in two days, just couldn't put it down. Once it takes off, which doesnt take long with Jeffery Archer, it REALLY takes off. I would like to compare it with the Bourne Identity movies, just action packed. A game of cat and mouse at its best. <br />A little about the author, Jeffery Archer was the youngest memeber of the House of Commons in 1969, apointed Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party 1985, Moved up to the House of Lords 1992. Bascially this guy was a big fish in the British Goverment. He wrote a couple of books, one of which \\"Not a Penny more, Not a Penny less\\" I think is magnificent and has about the same pace as this book. He was sent to prison in 2001 after a sex scandal which rocked...i want to say the world...but i can't be sure... <br />Anyway the book starts off with a Adam Scott recieving his Father's will which contains a mysterious envelope......KGB, CIA and SAS all want it. He doesnt find out until after he gets it, by then everybody in the world and their highly trained assasins are after him. Being British he tries to run to them, but for the sake of the plot, they keep screwing up and he is always one step ahead of the russian assasin who REALLY loves killing people. Plus to add wood to the fire, the cops want him for a muder he did not commit. <br />All this may sound over the top, but Archer weaves it superbly, making it unbelivably fast paced.  <br />The book being from a british author has a heap of british words, Trouser-Pants, Phoned-Called, Lift-Elevator and so forth. so it might be a little irritating if you do not know what he means, but honestly this little gripe doesn't in any way compare to the way the book is written.  <br />
B00003CXXJ|3.0|I never went to see this movie when it was in the theaters. It was the only movie that managed to stick around all summer long (in 2001), while others came in and went out like a flame on a match stick.<br /><br />I eventually ended up watching it a while later, and regretted the fact that I didn't see it in the movies.  Though the movie is great for all ages, the adults would find something that they like, as well as the kids.<br /><br />I'm not going to give away the movie, but I did like the story.  I'm glad that Fiona and Shrek got together, but at the same time, Lord Whatever (cannot spell his name if my life depended on it) shows us just how superficial we can be.  Heck, he didn't look all that good, either!<br /><br />If you're looking for a twist in a somewhat modern and hilarious fairy tale, Shrek is where you should start.
B000957O82|2.0|It must be the fact that Will Smith starred in this film because I can see no reason why Hitch was so successful.  It's not that funny, it's not that original, and it's not nearly as good as I would expect from Will Smith.  The only good thing I can say about this film is Kevin James was great.
0385336810|4.0|This is an entertaining book.  However, be aware of the foul language.  Someone should tell Sophie Kinsella, the author, that foul language is disappointing, not cute, not necessary to the plot, and still offensive to many people.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|Well, they have done it.  Dave Grohl admitted that the Foo Fighters last studio release, \\"One By One\\", was thrown together all too quickly.  He even admitted that it \\"sucked, except for about four songs.\\"  What those four songs were, who knows, but now, that is all distant history as nobody will remember failure with the release of \\"In Your Honor\\". <br /> <br />     The album(s), one electric, one acoustic, bring out \\"The Best\\" of the Foo Fighters, regardless of what pun a cheap pun that may be.  The only album of theirs that I feel is superior to this one is \\"The Colour and the Shape\\", the Foo Fighters 1997 release.  However, this album embodies all that is a great rock album (or in this case albums). <br /> <br />     Dave Grohl's songwriting ability definitely took strides with the making of this album.  He has always been an excellent songwriter, especially in the ballad area, but this time he explored a wider range of songwriting.  For instance, \\"Still\\" is a first hand account of a boy who committed suicide in Dave's hometown of Arlington when he grew up.  The song weaves it's way through the perspective of the boy and then interlopers after the incident.  In it, Dave explains how he and some friends found pieces of the deceased boy's skull and played games with it breifly, before they realized it was wrong. <br /> <br />     Another beauty is \\"Friend of a Friend\\", a song supposedly written about Kurt Cobain.  It is reminicsent of a Nirvana song, which is fitting.  Highlights are too hard to narrow down, as on the electric album, there is a constant sense of anticipation and a barrage of heavy rock flying through the speakers.  The already well known hit, \\"Best of You\\", will probably soon have some company on the radio and MTV video rotations, by its brothers \\"DOA\\", \\"Resolve\\", and I am predicting \\"The Deepest Blues Are Black\\" to end up as a single. <br /> <br />     I was actually not looking forward to the electric album, but to say the least, I was pleasantly surprised.  It far surpassed the standards of my expectations.  I knew the acoustic album would be exceptional,and I was right.  If \\"Virginia Moon\\", in which Grohl does a duet with the alluring Norah Jones, is not one of the most beautiful tracks ever recorded, I will eat my shorts.  The song \\"Cold Day In The Sun\\", in which drummer Taylor Hawkins leaves the thrown to throw his smokey voice through sharps and flats is excellent.  It is similar to any Grateful Dead song, in which the listener can bob his or her head from side to side continuously. <br /> <br />     There are a few flaws that I noticed.  For one, The idea of seperating the electric portion from the acoustic version detracts from the albums' beauty.  I think it would be better suited to do a combined double album for balance.  Secondly, Dave's screaming throughout the first album is not really what I appreciate from him, but he pulls it off, and I have to accept that this is his vision and what he wants to do.  I guess you can just tell that on all of the songs, singing or screaming, he is singing his heart out.  Lastly, the liner notes were vague.  I know they did this personally to be suttle, to match the theme of the album, but I enjoy reading nice and juicy band gossip and lyrics just as good as the next person. <br /> <br />     So I ask you, the reader, hopefully not a puppet, to go out, buy this album and listen to it and formulate your own opinion about it.  And please, for god's sake don't sit there and repeat #3 on CD 1 over and over again.  Enjoy the whole ablum, that is what it is there for.  If you are that shallow, just go buy the single.  This record is a classic.  Period.
B00092ZMDY|4.0|I walked into Best Buy today and saw this DVD on the shelf & I grabbed it immediately.  This concert is very enjoyable to watch and I love their joke title (Farewell 1 tour).  It's a nice, relaxed concert.  My only problem is that sometimes it's just a little too relaxed; some of the rocking songs are just a little too mellow.  But that's okay.  All-in-all, this DVD was great!
B00005J6UP|2.0|I had great memories of this as a kid.  As an adult, I was very disappointed in the awful language in this movie.  I don't want my kids watching this.  Also, one of the brothers taunts the other by calling him \\"adopted\\" (which he isn't).  It's just meant as an insult, which is a really terrible thing to be showing to children.  Adoption is a wonderful gift & blessing - and I definitely don't want my children seeing that kind of garbage (especially since we are adopting!!!!).  I got rid of the DVD after watching it once.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Between Burton (Tim), Bale (Christian), and Batman, the combination is unbeatable in this best yet melding of the Batman legacy.  Bale's depth of character is a little too superficial but I'm hoping that will develop in the next movie.  Otherwise, give me a Tim Burton movie any time an I know I'll be satisfied.  GO SEE THIS ONE.
B0006L16N8|5.0|After a 3-year absence, Coldplay has comeback with the sensational \\"X&Y.\\" The long wait is finally over and Coldplay doesn't disappoint. The music on the album is fantastic. They at least did better in that area. Chris Martin's voice sounds stronger. I think the songs are more interesting this time. There are several songs on here that will be considered classics a few years from now. The best album of 2005 so far.
B0009A1AS2|1.0|Dream Theater seemed to have put out this CD to meet a deadline because the material on \\"Octavarium\\" is substantially below par - in terms of songwriting, arrangements and freshness. <br /> <br />First, the songwriting...  After listening to the CD once I couldn't remember one single hook, melody or chorus - nothing stuck.  No \\"Wow\\" moments or thoughts of \\"I gotta hear that again!\\"  Each and every song, and I mean EVERY song, left me thinking, \\"They weren't trying too hard on that one.\\"  Lot's of rehashing & retreading of old riffs, rhythms and concepts, lyrically and musically.  It sounds as if the band are scraping the bottom of the idea barrel here.  Utterly uninteresting and uninspiring, unfortunately. <br /> <br />Arrangements are not as bad, but I expect more than a \\"typical\\" rock arrangement from DT - shifts in mood, texture, time signature and the unexpected.  But there is nothing unexpected here - I could tell where each song was headed after listening to the first minute and a half.  I had no sensation of being on a journey to somewhere I hadn't been before.  DT has always been good at that - this time they failed completely. <br /> <br />And that leaves me with the overall impression that \\"Octavarium\\" is %100 stale and DOA.  The material sounds like old throw aways <br />from previous albums that were lumped together to put out something.  There have been a lot of \\"conspriracy theories\\" from other negative reviews with accusations ranging from lack of interest from the band members (and being more interested in side projects) to laziness to just being plain outta gas.  Whichever it is, it is incredibly dissapointing.  I will now have to seriously question future releases by DT - no longer will I just throw down my cash because it's DT - they're going to have to re-earn my attention, (I haven't been in love with the previous two studio releases, but they are far and away better than this one). <br /> <br />For the vet DT fan, I urge strong caution - listento it first before you buy it.  They are not \\"Progressing\\" but rather \\"digressing.\\"  For the new fan, I would suggest anything other than this because \\"Octavarium\\" is in no way, shape or form a true representation of why DT have been so heralded in the world of prog rock/metal.
B0007JTUJQ|5.0|This delightful little book is a novelization form of the Beatles' first movie, 1964's \\"A Hard Day's Night.\\"  The book has 8 pages of photographs from the movie.<br /><br />Beatle fans and experts will laugh while catching certain lines that were assigned to one Beatle (in the book), but delivered by another Beatle in the movie.  At the time this book was written, the movie was still in progress and the script, while intact, was being tailored to the personality of each Beatle.  Still, it is a fun book and a good part of any fan's collection.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Well in 1999 DT came out with their best and maybe THE best album that was Scenes of a Memory. Best piece of musical art ever, had a story (very rare) and all songs ran in sync with one another. In this CD, it tries to capture that minus the story. All songs were nicely constructed and had good and intelligent lyrics.  <br />Good to see that the skills they aquired from side projects, like LTE, came up in this album. Finally. Fast riffs and nice piano works came up here.  <br /> <br />1)The Root of all Evil- A good opener to a DT cd. Long and very instramental. Finishes the \\"This Dying Soul\\" saga and does it nicely. 9/10 <br /> <br />2)The Answer Lies Within- Well im still looking for it. Personally i don't like this types of songs other than the ones in MP2. 4/10 <br /> <br />3)These Walls- Good song with good build up parts, but for some reason they oddly sound like the ones used in a The Used song. DT did it better though. 8/10 <br /> <br />4)I walk Beside you- If this song was in MP2:SFAM, no one would bitch cuz it would fit nicely. But for some reason the \\"pop likeness\\" Though its radio friendly, thats fine. Good lyrics and good song. 8/10 <br /> <br />5)Panic Attack- Best song, has all of DT's strong points in it. 10/10 <br /> <br />6)Never Enough- Was the first song i heard from Octavarium and is a good one. But is seems like an Post-Panic Attack song. But more of a good thing never hurts. 7/10 <br /> <br />7)Sacrificed Sons- A bit late in its concept but always a nice touch. Awsome guitar work and nice instamental with vocals. 7/10 <br /> <br />8)Octavarium- Haven't listened to this song as much as i wanted to becuase i have to commit 24 minutes for it. It is a nice song with alot of guitar work and shows the skills of Rudess from his latest solo work. Nice closer and I hope it closes the DT concert im going to in August. 8/10 <br /> <br />Alot of people cuss this CD becuase its different. But then again I thought Train of Thought was an amazing CD. I enjoyall DT works and own most of their cds. They never let me down.
B0007OCG56|4.0|While expecting a fluffy romantic comedy, I was pleasantly surprised to find many layers of substance and real life no-quick-fixes story-telling.  This full of heart film is about so much - dreams, expectations, sacrifice, and yes, love - even the honest conditional kind.  The acting was superb (and no, that is not Penolope Cruz!), especially by Leoni and Leachman.  The honesty and vulnerablity of the characters evokes the \\"laughter through tears\\" emotion. You'll see a little of yourself in some of the characters, which is why you find yourself cheering on even the misguided ones.
B00012QM8G|1.0|This movie has been acknowledged as the definitive movie made about the Holocaust, and in it all the Jews survive. This is really a slap in the face to the 6 million Jews who were slaughtered, their suviving families, and the 5 million other gypsies, Catholics, unionists, and others Hitler had killed in concentration camps. Spileberg made the movie this way because he knew it would be guaranteed commercial and critical success as it would be more palatable to the average person than a movie showing the real horrors of the Holocaust. He portrays the nazis as mostly men who act out of corruption, and meanness, but ignores the true fact that these men were evil. Liberals like Spielberg have a very difficult time acknowledging the fact that evil exists. They attribute the actions of evil people to feelings of necessity on their parts, or just to sheer lunacy. The Holocaust was an evil action perpetrated by evil men. It wasn't just thrown together. It was well thought out in terms of logistics, transportation, and means of killing and disposing of bodies. A classic Spielberg moment was when Schindler beseeches the Nazi guards to not kill the plant workers when the war has ended. \\"Return to your families as men, not murderers.\\" The fact is the Nazis did their best to liqudate the Jews when they knew they had lost the war and even up to the very end. The simple reason that more Jews weren't killed at the end is that the Nazis had ran out of ammunition to kill people en masse. This isn't meant to denigrate people like Schindler who really did good. The fact is though that most Germans were indifferent at best and helped the process along at worst. By highlighting Schindlers story Spielberg told the easy story and still came out smelling like roses. Meanwhile almost 12 million victims are ignored.
B0002O06N0|5.0|Being from Mississippi, I was a bit skeptical at a band like this, from Ohio of all places, supposedly playing some hardcore hill country style blues.  But, alas, my skepticism was for naught....these guys rock.  These guys sound like they are from some north Mississippi juke joint, on a drunken Saturday night.  If you like your music raw, ...real, hands dirty, feel the sweat, smell the smell of malt liqour in the air....then this is for you.  Great stuff....
B0002OERI0|5.0|so what if theyre corporate punks?? they still rock this is prolly the only political cd ive heard. anti flag should be more like green day.
B0008KLVG4|3.0|I'll keep it short & sweet.  JAWS is my favorite film of all time, so I had high hopes for the just-released \\"30th Anniversay\\" DVD edition - OK, now I officially feel very OLD, since I can recall being scared sh*tless back in the summer of 1975 seeing the movie with my hand over my 8-year-old eyes at a drive-in!  Still, I cannot hide my extreme disappointment that, even though it's nice to have the fascinating documentary is restored to its 2-hour entirety (I saw it on LD, and you're not missing much actually) AND the original sound mix, this \\"new and improved\\" (?) DVD edition fumbles on two huge items: WHERE ARE THE ORIGINAL THEATRICAL TRAILERS?  WHERE ARE THE ORIGINAL TV SPOTS I recall seeing as a kid all over TV in weeks up to the release? (JAWS as the FIRST studio movie to utilize a major TV buy to saturate the media to guarantee blockbuster box-office)?  Also, another fan pointed this out: WHY WHY WHY does Universal insist on RUINING the ORIGINAL classic ICONIC 70s one-sheet image by \\"re-designing\\" (ruining?) it with too-slick hologram cover art?  Bring back the REAL POSTER!  And it's just GREEDY and SHODDY to claim this is an upgraded \\"super edition\\" when they can't even bother to use state-of-the-art technology to clean up/restore the original print, now FADED and GRAINY in several spots.  This isn't any way to treat the BEST FILM OF ALL TIME!  And yes, a lack of ANY commentary (from either the CAST, CREW, DIRECTOR, or PRODUCERS) is a real shame - WHAT are they waiting for? Oh yeah, the...35TH ANNIVERSAY Edition - \\"JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT IT WAS SAFE TO BUY A DVD AT TARGET...\\"
B0000009RT|5.0|It's interesting to read these reviews (most of them from ardent fans some of whom have real insights) and remember the general public's reaction to Freak Out when it 1st appeared back in 66. From what I remember it was pretty much universally hated by everyone that heard it. Parents hated it (parents hated everything) the sports freaks hated it passionately or just didn't care... one friend told me he wouldn't play it on his record player (before the concept of expensive stereo superhetrodyne receiver/amplification modules) because it would make his speakers puke! If you played this at a high school party back in 1966 you'd almost certainly get beat up.    Of course it's natural to dislike someone who doesn't like you and Zappa's contempt for society generally (not excluding his buying public) was pretty obvious. Most of them are really kind of stupid and ugly too. Anyway lots of these people still shake their head in disbelief at the thought of anyone actually liking this sort of music. Lots of them are dead now too so they probably died being wrong about a lot of things besides Zappa.     Freak Out was the start of something entirely different if not yet absolutely free. The beginning of discontented music for the disenfranchised, courtesy of a musical malcontent... and it actually became popular and made him famous. God Bless America!!
B0006L16N8|2.0|When I first listened to AROCBTTH a few years ago I was drawn in to the music further after every listen. <br /> <br />With X&Y I did NOT experience the same magnetism.  The songs on X&Y are, except for a few, not remarkable.  The album is rhythmic but not for the most part melodic.   <br /> <br />After giving up on X&Y after listening to it 6 times in a row, I listened to AROCBTTH.  The sound of Coldplay in 2002 was their moment of brilliance which is now lost.
B000002AGE|5.0|This album is completely lacking all the mindless and self-indulgent/pointless solos that made contemporary jazz what it was in the late seventies... hit and miss! If you think all late seventies jazz is inconsistent at best and irritating at worst (like I did) then you should check this title out. It's tight and complex yet still melodic and a refreshing break from endless noodling and meandering solos that plague so many jazz albums. On Heavy Weather when a musician takes the focus he does it within the parameters of the tune rather than considering it his 45 seconds to go ape sh*t! Structure in music doesn't need to be boring.
B0000844IT|5.0|Before Sam Raimi brought SPIDER-MAN to the screen, he gave the world a wonderful horror movie: ARMY OF DARKNESS. One of my favourites for years, this is a cult classic favourite and still, in this humble critic's opinion, Raimi's best film. You can argue, but i've never seen anything like this before and probably never will again. Bruce Campbell is fantastic as the chainsaw-weilding hero and the effects and make-up are awesome. And to complement a great movie the DVD extras are impressive (considering the low-budget of the film's production). Extras include an insightful and informative commentary by director Sam Raimi and star Bruce, alternate endings and versions of the film, deleted scenes and more. A satisfying package and a must-have for horror buffs.
B000003TA4|3.0|Don't get me wrong, Nirvana were talented. Even an assclown like some of the reviewers below who gave this 1-star are kidding themselves. Whether they were \\"corporate\\" or \\"hypocritcal\\" means nothing to me, I listen for the music. There are some really great songs here that stand the test of time, but my beef is this. Nirvana is way overrated. The only other bands I can think of that are this overrated are Pearl Jam and Soundgarden, oh..and every other band from the grunge-movement of the early 90's. These bands all combined made like one LP's worth of good songs that stand the test of time...that's it. It's a shame when slightly above-average rock bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam get so much glory when the true indie/alt rock of the era like Dinosaur Jr. and Pavement who made REALLY great music that needs to be heard.
B00003CXCT|5.0|With REVENGE OF THE SITH in cinemas, the final chapter in the SW saga has been widely recognized as the best of the prequels, but still lacks the special touch that these 3 classic films have. George Lucas' THX-1138 was cool, American Graffiti showed real talent and Star Wars: A New Hope is generally regarded as the greatest movie ever made. Why? Well, what's not to like? From the opening shot of the Blockade Runner accompanied by that great theme tune by John Williams, you know you're in the unique world of the STAR WARS universe. Before George's lackluster prequels THE PHANTOM MENACE and ATTACK OF THE CLONES, A NEW HOPE was known only as STAR WARS. Audiences had never seen anything so original and amazing. Now, the series has entered into the fanboy culture all over the world. In comparison, Episode 4 seems somewhat tame compared to Revenge of the Sith in terms of action, but it's still superior in terms of story and acting talent. And now that ROTS has finished the saga, it has to be said that these 3 films, despite being made 20 or so years ago, they still stand up today and the new generation of kids love these movies.<br /><br />From Hero Luke Skywalker's symbolic journey from his home Tatooine to the moment of victory at the finale, we are greeted with a myriad of fantastic characters, especially Han Solo, played by a pre-Indy Harrison Ford and his buddy Chewbacca. And the ultimate incarnation of evil, Darth Vader. And that, more than anything, is what made TPM so hollow. While the action was impressive in parts, the lack of good characters is disappointing. But ROTS has regained much of the sense of adventure that this film started off.<br /><br />Lucas' grand vision illuminates the entire film, with inventive creatures and events. Several scenes that are my favorites are Obi Wan's conversation to Luke about the Clone Wars and Vader, Solo's disposal of Greedo, Obi Wan and Vader's last confrontation and the battle of Yavin. One of my all-time favorite films, STAR WARS is THE great adventure.<br /><br />Directed by Irvin Kershner, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK moved away from the high-spirited antics of the first film and took a step towards the dark side. The Empire is preparing to seek revenge on the Rebel Alliance, C3P0 gets blasted to bits and Luke Skywalker finds out that Darth Vader is his dad! Even John William's score is much darker in tone than his previous efforts. But the film is an excellent adventure that many fans consider to be superior to the original. Mark Hamill returns as Luke, Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia and Harrison Ford as the sardonic Han Solo. And we are introduced to the wise Yoda, who trains Luke about the ways of a Jedi. The action ante is upped considerably, with fantastic chases through asteroid fields, battles between snow speeders and the AT-ATs and Luke's rescue mission. And the Bespin Duel, where the confrontational battle between Vader and Luke ends with one of the most shocking revelations in movie history (Even if it's somewhat un-surprising for future fans who watch all the completed films in sequence).<br /><br />The weakest of the 3, RETURN OF THE JEDI starts off with Luke and Leia rescuing Han Solo from the crime lord Jabba the Hutt. While the film is less exciting than it's counterparts, it does have some good action, including the rescue on the desert skiff, the speeder chase through the forest of Endor, the dark final battle between Darth Vader, Emperor Palpatine and Luke and the destruction of the second Death Star. The lightsaber fights are some of the best in the Star Wars cannon and Princess Leia is hotter than ever! John William's score is even more exciting than ESB. If I were to place the Star Wars films in order from best to worst, they would go THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, A NEW HOPE, RETURN OF THE JEDI, REVENGE OF THE SITH, ATTACK OF THE CLONES and THE PHANTOM MENACE.<br /><br />This presentation is very impressive, with added scenes and improved SFX. I like that Temuera Morrison's lines are dubbed over the original Boba Fett lines, and Ian McDiarmid in Empire is satisfying. The digital touch up is excellent and the DVD extras are exhaustive and impressive, especially the making of documentary. Watching these movies, one wonders what happened to Lucas' talent.n's lines are dubbed over the original Boba Fett lines, and Ian McDiarmid in Empire is satisfying.

B000002I4S|5.0|I generally don't leave reviews for albums that have over ten reviews. By ten reviews, the Amazon community usually writes about all that needs to be written about any given disc.  Regardless of  \\"Giant Steps\\" having over one-hundred reviews, I couldn't resist giving my two cents about one of the all-time best records. This is perfect music. In regards to this point, there is no interpretation or relativity. \\"Giant Steps\\" has no unnecessary notes. Jazz doesn't get any better than John Coltane's 1959 masterpiece. There are good jazz albums; there are great jazz discs and then there are recordings like \\"Giant Steps\\" that you will play over and over again throughout your entire life. Some Amazon reviewers will casually give five stars to a disc because it doesn't have anything wrong with it. I awarded \\"Giant Steps\\" five stars because it is simply one of the best musical investments that you can make.  \\"Giant Steps\\" is a religious experience and an essential part of any jazz collection.
630521610X|5.0|There's more than a few reasons to hate `Scream'; the main reason would be that the film single-handedly resurrected the teen-slasher genre, a movie category that had long been beaten to death. Because of the success of `Scream', witless horror rubbish like `I Know What You Did Last Summer' and `Urban Legend' got greenlighted, half the teenage casts of various WB television shows got summer acting jobs, and some awful scripts that should've been left dead and buried `Teaching Mrs. Tingle' got to see the light of day. `Scream' is responsible for a lot of garbage. But the truth of the matter is, `Scream' is also a phenomenal movie.<br /><br />Director Wes Craven was perfect for this film- as director of slasher classics like `Nightmare On Elm Street', he easily sets the visual feels and style of film to perfect evoke all the slasher films of yore . . . and then, much like `Scream's' script, chooses to either faithfully follow the tried and true, or to go off in competely unexpected directions. Either way, Craven manages to create a lot of absolutely nail-biting, thrilling scenes. He also doesn't hold back with the gore, which is always a plus in great slasher films.<br /><br />The best slasher film of all time is still John Carpenter's `Halloween', without question, but `Scream' actually runs a close second. It's well worth watching.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|Musical boundaries? Rock conventions? Normalcy? The Mars Volta's \\"Frances The Mute\\" is one big \\"F**k you\\" to all these things, and basically everything else you thought you knew about music. No where on this album do you find a 3 minute radio-friendly pop song. Everything reeks of progressive rock. The shortest song is 6 minutes, and the longest surpasses 30. That's right, a 30 minute song. If that's not enough to impress you into buying this album, than the pure musical ability of The Mars Volta should be enough.  The cryptic lyrics tell a running story through out the album about a drug-addicted, male prositute seeking revenge against the preists who raped his mother and, thus, impregnanted her with him. Interesting, no? Omar Rodriguez, lead guitarist, plays amazingly. His solo's are out of this world, sometimes being tight, hard, and pounding, and other times chaotic, mellow, and wandering in all directions. Cedric Bixler, vocalist, is beautifully expressive. He has the ability to pull you in and listen to every word of his dizzying tale, wether he's singing in english or spanish, as he frequently jumps between the two languages throughout the album. And, of course, the rest of the band deserves credit as well. The bass lines, much like the guitar, are all over the place. Sometimes they're heavy, and sometimes they're barely there, or not at all. The use of twinkling keyboards and other electronic sounds adds to the mystique of the sprawling music landscape that is \\"Frances\\". Sometimes all other instruments are abandoned in favor of 3-minute or longer blocks of rambling electronics. Salsa-flavored keyboards make an appearance on \\"L'Via L'Viaquez\\" and a collection of horns are added to the mix in \\"Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore\\" and the half-hour masterpiece that is  \\"Cassandra Gemini\\". All in all, this album is unbelievable, and should be bought as soon as possible.
0780626966|4.0|The original NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET (1984) breathed new life into the slasher genre, courtesy of director Wes Craven (The Hills Have Eyes, Scream) and more importantly, introduced the world to Robert Englund and Johnny Depp! The law of diminishing returns rears its obscenely ugly head with the numerous sequels in this box set, but there is something really fun about sitting down for several hours and ensconcing yourself with 7 gory little slahsers. NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 2: FREDDY'S REVENGE (1985) is actually a really good follow up to the first, with some effective shocks and plenty of gore to satisfy bloodlust fans. NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 3: DREAM WARRIORS (1987) is less impressive, with director Chuck Russell focusing more on gore than effectual shocks, but there are plenty of buxom girls and clueless male knife fodder. Renny Harlin's A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 4: THE DREAM MASTER is a vast improvement, showcasing some arty camera tricks and proving to be probably the scariest of all the films. A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 5: THE DREAM CHILD (1989) and FREDDY'S DEAD: THE FINAL NIGHTMARE (1991) are shadows of the previous film though, only managing to elicit a few good scares. WES CRAVEN'S NEW NIGHTMARE (1994) breaks away from the gaudy late 80s/early 90s splatter and goes for a more subdued tone, and thankfully works really well. An uneven set of movies, but a solid night in and some enormous extras on the DVDs means you'll have to fake a exceptionally long 'sickie' from work to watch them all.
B00005JNTX|1.0|You already know that this is going to be the first of about 3 dvd's released for this film. With virtually no special features, the only one of which is a behind-the-scenes featurette which was available for FREE at Best Buy, this is the studio at it's greed point. You know there will be a super-ultimate-limited-for-the-fans-only 10 disc set coming just in time to piss you off because you've already spent money on this craptacular bare-bones disc. <br /> <br />Count me out.
1573223026|5.0|Why has the press been so hard on this delightful, touching, funny and human book?  Now, I fully admit to being a huge Nick Hornby fan - from Fever Pitch all the way through to The Polysyllabic Spree (if you missed this terrific collection of essays, don't!) I just love his writing, no questions asked.  And this novel is as good as his best - the four characters who trade narrative duties are completely realized and true individuals to the core.  And the story they tell is entertaining and moving - don't miss out on this new gift from one of the most exuberantly human writers at work today.
B0006Z2LCE|5.0|Hip-O's \\"Gold\\" compilation is an excellent retrospective of Donna Summer's career.  Summer is an amazing vocalist, probably one of the most underrated for the sheer talent and expressiveness she brought to her material.  \\"She Works Hard for the Money\\" is on a short list for my all-time favorite tracks with its pulsing beat & Summer's relentless vocal and blazing electric lead on the track, \\"Never sell out, she never will, not for a dollar bill, she works hard.\\"  \\"State of Independence\\" is also another incredible track written by Vangelis & Jon Anderson and has a \\"Yes\\" feel that Summer embodies delightfully with the gorgeous chorus and the percolating keyboards.  Donna drills the Drifters' classic \\"There Goes My Baby\\" with a pulsing rhythm track and her amazing vocals.  The first disc contains all the amazing gold records that blared \\"On the Radio\\" that made us know whether Donna was one of the \\"Bad Girls\\" or simply \\"Hot Stuff,\\" her music has an incredible energy and joy that still reads well 30 years after her first release.  If I had anything to add, her \\"Christmas Spirit\\" is my all-time favorite holiday album so I'd have loved to hear the title track tucked inside this collection.  Hip-O has done an excellent job with the remastering of the tracks, keeping the mix's bright sound.  Enjoy!

0385510454|3.0|Being Gresham's best work since his blockbuster the 'Firm' is not very high praise for a book. I don't think that he really is very much of a writer. There is something about his style though that makes for a pleasant way to pass the time of day away. The sheer ease of which his prose settles you down is pleasurable.<br /><br />What is amiss here is that Grisham really does not know what he is doing here. This is unlike anything he has yet written. It feels like a Robert Ludlum book in many ways. But Grisham proves his naysayers correct in that that this book is a very shoddy production. I was never sold from the very beginning that anything that occurs is in hindsight very convincing. I never bought that several nations would want to kill the protagonist. Nor am I buying that he would have A-been released from prison, B-been set up in the manner he was, and C- basically that anything here would have been plausible. I mean come on now, why did Grisham spend half the book teaching the guy Italian? It really never matters that he learned it. Why did Grisham set the story in Bolognia? I really think that it was only because it was a touristy spot. You can take on any aspect of the book and just pull it apart.<br /><br />Many times I found myself wondering if Grisham were trying to write a romance or a thriller. The components just don't fit together. And the generic protagonist that Grisham offers us is just so implausible in the role set out for him that it is laughable. Not once did he come across as anything other than a really nice guy. He was a plastic toy manipulated by Grisham in the same way a little kid plays with his Star Wars action figures.<br /><br />All of that aside, I did read the book quickly and did not hurry myself through a few meandering pages. The book will hook you and then fill you up like a plate of really bad for you junk food.
B00006L3S3|4.0|I'm astounded that the merit of this record is sometimes debated among hardcore JL fans.  Even though fairly slick, it is perhaps John's most listenable and consistent LP, thanks in part to the top-flight studio musicians. \\"Mind Games\\" and \\"Bring on the Lucie\\" show his idealistic side and remain great favorites. The rest of the tracks are an engaging mix of light love songs (some contented and relaxed, others slightly melancholy), and a few odd and fun tunes. Never a bore. Lennon was nowhere near the melodicist of McCartney -- consider how many of his Beatles tunes, excellent though they were, featured hovering around a single note or two -- but he does an excellent job of stretching on the hummability factor with this collection. If you're new to the Lennon canon, \\"Mind Games,\\" albeit on the mainstream side, is an excellent album to begin with and to prepare you for his less consistent efforts, most of which also contain great gems.
0385720920|2.0|this book was very mediocre at best. I think that the author covers up the poor execution of his novel here with graphic language. I have nothing against an author shocking a reader, but here it is just slathered on so thickly. And its not just that he uses words that will get censored out if I were to post them on Amazon, but primarily it is Palahniuk's desire to jump from one excruciating scene to the next with little plot or authorship tying them together. The novel just is not very well pasted together. I felt like he was trying to write a novel ala Richard Russo. By this I mean that Palahniuk strings together hundreds of antidotes in order to come away with an interesting story. I also thought several times about Russel Banks Rule of the Bone while reading this. I kept thinking that Banks pulled off what Palahniuk might have attempted.<br /><br />I heard some good things about Haunted, and am looking forwards to reading the latest offering by this author. But I do suggest that you might skip this book.
1401301363|5.0|I absolutely love Nigella's books, and this one is no exception. The layout is simple and sensual, and the varied recipes are easy to follow and relatively basic to make. Her work is an absolute joy to read; down-to-earth and comforting. <br /> <br />I particularly love the dense and moist chocolate honey cake, and infact, the entire chocolate cake hall of fame. The lamb shanks with fig and honey are also beautiful. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this work, as I would any of Nigella's books. Her prose and recipes are utterly enchanting.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|\\"Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of YOU!!\\" - Dave Grohl, 2005 <br /> <br />Those words sum up the entirety of these two stellar discs, probably Grohl's best effort ever.  It remains to be seen what else this Superman musician can do, but my money says he will go down as one of the best singer/songwriter's ever to live.  The rock part of this dual-disc effort is stunning, on par with Led Zeppelin's greatest work, while the acoustic portion of \\"In Your Honor\\" reminds me of \\"Led Zeppelin III\\" by the group Led Zeppelin. <br /> <br />Also, I really like how musician Grohl dedicated \\"In Your Honor\\" to Kurt Cobain.  What a classy move.   <br /> <br />\\"Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of YOU!!!!\\" Dave \\"the king\\" Grohl - 2005
B0000027I6|4.0|This solo effort sounds the closest  to Floyd out of those Waters has done to date.  It was released in 1993.     This disc is great but you have to learn to live with its inconsistencies. It is a choppy, random assemblage of tracks all segwayed together. Nowhere near as good as The Wall and a step below The Final Cut. There are moments of brilliance, but they just don't seem to last, leaving you wanting more.  Perhaps the most frustrating thing for me is the lyrics: Roger's lyrics on Dark Side, Wish You Were Here, Animals and The Wall were brilliant - but here he sounds like a blathering madman. Can anyone tell me, with any certainty, what these songs are about? At least his earlier lyrics were decipherable. Some of the other reviewers here have come up with clever interpretations of these lyrics, but I don't buy any of them. I do think Roger is a genius, but here is just BS-ing us. Most of these lyrics have no real meaning at all.    One cool thing about this disc is Jeff Beck's guitar work. What a great sound. There are a few really powerful guitar solos on this disc that alone make it worth the price.
B0007ZEO4G|5.0|1973: Deep Purple was in shambles. \\"Machine Head,\\" \\"Made In Japan\\" and \\"Who Do We Think We Are!\\" had transformed them into superstars and Ritchie Blackmore was now recognized as a guitar god, but egos and strife were splitting the band. In what would usually demolish other bands, Blackmore replaced two key members of the group. David Coverdale, an unknown, and Glenn Hughes of the cult band Trapeze were in, Roger Glover and Ian Gillian were out.<br /><br />But the band rose to the challenge. Bolstered by the prospect of using two lead singers, the band created an album that is second only to \\"Machine Head\\" is terms of consistency. Roaring forth with the title track, with Jon Lord's majestic organ and keyboards plus a killer riff from Blackmore, there was no way to deny that Deep Purple was once again a fireball. The other major contribution seemed to be the spark that Hughes and Coverdale brought to the band's writing. With the exception of \\"Sail Away\\" and the instrumental \\"A-200,\\" everyone of \\"Burn's\\" original 8 songs is a DP classic. After the \\"Stormbringer\\" album, Blackmore split and the albums afterwards just never measured up.<br /><br />So just absorb this classic example of what made early 70's rock so fabulous to listen to. There's the rocking blues of \\"Mistreated.\\" The great split vocals on \\"Might Just Take Your Life.\\" Blackmore's excellant solo on \\"Lay Down Stay Down.\\" Then on \\"You Fool No One,\\" proof that Ian Paice's drumming was as strong a backbone for Purple as any band could wish for.<br /><br />The bonus b-side \\"Coronarias Redig\\" is pretty much superfluous, and I can't really say what the value of the \\"2004 remixes\\" are supposed to be. The liner book is informative and interseting, too. 1974: \\"Burn\\" was the one last amazing album when Deep Purple had all the parts working together.
0812550706|5.0|Wow, this is just one of the best fiction books I have ever read.  Ender was an amazing character, brilliant and capable of overcoming all odds.  He was really inspiring, a little genius boy.  It was a science fiction book, but Ender's character was explored a lot rather than lots of aliens and space lasers.  There were some lasers and space type of things, but the main story revolved around characters and their development, and I liked that a lot.  I think subsequent books in the series are more geeky so I've stayed away from them, but this book is hands down one of my favorite of all time--read it!
B00007G1ZC|5.0|\\"Sun Under the Rain\\" is the first short film in this \\"movie.\\" As rain cascades onto a slate gray house, a young boy is told he must stay home. Soon his curiosity compels him to wander in the forest. The sunlight filters through mist weaving its way through the giant trees in layers of enchanting vertical art. At times the rain appears like glitter against the wet rust bark. There is a sense of mystery as the young boy hides behind a tree and watches a fantastical wedding procession. Upon returning home he is told he must face his fear and ask forgiveness (or die) for watching the fox's wedding procession. We are then rewarded with fields of flowers and a rainbow.<br /><br />This is the first in a series of eight short dreams that seem to be dealing with various elements of death. In the first movie, there is a choice between death or asking forgiveness. This introduces the idea of death and in the next short film about a peach orchard, the idea is taken one step further. The peach orchard is cut down and this introduces the idea of death in nature. Tree spirits discuss their tragic end with the child and dance in four magical rows where the trees were planted. As a child cries over the loss of the peach blossoms he says: \\"Peaches can be bought. But where can you buy a whole orchard of blossoms?\\" The first two films contain magical elements to surprise and delight the inner child.<br /><br />The Blizzard and Avalanche will try your patience at first, but as with many of the films, your patience is well rewarded. Just as we are losing hope, a snow goddess arrives and seems to be an angel of death lulling a climber into sleep, as if to calmly steal his soul while the wind whips her hair in an erotic dance of nature. As he lays covered in snow, she places layers of what appears to be a magical shawl over his shoulders. She keeps saying things like: \\"The ice is hot.\\" I kept thinking this was a study in hope and yet the elements of death were very present. Expect the unexpected in this section.<br /><br />The Tunnel brings us to the concept of fearing the unknown or not accepting our death. The walking dead appear and there is a sense of having lived an unfulfilled life or dying for causes that were not worth more than life itself. This is when Akira Kurosawa starts to delve into political aspects and death's stark reality in war. Another film shows the dangers of nuclear power and Mt Fuji glows with a ruby shimmer and seems to be melting. The images of the demons in pain gave me nightmares the night after I watched this movie. The images of blood-red lakes and demons, in what seems like emotional and physical agony, was enough to make me dream about hell. In fact the night after I viewed these short films, I had many \\"short film dreams\\" of my own.<br /><br />One of my favorite sections is \\"Crows,\\" where an artist steps into a Van Gogh painting. The film has many surprises, but very little plot. Mostly we are viewing two painters walking through their own art and discussing their view of the world. Crows is much more about visual delight and a surprising ending.<br /><br />\\"The Village of the Watermills,\\" takes place in a picturesque village complete with a dreamy river and little bridges. Here death is celebrated and life is revered. The water rushes over long flowing underwater grass growing from the riverbed. We are faced with questions about our modern reality. Is it as comforting as living in a village? Is our modern village somewhat lacking in community? Do our funerals focus too much on our sorrow and less on the celebration of a life well lived?<br /><br />I watched this twice and noticed quite a few new elements on the second viewing.<br /><br />I want to go sit by the river in the Watermill village and watch the long grass weave back and forth in the water and the child in me wants to be walking in the front of the funeral procession, tossing flower petals in front of the dancers.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewsection.

0440237688|5.0|Amazing book, period.  It shows a futuristic society and a young boy's plight within it.  He is chosen to be a special kind of savior for the society, and the book chronicles how he deals with that responsibility/burden.  The boy lives in a utopia, but of course utopia is not possible and he is the only one who sees the shortcomings in his society.  It is a struggle for him to be the only one who understands these things.  This is the kind of book that you cannot put down; every time I have read it has been in one sitting.  It's short enough so that you can do that, but such a powerful story is packed within it.  When people ask me my favorite book ever, this one invariably comes to mind first.  If you haven't read it, you are missing out on a lot.
1400032717|5.0|Christopher Boone is the 15-year-old (15 years, 3 months, and 3 days old at p. 40), high-functioning autistic narrator of this story, which begins with his discovery of Mrs. Shears' dog, Wellington, dead on her lawn, stabbed through with a \\"garden fork.\\" Christopher is a fan of Sherlock Holmes (but not of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, since he believed in things that weren't true). He decides to apply detective skills and logic to the case and make that the focus of a book he is writing for school.<br /><br />This is not quite the ordinary mystery novel. In the process we learn quite a bit about Christopher's mental life, his lack of understanding of human social skills, his mathematical capability, his unusual ways of categorizing days.  Christopher also knows a wealth of facts, and the book touches upon details of Sherlock Holmes stories, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's being fooled about the Cottingley Fairies, astronomy, the Turing Test, and studies of children's awareness of and reasoning about the existence of other minds, among other things. As these are all topics of interest to me, I was entertained and amused to see Christopher use them in figuring out the world around him.<br /><br />Haddon does a great job of depicting Christopher's viewpoint and making a person empathy-deficient into a sympathetic character.
0517548232|5.0|In one short book, the guy covers all the basic concepts of free market economics.  In every chapter I felt I learned a small lesson.  I think the title is true to its name.  The book is relatively old, but economics is a subject where that doesn't matter all that much to discuss the fundamentals.  The examples provided are general rather than specific, so in that way it's a rather timeless book.  You should enjoy it a lot if you are a proponent of capitalism.  If not, beware and you might hate it.
1400032717|5.0|This book immediately reminded me of Sherlock Holmes (even before the book itself made this parallel). It's a character study masquerading as a mysetry. The main difference is that this story is considerably more predictable than Sherlock Holmes. My first instinct as to the dog-killer was correct. (All too often in a Sherlock Holmes story you can't figure out the ending because it all hinges on some observation made by Holmes that he doesn't reveal until the very end.)  <br /> <br />From my layman's point of view, I thought the author was very accurate in his portrayal of Christopher (the main character). I hadn't read anything about the book before I bought it, so I had incorrectly \\"diagnosed\\" Christopher with Asperger Syndrome because he had such logical thought and was quite articulate, which is more than I expect from an autistic person (I don't mean to offend; I have no real experience with autism or asperger syndrome, so can only go by what I read, which isn't much.). I was surprised to learn how young the author was when he wrote the book, and hope he continues to write with the same insight.
B000002UAX|5.0|This is my favorite album of all time.  It has more great songs than any other Beatles album.  Of course, the fact that it's a double album probably has something to do with that.  Classic songs like \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\", \\"Dear Prudence\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", \\"Blackbird\\", \\"Helter Skelter\\", etc.  Even the \\"filler\\" like \\"Wild Honey Pie\\" is fun.  Of course, the most controversial track here is \\"Revolution 9\\".  This eight minute \\"sound collage\\" was a radical experiment for a \\"pop group\\" at the time, and even today it is reviled by many people.  But if you listen to it with an open mind, it's actually quite interesting.  No need to take my word for it, though.  Buy it now!
B00000DGUY|3.0|As with _Money for Nothing_, the previous compilation, editing these mostly-terrific songs down did allow them to fit in more tracks -- but sometimes it needs to be more about the quality than the quantity.  I must also disagree with the Amazon editorial review which suggests that this disc plus _Making Movies_ equals \\"the essential Dire Straits.\\"  \\"The essential Dire Straits\\" simply can't exist in the absence of \\"Telegraph Road.\\"
B00009V7P8|5.0|Damien Rice's voice, combined with the cello has the power to make you want to cry. I heard \\" Blower's Daughter\\" when i bought the \\" Closer\\" DVD. I didn't even know who he was but i sat in front of the t.v pausing and rewinding the credits to figure out who was singing the song. i immediately bought the cd and it has been a romance ever since. And for anyone who wants to buy the cd you should listen to the bonus track that comes after \\"Eskimo\\", just wait a few minutes after the song ends and another song will start. that song i believe, closes the chapter on the entire cd. This cd is worth buying, all the songs are beautiful.
B00007E8O5|5.0|post-grunge. that phrase right there also means 'the death of good music' in most people's eyes. grunge (or alternative in general of that time frame...i mean you cant call the smashing pumpkins grunge and they are one of the best alternative bands ever and they got big at the same time AIC did...) was the explosion of alternative rock in the early 90's that had the chance to bring forth another golden age of rock, but internal struggles tore it all down before its true potential could be reached (imagine breaking up led zeppelin right after 3, or the beatles right after revolver). nirvana's implosion is documented enough for the world, the world still doesnt know why soundgarden or the smashing pumpkins called it quits...but perhaps the most tragic tale of grunge death is that of alice in chains.  <br /> <br />alice in chains were the most metallic, heavy (although badmotorfinger soundgarden gives them a run for their money in that category), and just, DOWN band of grunge. alice in chains focused writing sounds to match their personal troubles-specifically, a tragic heroin addiction on the part of layne staley. Layne got bad-real bad. and after AIC's self titled, they simply couldnt tour. or even get in the studio. it was sad, but still the brains behind the AIC operation-mr. jerry cantrell-wasnt so disabled from recording. cantrell released a solo album 'boggy depot'-which i admit i still havent heard yet-but plan on hearing-and in 2002 jerry released 2 versions of his sophmore try- degradation trip, the one disc version and the, as you will see, far superior 2 disc version.  <br /> <br />in fact, this 2 disc version is so superior to the one disc version, it astounds me how someone would settle for the one disc version at all. this 2-disc version is so good-beats anything since the start of the millenium, it beats binaurial and riot act (both of which i loved), it beats mesmerize and toxicity, it even beats NILE's astounding 'in their darkened shrines' and new 'annhiliation of the wicked' (2 must haves for any Death metal fan). simply put, if this was done as an AIC album (say released in 1997-2 years after their last album), it would have not only, in my mind, saved grunge, but also been AIC's biggest album by far. <br /> <br />-disc 1- <br />1. psychotic break-10/10-incredible guitar layering on this one, will bring a smile to any AIC fan <br />2. Bargain basement...-8/10-a bit of a letdown, but a nice crunchy, sludgy number <br />3. owned-9/10-like a much improved bargain basement, like the lyrics <br />4. angel eyes-10/10-amazing song, HOW THE HELL ISNT THIS A ROCK RADIO STAPLE? it astounds me... <br />5. solitude-9/10-a pretty acoustic number, just like all good alternative somber songs, it manages to both make you feel the singer's pain AND be able to hum along and sing like any rock song too... <br />6. mother's spinning in her grave-10/10-great rocker here, sounds like a very eclectic sequel to 'godsmack' <br />7. hellbound-10/10-WOW. this is a definetly pissed off, dank, murky AIC update. this would fit great with anything on dirt-and good god that intro is badass. <br />8. spiderbite-9/10-crunchy and maybe over-distorted, spiderbite rocks, and the chorus is jarring and totally comes out of nowhere. <br />9. pro-false idol-8/10-its good, take my word for it, but it seems this song just overlasts its welcome, its over 7 minutes long-but the lyrics most definetly about layne save it. <br />10. feel the void-10/10-among the most creepy on the disc-never explodes into a cantrell-esque metal/grunge rocker, it just jars you and doesnt stop. <br />11. locked on-9/10-i compare this to owned-they seem like brother and sister songs, but locked on's sudden change is much more affective than owned's. <br />12. gone-10+/10- whoa. this is truly a tearjerker, it seems as if this song was written SPECIFICALLY for when layne kicked the can, and may just be the best on the 2-disc set. <br /> <br />-disc 2- <br />1. castaway-10/10-another great rocker, creepy intro and sick lyrics that take a disturbing take on being isolated-the 'cracked lips' line always gets me... <br />2. chemical tribe-10+/10- another incredible song, chemical tribe shows what jerry can really do, and in a shocking way, with the 'bitchslapped' chorus infesting your mind with its catchyness... <br />3. what it takes 10+/10-have i said disc 2 was better? because without a doubt it is. what it takes is an acoustic song done just oddly-with a great wordless chorus (jerrys good at those) <br />4. Dying Inside-8/10-starts off great, then shifts to acoustic, then powers back up to distorted metal-but it never really reverts back to the insane shifts, which is why it only got an 8 <br />5. siddhartha-9/10-hints of psychodelia? in jerry cantrell? odd. again shows how diverse cantrell is with this 2-disc format <br />6. hurts, dont it?-*/10-i dont rate instrumentals, but dang this one is awesome. <br />7. she was my girl-7/10- too commercial. it rocks, but it seems so out of place with the rest of the songs here. <br />8. pig charmer-10/10-nice return to form. catchy, long, and a big F*ck you to the rock star lifestyle <br />9. Anger rising- 10+/10-by far one of the best rockers on here, this song is literally on the levels of man in the box or junkhead- its catchy, it thrashes, it'll make you jump around and scream the lyrics. <br />10. SOS-9/10- great, not as crunchy as anger rising, but sick, just disturbing lyrics here <br />11. give it a name-9/10-actually, this is a quite nice change of pace-shorter (only 4 minutes-compared to 8-6-5 minutes for the last 3 songs) and it once again rocks. <br />12. thanks anyway-8/10-this is really the only song i havent completely analyzed yet to tell the truth...i seem to skip it to always hear: <br />13. 31/32-10+/10- like gone's tougher older brother, its not as emotional as that one, but it packs one hell of an emotional punch and it never overstays its welcome, even if it's over 7  mins long. <br /> <br />simply put, i cannot give this any higher reccomendation. to any AIC fan, alternative fan, metal fan, or especially grunge fan, pick this up ASAP!
B000062YAZ|4.0|Well, I've listened to practically every thrash influenced metal band out there(the ones heavily influenced by it, since most metal bands have been at least slightly influenced by thrash) and this is the album that started it all. And while I like the new depth At The Gates's _Slaughter of the Soul_(Not to mention the later work of the Bjorler brothers, The Haunted, which is practicalyl a tribute band to slayer) and the way KMFDM applied thrash guitars to their industrial sound, this album is definitely a good listen. <br /> <br />The opener \\"Angel of Death\\" basically kills all of the other songs on the album, which is not a good thing for an opener to do. It basically sets the par for what the rest of the album could do, with it's flurry of chugging guitars, darker lyrics(at the time, nowadays we have Cannibal Corpse screaming \\"I SKULLF-ED A NUN WHILE !#%$@$ HER !$#@! @!$#@\\", but Slayer were intelligent) and possibly the angriest guitar solo I have ever heard, which comes out of nowhere just when I thought the song was coming. <br /> <br />I won't say this album reduced me to the drooling mess that metal bands like Strapping Young Lad, Kiuas or At The Gates did, it does have its weak points. The first off is the drums, they are somewhat bland an uninteresting. Secondly the vocals, which while they had intelligent lyrics, have very few high points otherwise(the scream at the start of \\"Angel of Death\\" was pretty good though). I could say the length is a weak point, but I really do not feel it is. Slayer do not have that much song variety, and half an hour of their music is all I would really want at a time.(A lot of the newer metalcore bands could learn from this) <br /> <br />In the end I would say I love _Reign In Blood_ more for the things it spawned than the actual album itself.
B0000062GK|4.0|To each his own, but I can't for the life of me understand why some people want to talk crap about Satch.  I think these people must be one of those Jazzbo's who think they have cornered the market on music (I completely respect and admire jazz music/musicians by the way).  To say that moving compositions aren't good music is just completely closed minded, as much so as saying that disordered dissonance isn't good music.  Most of Satch's albums take a few listens for me to like them, because you have to close your eyes and just feel the emotion and intensity in his melodies.  Crystal Planet's a keeper, just like any other Satriani CD I've ever heard. <br />Don't even get me started on mainstream music hahahaha...get this album, along with Strange Beautiful Music, Is There Love In Space and The Electric Joe Satriani...give em a few listens, and you have any passion in your soul at all, you'll like them as much as I do.

B00005JNJT|5.0|Christopher Nolan and his co-screenwriter, David Goyer have chosen to postpone the crossover of Bruce Wayne (a soulful Christian Bale)  into Batman until half way through the new \\"Batman Begins.\\"<br />And this is a crucial and important step that Nolan puts off until Bruce walks the earth in search of his own personal nirvana... in a sort of Christ-like journey to understand himself and his place in the world after his parents are brutally murdered. It is also from this quest that he acquires the knowledge and skills necessary for him to become a warrior, ready and able  to combat the ills  and rid his town Gotham of all evil-doers.<br />Nolan's \\"Batman Begins\\" is a more macho, masculine film than were the previous movies, which is not to take anything away from Tim Burton's elegiac, gothic and visionary takes on this story. But Burton's world is/was/ and will always be the world of the dreamer: his Batman is more sinned against than sinning. His Batman needs love and understanding while Nolan's wants and needs justice and revenge more than anything else: even the sultry Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes proves to be of little interest to Batman save a chaste kiss at the end of the movie. It's interesting to note that in the previous Batman films we had big beautiful bombshells like Kim Bassinger and Nicole Kidman as the so-called love interests while here, in Nolan's vision we have a more scrubbed clean, working class (Rachel is an assistant D.A.) heroine: a woman who is as interested in righting wrongs as is Batman and not merely someone meant as an adornment to the suave debonair Batman of Val Kilmer, George Clooney or Michael Keaton. It's an important and telling shift from woman as a plush toy to one who is, not only beautiful but also smart and dedicated to a cause other than self-promotion and self-satisfaction.<br />Christian Bale's Batman is real..i.e. a genuine, fleshed-out, beautifully written movie character: he is conflicted, he makes mistakes, he trusts the wrong people at times and he pays for his mistakes. It is a remarkable casting coup to have Bale in this role particularly since of late he has been playing a spate of radicals...i.e. in \\"The Machinist,\\" in which he transforms himself into a skeleton...literally. As Bruce Wayne/Batman, Bale dons the mask, assumes the persona, not out of a lust for power but out of a fervent belief that good will always triumph over evil: several times in this film he is brought to task for his trust in the basic goodness of people and one of his mentors ( Liam Neeson as Ducard) even goes so far as to ridicule Bruce as sentimental and weak for it. Though Ducard is his mentor and sensei, this relationship proves to be fraught with ambiguity as the movie progresses to the climax.<br />What is a Batman film without its villains? But this film is devoid of the cartoon craziness of the Riddler or the Joker. Here we have Cillian Murphy (so good in \\"28 Days Later\\") as a scary-as-hell The Scarecrow, alias psychiatrist Dr. Jonathan Crane, who spews his  psychedelic paranoia and psychosis on an unsuspecting Gotham. His \\"stuff\\" is more thrilling and frightening than anything that the aforementioned villains could ever muster.<br />\\"Batman Begins\\" is not only a physically gorgeous film, it is also an emotionally and ideologically complicated one. It wears its heart on its sleeve, yes...but it also has the brains and a profoundly strong back and pumped up physicality to back it up.e at times and he pays for his mistakes. It is a remarkable casting coup to have Bale in this role particularly since of late he has been playing a spate of radicals...i.e. in \\"The Machinist,\\" in which he transforms himself into a skeleton...literally. As Bruce Wayne/Batman, Bale dons the mask, assumes the persona, not out of a lust for power but out of a fervent belief that good will always triumph over evil: several times in this film he is brought to task for his trust in the basic goodness of people and one of his mentors ( Liam Neeson as Ducard) even goes so far as to ridicule Bruce as sentimental and weak for it. Though Ducard is his mentor and sensei, this relationship proves to be fraught with ambiguity as the movie progresses to the climax.  What is a Batman film without its villains? But this film is devoid of the cartoon craziness of the Riddler or the Joker. Here we have Cillian Murphy (so good in \\"28 Days Later\\") as a scary-as-hell The Scarecrow, alias psychiatrist Dr. Jonathan Crane, who spews his  psychedelic paranoia and psychosis on an unsuspecting Gotham. His \\"stuff\\" is more thrilling and frightening than anything that the aforementioned villains could ever muster.   \\"Batman Begins\\" is not only a physically gorgeous film, it is also an emotionally and ideologically complicated one. It wears its heart on its sleeve, yes...but it also has the brains and a profoundly strong back and pumped up physicality to back it up.
B000957O82|4.0|WOW!  What a great movie!  Very funny and worth the time to watch!  Enjoyed the lightheartedness and charisma of the plot.  A must see for someone who's looking for something to laugh and have fun with.  Plan on buying the DVD!
B0006IIKS0|4.0|i was not sure if i would enjoy this documentary. however i am a fan of metallica and it was very interesting to see the band  in a different light. very personal. very effective.
0553582445|4.0|dont get me wrong... i love everything about hobbs writing... her charecterisation and all that crap... but she has this level of emotion that is lacking in ALOT of stuff thats coming out lately ((in the past 5 years??))  <br /> <br />kk... quick summery... its good... it starts off brilliantly... but ther just isnt enough emotional about it... even towards the end in 'that important part' it really was rushed somewhat... and i h8 to say that about hobb... but if it wasnt for her lack of ((or in contrast to her other books... because she is really above most, if not every other fantasy authur in terms of sheer, raw emotion)) emotional contact in the latter parts of the book, then i would give it 5 stars... but really... this book is lacking this department... thank god the next book is so friggin good!!
034544678X|5.0|I am impressed with McConnell's approach to help us be better dog-owners. I am new to dogs. I've read 4 other dog training books and have taken 2 extended obedience courses (by certified trainers) with my dogs. Yet no one really addressed how we humans, as primates, are hard-wired to try to communicate with our dogs in a way that is not in our best interests, such as looking them in the eyes, hugging, and varying our vocalizations. Thus I disagree with previous reviewers who said this book does not provide practical advice; by page 40 it vastly improved my interactions with my dog and thus my ability to improve her behavior. I am a wildlife biologist and this book makes complete sense. I am recommending it to all my dog-loving friends. The only minor complaint is they could have been more efficient with photos and showed more techniques or dog expressions (such as what a dog looks like when it retracts it's commissure...)
B00006EXL5|5.0|This Cd is the best dark edgy and great to listen to my fav song Demolition Lovers i like how its a two part song very kool. I could listen to this cd evry day 4ever and ever. It has one of my fav. lines in a song evr \\"oh how wrong we were to think immortality meant never dying\\" Our Lady of Sorrows. One thing to note since they have gona main stream *tear they will get more money and make more cds but the sound changed in 3 cheers this is there best cant wait to hear more
B000002KDO|5.0|Why is it when you hear a Sabbath song like \\"Into The Void\\" or \\"Lord Of This World\\",it feels as if there's more going on than 4 talented joes playing music?Sabbath's music,on this album in particular,has a life of its own.Ozzy's psychotic wails to Iommi's ingenius hell-born chords,there really is a sense of higher awareness when you listen to Sabbath,especially with the thought provoking lyrics Ozzy or Geezer would pen.The 2 classical-influenced instrumentals are both terrific and are placed nicely between the heavier songs.\\"Solitude\\" is a great mellow piece which calms things down a little before \\"Into The Void\\" kicks in at full force.Everytime I put any of there CDs in,I still get chills down my spine when I hear Iommi just drag a chord lower than I thought it could go.The band is all top notch here.Bill Ward and geezer Butler give an excellent performance here and showcase why they are one of rock's greatest rhythm sections.If you want quality heavy rock music that will truly take you somewhere else,then look no further than Black Sabbath,the lords of Heavy Metal.
B00005KHJR|3.0|You can only be horrified by this movie if you are a devout Christian. Otherwise it's a dreamy folkloric movie.  Half way into  the movie you figure out why's Howie there and what's gonna happen to him. So the finale doesn't come as a shock, but is still powerful to a certain extent. <br /> <br />The Jesus parallels, the true meaning of sacrifice, the nature of faith, questioning the New Testament's Christ died for our sins rhetoric(or was he sacrificed in hopes of favorable crops), pagans avenging a Christian; they are all beautiful concepts.  <br /> <br />The movie lacks a feeling of suspense and mystery say like in Don't Look Now where the eerie atmosphere builds up to an unexpected finale. It is also detached in tone, so the viewer is kept at a certain distance at all times. <br /> <br />It is definitely not a horror movie, not even a thriller or really eerie but still provides some unique moments, especially via very authentic looking  <br />rituals and aforementioned concepts. <br /> <br />I also read that a longer version of the movie is available which provides more psychological background on Sergeant Howie and more blasphemous footage. I thought it was nicely shot and edited considering this was directed by a first-timer(and later on butchered by the studio). <br /> <br />You'll enjoy this if you like off-beat movies and have interest in theology and paganism. But if you are a Christian who takes the Bible literally view it at your own risk.
B000002MG1|5.0|This was the first R.E.M. CD I heard, and in the first 5 seconds of \\"Drive\\" I was hooked.  Just that tiny portion of the intro was so unique to their kind of 90s' music that I listened to the whole album that night.  This is arguably the best R.E.M. album, and once you start that CD player, you won't want to put it down.  With clever lyrics and odd yet well used instruments, this album proves that R.E.M. is a really good band.  The best tracks, in my opinion are: <br /> <br />Drive  <br />Monty got a Raw Deal <br />Man on the Moon <br />Everybody Hurts <br />Try Not to Breathe <br /> <br />My favorite things about Automatic For the People are the intros and the way they use classic instruments (piano, acoustic or classic guitar, ukelele, etc.) throughout their songs.  They all blend to make a mix of the best instruments, vocals, effects, and great songwriting.  Unfortunately, this is not the case for the other CDs, which are good but not at the same level as Automatic for the People. <br /> <br />I'd definitely say buy this CD, and you won't be disappointed.
B0006L16N8|1.0|straight to the point - boring and unoriginal - every song sounds the same - starts getting annoying by the third song
B00000AFWZ|5.0|This is rock music at its very best-- raw, unpolished, and full of passion.  America's answer to the British Invasion.  While some bands on this compilation may be familiar to the average listener, it's the lesser known acts that really shine.  While pre-punk garage bands like the Remains, Music Machine, Shadows of Knight, We the People, and countless others never gained popularity, fame, or recognition in their time, their lasting influence on future genres of hard rock, punk, alternative and grunge has been huge.  But forget about influence and significance; just buy it for the amazing collection of music.  The Nuggets compilation is easily at the very top of my desert island disks.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Although not considered the \\"real\\" first Batman movie, 1966's BATMAN with Adam West, a quick knock-off to capitalize on the campy classic TV series, is a fun DVD...but an awful movie.<br /><br />Tim Burton's BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS hardly qualify much better, to be honest.  It was difficult to accept Michael Keaton as the Dark Knight.  Jack Nicholson steals the first movie.  And Tim Burton can't get any action momentum going to save his life.<br /><br />Joel Shummacher's BATMAN FOREVER and BATMAN AND ROBIN are actually just big-budget camp entries that should've been called THE AMBIGUOUSLY GAY DUO: THE MOVIES.<br /><br />So not a very high bar to jump....<br /><br />But, happily, BATMAN BEGINS arrives and it's easily the best Batman movie ever made.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan, the director responsible for MEMENTO, and the writers actually take what would be considered the dullest part of the story--Bruce Wayne's early life--and make it fast-paced and interesting.<br /><br />Christian Bale easily out-bats everyone else who ever put on the cape and cowl.  I loved how he appears from the dark in the Bat's early scenes and literally snarls at everyone he speaks to.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is incredible: Michael Caine as Alfred the Butler and Gary Oldman as Sgt.-then-Lt. James Gordon stand out.  Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, and Rutger Hauer are also on hand to add weight to the proceedings.<br /><br />Dark, psychological, well-paced and well written, interesting--this is the best Batman movie ever made, and I can't wait for the next one!<br /><br />(Cool set up for the next entry at the end too, by the way)
B000065U1N|5.0|At the being it starts out slow with boring stuff but it turn's into a whold new different movie when the war beings in the city part of Sombia. The action was long and more realistic. When one helicopter crashes it's about those soilders trying their best to get to the crash site then another one crashes. Even little aferican kids had machine guns trying to fight. It all ended when soilders got to Paskistan staduim.
B0007Y4TVU|2.0|This has to be the worst album of their career. It is no way near the quality of Toxicity which I consider one of best albums. I don't understand people can call it the 'best' of S.o.a.D, because it is simply not! Apart from 'Cigaro' and 'Violent Pornography', all the songs have LOST the moshing effect of powerful riffs, destructive drumming and vocal consistency and originality.  <br /> <br />Speaking of vocals, they are lame, annoying and weak. B.Y.O.B has to be one of the most irritating commercialised song lately that trendies have started listening to. I'm absolutely disappointed because S.o.a.d is my favourite band. I hope their next album has something better to offer. <br /> <br />
B00005JNJT|3.0|This better be the last Batman movie they ever make. Their have already been four Batman movies and now a fifth on when will Hollywood make something orginal. To me Batman is going out of style and nobody watches the cartoon show on the WB. Morgan Freeman is in this movie I think he is  good actor. I saw previews advertised on TV it looks good but enough. A horses breathes fire in theis movie.
B0009A1AS2|2.0|I was eagerly awaiting the release of DT's new album Octavarium but after listening to it intensely it has left me thoroughly disappointed, this to me is a run of the mill release with very little substance and it doesn't leave you with a feeling of wanting more, all I can say is get Kevin Moore back and give us that sound the band once had with Image and Words, Awake, and the legendary A Change of Seasons
B0006L16N8|3.0|Look, I think coldplay makes wonderful BACKGROUND music and that is about it.  I find the lead sings voice to sound very feminine and I do not dig that...  They opened up #1 in every  <br />nation on the planet and when have record sales corresponded to talent in the last twenty years?  Let them wash dishes for the next few years... You tell me gwennie would have given this gaunt looking lead singer a second look if they were not the \\"in thing\\",  I say not...  Book them to play in Fallujah this summer I say..
B0000WN0ZK|4.0|But what classic doesn't?<br /><br />Antonioni is very purposeful in his approach to this, surely not his best, but very effecting and shocking film of 1966. The David Hemming's character is a stand in for the general 60's Brittish mentality - artful, free, contridictory, undisciplined - talented yet missing the big picture...so to speak...he feels he is in control...but is he? Antonioni is nothing short of profound in his glimpse of reality and its mystery in this slightly dated classic. We do feel a certain nostolgia.. but, nevertheless it does not quite grab viewers like L'Aventura, La notte, or L'Eclisse - or maybe I should watch it again....maybe I missed something in my snapshot of a review....
B0000AQS0F|5.0|And I've seen alot. I use to be a tv'olholic but with the reality/talkshow vomit that is spewed now'a'days I had my programming canceled. I just couldn't take it anymore. I kept hearing about Firefly and finally rented it on dvd.It starts out a little slow{anything good usually does.Have to introduce everyone properly}.Then it picks up the pace and it is a very interesting ride. I enjoyed it as much as a favorite book . {Anyone who loves to read will know what I mean.}I couldn't believe this show was cancelled. Just goes to show how stupid the network execs are. Oh, the sad state of television. Once upon a time we could enjoy television. Now you have to do ALOT of research just to find something decent.Trouble is ,after all that research, I didn't find anything. But I happened to hear of a CANCELLED  show called Firefly. Buy it. If you don't like it, sell it on ebay. People snap it up quick.
B000002KIT|5.0|I've heard Thin Lizzy throughout my whole life.  \\"Jailbreak\\" and \\"The Boys are Back in Town\\" are two vintage classic rock songs, but I never really had any special liking for either.  I decided to pick this CD up recently, because it was on sale and because I like to hear how a band performs live. <br /> <br />To my surprise, I found a real gem here.  <br /> <br />This CD is amazing.  First, these guys perform great live and the recordings of these songs are very, very well done.  Every guitar note, every bass lick, every drum beat is perfectly audible and in sync with the rest of the song.  The vocals are perfect and tuned to the volume of the rest of the song.  WHoever works the soundboard at Thin Lizzy concerts and re-masters their CDs is awesome. <br /> <br />So, CD quality aside, let's look at the band.  Songs like \\"Emerald\\" and \\"Massacre\\" are the types of songs I had never expected to hear from Thin Lizzy.  These are fast paced, loud, rock jams and are so different than their \\"hits\\".  \\"Dancing in the Moonlight\\" is by far my favorite song on the album, and I stil am amazed at how well they perform this live.  The bass on this song is really catchy and the vocals are so, for lack of better words, real.   <br /> <br />\\"Rosalie\\" is a really fun song and sticks in your head for the day.  \\"Still in Love with You\\" is a good love ballad, but is probably my least favorite on the album.  The rest of the songs are good and very much worth buying this album for. <br /> <br />To sum it up, the raw energy, emotion and power displayed by Thin LIzzy on this album, truely makes this a must have for any serious music fan.  Buy this album and you just can't be disappointed!
B00003CX5P|1.0|Worst star wars movie in lucasfilms history. This movie sucked. I suggest episdoe 3-6 those are the only ones really worth seeing....
1932907009|5.0|Newbies AND working screenwriters (and everyone in between) should buy this book! I'm certain that it will take its place on the top shelf with other screenwriting classics like Vogler's THE WRITER'S JOURNEY.  <br />Look, there are tons of screenwriting books out there. Many of them rehash old material, present convoluted theories, and are written by people who have only the slightest of working experience in the industry. Snyder is not only a produced screenwriter, but also has sold many high-concept features to the studios. He knows what he is talking about. <br />The book presents easy to use tools that will help you learn how to come up with and develop a screen story with a hook. I've tried Snyder's \\"beat sheet\\" for developing a bullet-proof screenplay structure (the technique is presented in the book), and it works. It's brilliant.   <br />I've read dozens of screenwriting books. Trust me. Get this one. It will save you time and money. Oh, and did I mention that it's a FUN read?
0316172324|3.0|Blink is an enjoyable and light read.  With the title Blink: The Power of Thinking without Thinking, one might imagine that the book provides some insight how to be amazingly brilliant without trying. <br /> <br />Not at all.  The author is essentially making a case for instincts and the \\"adaptive unconscious.\\"  The case is made by providing anecdotal (but enjoyable) stories for 250 pages. <br /> <br />The book could have very easily and effectively been condensed into a decent-sized article in Psychology Today.  In short, the concept behind the book was \\"done/got it/move on\\" in a few pages.  However, the testimonial/example stories themselves and the author's references to items that I now plan to read (such as Sources of Power by Gary Klein) made the book worth my time. <br /> <br />Again, this is not a book with \\"ah-ha\\" insights or \\"put an encyclopedia under your pillow and you'll be brilliant the next morning\\" solutions - it's a treatise on not ignoring feelings/instincts simply because you can't put your finger on WHY you know what you know. <br />
B0006L16N8|5.0|You're probably wondering why I'm giving this a 5 star eventhough I say it's alright.. Well, It has a few good songs.. I just like the rush of blood to the head cd a little better.. I can remember that When I was watching the WWE once, that \\"Clocks\\" was the song for WWE superstar Kurt Angle's return from necksurgery.. Since then, I've loved that song. Coldplay is a great band, so I give this a 5 star for them!
0375422889|5.0|Satrapis first book found her as a young girl caught up in revolutionary Iran.  She watches as her mother is stripped of a job and forced to donn religious idicoy to go about outside.  It ends with her going to Europe.  Now we learn what Europe had in stall for her, namely drugs, homosexuality(not her), sex, dating, liberalism, all those things that Iran was stripped of.  So we follow her back to Iran, back to enforced Relgiouns clothing, back to a society created by the Left, a society where women are unequal, where religious fascism is the staple and where her ever reverent comic style can be once again put to good use to educate and enthrall the audience about the evils of Religiousity forced upon society.<br /><br />What we see here is something more however, read between the lines this book says something deeper, namely that the same problems that enslave Iran, enslave Europe.  In Europe young women turn to prostitution, drug use and sexually explicit clothing as a way to enslave themselves to modern society and men who have no honor.  In Iran the smae enslavement is forced upon women by the government, in reverse order, the men are immoral, and women are closeted in Purdah.  We see here the irony.  In the free society(Europe) women throw away their earned freedoms in search of fulfilling mens sexual needs and their own psychiatric self hate.  In Iran women were forced to throw away their freedom by a liberally supported Islamic revolution.<br /><br />Which is better?  We are not left with a clear answer, however the obvious one is that in a none religious society people may choose their own path, rather then have their clothing mandated by the government.  This is a riveting account and a deep person will come to understand the choice facing the world and the choice facing the west in particular.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzman
B0001611DI|4.0|The film Dawn of the Dead is more than a gore-filled zombie fest; it is a political work on the excesses of our modern age of greed.  Like many other of Romero's works, Dawn of the Dead uses the horror genre to get a much deeper message across.  Individuals trapped in a shopping mall must battle the ever-growing number of undead who have convened there out of trace memories.  Just as the disease turns people into zombies, so too does blind consumerism.
B00005B36H|5.0|Despite my disbelief that i could find an album that was perfect in practically every aspect, i have discovered one and it is Lateralus.  The music is some of the most creative things i've ever heard, especially in Reflection and Disposition.  Tool's mastery of the most complex styles of music never ceases to amaze me, especially with the song Lateralis.  The lyrics in this CD ARE poetry.  As stupid as it may seem, i showed the lyrics for The Grudge to my English teacher and she agreed that it was poetic and very powerful, including allusions and epic metaphors to Saturn.  This is the CD that got me into Tool and because of it, i now own 5 of their CDs and a String Tribute.  In conclusion, if you don't have this CD, BUY IT NOW, you will not be disappointed.
B000002KIE|4.0|Never Mind the Bollocks (1977) was the Sex Pistols only studio album as a unit.  It also was a long work in progress,<br /><br />several producers and the fire/re-hire of chief music writer<br /><br />and bassist Glen Matlock (for studio work).  The ends results are a seamless rock album that's more hard rock than punk.  Whilst their contemporaries were releasing their second discs (The Damned and the Clash) the pistols were<br /><br />releasing this massively over dubbed and polished album upon the unsuspecting world.<br /><br />The angry lyrics from Lydon, the competant drumming of Cook, the smooth bass lines from Matlock and the guitar crunching three chord power from Jones are all displayed on this disc.  Sid vicious is credited on the album but he doesn't appear (laid up with Hepatitis whilst recording Holidays and Bodies) Lydon and company feel sorry for him and give him credit any ways (Jones did the bass work on the album's version.<br /><br />A brilliant disc but it's not a real punk album.  The music is too polished and refined.  Perhaps if they released it raw and gritty (like The Damned's first disc or The Clash's U.K.<br /><br />self titled album).  Lydon would split and form Public Image Limited, Glen Matlock would form Rich Kids, Sid Vicious would go to America and try to become a rock star whilst Cook and Jones would keep the Sex Pistols going before turning into The Professionals.<br /><br />Highly recommended, one of the essentials.<br /><br />(I would get Flogging a Dead Horse, it has all of their singles and it's not as refined and polished like NMTB).
B000069CWE|5.0|Honestly, i don't even like Linkin Park <br /> <br />I find most of their music to be kind of shallow and not very original.  This however, is not including Reanimation.  I preordered this CD and got it right when it came out.  At this time, i loved Linkin Park but i have grown to not really like them anymore.  Strangely, i still love this album.  I just find it to be so original despite the fact that its confined to being a collection of remixes.  The rappers that were featured were actually GOOD rappers like Pharoahe Monch and the other featured artists such as the lead singers from Korn, Staind, Orgy, and Taproot are also great.  This combined with the EXCELLENT mixing and creativity make this album great.  I especially love how each song connects to the other, having none of that blank space between songs.  Overall, i've had this CD for almost 3 years and I STILL LISTEN TO IT. <br /> <br />These aren't just remixes, these are recreations of the originals
B00005CDNF|5.0|ABBA self-titled album is my favorite of their catalog.  I don't like compilations (unless I want to hear what their other albums around like) and I really don't care for the band's disco phase.  All the songs on this album are pure cheesy pop.  Every song is worth listening to and the music will cheer you up (no wonder why everyone loved ABBA, young or old, punk or straight neck).  Great stuff.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of cheesy pop music.
B0007DAZW8|4.0|It seems that quite a few Daft Punk fans dislike this album. In my opinion though it was pretty good. The music on this album harkens back to the beats from Homework and mixes them with a bit of the mellow groves of Discovery. The resulting sound is quite different from the previous two albums, but enjoyable non the less. On the grand scale of things I would rate this album just below Discovery, but much better than their original Homework album.
B000002MI4|5.0|The Juliet Letters is a moving colaboration from Elvis Costello and the Brodsky String Quartet.  His deep vocals are complemented by the string quartet.  This album is<br /><br />neither fish nor fowl (classical or pop) it's just a musical<br /><br />exercise.  The strings are some of my favorite compositions,<br /><br />(viola, cello and violin).  Elvis Costello not only got the Brodsky Quartet a bigger audience but he inspired them to<br /><br />write their own music (a third of the songs are composed by the Quartet).<br /><br />While it might not be everyones cup of tea, the music is brilliant and Elvis reaches octave levels I thought I would never imagine he could ever attain.  Maybe sometime in the near future he'll work with them again.  I applaud him for taking such a bold step in making a non-commercial album.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0790729687|5.0|Although I never was a fan of Anne Rice, or even of vampire folklore (I know enough to have it hold up under scrutiny) This movie will be sure to enthrall nevertheless.<br /><br />First of all let me say that although Tom Cruise is indeed wonderful, most people have under praised the qualities of both Brad Pitt and Antonio Banderous. True the latter only has a short scene, but he puts on such a wonderful perfomance, we overlook that miscoming.<br /><br />Brad Pitt, well is just awesome, as the vampire Louise who tries to redeem himself by at first drinking the blood of animals so that he will not have to kill. Kill he must, which one night in desperation he drinks the blood of a little girl, accidently keeping her alive,Consiquently Lestat finds her and gives the girl to Louise as a present. Hoping that the child will quell and banish Louise's troubles of killing, and stay with him.<br /><br />Enter Kirsten Dunst as Claudia,who becomes Louse's daughter he never had, and the object of his outpouring of love and affection. Loved and Beloved, as the pair called each other, and so they where until the trouble started.....<br /><br />Dark, thrilling (bordering on racy) this movie is not for all tastes, especially for those that like the lighter side of life. But for those looking for a good movie full of passion, emotion, rage and carnage this is would be a good choice.
B00004VXF2|4.0|Metal Machine Music was either a.) Lou Reed trying to experiment with layered sounds and feed back or b.) getting back at the studio for making him release a certain amount of albums in a short time span.  Even he doesn't know the answer.  But what we have here is over and hour of layered noise.  Some of it's clever, the noise bounces around the speakers (don't try to listen to this with headphones 'cause you get a major headache).  Even though the album did diddly-squat in the U.S., the album was HUGE in Japan.<br /><br />If you want to know what all the hub-bub is all about then get this disc.  Even if you rarely listen to it just impress your friends and neighbors by playing it LOUD!
0553573403|5.0|First, let me tell you where I'm coming from.  I like to read, but I'm not set in any genre.  The most fantasy I've read consists of Tolkein and a smattering of Goodkind.  While I like the fantasy setting, fantasy novels and movies tend to be cliche, if you've read one, you've read 'em all.  Several friends recommended this book, and at some point I decided to pick it up and give it a whirl.  Somewhere around page 70, this book turned from a confusing collection of names and interesting characters, into a page flipping frenzy (those of you who read this should know exactly what I'm talking about).<br /><br />As has been stated in other reviews, Martin has created a \\"real\\" fantasy novel.  This is a novel that lightly touches on the fantasy, and gives you a gritty medieval epic.  George pulls no punches.  He knows what he wants in this story, he knows what has to happen, and he does what he needs to do to take it there.  I mean hell, he'll sacrifice characters when you least expect it.  And more so, Martin has a gift at taking so many different stories told in so many different points of view, and ending virtually every chapter with you saying \\"What the hell?!\\" as you frantically whiz through the next point of view only to think the same thing at the end of THAT chapter, only to eventually return to the original character's thread many chapters down the line saying to yourself \\"Oh yeah!  I almost forgot why I only got two hours of sleep last night!\\"  In my own opinion, this has given the genre the edge it needed to no longer be template stories, where you can swap out the names of creatures, characters, weapons and locations and come up with a different novel by a different fantasy author (snore).  As another reviewer stated better, you could take this story and put it in almost any setting, but it absolutely works where it is.  Martin lays down the magic at just the right moments in the story, so instead of being same ole same ole, it's damn cool.  It feels less like a Deus ex Machina (as magic ALWAYS is in fantasy novels), and more like an integral part of a fantastic tale.  Martin alludes to everything fantastical in his tale, you just need to pay attention in every chapter.  No last minute random dragons swooping in out of the sky and introducing itself to the main characters as they're flying away (thank God).<br /><br />Just a little sidenote, as related to me.<br /><br />Tolkein is PG.<br /><br />Jordan is PG-13.<br /><br />Martin is R.  AND IT'S AWESOME.  You can almost taste the blood.  But besides that, it's the blood of characters that you've become ridiculously emotionally attached to.  Say no more.<br /><br />And lastly, Tyrion, you are the MAN.  If someone ever makes me pick my favorite midget, you're it.ike a Deus ex Machina (as magic ALWAYS is in fantasy novels), and more like an integral part of a fantastic tale.  Martin alludes to everything fantastical in his tale, you just need to pay attention in every chapter.  No last minute random dragons swooping in out of the sky and introducing itself to the main characters as they're flying away (thank God). <br /> <br />Just a little sidenote, as related to me. <br />Tolkein is PG. <br />Jordan is PG-13. <br />Martin is R.  AND IT'S AWESOME.  You can almost taste the blood.  But besides that, it's the blood of characters that you've become ridiculously emotionally attached to.  Say no more. <br /> <br />And lastly, Tyrion, you are the MAN.  If someone ever makes me pick my favorite midget, you're it. <br /> <br />
B00005JNJT|5.0|ignore all the bad critics (luckily a few), they don't know what they're talking about. this one is perfect better than spider-man 2, and arguably as good as superman.  why is it better than spider-man 2 ? well in general, spider-man feels a bit comical -some would say that's how it's supposed to be done, but given that's true, it's still a bit melancholic. i think in reality even a poor hi-school student don't look that \\"sorry\\". Batman feels real all the way, it's more complex emotionally.  go watch it.....another strike from chris nolan.
B000002JPA|5.0|So glad I took the advice of all the devoted DT fans who recommended this cd. I'm not really a prog rock fan, but one listen to the samples convinced me to buy this cd. Thanks to all the loyal DT fans who turned me into a new DT fan!
B00005B4GU|5.0|All this stuff about \\"Listen to Radiohead more and you'll get it!!\\" is only partially true. Yes, there is an element to their music that needs to be... drawn out.  <br />  However, the main thing about Radiohead is the mood. This isn't the kind of CD you'd want to have as background music at a barbecue, or while you're driving around in the early afternoon. What is being misunderstood, though, is that it's not TRYING to be that music. This album, like all Radiohead albums (and Kid A especially), has an air of aggression mixed with an overwhelming depression. If you go into this CD looking for something to headbang to, you're going to be disappointed. Maybe there is something elitist about that, but somebody who walks into Schindler's List looking for an action movie is isn't going to be happy either. <br />Saying that Radiohead should have stayed a \\"guitar-rock band\\" is the same as wishing that the Beatles should have stayed a \\"pop-rock band\\". When the White Album came out, people said they were too experimental and had lost their touch. Others, however, hailed them as geniuses. Any radical change leaves some behind.  <br />This is an album of confusion and sadness; obviously a phase the band was in. There are no excuses for what it is, it simply lays itself out there. If you take it for what it is, it's beautiful melodies and detached sadness couldn't be more perfect. Why try to change that?
B00005QW5X|5.0|The first time I watched this movie I bloody loved it, the music was grand, and the costumes were crazy as hell. I laughed my hed off while almost balling my eyes out. <br />A story of wanting to find a place to be and function in as well as trying to fing your other half, hellova thing to try to take on all at once. <br />Letting go of what you loved but could never have, letting go of the one that loved you so she could live her life. <br />Now I go to my friends house and do a double header of Rocky horror and Hedwig to sing along to. <br />Loved it to bits, such an exquisite corpse...
B0007CNXUK|5.0|One of the most beautiful movies I've seen.  A must see for those of you who love to get lost in the movies you watch.
B00061QK02|1.0|We rented this movie last night and I was so looking forward to seeing it - what a disappointment.  First let me start off by saying that I love Will Ferrell!!  He was hysterical on SNL, Old School and Elf.  However, this movie stunk...I mean REALLY STUNK!  How a movie could so waste the comedic talents of Will Ferrell is beyond me. The main problem with the movie is that it is NOT FUNNY!  I was expecting to be in stitches as I am with most Will Ferrell comedy pieces but I don't think we genuinely laughed one time.  The movie was boring and at times gross (as they desperatly try for laughs by stooping to toilet humor which is gross but not funny).  I also usually love Vince Vaughn in his smart ass side kick rolls (see Old School!).  However, in this movie his part is small and his part has none of the wise ass humor I love from him. <br /> <br />As much as it pains me to say this, save your money (don't rent this movie and sure as heck don't BUY it)because you will probably feel cheated.  I am looking forward to when \\"Bewitched\\" comes out and hopefully they will have done better by Will Ferrell!
B00008PBZW|5.0|maybe you don't like Nicolas Cage, maybe you don't like John Woo works! Let me start of myself! I have no sense to Nocolas cage, and hate John Woo and I think one of his masterpieses in ruining movies was the sequel to \\"Mission : Impossible\\" which many including me had high hopes for that!  But this movie is not a cheap, street fighting of action movie. It's a real epic and serious movie with excellent war secene of WWII in far east which I'd never seen any like them in any other movie! and it's really worth to buy cause it has many scenes that a War-Like person like me, can watch several times and enjoy! and, It's good to mention that, most of you people have never seen even a dead body, but I was in a real war and not a modern war, but a bloody old fashioned war just like WWII. my best friend bernt to die in front of me in a tank explosion. many of my comrades killed and turned into flesh pieces with mortars, grenades and enemy artillary. in some cases, we couldn't even collect their bodies or at least their metal plaques! I even have faught with enemy troops hand to hand and killed bunch of them with my knife! I spent 4 years of my life in the front and I can say that, all of the war scenes of this movie is real!
B00005JNEI|1.0|This movie is sheer propaganda and pure treason! Anybody that watches Fahrenheit 9/11 and actually believes that it is 100% true, needs professional help! Why does Michael Moore think that all democrats & liberals support him? I'm a democrat and I no longer support him. Yes, I used to be a big Michael Moore fan, but not anymore. It's a proven fact: there are 59 deceits in Fahrenheit 9/11. Don't believe me? Then go to this website and see for yourself:     (...)  I refuse to support a no-good arrogant propagandist like Michael Moore. The ratings for Fahrenheit 9/11 still continue to drop and that's a good thing, too! It's great to know that more and more people are waking up to the realisation that this film is sheer b.s. I encourage you to do your own research and learn to reason for yourself instead of simply letting other people do it for you. Stop letting people like Moore tell you things and just believing it. For a while I was making that same mistake, sucking up to Moore and his views instead of sucking up to truth & facts! Moore has always had a reputation for being manipulative and I've finally learned to accept that and move on. I will no longer be manipulated by this pompous a$$. I encourage you to read \\"Michael Moore is a Big Fat Stupid White Man.\\" You'll learn the truth about Michael Moore and hopefully accept it and move on with your life like I have. But if you still continue to support Moore and spend most of your precious ranting about Bush and politics, well all I can say is, more power to ya! As for me, I've got better things to do with my life. This is the only life I will ever have & I am not going to waste it on this crap. End of review.
B000957O7S|4.0|The grand irony of \\"Hitch\\" is that it talks the talk but in the end does not walk the walk.  The best part of this 2005 romantic comedy happen when the title character, Alex Hitchens (Will Smith), a.k.a. the \\"Date Doctor,\\" and his newest pupil, Albert Brennaman (Kevin James) are making an effort to impress the women with whom they are smitten.  Respectively, these ladies are Sara Melas (Eva Mendes), a smart but cynical gossip columnist for a New York City tabloid, and Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta), a glamorous celebrity socialite.  Nobody can get past the cold exterior that Sara has built around herself and everybody, especially the rest of the NYC celebrity set wants a piece of Allegra.<br /><br />Hitch decides he is interested in Sara and his opening gambits in getting her to respond are brilliant.  The script by Kevin Bisch provides a hook (at the bar) and a line (at her office) that set up a literal sinker (on the water).  More importantly, Will Smith could not be more comfortable playing a character.  Hitch is charming and he is smart, and despite a couple of problems with this first \\"date,\\" you have no trouble believing he is the \\"Date Doctor.\\"  Albert is an accountant and in great need of Hitch's coaching, even to the point of needing advice whispered in his ear while having a face to face conversation with the woman he adores (try doing THAT Cyrano de Bergerac).  But when Albert first manages to get Allegra's attention, and when he manages to get her to attend a function and has to run the gauntlet of her friends, he proves himself up to the task, and the important thing is that although Hitch has set up objectives (e.g., \\"shock and awe\\"), it is Albert who comes up with the specifics.  James's performance is almost as good as Smith's, but take into consideration that his role is harder, because he has to be both the timid accountant who needs all the help in the world and the guy who has his own charming side when he has the confidence to make it work for him.<br /><br />The problem with \\"Hitch\\" is that once director Andy Tennant has shown us that the Date Doctor is effective, both for his clients as well as in his own behalf, he decides that that he has come not to praise Hitch but to bury him.  I disagree with this diagnosis.  Hitch is not a smooth operator, which is a bad thing (a.k.a. being a pig), Hitch is just flat out smooth (I never thought I would say this, but Will Smith could be the closest thing we have to a new Cary Grant).  He is not scheming to seduce Sara, he is interested in her and capable of playing the high stakes came it takes to get her to actually take a guy seriously.  Likewise, Albert is not faking.  He has a better understanding of what it is he needs to do and why, and he makes an earnest attempt to do what needs to be done.  Neither one of them is lying when they say what they say and there is certainly nothing wrong with trying to put your best foot forward.  For that matter, knowing what that means in all of its myriad forms is not a bad thing either when you are trying to impress the woman you love.<br /><br />But when Hitch has his big moment of revelation and says what the script thinks is his big line, THAT is when the character tells his first lie.  Because what he says is simply not true and the proof for it is so simple: If Hitch had never talked to Albert how far would our accounting nebbish have gotten with Allegra?  For that matter, what in all honesty could Hitch have done to impress Sara given the dazzling display that we say it took from him to get her to agree to go out in the first place?  However, before the big dramatic ending ruins \\"Hitch\\" this is a pretty good romantic comedy with lots of smart and funny scenes, so there will be a lot of people willing to enjoy it and gloss over the hypocrisy of the final act, especially with all that cool dancing during the end credits.  But I have rarely seen a film whose self-proclaimed moral so badly missed the lesson it spent one hour and forty-five minutes developing.t one hour and forty-five minutes developing.
B0006L16N8|5.0|There's actually a nice mixture of songs on this CD: ballads, mid-tempos, grand overtures. It's the first Rock album I've heard that would actually qualify as soothing. Some are just too heavy-handed, but Coldplay is able to strike the perfect balance between hard and soft. They're good at combining Pop and Rock to the point where it becomes its own unique form. They avoid the fluff and cheese that so many others struggle with. If Martin weren't in a Rock band, he'd probably be a Pop vocalist because he has such a pleasant voice and it's a perfect match for their grander style. Everything sounds in perfect tune. The music never misses a beat. Amazingly, Martin's vocals are able to keep up with the melodies and not distract in any way. This album moves pretty quickly. I don't think there are any slow points really. But overall, a good album. <br /> <br />1. Square One 5/5 <br />2. What If 5/5 <br />3. White Shadows 5/5 <br />4. Fix You 4/5 <br />5.

B00005NW02|5.0|This album was my introduction to this band. I don't know what the one-star reviewers are thinking, but it's one of my favorite albums ever.  <br /> <br />He can sing! It's punk rock-esque so that's why he's sings so fast, which is really hard to do actually (try it). In addition, he (and the rest of the band) can switch the tempo of the song from really fast and punky to slow and dramatic, yet it still flows! This element of this band's music is what makes them unique and interesting to listen to.  <br />Their other albums such as Steal This Album! are faster, which is also fun and great, but I like how Toxicity incorporates more slow, melodic elements with the fast tempos, which creates a passionate, dramatic tone, which renders the songs gripping. I think this \\"gripping\\" tone makes this band stand apart from most popular bands whose lyrics and music are vapid and lack feeling and personality. This band takes major risks that most bands don't, and most of SOAD's experiments are successful. <br /> <br />By the way, many people say that many of this album's lyrics are \\"left of center\\". That's true, but they're are also surprisingly conservative elements as can be heard in \\"Aerials\\" and \\"Science\\" and even \\"Chop Suey!\\"
B00080ZG10|4.0|\\"The Aviator\\" is a good film that tries to be a whole lot better. Depicting the events in the life of Howard Hughes from 1927 (while producing the first multi-million dollar film in history, the WWI epic \\"Hell's Angels\\"), to 1947 (The first flight of the Hercules, also known as the Spruce Goose), director Martin Scorcese depicts Hughes as a genius of Aviation, while also showing his descent into madness (Hughes suffered from Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, which was unheard of in his day).<br /><br />With this film, Leonardo DiCaprio is finally showing that he can act for a change. He's still not on par with actors like Tom Hanks or Morgan Freeman, and his performance here is not as good as his last performance in Scorcese's \\"Gangs of New York,\\" but he does a good job nonetheless.<br /><br />Cate Blanchett is the real star of this picture. Her performance as Katherine Hepburn is dead on. She plays the icon of film with grace, and eccentricity. She deserved the oscar she won.<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale does a good job as Ava Gardener, and Gwen Stefani was surprisingly good as Jean Harlow in her brief scenes. The rest of the supporting cast (Including Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, and \\"Star Trek\\" veteran Brent Spiner) does a good job as well.<br /><br />The aerial sequences (including the filming of \\"Hell's Angels,\\" the crash of the XF-11 plane that nearly killed Hughes, and the first flight of the Spruce Goose) are outstanding, and the visual effects and cinematography are dazzling. Sadly, the problem with this film is that it spends too much time on Howard Hughes' affliction. An element of the story that at first is heart-breaking becomes annoying. The film also ends too abruptly, cutting off in the middle of a dramatic sequence that needed more to go on for the end of the movie, and the movie for that matter, to be meaningful.<br /><br />Despite these faults, \\"The Aviator\\" is an enjoyable epic that takes a fascinating look at the life of a man whose vision changed the course of aviation forever.<br /><br />The DVD features some good extras, but nothing to really praise. For those who are unsure, rent it first. But if you are a big fan of Scorcese's films, then \\"The Aviator\\" belongs in your DVD collection.<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: B+ever.  <br />The DVD features some good extras, but nothing to really praise.

0446677450|2.0|This is a an interesting read but do not pay a penny for it. This falls under the category of info-tainment, but does have valuable information if taken lightly. I would hate to think of all the people that failed trying his knuckle head antics. The failure rate I am sure is high, but who's real problem is that anyway!! <br /> <br />If indeed any of his quaint stories are factual, he is not a normal person, and probably exagerates his business success greatly prior to these books. I would probably be right making even stronger statements.  <br /> <br />It does not take a genious to make great real estate investments in a booming aloha land. Peopel line up in lotteries to bu 400K+ 1200 sq ft houses with out even knowing what lot they might get. <br /> <br />If you are brave enough to strike out on your own this book plays to the emotional aspects.
B0000640VO|5.0|I printed out Time's list of the 100 greatest movies of all time.  This wasn't on it.  But a co-worker said this was her favorite movie, so I checked it out.  It is better than every movie on the Time list, so far.  Aguirre - The Wrath of God is the only one so far that comes close, but I have quite a few to go.  I've only seen about 10 of them.<br /><br />What I love most about this movie is how sweet and affectionate the ending is.  I am just so tired of seeing passionate sexual kisses on screen.  The kisses here are tender, gentle, loving.<br /><br />Amelie herself is unforgettable and sweet.  There is a wonderful villain in the movie, a grocer, such an obnoxious guy, but fun to watch.  The actor must have had a ball playing him.<br /><br />I like the color in most of the movie.  It is bright and colorful.  I feel like it is painted with the vitality that would be appropriate for a small child's room, bursting with lively colors.<br /><br />There is such a funny, gentle, accepting, pleasant attitude towards sex.  In one scene we see couple after couple in the middle of it.  In another scene we see glasses on shelves, rocking to the beat of a couple having sex.  There is a sex shop, and it isn't ridiculed or made slimy.  It's played for innocent humor, as a female employee pastes price stickers on dildos and a man carelessly sticks them on a shelf - they make a hysterical visual impact.  Anyone who objects to the sex in this movie has a problem.<br /><br />I'm a very tough reviewer, and I usually give the classics, the icons, about 3 stars.  This movie kicks their tail.<br /><br />Amelie, the movie is over and I miss you.
6302185815|4.0|To be clear, \\"Episode One\\" of \\"Twin Peaks\\" is not the two-hour pilot movie but the first regular episode.  That is why \\"Episode One\\" is often listed as the second episode of \\"Twin Peaks,\\" with the \\"Pilot\\" movie being the first episode, unless you have a list that counts the \\"Pilot\\" movie as \\"Episode Zero.\\"  \\"Episode One\\" is also known as \\"Trace to Nowhere,\\" although that title does not come from the show's writers, but, from being shown in Germany.  So \\"Trace to Nowhere\\" is the English translation of \\"Spuren ins Nichts.\\"<br /><br />\\"Episode One\\" (Written by Mark Frost & David Lynch, Directed by Duwayne Dunham, First aired April 12, 1990) finds FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper enjoying the comforts of the Great Northern Hotel before finding out more about the secret life of Laura Palmer when Doctor Hayward releases her autopsy report.  Bobby Briggs and Mike Nelson are released from jail and are intent on taking vengeance on James Hurly.  Meanwhile, Big Ed Hurley figures out he was drugged at the Roadhouse, Catherine Martell reveals her plans to take over the Packard sawmill, and Doctor Jacoby is hiding information about Laura.  Cooper and Sheriff Truman interview Josie Packard, Donna Hayward and Aundrey Horne are determined to track down Laura's murder, and, most importantly, Sarah Palmer has a vision of a wild looking man.<br /><br />This is also the episode where Cooper has his first \\"damn fine cup of coffee\\" at the Double R Diner.  I was \\"there\\" last week (it is really Twede's Diner in Great Bend, Washington) and while I had the cherry pie I went with milk because I do not drink coffee (but my wife does, and did, in a mug proclaiming \\"Home of TWIN PEAKS Cherry Pie and 'A Damn Fine Cup of Coffee'.\\"  The episode is something of a let down after the pilot movie, which is to be expected given how compelling our introduction to \\"Twin Peaks\\" was in the first place.  In retrospect you can see that the episode is trying to get us interested in other mysteries besides \\"Who killed Laura Palmer?\\"  But what was just supposed to be the hook for the series overwhelmed everything else.  There is much more out there.  As Agent Cooper poses to Diane: \\"What really went on between Marlyin Monroe and the Kennedys? And who really pulled the trigger on JFK?\\"Who killed Laura Palmer?\\"   But what was just supposed to be the hook for the series overwhelmed everything else.  There is much more out there.

B000022TSH|5.0|This movie is masterfully done, has terrific acting, a great villain, a number of genuine surprises, and a stunning ending that haunts you.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson is the protagonist.  Faye Dunaway is the leading lady.  The odd thing is, my favorite actor here is John Huston, the villain, who doesn't get nearly as much screen time as the other two.  He is perfectly believable in a very eerie role.  He is charming, menacing, and nuts, all at the same time.<br /><br />This movie benefited greatly by having a non-American director, Roman Polanski.  America, this one time, is shown to be a land where wealth rules, where the good guys completely lose, the innocent are victimized, and the cops aren't getting anything right.  It is a mirror of ourselves that only a non-American would have given us.<br /><br />I would say a lot more, but I realize that some of you who are browsing this site haven't seen the movie yet, and it would be a crime to reveal too much.  This is an extremely intelligent film with some hard hitting surprises.<br /><br />It does not focus on Chinatown.  Chinatown is just mentioned as a place where some of the characters used to work, a place ruled by organized crime, where the best thing for the cops to do was as little as possible, because they never knew whether they were being used to solve a problem for the innocent or being used as pawns by the guilty, to add the weight of law to the weight of extortion.<br /><br />I know exactly how that is, how police can be used in America to further the goals of the guilty parties.  Chinatown, in this movie, is a symbol of lawlessness and disorder, and the movie is telling us that all of America is like that, that we live in Chinatown ourselves, that there is no law here.  Sometimes it does go that way.<br /><br />I've never seen an ending as menacing as the ending in this movie.  Actually, do you remember in Saturday Nite Live when they did the \\"Bill\\" skits, where the victim kept saying \\"Oh noooooooooo.....\\".  Hey, when things get this bad, it helps to laugh.oooooooooo.....\\".  Hey, when things get this bad, it helps to laugh.
0345456343|5.0|to be honest i have read all of annes published works dealing with both the vampires and the mayfair witches and i believe these three books (interview, lestat, and queen of the damned)were what made me keep my interest in them for as long as i have.  it is her way of story telling which ensnares the imagination in us all. to be completely honest if you are going to read these three be prepared to be spending more money in a few months to buy the rest of the set.  <br /> <br />sort of in response to a review posted prior.  without getting into much detail it is expanded more on in her other books but the gist of it is that while akasha was undoubtedly the oldest and first of all vampires they centuries of her slumber made her weaker than mekhare (i believe that is the correct spelling and if not i dont have time to fix it).  it is explained out that the longer a vampire stays awake and feeding the faster and greater their powers grow to be.  in any event it is a work of fiction one doesnt need to over analyze it to enjoy the book for what it is.
B00005JNJT|5.0|And I don't mean The Force, but that would make for one heck of a movie. <br /> <br />I'm gonna assume that most of you have seen all of the previous four Batman films.  There are the bad/terrible, you get to choose, films directed by Joel Shumacher.  In these movies the bad guys are covered in neon colors and are busy ice skating around Batman while they are trying to fight him.  Everything is colorfull and Batman even whips out a Bat-credit card.  UGHHHH!  Then there are the good/great Batman films, once again you get to choose.  These films are dark and very intense.  Batman is played by a person who understands what Bruce Wayne's character is about, meaning how tormented he is by his parent's death and how he wants to bring justice to Gotham City.  Oh yeah, these films are directed by Tim Burton who seems like the person that Batman movies were meant to directed by.  These movies are the example that \\"Batman Begins\\" followed.  In this movie Batman/Bruce Wayne returns to his dark roots. <br /> <br />This film basically explores Bruce Wayne's past.  It goes into great detail of what happened to him after to his parent's murder.  It explains how he became a fearful, revenge-minded person that sought training to prevent criminals from flourishing in Gotham City.  It goes into how he came to decide on becoming Batman.  How he got his utility belt, his costume and the Batmobile.  There's also a story of him saving Gotham City from nerve gas that makes you go permantly crazy, but thats not were the main story lies.  Its kind of a side show.   <br /> <br />First of all, any fan of Batman should thank Christopher Nolan if you aver meet him.  As mentioned earlier, he has made Batman a dark super hero once again.  One of the great things that he created an image of was the fear that bad guys had of Batman.  In this film, Batman would pop out a dark spot and snatch a bad guy, just like in the comic books.  The bad guys were really scared of the Dark Knight, which is how itshould be.  Christian Bale did a great job as Batman/Bruce Wayne.  He played the most intense and darkest Batman to date.  His Batman voice was a little too scruffy, but nothing else was bothersome.  The rest of the supporting cast, which included Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, and Katie Holmes, did a good job also.  Not too much to complain about with the flick. <br /> <br />I would have to say that this film is definitely a challenger for the best of the series.  This movie is so far the movie to see this summer.  Definitely check this film out.  There's no way that you'll be disappointed.

B00008MNYS|5.0|Rob's voice has finally come of age in this collection of songs. He is a delight to listen to as an alternative to all the scatchy voiced male alternative rock/pop singers. His voice is liquid gold and Americans should start to get him now! A good recommendation if you love his voice, is his \\"Swing when you're Winning\\" CD. He is not the most handsome man (despite what the song says!) but has charisma and stage presence, coupled with his voice that make him a very sexy entertainer. I am one American woman in Los Angeles who WILL travel to whatever state in the US he finally decides to do a concert in, and probably sit front row! And I will drag all my girlfriends who I have turned on to Rob too. Just name the state!
B0009A1AS2|3.0|I've been a fan of DT since I first heard Pull Me Under on the radio late one night long ago. Images and Words was a great sophomore release with some stellar playing. Awake had this in spades. Falling Into Infinity was lost on me somewhat but it's still OK. Scenes From A Memory was a stroke of genius. Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence was simply amazing. Train Of Thought is (IMO) their best album to date. So now we come to Octavarium, the latest from the musical mammoths. Having listened to it three times today I can honestly say that I like it, but I'm not blown away by it. There are very few Holy S*$T moments where you have to replay something because you can't beleive what you've just heard. Anybody who was expecting another Awake or Train Of Thought will be somewhat disappointed. Having said this, this album still rocks. The Root of All Evil is an economical rocker that continues Mike Portnoy's musical epic from the previous two records. Panic Attack is a juggernaut of a tune, probably has the fastest playing the band has demonstrated. Sacrificed Sons is an epic tune about 9/11. The masterpiece of the CD is Octavarium, the 24 minute title track. This has a bit of everything- Pink Floyd style intro, Genesis style 12 string guitar, mini-moog solos, clever lyrics that reference The Beatles, Van Halen, Yes, Genesis, Queen, ELP and many other inspirations the band has, as well as an orchestra. Overall, this record stands up well on its own, but die-hards shouldn't try to compare it to other releases by DT. That's like assuming that Yes will record another Close To The Edge or Genesis will record another Foxtrot. The band has proven that they can play and now they seem content to expand to record more melodic music but still retain a hint of what they were before. CAn't wait to see what's next.
B0007VZ9DK|5.0|I loathe the inevitable comparisons made between \\"Casino\\" and \\"Goodfellas\\".  The films do share a director, Martin Scorsese, a source writer, Nicholas Pileggi, and two stars, Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci.  That's where the similarities end.  Both films tackle stories in the criminal milieu and succeed in gripping the audience.  Scorsese manages to make this film a fast-paced experience despite a nearly three hour running time.  He's ably abetted by some snappy editing by Thelma Schoonmaker, gorgeous cinematography by Robert Richardson, and good sense of the era(love the cars and clothes).  Impeccable song choices on Scorsese's part on the soundtrack.  The film is fascinating in how it portrays Las Vegas as a shimmering city which under it's surface is motivated by greed and avarice, which in turn breeds paranoia.  Just ask the eye in the sky.  The first half of the film concerns itself with how some Midwest mobsters infiltrate a Vegas casino.  The second half shows how overreaching causes their downfall.  DeNiro is superb as the oddsmaker who goes on to manage a casino only to be brought down by his own vanity.  Pesci is equally fine as the thug who wants to make Vegas his personal playground.  Probably the best performance in the film belongs to Sharon Stone as DeNiro's wife who is at heart a hustler.  This is a difficult part to pull off because her's is essentially a character motivated by pure greed but Stone manages to convey the pathos to make her sympathetic.  I think Scorsese is a victim of his own success because this film was initially given lukewarm response from the critics and public alike.  Fortunately, time has been kind to \\"Casino\\".
B0007TKNII|3.0|I just finished watching this film which declares itself to be \\"a breathtaking feature-film\\".  Feature-film it may be, but it is far from breathtaking.   <br /> <br />The film does have it's finer moments, such as the lavish costumes and dazzling sets.  Before viewing the film, I had thought The Phantom of the Opera a musical restricted to the stage.  Although I still prefer this musical live to the film version, The Phantom made the jump from stage musical to movie very admirably, in my opinion.  At times, the movie is able to enhance techniques used in the theater, like the transition from the auction to the opera house as it used to be and the change during the song \\"Think of Me\\". <br /> <br />However, the film has some rough spots.  I was most disappointed by the leads.  One would think that, for the casting of a musical, the filmmaker would look first for a voice strong enough to carry the role, then determine the singer whose loooks are right for the part.  And yet, the casting of the main characters seems to have been made in an opposite manner.  Gerard Butler shows little to no feeling and, while Emmy Rossum is very pretty and has a lovely voice, she spends most of the film with an expression of surprise (or is it awe?) on her face and her mouth open.  There are also times when her voice is too weak to handle the demands of Christine Daae.  Patrick Wilson was nice as Raoul, but only that.  Perhaps Raoul would have been better portrayed with more passion, emotion, and strength. <br /> <br />I was also quite disappointed by the Masquerade number.  Even taking into consideration that this was the film and not the stage version, perhaps the director would have done well to follow the lead of the stage production.  Rather than creating a dizzying display of colors and costumes (which the lyrics of the song describe), the costumes are conservative and quite dull.  Even the choreography doesn't manage to salvage what should be a very spectacular song. <br /> <br />All in all, the film was nicely made.  I enjoyed watching it, but there were times when I felt that it was lacking.  In all honesty, I wish I could give this film 3 and a half stars.  It was a nice film, but, with stronger acting and singing, it could have been absolutely breathtaking.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|If we want to make a serious review, we need to know a little bit of music and of course listen to the album. The Beatles was and is the best band EVER, and their music change our WORLD. This is an album full of historical recording from the sixties and the quality of the music is amazing. A must if you like music. Why not to purchase an album that has some of the best songs ever? Really man, if you don't have this album, you don't really like good music.
B00097A5HW|5.0|I am no music expert, but I am a Shakira fan.  Anyway here's my opinion for what it's worth.  I understand Shakira had written 60 songs, certainly a big enough number to cover two albums, one in Spanish and one in English.  I found it a bit disappointing therefore to find that out of twelve tracks, two of the songs are repeated, (`La Pared' & `La Tortura') albeit in different forms, reducing this collection to ten original songs.     I have seen one critic criticise Shakira for being too `eclectic' and for not settling down to one style or for not finding `her own' style.  I see it a bit differently though. I think the variety on this album shows her versatility and musical talent.    The styles chosen could also been seen in another `light', i.e. as a clever piece of marketing.  The inclusion of Alejandro Sanz could be a way of appealing to her Spanish fans, the Bossa Nova touch of `Obtener Un S' as way of appealing to her Brazilian fans, the French start to 'En Tus Pupilas' as a way of appealing to her Francophone fans and the German start to `Lo Impescindible' as a way of appealing to her German speaking fans, etc.     This production seems to be very 'studio based' and I think it will require some adaptation if she is to do a tour.  I agree with the comment about the lack of 'danceable' upbeat songs.    Whilst I might sound overcritical and a touch cynical, I am nonetheless a Shakira fan and find her music spellbinding.  My personal favourite is `Las de la Intuicin'.  (I bought the CD to listen to Shakira, not Alejandro Sanz). Listening to this is for me the musical equivalent of travelling through several landscapes.  I just marvel at her talent.  The fact that her CD already holds the number one slot in so many countries (June 2005), speaks for itself.    I am very pleased to see that Shakira will be participating in the 'Live 8 Concert' organized by Bob Geldof (at the 'Palais de Versailles') in Paris on 2nd of July, by the way.    Just to digress slightly,I could not help but wonder whether Shakira's holding a baby on the CD's cover picture, carries a (not so subtle?) subliminal message.
B0007XT87G|5.0|It has been two and a half years since Porcupine Tree's last album, In Absentia and the follow-up is Deadwing. Porcupine Tree is a London-based band that somewhat fits into the progressive rock genre. As their ninth studio album, Porcupine Tree has chosen to release a semi-conceptual record loosely based around ideas generated from a ghost film screen play. Slated for a European release date of March 28 and April 26 for America, Deadwing is going to please the Porcupine Tree fans and should create a wealth of new followers! <br /> <br />There was a lot of speculation as to what direction Steven Wilson, front man of Porcupine Tree, was going to take this album; especially after the release of the first single and radio song taken from Deadwing titled \\"Shallow\\". Shallow has received lots of airplay in the US and to be honest scared me when I heard it. Steven Wilson described \\"Shallow\\" as, \\"a big dumb rock song, done the Porcupine Tree way.\\" With a commercial and radio friendly song released a few weeks before the album, I was hoping that Porcupine Tree wasn't about to release a more marketable rock album. Well, you can rest assured that my fears and worries were so far off it wasn't even funny. Deadwing is chock full of great songs, save for it falls on the different side of standard Porcupine Tree releases yet it still hits the mark as another phenomenal release from the band. <br /> <br />Deadwing starts off with the title track, \\"Deadwing\\". Just shy of ten minutes, \\"Deadwing\\" is the perfect way to begin the voyage into the new album. Starting off with an electronic intro that hardly builds up the beginning riff that jump starts your adrenaline. This song is absolutely brilliant and holds some of the best vocal melodies of the album. \\"Deadwing\\" definitely fits in the Porcupine Tree catalog of epic songs and doesn't feature the standard structure of: verse, chorus, verse, etc. that most other bands compose. In fact, the song doesn't even feature a chorus! Ending in eerie noises, \\"Deadwing\\" progresses right into the first single off of the album, \\"Shallow\\". <br /> <br />\\"Shallow\\" is definitely the most radio friendly song on the album as I previously mentioned. Reminding me in a way of \\"Blackest Eyes\\" from In Absentia in regards to song construction, \\"Shallow\\" starts off with a heavy guitar riff which the verses are sung over transitioning into a melodic pre-chorus before the heart-stomping chorus. \\"Shallow\\" is an ordinary song in terms of current releases, yet it is a different song for Porcupine Tree even though it does have a good rock-vibe and is very likable. I'm sure a lot of fans are going to debate this song, but I like it none the less. <br /> <br />Are you a fan of Steven Wilson's Blackfield side project? If so, you are going to love \\"Lazarus\\". If not, you are still going to love \\"Lazarus\\"! As the third song on the album, \\"Lazarus\\" is a magnificent and beautiful ballad that would have fit the Blackfield release. I absolutely adore this song and hope to hear similar tracks like this in the future from the band. Whether you are a fan of Porcupine Tree or not, \\"Lazarus\\" is likable on so many different levels. Listen to it and decide for yourself. Regardless, \\"Lazarus\\" kicks ass! <br /> <br />Speaking of kicking ass, get ready to tap your feet because \\"Halo\\" in my opinion is the catchiest song on Deadwing. \\"Halo\\" begins with a captivating bass line that caught me off guard. Every now and again a band can compose a song that just grabs your full attention and won't let you go until the song ends, and Porcupine Tree accomplished just that with \\"Halo\\". This is definitely not your stock rock song, which is what makes this song so much fun to listen to. <br /> <br />I have read a lot of posts on forums and other reviews for Deadwing simply describing the fifth track as the song to buy the album for. \\"Arriving Somewhere, But Not Here\\" is an amazing song, and this is the reason to buy the album.\\" Personally, I really like how this track progresses along through its twelve minute journey. Porcupine Tree covered almost everything within this song from a heavy section smack-dab in the middle to the light guitar riffs that begins the song right through the soft percussion leading into guitar solos and lead riffs at the end of the track. To say the least, I really like \\"Arriving Somewhere, But Not Here\\", although I think it is a bit overrated compared to what others are saying. <br /> <br />\\"Mellotron Scratch\\" and the ninth track \\"Glass Arm Shattering\\" are the two mellow tracks on the album. Either one of these songs could have showed up on the last three or four Porcupine Tree albums and fit the record. Both songs are good, not phenomenal, but good. I really don't have a lot to say about either one, except that \\"Mellotron Scratch\\" has my favorite outros on the disc.  <br /> <br />From what I have gathered, I'm going to take a lot of crap for saying, \\"My favorite song on Deadwing is `Open Car'.\\" This song has the best vibe between the opening guitar and the fanatical vocal melody that is played over it. My favorite line on the album comes from this song as well when Steven Wilson sings, \\"Being with you is hell.\\" It is few and far between when I like the shortest song on the album, but \\"Open Car\\" is simply stated, \\"awesome\\", and has a transition right into \\"The Start of Something Beautiful\\" virtually making them one song. \\"The Start of Something Beautiful\\" is my second favorite song on the album and could have easily been dropped right on Opeth's \\"Damnation\\". There is a perfect connection between Colin Edwin, the bassist, and Gavin Harrison on drums and is reminiscent of the \\"Martin to Martin\\" connection between the bassist and drummer on the Opeth Damnation album. Another good selling point of this song is the instrumental section \\"starting\\" around 4:45 that is just amazing and \\"beautiful\\". No pun intended, of course! Anyways, if I was to give a reason or recommendation to buy Deadwing, it wouldbe for \\"Open Car\\" and \\"The Start of Something Beautiful\\", because these songs are nothing shy of amazing. <br /> <br />It took me a few times listening through Deadwing to realize that I absolutely love the album, and probably is my favorite release to date in 2005. At the moment this disc is my favorite Porcupine Tree album and is just as brilliant as Stupid Dream and In Absentia. Now to the part of the review that I give you a whole bunch of reasons to get a copy of Deadwing! Actually, why even bother? If you have read this much you probably are familiar with the band and don't need any reasons other than the fact that it is the newest addition to the Porcupine Tree catalog! If you haven't heard the band before, well give them a chance and give Deadwing a listen to. I think most people are going to like this album. <br />
B0009A1AS2|1.0|Long, meandering, boring...again.  These guys separately are amazing musicians, however they cannot construct a great song anymore. Sorry to all who have a problem with comparing their entire catalog to their benchmark release (Images and Words)... but it's human nature, and they simply seem uninspired ever since.  After listening to this several times, track two and the last one are standouts, but not for sonic greatness.  The former is a lesson in faux light-rock cheese, and the latter another 300 minute showcase of \\"hey-Ma-look-at-me\\" tomfoolery which Kansas and even early Genesis pull off to greater effect.  I don't get it, but apparently many do.  In an effort to help the next 400-500 posters on this particular album, if you crave smart, heavy, catchy, melodic rock/metal, pick up Kamelot's: The Black Halo.  No, I'm not a member of the band, I'm just passing on to my fellow brethren what I feel is a severely underrated release that could be compared to early Dream Theater...like when they were hungry and songwriting mattered.
B00005JNJT|3.0|After hearing the director on NPR describe the psychological complexity of the character and how the first third of the film was devoted to developing that complexity, I was eager to see Batman Begins. Indeed, Christian Bale was excellent and so was Michael Caine, two very witty, sympathetic characters. But the love story with Rachel the DA played by Katie Holmes is flaccid and wastes a lot of the film. The \\"face your fear\\" lectures made my eyes roll more than a few times.<br /><br />Most of all, the style was all over the place. At times realistic; other times hyperreal in the best sense like the masterpiece film Sin City, Batman Begins ultimately was a pastiche of cliches and empty chase scenes.<br /><br />Part of the problem is that a few months earlier the film Sin City raised the bar on highly stylized comic films and sadly Batman Begins is several notches below Sin City.
B00097DX3U|5.0|I had never even heard of Audioslave when I caught their first single off this album Be Yourself on a local radiosation. Instantly I was hooked, it's rock without all the mainstream popish sound and minus the annoying screaming some vocalist throw in just to sound hard. I think Chris Cornell is honestly one of the best vocalists out there now. And the fact that you have 3/4 of RATM backing him with purely awesome music, puts Audioslave in a class all their own. I had all but given up on rock after the 90s like most because all anyone was listening to was crappy mainstream punk acts who think because they knew how to play a guitar that they should. I don't want to put down other great bands that have released quality music in the 2000s, but with MTVs ability to only show 50 cent and Britney Spears I figured all bets where off and I would have to resort to listening to only past music. Thankfully Audioslave was as refreshing a change to my CD player as any band I have listened to in the last 10 years. So Rock ON and thanks for saving me from all the crap people listen to these days.
B00025ETIW|5.0|I thought this cd was really weird and gothic thing it was the first punk/emo/rock type cd I had ever bought, but I quickly learned to love it. I like all the songs except for \\"Helena\\" the bands second single just because I've heard it so many times. The best song has to be \\"You know what they do to guys like us in prison\\" featuring Bert McCracken (the used) it has great lyrics and a driving meleody. The best thing about this cd is it has guitar solos in every song which not a lot of bands today are doing. I definitley reccomend this cd to anyone who even listens to music. And to music fan \\"manpmn87\\" you are an idiot for rating the cd after only hearing on song off of it(Helena) and you still gave it two stars for one song. What else can I say that guys an idiot. Get this cd!

0060926317|5.0|Ms. Morgan's book was short, but powerful. The controversy surrounding it focuses on wheather the incidents described within were true or not, and whether Ms. Morgan described the Aboriginal culture correctly or not. Sadly, people who belittle this book on either of these points it utterly and completely missing the point! This focus on wheather the book is fact or fiction also draws teh focus away from the important message of the book.  Ms. Morgan could have witten a Sci-Fi book taking place on another planet, included the same message, and it would have been equally as important! Books such as Daniel Quinn's \\"Ishmael\\" or anything by Don Miguel Ruiz, and countless other books, contain the same message--having humanity wake up to the fact that in our present form we're killing the world around us as we loose our spiritual connection to it. \\"Mutant Message Down Under\\" can be true or false, and i could care less. Ms. Morgan's message within is the only pertinent aspect of it, and she puts it accross simply and powerfully. If this books gets even one person thinking, then it was worth the publication.
B00097A5I6|1.0|Boring, dull and lifeless, basically its Oasis's version of 1960s rock n roll which has been and gone and has its place, but we need good modern music not rehashed crap. <br /> <br />What a dissaponitment, their was'nt an actual bad Oasis album yet until \\"don't beleive the truth\\", it sounds nothing like the proper Oasis that everyone has come to know and love and is by no means a neccessary album to have in youe collection. <br />A total waste of time and money.
1559408898|5.0|Robocop is truly an amazing film that walks a tight rope. In my opinion the director masterfully walks it for although it  is filled with blood and gore it is done so successfully he makes artistic decisions that at times turn bad taste into cinematic high art.    Filled with social and political commentary and a parody of science fiction, cop movies, old westerns, consumerism, American culture and television it  presents a believable hero who we care about. It is also about a man's search for himself.    Although it is a very violent film I can think of  films that are worse that have been accepted in being mainstream and the buckets o'blood approach is more like that seen in a comic book.    The film opens, and continues through out the length of the picture, to be punctuated by a news program, commercials and a comedy show that stars a lecherous old man (\\"I'd buy that for a dollar!\\"). It gives us a good introduction to this world of the future and  the movie's odd  dark humor. It is now also strangely as we look back on it a time capsule of the 80s as it  does a great job of portraying corporate America of that period.    The movie is  thrill  ride, incredibly funny and a morality tale.   Somehow the director pulls off all of them simultaneously and with ease. Like a great artist he knows when not to take himself so seriously and when to highlight the human drama. And yet despite the movie being in my opinion quite deep it is a very very funny movie.    Set  some time in the near future in Detroit we see a struggling police department trying to deal with a city that is rotting from the inside out.    A corporation (Omni Consumer Products or OCP for short) has  been given the job of rebuilding  Detroit as well as overseeing the police department. The corporation is portrayed as monolithic and its executives are portrayed as a bunch of  kiss-ups who would go so far as  to kill each other to climb another rung of the ladder.    Transferred from a relatively respectable  neighborhood to the worst neighborhood in Detroit officer Frank Murphy (played by Peter Weller) at first comes across to the rest of the officers as being green. Officer Murphy though is a brave man , too brave for his own good.      Meanwhile OCP in its quest for taming old Detroit has developed a new product for \\"urban pacification\\" a robot called ED209. ED209 in my opinion is the most frightening part of the movie - more so than even the oceans of blood spilled. It is not so much what ED209 is capable of doing but its very appearance, The robot  has the stature of a samurai on steroids with legs  and arms more oversized than the drumsticks on a Purdue chicken and moves  in its jerky robotic way  like a dinosaur. Probably  the most horrific scene in the movie is when the prototype  for ED209  goes haywire during a demonstration for the chairman of the board and an executive is killed (even in this scene the director never stops the laughs  as after an employee is sprayed in a barrage of bullets that seems to last forever the chairman of the board turns to the head of the project and tells him he is \\"very disappointed\\" and goes on as how this  set back will cost the company millions while the rest of the executives in the background are  paniced frightened and hysterical. An underling  has a contingency plan \\"The Robocop Program\\" that would transform  police officers who have been killed in the line of duty into cyborgs. So the Robocop plan is now set into action waiting for its first..er...volunteer.    As it so happens  Frank Murphy and his partner  after hot pursuit of Clarence Bodiker (the crime boss of Detroit) and his gang trap them in an abandoned warehouse. And Frank nearly succeeds in catching his prey but unfortunately the tables are turned and Frank is killed.    He is air ambulanced out and rushed into surgery where he is brutally  given a \\"total  body prosthesis\\" which spares just his face and  part of his brain and replaces the rest of his body with a robot like form.    At first Robocop is a success but unfortunately for its creator the man-machine  still has maintained a human side under all of its gruffness. Although the cyborg has no idea of its origins  it has retained the integrity of officer Murphy and  the same dedication to the truth and so in tracking down the bad guys it comes to learn of his past and this jogs some of his memories.    Throughout the movie  the director keeps up the balance of gore, sight gags and uproarious one liners. (An example of this is when an executive in the executive washroom is poking  fun at his boss not knowing he is in one of the stalls. The rest of the executives clear out so fast (like a pack of Keystone Cops) that one of them as he leaves  the urinal wets his pants.)    Unbeknownst to the police department or OCPs chairman  Robocops creator has a business relationship with Clarence Bodiker and Murphy learns this.  Murphy as Robocop goes after the high-ranking  officer of OCP which in turn causes both the police force and OCP to go after the man-machine.    Several of the scenes in this movie are quite reminiscent of show downs in westerns like \\"High Noon\\".     Who is Frank Murphy? He is a piece of a man who has more integrity than most men that are whole and intact. Though a robot his devotion and integrity  go beyond his programming. Some might see him as a \\"Christ symbol\\". Certainly  the man-machine  stands out as the most human thing left in a world gone mad. Is Robocop a man , a machine (at  at least once in the film he is refered to as 'OCP property') or both? That is one struggle that goes on in the movie. In the end we see Robocop is very much human and that Frank Murphy will always be Frank Murphy.    Some might have  to hold their hands over their eyes when they first see some of the scenes of this movie but I guarantee  that many will want to watch it again and again. The director's incredible attention to detail will have you picking up wonderful little touches you will have missed during the first viewing.    An incredible make over of the hero in an age that no longer believes in heroes.    This is a movie I never tire of.      Highly recommended    \\"Hallstatt Prince\\"
B0009HLDFU|1.0|No one will be listening to this in 20 years!!!! <br />But their first two still will be.
B000002O5L|5.0|Tom Petty's first solo album is a masterpiece. With the legendary Jeff Lynne providing the essentials on and behind the record and Tom singing his heart out and in conjunction with Mr Lynne writing some fantastic guitar tunes. You get a real sense of passion from playing this album and it certainly has the looseness and feel of the Traveling Wilbury's Vol 1, another Jeff Lynne production. <br />There's a real variety of musical styles featured here, so much so that you can't really pin it down to any particular era or sound. The thing which is constant is the great production, the great showmanship and musicianship along withthe great hooks in the tunes which intrigue the listener and make him look for more. <br />Every track on this album is a gem from Free Fallin, I Won't Back Down to Face In The Crowd, Runnin Down A Dream or the bopping Zombie Zoo you won't be disappointed. Essential listening.

0321334876|1.0|This book and its predecessor including his 'More Effective C++ 35 More Ways To Improvre Your Programs' are overrated. If you have read Bjarne Stroustrup's C++ Programming Language 3rd Special Edition Hardcover and/or Stanley Lippman's C++ Primer 3rd Edition and/or his latest 4th Edition, which is not as good and detailed as his 3rd Edition, this book of Meyers presents nothing new that you would have already known by the time you have read Stroustrup and/or Lippman first.<br /><br />If you want to read a thoroughly detailed book on ANSI/ISO Standard C++ that make you really think about the granularities of the language and its subtleties, then I would read the more practical 'Essential C++ and More Essential C++' Series of books by a much smarter programmer in Herb Sutter. His items are more thorough and each of his items is dedicated to a whole chapter. I would also catch his latest and greated book, 'Exceptinal C++ Style'. Herb Sutter's book series far exceeds Meyers book in detail and overall quality. It is a no contest.<br /><br />Meyers has always capitalized on simply telling you what you should already know assuming you had read a more thorough text like Stroustrup's and/or Lippman's.<br /><br />I have never been a fan of shallow topical based books like this one written by Meyers.

Again, this book is also topical, but must be read after the definitive text on the C++ Standard Library, Nicolai Josuttis's book, 'C++ Standard Library: A Tutorial and Reference'.<br /><br />I am giving this book 1 star, because most intelligent programmers can certainly do without it, since nothing in this book, besides a sneek at the C++ TR1 extensions, is new.<br /><br />This is just additional fluff that will hog your book shelf.k, besides a sneek at the C++ TR1 extensions, is new.  <br /> <br />This is just additional fluff that will hog your book shelf.

B000003EUL|5.0|The editorial review here by David Hurwitz is in error when he states that Richter \\"was one of those virtuoso egomaniac genius types who was so insecure that he practiced something like 10 hours a day.\\"  Anyone who has seen the fascinating film \\"Richter the Enigma\\" knows that, by his own admission, Richter generally practiced 2-3 hours a day and even used a stopwatch to keep track.  Richter did admit to a few exceptions, such as when he had to practice 12 hours daily just before his premiere of the Prokofiev 7th Piano Sonata (in order to quickly learn and master that extremely diificult piece).  Perhaps that film's major revelation was just how amazingly modest and humble Richter was as both a man and a musician.<br /><br />At least Hurwitz likes these performances, and we are thus spared one of the nasty & vituperative reviews that he writes frequently for classicstoday.  There he called Barbirolli's Mahler 2nd the work of \\"a slob,\\" and concluded a review of a Barbirolli BBC Legends CD with \\"I'm flushing this one down the Glorious John.\\"  Not to mention his callow analogy to a sexual encounter from an episode of \\"Sex and the City\\" in his negative review of Boult's Rachmaninov 3rd Symphony.  Frankly, I didn't care for those recordings either, but such mean-spirited and tasteless notices do nothing but compromise Hurwitz's reputation as a \\"professional\\" music critic.  And that's a shame, because many of his reviews are perceptive and highly insightful.<br /><br />At any rate, this extremely well-transferred CD captures two of Richter's finest studio performances.  The Brahms 2nd Piano Concerto is beautifully played, and the often unsympathetic Leinsdorf is here a wonderful partner.  The Beethoven \\"Appassionata\\" was one of my earliest Richter recordings (on a budget Victola LP) and, while many of its details are rather mannered, I continue to be astonished by the tumultous, breathtaking virtuosity of the last mvt.<br /><br />Alternatives?  Richter also left a remarkable \\"live\\" Brahms 2nd with Georges Georgescu and a Bucharest ensemble that is even more spontaneous and poetic, if not as well played.  That is on a Doremi CD, which also contains Richter's ONLY available recording of the Brahms Handel Variations.  My other two favorite studio versions of the concerto are the Curzon/Knappertsbusch (a Decca LP that is now available on a Living Stage CD set) and the Backhaus/Schuricht (Decca).  Just for the conducting, the older versions by Max Fiedler and Furtwangler are gorgeous, but the pianists (Elly Ney and Edwin Fischer, respectively) hit an awful lot of wrong notes.<br /><br />There is also a superb Richter \\"live\\" Appassionata on Melodiya, coupled with 8 Bagatelles, the Pathetique, and the Fantasy for Piano, Chorus & Orchestra conducted by Sanderling (see my review).  Other great Appassionatas include those by Rubinstein (RCA), Yves Nat (EMI) and Ernst Levy (Marston).<br /><br />But for a combination of great playing AND great sound, this Richter CD is an essential purchase. Update 12/14/12: Prompted by a recent comment from Robert Mueller (see below), I have re-visited various recordings of the Brahms Second Piano Concerto and now find that my preferences have shifted a bit in the 7+ years since posting this Amazon review. Mueller expresses delight in recently hearing the manic live 1943 Aeschbacher/Furtwangler (which I have on a deleted Tahra CD), which displays far greater passion and digital accuracy than what's heard in Furtwangler's live 1942 account with another Swiss pianist (Edwin Fischer, in an M&A set). Unfortunately, I feel that the recorded sound in both of those is pretty dreadful (Aeschbacher also recorded the work in 1952 with Paul van Kempen - in a different Tahra CD set - but the sound is so plagued by pitch fluctuations that I ended up weeding that entire set). To my ears, this work is essentially lyrical and \\"autumnal\\" in feeling and thereby requires decent sound to be fully enjoyed. My current preference isthe studio 1950s Curzon/Knappertsbusch with the Vienna Philharmonic in excellent sound on Decca.<br /><br />Jeff Lipscomb
0312117337|5.0|I have been reading Tarot cards for about 20 years now, and working with the Osho Zen Tarot for about 9 of those. I was inspired to write my review when my old deck required replacing. I wore it out!<br /><br />Whether you are a reader or a collector, this deck is a \\"must have.\\" The artwork is STUNNING! I'm a big fan of color, and decks don't get much more colorful than this. I often study the illustrations the way I study paintings in a museum. There is always more to see, more to understand, than what first catches the eye. There is even something profound about the blank, black No-thingness card. Stare at that for a while, and you might suddenly find yourself having a vision of the Big Bang! Before there was everything... there was No-thing. These cards trigger personal revelations for both the reader and the person being read.<br /><br />I find this deck to be a fascinating and refreshing \\"change up\\" from traditional Tarot decks. The Osho Zen is loosely based on traditional Tarot, but I find it most effective when doing self readings or reading for others who have \\"inner issues\\". It is an excellent divinitation tool when it comes to \\"inner issues\\" related to exploring spirituality, overcoming emotional/mental/spiritual blockages and obstacles, managing grief and/or chaos, understanding why one is stuck in a rut, etc., rather than readings involving external forces (job, money, relationship, relocation, etc.). Really great for people trapped in self-destructive cycles! This deck can provide a gentle but well-placed kick in the butt that inspires change and encourages progress.<br /><br />The Osho Zen Tarot is also extremely useful for introspection and meditation. From the simple ritual of choosing a card in the morning for a \\"thought of the day\\" to doing a full spread when you feel out of sorts, the beauty and wisdom contained in this deck are a special magic all their own.

B000002J03|5.0|When ranking the best Zep albums of all time, ZoSo,LZ I, and Physical Graffiti are always right at the top. But I think an album that is seriously overlooked as a classic rock/hard rock/metal classic is Led Zeppelin II. Page is at his absolute best on this album, scoring awesome riffs on just about every track here. The first track, \\"Whole Lotta Love\\", is a classic with a simple yet addicting riff from Mr. Page (and some funky tornado effects mid-way through). \\"Heartbreaker\\" has an amazingly intricate riff that only Page can deliver, and \\"The Lemon Song\\" switches styles throughout for over 6 minutes of fun. Then there is \\"Moby Dick\\", which showcases Bonham's amazing talents on the drums (and the bongos). Add Robert Plant's signature hypnotic wailing and John Paul Jones' technical proficiency to Bonham's furious drumming style and Page's inventive riffs, and you have Zep at their absolute finest on this album. This was before Zep really started their obsession with everything medieval, and it is one hell of an album.
B000002KCV|5.0|\\"Comes a Time,\\" \\"Lotta Love,\\" and \\"Four Stong Winds,\\" are gems.  Nice CD. Very well done.  These kinds of albums are better than his \\"rockers.\\"  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002YLC24|4.0|I never thought 1995's \\"Before Sunrise\\" was any great shakes perhaps because the concept felt like a romantic conceit albeit an intelligently scripted one especially for a film about a couple of kids in their early twenties. Time has probably mellowed me, as I find director Richard Linklater's 2004 sequel an entertaining talkfest that pierces with certain life truths. Nine years after their life-altering brief encounter in Vienna, Jesse and Celine meet again in Paris. Now a successful first-time novelist on a book tour, he sees her show up at his final book signing at the famous Shakespeare & Co. bookstore, and after some hesitation, they pick up where they left off. Celine is now an environmental activist, and their conversation continues for nearly an hour and a half in real time, before Jesse is scheduled to catch a plane home to his wife and son. Linklater follows the lovers -- who had promised to reunite in Vienna in six months and never did -- from cafe to park to boat to an intense car ride to Celine's apartment. In a manner that seems even closer to Louis Malle's \\"My Dinner With Andre\\" than the first one, they spend the time talking about the passage of time, shifting ideals both political and romantic, harbored ambitions, unfulfilled desire, religion, sex and monogamy and inconsistent memories.<br /><br />Looking particularly aged compared to the flashbacks from the first movie, Ethan Hawke effortlessly captures the frustrated ennui of an unfulfilled artist, his romantic ideals reborn by this unexpected encounter. But it's Julie Delpy who more dexterously shows the subtle impact of her diminished expectations against her luminous former self, peaking with her visceral emotional breakdown in the car. She also shows herself to be a fine singer as she performs a plaintive waltz for Jesse at the end. The film is quite brief, just eighty minutes long, but it feels like the right length given the story's limited focus. Truth be told, there is still an air of self-indulgent pretension to some of their bantering, though I have come to accept the fact that this is a truthful aspect of their respective characters and the basis of their chemistry together. The fact that there is an easy, unforced air about their dialogue has a lot to do with Hawke's and Delpy's contributions to the script (they receive co-screenwriting credit) and with the real rapport between the two actors. The DVD is relatively short on extras, for instance, there is surprisingly no audio commentary track, but there is a brief making-of featurette that helps provide the context of the story relative to the previous movie.nt pretension to some of their bantering, though I have come to accept the fact that this is a truthful aspect of their respective characters and the basis of their chemistry together.

1400032717|5.0|I read this book and could not put it down.  It gives great insight into the mind of an autistic child.  It also reminds me of the thinking of child, that innocent curiosity and honesty.  It almost makes you want to go back to that point in your life, and/or wish you still thought like that today.  A great, entertaining, weekend read.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|For the fans (like me), this is pure heaven....As much as I loved the SFAM DVD, this is much better on the sound and production end, and includes a lot of goodies for the fans (like me!)  Each track/selection left me, well, just breathless.  DT are truly some of the best musicians out there (if the THE best), and the variety of selections left a lot of room for them to show their best - from the Metallica-ish pounding of their more recent (ToT) stuff to the select best from Six Degrees and SFAM...the bonus stuff is truly a bonus for the music lover like me, especially the 'intro' video I saw on their Phoenix tour in 2004 for ToT...way cool!  The Portnoy drum solo thing is pretty cool too - and to think that any sentence with the word 'drum solo' should be sentenced to death, well, check this out and you just may enjoy it!   <br /> <br />I guess that a 46 year old like me should be too old for this stuff, but heck, I say no way.  DT are an unbelieviable group of musicians that are keeping the prog-rock sound alive and well, and as derivative as some critics stamp them, I say \\"TAKE ME AS I AM\\" - the legions of fans cannot be wrong.  This fan will be getting every DT DVD and CD for a LONG time.
B0009HLDFU|3.0|Yeah it all I have to say. This cd was excellent BUT.... do NOT buy the cd version if you want to put the album on your I-Pod or any other mp3 device. Because of the cd's anti-copy protection, you can't even play it on the computer. I suggest buying it on I-Tunes or Napster in order to be satisfied. Now I can only listen to this cd in the car!
B00003CXA6|5.0|This is probably my favorite film of all time, as it smacks of heroism on both sides.  Maxwell did such an outstanding job of representing both sides well.<br /><br />However, several years ago, a Director's Cut came out on VHS, with scenes that NEVER should have been cut, and I would love to see this on DVD.
B00079FUI6|5.0|Desperate Housewives is a phenomenon and a true master of the TV industry. This DVD set is a recap and more of the episodes on TV. Each character is well-developed, each with his or her troubles and problems. The setting is perfect and the show is well-balanced with tearful scenes and shocking revelations. Funny lines are present too, mostly in the characters of Edie Britt (Nicolette Sheridan)and Bree Van De Kamp (Marcia Cross). The show is not without its level of darkness and mystery. Who killed Mary Alice Young? What is Paul Young hiding? What exactly is Mike Delfino doing in Wisteria Lane? The plot is good, and there is massive eye candy in the form of John the gardener (Jesse Metcalfe) and Mike Delfino (James Denton). The flawless, snappy script and perfect, true acting from the actors and actresses (especially Teri Hatcher) form a great TV series that is even better when you watch it on DVD.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I have grown tired of the techno pop U2 has been coming out with and was looking for something fresh.  I stumbled on to Coldplay after hearing the song \\"Clocks\\".  I have been captured by the depth and acoustics of this band.  They are truly gifted.   The more I listen to X&Y, the more I am hooked on Coldplay. They seem to be getting better every album.
B0006L16N8|2.0|I enjoyed _A Rush of Blood to Your Head_, but was disappointed by this new album.  Unpoetic lyrics set to random tunes. <br />
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldpaly is on their way to becoming a \\"U2\\" like band that has mass appeal in the world. The reason Coldplay is so significant and why they are important, is because Chris's lyrics that he writes are humbling and allow one to connect with the spirit. His style of writing is very much like Bono which tries to get one to frocus on the the world around them, and not the inner makings of themselves. Coldplay is on their way to becoming the U2 for the new millenium. A band that has much to say and many people listening. Thank you Chris Martin for helping us rediscover what makes music special. A truly remarkable album.
B000002V1D|3.0|I'm a great fan of these guys, but this album is like my review title: irregular <br />Forgive me. <br />These songs are gems: Ordinary world and Come Undone at full version comparing <br />to the \\"Greatest\\" compilation, Too much information (refers to the TV media) <br /> <br />Breath after breath contains a duet between the Brazilian Milton Nascimento(singing in Portuguese) <br />and Le Bon. Interesting,different and decent. <br />Femme fatale and Love Voodoo are smypathetic. <br />None of the above and Shelter are cool. <br /> <br />These are garbage:  <br />Drowning man -> Irritating.Even listening several times,I coudn't take anything useful. <br />UMF -> I disliked it so much at first listen that I ALWAYS press the skip button on it. <br />To whom it may concern -> Boring <br />Sin of the city -> Repetitive <br /> <br />With the exception of Liberty and Thank you I listened to all of their studio stuff. <br />I never found so many bad songs in a Duran Duran album.This cd wasn't as I hoped. <br /> <br />I you want their best,buy Notorious, Big Thing,Astronaut or Seven and the Ragged Tiger.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Nothing beats The Last Waltz or The Concert for Bangledesh, but this is the closest thing to a well filmed concert!  Eagles fan or no (as long as you like the hits) this show looks and sounds great.  Added are the interviews which are interesting as well. Note - if you saw the televised NBC show the interviews were interspersed with the concert, however on this dvd the concert footage stands alone...to allow for complete uninterrupted entertainment!
B0009HLDFU|5.0|Being a huge fan of The Colour and the Shape I was a little skeptical of how this album would measure up but I've found it to be just as good and at times even better. If you haven't bought it yet and are worried about the copy protection go buy it from iTunes. If you don't have an iPod then then don't hesitate and just go buy the CD.
B0006399FS|3.0|Yes, this album is average. Yes, it's no big deal. But there's aplus to it: it comes with the name \\"U2\\" on it. And that's a quality certificate. <br /> <br />Bands that last so long have usually some great skill, and U2 has a LOT of skills. This new album is nothing fantastic, but it's like security blanket for U@ fans: it clearly shows the band is still capable of recording grat stuff without selling out.
B00028HBKC|1.0|I fail to understand this movie.  Having heard how it had been a transformational experience for some, I rather expected something more profound than this.  I found it expressionistic but in a totally hamfisted way.  There's no doubt that most Christian religions tend to sterilize the memory of what was by all accounts a brutal torture, and this movie at least serves to make the viewer remember.  That's fine.  It's important, to a Christian, to try to go right there.  Every Good Friday, since I was a child I have very slowly counted out and thought about the 39 Lashes.  But the scourging portrayed here is so overdone that it is almost comical. <br /> <br />In sum, I just can't account for the almost pornographic fixation on torture, suffering and blood.  What's the point?  It serves no particular purpose.   <br /> <br />Given the movie's supposed fixation on retelling it \\"as it was\\", little details bugged me.  It's fairly well established that Christ carried only the pantabulum, or cross-piece, to the cross, not the entire thing (which would have weighed ~350 pounds) -- the uprights having been already set in the ground.  It's fairly well established that those unfortunates who were nailed to crosses had nails through their wrists rather than their palms.  In Mel's movie, the height of the cross increases drastically as the movie goes on -- the high cross at the end is a good 4-6 feet higher than what they show Jesus carrying out of Jerusalem!!!  The water that gushes out when Jesus is prodded with a spear -- it is reasonably well settled by medical experts that a bit of water _can_ in fact collect in the body in extreme duress such as this -- but the cheesy unnatural animation in the movie was altogether 1930s in feel.  And in none of the four Gospels is there the slightest mention of the Devil, or a snake, in the Garden of Gethsemane -- that's purely a Gibson conceit. <br /> <br />The actors are utterly cartoonish.  Not one personality was developed beyond the level of caricature.  There's a slight hint at the complexity of Pilate's character. <br /> <br />It seems absolutely bizarre to me that \\"The Passion\\" was so successful.  I cannot think of a single thing about it to recommend to others.  There have been many, many, many more profound retellings of this amazing story.  Retellings that leave the viewer inspired, or angry, or sad, or amazed, or touched.  This just left me empty.
B000085RTX|5.0|Okay, Khan's not the greatest singer in the world.  Youngblood's not the greatest guitarist.  But we know from basketball that it takes more than just having the greatest players to make a good team, and Kamelot proves that the opposite is true as well.  You can have a band made up of artists who are lesser than the best, but who still can blow other bands out of the water. <br /> <br />Blind Guardian has Hansi, probably the best singer in power/speed metal, but they have yet to release anything that blows my mind completely. <br /> <br />Angra has some of the best keyboards and choral arrangements, but  Andre Matos and their latest lead singer (can't remember his name) are both far too high-pitched for my taste. <br /> <br />Iced Earth has Jon Schaffer, probably my favorite power metal guitarist. <br /> <br />If you put all my favorite power metal artists together, however, you'd probably come up with one crappy album.  Demons and Wizards was good, but try adding Angra's keyboards to that or something.  It would be awful. <br /> <br />So what Kamelot has here, with Karma, is a few talented musicians who are able to work together and make an album where nothing sounds out of place.  No cheesy over-the-top Blind Guardian/Rhapsody choruses, for example.  Perhaps what I like about Kamelot is their ability, despite the subject matter, to actually get in there at the humanity behind it all.  We have all wondered what we would give to have eternal life, so \\"Elizabeth\\" parts 1, 2, and 3 is especially haunting.  \\"Forever\\" is about our wish to be united with our loved ones in the afterlife.  \\"The Spell\\" is about our desire for fantasy, or rather, our desire to transcend the ordinary.  Somehow, Kamelot even pull off \\"Don't You Cry\\" without sounding cheesy, and that is a real feat.  Of course, there is real emotion behind that song, and every instrument carries it perfectly, including Khan's voice. <br /> <br />This is a surprisingly good power metal album, and can probably even be approachable to those who beforehand have turned away from the genre because it is \\"too cheesy\\".  Don't get me wrong, I do like some of the cheesier stuff, but this recording shows that you can have epic music without the cheese.
044024157X|4.0|OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT I FOUND IT TOTALLY UNNECESSARY FOR GRISHAM TO INSERT HIS LEFT WING POLITICAL VIEWS IN THIS OTHER WISE <br />VERY GOOD BOOK, I COULD GIVE IT A 5 STAR RATING. I FOUND NO NEED FOR HIM TO EXPOUND ON \\"HIS POLITICS\\" AS THE STORY WAS SO GOOD.......THIS ONLY DETRACTED FROM THE EXCELLENT STORY AND WRITING. <br /> <br />I HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED MOST OF GRISHAM'S BOOKS AND FOUND THIS TO BE ONE OF HIS BEST BUT LEAVE THE POLITICS TO THE NEWSPAPERS, ETC AND KEEP <br />ON WRITING GOOD STORIES, JOHN.
B000050IE6|5.0|\\"The Moor\\" is one of my favorite Opeth songs ever.  I hesitate to call it merely a song; it is more of an experience.  Akerfeldt's voice and the brilliant composition together take you on an epic emotional journey.  But that journey does not stop with \\"The Moor\\", but continues on through \\"White Cluster\\".  Every track is awesome, with \\"The Moor\\", \\"Godhead's Lament\\", \\"Face of Melinda\\", and \\"White Cluster\\" standing out over the others.  \\"Benighted\\" is also excellent.  And that's nearly the whole album.  Basically, the album itself is the standout track.  Of course, the album does not stand out from other Opeth albums, as they are all just about as good as this. <br /> <br />However, those of you who are new to Opeth and have only heard Damnation, be warned that they do use death vocals in a lot of their songs on other albums.  Obviously, this does not bother me in the least.  The music, however, whether you are into the vocal style or not is nothing short of amazing.
B00005JNJT|5.0|After director Joel Schumacher made Batman a travesty of the character and left the series in shambles with his showboat-over-produced-butt-and-crotch-shot-flash-in-the-pan `96 release of Batman and Robin, it was extremely hard to see a Batman film in the future that would be worth any appeal whatsoever. Thankfully, director Chris Nolan saw this as an opportunity to do justice to the series, as well as completely reinvent it to peak the interest back into the original Batman fans, as well as create completely new fans for the new millennium.<br /><br />Batman Begins is a spectacular visual feast that not only exercises visual style, but focuses more on Batman as a character as opposed to how flashy his suit or how many things his Batmobile can do. And that's what I really liked about this movie, it was more real than most of the Batman films, not substituting substance for rubberized crotch or butt shots.<br /><br />And I think fans of the comic book will find this one especially interesting because this is probably the darkest Batman flick, both visually and thematically and definitely stays truer to its origins.<br /><br />I was also very pleased to see The Scarecrow villain in Batman Begins, being a huge fan of his from the animated series on Fox sometime ago.<br /><br />Aside from all that, I thought Batman Begins had a strong story going for it, answering all the right questions I've always had about how Batman became Batman; where did he learn to fight? and where did he get all his things like his suit and grappling guns?<br /><br />If you were just as disappointed with the last couple of Batman flicks as I was or never found Batman appealing at all really, I recommend seeing Batman Begins, because it is in the truest sense of the phrase, a new beginning in the series and will have you praising Chris Nolan for either breathing a much need breath of fresh air in the series or giving you an interest in this more modern Batman.
B000002KHH|5.0|Regardless of what music you listen to, regardless of your notions of heavy metal in general, if you're here now, looking up 70s music or whatever, just click \\"buy\\".  Because this should be in everyone's collection who listens to 70s or even 80s rock.  \\"Iron Man\\" is one of the most influential songs on modern metal, nu-metal, grunge, etc. and \\"Paranoid\\" is one of the most influential songs on alternative punk. <br /> <br />The lyrics of \\"War Pigs\\" are still effective today; someone wrote them on the wall of a tunnel near my university after Bush declared war on Iraq.  \\"Planet Caravan\\" is a real treat, a grooving bass line and Ozzy's deep voice used here (something you rarely hear on Ozzy's solo albums). <br /> <br />\\"Electric Funeral\\" is a very simple song, but still heavy and catchy.  \\"Hand Of Doom\\" is excellent. <br /> <br />\\"Rat Salad\\" is a great metal instrumental, very short, very nice drumwork by Bill Ward. <br /> <br />Finally, \\"Faeries Wear Boots\\" is simply awesome. <br /> <br />If you want to know where metal came from, this is it.  This along with the debut are essential for anyone desiring a complete music collection encompassing all genres.  Or just someone into Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, etc. <br /> <br />Oh, and if you're a metal fan, and you haven't bought this album yet, what are you waiting for?  An invitation?  Well, here it is.  I invite you to take this chance to explore the influences your music came from.

B000683VI4|5.0|This movie really moved me. It is extremely well acted, and the setting is gorgeous (the South in the late 30's). Most movies of the genre fail to prove the two really care and love each another but \\"The Notebook\\" really captured that. Even though the plot was somewhat predictable,  I found myself cheering for them (as well as crying).   You want Allie to listen to her heart, as opposed to trying to please everybody around her (first her parents, then Lon, her new fiance who does happen to be a nice guy and which makes her decision even more difficult). Lon would make a good husband but Allie is missing something with him that she can't even pinpoint. She just finds out she does not get inspiration for her painting when she is with him.  In the end, you just want Allie and Noah to grow old together because you know that in spite of their fights, they are truly meant for each other.

Heck, I even like Fantasia.<br /><br />Even though I like the book, \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,\\" more than I like the Disney film, the film is still magnificent.  The animation is nothing short of gorgeous, as is the case with all of Disney's animation, and the continuity is solid.  The characters are instantly likeable, and I just love the songs.  I would recommend this movie to anybody.  It's a classic.

0064407667|5.0|Written not just for kids, but enjoyable for any sort of age, this is a beginning of a different sort of children's literature. No goblins, no boogeyman, no ghost nor monster lurking under the bed. But mostly telling a story of a harsh reality base fiction about 3 suddenly orphaned Baudelaires children; namely Violet (Inventor), Klaus (Bookworm) & Sunny (Biter).<br /><br />It began with the horrible news regarding the demised of their parents in a weird fire that burnt down their house, leaving them with a fortune that's not spendable until Violet, the eldest, reach the age of 18. Mr Poe, is the one in charged of them until he found a guardian for the kids, which came the character Count Olaf. A count and an actor, who do whatever in his power to keep them as miserble as he could until he could touch their rightful inheritance. And when I say do whatever, I meant whatever! From serving them lumpy porridges, making them do all sort of chores, repairing the Count's manor and to wed the eldest child, Violet.<br /><br />Another feature of this series would be the introducing of advance vocabulary for the kids, alongside its meaning into the context. It would be a great learning tool for any parents who would like to introduce some major words for their kids, without pulling out a dictionary.
B000001AKM|5.0|I must admit that I hadn't listened to Lionel Richie in about 20 years, but for some reason I felt compelled to purchase this CD a few years back - and I am really glad that I did!<br /><br />\\"Back to Front\\" is filled with the best love songs ever sung by this amazing artist!  It's one of those CD's where every song is great, and the artists passion is palpable.  Plus, it brought with it some wonderful memories from my high school days - when Lionel Richie was at the top of his game.<br /><br />I would recommend this CD to anyone who remembers listening to Lionel Richie in the past - once you hear him again, you'll remember why you loved these songs back then!  I would also highly recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys listening to great love songs - Lionel Richie is one of the best crooners out there!
B0007XT7V8|5.0|To start, if anyone is unsure of whether to purchase this album or not, you can listen to each full song on mp3.com. <br /> <br />This cd is amazing, one of the best I own. Many people compare their sound to Nickelback, but in my opinion, Theory is much more talented. All of the songs are high-quality and have the chance to be a hit. <br /> <br />1. Hating Hollywood- Really good song and a great way to start off the album. 10/10 <br />2. No Way Out- Good song, not one of my favorites, but it fits well. 8/10 <br />3. No Surprise- The first single off of the album, and the song that turned me onto this album. Very good song, well deserving of the first hit. 10/10 <br />4. Quiver- This song has been stuck in my head since the first time I heard it. 10/10 <br />5. Santa Monica- Another one of the singles off the cd. Not one of my personal favorites, but it still is a good song. 8.5/10 <br />6. Better Off- Very fast-paced, solid song. 10/10 <br />7. Say Goodbye- This song has slow verses and a fast chorus, which combine to form one of my favorite songs. 10/10 <br />8. Hello Lonely- A slow song, doesn't really do it for me. 8/10 <br />9. Me and My Girl- Fast paced verses and a heavy chorus form a great song here. 9/10 <br />10. Since You've Been Gone- Another slow song, I'm not a huge fan of this song. 8/10 <br />11. Hell Just Ain't the Same- Sort of weird song, different than all of the other songs thay Theory sings. Very short, only like a minute long. 7.5/10 <br />12. Save the Best For Last- Very catchy chorus on this song, if this was the final song, it would have closed the cd on a great song. My other favorite. 10/10 <br />13. The Middle- Not a great closer, I would have preferred to see Save the Best For Last close this cd. 8/10 <br /> <br />All in all, this is an incredible cd. Theory of a Deadman is a very talented band and have produced a great rock album. All fans of rock music should purchase this cd.
B0006213WG|5.0|Although different from their other albums, Sum 41's Chuck still possesses the spark that was apparent in their earlier work. Long gone are the songs of angry teenagers and comical songs, replaced by songs about bigger problems like \\"Some Say\\" and \\"We're All to Blame\\". Sum 41 demonstrates an enormous leap tourds maturity. The songs seem heartfelt, in fact there's nothing funny about them, there is only serious and guitar riffs that seem to cut to the soul. Chuck is without a doubt one of Sum 41's best albums and is one that will be enjoyable many years from now
0786890754|4.0|Although this is Ms. Ahern's first novel, she does a nice job expressing the sentiment involved with love and life after the death of a spouse.  It is a quick read, perfect for a \\"by the pool\\" book, touching lightly on the sadness of this young widow without being too heavy.  The relationship between the friends is pretty well examined by other authors, and tends to be stereotypical, but not uninteresting.  Any reader of Chick Lit expects some similarities between books, and this is no exception.  Although not an epic, it is a story that is well suited for its genre, a quick page turner, and a feel-good read.
B00005JNJT|3.0|Varios escalones m&aacute;s arriba que las olvidables pel&iacute;culas sobre el encapuchado dirigidas por Joel Schumacher, pero inferior a las versiones del magn&iacute;fico Tim Burton, 'Batman Inicia' le da algo de aire a una franquicia que, luego de dos fracasos consecutivos, parec&iacute;a agotada.<br /><br />El filme explora los or&iacute;genes del h&eacute;roe creado por Bob Kane, uno de los m&aacute;s oscuros y complejos del mundo del c&oacute;mic. Logra profundizar -con aceptable &eacute;xito- sobre la psiquis del personaje y su motivaci&oacute;n para enfrentar al mal, pero apenas sale a flote en un punto en que toda pel&iacute;cula de este g&eacute;nero deber&iacute;a destacarse: el entretenimiento. A 'Batman Inicia' le falta acci&oacute;n y las contadas escenas de pelea est&aacute;n filmadas demasiado sobre los actores, lo que hace que los movimientos resulten poco discernibles.<br /><br />Adem&aacute;s, si bien es necesaria una justificaci&oacute;n de las habilidades para el combate del hombre murci&eacute;lago, el adiestramiento de Bruno Diaz con ninjas en un monasterio en la alta monta&ntilde;a, recuerda a esas pel&iacute;culas de artes marciales que pueden encontrarse en la tev&eacute; un s&aacute;bado a la tarde.<br /><br />Ya entrenado y de regreso en Ciudad G&oacute;tica (que con buen criterio nuevamente luce dark como la de Burton y no rococ&oacute; como en las pifias de Schumacher), Batman debe detener a un capo mafia y a un psiquiatra descarriado, quien busca enloquecer a toda la poblaci&oacute;n.<br /><br />La pel&iacute;cula se debate entre un predominante paso lento y algunas escenas abruptas, que desentonan pero logran el avance del relato. La explicaci&oacute;n verbal por parte de un personaje de lo que est&aacute; sucediendo, que se da reiteradas veces en el filme, denota cierta incapacidad para trasmitir desde las im&aacute;genes, que sorprende de un director como Christopher Nolan, quien se destac&oacute; con 'Memento'.<br /><br />Christian Bale, un actor no muy conocido para la mayor&iacute;a, pero que cuenta con varios papeles protag&oacute;nicos en su haber ('El Imperio del Sol', 'Psic&oacute;pata Americano' y 'Equilibrium', entre otros), realiza una buena labor y no hace extra&ntilde;ar a Michael Keaton, quien se hab&iacute;a puesto el traje en 'Batman' y 'Batman Vuelve'. Los dem&aacute;s protagonistas: Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes y Gary Oldman, demuestran s&oacute;lo parte de lo que pueden ofrecer.<br /><br />La trama, que no incluye a ninguno de los principales villanos del encapuchado y permite reservarlos para futuras secuelas, resulta relativamente interesante hasta el final, donde patina un poco por un cierre que no parece demasiado meditado. A pesar de sus carencias, el filme no resulta un fiasco como los dos anteriores -protagonizados por Val Kilmer y George Clooney respectivamente- y abre la posibilidad a que haya Batman para rato.uien se haba puesto el traje en 'Batman' y 'Batman Vuelve'.

B00005JMJG|5.0|HADRIAN VII - Peter Luke, hope fully still available for Mr. Carrey, a brilliant misused talent.  As Ms. Winsley aptly proclaims : She's the Jim Carrey in this oddball, very Jean Cocteau inspired version [or Luis Bunel who paved the way] - \\"This is ME and ME wants all!\\" kinda movie.<br /><br />Now it is not for all - this guy [Orpheee] seeks his Euridice, except she's dishing him in a grand way.<br /><br />Stay tuned folks, and watch the 'levels of consciousness' evolve.  The Dunst kid and ensemble are well worth mention.<br /><br />EXCELLENT work for the connoisseur.
B00063MBU8|1.0|This is not worth buying at all. It is just recycled overrated crap. This guy sounds like my brother singing in the shower! and believe me, that is not a good thing. Being a musician and singer, I felt deeply saddened that these 'musicians' if you can call them that, have actually gotten a record deal when there are so many other yearning artists who actually have real, original talent out there. Also, boys, do you know why you \\"aren't getting any\\" ?? because you are absolute rot! This is why there hasn't been a musical revolution in the last 40 years or so.
B000687M48|5.0|I absolutly love this album...I think it's totally worth the money.  The songs are great.  There not your average music u listen  on the radio.  I think that there's a song that almost everyone can realate to on this cd. <br /> <br />The bonus dvd is wonderful.  The concert was sensational..I almost felt like I was at the concert.  The bonus footage of the band was hilarious.  Some of the stuff this band does is really funny.  I would totally buy this albumm if I hadn't already.
B0002OERI0|5.0|My friend Steve first told me about Green Day's \\"American Idiot\\" being released. He told me about how great \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" was. I went to Best Buy not long after and picked it up. Well, all I have to say is that it is a truly awesome album! The best part is that it is one big story about Billie Joe, so all of the songs are tied together, instead of just having great songs that are sung by the same people but have totally different meanings. <br /> <br />You know, when you listen to Dookie, Warning, and their other releases, you do see how Billie Joe, Mike, and Tre have changed...changed for the better, that is. This CD shows that Green Day will not be just another band that gets off to a blazing start and then crumbles soon after. The song American Idiot isn't even the best track on the CD. BOBD may be the best, Holiday is awesome, especially as a lead in to BOBD, and When September Ends is an awesome song that mixes the beat of the album nicely. <br /> <br />In conclusion, this new release has brought Green Day out to a greater audience while retaining it's already faithful legion of fans. It deserves the Grammy that it won, no question about it. And one last thing...this album is so good that I can't imagine how great their next one will be!
B00005JNJT|5.0|An Action Pact Movie without swearing or explicit sex... don't need it with a movie like this.  ACTION PACKED and loved seeing all of the seasoned actors... a real treat.
B00003CWTI|4.0|Like anything people can create, opinions will vary and it's nice to have that choice of being able to like what you want and pursue your specific interests since there's so much material and picks to choose from. But then what if a film gets unanimous acclaim and everyone enjoys it yet you didn't like it from the start or just simply were too slow to notice its faults or greatness? Such was the case with Magnolia which I found on first viewing to be incredibly self-indulgent and seemed as if it wanted to do anything it can so that people can see what a complex and ambitious work it was. Second viewing? I liked it more.    The film has a wide assortment of characters with the key being that they all intersect and through association, know each other. But basically we have a self-help guru for men (Tom Cruise), a talk show host (Philip Baker Hall), an ailing old man (Jason Robards), his wife (Julianne Moore) and his nurse (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), the talk show host's daughter (Melora Walters) who meets a nice cop one day (John C. Reilly), and a former contestant on the show (William H. Macy). The film takes on the issues of death, consequence and fate and whether things can really be called coincidences.    Magnolia I think is one of those kind of films where there's just a genuine spunk of energy and spontaneity that even if you didn't like it, you had to admit there's a lot of passion to make it work and everyone gives it their all. From rock-solid performances all around from Cruise (yes, I said him: forget the crazy antics, when he wants, he CAN act) to the Reilly/Walters story to the confidence in the writing and directing, it's a film I can certainly appreciate. But that don't mean it isn't completely flawless: the length might get to people (3 hours and 10 mins or so), the frogs will completely come out of left field if it wasn't spoiled before and some storylines or characters could've been exorcised completely. On and the tagline might as well be \\"we may be through with the past but the past ain't through with us\\" so it's repeated no less than 4 times.     But the film for all its issues never once gets dull or you start to tune out of the whole story. From the characters to even the pacing and several memorable moments, there's always something that'll click. And when something doesn't, such as a cop's run-in with a profanity-spewing woman (like every word of dialogue literally has a swear in it it seems) or a long stretch of scenes accompanied by tense score that makes it seem like a 20 minute long crescendo, there's character moments like a bedside confessional or the delightful closing shot that helps bring the film back. It might not all work but not once does it feel incoherent or sloppy.    1999 was a huge year for movies with stuff like the Blair Witch Project doing something different and fresh though not altogether innovative to American Beauty which brought with it more indie-minded filmmaking to the Matrix and its visuals, Magnolia fits right in. Not the most accessible film in his oeuvre and even polarizing for some but it can connect with some.
B000001ELB|5.0|The time:1978.By then,several popular hard rock bands had come along and shown several people good times,and of course,one of those bands had proven to be KISS. Gene Simmons,Paul Stanley,Ace Frehley,and Peter Criss had all become idolized by several people in America and had all proved to be musical geniuses-but problems in the band were arising,and before Gene Simmons,Paul Stanley,Ace Frehley,and Peter Criss would go on to make their solo albums and also make the TV film \\"KISS Meets The Phanthom Of The Park\\"(their solo albums and that TV movie both first saw the light of day in '78),they released their first greatest hits compilation,\\"Double Platinum\\".How does KISS' first compilation(which would also become the first of several KISS compilations)measure up? Read on for my review of this: <br /> <br />This compilation is really the best KISS compilation that has ALL 70's material on it. It takes material from KISS'self-titled debut album(1974),\\"Hotter Than Hell\\"(1974),\\"Dressed To Kill\\"(1975),\\"Destroyer\\"(1976),\\"Rock and Roll Over\\"(1976),and \\"Love Gun\\"(1977). The only albums that were left out with this compilation were the two \\"Alive!\\" albums that had been released at that point. Don't expect songs like \\"Shock Me\\" and \\"Take Me\\" to be here,but you do get KISS klassics like \\"Detroit Rock City\\",\\"Beth\\",\\"Rock and Roll All Nite\\",\\"Love Gun\\",etc.,as well as some of KISS' best songs that were not their most popular songs(100,000 Years,Makin' Love,C'mon and Love Me,among others)were also included here. I won't give away everything,but KISS' remake of the song \\"Strutter\\" that appeared on their first record-\\"Strutter '78\\"-is also here-and this compilation is the ONLY KISS album that has that remake on here. And before you here the song \\"She\\",before it gets into the lyrics and music,here they included the intro for \\"Rock Bottom\\"(both She and Rock Bottom were originally issued on Dressed To Kill,although both tracks were three spaces apart from each other).Another cool thing aboutthis compilation is that Robert V. Conte wrote liner notes inside the album sheet about KISS' career in 1978 and how KISS was becoming bigger and how the problems in the band were becoming worse,among several other interesting facts that are good to include as a part of a compilation for ANY band. You even get a platinium award inside the liner notes that they put in there as a thank you to the KISS army for making KISS as huge as they had become and even helped them to stay popular today. <br /> <br />Overall,a good compilation. There are several and too many KISS compilations available by now,so if You're new to KISS,then my recommendation is to start with their 2001 self-titled box set that has five discs of KISS material ranging from the 70's,80's,and 90's as well as a booklet with pictures of the band inside the liner notes,a story about the band in the begining of the booklet,and stories of every song from either Gene Simmons,Paul Stanley,Peter Criss,and/or Ace Frehley. But wait-that compilation is very expensive-if you can't afford it then you can get this,or \\"Smashes,Thrashes,and Hits\\",an affordable KISS compilation from 1988 that takes their material from the 70's and the 80's and puts it all on one disc. Either way,this is an excellent compilation,and it's a shame that problems and laziness in the band have again caused some of the band members to go their seperate ways(Peter was fired from the group after he had returned because Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley thought that his drumming on the KISS/Aerosmith tour was weak and also because they claimed that he complained to much on the tour,and Ace Frehley claimed that he left the group not because of problems with his former band members but becasue he wanted to work on his new solo album).I miss the days when Gene,Paul,Ace,and Peter were together and making great music(but Tommy Thayer and Eric Singer are great rock 'n rollers as well-NO questions asked).
B00005JNJT|2.0|Problem number one, the action scenes are horrible. I found it really frustrating watching the fight scenes that blurred by so fast that I couldn't tell what was happening.<br /><br />Problem number 2, too much boring plot. The ninja training, Bale with a beard; it reminded me more of \\"the last Samurai\\", then Batman. It's almost as if the director wanted to do a \\"highlander\\" film, but got stuck with Batman, so decided to make Batman \\"Braveheart\\".<br /><br />Problem 3, the allstar cast. Did anyone else get the feeling that the big stars were casted just to have their name added on the credits? There was no reason to have Morgan Freeman in his small part, Katie Holmes didn't impress me, Rutger Hauer was good but wasted in such a small role, Michael Caine (of the original Italian Job 1969) wasn't a spectacular Alfred, Liam Neeson (of Rob Roy 1995) was very good as Batmans tutor, but I hated that part of the plot, and Christian Bale (one of my favorite actors from American psycho 2000) was a good Batman, but not as good as the original keaton.<br /><br />This film was okay, but not as good as the original 1989 Burton film. Yes, it's a return to a darker Batman, but it's a very boring Batman with very few if any interesting characters. One character I liked was Scarecrow and the actor who played him, but there wasn't enough scarecrow. As soon as Scarecrows plot got interesting it was over and replaced by a boring plot involving the ninjas and a water vaporizor.<br /><br />Anyone remember the Saturday night live skit with Christopher Walken were he plays a record producer, and he is asking for more cowbell? Well, Im asking for more Scarecrow. I have a flu and the only cure is more scarecrow. Jokes aside, the film was a bit of a letdown.<br /><br />(update 6/25/05)<br />I knew alot of people would be so desperate for a good batman that they would lie to themselves and say this movie is great. In my opinion, you can take this film and throw it in the overrated garbage bin! It's retarded people like you (the ones who like this movie), who are killing American mainstream movies. You keep settling for garbage and that's what you will keep getting. morons!<br /><br />(update 7/6/05)<br /><br />A sequel is already in the works. Well, pump it out quick while there is people still desperate and stupid enough to see this Hollywoood garbage.<br /><br />Hey, anyone remember the days when movies were made to entertain people instead of making fast money from a desperate public?<br /><br />(update 8/25/05)<br />The 1989 Batman will still be talked about as a classic 20 years from now. Great lines, actors, and action. Nobody will remember this overrated piece of crap film.who like this movie), who are killing American mainstream movies. You keep settling for garbage and that's what you will keep getting. morons!    (update 7/6/05)    A sequel is already in the works. Well, pump it out quick while there is people still desperate and stupid enough to see this Hollywoood garbage.

B00005JNJT|5.0|Forget about all the other Batman movies before this one. This movie is visually astounding, and loaded with action that will have you on the edge of your seat! Batman has new gadgets that are cooler than ever. Needless to say, the Batmobile is awsome. In my opinion, a unstopable beast on wheels! You gotta see the movie to believe me. This Batman Begins is truely the beginning of a great run of Batman movies! These movies can only get better and better!
B00004X01U|2.0|I really thought Madonna was beginning to mature and have some insight into the higher nature of things.  However, this album and the ones that followed were all regressions.  She still seems to have retained her crudeness (or is that cruelness) in flipping off random people for no apparent reason.  Her sense of entitlement is a far cry from enlightenment.   <br />Go back to the drawing board Madonna until you get it right.
B000683VI4|1.0|The main characters in this film have the same names as the main characters in Nicholas Sparks' novel, but the resemblance ends there.  While the film might be entertaining to some, this reviewer found it to be annoying and uninspiring.  The Allie and Noah in the book were portrayed as sensitive, intelligent and thoughtful individuals.  The Allie and Noah in the film are just two more average, impulsive teenagers with no special or endearing qualities and not a lot of common sense.  The reference to the elderly Allie's illness as \\"senile dementia\\" is misleading and inaccurate.  This reviewer recommends reading the book or listening to the book-on-tape for an inspiring love story and a more realistic and sensitive portrayal of Alzheimer's Disease and it's impact on the well spouse.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This is one of the best albums ever. Every song is near flawless. Coldplay is on the right track and getting better with each CD they make. This is about as perfect as perfect gets. \\"X&Y\\" is textbook 10/10.  <br /> <br />In a world where brilliance is becoming a rarity, Coldplay has proven that it's still alive and well. <br />
B0009353IW|3.0|I have virtually every record that Ry ever made -- mostly on mint LPs -- and I am undoubtedly one of his most loyal fans. Imagine my excitement, as someone who was born in Cuba and who grew up in Venezuela, to discover the Buena Vista Social Club (BVSC) CD. I have immense respect for Ry for reaching out and experimenting with different music genres while successfully infusing his own magic, both in the arrangements and his guitar prowess, even in the most foreign of productions. Despite all the accolades I can pour on Ry, though, I have to say: What's with the obsession with Mexico, one of the least musically interesting Latin countries??? If you must go Chicano, do yourself a favor and team up with Santana, who can instill the best of Mexican \\"soul\\" while still appealing to an international audience. Ry was on to something very special when he woke up the whole BVSC scene. As a footnote, let me tell you that Cuban music -- especially circa-late '50's -- was unbelievably amazing and improvisational, with 10-minute long songs including solos from incredible piano, trumpet, sax, flute -- you name it. The incredibly moving \\"Cuban Jam Session\\" Volumes I and II, still available on Amazon, come to mind -- not to mention the many \\"Cachao\\" (Israel Lopez) Cuban CDs that have been released till as recently as just a year or two ago. Cachao was the bassist in those '50's \\"Cuban Jam Session\\" sessions, and at the age of 80+, he's still going strong. <br /> <br />In a nutshell, as compelling as the Chavez Ravine story is, the music does not do that story justice, let alone Ry's incomparable genius. Come on, Ry, seek out the likes of Ruben Gonzalez for your next effort! Go deep! Go join Cachao for a few sessions to reconnect yourself with top-shelf Latin music. Even his most recent CDs are excellent; they capture the authentic spirit of the very Cuban music you were so savvy to discover and leverage. On second thought, Ry, you don't owe anyone anything. But if you want to have a good time, go play with Cachao or anyone who is more inspired than the Chavez Ravine group. That Chicano story makes a good book but not a good CD. And that's coming from someone who loves Mexico and Mexicans, and has been there at least 20 times on business.
B0000017CA|5.0|I picked this CD up at Newbury Comics because I had heard from some fellow Metalheads that it kicked some serious arse. Well I must say I was totally blown away. Solid mix of thrash and grind and some other stuff mixed in makes this CD a must buy for metal fans, pick this CD up of you see it, you wont be sorry you did. A re-mastered version will be available soon according to their website, rock on metal heads!!!
B0009HLDFU|5.0|No offense to Nirvana fans, but by now it looks as though Dave Grohl and the Foo Fighters have transcended Nirvana. In Your Honor is without a doubt their best since 'The Colour and the Shape'. The one thing that has been evident with the Foo Fighters, is the fact that they seem to be lovers of the seventies singer / songwriters, back in the days when great songs mattered, where albums worked as an entire concept, the band is at least striving in that direction. I was practically stunned by how good this album was upon first listen. The rock side exceeded my expectations after the mixed results of their last album. 'In Your Honor' is a fine opening number that seg ways into the three way punch of 'No Way Back, Best Of You' and one of the albums best songs, 'DOA'. Only 'Hell' feels like album filler on the first disc. 'The Last Song' is a strong number while 'Free Me' feels a little sub par. 'Resolve' is another great number and the lead in to the great closing numbers, 'The Deepest Blues Are Black' which is an album highlight, and 'End Over End' a song about reincarnation I gathered and a solid rock album closer. <br /> <br />Disc two takes some amazing directions, while 'Still' is an interesting atmospheric opener, 'What If I Do?' is excellent and should be released as a future single. Great to see John Paul Jones on 'Miracle' which is another excellent track, 'Another Round' is good, although JPJ's mandolin is almost inconsequential in the track. 'Friend of a Friend' is a great example of how much Dave Grohl has grown as a song writer, this sounds like something from the period of his work with Nirvana, the fact that it seems to be about Kurt makes it touching. 'Over and Out' and 'On The Mend' are good tracks, yet I have to admit they feel like album filler. It's great to see Grohl and company branch out with a Jazz flavored number, 'Virginia Moon' with Norah Jones' harmony vocal and distinct piano, a nice touch. While it's nice to see Taylor Hawkins branch out with a vocal, 'Cold Day In the Sun' seems like the most general number and something that would have fit in during Rod Stewarts acoustic rock period of 'Every Picture Tells A Story'. 'Razor' is amazing and probably the highlight of the second disc, a haunting number and it sounds as though Josh Homme is doing most of that great classical guitar work. <br /> <br />I can't believe some of the people who are complaining about the copy protection format, I know I am about to offend some people here, but how spoiled can the iPod - MP3 users get? Perhaps the band wanted people to listen to the album as an entire entity, and not just pick out a few tracks, Perhaps the band wanted to bring back the artistic integrity of seventies albums that you had to listen to end to end. The duel disc format with the DVD material, while not essential, does add an extra value to the set. The Documentary is interesting. While it's true that there might be a touch of manufactured hype about this record, it does deliver and worth your while. <br />
B000062YAZ|5.0|One of the best if not the best thrash metal albums of all time. If you are a metal fan and dont have this already, get it the next time you are in a record store, no metal collection is complete without this alltime, legendary classic from the metal gods who are Slayer.
044024157X|4.0|Finally!!  After reading The Pelican Brief years ago, I dove into the world of Grisham.  I read The Street Lawyer, The Partner, The Chamber, The Testament, The Rainmaker, The Runaway Jury, The Firm, and then I started in on the newer ones.  Was I ever disappointed!  I wanted the Grisham I enjoyed so much from before.  Where was he?  What is this stuff he was putting out?  It was not the Grisham I enjoyed.  So, I gave up on him.<br /><br />My wife picked this up at a garage sale for 50 cents, so I gave it a whirl.  Finally, back to the classic Grisham.  Not his best work, but it is a start back in the right direction.  I enjoyed the book, the characters, the story, the familiar town.  A good story of people and life in the ever changing south in the 70's.<br /><br />If you want a dose of classic Grisham, give this a try and we'll all hope he continues back to what we all loved him for in the beginning.
B0002S94OS|5.0|Wow, totally awesome release, really good production work on a band that is starting to really come into its own, very tight, powerful sound that defines how far Lamb of God has come in a short time. Ashes Of The Wake could very well be metal album of the year, get it and crank it up and I think youll agree.
B00005JNJT|4.0|Batman has been brought back to full life and over powers all the rest except the fist one, because I'm still a fan of the first Batman but this one is purely fun and exciting with satisfaction written all over it. Christian Bale (American Psycho) jumps into the role as Bruce Wayne, who has had a fear of bats all his life. His father Thomas Wayne, played by actor Linus Roache (The Forgotten) and his wife were killed by a thug. Wayne grows up in the hands of Alfred Pennyworth, played superbly by Michael Caine (Get Carter). Years later the thug that killed his parents is found not guilty and is shot coming out of the court room. So, Bruce Wayne turns to the life of crime and ends up in a prison camp where later he meets a man named Henri Ducard, played nicely by Liam Neeson (Kingdom Of Heaven), who tells Bruce Wayne that he can become a \\"legend\\". So, Bruce Wayne goes to the temple of Ra's Al Ghul, played by Ken Wantanabe (The Last Samurai), and begins his training but Ra's Al Ghul has devious things in plan which Wayne doesnt want to be apart of, so Wayne fights his way out of there saving Ducard's life. So, Wayne returns from being gone 7 years and his father's company being run by another man, who is played by Rutger Hauer (Sin City). Plus, Gotham City is corrupt all over by the hands of Falcone, played with a overhammed Tom Wilkinson (Rush Hour). Wayne's childhood sweetheart Rachel, played by Katie Holmes (The Gift) is on the verge of getting rid of Falcone and his scum. Enter Dr. Jonathan Crane, played with balls by Cillian Murphy (28 Days Later), who puts on a orangish sack over his face spraying his victims with a powder substance that the victim can see what they fear....his villain name is called The Scarecrow. Soon, Wayne becomes Batman...a very buff Batman with help from his father's friend Lucious Fox, a very groovy Morgan Freeman (Million Dollar Baby) and Wayne also has the help from cop Cheif Gordon, played by Gary Oldman (State Of Grace). Soon, Wayne finds out that the baddies are trying to poison the water supply and an old friend is behind it all. Fast, fierce and exciting....much, much better then 1997's Batman and Robin which was a big disappointment with the Batman suit having nipples and Clooney's unconvincing performance. Bale makes his role his own putting a twist on it and he works it out perfectly. Also starring Mark Boone Juinor (Se7en) as Gordon's corrupt partner.

B0006L16N8|5.0|Everyone who's been critical of this CD, probably shouldn't be reviewing because this band Coldplay are here to stay. This is the 3rd CD, and for those who are completists and pick up all the CD Singles and have all the B-Sides, you'll know that their really aren't any BAD Coldplay songs. X&Y finds the UK guys, back in fine form. There aren't any bad songs, this is a rock solid soft rock CD, and I can't imagine anyone who's liked any of their songs, not to find some instant classic's here. I persaonlly like \\"A Message\\" and \\"Fix you\\". Coldplay are probably the hottest band in the world, and for good reason. They write catchy songs, they have a great front man, they put on one hell of a live show, and they appeal to a wide auidence. Do yourself a favor, and just don't be so critical of good music, sit back and enjoy this CD. There aren't any I can think of that's been released this year that are more enjoyable!
B0006L16N8|3.0|What would you expect from a band that produced songs like yellow, trouble, shiver, only superstitions, everything's not lost, til kingdom comes, the scientist, amsterdam, warning signs, and god put a smile upon your face(just to name a few of my favourites)...well nothing short of the best. <br /> <br />But sadly i'm not enjoying their latest album X&Y that much. to me it's just ok...not as stunning as Parachutes and A Rush Of Blood To The Head. Considering that it only took me just one listen of their second album, A Rush of Blood To The Head to practically embrace it.I was totally in awe with songs like green eyes, god put a smile upon your face, warning signs, daylight and amsterdam because its melody, riffs and meaningful and wonderfully sung lyrics. <br /> <br />on this album however, it's sad to see that only speed of sound has caught my attention for its liveliness (square one & fix you is ok) but to me coldplay is not about liveliness...its about lush melody, stunning riffs and great lyrics. this album to me is not great...its just good...not great. <br /> <br />but nevertheless i'm going to give my favourite band another spin and see if it will capture me like the other albums did.who knows? it might just work... <br /> <br />note:i over-heared something disturbing on the bus back from college the other day....some guy said that keane is better than coldplay!!! For the love of God i hope that it will never come true....
B00082IJ08|5.0|In a musical time when everyone is digging for buried treasure and loves someone differant I think I have found cashe of musical gold.  I was watching Mtv and saw the video to Feel Good Inc. and it brought back the good memories I had to their first self titled album.  After a week passed the feeling stayed with me and I could not get the haunting Windmill chorus out of my head so I went and bought the album.  I grew imediatly attatched and experianced no buyer remorse as I usually end up going through.  As forementioned each track is a differant experiance and sets you aflight in a surreal world of complex lyrics (raps and singing alike),and an illustrous musical landscape.  The only real miss in the bunch is white light.  The standouts include Feel Good Inc, Manana, and Dare.  This is highly recomended to anyone else looking for treasure.
B00005R1N3|1.0|This is one of the worst movies of any genre I've ever seen; and I've seen a lot of junk. The characters are unmotivated in their actions, not just simple stuff, like going into a room so the audience can shout \\"Don't go in there!\\" But police spending huge energy with a child murder loose on a obscene phone call. The father of the missing girl spending the entire movie expressionless, more interested in being a prude than a worried parent, only to faint (off camera!) at some unmotivated, forgettable remark. <br /> <br />The ending was ludicrous, totally disappointing and incomprehensibly unsatisfying. The direction was awful, from camera angles that spend time on people's backs, to horrific action that happens OFFSTAGE and thus, completely UNterrifying. The acting was mostly bad but for Andrea Martin, and the script was pure, unadulterated junk. It was badly structured, badly paced (director and/or writer can share blame), ludicrously undermotivated (people did things not because that's what their character would do, but becasue the script said to) and bafflingly bad. Why was this movie even made with a script so completely awful and lacking in craft? <br /> <br />The answer can be that this waste of film stock was obviously an attempt by Canada to launch a fledgling movie industry and was thus bankable first, and good last. Teen horror movies then, and now, were sure fire money makers, even if they were terrible and shamefully lacking in craft as this one was. Even the off cmaera Sound FX track was not only irritating, but senseless. The howling wind inside the sorority made as little sense as possible. <br /> <br />And Peter was totally without organic motivation. He was a right to lifer with passion and stupidly unrealistic sobbing because he was a piano player? If that was important, then why not make him a medical student commited to saving life, all life? His concert studies were completely unrelated to the rest of the movie. And he was such a chauvinistic pigthat he stretched credulity to the breaking point. And made Hussey's character look moronic.  <br /> <br />As a side note, while the idea of a killer creeping around and into the sanctuary of a college sorority in '74 was a good idea, why not make the sorority a reasonable victim of it's own imaturity, or past errors of judgement, or something organic? <br /> <br />Without any reason, then the entire foundation is viable only in a cinematic environment where people don't have to behave with any reason. Yes, yes. I know. Killers who slaughter young girls aren't reasonable. But if the young girls had done something to provoke him, the story would have been tighter and more plausible and therefore, more frightening to the audience. (Don't make fun of the wierd guy, he could come back and kill you and all your friends.) Bah. Humbug. Pure, unadulterated *&^*&^. <br /> <br />I don't want to insult anyone here, but the preponderance of reviews in the positive are a total mystery to me. I would recommend this movie only to people I detest or anyone with insomnia. These people should have been prevented from any further attempts at mass entertainment as they have demonstrated neither the craft or imagination to attempt it.
B000002H4C|4.0|In retrospect the album is much better than the movie.  I saw the movie many years ago and recently rented it again.  To say the least, I was disapointed.  My memory serves me wrong.  The movie really wasn't as good as I remembered but the album certainly is.  This is a killer album that still stands the test of time.  The variety of styles is very good with some truly original scores.  Sammy is still the king but has a great supporting cast.  I continue to listen to this soundtrack and still have not tired of it.
B000094J5T|5.0|I loved this movie, and I do understand why it won three Academy Awards. It is very well made, and it kept me 'glued to the screen' from beginning to end. Adrian Brody plays very well, and this film takes us through so many major events during a terrible time for the Polish Jews. <br />Now I plan to read the book that this film is based on. <br />
B000286S8S|3.0|Not a bad best of CD but the order of songs is strange.  While the Cd does have the \\"best of\\" on it, I thought there would be a clear seperation between Sam and Dave.  Having Sam singing some of Dave's songs already sung on the album is very odd.  I think I would have been happier if they just played a 60 minute version of \\"Hot for the Teacher\\".
B0006L16N8|5.0|This a great CD for any Coldplay fan.  The tracks move at a nice pace.  This is one the best CD's I have purchased in quite sometime.  The songs, \\"Twisted Logic,\\" and; \\"Speed Of Sound,\\" highlight the album.  I am 47 years old and this group has given me hope for todays music.  I like the CD because the artwork is tasteful, and gives you an insight to the music your about to have the pleasure of listening to.  This album also proves great vocals, & barebones music stylings can sell today!  I have ALL their CD's, and this adds to the pleasure of Coldplay!
B0007QJ1MK|3.0|I liked this CD the more I listened to it.  The middle section is truly terrific but the beggining and ending tracks leave something to be desired.  \\"Little Sister\\" is certainly the best song on the CD.  I also felt something may have been borrowed from another band.   \\"I never Came\\" sounds suspiciously like \\"Like a Stone\\" from Audioslave [without the high notes].
0064400557|5.0|It was sad when Charlotte died and the pig was lonely.  I think people 7 and up should read this book.
B000002NG7|5.0|Finally an album where every song is good or great.  This band did not get the recognition they deserved for this piece of work; it is truly great.  Maybe the title of the album was a little much.  In this case though, the title matches the content.  This Cd is really the best of the band, they were at their prime when they made it.
B0006SSOHM|1.0|I believe this film had promise--at least in the beginning however it quickly descends into a horrific mess with tons of plot holes and a premise that is just shy of absurd.  Danny Glover is totally wasted and it's hard to believe he even did this movie.  Avoid.
0679805273|5.0|The reality-based advice in this book partners well with the fantasy-filled illustrations in teaching people -- of any age -- how to cope gracefully with life's ups and downs, and that slumps, lurches, and waiting places happen to every Tom, Dick, and Carlos, and everyone is bound to be scared right out of their pants at some point, but if you don't give up, you'll GO SOMEWHERE! Great for preschoolers, graduates, newlyweds, businessfolk, cancer patients, new parents, people doing weight management, and people recovering from great sorrow -- hey, great for anyone, from 4 to 100.
B00003CXXP|5.0|While this film has many polarizing aspects that people will either love or hate, the most commonly sited criticism is that Spielberg ruined Kubricks vision by inserting an overly sentimental ending.  The truth is, Kubrick was responsible for the majority of the films script, especially the beginning and end.  Most of what Spielberg wrote was the middle, and very dark, portion of the film. <br /> <br />No matter who wrote it, however, the ending is not simply a happy ending.  In fact, even a little thought reveals that it is probably the darkest ending Spielberg has ever directed.  The audience isn't supposed to feel happy that David is reunited with his mother, who suddenly loves him.  The ending is intentionally very artificial, and the \\"love\\" Monica demonstrates toward David rings hollow. <br /> <br />I interpret it as Monica being simply a creation of the advanced mechas that rescued David.  Like David, the new Monica is simply an artificial creation meant to fulfill his need for love.  The lesson of this film is not a hopeful one.  It is meand to raise doubts in our minds as to whether love is anything more than a chemical reaction that can be replicated by computers.  The final image of David laying beside his now dead mother may seem happy on the surface because of the narration and warm sunset, but it is actually a dark and fitting conclusion to this underrated masterpiece about love and what it means to be human.
0634049011|5.0|I can't believe I'm rating something 5 stars, but this book deserves it. This book along with - \\"Understanding How to Build Guitar Chords and Arpeggios\\" by Michael Policastro are the two worthy of being called \\"logical\\", while others that call themselves that are not. <br /> <br />Once you finish these books, you may move on to Giuliani's opus 48 etudes to build your sightreading skills.
0553582461|5.0|I loved reading the Farseer Trilogy, despite the fact that upon its completion I wasn't at all satisfied with what had happened to its main characters. I was hoping that with this final installment, there would be a proper (and perhaps happy?!) ending. <br /> <br />I won't summarize the book, but here are a few of my thoughts. <br />I didn't enjoy reading some of the pages Hobb used to describe the party's journey to Aslevjal. I found myself rushing through these pages and slowing down once they reached the island.  But the scenes that DO occur on the island are some of the best I've read from any of Hobb's series. Practically EVERYONE is involved somehow in the final scene on the island. Hobb also throws in quite a few surprises here.  <br /> <br />After this major finale, Hobb spends the rest of the book neatly \\"tidying\\" up each character's fate. And she spends quite a few pages doing so. I believe that this was totally necessary, given that this is the conclusion to an epic series.  <br /> <br />In the end I wasn't at all satisfied with what happened to the Fool. Hobb didn't truly reveal his eventual fate, unlike the other characters. But given the mystery that always surrounded the Fool, I suppose this was approrpriate. But Hobb DID finally give Fitz and every other character an appropriate end.  <br /> <br />In conclusion, a great ending for this series!
B00006JSS8|5.0|The craftsmanship of  Stevie Wonder certainly obligates us to get back on our ancient memories. In the febrile turbulence of new forms of expression in the middle of the sixties, the British invasion through the Beatles displaced Elvis from the top of the Billboard, the rock movement literally defined the feature of raising American bands. But the racial tensions penetrated the intimate feeling of the black people who literally had built a refugee in the jazz music: in this ambits they were the kings: Dizzy Gillespie, Billie Halliday, Charlie Parker, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Charles Mingus, Wes Montgomery opened the Gates and somehow narrowed the distances and the feeling and the whole world acknowledgement for their undeniable talent. The Soul music precisely derivates from a complex variety of fusions; Latin music brought Tito Puente, Mongo Santamaria and Carl Tjader were the pioneers. The Soul knows about Wilson Pickett, Smokey Robinson, Otis Reading, Diana Ross, The Supremes and Temptations, allows the creation of Motown records; and in this state of things Stevie Wonder appears and his immense talent has allowed him to survive to ten generations, he possesses this special smell to feel the fashion musical and innovate and reinventing himself to remain always fresh and renovated. I think in so many young couples who meet and fell in love with My cherry amour, for instance, married and then his sons grow up under Isn't she is lovely? Or Superstitious beats to become in teenagers to complete the cycle with Ribbon in the sky (his best and most complete song to my mind) or the famous \\"I just called to say I love you\\". He owns this touch of genius who maintains him active. Consider the cases of three remarkable singers as Edwin Star in the last sixties,  Bill Whiters in the middle seventies and Lionel Ritchie in the eighties. They were famous but belonged to a decade. That is the real difference with Wonder<br /><br />His songs always transmit optimistic mood even talking about sad issues, and his undeniable charisma have become in a true legend.s always transmit optimistic mood even talking about sad issues, and his undeniable charisma have become in a true legend.                 <br />
B0009HLDFU|5.0|I'm tired of hearing all this complaining about copy protection.  This album is awesome, and plays well on my computer and transferred very easily to my Ipod.  Sounds like there's a lot of people out there who bought an expensive toy that they have no idea how to use.  Maybe you should take some time to learn how to use your Ipod to avoid sounding like idiots in the future.
B00005JNJT|3.0|Script felt like it belonged to a second THE SHADOW movie.  <br />Then got warmed over for Batman. <br /> <br />Worth seeing? If you love comic book movies. <br />Any good? Not bad. Could've been much better. <br /> <br />Bruce existed. Batman barely did. <br />The Morgan Freeman character was not a character, just a function. <br />The Alfred character was not a character, just a functionary. <br />The \\"girl\\" character had some substance. <br />Most characters were not characters, just bodies to make things happen. <br /> <br />1989 Batman had a far better Danny Elfman score (with humor).  <br />1989 Batman had a spirit this one at least tried to caoture. <br />1989 Zatoichi had editing technique used here for fight scenes. (You'd see a raised arm. You'd hear a scuffle. You'd see shadows. Then someone would be down.) You'd never actually see a fight. <br /> <br />But then that now-ya-see-it-now-ya-don't quality was the creative thrust of the whole movie. Which made it far less satisfying and involving than it might have been. <br /> <br />Carmine Falcone represented the corruption of Gotham, meaning of [name your favorite city] and this was meaningful. He was, however, neither an exaggerated comic character nor a realistic one, but a stereotype nonetheless. Identifying this form of evil was worthwhile. <br /> <br />Despite emotional characters, there was no emotion in the movie. <br /> <br />Oh yes: Some great comic book \\"splash panels,\\" mostly at the end.  <br /> <br />And the ending might imply or build demand for a sequel. I think it suggested a full circle return to the content of the 1989 Batman. A good idea. Hollywood just does not trust us so they do sequels that never equal the intensity or creative impulses of the original. They futz with them and end up with more explosions and less story. <br /> <br />I think there was a fine movie in there somewhere that, in all the years since the last Batman movie, got dumbed down.

B00005JNJT|5.0|When the fourth film to feature D.C. Comics' character \\"Batman\\" was unveiled in 1997 (entitled \\"Batman and Robin\\"), it certainly seemed that the \\"Batman\\" film franchise had forever died as it was an atrocious film.  When announcements were made public that a new \\"Batman\\" film would be released in 2005 (entitled \\"Batman Begins\\"), I certainly had my doubts that the film would be good following the 1997 disaster.  However, director and co-writer Christopher Nolan, who directed and co-wrote the Oscar-nominated film \\"Memento\\" in 2000, has happily proven my doubts wrong.  \\"Batman Begins\\" is, in my opinion, the best \\"Batman\\" film ever produced thanks to a combination of superb direction, wonderful acting and an engaging story.<br /><br />Beginning when Bruce Wayne is only eight years old (played by Gus Lewis), Bruce accidentally falls into a pit on the very wealthy Wayne Manor.  He is rescued by his father Thomas Wayne (Linus Roache), who is a philanthropist that prefers to let others manage Wayne Enterprises, but Bruce's experience and memories of being in the pit torment him into his adult years with horrifying dreams of the bats that inhabit the pit and its adjoining cave.  It is not long after his rescue that he attends an opera with his father and mother (Sara Stewart).  When performers dressed in black remind him of the bats, he urges his parents to leave, which they do with him through a back door into an adjoining alley.  There, a petty thief kills Bruce's parents: an act that, like the bats, will haunt Bruce into his adult years.  It is also on that horrific night that Bruce first meets a Gotham City police officer by the name of Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman).  With Wayne Enterprises under the watchful eye of Earle (Rutger Hauer), the Wayne family butler Alfred (Michael Caine) takes on the responsibility of raising Bruce.  As an adult still haunted by bats and the murder of his parents, Bruce (Christian Bale) attempts to understand the criminal mind by disappearing and living as a petty thief himself.  Arrested in Asia, he is discovered by an unusual man named Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) that offers him a better alternative to coming to terms with his past and his fears.  Released from prison, Bruce travels to a distant and highly secretive monastery where he is directed to pick a blue flower.  He does so and is accepted by the monastery's leader named Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe).  There, Bruce learns various martial arts techniques and slowly comes to terms with his fears, but when he is asked by Ra's Al Ghul to carry out deeds that would grant him full status in the monastery's shadowy group, he refuses.  This refusal and the subsequent actions alienate Bruce from the shadowy group, so he returns to Wayne Manor.  However, having overcome his fears, Bruce returns to the pit and finds the adjoining bat-infested cave and decides that like his father who helped Gotham City, it is his duty to help rid Gotham City of the crime and corruption that dominates it at every conceivable level; but can he? You'll just have to watch this exciting film to find out!<br /><br />With its stark realism, attention to detail, dark cinematography, wonderful cast, collage of interesting characters and plot twists, \\"Batman Begins\\" is sure to keep its audience entertained and fully engaged with its 141 minutes.  Other wonderfully portrayed characters include the godfather-like criminal leader Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson), former Wayne Enterprise board member Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), attorney and long-time friend of Bruce named Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) and the corrupt psychiatrist Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy).  Overall, I rate \\"Batman Begins\\" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.nd living as a petty thief himself.

B000957O82|2.0|On the surface the message of \\"Hitch\\" is you can't predict love. There are no rules, you just have to go out there and be yourself and if you do that you will find everyone has a special someone out there waiting to be found.<br /><br /> But I've seen this movie before and the most memorable example is the 1972 Herbert Ross film based on Woody Allen's stage play \\"Play It Again, Sam\\". In that movie Allen wants to be Humphrey Bogart, who is suppose to be the epitome of cool. Allen thinks if he can act more like somone else, and less like himself he will get the girl.<br /><br /> Fastforward, it's now 2005 and most people don't know who Humphrey Bogart is so they now look to Alex \\"Hitch\\" Hitchens (Will Smith) who is a \\"date doctor\\". He coaches men on how to be cool. He tells them all the rules of dating.<br /><br /> I wonder though if underneath the surface there is another message being sent out. Will Smith is an African-American actor who has a great amount of box-office success. Maybe he wasn't chosen for the part merely because of his appeal. In our society we tend to think the black culture is also the epitome of cool. Only black men can act suave and sweep the ladies off their feet. Only they know how to dress or dance whereas white men are seen as nerds. Notice how nearly all of Hitch's clients are white males. I realize I'm thinking outside the box here, but don't be so quick to dismiss the casting decisions made in this movie. I realize Hollywood at times seems as if it doesn't have a brain but just think about it the images you are seeing and what exactly they mean in relation to society.<br /><br /> But most people who watch this movie may not even think about it terms of its social ramification so lets talk about it as if it had no hidden agenda.<br /><br /> Alex Hitchens was not always the \\"date doctor\\" as a flashback shows us. In college he was quite unpopular until one day he fell in love with Cressida (Robinne Lee). He thought she was the love of his life and he made sure to repeatedly tell her he loves her to which she would appear uncomfortable. Alex then catches Cressida cheating on him, breaking his heart. He now vows he will never have another man go through what he did again. So he decides he will help men get the women of their dreams.<br /><br /> Albert (Kevin James) is an accountant who is in love with Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta), one of the clients his firm handles. She doesn't even know he exist and so he seeks out Hitch.<br /><br /> Hitch thinks Albert his hopeless but sticking true to his vow agrees to help him out anyway. Albert though does nothing but stumble over things and knock things over. But I just found it annoying. Sure Woody Allen has made a career out of it, but I've never heard, even from Allen's critics, somone describe what he does as predictable and juvenile. I can not say the same thing for Kevin James.<br /><br /> Now while Hitch is helping Albert get the girl of his dreams, Hitch meets a gossip columnist Sara (Eva Mendes). Sara is shown as a cold bitter person who has some issues, that sadly are never fully explored in this movie, and seems to have sworn off men. She claims they always disappoint her. We soon realize she was just waiting for Hitch to come along. But when Hitch is with her he doesn't seem to be playing his game right. He stumbles, says the wrong thing, and even gets food poisoning.<br /><br /> The movie then becomes a guessing game of whether or not Albert will get Allegra in the end? Will Allegra find out about Hitch? Will Hitch get Sara and will she ever find out about who he really is?<br /><br /> If you're over five who should be able to guess the answers to these questions and that's pretty much the problem with this movie. Everythng happens exactly the way it is suppose to happens. Nothing new or different is done here. It strickly follows the formula of movies before it. And I thought it was all done without any big laughs.<br /><br /> Now a movie like \\"Hitch\\" I guess is pretty hard to actually hate it. I didn't have a bad physical reaction to it but I don't think I would want to watch it again. It is not a great movie and quite frankly I'm surprised at the reaction this movie is getting on Amazon. But this movie is not worth your time.<br /><br /> Okay, so if by some small miricle I've convinced you not to see this movie you're asking yourself then what should I go out and see. Well in theaters there is Paul Haggis' \\"Crash\\", and if you like animation, and even if you don't, please, please, please go see \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" and I also recommend \\"Cinderella Man\\" and the new \\"Star Wars\\" movie. On DVD you have Sean Penn giving one of his best performances in \\"The Assassination of Richard Nixon\\" and Kevin Bacon in \\"The Woodsman\\" and on a lighter note the Alain Renais French musical\comedy \\"Not on the Lips\\".<br /><br /> Bottom-line: Disappointing formula driven romantic\comedy that just isn't all that funny. Kevin James starts to get a bit annoying and the movie just bails on Eva Mendes as it leads us to think there is some secret about her past and a particular man that may have hurt her.it but I don't think I would want to watch it again.

B000002BQK|5.0|What a landmark album in music.  Mariah has freed herself from the ties that bind.  Way to go Mariah.  And the music tells the story.  Butterfly was a completely underated music event in Mariah's career.  Some were threatened by her new sexy image.  Some were threatened by her love of hiphop music.  Some were just pure haters.  Mariah truly blossomed into women hood on this 1997 album.  She revealed a more personal and real side of her personality that was being held back for purposes well known.  Job well done.........
B00005JNJT|3.0|This is a new direction for the Batman franchise. Forget all about the 40's & 60's style Batman, and also, forget about the direction Tim Burton took it in the 80's & 90's. <br /> <br />Batman has been re-worked, re-thought, re-sculpted, and pretty much all that remains from the other Batmans is charactors names. So forget all you have come to be familliuer with in the Batman sagas, and accept this movie as starting a fresh new approach that obviously will start a chain reaction of sequels to come. <br /> <br />The movie kicks off alternating between past, present and in between. It shows how Bruce Wayne discovered the Batcave, how his parents died, what they did for a living, and what his role is now. Bruce wants to stop the corruption plauging Gothem City, but isnt strong enough. He ventures to Asia (I think) and trys to teach himself how to be tough, and then finds his way into a monk style ninja training place (I dunno, something like that) but then Bruce wants to use his new skills for good, not assasantion. He returns to Gothem and finds that his company have a warehouse filled with gadjets and weopens that the army never wanted to use or where just too expensive to market... and so Bruce, with the help of a new friend (Morgan Freeman) slowly build up into Batman. As well as the help from his butler Alfred played by Michael Caine. <br /> <br />The new approach is a little confusing when you have seen the other Batmans and this movie is doing something different. I was kind of distracted with the thought that it's not the Joker who kills Bruces parents...and alot of those things with a familuer feel have been altered... but thats why you have to forget everything you previosly knew about the dark knight. <br /> <br />The new direction is not bad, and it's a bit more believable then past Batmans... at least to the questions of why Bruce does what he does, and how he has so much money to do so... and of coarse, where the gadjets come from. <br /> <br />This filmwont win a best actor award, but it's entertaining and never dull. But now that Batman has been reborn with a new formula, look for alot of sequels coming in the future.
B00008EYA5|4.0|This was a good action flick but I felt that there was nobody encouraging eachother on the SWAT team or anybody doing anything or saying anything with heart.  The film was one of the best action films out there though and I did like the scene where the young swat memebers are training to be on the team.  The end of the movie is pretty cool and Samuel L. Jackson played a great leader for the SWAT team just like he was a great coach on Coach Carter.  When guns or bombs go off the sourround sound is exhilirating.  The commentary was dissapointing though.  Buy it if you like action flicks.  God bless you and America.
B0000TB01Y|2.0|So after not being able to finish the book because it was so boring to me I listened to the music from this musical and read the whole synopsis.  Actually it sounded like an interesting story and the music was at times stunning.  However I would often find myself laughing at it for all it tried to be.  It seemed almost like every song had to be a power ballad just to prove it was a good musical and ever song could be a hit.  It didn't succeed.  It just doesn't have the magic that some musicals have.  \\"For Good\\" was the only song I thought was stunning and came close to those moments others musicals have that everything is just seems so unearthly and amazing.  Other than that it is good, just not unbelievable like Sound of Music, Big River, The Phantom of the Opera, Lion King...it's just not in the ranks with those.
B000929AJQ|3.0|This album is an enjoyable listen, but it still feels a little empty coming from the man who brought us giant panoramic albums like The Fragile. This album feels like it should've came out after The Downward Spiral, or at least a year or two after The Fragile. I don't see how or why it took six years for it to come out. It sounds slightly below average for Nine Inch Nails. On it's own, it's a pretty enjoyable album. There are some good moody electronic-tinged songs like All The Love In The World (which turns Motown near the end.) and then there is the commercial rock that is The Hand That Feeds and You Know Who You Are.<br /><br />The problem first of all is that there isn't anything new on here. It's all been done before on previous works like Downward Spiral and Broken. This would be fine if it was released a few years ago, but this is 2005. Trent has to push his genre forward if he's going to take extended breaks from music. With Teeth sounds like it only took a few months to make. Also, what is up with the pathetic lyrics? Trent, you're 40 years old. You're not the angry young man you used to be. Seriously, if someone is this angry over the course of a lfetime, they need serious mental health.<br /><br />Anyway, old fans of NIN might be dissapointed. New fans should pick this up, and then go with The Downward Spiral. I, on the other hand, will be spinning The Fragile for years to come.
0688170528|4.0|I also could not put this book down, but also found it disturbing.  I liked how the author used stories or flashbacks from the past in order to cement information that was happening in the \\"present.\\"  What I took away from the story is that Emily and Chris did love each other and at some point Emily did not feel that that love was enough.  What I find somewhat alarming is that Emily did not have the kind of parents that were overly affectionate with each other, so that is possibly why did didn't feel that she could speak to either about her problems with sex or her feelings for Chris.  I also find it alarming that neither Chris or Emily were expected to be friends with anyone else.  I am not a parent but I personally would find it strange if my son/daughter only \\"played\\" with one person and I would perhaps encourage them to branch out to other people.  I much admit that once I was finished (and as this review probably shows) I blamed the parents (both Chris' and Emily's) for what happened.  I commend the aurthor for writing a book that I found haunting, sad, yet real.  I found the book hard to finish but I felt that I needed to finish it.  All in all I think it is a book worth reading.
B0000028VT|5.0|This album was more of a phenomonon (did i spell that right) for Mariah's career.  To date it is her biggest selling album ever.  The music continues to satisfy the fans as she sings her heart out.  Of course the hits Dreamlover and Hero are included here but sometimes you need look past the #1 hits and check out the other songs like Never Forget You and All I Ever Wanted.  This cd will satisfy any ballad thirsty music fan.
B00005JNJT|5.0|This ain't your father's Batman, But this movie is fully charged! Long before the sillyness of the '60s action tv show, or the darkness of the first 2 Bat-Films(Both starred Michael Keaton, and directed by Tim Burton). This movie shows the origins of the caped crusader. From the time Bruce Wayne's parents were found murdered to the man who inherited the Wayne Industries' legacy, From the Extensive training from his mentor, Jacques Ducard (Liam Neeson)to Getting all of the gadgetry from Luscious Fox(Morgan Freeman), This Batman is ready to take on Gotham's Baddest Meanies, Including, in this movie, The ScareCrow. He does'nt have Robin, does'nt climb walls ,and does'nt have BatGirl. But when there's the signal, He's ready. Christian Bale was the right guy to play Batman, and He'll be Back. So will the Dark Knight.  \\"Wait till they get a load of me!!!\\" Jack Nicholson as The Joker \\"Batman\\" 1989
B000031EGV|5.0|Robin Williams has some funny movies but my top two favorite are Mrs. Doubtfire and Jumanji.  Jumanji is funnier and better.  Bonnie Hunt really played her part well and was funny.  A young Kirsten Dunst I think did a better performance in this one then in the firtst Spiderman movie.  Bradley Pierce did good for an actor that I had never heard of before.  Joe Johnston made some great special effects.  The cop was funny and I think it was cool how Robin Williams hand cuffed him because he was os shocked to see Robin alive.  The weird guy from a long time ago with the gun made this film really entertaining.  Great family fun so buy it.   Also may I add this had titanical sourround sound.  God bless you and have the greatest day in your entire life and God bless America.  <br />
B0000A118M|5.0|The John Coltrane Quartet in A Love Supreme is composed of John Coltrane on tenor saxophone, McCoy Tyner on piano, Jimmy Garrison on bass, and Elvin Jones on drums.    John Coltrane's music is kind of like spicy food. Some people love spicy food and others cannot stand it. You just have to have the taste for it. So, with that in mind, this album might not be for every person, even a jazz lover.     If there is any fault in this album, it is the suite's extreme complexity. Coltrane's highly improvised and somewhat exploratory style of creating melodies might be hard on some listeners' ears. This is definitely not a CD for New Age music!     This CD does however have many high points. Coltrane's technical flourishes and great tenor tone adds a lot of colour to the melodic lines. The piano solos by McCoy Tyner are excellent and greatly complement Coltrane's playing. Tyner's fingers sure can fly. Also, Tyner's piano comping goes great with the rhythm section. The CD also features a bass introduction on Part II: Resolution and a bass solo ending on Part III: Pursuance by Jimmy Garrison. This is a rare treat because bass solos are not extremely common. Elvin Jones does a spectacular job on this album. His cymbal work is excellent with a great Chinese tam-tam (gong) introduction to Part I: Acknowledgement, which is very unique. Jones's background work on the kit is just a work of art. His use of the drum set, from the cymbals, the snare, and toms, to back Coltrane's sax is something meant to be studied. His drums solos are exquisite.     In 1957, John Coltrane became a Christian. A Love Supreme was Coltrane's way of praising God and giving Him credit for which He is due. John Coltrane's aim for A Love Supreme was, as he put it, \\"a humble offering to Him. An attempt to say \\"Thank You God\\" through our work, even as we do in our hearts and with our tongues. May He help and strengthen all men in every good endeavour.\\"      If you like John Coltrane's music, this is a must-havealbum. If you are a saxophonist in search of a player that demonstrates great technical ability and a little \\"exploration\\" on his instrument, look no further than this. If you want a rhythm section that does a lot more than just keep time, get this CD. If you are looking for a heartfelt, improvised jazz album, A Love Supreme is for you.       Total Playing Time: 32:48  Total Tracks: 4  Originally Recorded on December 9, 1964 at Van Gelder Recording Studio, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey by Impulse Records
B00004RE7C|4.0|The oft-quoted rule that has even-numbered Trek movies beating odd-number movies was never that convincing - and this flick proves it wrong.  <br /> <br />Picking up at the moment where \\"Wrath of Khan\\" left off, \\"Search\\" has Spock's coffin soft landing on the Genesis planet. Dr. Marcus and Saavik return to their to investigate that world's development. Meanwhile, the badly damaged Enterprise returns to Earth where Captain Kirk learns the ship is to be scrapped. When Dr. McCoy begins showing signs that he was \\"mind-melded\\" with Spock - thinking he actually is Spock - he tries to get a ship back to the Genesis planet where Spock's body was left. (In a scene that sends up the cantina scene from the first Star Wars flick, McCoy tries getting a ride with an alien who bears a resemblance to the Vorvon from \\"Buck Rogers\\"). Kirk, informed by Spock's father Sarek that both McCoy and Spock's body must be returned to Vulcan, tries to get to Genesis himself, even though Starfleet has quarantined the planet. Meanwhile, Kruge (Christopher Lloyd), a rogue Klingon warlord with his own ship and crew, penetrates federation space greedy for the secrets of Genesis.  <br /> <br />Though this flick seems a bit abbreviated - filler between \\"Khan\\" and \\"Voyage Home\\" it's not only a lot of fun, but a great example of how good Trek can be. The script has our heroes working outside Starfleet regulations and having loads of fun with each other. Prime examples: Scott explains how he saboutaged the Excelsior to McCoy, dropping that ship's isolinear chips into McCoy's palm like spare change (\\"From one Doctor to another, when you've learnt how to clean the pipes, you know how to stop the drain\\"). Kirk, when meeting up with the Spock-possessed McCoy holds his hand up in the Vulcan salute, asking the Doctor \\"how many fingers am I holding up\\"; and let's not forget that magic moment when Bones tries to give a Starfleet Security the Vulcan neck-pinch. Laughs aside, the script is tight and sticks with its central theme of pulling life from death - epitomized by the rescue of Spock and the awesome self-destruction of the Enterprise. Christopher Lloyd's Klingon was underused, but he showed some potential. The special effects beat anything I've seen on the Next-Generation movies and the script makes the characters seem a whole lot livelier. If you've put off this flick because this was an odd-numbered Trek movie, think again and give it a try.
B000002AVF|5.0|At this point Mariah was like the energizer bunny.  This cd marks the time when Mariah started encorporating hints of hiphop into her music.  What a nice blend of pop, r&b, hiphop, and pure soul.  This cd also spawned the landmark single FANTASY featuring the late O.D.B.  This song would be the blueprint for alot of future divas to follow.  Mariah hit the mark first so let's keep that in mind.   A more introspective mariah emerges on this cd with the song Looking In.  And of course this cd contains the Super Hit ONE SWEET DAY featuring Boys To Men... <br />This cd is an all around winner.....
B00068NVI4|5.0|Hey all.  This DVD will be great, no matter the delay.  When your done listening to it head on over to  <br /> <br />[...] <br /> <br />and talk about it and all other things Yes.
B000000OF6|4.0|Queen was an amzing an remarkable band that joined opera and rock together and made their music pure art.  Freddie Mercury had the greatest voice of all time and that is what made the band so popular and not strange.  We Will rock you is a song you will here at a ball game you go to just like Gary Glitter's rock and roll pt2.  We are the champions really made Freddy's voice famous and the same with the killer Queen.  I would have not really wanted to buy their greatest hits 1 and 2 but they had Boheiman Rhapasody and Radio Ga Ga on the second Greatest hits so I had to.  Boheiman Rhapasody is in the top ten songs of all time.  You got to love it when Freddy sings one part in that song where he goes \\"Mama\\".  That song has just so many different things in it like one minute you hear an electric guitar and then the next minute you hear opera.  Way to cool.  Youre my best friend has a good tune and makes you feel good.  Another one bites the dust is the song for the early eighties because it;'s got great sounds in it.  Bicycle race was different because it got into politics and what was going on in the world.  Underpressure is a song that I will never forget because a long time ago I heard it and that is what got me into this band.  Forget trying to catch these great songs on classic rock radio stations or even Sirus satelite radio, buy their greatest hits 1 and 2 and you will not be dissapointed.  God bless you and have a great day.
0140177396|5.0|\\"The best-laid schemes o' mice an 'men <br />Gang aft agley, <br />An'lea'e us nought but grief an' pain, <br />For promis'd joy!\\" <br /> <br />-Robert Burns, \\"To A Mouse, On Turning Her Up In Her Nest With The Plough\\" <br /> <br />Lennie and George, the two main characters in John Steinbeck's post-depression era novel, Of Mice and Men, hold to the \\"promised joy\\" that they will someday be able to live out their days on an idyllic farm. Steinbeck's terse, strong narrative style confronts the reader from the very beginning that the men's dream will not come true. <br /> <br />Spanning only the course of a few days, the novel is stunning in its beauty, despair, and tragedy. Steinbeck's foreshadowing of Lennie's death (by the killing of the old dog) is masterful and disturbing. <br /> <br />Readers who enjoyed Grapes of Wrath will be surprised at this stripped-down novel, which runs only about 100 pages; it captures much the same sentiment, but on a smaller and more intimate scale. <br /> <br />Even after you put the book down, you'll never be able to forget the characters.
B00005G8NH|4.0|Apple has a great voice and talent and proves that on \\"When the Pawn\\".  This is a record you can listen to from start to finish and not be bored.  Is it better than \\"Tidal\\"? No, but it isn't because of lack of trying on Apple's part. There doesn't seem to be any songs that stand out for me on \\"When the Pawn\\".  It doesn't mean the songs are bad, but their not as memorable as the songs like \\"Criminal\\" from \\"Tidal\\". Get this record if you are an Apple fan, she doesn't disappoint.
B000002A46|5.0|Anyone who loves Christmas music will have to add this cd to their holiday music collection.  Mariah sings Christmas classics in classic Mariah style but also wrote a new Christmas classic herself entitled ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS.  Even if you are not a Mariah fan and you love Christmas music this might be the one mariah cd you will own.  After that then maybe you'll come around.  This cd has been a  Christmas tradition in our house since it's debut in 1994 and it always will be.
B0002Z0EXQ|4.0|This film is not perfect but then what film is? But as a Teacher its a great way to introduce my students to that Windy Hill in Asia Minor. One gets the feel of those distant times and the problems that they faced. Most of my students take the side of Hector over the rest of the Mob. I shall not repeat what they think of Paris or Helen. (To put it nicely they would of been thrown over the side before reaching Troy)
B0009HLDFU|5.0|I recieved In Your Honor as a gift and instead of looking this gift horse in the mouth, I ignored the \\"copy protection\\" lable on the front and pumped the cd into my Mac. The CD ran PERFECTLY, not to mention ran with clarity on my ipod.  <br />I've seen about 50, 1 star reviews from people who actually liked the album but couldn't get over the \\"supposed\\" non rippable disc. <br /> I personally would buy the Foo for whatever they produce so my opinion either way shouldnt sway you, but to be deterred by copy protected disc is infantile and just plain wrong.  <br />Let the quality of the songs be the basis of your reviews people.These are reviews for songs, not the money hungry lables! On that note. DOA and the Deepest Blues are Black of their rock album are fantastic. The acoustic disc (the one with the backside of a buffalo as album art) is inspired and would be hardpressed not to with guest apperances by Zepplin's John Paul Jones and Norah Jones ( who's duet with Dave on \\"Virginia Moon\\" is, in this reviewers eyes, makes for best song on the acousitc side)
B000002UAX|4.0|No, I don't love every song on this album.  There are a lot of clunkers, but the last thing I would want is for George Martin to have cut the White Album down to a single record.<br /><br />Many intrepid Amazon reviewers offer their potential White-Album-as-a-single-album trackslists, with a couple standards (Revolution 1 and While My Guitar...) and lots of variety.  Some want to ax songs that others desperately want to keep.  Others want to keep songs that are almost universally panned.  There's really no clear consensus.  My personal favorite track from the album (and probably my favorite overall Beatles track) is \\"Savoy Truffle,\\" a George Harrison song that surely would have gotten cut had the White Album been shrunk. I also enjoyed the song \\"Wild Honey Pie,\\" and for people to grade this song as if it were intended to be a musical masterpiece in the vein of \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" is a bit ridiculous.  Both Casablanca and Dumb and Dumber were great movies, but they were great in their own way.  Not every piece of art is _trying_ to be the greatest piece of art, and no one was trying to pass off \\"Why Don't We Do It In The Road\\" as anything but a cheeky tune.  So all the attacks on the song ring a bit hollow.<br /><br />So why want to shrink the album?  Outside of pressing the skip button, you don't lose anything (maybe a calorie from moving your arm?).  Yeah, you have to pay for a double album, but if it's any consolation it will look good on your CD rack.  But seriously, if it were compressed, many people (including myself) would have lost their favorite songs.  Too much Beatles is not a bad thing.  Too little, however, is a travesty.  The Beatles' career was too short to have needed major editing.  I'm sure the Rolling Stones could have saved up tracks and released them in a few years, but the Beatles didn't have that luxury.  Their reign was short but sweet.<br /><br />Although most point to the extreme number of songs as the fatal flaw of the White Album, I think its eccentricities and scattered ways make it great.  I can definitely understand why people don't like this album, but everyone can find something they love about it.<br /><br />My favorite 12 tracks (and it was hard):<br /><br />Back in the USSR<br />Dear Prudence<br />While My Guitar Gently Weeps<br />Martha My Dear<br />Blackbird<br />Why Don't We Do It In the Road<br />I Will<br />Birthday<br />Helter Skelter<br />Honey Pie<br />Savoy Truffle<br />Revolution 1<br /><br />If your favorite track isn't on there, be glad that I (or anyone else) wasn't able to edit the album content.I think its eccentricities and scattered ways make it great.

B0001AP12G|4.0|Kanye's debut album is something that hip-hop has needed for awhile.The rapper/producer has some great knowledge and can rap about it with a lot of creativity and a great flow and well since its Kanye he has his killer beats to back him up.The only bad thing about this cd is the skits and i know everyone agrees with that.The odd skit is all right but Kanye has 2 many on this cd although they do at least fit in and has something to do with the next song on the album.\\"Never Let Me Down\\" and \\"Get Em High\\" are great songs.Never Let Me Down has 2 great verses from Mr.Jay-Z and is an inspiring song.Get Em High has a killer beat with 3 great verses from Kanye,Mos Def and one of the G.O.A.T's Talib Kweli.This album was the album of the year in 2004 and Kanye's new cd \\"Late Registration\\"could be another classic.

B0007Y08IS|4.0|Team America is a crude, bizarre and militantly un-PC look at the War on Terror. The technique of the film, using puppets whose strings are clearly visible throughout the movie, is a study in itself. The obvious suggestion, whether intended or not, is that all of the players in today's global situation, from terrorists to gung-ho American military types to peace activists, are basically puppets acting out mindless roles. Despite its humor, Team America presents an extremely cynical view of the world. Nor is it, contrary to the opinions of some critics, without a clear-cut ideology. While both the ultra-macho Team America and the left wing peace activists are sharply satirized, the film clearly comes out in favor of Team America, who end up saving the world. The hero, actor Gary Johnston, delivers a crudely funny speech at the end which actually presents a surprisingly coherent, and nearly persuasive justification for American foreign policy. In fact, I would have to say that it is the best defense of this policy that I have seen or heard thus far, though I should confess I am no fan of Bush and recent wars. This gives me a grudging admiration for the movie --that in the midst of its absurdity and gross-out humor, it actually does a better job of explaining current military policy than our so-called leaders and most of the mass media. To summarize, without using the film's obscene language (which would be unprintable in any case), the argument is that America is violent, responsible for much destruction (in the movie, Team America blows up, among other things, the Eiffel Tower and the Sphinx) and basically amoral, but the terrorists who it opposes are far worse. Where this film succeeds in defending this rather simplistic doctrine, while politicians and media columnists fail, is the extent to which the movie scours its heroes. Instead of John Wayne and American Flags waving to the sound of sappy patriotic music, we get a bumbling military team headed by a closet homosexual, while the patriotic music in the background is a vulgar rock and roll number.<br /><br />  Team America does have notable weaknesses. The left-wing Hollywood actors (who belong to the Film Actors Guild, or F.A.G. --Team America is hardly above high school humor) are parodied beyond any degree of credibility. They are essentially portrayed as idiots who can barely speak a full sentence, while Michael Moore turns out to be a bomb-wielding terrorist. This complete lack of any subtlety betrays a lack of confidence and imagination on the part of the filmmakers. There are certainly enough valid ways to satirize self-righteous Hollywood activists without parodying them beyond all recognition.<br /><br />  One thing that is interesting about Team America is that it ends up subverting its own position (which, for all I know, may have been the filmmakers' real intention). While it does make a strangely convincing argument that the world needs the kind of shoot-now-ask-questions-later sort of heroes portrayed in the film, it also provokes some seriously subversive questions, at least for anyone who is able to think beyond the South Park mentality of the movie's surface. If the spirit of Team America is akin to the actual soul of modern America, what does that say about how far we have strayed from the ideals upon which this country is supposed to be based? Some critics, such as Roger Ebert, have attacked the movie's nihilism. As I see it, the film is actually reflecting a nihilistic spirit that is very much a part of today's political landscape. If a cartoonish movie, seemingly aimed at teenagers, comes closer to revealing the true nature and intentions of our leaders, uttering truths that more serious commentators would never dare to, isn't that something that needs to be addressed? If a violent, amoral nihilism lies at the heart of today's society, we should not blame moviemakers for showing it to us. Team America, if nothing else, does us a service in this regard. Plus, to be honest, it's just plain funny.egard. Plus, to be honest, it's just plain funny.
B00005JNJT|5.0|I loved this movie. \\"Batman Begins\\" has done something other movies have failed to do in my opinion, it lived up to it's expectations.!!!!!! <br /> <br />Words can't describe how the good the movie was except it was excellent. I knew this movie was going to be good when I saw the cast list: Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, the question mark seemed to be Christian Bale could he pull of the biggest role of his career? The answer to that movie fans is yes!!! <br /> <br />Bale is somewhat underrated, he's appeared in some good movies and some stinkers but this movie interviews he did for \\"Batman Begins\\" on Access Hollywood, I knew he could do He was sincere and serious about making a good impression and he did on them some. He underwent some serious training to get into the role and it definitely shows on screen.Bale did an excellent job!!! <br /> <br />Liam Neeson who I praised on \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" likewise comes through with another memorable but short roles as Ducard, the man who takes Bruce Wayne under his wing and makes him a fighting machine. <br /> <br />With Ducard's help, Bruce Wayne (Bale) is able to come into grips about the murders of his parents, something that was eating away at him and destroying him.Through Ducard and Alfred's (Michael Caine) guidance, we see the origins of the Batman starting to come through until his Metamorphis in Gotham City is complete.  <br /> <br />Plotwise the movie title says it \\"Batman Begins\\" we see the origins of Batman/Bruce Wayne in detail from childhood to adult as he grows from a child coping with the death of his parents to a man possessed by his own destiny to rid the world evil and battle the demons inside him. <br /> <br />Then comes the real challenge for Wayne as he faces the corruption and violence that is overtaking the city. Sure we've seen this in the other Batman movies but what sets this one apart from the other ones, is the acting, the character development, in Bruce Wayne's growth as a man as he struggles within his demons, the psychological battles he plays with himself. <br /> <br />Enter Katie Holmes who plays Rachel Dawes , Waynes love interest and Batman's love interest, a good girl being caught in some bad company. You know Wayne loves her but he is still dealing with issues, becoming the Batman then provides an avenue for Bruce to get closer to Rachel while protecting her at the same time. <br /> <br />Cilliam Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane/The Scarecrow, is also excellent, he actually seems like an insignificant foe but once he's alter ego shows on the scree, it's a different story. Ken Watanabe as the other important figure Ra's Al Ghul who aids Wayne's training is good and last but not ;least Morgan Freeman as Luscious Fox who basically gives the first look at the creation that is the Batmobile is excellent. <br /> <br />Director Christopher Nolan not only deserves a pat on the back for his excellent adaptation of the comic book character but a hug from every comic book fan whose been wanting a respectable version of the \\"Dark Knight\\" for quite some time. <br /> <br />This movie had heart, it was gritty, it was dramatic, and Batman wasn't a stupid a cartoon cutout like George Clooney's stupid portrayal but he was a man, a real man with real problems and issues, and above you liked it, you really him We sympathized with Bale's portrayal as Wayne, and we cheer as he goes through his whole training until he becomes the Dark Knight and imprints his legacy as the defender of justice and truth. <br /> <br />I can't say anymore about this movie except it's perhaps the best if not the best Batman movie ever made, at the same level if not surpassing the original by Tim Burton. <br /> <br />Go see it now and enjoy!!!!
B00001ZWTT|4.0|I didn't go into this movie expecting much, and I was pleasantly surprised. Part western, part cop/buddy flick, part sci-fi, WWW  held its own. Smith and Kline did their standard great comedic jobs but Kenneth Branagh's over-the-top performance as an ultra-Confederate ultra-criminal was an unexpected treat.
B0006L16N8|5.0|While many bands grapple with the downfalls of fame and fortune, Coldplay has stayed surprising sober and grounded. In many ways, they are also your most unlikely superstars. With their third release, they once agin show the world why they are at the top of their game.<br /><br />X&Y improves on A Rush of Blood To The Head. The uplifting first single Speed Of Sound brings about a euphoric rush while it really talks dealing with being in the public eye. Elsewhere on the album, Coldplay does an excellent job merging Kraftwerk's seminal Computer Love into Talk, resulting in a little pleasant surprise. Other gems include Fix You, Low, The Hardest Part, Swallowed In The Sea and the bonus track tagged at the end.<br /><br />Frontman Chris Martin does an effortless job at expressing melancholy and joy as if they are his second natures.
B00005JNJT|3.0|This movie isn't as great as I'd heard it was, but it was pretty good. Bruce Wayne's backstory following his parents' murder is all more interesting and emotionally moving than what takes place after he actually becomes Batman. After that, it lapses into formulaic action movie chiches with yet another \\"big machine which must be stopped or we're all doomed\\".Bale spits and hisses his lines as Batman a bit too intensely, and his scowling lip contortions remind me of Sly in Judge Dredd. He's not that great a Batman, in my opinion. Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon, though, is picture perfect. Gordon has up till now pretty much been potrayed as a doofus on film, and Oldman looks and acts the way Gordon should. Michael Caine is perfect as Alfred, but that's no surprise. The villians were a tad weak, I thought. Not that I wanna see more of the over, over the top camp of the bad guys from the previous 4 movies, but Al Ghul and the Scarecrow aren't particularly interesting to me as potrayed here.Oh, well, I know alot of people aren't going to agree with this review, as this movie was being hailed as Batman's return to greatness long before it even came out. That's fine. It just didn't knock me on my can, and that's just how it is. Still, it's a marked improvement (to say the least) over the direction the Burton/Schumacher Bat-films eventually took, and I guess it will be forever revered for that reason alone.But to me, it's just another Batman movie, with nothing too stupid, and nothing particularly mind-blowing. With 7 big screen feature films under his utility belt (including Adam West, and Mask of the Phantasm), I feel the cinematic potential of Batman has yet to be fully exploited.Maybe next time.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|Like many others, I've seen the musical on Broadway.  But, unlike many, I actually preferred it with the cast performing now, NOT the original cast, the one that's singing on the soundtrack.  Especially Shoshona Bean's Elphaba.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I would have liked to hear just the singing without the spoken words of the play.  It gets in the way of the songs.  Favorites are the whimsical \\"Popular\\" and \\"What is this Feeling\\" and the very moving \\"Defining Gravity\\".  There is so much emotion in that song and I find myself thinking \\"Yay Elphaba!

B0002JJBZY|5.0|This series may seem dated to any person that wasn't born in the 1950s, but to anyone that watched it since the inception, they know it was ahead of its time. Gene Roddenberry's vision lives on today even though the most recent edition of the Star Trek series has been cancelled. Long before Star Wars this series caught the attention of SciFi fans that had only black & white Twilight Zone and Outer Limits before. This wonderfully colorful series did very well with the very limited budget they had. Look at all the things influenced by this series. There were no portable flip open phones, small data discs for computers, PDAs, or dozens of other items influenced by this series at the time it originally aired. Many first such as the interracial kiss were seen here. It truly asked questions that are still asked today. I have to tell you I liked the music more than in the last couple of Star Trek series.<br /><br />Only one thing puzzled me with this wonderful set. The order of the airings. If indeed these are in the order they were originally aired, then whoever decided to put them in that order should have been slapped up side the head. It has been to many years for me to recall what order I saw them in, but this does not seem correct. Anyone that followed the original series knows they all had tan uniforms in the beginning, then blue and other colors, etc. Doctor McCoy was the third doctor to appear in the series. Watching this set in the order they have them will make you think he was the first, then another doctor filled in, then another doctor did \\"The Cage\\" which is shown at the end of the series instead of at the beginning in this set. You will also note that when you do watch the two pilots, \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\" and \\"The Cage\\", they will seem out of place because as I mentioned all of a sudden the uniforms will look older and Spock will be shouting more.<br /><br />Call me persnickity, but I would like to have seen the two pilots shown first in the set and then the rest the series. At any rate I like the way they are boxed, the fact they are so compact, and they include the trailers. I actually had purchased all this set when they were two per disc, but after seeing all this set offered I donated the other set and bought this one. The other set took up two shelves of a bookcase compared to the less than a third of shelve for this entire set. They also did not include any commentaries or the previews. The quality is extremely sharp and clear. I recommend any fan of any Star Trek series or movies seriously consider getting the original series that started it all. My only real complaint is that Paramount is greedy. I wish people would boycott them. I love Scifi series and I buy the majority of them. Stargate SG-1 is another great series. MGM is not greedy like Paramount's Loaches. It will cost you about fifty bucks for one season of Stargate. You know how it cost over one hundred bucks to buy any one season of Star Trek. If anyone can afford to buy out Paramount and put prices right you will have the hearts of Star Trek fans forever. This set is at least in the ball park of reasonably priced, but it should be selling for about one hundred and sixty to be competitive with all the other great TV series on DVD.the series.

B0007P3582|1.0|This CD is by far the worst piece of s*** that I have ever had the misfortune to let grace my presence. This has to be the worst thing to happen to rap since Vanilla Ice. This guy has no \\"flow\\", no sense of rhyme or rhythm, and on top of it, I don't think he comprehends English very well. I truly believe that I could take a s***, record it and burn it to a CD, and have it mean than this load of garbage that he tries to pass of as an album.  It is quite obvious that he is only in the industry for the money, and when an artist is motivated by nothing more that greed and self satisfaction, then there is no good that can possibly be attributed to their work, if you can call it work.
B00005JNQ8|5.0|Who says this isn't a well-oiled thriller, its twists may come undone to some but they are far from witless. I saw the denouement three quarters of the way, but in all fairness the screenplay had me engrossed and thinking twice about every bathroom break I needed to take.<br /><br />The script is somewhat reminiscent of Hitchcock's North by Northwest -- United Nations, mistaken identities, intense chases and shadowings -- but Pollack's keen sense of narrative makes sure The Interpreter plays with a full deck.<br /><br />Most refreshing feature: it doesn't tiptoe around political messages despite its Hollywood roots. It audaciously sports a white African as the pivotal character. Anyone who's lived in modern day Africa knows that much of the continent's violence is now instigated by its own indigenous reprobates, not by Apartheid. The leader \\"Zuwanie\\" and the fictitious nation of \\"Matobo\\" may well be ill-concealed allusions to General Mugabe and Zimbabwe, so the theme should be doubly resonant to those with an eye for current affairs.<br /><br />The script couches several well-meaning lines about war and international politics, and of course, the raison d'etre of the United Nations. I found most of it credible, but caveat emptor to people who are disillusioned by the UN as it stands today: prepare to plug your nose in some scenes.<br /><br />Thankfully, there's a smattering of other reasons to watch this fine production. Aerial shots of NY's streets are slick. James Howard's music employs silence to great effect, building to sensational crescendos when a standoff could be so accentuated. I gather this is the first Hollywood crew to have been allowed access to actual U.N. premises, a privilege that Pollack takes full advantage of.<br /><br />While there is some merit to the gripe that it wallows in its characters' muddy pasts, it crackles in every attempt to unravel who is playing for whom, and more notably, why. Penn and Kidman's chemistry has attracted much commentary, though I was more taken by what keeps them apart than what brings them together.<br /><br />All in all, as balanced and wholesome a thriller as any in recent memory, recommended with unbridled enthusiasm.ry, though I was more taken by what keeps them apart than what brings them together.<br /><br />All in all, as balanced and wholesome a thriller as any in recent memory, recommended with unbridled enthusiasm.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|This is my first Foo Fighters album and I think it's great! For fans that like traditional Foo style, they've got plenty of songs on the first album. The second album showcases the band's versatility and I applaud them for venturing into new styles. I love both discs and they are definitely worth buying!! <br /> <br />People who are claiming that they cannot play the album on their computers: YOU MUST COPY IT FROM A PROGRAM YOU INSTALL FROM THE CD!!! You must click \\"agree\\" to terms on the pop-up window that shows up after inserting the disc in your computer, afterwards the another window will open where you can select \\"Copy music\\" that will be ripped to your \\"My Music\\" folder, playable on Windows Media Player (they are wma files). The album plays perfectly fine on my computer and my Rio portable player, so don't worry about compatibility issues!!! BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!
B0009HLDFU|5.0|One by One was an already tried and tested musical formula of full-tooth grins and possible exhaustion. Some may have enjoyed the guitar melodies of \\"Disenchanted Lullaby\\" and \\"Overdrive\\", but there was a fear that the Foo Fighters lost the sense of urgency that previously strengthened 1995's alterna-grunge selftitled debut and sophomore signature The Colour and the Shape, which united radio-friendly love rock with raging guitars and an evolving self-image and worth. 1999's There is Nothing Left to Lose was gentle to the point of euphoric rock ballet. This brings us full circle to One by One, an album lead vocalist and guitarist Dave Grohl admittedly forced himself to finish and ready for releasing.    In Your Honor's first single, \\"Best Of You\\", would have fit perfectly on One by One. Despite Grohl's howling and heavier-than-expected guitars, it does not stray from the Foos' recent \\"perfect pop tune\\" strategy. It may not represent the character and diversity of In Your Honor, but it certainly won't make traditional fans turn their heads.    The album's first disc is \\"rock\\" oriented and struts the band's heaviest stuff to date, including probable single \\"DOA\\" and the opening title track, which features a midway scream that could break a mirror and frustrated lyrics that are a bit too open and direct to be from Grohl's previous band. What does have his previous band written all over it is \\"Friend Of A Friend\\", off of the album's acoustic-based second disc. Slow and narrative, lyrics like \\"He's never been in love/But he knows just what love is/He says nevermind\\" just might remind listeners of a certain former bandmate. Other highlights include \\"Still\\", which is like an expanded version of Pearl Jam's No Code opener \\"Sometimes\\", \\"What If I Do?\\"'s haunting chorus, the Norah Jones duet \\"Virginia Moon\\" (improbable but beautiful, in a sleepy and dreamy way), and drummer Taylor Hawkins' first appearance as a lead vocalist on \\"Cold Day in the Sun\\" (a track perfect for summerand genuine happy and lazy feelings).    Former band references? Check. Edgy songs that rekindle the band's trademark fire? Check. Beautiful tunes, both rocking and acoustic, that cover ground from all four previous LPs while still letting loose new chords and lyrical lightning (or \\"thunder\\", as Dave screams)? Check. In Your Honor is 20 slices of the pure musicianship, pop, and sincerity that rock n' roll dreams are made of.
0671027387|4.0|For my first online review Deception Points lends itself beautifully. It has political double-crossing, space and oceanic exploration, love, sex and the high expectation of turning the page quickly to find out what else could possibly happen in this jam-packed thriller.<br /><br />President Zackery Herney is approaching running for reelection with a strong new opposition in Senator Sexton.  Both are divided on the issue of  huge spending for NASA to continue with government involvement and control or to be left to the private sector to finance.  Someone is feeding information to Senator Sextons assistant that NASA is failing when the President announces that NASA has made a huge discovery.  The story line keeps your adrenaline pumping and the pages turning whether you believe the findings or not!  Dan Brown adds in well researched data and tosses in a bit of love and sex and you find yourself sad when the book comes to a close so quickly.  A great thrill ride and worth your time.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I sort of liked what the other guys said. But I don't think this album took time for me to get into. I absolutely love Coldplay, ever since I started to buy their album in A Rush of Blood To The Head. Once I read the Entertainment Weekly review on summer cd's and conerts, I knew I had to get the new X&Y cd. About a week before the acutal release in the United States, MTV.com released it on their \\"The Leak.\\" I must have listened to that whole album at least 10 times before I actually bought the album. I love their smooth British pop sound and.... I just love it all. How can you not like Coldplay? I think that this album will outdo A Rush of Blood To The Head. I think that they did a wonderful job of putting together the cd. It has a great beat throughout the whole cd. From mid-tempo, to slow songs, this cd has it all. Their debut song, \\"Speed of Sound\\" really nailed the board with their upbeat fast paced song about finding yourself. I will also use a quote from Chris Martin as used in Entertainment Weekly, \\"There are some great break up songs to break up with your girlfriend.\\" This cd is just the tip of the iceberg as they might have 1 more cd up their sleeve.
B0009IW88A|4.0|Like so many Batman fans, the music of Danny Elfman cast a long shadow over all things Gotham. Even during the various incarnations of Batman in animated format you could hear inspiration from Elfman. This was not necessarily a bad thing. The score that Elfman created was epic and iconic. Much like Alexander Courage's work with Star Trek, Elfman's Batman score created the bar with which all other Batman (and possibly comic book film) composer had to rise to.  <br /> <br />Thankfully, Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard are more then up to the task. Like the film franchise itself, Zimmer and Howard decided to take Batman in a completely different direction, musically. Gone are the over the top brass declaring the arrival of the Caped Crusader. Where Elfman musically embraced Batman's comic book roots, Zimmer and Howard firmly ground Bruce Wayne in real world tones. That is not to say that Zimmer and Howard do not go epic with their scoring. Far from it. The score to Batman Begins is almost Wagnerian in its attempt to musically tell a tale of tragedy, anger, and finally redemption. Like the film, the score to Batman Begins is simply the beginning of Bruce Wayne's and Gotham's rise from the abyss of despair. <br /> <br />Like all good scores, Batman Begins is very much a companion piece to the film and is far more enjoyable once the movie has been seen. With each track I am able to visualize moments from the film and again enjoy the various arcs that Nolan and Goyer created. Where Elfman created the iconic sound of Batman, Zimmer and Howard composed the music for an entire world. A world of darkness and hope.
B000001F3C|5.0|I know most people prefer \\"The Joshua Tree\\" above all other u2 albums but for me, 'War\\" is U2's shining moment. This album was produced BEFORE they became mega-stars (which I believe eventually ruined the band). This is the last album BEFORE their status reached new heights of popularity. They got real big, real quick. I remember when this album first came out, and not too many people had heard of them yet. \\"War\\" focuses on, what else, WAR and strife both throughout the world and in Ireland. I love every song on here. It's played and sung with emotion. The production is raw, not crisp and clear like on \\"Unforgettable Fire\\" and \\"Joshua Tree.\\"  These guys were still trying to get their name heard in The United States. And heard we did. With \\"Unforgettabe Fire\\" U2 were mega stars. Then came \\"Joshua Tree\\" and every 12 year old in the country was singing \\"but I still havent found what I'm looking for.\\" UUUUGGGHH.  That was the last album I ever purchased by U2. This album still remains on my \\"play list\\" with timeless classics such as \\"New Years Day\\" \\"Seconds\\" 'Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" \\"40\\" and \\"Like A Song.\\" I would highly recommend adding this album to your music collection. It's a wonderful piece of work.
B00067BBQE|5.0|I have heard many complaints that this DVD concert was ruined because of its video editing, but that didn't stop me from buying this title anyway.  And as it turns out, the only thing that disappoints me is that this product has received so poor reviews.  I thought the editing was done very well.  Though the camera may cut away quickly at times, it is done in a way that translates the high energy of the concert for home viewing.  Something that I have noticed that is used in this DVD unlike other live music DVDs of mine is its often use of special effects.  While some enhance the moment and make things a bit more interesting, to be honest, some of them seem to be a bit overdone.  Luckily, these effects do not last too long and they don't appear that often, and they can very easily be tolerated and ignored.  I can see how someone would disagree with me if they think that ANY kind of effect to video looks bad, and I'll admit, I was hesitant at first, but once I got into it, I loved every second of it.  This is the best music DVD I have purchased in a very long time.  I am shocked, just shocked, that this DVD has received such bad reviews. <br /> <br />The quality of the video and the audio of the live performance were excellent.  The same great audio quality can be heard in the audio CD it comes with, which also includes a studio recording of a previously unreleased song.  Also worth mentioning are the wonderful DVD extras including all four music videos from Evanescence's Fallen album and an hour long \\"behind the scenes\\" feature.  For everything you get with this CD/DVD package, it is a great buy, and even better than I had originally expected.
B000002JOH|5.0|Idiot...... Pantera's not for pu****s anyways <br /> <br />Vulgar display of too much power!, May 31, 2005  <br /> Reviewer:    A music fan   <br />  <br />Pantera is one of the many bands that ruined heavy metal. Everything sucks!. I hate the sound of the bass drums, volcals and everything. I can't believe this album went platinum with suck crappy sound. It's too intense for me. The only good metal bands out there are Black sabbath, Metallica, Iron maiden, And Alice in chains.( Alice in chains is really grunge but what the hay, they are awsome.)I dont't reccomend this DEATH METAL album to any true metal fan. This album is a vulgar display of power. Too much power! Do not waste your money on this f****d up album. You'll cry!
B00005JNJT|3.0|This wasn't the Batman movie i have been waiting for.......although it does return to its darker roots such as in previous (Burton) films but when you acutally see Batman in this movie it really just isn't exciting.....the action is average nothing too amazing...this movie is very long 2 hours and 30 minutes and i really have to say batman is in the movie for roughly 30 minutes if even that............most of the movie consists of dialouge and plot build up which really isn't even that interesting...........The scarecrow was a lame excuse for a villian although Cillian Murphy played his role pretty decent it still fell flat.........If you are expecting to see an all out thrill seeking action Batman movie avoid this because this is complete opposite.......this is a drama with Batman in it for 30 minutes......its pretty boring.........iono though amazon.com is giving it 4 1/2 stars...........hmmmmmm anyways i guess i'll just have to wait for the sequel to really get the whole vibe of the new Batman series
B00005JNJV|5.0|This is by far the best Batman movie ever.  And for all those people that write reviews without seeing the movie and saying that they should have let it go.  You need to see the movie.  And the horses breathing fire thing you will understand when you see the movie.  I think that this movie answered ever question I had, and I have been watching baman since I was a kid.  I have seen all the movies.  I will admit at first I didnt want to see it but I went and loved it.  Its the best.  I give this movie 10 stars.  One of th best movies of the summer.
1878424319|5.0|The messages in this book are much needed among humanity. Out of curiosity, I had to see a bit about the reviewer below that calls this book \\"nonsense\\". The man is 53 years old, so please bear in mind that while some people may have a half century of wisdom, there are millions of young adults that could really use the inight this book provides.   It helped me a lot, especially about not taking things personally and making assumptions. This is a really great book, you will be glad you read it!
B0002UXBD6|5.0|I was glad to finally hear that Green Day has returned, and they have an amazing mature sound. The CD is 13 tracks (plus 4 non-album b-sides: Favorite, Son, Governator, Shoplifter and Too Much Too Soon). Every track is good in its own right, however not everything will please everybody. From fast songs to slower dramatic ones, the album delivers. A little on the Special Edition. It's a book w/ the CD in the back. The CD itself is the exact same as the jewel case one (however, for the Special Edition, I wish they would have included the b-sides)but in better packaging.A true turning point in their career.
B0007P3582|1.0|Boy, oh boy did he just misunderstood Pete \\"Snake's\\" view on Rap music, thinking that he hates ALL Rap in general. Did you not interpret what Pete said that he likes Old School Rap like Public Enemy and KRS-One? Please, if you are going to mistake him as a complete Rap hater, go wallow yourself in shame for being an ignorant moron. Also, Death Metal is NOT garbage, so shut up and let us listen to what we like.    Now, back to this CD. I agree with the majority of those who hate 50's CDs. He is the most overrated and untalented rapper ever and his Garbage-Unit is the most untalented rap group in the Rap world as well. All he does is diss other artists, though he disses most of the other untalented rappers as well (e.g. Jay-Z). This CD exemplifies the fact that this is not a true Rap record, it is all wack (had to say that). 50 has been shot nine times and yet he still lives?! How can anyone sustain nine such gunshots and still make it out alive is clearly beyond me. 50 is not hardcore nor is he a \\"gangsta.\\" He is more of a \\"wanksta\\" if you ask me and other smart Rap listeners. I hope that if 50 gets shot for the tenth time, he better die along with his music because that pathetic excuse for a rapper can't even flow.    In fact, 98% of today's Rap is clearly garbage. The only reason why 2% of today's Rap is good is that there are very few of these artists that truly go with the flow. These artists are Jurassic 5, Deltron 3030, Aesop Rock, and Atmosphere to name a few. But the REAL good Rap/Hip-Hop is Old School stuff. Public Enemy, KRS-One, Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five, and De La Soul are examples. I recommend getting these CDs from these kind of rappers.    P.S. I listen to more of the Metal stuff but, like I said, if I want to hear AUTHENTIC Rap, it has got to be Old School stuff. And here is a song line from Public Enemy:    \\"Some say I never heard of 'ya. A rap burglar, false media. We don't need it, do we? It's fake that's what it be to 'ya, dig me? Don'tbelieve the hype...\\"    Public Enemy - Don't Believe The Hype
B0007GAERG|1.0|After having rediscovered Mariah's earlier CDs and enjoying them, I decided to give the new one a go.  I couldn't make it through the first time I tried, but forced myself to listen all the way through tonight.  Tuneless, hip-hop, subwoofer (today's greatest noise pollution curse) thumping, urban, boring, (did I say tuneless?)chord (if there truly are chords) repetitive crap.  I don't think Mimi was emancipated, but sucked into what's currently popular and trapped there.   I think all of you who sang the praises of this album owe me my money back.
B0006L16N8|4.0|Coldplay aims for the upper stratosphere with their third studio album, X&Y.  The album has the dense, ethereal sound that has become the band's signature.  There is a sense of space on the album, with many of the lyrics dealing with planetary and celestial issues.  The first three tracks are all outstanding.  \\"Square One\\" starts off with orchestral florish and ends with a acoustic guitar.  \\"What If\\" has pensive lyrics that opens up with just a piano and then builds to a string-laden crescendo.  \\"White Shadows\\" may be the best track on the album.  It has all of the band's best elements, soaring vocals and big, over-the-top sound.  Built around an organ that has a church pipe organ sound, the song starts off with the organ and then a U2esque guitar falls in.  The drums and bass provide a pulsating foundation around the vocals.  \\"Speed Of Sound\\" is a rival for the best song on the album with a jangling guitar and falsetto vocal.  The album's last two tracks are a bit of a disappointment.  \\"Swallowed In The Sea\\" is a bit too ambitious for its own good and \\"Twisted Logic\\" never really clicks.  The bonus track \\"Til Kingdom Come\\" was supposedly written for the late Johnny Cash.  It is basically just an acoutic guitar with some keyboards and although you wouldn't mistake the band for a country group, it is an earnest effort.  X&Y solidifies Coldplay as one of the biggest bands in rock today.
B000683VI4|5.0|I recomend this movie to anyone who is tired of the normal high school drama love story between the nerdy girl and the hot high school jock. Every one knows there are always at least 2 of these movies released a year. The Notebook takes you on a different journey as well as another time. It was taken during the 1940's. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The relationship between Noah and Allie is something to be admired...its not always perfect but you can feel the love between the two of them. Even with her parents disapproval, she still loves him. When she is prematurely rushed away, she cries herself to sleep for monthes. Noah writes her everyday, hoping that they could continue this great love. While her mother takes all the letters and hides them. Years later when she goes to see him..she gets that same feeling as she did at 17. She falls in love with him all over again. Needless to say..this movie makes any girl want a Notebook romance. Enjoy!
B0007OCG56|2.0|I can't say that this movie was a disapointment, because I didn't expect much from it anyway.  Director/screenwriter James L. Brooks dishes up a lump of all too common Hollywood schlock that seldom ventures far from cliche and total predictability.  First the good news--the movie gets two stars because the screenplay does have its moments.  In rare moments Brooks' dialogue forces us to open an eye with his satire of the modern \\"how do we feign concern for eachother's feelings when we are prepared to wage any manner of psychological warfare to get what we want\\" nuclear family meltdown.  Also, Tea Leoni delivered a flawed yet memorable rendition of the neurotic underachieving, over competitive housewife, Debra, showing us a character that more complex than the critics gave her credit for.  Also impressive was Shelbie Bruce as Christina, Flor's daughter, delivering her lines in English as well as Spanish, she was always interesting to see on the screen.  Otherwise the movie, like Adam Sandler, is listliss and unimaginative. <br /> <br />I came to the movie as a Paz Vega fan.  After her stunning performance in \\"Sex and Lucia\\" it was hard to see her reduced to nods of incomprehension, mouth-open eye-darting incomprehension, and inexpressed frustration.  For approximately two thirds of the movie, her \\"espagnol sola\\" character is not allowed to say anything in English and the schtick wears thin.  And what a waste, to have a talent like Vega reduced to various renditions of speechless embarrassment.  But we can hardly blame Ms. Vega considering the material she had to work with.  It's a sad commentary on what an accomplished European actor will put up with in order to break into Hollywood.   <br /> <br />In other aspects, the screenplay drags the movie down.  It's treatment of the responsibilities of parenting verges on preachy, and the pivotal moment of sexual temptation between the husband and Flor is unconvincing.  Also, the editing reduced the movie to a formless lump as important subplot naratives are left without conclusion (i.e. the scene in which neurotic mother Debra sees her pudgy dauthter in the clothes that housekeeper Fluor altered to fit the daughter). <br /> <br />After seeing what Spanish director/screenwriter Julio Medem did with Paz Vega, James L.Brooks handily demonstrates what Hollywood is all about--rank mediocity.  Rent it, and then forget it. <br /> <br />
B0006L16N8|5.0|Finally, good music. That's what I can firmly say about X&Y. Coldplay is one of the greatest bands right now. This is a stunningly epic CD. Each song is a true joy and pleasure to hear. Coldplay has impressed me. While I enjoyed AROBTTH, X&Y has made me a fan for life. The music on the album continues to stay in my head day after day. These guys have really improved and deserve all of their wonderful success and praise.  They are setting the standard this year. From the first song SQUARE ONE to the final song TIL KINGDOM COME, you will be hooked. The first great album of 2005.
B00080ZG10|5.0|I couldn't call myself a DeCaprio fan because I barely watched all of the movie Titanic, but after watching The Aviator I have a newfound respect for DeCaprio's acting ability, he was absolutely marvelous in this movie and it appeared to me that this was not an easy man to portray. I will watch it again simply because I was in awe of a man that I knew very little about, just that he was a rich man. DeCaprio was very very good and I would recommend that everyone see this movie. It was a classic.
1932907009|5.0|OK, maybe not the last book you'll ever need, but if you are a screenwriter or play one on TV, this just may be the BEST book you'll ever need, or read, on the subject of how to break into the big screen big time as a writer of tall tales. <br /> <br />Blake Snyder is a working, selling writer himself, so that gives the reader a true inside glimpse into what it's like, what it takes, and what to expect on the long road to screenwriting stardom. Many screenwriting how-to tomes are written by guys and gals who have few or no real studio credits, so with this book you can be sure you are getting the info direct from the source of a successful member of the Hollywood elite. <br /> <br />Snyder starts out with a bang, describing how important a good title, pitch and concept are, and giving tons of useful advise for whipping those log lines into shape, the best shape ever in fact, for as the author points out, many industry powerbrokers won't even look beyond a log line...so it better be good. Damned good. He then discusses how to make your story like everything else out there, only different, and if you can come to understand that paradox, you will be a success indeed. <br /> <br />We also learn about the importance of creating characters that fit certain archetypes, like the hero and the villain, and how the use of Jungian archetypes can help you shape and mold real people that resonate with the audience. Also covered is the importance of knowing your genre and how to best amplify the style of that genre.  <br /> <br />Another chapter deals with the author's own system of breaking a script down to 15 beats, and how every successful movie fits this same beat system. We also learn the art of building scenes and the use of those wonderful index cards for moving and changing scene progression, as well as following the basic rules of a great story, rewriting and reshaping the script, and of course, what the heck to do with the darned thing once you've finished. I really appreciated the glossary of screenwriting and industry terminology, something every writer should know (or at least pretend to know in meetings). <br /> <br />Although this book does follow the mold of many other screenwriting books before it, focusing both on writing and marketing the script and including summaries and exercises for the reader to expand their understanding, the difference that makes this book stand out is the honesty and directness of the author in giving the reader every best chance to comprehend and conquer the inner and outer workings of screenwriting. \\"Save the Cat\\" (I'll let you find out what the title means on your own!) doesn't hold back on doling out the solid advise, and presents it in a way that will not only inspire screenwriters, but also make them more aware of just how hard it really is to succeed. No sugar-coating here, but plenty of motivation and great info packed into one book. <br /> <br />So, \\"Save the Cat\\" may not be the final screenwriting book you will ever need, should for some reason the entire industry change and adopt some bizarro new standard of screenwriting that will require you to learn the metric system and Pig-Latin. But barring a drastic reshaping of the industry standard (I think most execs are too lazy to change much of anything), this is no doubt the one book that will do more to help you achieve success and get your two-brad-bound puppy through the door than any other I've read so far. And believe me, folks, I've read them all.  <br /> <br />FADE OUT.
B0006L16N8|4.0|of the last album, and that is exactly what Coldplay has done.  If you like Coldplay's first two releases, you are undoubtedly going to like this one.  In some ways, that familiarity of sound is this album's greatest strength.  And you could also argue that the familiarity of sound is this album's greatest weakness.  A perfect example is Fix You.  I know I've heard it before and I think it was a song called The Scientist, but I love it still.  It's hard for me to say what is wrong with this album because I think that would come across as some sort of self-righteous self-promotion; as in, look at how insightful I am - I'm ripping Coldplay for being Coldplay!!!  This album is, plainly and simply, Coldplay doing what Coldplay does as well as any band currently playing music:  great piano based ballads; a few rockers here and there; Chris Martin's vocals; well-produced pop/rock (undoubtedly more produced and more sonically dense and a bit warmer than their first two albums); and just enough new stuff that's really just old stuff thrown in so it's not a reprise of their last two. <br /> <br />New Stuff that really isn't new but it is the tweak in this album: <br /> <br />Square One - I love how it starts with layered, ambient synths.  Great Brian Enoish touch. <br /> <br />Talk - Ever heard Kraftwerk's \\"Computer Love\\" - what a great integration of an old-synth hook into a new guitar hook. <br /> <br />Low - Does anyone hear some David Bowie in this one?  Great track. <br /> <br />I'm sure there's more, but I'm just a boring white attorney with limited time, so I haven't figured out what else to write, except to say . . .  <br /> <br />Go buy the album. <br /> <br />P.S.  Ok.  I like the album.  But I am going to make one criticism, which is my look-at-me-I'm-so-smart-for-ripping-Coldplay.  Chris Martin's lyrics are treachly, syrupy, mushy.  He asks obvious questions and writes love songs like a 13 year old.  Buy the album anyways because as I've said, if you like Coldplay, you'll like it.  Just don't expect the lyrics to make you think.  A strong lyricist Chris Martin is not, but he sells his product with conviction and that's apparently good enough to sell millions of records to millions of fans - me included.
0345472640|5.0|WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE...AND YOUNG, Lieutenant General (Ret.) Harold (Hal) G. Moore's and Joe Calloway's painstakingly detailed history of 1965's Battle of the Ia Drang Valley, should be required reading for anyone interested in war, particularly those who still believe that there is something noble or glorious about men engaging in politically sanctioned slaughter.<br /><br />This prior comment is no indictment of anyone in particular, especially not the soldiers who fought in the Ia Drang, whether Americans or Vietnamese. Both sides demonstrated uncommon bravery and fortitude under fire. The comment stands however, as an indictment of the waste and horror of battle, the brutishness of men killing each other, and the cost of war in young human lives.<br /><br />The Battle of the Ia Drang was the first major engagement of United States forces against the People's Army of North Vietnam. It took place over the course of a week at two clearings in the jungle called Landing Zone X-Ray and Landing Zone Albany, and was the first battle deployment of airmobile troops in history.<br /><br />Incomplete intelligence and ill-advised orders (to find and kill the enemy, rather than to hold enemy territory) resulted in the 1st Battalion of the 7th Infantry, numbering less than 500 men, being airdropped into the red-hot center of NVA-controlled South Vietnam. The Americans were met by more than 2000 North Vietnamese regulars who were defending their major southern command post. Even before the GIs were off their helicopters they came under withering enemy fire. Moore and Calloway are terrifyingly graphic in their descriptions of the ordered chaos which ensued. Although the Americans won the day at X-Ray, they did so at an unconscionable human price. Their stand at LZ Albany, two days later, was little short of disastrous.<br /><br />Moore cuts the army brass no ice in criticizing the overall strategy behind the Battle of the Ia Drang. It should have been abundantly clear to anyone with eyes to see that the Vietnamese Communists were a superbly trained ground force utterly committed to their cause, willing to fight to the last drop of blood. The human cost of the battle and the nature of the enemy should have forced a massive reconsideration of U.S. means and goals right at the beginning of the greater U.S. committment in Vietnam. That it didn't is a tragedy.<br /><br />Although I have given WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE...AND YOUNG five well-deserved stars for its story, the book (at least the mass market paperback edition) suffers from very poor formatting. I have read voraciously for the last 40 years and this is one of the few books I have experienced that is measurably devalued by its atrocious editing.<br /><br />WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE...AND YOUNG is not Hal Moore's book, but a history of the 7th Division at Ia Drang. General Moore not only includes his own reminiscences, but those of other survivors, most often directly transcribed from interviews.<br /><br />The various participants' accounts are not clearly set off from each other by conventions such as indents or font changes. As a result, they often impinge on each other confusingly, and it becomes difficult to determine whose voice is speaking at a given moment.<br /><br />Since many men are recounting their personal experiences, a single incident (or person) may be introduced and discussed several times. This undifferentiated style gives the reader an impression of weak writing, which it is not. Still, it becomes too easy to lose one's place in what at times appears to be the world's most incredibly convoluted run-on sentence.<br /><br />But for this editor's flaw, which has nothing to do with the authors or their subject, reading WE WERE SOLDIERS ONCE...AND YOUNG is a shattering experience everyone should share.tnamese Communists were a superbly trained ground force utterly committed to their cause, willing to fight to the last drop of blood.

B000001FTD|5.0|I remember when I first heard about Antrax. 1/4 of the big four thrash bands. When I first heard the term \\"rap metal\\" reffering to them, I immeadiatly hated them. I was wrong. I was in Bull Moose when I was browsing through music. I saw the name Antrax and remember how everyone was wetting their pants over this album. So I asked the guy their to show me were to find it. He took me to the used music area and I thought \\"oh sh** I'm making a mistake.\\" it was only six bucks. a good price for something a didn't expect to be good. so when i took it home along with dio's sacred heart cd (awsome cd) i listened to this first. then immeadlitly after the beggining of among i thought \\"hey i got paid lots of money less then i should of\\" i was instanly hooked. so buy this album.  1.Among 5/5 title tracks are usually always one of the best on cd and i agree. eerie beginging  2.Caught in a Most 8/5 so f'in awsome this is my 2nd favorite song on this cd  3.I am the Law 5.5/5 4rd favorite so awsome as well  4.N.F.L 5/5 not the best but still really good  5.Skeleton 4/5 don't really listen to that much but i like it when i do  6.Indians 10/5 just to damn awsome, one of my favorite songs of all time, i can play it on my guitar, solos easy but kick ass  7.One World 5/5 nice leave from indians because sometimes good songs are followed by crap  8.A.D.I. 4/5 worst song but still good  9.Imitation of Life 7/5 like Dio's ending for Last in Line Cd with the song Egypt, this is definatly the way to end a Cd my 3rd favorite song  Oh yeah, there's a review under mine somewhere that says this is rap/rock and not thrash. Don't listen to them. This is thrash. Antrax wasn't rap/rock until \\"Sound of White Noise\\" I believe. OUT. \m/
B000957O7S|2.0|Will Smith always pretty much does the same role so not alot changes with Him on the Screen.Kevin James is kinda like the White Cedric The Entertainer in this film with His dancing&Antics. He is pretty much the bright spot of the film&that ain't saying much.the story line was cool.Eva Mendes is One Hot Mamma.but not much in terms of Acting.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Just to make it clear some other reviews are saying that they dislike this movie and it alters things in the Batman universe and that it all feels a little strange changing or challenging what we already know. <br /> <br />The only problem with this is that the reviews making this kind of idiotic statement are taking the original batman movies (by Tim Burton) as gospel and saying that changes to there earlier series of movies is of putting is simply ridiculous. For example in Batman Begins it is Joe Chill, as in the comics, who killed Bruce Wayne's parents not the Joker. The fact that this movie stays true to the source material should be applauded not question by no nothings who give it 3star reviews for challenging their myopic view of the caped crusader. <br /> <br />I was a huge fan of the first two Tim Burton movies but the time as finally come to relegate them to the third and forth spot as greatest batman movies with Batman Begins edging out the superb Mask Of the Phantasm in to second place. <br /> <br />As a fan of Batman and movies in general if another comic adaptation reaches these heights again I will be very impressed.
B0000057C5|5.0|Okay before I get started I just wanted to say this...what really ticks me off is the fact that Till Linderman (The singer of the band) is probably one of the best singers out there today, but yet he is really unheard of, while stupid wimpy pop artists like Hilary Duff and Jesse McCarntey are the only singers today that get any kind of recognition. Till can freakin kill those wimpy pop stars and send them crying home to their mommies with a powerfull voice like his. Till can be able to sing opera...his voice comes out loud, clear, but still in pitch with the key signature of each song.<br /><br />Okay, now I'm going to actually review this item. Simply amazing is all I have to say. Great guitar chords and riffs with really nice clear, but crisp sounding distortion on it, nice keybaord player with atmospheric/techno sounds and tone effects and modules on the keyboards, good bass, good drums, and Till is an excellent singer. What annoys me though is how people are so quick to judge without actually hearing the stuff. This is a German band. So of course, there are going to be alot of people who are going to be suspicious of that, and try to pretend it's not good and not listen to it at all. Come on people. Music comes in lots of diffent languges. So what it's in German and you can't understnad what they're saying. That stuff doesn't really matter. What matters is that acutall music and the talnet behind it. Infact, the German lyrics blend and mix in really well with there music. Here's how I rate each song:<br /><br />Senshuct: 5/5 Guitar chords sounded really weird and kinda random at first, but I got used to it and I like this song, nice way to start off the albume<br /><br />Engel: 2/5 I don't really like this song so much but all other Rammstein fans do. I don't know why I don't like it I just don't. The Bass player sounds fake in this song.<br /><br />Teir: 2/5 Again, I don't really like this song much, but it has an American feeling to it.<br /><br />Bestrafer Mich: 5/5 Beatuiful, beatuiful song....this is simply amazing. Attractive guitar chords, and a great bass line to match it, and nice atmospheric sounds by the keyboard. I listen to this song everytime I listen to this album.<br /><br />Du Hast: 5/5 Great song, my favorite one on here. Has a very nice groove and rhythem to it, and great techno keyboards in here. This is where Till really sings his best, and wow, can he sing. Must listen to this song.<br /><br />Buck Dich: 5/5 This song makes me want to jump around and have a mosh pit. Great heavy metal song.<br /><br />Split Mit Meir: 5/5 I used to not like this song because it sounded to weird for me and I didn't like it, or really be able to have a feel for it. But after a few more listens, now I do. Some nice stuff here. This is the deepest, creepest, darkest song on this album. Very nice. The keybaord player adds awhole lot of sounds and textures to this song that just really make it sound good.<br /><br />Klavier: 5/5 Just like Bestrafer Mich, this is a beuatiful song. Starts out with some accoustic guitars. Then it gets heavy, then it just repeats taht pattern through out the whole song. Till does his good singing in here, also.<br /><br />Alter Mann: 4/5 Great song, makes me feel sad though sometimes, for some reason<br /><br />Eifershult: 5/5 Some nice heavy guitar riffs here<br /><br />Kuss Mich: 2/5 Don't really like this song too much, i'm not sure why, I'm just not attracted to it much.<br /><br />(and the optional) Stripped: 5/5 I love the keyboards in this song. I also like how they sing in english so that you know what they're saying. Music in here is very nice.<br /><br />Overall this is a great album, and I highly reccomend it to you if you like heavy/industrial metal. This stuff rules.strafer Mich: 5/5 Beatuiful, beatuiful song....this is simply amazing. Attractive guitar chords, and a great bass line to match it, and nice atmospheric sounds by the keyboard.

B000005DSN|4.0|I'll keep this review short and to the point, seeing as how I don't listen to this record all too often.  Stratovarius, hailing from Finland, are one of the most well-known acts in the power metal scene.  Forming in the mid-80s, they released a long string of albums beginning with Fright Night (1989).  Visions is their sixth (if I am correct) album, released in 1997 under Modern Music.  Highlights include opener \\"The Kiss of Judas\\", anthemic single \\"Black Diamond\\", the vocal-driven \\"Forever Free\\", chilling ballad \\"Before the Winter\\" and the fast headbanger \\"Legions\\".  The album features energetic riffs and killer solos from Timo Tolkki, some insane drumming from Jorg Michael, complemented by Timo Kotipelto's soaring voice. Although I think Kotipelto's vocals could have been a little better, and some songs too, Visions is a great metal album reinventing the classic style of Iron Maiden and Judas Priest.  Check it out if you're into this genre, especially for fans of Hammerfall and Sonata Arctica.     <br /> <br />9/10
6304474652|5.0|While there doesn't appear to be a formal soundtrack produced for the movie, check out iTunes.  You can buy a number of songs singly, and if you search under iMixes and look for the one called \\"Fools Rush in Soundtrack\\" with 21 songs (not 19) you'll find the most complete list. You can buy it all at once using the iTunes shopping cart.
630512762X|4.0|Wow, it's been a long time when an all out action movie impressed me but this movie is awesome. Action doesn't get any bigger than this. <br /> <br />The movie starts with a flashback, we see Castor Troy in sniper mode trying to take down FBI big man, Sean Archer who apparently is always on his case. Sean is with his small kid and when Castor takes the shot, it goes through Sean's back and hits his kid in the head. Six years later, Sean is a real hard-a$$ who devotes so much time trying to track and kill Castor that he neglects his wife and teenage daughter. Castor is looking cool as ever and he plants a bomb in the L.A. convention center to take out 3 judges. He succeeds in planting the bomb, but is caught when he tries to escape in one of the best action sequences I've ever seen. In his attempt, he is left in a coma. To find out the whereabouts of the bomb, Sean takes on Castor's face, literally to uncover the situation of the bomb from Castor's brother, Pollux. Castor awakes from his come, takes on Sean's face and the story ensues... <br /> <br />When it comes to stylized action sequences, no one but John Woo is the master. Note that I said \\"stylized\\", not \\"gory\\" or \\"realistic\\". In fact, to thoroughly enjoy this movie, you have to pay no attention to logic. The plot has many shortcomings, but the action more than makes up for it. The story is captured in awe-inspiring action sequences that involves planes, boats and every other thing that explodes with style. The two leads also make the movie that much more than what it is. They are given unique roles because they get to play the bad guy and good guy, and they nail it. Nic Cage has always been one of my favourite actors, he can always play diverse roles with ease. As Castor Troy, he plays him as an extremely cool albeit slightly demented guy. A scene when he steps out of his car with his coat flapping ever so cool, is classic. And when he plays Sean Archer, he turns into someone suffering and in pain. John Travolta meanwhile is a much better Sean Archer than Castor Troy, but that's not to say his performance was bad. He really did a good job as well. <br /> <br />In short, this is superb movie to just sit back and enjoy. The action is implemented very nicely and it just seems that the actors are having a hell of a time. I always loved action movies and this is easily ranked one of the best. High octane, and what an adrenaline rush.
B000957O82|5.0|Both [[ASIN:B000T8XYOW Maxim [2-year]]] and [[ASIN:B000LXHJDM Cosmopolitan [1-year subscription]]] magazines have the same basic message, but where Cosmo will title it \\"Change Him For The Better,\\" Maxim will rework it into a more easily digested format that men won't automatically reject...and that's what this film does with the romantic comedy subgenre.  Will Smith's wisecracking attitude and the slapstick comedy of him helping men win over the women of their dreams (serious relationships only, no one-night stands) while he can't make it work for himself is outright hilarious, such as when he shows Eva Mendes where her great-great-grandfather signed into Ellis Island only to have her run out the room screaming because he didn't know that the guy was called \\"The Butcher of Cadiz\\" for a completely different reason.  It even comes with tricks for picking up women that I never would have thought of before, such as pretending to mistake her for a waitress in order to get her away from the crowd she's in, or making it look like you dove into oncoming traffic to rescue her dog by lying on the pavement in front an idling taxi you'd just staged a minute earlier.  It's on a par with pretty much anything that John Cusack's put out on the same subject.
B0000DZ3HM|5.0|One of the best jazz compilation on DVD I ever bought. <br />If you are found of real, main stream jazz, a lot of music to make your dreams coming true. <br />Special mention for Fredie Hubbard and Herbie Hancock on the first and second take. <br />For me, the most musical and impressive song is \\"appointment in Ghana\\" played by Jackie Mc Lean and Woody Shaw. Since this listenning, Mr McLean is one of my favorite alto saxophone player and is definitely another white brother. Woody Shaw is absolutly phenomenal in the way he reflects the deepest emotion. <br />A DVD to be collected for true jazz lovers.
0141301155|5.0|As Roald Dahl's masterpiece \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" opens the first chapter is totally devoted to its protagonist Charlie and his poor family. \\"Here Comes Charlie\\", the first chapter, is supposed to be sad -- but it isn't. Actually it is quite funny, mostly due to Dahl's touch and enchanting Quentin Blake's illustrations.<br /><br />Charlie lives in a sad world where his four grandparents have to share the same bed, they can't afford good meals or a better home. Nevertheless the boy is happy. Blake's illustration of Charlie displays an enchantment of someone who is happy on his own way. At that's the message of the book: be grateful for what you have -- even if it is not at much as you want, your luck may change some day.<br /><br />For adults, specially those who don't like books with message (myself included), this can be a silly thing. However, for kids, this is a valuable lesson taught throughout almost 200 pages with lots of fun. Dahl's book works as a metaphor of the world --albeit a perfect one, and not the real one. Again, this is not much of a problem, this idealization for young kids.<br /><br />Blake illustrations are an art apart. They perfectly translate into images Dahl's words and world. Mr Wonka is as weird as he could be. Charlie is cute and the Oompaloopas are strangely cute, too. The other kids and their family are enchanting -- albeit they are so problematic.<br /><br />\\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" is a book that still enchants more than 40 years after its first publication. Both kids and adults may find reasons to love it. The young ones will find another dream -- to have a candy factory for them --, adults will find a nostalgia of a time when they could dream of having their own chocolate factory.
B00005JNJT|5.0|We went and saw Batman Begins Wednesday night. I have to say, it was the best motion picture treatment of Batman, both the character and the story, I have ever seen. I have to give full credit to Christopher Nolan, who brought this film together. With his cast, which includes Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Tom Wilkinson, and Morgan Freeman (just to name a few), Nolan has woven a great, dramatic tale of the birth of Batman, making it seem an inevitable, logical conclusion of the tragedy that befalls the young Bruce Wayne, and enfusing it with a sense of realism which all of the previous movies did not have. Don't get me wrong, Gotham City has a taste to it which is not quite of our world today, but at the same time all of Batman's gadgets appear realistic, and Bruce Wayne suffers from a bruised and bloodied body following a hard night out as Batman.<br /><br />The direction and cinematography are excellent, from the opening frame (with the flying bats suggesting the Batman logo) to the closing frames (the remnants of Wayne Manor, and the conversation with Gordon). I appreciated how the first combat scene for Batman in Gotham kept Batman mostly out of sight, with only the sound of a flitting bat to suggest his prescence--an enemy out of sight often conveys more fear.<br /><br />The acting is superb as well. I do believe that Bale was an excellent choice for the lead; he brings an intensity to the role that others might have lacked. The supporting cast is all excellent, with a stand-out performance by Neeson, and a touching, human performance by Caine. Great choices here, all around.<br /><br />I'm going to have to see this movie again, perhaps in IMAX.

B00006GEXQ|3.0|Hugh Grant seems to have perfected the role of playing the spoiled young Rich person.    In many of his films, this is the role he has been cast into - and he has done a brilliant job at perfecting his character in each of these roles.   I've become a big fan of Hugh Grant's - not because of the characters he plays, but because he probably has become the top actor in his profession when it comes to Romantic Comedy films.   I was particularly excited about the film \\"About a Boy\\".   In addition to having the spoiled rich man in a Romantic Comedy, Grant was going to be able to demonstrate his talents opposite a young boy.   While this film did entertain me, I probably wouldn't put this film at the top of Grant's portfolio of film work he has done. <br /> <br />This film is basically divided into two parts.  In the first part of film, we see Grant as Will - a rich single bachelor who doesn't need to work and who enjoys the singles scene.  Will is content with his life.   Will gets the idea of pursuing \\"single moms\\", however Will intends fully to continue to \\"play the field\\" without getting bogged down into any commitment.  He even invents an imaginary son to help in his pursuit of single moms.    While dating a single mom, Will meets nerdy 12-year-old Marcus Brewer.  Marcus is the son of a friend of this particular single mom.   It seems that Marcus' mother Fiona is suffering from serious depression problems - and even tries to commit suicide.   Fiona's suicide attempt is unsuccessful, and following that - Marcus decides that Will would be the perfect companion for his mother.   Although Marcus' attempts at setting Will and his mother fail, Marcus soon develops a liking for Will as friend.  Thus, the first part of the film, we see a bond between to form between Will and Marcus. <br /> <br />In the second part of the film, things begin to change.  Will begins to pursue a woman named Rachel (played by Rachel Weitz), who also has a young son.   For the first time, Will begins to see things differently.   He begins to realize how shallow his life has been to this point, and that he may want to do more than just play the field.   Now it's Will who must enlist Marcus' help to win over Rachel.   Meanwhile Marcus is still having problems - coping with his mother's depression and trying to win over a girl he likes.   When things go sour with Will and Rachel, it's Marcus who calls on Will for help.  But Will is having self-doubts, and is not sure he can be there for Marcus.    <br /> <br />There are some good and bad things about this film.   For starters, Hugh Grant delivers another stellar performance.   While in movies such as \\"Nine Months\\", we've seen Grant able to pull of the physical comedy, this movie focuses more on Grant's dry sense of humor - and this comes off brilliantly.   One terrific scene is at the end of the movie when Grant comes on stage with Marcus and sings a duet of \\"Killing Me Softly\\".  It's a scene that you wouldn't expect from Hugh Grant, yet it comes off brilliantly.   One thing that is interesting is that the film is narrated from two perspectives.  The first perspective comes from Will.   Will narrates the story from his point of view and as he narrates it we see a transformation of the self-centered rich person who plays the field to the person wanting more out of life and being a responsible person others can rely on.   The second perspective comes from Marcus.  Marcus will narrate things and we see how he transforms from a nerdy kid lacking self-confidence, to a person who has gained self-confidence thanks to his friendship with Will.    Finally, I liked the fact that the movie was filmed in England.   I've always felt that Grant has been very strong when he is on his \\"home turf\\" - in such movies as \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\" and \\"Notting Hill\\", he has blended into the London scene perfectly. <br /> <br />As for the bad things.   I did not care for Nicholas Hoult's portrayal of Marcus.   I did not find Marcus theboy who would \\"warm our hearts\\" and be a scene-stealer.  In fact, I think it was almost delibrate that he wasn't a scene-stealer.   I found Hoult's portrayal as Marcus as one that would make the Marcus character unlikable - even though you feel sorry for him that he is dealing with a mother who suffers from depression.   There is a scene in the movie that leaves you hanging - it is when Will is in a liquor store and he has a memory of his father in the liquor store.   I know a point was trying to be made here about Will's background and character - but to me this scene should have either been removed or expanded on.   Instead, I found myself asking more questions.  <br /> <br />Finally, I did not like how the movie came to a conclusion.  I thought the setting of the school Rock concert was pretty weak - even though this was the setting for the scene where Will sings \\"Killing Me Softly\\".  But to me - there had to be a better, more emotional setting for a conclusion to this movie.  We've seen great conclusions in such films as \\"Notting Hill\\" and \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\", but this film seems to drop the ball.    I did like the \\"epilogue\\" to the movie - when we see how everything turns out. <br /> <br />Overall, I still did enjoy the movie.   If you are a Hugh Grant, this will keep you happy.   However, you probably will realize that this isn't like some of the other \\"Home Run\\" films (\\"Nine Months\\", \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\", \\"Love, Actually\\")  that Hugh Grant has been a part of.     It's still a movie worth checking out.
B000002UAX|2.0|Okay, you guys should already know the drill by now, but I'll fill in the other 5 or 6 of you that might not yet. Father's day is here and I'm reviewing 3 of my dad's favorite stupid, musty old records for his preasant. I did this for his birthday previously with Sgt. Pepper, Blonde or Blonde, and a stupid Beach Boys record. This time around, I'm going over the Stooges Fun House, this record, and Velvet Underground with Nico. I'm really not into all of this old crap, as you guys could see with the Birthday Trilogy, but whatever. He said that these 3 would be \\"more up my alley\\", but so far I'm just confused. Anyways, here we go again.  <br /> <br />Okay, great. Another Beatles record. Oh no, I mean TWO Beatles records in one. Didn't you get the hint LAST time dad? I will give you the benefit of the doubt, ONLY because on the Pepper record, you could tell just by LOOKING at them that it was a drug-party record. They were in a huge colorful dream-world with silly little colorful costumes. The music pretty much sounded like how the cover looked. THIS one on the other-hand is just a white cover that says The Beatles and has a number on it-a bunch of zeroes and then 1022. Is that the name of the record? Who cares. Alright, it's 2 records long and once again, there will not be any kind of stereo sound to it because this old relic is in...you guessed it, mono. You DO know what stereo is, right dad? Anyways, to shorten this review I'm going to listen to a side and then write about it afterwards. Maybe I will do the last side as it happens, so my review can end right when the stupid record does. And while I do this I'm going to color in the white cover with a sharpie to fool my dad. LOL! Okay, marker-caps off, put the swingy thing on the record, and...begin.  <br /> <br />Okay, just listened to the first side. Here's what I gathered from it. There was a cool airplane noise at the beginning, some fast-rock, some slow-rock, a weird island-bopper with really loud piano too. Thenthere was short burst of what sounded like screeching muppets. Then a cowboy-drug-song, a motorcycle rocker and a creepy gun-rock be-bopper. Now I have to turn it over, and I just got really discouraged because of how much I'm going to have to be doing this.  <br /> <br />Alright, side two. Where to begin. In no specific order, there were songs a lot of animal-rock songs about pigs and birds and raccoons (played like drugs were involved). A sleepy song about drugs and a bizzare honky-tonky fiddle jam. Then songs about girls. As a side-note, I have almost completely colored the whole outer-shell of the record black now, with my marker. Since I'm only half done with the music, I will begin coloring the inside out of sheer boredom.  <br /> <br />Alright, side three was pretty bizzare. It had a happy-birthday motorcycle rocker, a depressing blues-thing, a few slow songs thrown in, and a completely out of control song about a pet monkey, where it sounded like the guy was beating the crap out of a cow-bell, like his life depended on it. It was actually pretty neat. Makes me want to hit something with a stick like that. And there was this drug-freak-out that was out of control with screaming and out-of-tune guitars. They can't keep the music under control. They irresponsibly bash away, and someone yells about hurting his fingers. That's what happens when you recklessly play music like that, buddy. Anyways, every single inch of cardboard is now colored black, but with a bit of a purple sheen to it, because that's just how magic-markers are. This record is wasting sooooooo much of my time, but the end is near.  <br /> <br />Side 4, in progress now....a revolution-rocker..kind of boring....okay, a really embarrassing old-timey thing...why me? A funky food song...It's kind of got some chunky horns on it....another boooooring slow rocker called cry-baby....and now a guy is saying \\"number nine\\" over and over and over and.....wha!? What!?.....make it stop! Oh my god....there isthe most bizarre noises I've ever heard being made here...this is scaring the crap out of my dog (Morris) and me too...what the heck is going on!? How on earth to describe this? It's kind of like...imagine if..like a symphony was on drugs and went to an insane asylum...and got attacked by lunatics....and kind of kept on playin their instruments while being ripped apart...and then somehow wound up crashing through the wall of a classy english dinner party....who didn't notice what was going on and just went about their business....Oh my god!...it just doesn't STOP.....This music has induced a complete 5 Skull rating cloud-nightmare in my head. It's making me feel really ill. I know what it's like to be on drugs now. Either that, or Hades. It's getting so chaotic...worse...every...second.....WHEW! It's over. I feel completely drained. Morris peed on the basement floor. I guess he needed to get outside and I was stuck in a trance for nearly 10 minutes. That stuff could make you go crazy FOR REAL. This probably sounds NORMAL to people on drugs. Dad, if grandpa knew what you were listening to back then he would have beat the CRAP out of you. That made me feel worse than any Marilyen Manson song ever did. Don't ask me how, but that music WAS drugs. And to close it out, they cool it off with a soothing Disney-rocker, as if that could help you forget the cloud-nightmare. I don't feel good. By the way, the record looks really great in all-black. Later.  <br /> <br />howardtuttleman.com
B00003CXBK|5.0|I have had the privilege of seeing Miyazaki's \\"Spirited Away\\" and \\"Castle in the Sky\\" prior to \\"Princess Mononoke\\", and so far all of them stand up to his legendary status. There is not a single of his movies that I've seen so far, much less a moment through any of them, that you could do away with and criticize for being unnecessary.<br /><br />The story of \\"Princess Mononoke\\" gets you hooked within minutes, with animation and music that make you forget that you are not watching a live feature. The result of some of the landscape shots to the score by Joe Hisaishi result breathtaking and the voiceover of some extraordinary North American talent (Billy Bob Thornton, Claire Danes, Jada Pinkett Smith, etc.) makes the movie stand out even more, further helping bridge a cultural gap that was unthinkable to overcome years ago.<br /><br />In a nutshell, \\"Princess Mononoke\\" is a movie both you and your children will enjoy. It leaves you with a very powerful message about the struggle between the human race and nature, and how our \\"progress\\" has gradually done away with entire forests, resulting in animals loosing their homes and us loosing the benefits trees bring about. It is more than just an environmental message. It questions our motivations and puts things in perspective, showing how even those with the best intentions can eventually do wrong, causing harm to others. In short, check it out. Not to be passed.
B000005IU2|2.0|Okay guys, here's the situation. Father's day is here, so I'm going to do this again. For my fans that remember, on my dad's birthday last month, my preasant to him was to do a trilogy of reviews of his 3 favorite records (yeah, you read that right, records...ugh). Now I managed to struggle through Sgt. Peppers, Blonde in Blonde, and some dumb thing called Pets sound or something equally ridiculous. These reviews were the most taxing thing I have ever done. So here I am with another trilogy because dad's birthday is annoyingly close to Father's day. Dad says these 3 records will be more \\"up my alley\\". But make no mistake, I will pull no punches on these pieces of garbage, even though last time around, my dad wouldn't even speak to me or look at me for like 2 weeks. It wouldn't be fair to you guys if I wasn't honest and just pretended to like these things. Anyways, here we go.  <br /> <br />Okay, The Stooges. My dad says that he used to go see this band in concert back in a time that none of us care about. That's some pretty irrelevant information if you ask me. He said the concerts were \\"really wild and intense\\". This is comin from a guy that said he used to wear bell-bottomed pants and wear flower-prints back then. Nowadays it would probably be about as exciting as a Rockettes show. Whatever.  <br /> <br />Okay, the record-cover is red, and when you open it up you see....you see what appears to be 4 drug-addicted petty criminals, staring blankly at you. Not bizzarly-giddy in the Sargent Pepper kind of way either. More like the kind of guys who would shake-down kids for money, or eat out of the trash or something. It is obvious that at least 3 of the 4 of them have been to prison.  <br /> <br />Okay now, the music is playing and it sounds...well, it sounds pretty much like these guys look. Ugly. The first song starts out really strange and sporadic with drug-induced yelps and howls. Then it gets really rowdy and the guy yells a lot. Then back to the slower part. I can get some mental pictures going about this. I kind of picture this like a concept album already, and this song could represent the fate-ful first time these guys ever took their drugs, and how they started their journey towards becoming burnt-out criminals. The next song kind of furthers the story but in an even more dangerously unstable manner.  <br /> <br />I can imagine what is going on in the next song very vividly. It starts off with a desperate yell, that sounds like he is leading the charge of a drug-fueled rampage on the mean-streets of Detroit. I can imagine these guys cruising recklessly on motorcycles while swinging chains and bats at people, stopping only to shoot-up drugs and hold-up liquor stores. The next song slows everything down to a terrible grinding sludge. They seem to be on some kind of tranquilizer-type drug of something.  <br /> <br />Okay, I flipped the record over (ugh.), and now a song called \\"1970\\" just assulted my ear-drums. Wow! They are back to getting dangerously rowdy. This guy is yelling like crazy and telling you the year. The music is WAY out of line. This is music to kidnap-a-girl-to-and-tie-her-to-the-back-of-your-motorcycle to. Insane. And now, the next song is making everything all hazy and weird. Someone who is completely out-of-his-mind on drugs, is playing-a horn. He is so blown-out on drugs that he simply CANNOT keep this horn under control. This horn has nothing to do with the rest of the music. Man. I'm looking at the group picture again to try and see which one of these idiots could be playing the horn. It could be any one of them. This is so insane.  <br /> <br />Whoa! The last \\"song\\" just started. I don't even know what to say. Everyone is just playin WHATEVER they want now. It sounds like they have completely lost it, and are clanging their instruments together in various states of mind. This sounds like a war. And the horn-player.....The horn-player sounds like....It sounds like he's beating someone to death withhis horn. Oh man! The very end sounds like he's just swinging it around and hitting and bashing with the horn until he's so tired he just passes out. The whole second side of the record was like one big long cloud-nightmare. I guess dad was right that it is wild, but I'm not so sure that's a good thing.  <br /> <br />In conclusion, what the HECK, dad!? What kind of a teenager WERE you?! He doesn't need to listen to this ever again, and I'll make sure of that. He probably had a huge drug-habit back then, and the possibility of this record giving him some kind of murderous-drug-flashback while Me and Morris and mom are asleep, sounds highly dangerous. Anyways, I don't believe what I'm having to go through for a stupid little pseudo-holiday. Next up, catch me over at another Beatles review of an all white record, and then finally over at a record with a stupid-looking bannana on the cover. This is the only time my reviewing job gets boring. Later.  <br /> <br />howardtuttleman.com
0061015725|4.0|This is defenitly one of Crichton's better books.  I read it while traveling from Buffalo NY to El Paso TX, which was about 8 hours.  To me the end seemed a little forced which is why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5.  Up until then it is a defenite page turner that will keep you guessing and anxious to read the next page.  It has some scientific mumbo jumbo but defenitly not too much to turn off those of us who aren't that scientifically inclined.  Of course that's just my opnion, I could be wrong.

0440238609|4.0|Before i rattle on endlessly about the polar bear, Iorek, i'm going to try and write a review.  <br /> <br />The way the books are written really do give off a \\"dark\\" feeling from the get-go, but that may have just been me. Mainly about a girl named Lyra, but with a good amount of other charcters sprinkled in. And a polar bear, i mentioned that, right? The characters are complex and um, realistic, if you don't mind the fact some bears actually talk, as well as these familar-things i can't explain well. Oh and angels, and these mammoth like things that biuld houses. But even they are believeable. <br /> <br />This trilogy really is quite similar to other 'many worlds to travel to' books, but it's done oh so much better. But it's complicated so it's hard to summerize, not that i've ever really tried that.  <br /> <br />But aside from it all, the polar bear, Iorek, probably made me give this book four stars instead of 2. That chacter made me turn a blind eye to the other flaws. He's awesome. i shall shut up now.  <br /> <br /> <br />All good things come from those who wait, but you could always GET OFF YOUR BUTT AND GO FIND THEM! <br />-Unknown, but thanx.
0688172377|5.0|This book gives the reader a unique firsthand account of the terrible practice of Female Genital Mutilation, which is a common practice in many African countries and is found even in the USA. Reading about her misery and suffering during and after the procedure was performed on her, reveals to the world the horrors a girl goes through. She also reveals the longlasting effects is has had on her life and how she became a spokesperson against the practice for the UN. This is one of the most powerful social statements that I have ever read. Every person interested in human rights should put this book at the top of their must-read list.

B0009HLDFU|4.0|The album is split up into two discs - one that's heavy, raw, unadultered, and in your face; and one that is calm, shallow, and sways with the breeze.<br /><br />The first disc represents the heavier side of the Foo Fighters, but sometimes Dave's unneccessary shouting and screaming wrecks everything. For instance - the first song \\"In Your Honor\\", has a great melody, and a great riff to it. However, Dave shouts every word like a teenage rock anthem and it sounds horribly out of place. After 30 seconds of hearing the title track, I lose hope of the song ever recovering, so I usually skip over to track 2.<br /><br />In my opinion, \\"No Way Back\\" should have been the opener, with \\"In Your Honor\\" being a melodic feedback-laden intro to lead into Track 2. \\"No Way Back\\" is easily the heavy disc's best song, and I wouldn't be surprised to hear it get radio play in the near future. \\"Best Of You\\", which I'm sure everybody and their mother has heard by now, is a great song. I've heard many people complain about how it's \\"so repetative, so stupid, and I'm tired of hearing it on MTV all the time\\", but I think it's a great song. It has some interesting lyrics to say the least.<br /><br />The height of the heavy disc is probably the patch of putter green that consists of Tracks 2, 3, and 4. After D.O.A., things start to go down hill a little bit, and picks up a tad with \\"Resolve\\", but even Resolve doesn't quite impress me as much.<br /><br />I give the 1st disc a 3 1/2.<br /><br />The second disc is completely acoustic, bringing out the softer side of Dave's voice. \\"Still\\" talks about the simple life as a carefree adolescent, with lyrics like \\"together we can spend the day, follow me through the trees, I will lead the way... bring some change and some alcohol, we'll meet down by the bridge...promise me that I'll be forever yours...promise not to say another word\\", the song is very good and catchy to say the least.<br /><br />\\"What If I Do\\" is easily one of the strongest tracks on the soft disc. The finger-laden melodies of the rich Gibson Jumbo acoustic echo through your ears and Dave's soft sweet nothings top the cake with a fine layer of sweetness.<br /><br />\\"Miracle\\" is one of my favorite tracks on the album, because it's just catchy and easy to sing to. \\"Hands on a Miracle...I've got...my hands on a miracle\\". \\"Friend of a Friend\\" talks about johnny playing an old guitar with some corn found by the farm...and instantly he's a hero. \\"On The Mend\\" has an extravagant layer of multiple acoustics forming together to create a luscious melody that tickles your ears and grabs your heart. It's a very good song, and the Foo are very talented players. The rest of the songs are very catchy as well.<br /><br />The reason I favor the acoustic disc is because it brings an intimacy to the band and yourself that is otherwise hidden behind the walls of distorted guitar tone and cymbal-crashing rage.<br /><br />On disc 2, the boys sit down with a warm cup of coffee and sail away on their acoustic guitars, seeming to look you in the eyes and making conversation with every chord they strum. Disc 2 seems more thought out, intricate, and more complex (but in a good way, of course) than Disc 1.<br /><br />For this reason, and the sole reason on being more enjoyable alone, I give the 2nd disc a 4 1/2.<br /><br />All in all, \\"In Your Honor\\" is a nice mixing pot of hard rock and mellow ballads.<br /><br />Rating : 4 / 5<br /><br />have a nice day!ongest tracks on the soft disc.

I searched the internet and found that the \\"Somewhere\\" performed in the ad was done strictly for the ad so  I searched Amazon (don't you love the way you can find almost any song on Amazon) for versions of \\"Somewhere.\\"  This one by Phil Collins in fabulous.

B0007TKH66|1.0|I have never written a review on any of the Star Trek Series but I feel with this clunker people need to be warned. <br /> <br />I have throughly enjoyed and collected all of the Voyager series, and watched most of the Next Generation on TV.  Sadened by the ending of both, I was looking forward to this new entrant to the Star Tek family.   <br /> <br />Where do I start?  Bad scripts, apalling casting and the theme music summed up a \\"cowboy western\\" meets \\"miami vice\\"  shocker that lost me the moment it premiered.  Scott Bukula wins the award for the worst Star Ship Captain....EVER.  I felt as if TV execs had created this as a bad joke on their audience. <br /> <br />Take note those people who gave this a good review, this series was canned after its 4th (a difficult thing to do considering those of us who found the pace of DS9 unbearable).  This came as no suprise to those who were fans and those who weren't. <br /> <br />Don't waste your money.
B000067J1Q|3.0|Some movie musicals have aged better than others. THE SOUND OF MUSIC is not one of these. The fault lies in the music; not so much the melodies composed by the great Richard Rodgers, but rather the unpoetic treacle served up by Oscar Hammerstein as lyrics. In fact, all the other film versions of Rodgers and Hammerstein productions (The King and I, South Pacific, Oklahoma!) have dated rather badly for the same reason. All huge blockbusters when they were released, they all seem to suffer from a surfeit of lyrical over sentimentality when viewed today.<BR>     On the other hand, more modest musical productions have retained their freshness due in large part of their superior musical qualities. Before he teamed up with Hammerstein, Rodgers had forged a partnership with the infinitely more gifted Lorenz Hart. Their score of &quot;Showboat&quot;, or a potpourri of their compositions featured in &quot;Pal Joey&quot; illustrate how great music can elevate more modest productions. And let us not forget the contributions of such greats as Cole Porter and Irving Berlin, amongst others. Now those were fellows who could write witty and memorable lines as relevant today as when they were written. <BR>    But those awful Hammerstein lyrics! Without a bottle of good Scotch I don't think I would have been able to see this thing through to the bitter end.<BR>    This is not to say that THE SOUND OF MUSIC is without merit. The cinematography is breathtaking and Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer carry off their roles rather well. Robert Wise won the Oscar, but it is still quite a drop off in what he did for &quot;West Side Story&quot; four years earlier.<BR>    In all great musicals it is the music that makes the film. In THE SOUND OF MUSIC it is the lack of musical quality that made me cringe every time the cast looked ready to break out in song.<BR>    It is no accident that THE SOUND OF MUSIC marked the end of an era in movie making. The saccharine, artificial sentimentality of1950ish pop music as exemplified by Hammerstein's phoney lyrics was falling rapidly out of favour, even before 1965, and for many avid movie go-ers, THE SOUND OF MUSIC winning Best Picture honours was a real embarrassment.
B0001O3YC6|3.0|A transport ship crash lands on a dead planet with 3 suns. Among the survivors is an escaped murderer who was being taken back to prison. They discover an abandoned camp which includes a ship they hope to use to get off the planet. They also discover the planet is inhabited by nasty meat-eating creatures that live in darkness. Figuring they will be ok as there is no night on a planet with 3 suns, they are dealt another blow when a model in the abandoned camp indicates an eclipse is coming. When it starts, the planet it plunged into darkness for a long time and the millions of creatures come above ground. The movie becomes a story of survival as they use any source of light they can find to fend off the creatures to get to the ship and leave the planet. <br /> <br />I like the concept of this movie and it does a pretty good job of telling the story although it becomes predictable once the creatures emerge and the survivors have to depend on sociopath Riddick to lead them to safety. Once the creatures are brought into full view they're not that interesting and their is no real suspense. Except for one character, you pretty much knew who was going to live and who was going to die. Overall a worthwhile action/scifi/horror movie.
B00005JLEJ|5.0|Over a decade before Akira Kurosawa received funding to shoot Kagemusha he pondered the idea of multiple identities and how different personalities appear in different situations. This notion was in a mere stage of a fetus around the time when he finished Red Beard (1965), but the film left Kurosawa marked as damaged goods due to his oppressive perfectionism.  After this no one in Japan was willing to back him financially, but he did not give up as he attempted to create a production company with three other prominent directors from Japan.  He made the brilliant Dodesukaden (1970), but it was a commercial flop that ended his production company.  This was the ultimate death for his professional career in Japan, but through Hollywood he began to work on Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970).  However, he left the project due to artistic discord, which tarnished his reputation even more.  His life came to the ultimate bottom in December 1971 when he tried to commit suicide.<br /><br />As the Phoenix raised from the ashes, Kurosawa emerged from spiritual death when the Soviet Union invited him to make a film, Derzu Uzula (1975), which went on to win the Oscars for the Best Foreign film in 1976.  After the Oscars in 1976 to the shooting of Kagemusha in 1979, Kurosawa returned to his roots as a painter where he amassed a large number of paintings while being immersed into Shakespeare and Japanese history.  Kurosawa's paintings became advance storyboards for scenes in the film, which is loosely adapted from Shakespeare's King Lear and historical events from 16th century Japan.  This occurs as his story of multiple identities and personalities slowly brewed into perfection at his final stage as a film director.<br /><br />Kagemusha opens with the line, \\"Hmmm, he looks like me.\\", as the camera reveals three characters all having the same appearance.  In this lengthy introduction, the stationary camera reveals through minimal movements of the characters and the ongoing conversation that two of them are brothers and high ranking officials while the third is an unrelated thief.  The only thing giving away that the thief is a fake is his body language and his facial expression, but when he opens his mouth it is evident who are the leader and the thief.  Nonetheless, the similarities between them are striking in both their appearance and their lifestyle, but what makes the difference between them is that one of them holds the power of the province in which both live and he intends to use the thief as a body double.<br /><br />Shingen Takeda (Tatsuya Nakadai) and his brother Nobukado Takeda (Tsutomu Yamazaki), who took the thief as a double, are amidst a war trying to conquer the whole Japan in order to bring peace and no more bloodshed to the nation.  Shingen are currently besieging a castle, as they intend to strengthen their position to achieve complete peace.  During one late evening when the Shingen listens to one of the men playing a flute, a sniper injures him severely.  This causes the opponents of Shingen to wonder whether he is injured or dead, as he eventually dies.  However, before he died he made sure that they would keep it a secret for three years before revealing his death.  Throughout this time the thief, Kagemusha, becomes the stand-in ruler for the clan while they try to maintain their geographical position for three years.<br /><br />Some reviews have complained about the slow pace and the length of Kagemusha.  However, the length is necessary in order for the audience to completely immerse into the cinematic artistry that Kurosawa tries brings to the viewer through his ceaseless determination to create an experience.  Sure, one could kill time, as Jean-Luc Godard puts it in Band of Outsiders (1964) where the characters try to run through the Louvre in less than 10 minutes. However, the purpose of visit to the Louvre is not to merely for being able to say that one has been there.  Instead, it is highly recommended that one tries to take the time to understand what the artist attempts to say in each artistic work by pausing and reflecting over what they see.  Kagemusha offers a wealth of artistic images drawn from paintings that go beyond colors and lines, which compels further introspective contemplating work on self and society.  Thus, if the audience, expects to merely experience a sword fighting samurai film, Kagemusha will truly be a disappointment.<br /><br />An intertesting hypothesis could provide the notion that Kurosawa displays several of his own characteristics through his paintings, which later appeared in scenes throughout Kagemusha.  For example, there is the oppressive leader who demands perfection at all costs to the unwelcome thief.  Another interesting notion could be drawn from Shakespeare's King Lear where the king steps down from his position as king to later realize that it was a bad decision, as he is betrayed by his own daughters.  Then there is Gloucester who tries to help Lear, but is accused of treason and left to wander the countryside blind who also attempts suicide, but is saved.  The story of King Lear eventually ends up in tragedy, as does Kagemusha.  Maybe Kurosawa used King Lear, as analogy to his own life, not knowing the end.  This occurs as Kurosawa ultimately brings together all aspects of himself - past, present, and future.  Yet, as mentioned, he did not know his future, he went on to make and direct four more films including the masterpieces Ran (1985) and Dreams (1990).ies to take the time to understand what the artist attempts to say in each artistic work by pausing and reflecting over what they see.

0060922583|3.0|The first part of this book is fascinating as the author explains a theory of how the brain works like a hologram. Apparently if you cut a piece of holographic film, each piece still contains the entire object. The theory states that each section of the brain contains all of our memories and knowledge. Then it moves on to a theory of the universe as a hologram, stating that every electron actually contains all the matter and time of the universe. I'll admit I found the physics theory hard to comprehend. Fascinating, but hard to believe. These theories have been suggested by highly intelligent, well respected men in their fields which adds some gravitas to them. <br /> <br />The book started to lose me after this though. The author goes on to explain how you can perceive any number of phenomena through the lens of a holographic universe, including your health, miracles, psychokinesis, out of body experiences, near death experiences, stigmata and the list goes on. It started to sound like an infomercial  selling you on the merits of the holographic theory. The biggest problem was no real distinctive proof was offered. The book collapses under the weight of all the anecdotal evidence. Dozens of studies done by dozens of doctors are cited. Historical legends about mystics and holy men and women from the past being able to create things out of mid-air and leave their bodies whenever they wanted to. <br /> <br />I have always been fascinated by paranormal sciences and the possibility that it is possible to leave your body or see things of the future in your mind or that you can influence events just by thinking about it. But I haven't seen any real proof of much and this book doesn't offer it. The stories from 700 years ago can't be held accountable because of the length of time and the predilection for hyperbole from the people who recorded these events. The anecdotes from more modern history seem to be heavily from India and Indonesia. Why not more from industrialized countries? <br /> <br />By the end of the book you find out the author himself claims to have some of these paranormal abilities and then you realize why there isn't a counterpoint in the book. The author believes these theories whole heartedly and he's just  trying to get you to wise up. This is a well written book and at times fascinating and hard to put down. However, I would have liked a more balanced approach and more solid attempts at proof.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Fear comes crawling on occasion to all people, the question is how do they respond to this frightening sensation.  Many try to live with their internal fears without ever trying to deal with them, but once and in a while some decide to look fear in the eyes.  Some of these fears are phobias strong enough to paralyze the individual's existence, which could possibly be very dangerous if a situation would present itself where the stimuli that trigger the phobia would appear in an untimely moment.  These stimuli that cause fear could be things such as heights, spiders, or small spaces, yet they all have one thing in common.  They all induce irrational levels of fear.  In Batman Begins, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has such a phobia and how he acquires this phobia emerges in the opening of the film through a traumatic childhood experience.<br /><br />The story opens with a dream sequence where Bruce is playing, as a child, in their gigantic garden with Rachel Dawes, as he for the first time encounters bats through a traumatic experience.  When Bruce wakes up he is a captive of an Asian prison, seemingly Chinese, but this is not confirmed.  He is in prison due to his personal journey to gain wisdom about the nature of evil.  It also appears that he has enemies whereever he wanders, as convicts are willing to end his life whenever opportunity presents itself.  As a consequence, the prison guards throw him into solitary confinement where a shadowy man, Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), offers him the opportunity to fight evil in a more productive manner.  However, Bruce must follow the instructions of Ducard and undergo rigorous training where he must face his personal fears.<br /><br />Batman Begins opens with a fragmented storyline, which helps induce the confusion that Bruce might be feeling while trying to understand himself and how he should approach evil.  In this beginning, Bruce's past history runs before the audience's eyes through a number of interjecting flashbacks that present how he got to the situation where he gains the skills and wisdom necessary to battle evil.  Much of his wisdom and skill comes from intense training in ninjutsu and other martial arts while he is aptly ingesting all of the physical, spiritual, and philosophical parts of his training.  Intermittently throughout the training, scenes from his past emerge to increase an understanding of why he desires to combat evil.  The root of his desire stems from a harrowing childhood memory where his mother and father were brutally gunned down in his presence after having left an opera performance early due to fear experienced during the opera.<br /><br />The scene leading up to the murder of his parents continues to display director Christopher Nolan's attention for detail, as he also plays with the analogous notion that fear can prevent people from fulfilling their destinies.  The scene also illustrates the internalized guilt that Bruce possesses due to his fears that frequently haunt his dreams with his personal nightmarish nemesis - the bat.  However, Ducard teaches him that in order to fully be prepared to face his destiny he must conquer over his own fears.  This lengthy beginning is essential in order for the audience to build a complete understanding of Bruce's persona, as he struggles to understand himself within a diverse and unjust world.  Nonetheless, Nolan accomplishes to keep the audience's attention with his hypnotic storytelling that has splashes of wit and insightfulness.<br /><br />Eventually, Bruce finishes his education with Ducard, but finds himself at a crossroads where his personal philosophy opposes Ducard's organizations.  This leads him to take his own path, a narrow path, where he must struggle to be on the right side of justice.  In addition, when he returns home to Gotham City he discovers that he has been declared dead, as he has been gone for more than seven years.  Through the help of his family butler, Alfred (Michael Caine), he returns home to begin work in a small department of his company that is run by Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) from where he finds several of his fantastic Batman toys while he is trying to find a fitting symbol for his new alter ego.  After much thought, Bruce settles for the name - Batman.<br /><br />During Bruce's long absence from Gotham City, the city has disintegrated from rampant crime while corruption is reaching its peak.  The man behind the scenes seems to be the mobster Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson) who has a finger in everything within the city, but he is also cooperating with Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy), a psychiatrist, that gets off all of Falcone's thugs with the plea of insanity.  The police do not do much, as most of them are in the pocket of Falcone.  One of the few that seems to pursue the criminals is the attorney Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes), but without much luck.  Amidst this vile corruption Batman begins to restore peace and order within the city with his tough approach.  However, there seems to be something much bigger brewing underneath the surface of the city and Batman might be what Gotham City needs to save them.<br /><br />Batman Begins provides an authentic image of Batman's true dark character, as he struggles with what is right and wrong.  Through this personal struggle of Batman, Nolan does a wonderful job in depicting a genuine society where things are not black and white, as he brings the film into the gray zone where nothing is completely clear.  This ambiguousness is vital, as it also heavily deals with the emotion fear.  Fear is crucial for survival as people can sense dangers when facing fears, but if neglected it could lead to worse sorrow.  The camerawork and the darkness in the film enhances the element of fear in a brilliant manner.  There is a scene where the bats seem to merge with Batman, which symbolically produces the notion that fear is an essential part of our own existence and cannot be neglected.  When the darkness of the viewing room goes into hiding from the light and the end credits fade away Batman Begins continues to expand beyond any of its predecessors with a thoughtful and innovative cinematic experience not soon forgotten.artment of his company that is run by Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) from where he finds several of his fantastic Batman toys while he is trying to find a fitting symbol for his new alter ego.

1573223026|3.0|\\"A Long Way Down\\" is Nick Hornby's fourth novel and sadly, his least rewarding. The plot--which centers around four people accidentally meeting on a roof that they intend to jump off--is a gimmick. It gives us characters who are not integrated into the plot naturally, but are forced on us from the beginning. Unlike his earlier novels, which contained believable people in believable situations, \\"A Long Way Down\\" feels like the pilot for a sitcom. No sitcom would want to focus on the subject of suicide. Thus, \\"A Long Way Down\\" is not without thematic depth. What matters here is how much we care about the characters. Unfortunately, the only one I found that interesting was JJ, the frustrated musician. In JJ, Hornby again shows his strength for writing about a music lover that cannot succeed in love. We've seen such a guy before in \\"High Fidelity\\" and \\"About a Boy.\\" As a character, JJ works, but the others--Martin, Maureen, and Jess--disappoint. Martin (is it saying something that I had to look up his name again before writing it?), who has been shamed out of his job and his marriage, should be meaner. Hornby might have written him as, say, an older version of Barry--who did seem like the kind of guy who would commit suicide--from \\"High Fidelity.\\" And Hornby's attempts at writing from a female point of view, as was evident in \\"How to Be Good,\\" do not work. Jess too often feels as if she could just as easily have been a male, a fact not helped by her androgynous name. But what is more disconcerting is Hornby's decision to write idiomatic English. Jess has that Valley Girl, \\"like, oh muh Gawd,\\" way of talking, which is more annoying in print than in verbal conversation--where it is also annoying. Jess, at least, has personality, which is more than can be said for the bland Maureen. And Hornby would have done better to avoid cutesy asides. For example, every time a character swears (which is too often in this book) in front of the easily-offended Maureen, he/she makes sure to say, \\"sorry, Maureen.\\" One or two of these would have been enough. But Hornby, who is at least being consistent, repeats the joke throughout the book. For the most part, for such a short novel, Hornby has too much going on. The trip to the Caribbean and the supposed encounter with the angel, for example, are distractions that don't work at moving the plot along or developing the characters more fully. The book ends before I felt as if I knew these desperate people all that well. We don't get much insight into Jess's family life, for example. Nor do we learn much about Martin's stay if prison. What was it like? How did he feel before he slept with the fifteen year old girl that sent him there? Hornby, a very gifted and funny writer at his best (High Fidelity, About a Boy, Songbook) should set his sights higher in his next novel. He undoubtedly can entertain us. In his next book, I'd like to see him go for broke.sure to say, \\"sorry, Maureen.\\" One or two of these would have been enough.

B0009K7QZ8|5.0|I do not care what anyone has to say about the second season of The O.C. Bottom line, it was incredible. Throughout out the entire season, each episode kept you wanting more. Sure it may have had it set backs and may have been a lot different than season 1, but the second season morphed into more of a reality than a fantasy. You got to really get in touch with the characters, which was lacking in season 1. Also, The O.C. became much more \\"cool\\" rather than a sappy soapy drama. The introduction of the bait shop was key to The O.C.'s new cool appeal and Alex also added to this newfound coolness. Even if the show did get a rocky start in the beginning, you have to admit that the show needed that much time to solve all of the things that were left unsolved from season 1. Imagine how much we would not know if they immediately solved everything in the first couple episodes rather than having you wait so that they could solve every little detail. We would miss so much if they did not take the time to solve everything. The end of season 2 was incredible. The last couple of weeks were amazing and the producers could not have done it better. The ending was insane, but in a good way. This dvd is completely worth the money and you should buy it if you have seen all of season 1. It is well worth it.
B000HWZ5VU|5.0|Awesome solo debut from the Zeppelin giant.  Still to this day one of the best vocalists ever.  The album is great, Burning Down One Side I still listen to on a regular basis becasue it's so catchy and well written.  If you like Plant and his unique amazing sound you will enjoy this release.  True classic.

B00000JLWW|4.0|Titanic is a great movie, don't get me wrong. And there's nothing I wouldn't show to any kid above 12. There is a sex scene, but no nudity whatsoever and no gore. I think that, besides the aforementioned scene, the other thing that gave this movie a PG-13 rating was the intenseness of the movie. I definitely wouldn't let a 6-yr-old see this movie, because so many people die.            But if you're older, you won't be freaked out so much as sad. I was sobbing when they showed the old couple and the little kids with their mom, examples of how many people (mostly third- and second-class) were trapped in the bottom decks. The adults gave up trying to find a way out and tucked their kids in to bed for the last time. It was really sad for me, although my mom didn't cry. That's just her.      Titanic has its pros and cons-let me show you:    PROS:  1. A GREAT story, phenomal premise, the whole grandmother/young Rose thing. Whoever came up with that deserves serious recognition. The beginning, in the present, is my third favorite part. (see #5 and #6)    2. The music was superb. I'd give the overall way the music ties in and works with the story 4-4 1/2 stars. Just great. I have to get that Celine Dion song.    3. Just two words which automatically give this movie at least 4 stars: Leonardo DiCaprio. :) He may not be the very best actor ever, but he's one of the cute ones!    4. The love story between Jack and Rose was well done. 3 out of four stars.    5. My second favorite part was the flying scene with Jack and Rose. And the music was, as I said, great.    6. And now, for the best scene in the movie: my very favorite scene was one of the last when old Rose is sleeping on the ship and suddenly she's young Rose again, ascending the grand staircase while everyone who died on the ship comes back to welcome her. She reaches the top and there's Jack, waiting to kiss her. I bawled my eyes out.          ...Although, does that mean she died? Like when Jack said, \\"You're going to die an old lady warm in your bed, Rose,\\"?  Whatever. Decide for yourself. The scene was still great.    7. The unsinkable Molly Brown-she was really cool.    CONS:    1. This movie is three hours long, I warn you. And there are some parts that just drag on and on. But the rest of the movie pretty much makes up for it.          But other than that, I can't think of anything else that I disliked enough to deem it worthy of this review.            So there you have it. I strongly suggest you watch this movie. It's usually on at least once a month on broadcast channels.                                     I'm flying, Jack! I'm flying!

B00005JNJT|5.0|\\"Batman Begins,\\" superbly directed by Christopher Nolan, is a film that works on many levels, but above all, it makes a modern hero relevant again, much like Sam Raimi's spidey flicks.  We all knew Batman was awesome, we just needed to realize it again.  And no one could have done that better than Christian Bale, who was born to play the Dark Knight.  Exuding equal parts menace and wounded heart, he makes Bruce Waynes' familiar fear, anger and rage fresh again.  His fear and guilt stemming from his beloved parents murder is palpable and real.  At first, Bruce Wayne is in a Chinese prison, on a lifes' quest to understand the criminal mind, and how best to fight them and rid himself of the guilt that has haunted him for years. From this, a mysterious stanger named Ducard (Liam Neeson) plucks him and takes him into the Himlayan Mountains,  where he trains Bruce the ways of the League of Shadows, led by the nefarious Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe, given too little screen time).  Their goal is to purify the world through by purging it of wickedness.  Bruce jets the League when he is faced with the execution of a suspected criminal and makes his way back to Gotham where he seeks redemption by saving the city his father loved, now overrun by gansters and corruption, most of it personified in Carmine Falcone (a commanding Tom Wilkinson).  Working with his beloved butler Alfred (a heartfelt Michael Caine) and good cop Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman, in a role that finally gives Gordon something to do), Bruce goes to work to renovate the caverns underneath his house, collects hardware from scientist Lucious Fox (Morgan Freeman at his wryest and loosest) and builds a batsuit with which to turn his fear into a weapon against his enemies. <br /> <br />From the beginning, \\"Batman Begins\\" is fixated on fear, and how it can move or change a person.  One of the main villians is the Scarecrow (a creepy Cillian Murphy) a psychologist who scares the living crap out of people using a toxin that makes the person see what they fear most.  And Batman must fight them all by using his skills of manipulation to defeat them.  And although director Nolan leans a little too much on the jump cuts and close-up shots, the action scenes are among the brawniest, most bracing and innovate in recent memory, including an amazing car chase feauturing the souped up Batmobile and a climatic monorail fight between Batman and some old enemies from the League of Shadows.  But above all, Nolan and fellow screenwriter David Goyer focus on the characters an motivations in the bat story.  And even though the ending begs a sequel, the indulgence can be allowed.  After all, after resurrecting the Batman franchise in such rousing fashion, who can't wait for the next of Batman?

0060005696|5.0|I have just read a review of this book by Virginia Postrel. Her major point is that the great variety of choices we now have in many areas of life, increase our freedom and happiness. In the course of arguing in this way she makes an implicit argument for the intelligence and reason of most people. They will not spend years worrying about a choice in any area which means nothing to them. They will not spend years choosing a new product when they already have one in this particular line that suits them.<br />Still despite Postrel strong arguments(And there are others)it is clear that Barry Schwartz has  touched upon a central and important theme of human life in our time. The excess of choices and options within an area and between areas mean that we are often left confused and disturbed.<br />Here however I think that there is another point that Postrel makes which Schwartz is also aware of i.e. that being experienced in a particular realm teaches us how to cut out whole areas which otherwise would have disturbed us. I think a very good example for myself is in dealing with the Internet where it is possible to chase for hours one kind of misleading path to no- solution of the problem. With experience comes a knowledge of areas of interest, of sites that can be relied on, on how to use our time wisely.<br />However it does seem to me that there is a major cultural point about the nature of humanity, which is given in this world of superabundanct choice. I may be wrong but it seems to me that most people today are more scattered, more disordered and less able to really concentrate for long hours on one task. That is to say the whole background of our lives is endless distractions which make it difficult for us to shut ourselves off, and concentrate for the best type of work.<br />This is a thought- provoking work . I have unfortunately touched upon only a small number of the problems and choices in thought it raises.

0694003611|1.0|I know I am probably the only person in the world who will give this book a negative review but I honestly think the illustrations are very poor, I hugely dislike the black/white images on every other page, the bunnies look creepy instead of cute and cuddly like a bunny should look....and I don't like how the bunny says \\"goodnight to the old woman in the chair\\" or something like that and then on the next page or previous page, the chair is there and the woman is gone. It just feels spooky to me. Is it the bunnies grandma? Why couldn't it be \\"goodnight to my grandma or mom who is sitting in the chair whom I love or who loves me\\"? or something sweet like that? Instead, the whole book has this strange feeling to it and I just do not like it at all. And again, to go out on a limb, I think Margaret Wise Brown books tend to be like this- they are so close to being cute books and have that cute/catchy idea but then when you read closely or look at the photos, there is always a spooky undertone- a mouse beside a clock but inside the clock is a face of a cat that looks evil like it will eat the mouse and then you notice that the mouse's face actually looks scared. Why would I want to read these kinds of books to my kids?? This book gets my biggest thumbs down for a goodnight book or a book for kids in general.

Keanu is pretty bad in this film and it's apparent that this was an attempt to cash in on his Matrix success and some of the things that happens in the film including the over blown ending are scenes taken directly from the Matrix films. It seems to me that they were trying to establish another franchise with Keanu but this film really does not deserve a follow up. There are some good thing to say about it like the performances of Rachel Weisz, who does do far more for this film with her great and powerful performance than it does for her and Peter Stormare, whose tem minute cameo has more meat and soul than most of the performances of the film (with the excerption of Rachel Weisz of course) . Other than them, the movie is really a vanity project for those who are looking to cash in on the Matrix movies.  <br /> <br />
B00062RCBW|5.0|<br />To DMORG \\"DWM\\": <br /> <br />I agree with you.  The Star Trek series are great, but the DVDs are just too expensive.  They cost twice as much as the other series.  The Star Trek DVDs average $100 per season while all the other series are priced at approx. $50 per season.  I just wish they could lower the price for the Star Trek DVDs.
B00005JNJT|4.0|Fantastic come back for the film series with Christian Bale as the Cape Crusader starting his war on crime. Christopher Nolan recreates the series with a dark mood that almost rivals Tim Burton's first two Batman movies but he does lack the flare and the bravado that Burton brought to those films as well as the underlining sense of evil that Gotham had in it's core. Nolan meanwhile does give a sense of realism to the madness of the city and it's hero and that's where the movie big surprise is. I think that this is a great come back for the series and I hope there will be a sequel to it to see where Batman goes from there.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|The crux of the film was a little disappointing to me at first, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized how sad the story actually was. Once you start to realize what is going on and why things are the way they are, you may be a bit let down, but underneath is a story of a man dealing with buried guilt for something I can't mention. At first it showed only on the outside, but then his mental state starts to break as we watch him battle his alter ego and which direction he should now take. Left or right? Finally, he gives in and takes the \\"right path\\" and maybe will get some sleep. Anyhow, this is a very well done and highly stylized film, I was not bored at any point in this movie. One thing it did not really need was the constant swearing, I mean who swears that much and why? It just gets old after awhile. Great film otherwise. Christian Bale may be one of greatest actors of all time!
B000067J1H|1.0|Wow, violence exists, people can fight and they can get hurt and learn things about themselves! But don't talk about it! People who are impressed by this movie might want to read a few books instead of trying to learn life lessons from bad movies.  <br /> <br />If it weren't for prepubescent males with more testosterone than brain cells, this movie would have received no attention at all. A nice performance by Norton, but nothing else to recommend it. Those individuals who have written reviews stating that this movie is thought provoking or intellectually intense clearly are lacking any substantial intellectual horsepower.  <br /> <br />The book, while nothing special, is infinitely better than the movie.
B000065PUE|5.0|I've had this album for well over 5 years now, and I still haven't got tired of listening to it! The best song on it(in my humble opinion) is,\\"Hey\\" which just defined the pixies to me - But Debaser,Tame, Wave of Mutilation, I bleed, Here comes your man,Mr Greives, There goes my gun and Gouge away (so that's pretty much the whole album...) are all classics - that would be considered the pinnacle of almost any other bands album.  <br />The only iffy songs i can think of are la la love you and Silver. but hey maybe that's just me. Anyhow - if you need an introduction to a truly fantastic and disgustingly underplayed band, BUY THIS ALBUM. You won't regret it!
B00005JNNZ|3.0|Samuel L. Jackson is like a whirlwind unto himself, and it's hard too deny his presence in any movie he's in -- even when he's playing an understated, \\"quiet\\" role such as that of Jedi Master Mace Windu in \\"Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith.\\"  <br />\\"Coach Carter\\" would be your typical, run-of-the-mill movie, except this one had Jackson in the lead role. No, the movie doesn't rise much above elements you've seen in other school sports movies -- \\"Friday Night Lights,\\" \\"Stand and Deliver,\\" and even parts that reminded me of \\"Lean on Me\\" and \\"Remember the Titans.\\" And as a whole, it's simply yet another feel-good, popcorn flick.  <br />But it's still fun to watch, and it's hard to deny the movie's basic message -- that an education is more important than sports in that it carries you into the future, whereas sports is more often than but an unlikely \\"hoop dream.\\"  <br />So, anyone who hasn't seen this yet, see it for Samuel L. Jackson's powerful, charismatic performance. <br />As a big Jackson fan, this one will likely be finding its way into my collection, if only to skip ahead to see SLJ once again show the undeniable force of nature that he is.
B0007GAERG|5.0|In your face Enimem for poking fun at her in the past. Every thought Mariah Carey's career was finished after her (Glitter) CD was a joke. The Emancipation of Mimi ablum reminded people what a good artist she is. The song \\"We Belong Together\\" is talking about her getting married.
B000000WA4|5.0|id listen to this album at night and it would give me the best dreams.  This album contains some of the best melodies of all time.  this is the best double album since the WHITE ALBUM.
B0007M22TI|5.0|The first singer on the DVD is Chole, a 15 year old with a voice that should be illegal for someone her age.  What an amazing voice.  Next up is Meav with a rendition of \\"Danny Boy\\" that is one of the best arrangements and performance of this classic song I have ever heard.  Then we get treated to the instrumentalist of this group, Mairead.  She dances around a lot (I would guess that comes from her being the lead solo violinist for \\"Lord of the Dance\\"), but she can play the fiddle.  Then we are introduced to Orla, another angelic voice singing a traditional Celtic song.  Then the four join up together for a beautiful arrangement and rendition of \\"Jesu Joy of Man's Desiring\\".  After I heard it for the first time I said this song is worth the price of the DVD by itself.  Next up is the fourth vocalist of the group, Lisa, singing \\"May It Be\\" from \\"Lord of the Rings\\".  I could not believe it.  After hearing three fantastic singers, Lisa blew me away.  I felt her voice was the best of all.  Then Orla comes back and sings a haunting traditional Celtic song and accompanies herself on the harp!  And it goes on like this.  Track after track of amazing music from these talented women.  There is not a bad track on this DVD.  You do not have to be a Celtic music fanatic to enjoy this DVD.  There is a good mix of different styles of music. <br /> <br />The DVD is well done in my opinon, although I'm sure there are some who will find flaws in it.  It does not employ the 3 second edits that I have seen in other DVDs of live concerts that drive me nuts.  Instead the camera spends most of time on the performers with quick shots to the orchestra or instrumentalists usually during instrumental breaks in the singing.  You get to enjoy seeing the beautiful women that these beautiful voices belong to.  There is not a lot of extras, biographies and short interviews with the performers.  The interviews do give depth to the performers, though. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this DVD so much it inspired me to write my first review.
0790729652|5.0|This is the Batman i will always remeber, although the joker is a bigger part of the film. Tim Burtons 1989 version of Bob Kane's dark comic book hero is the best Batman movie ever made no matter what critics say.  At the time i thought Burton was a bad choice, but i was wrong.  After this film Burton would make some of his best films Edward Sissorhands, Batman Returns and Nightmare before christmas.  Each of those films has a gloomy yet colorful production, But BatMan is Dark, really dark and somewhat depressing.  Michael Keaton is great at Batman but he owns the Bruce wayne role, he plays him troubled and quiet.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson's Joker is the greatest villan in comic book movie history.  Nicholson is having so much fun with this part you cant help but to love him and hate him.  The new Batman film is good but is missing a few things: A Great score, Fun, Adventure, a good villian, and sillyness that made Burtons film so entertaining.  The movie is so good that it will give goose bumbs by the end.  If it was released today i think it would still be a hit.  Some say that the movie shows us the orgin of bat man. Yes it does but it offers nothing else, no sense of discovery, no joy, no fun.  Ill take Tim Burtons version over Nolans version anyday.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Let me just start by saying that Batman Begins is not only the best Batman movie ever made, it's also the best movie of the year. Batman Begins goes for a really dark gothic look with director Christopher Nolan (Memento) looking deep into the Dark Knight's life before he became a hero. Christian Bale plays Bruce Wayne/Batman and he is absolutly perfect for the role, Alfred Pennyworth, Bruce's butler, is played by Michael Caine, Gary Oldman plays Sargent Gordon, Katie Holmes plays Bruce's love interest Rachel, Liam Neelson plays Henri Ducard, the man who trained Bruce while he was in Asia and the science whiz Lucius Fox is played brilliantly by Morgan Freeman. It's been nearly seven years since Bruce Wayne left Gotham City disgusted by the corrupt society. He goes to train with a man by the name of Henri Ducard, and meets the sinister Ra's A Ghaul (Ken Wantabe, The Last Samurai). He must face all of his darkest fears including his parent's death and his fear of bats. After his training is over he heads back to Gotham to restore justice to the people. But as Bruce returns he sees that Gotham is more corrupt then ever and he must strike fear into his enemies, thus the Batman is born. When a mob boss who Batman has apprehanded goes mentally unstable, the Scarecrow is to blame. With a great story with many twists and turns, Batman Begins is defiantly a movie that shouldn't be missed by Bat-Fans and people who are just looking for a great film.
B0000C6K09|1.0|I thought that the music quality was fine, but the music did not sound the same as the music in the original soundtracks.  John Williams does not conduct his songs on these CD's. I could hear differences between songs I allready own and songs on these CD's. It seemed like the conductor on these CD's interpreted the music differently and therefore the music did not sound the same. I did not like that I could hear the difference between the original soundtracks and the songs on these CD's. I also found an error with one of the song names.  Instead of Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone, one of the song names was Harry Potter and The Philosopher's Stone. I would definitely recomend the original soundtracks over this set of CD's.
B0006L16N8|3.0|Not to be rude to Mr. Martin, but a band's raison d'etre changes when what was attained becomes reality. Coldplay produced a great sustaiable album (no mean feat) when they released AROBTTH, but this new album faces challenges that the casual Cldplay fan might expect, and more. Firstly, you are expected to live up to - not alone surpass - your last album; secondly, Martin is supposed to keep his \\"music for the massses\\" sensibility after his marriage and fatherhood.   <br />The songs are elegant and climactic, yet without soul. Many of us had heard of the tortured songs they'd disregarded - two album's worth - before coming up with X&Y . I only hope that they're worthier and surface later.  <br />I felt that the band was in trouble when \\"Speed of Sound\\" was released. While by no means the weakest song on the album, it was a strong portent of an album that could have been better. <br />Overall, Coldplay's X&Y is still a well-crafted album, but very forgettable compared to its predescessors.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|The music is great if you listen to it on your stereo or in the car, but good luck trying to listen on your computer or mp3 player. It's like some Soviet era program that makes it just about impossible to do anything with the CDs.  I PAYED FOR THESE CD'S!!!!! and I can't listen to them in Winamp without jumping through 20 hoops and there's no way to get them to work on my MP3 player!!!! I'll never make that mistake again. I'll just download the songs from sharezaa from now on.  Shame on the Foo Fighters to agreeing to this BS!
B00025ETIW|2.0|Ok, I have to tell you, I have only heard one song by My Chemical Romance.  As you probably have deciphered from the title of this review, that particular song happened to be \\"Helena.\\"  I heard this song by seeing the video off of MTV.  Personally, I found it a bit obnoxious.  The lead singer of the band, Gerard Way (who I think looks a hell of a lot like The Smashing Pumpkins Billy Corgan) looks as though he is about to break into tears throughout the majority of the video.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm not slandering this band, saying that they \\"suck\\" and trying to persuade you not to buy \\"Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge.\\"  Here is what I recommend; Listen to some samples off of Amazon right now!  If you like the music, then I say you should pick up a copy of the new album.  If you do not care for My Chemical Romance, like I do, you should not purchase a copy.  Remember, I have only heard 1/13 of the album.  This is certaintly not enough to judge and I know that I could not do any better myself.  Why don't you give MCR a try?  Give 'Em Hell, Kid!
B0001XAPY2|5.0|I'm no student of animation but I have , like most americans grown up watching movies. Porco Rosso, is a wonderfully gorgeous <br />movie punctuated throughout with breathtaking views of the not-so-long ago past.  <br />Like any decent novel, it operates on different planes making it a superb family film. Frankly, this movie suits me much better than \\"Castle in the Sky\\". <br />
B00025ETIW|4.0|i think my chemical romance is a pretty good modern punk/emo/hardcore band. i first heard of this band when i tuned into a radio station and the dj said that this as one of his favorite bands and i heard the single I'm Not Ok (I Promise)a couple days later.  i liked it the first time i heard it and it eventually became one of my favorite songs on the radio.  months later i switched my tv to MTV and saw the Helena music video.  Gerard Way looks like he is about to cry throughout the song which is proof to me that he doesnt mindlessly sing about the sadness that he does.  my personal favorites on the album are Helena, Give Em' Hell Kid, I'm Not Okay, Thank You For The Venom, It's Not a Fashion Statement(,)It's a Deathwish, and i Never Told You What I Do For a Living.  the only thing that kept me from giving this cd 5 stars is that I can't really listen to it when I'm angry, and I have listened to it so many times, that all the depression kind of gets boring......its a great cd though buy it!

B0002IQNAG|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I cant begin to review suck a masterpiece as this movie is. In fact, I shouldn't be allowed too review this. But this film being one of the best \\"if not the best\\" zombie films of all time, I have to put in my two cents. So here I go........ <br /> <br />When there is no more room in hell..... The dead will walk the earth. The quote that has stuck in the horror community and will continue to be known well into the future. <br /> <br />This movie is easily in my top 5 favorite movies of all time. It has gore, violence; sadness, GREAT STORY, and it give you real sense of desolation and struggle. <br /> <br />You can really connect to the characters and feel their pain. (Well at least I did) <br /> <br />Its bad ass because after all the trouble they had with the clearing out the mall of all its zombie loungers, and loosing a man (which still makes me sad watching it to this day) \\"Roger.... I salute you\\". They than have to battle a group of biker looters. <br />And the special effects lord \\"Tom Savini\\" makes a cameo as the biker leader. <br /> <br />I mean this movie is bad. There's conflict between the main character, \\"differences in plans etc.\\" battles with hordes of the undead, and fighting human enemies. <br /> <br />This film also shows classic scenes. For example: when a zombie stands on a box at the airport and gets the top of his head slice off by the groups helicopter blades. Or when Willy \\"swat cop\\" opens an apartment door and blows off \\"a normal man\\" a poor black buys head with a shotgun. <br /> <br />Anyway apart from having a great story, it has relatively good acting, great effects, has a really cool music score and just a great all out movie. <br /> <br />Romero is truly a great writer and director.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Like another reviewer, I have had this CD for a while now, since it first came out.  Although most people probably know the hits from their first album, this one totally blows that one away!  I love every song, and never get tired of listening to them.  I can never decide which song is my favorite.  I consider myself a music lover, no matter what kind it is, as long as it's good.  This album gets put in my top 10!  All songs are catchy, and of course Darren's voice is simply superb!!!  Highly recommended to anyone :) <br />\\"This intoxication thrills me...I only pray it doesn't kill me.\\"
B0006L16N8|4.0|It's 2005, and Britain's biggest bands have released new albums, one of which is Oasis' Don't Believe The Truth and the other, of course, is Coldplay's X&Y.     X&Y is part 3 in the magnificent musicianship and lyricism of Coldplay. Parachutes and A Rush Of Blood To The Head are not distant sounds from the tracks on X&Y. In fact, Coldplay don't try to experiment or push their noise a bit further from what has now become known as the Coldplay style of mellow rock that will quite oftenly put you to sleep. However, they do borrow some musical ideas from bands like U2 and others. Most importantly though, on X&Y Chris Martin delivers another batch of soft rock popsicles that will be as sweet to you as strawberry cheesecake.     The opening track Square One dwells into Radiohead/Pink Floyd land with its atmospheric music and deep lyrics. White Shadows and Talk are obvious inspirations from U2 with their screaming guitars that only The Edge is best at. Coldplay sweetness can be heard on What If?, A Message, Low, and Fix You, a song that's begging to be a hit single. The album's first single, Speed Of Sound sounds a little like Clocks but is a Coldplay classic in its own right with its catchy tune and chorus.     At a time when most bands produce a really bad album, go over the edge with production, or simply fade away, Coldplay plays it smart and simple with their third studio effort at a rate where you can almost gaurantee that they will be around for a longer time than expected.     Track Picks:    Fix You  Talk  Speed Of Sound  A Message    Recommended     B
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Woah, this CD is one of my favorites out of my collection. I am only 14, but I am a die-hard Beatles and Elvis fan. The song that really got me interested in the Beatles is \\"Let It Be\\". My other two favorites are \\"Penny Lane\\" and \\"Yellow Submarine\\". On this CD, 1-6 are awesome songs as well.
B0007ZEBIK|5.0|Simple Plan's second original CD, \\"Still Not Getting Any . . . \\" gives its legion of fans no letdown after the long wait for the second CD. If anything, it is an improvement on the first. <br /> <br />Fans at their shows have already been introduced to \\"Welcome to My Life\\" and \\"Shut Up!\\", both good, catchy songs just packed with the adolescent angst that is SP's trademark. \\"Shut Up!\\" in particular, shows the band's knack for combining downbeat lyrics with upbeat tunes, in a song which I interpret as a teenager's thoughts while being lectured by his parents. <br /> <br />Something's changed a bit from the first CD, and that's the band's perspective. Many of the songs on \\"No Pads, No Helmets, . . . Just Balls\\" had the perspective of a teen complaining about a poor relationship with a parent. There's still a bit of that in songs like \\"Me Against The World\\" and \\"Shut Up!\\", but this time, more songs talk about a romantic relationship gone bad (for example, \\"Perfect World\\", \\"Everytime\\" and \\"Thank You\\"), and the perspective is more young adult than teenager--\\"Everytime\\" talks about the partner waking the singer at 3 a.m. and driving to dawn--not likely if still living at home. The band's characters are maturing, as is their music. <br /> <br />Other notable songs include \\"Crazy\\", a throwback to Reset's (the predecessor band to Simple Plan) socially-conscious songs, and \\"Jump\\", plainly intended as a concert song but very strong in its own right. <br /> <br />Perhaps the strongest song on the CD is \\"Untitled\\", a downbeat song with downbeat music, the dying thought of someone who doesn't know why he's dying, and despite the people around him, is dying utterly alone. The sadness which runs through many of the band's works is here in full strength. Softer than usual and using a piano (shades of \\"Meet You There\\" on the first CD), even if never released as a single, it may well be the band's best song to date. <br /> <br />While lead singer Pierre Bouvier did almost all the singing on the first CD, much more is heard from backup singers Sebastien Lefebvre and David Derosiers do a lot more of the singing here, and they are well worth listening to. <br /> <br />Extras on the DVD side include film of the guys, almost an extension of the DVD \\"A Big Package For You\\" <br /> <br />Highly, highly recommended.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Man, Elvis is definitley the KING!!! He rox, and anyone who doesnt like him has got problems. My WHOLE family are Beatles fans except me and my daddy-we are Elvis fans. Thats why my name is Sissy Garon Aron Presley. Sissy is just a simple nickname (but its my real name. He figured why name her something like Corrina when I am just gonna call her Sissy) Garon is Elvis's stillborn twins middle name. Aron is Elvis's middle name. And Presley, common people, you have to know were in the hell that came from!!! I am only in 10th grade, and everytime someone hears my name, I alwayz have to explain, but I dont mind. Its all for the king!!!
B0000029AP|5.0|Toys in the Attic is the greatest album ever made. Each song on this album is awesome. Aerosmith wrote some of their best work on their 1975 album, everyone knows Walk This Way (the only song I can thing of to be considered great in two different music genres) and Sweeeeeeeeeeet Emo-tion. The title track on this album is probaly my favorite Aerosmith song ever, and of course listen to the best double meaning song ever \\"Big Ten Inch Record\\" <br /> <br />Buy this album, there is no way you can hate Aerosmith.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|For the most part, this is one sharp crime thriller that doubles as a character study of two lonely men. If that premise does not appeal to you, then you probably can't appreciate director Michael Mann's unique filmmaking style, which is an intoxicating mix of nocturnal urban sleekness and characters that peel off layers of their psyche to drive the plot. This is not a standard action film, not by a long shot, as it is really about the relationship between a hit man named Vincent and a cab driver named Max, thrown together by chance and becoming more inextricably connected as the convoluted story unfolds. Vincent is as mono-maniacally cold-blooded as one can expect in this type of film, but Stuart Beattie's script reveals a well-educated, rather erudite man who may have been triggered by an abusive childhood to follow this line of work. In salt-and-pepper hair and without his trademark smile, Tom Cruise is relatively good as Vincent, though as with most of his films, there is an air of posturing about his performance that negates the malice of his character. At the same time, when it comes to his character's profession, he is convincing as an expert at his craft, who has mastered a clear method of killing that absolves him of blame and conscience.<br /><br />The focal point of this 2004 film, however, is Max, who represents the story's moral conscience. He is also a complex figure, a man who has deluded himself with dreams of running his own limousine service. Max makes it sound convincing at first, but then his credibility starts to unravel under Vincent's astute microscope and as the immediate situation becomes more desperate. Consequently, he is forced not only to drive Vincent around LA but also to look at himself for what he is. Were it not for his uncanny impersonation of Ray Charles, this is the performance that would have pushed Jamie Foxx to the front ranks. As Max, he captures all the inner conflict showing surprising pockets of courage when he realizes he has nothing to lose. The interplay between Vincent and Max is what makes this film uniquely intriguing, as it is just not about a villain holding a reluctant victim hostage but about two men who leverage each other's blind spots and weaknesses to fulfill their immediate goals.<br /><br />Too infrequent on the screen recently, Jada Pinkett-Smith is sharp and memorable in a small but pivotal role as Annie, a federal prosecutor who gets drawn to Max at the beginning. Mark Ruffalo, taking a break from indies, is effective as the slicked-back LA detective who is not sure who his suspect is. Irma P. Hall has a briefly comic scene as Max's bedridden mother. Special mention needs to be given to the wondrous Javier Bardem, who takes a 180-degree turn from his recent saintly roles to play a single scene as the drug kingpin Felix, coolly menacing as he talks facetiously about Humpty Dumpty, Santa Claus and Black Peter. The scene between Foxx and Bardem is superbly played out as Max gradually steels himself into Vincent's identity. Mann's set pieces - in a scary Latin bar, in a frenzied Koreatown dance club - show the director at the height of his stylized creativity, and nighttime in LA has never looked more terrifyingly hypnotic than in the excellent camerawork by cinematographers Paul Cameron and Dion Beebe.<br /><br />It's a shame that the film gets more predictable toward the end when Vincent becomes his most nihilistic and Terminator-like and Max unconditionally heroic. In a fit of derivativeness, the story suddenly borrows heavily from \\"Rear Window\\" and \\"Speed\\" with a touch of \\"The French Connection\\". Although the cumulative effect is still suspenseful, the familiarity of the climax left me feeling a little empty especially after the plot was unfolding in such an audaciously creative manner. But I still recommend this movie for its overall originality. The two-disc set has plenty of extras - Mann's informative commentary, a feature-length making-of documentary, an interesting prep reel of Cruise and Foxx getting into their roles and just one deleted scene. Well worthwhile even if you are not a fan of this genre.se and Foxx getting into their roles and just one deleted scene. Well worthwhile even if you are not a fan of this genre.
B00005JNJT|5.0|I've never been much of a comic book fan, but there have definitely been superheroes that have intrigued me over the years.  From the Marvel universe, I have found myself drawn to the character of Spider-man, while DC's Batman is my favorite hero from that universe.  So far, both of those heroes have gotten (for the most part) great film adaptions.  Both Spider-man movies have been amazing, while the Batman films under the directorship of Tim Burton have been great.  The third one was enjoyable (to me at least), while the fourth was terrible; a very campy thing in the vein of the 60's TV show.  So I guess that any halfway decent Batfilm would look good after that flop, so the fact that Batman Begins is in fact great (possibly my new favorite Batman movie) is all the better. <br />This movie has effectively restarted Warner Bros.'s Batman franchise.  Robin hasn't shown up yet, James Gordon (Gary Oldman) is still only a lieutenant, and the Joker is still a petty criminal (nowhere near his status as the Clown Prince of Crime).  Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale), the son of Gotham City's greatest benefactors, has been spending time in prison in order to beat on the criminals housed within.  A two-bit thug killed his parents right before eyes when he was just a kid, and he wanted revenge, but circumstances prevented it.  Now his anger drives him to attack criminals of all kinds in order to avenge his parents.  Soon however, he meets a mysterious man named Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) he introduces Wayne to the mysterious Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanbe) and he begins training Wayne martial arts and dramatic theatrics.  This training allows Wayne to manipulate the fears of his enemies and become a crusader against crime in Gotham City, which has degenerated into a crime-ridden hell where gangsters like Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson) run everything.  In a way, it's almost poetic that the film was shot in Chicago, seeing as how some friends of mine see Gotham as a parallel to Chicago,if things had gone differently back in the 30's (and hey, they refer to Gotham as \\"man's greatest city\\", which accurately describes Chicago). <br />Upon his return to Gotham, Wayne moves back in with his childhood butler, Alfred Pennysworth (Michael Caine), and reunites with his old friend Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes), who is now an assistant District Attorney.  He also meets up with Lucious Fox (Morgan Freeman), who is a sort of Q type character who provides Wayne with all of his bat-gadgets, including the batarangs, the body armor in the batsuit, the cape, and the batmobile (which is still awesome, even though it's an SUV instead of a sports car). <br />Aside from Ra's Al Ghul, we also get the Scarecrow/Dr. Jonathon Craine (Cillian Murphy) in the villains department.  Since he's one of my three favorite Batvillains (the others being the Joker and the Riddler), I was very happy to see him in this film.  I think that the Scarecrow can be pretty cool if done right, and this movie definitely did him justice (unlike Two-Face or Mr. Freeze in some of the older films).  The only thing is that they didn't really go into his backstory, which I find interesting.  However, this movie was already 2 1/2 hours long, and the main focus was on Batman himself.  This is actually the first Batman movie where Batman was the star of the film!  In all of the previous ones, the villains were the ones who got more attention; in the first Batman, Jack Nicholson even got top billing over Michael Keaton, even though Keaton played Batman and Nicholson played the Joker. <br />The main theme of the story was fear (which made the Scarecrow a very appropriate villain).  It was about mastering fear, using fear to fight, and using fear to destroy.  For those of you who don't know, the Scarecrow developed a serum that induces a paniced state in people who breathe it in, forcing them to see the things that they fear most, which led to some pretty cool sequences. <br />It was pretty cool to actually see Wayne discover and prepare the batcave for use, along with being trained, both of which were passed over in the original Batman movie.  In that one, Wayne was already Batman, and while we know that his parents were killed, we never saw all the hell that he went through to go from Bruce Wayne to Batman.  In Begins, however, we see all the torture that occured that had to happen in order to create the Dark Knight. <br />For a comic book movie, the acting was exceptionally good.  Caine, Freeman, Murphy, and Neeson did the best in my opinion, in their respective roles.  Bale did a great Bruce Wayne/Batman, and Gary Oldman was great as a good guy (no, I am not lying; Gary Oldman plays a good guy in this movie).  Holmes was fair, but her good looks made up it. <br />This is a film that everyone can enjoy, whether you are a Batman fanboy or a casual film viewer.
0679423001|5.0|\\"Brideshead Revisited\\" is the kind of novel that seeps into your skin and bones just from scanning a few pages, and when read at length can fill your head for days with the language and vision of the lost world author Evelyn Waugh conjures back from the dead. Yet its sharp insights on society and religion, not to mention liberal and welcome doses of sarcastic good humor, offer far more than a mere precious curio.<br /><br />Charles Ryder, an officer in the British Army, finds himself suddenly stationed at a base located at the now-empty manor house of his long-lost friend, Sebastian Flyte, and his noble family. Being back at Brideshead, as this country seat is called, stirs Charles to remember what he had, what he lost, and what he carries with him.<br /><br />Waugh's ability with language and his keen insights into the human condition are on full display in this, his best-loved work, though it's atypically serious of intent for someone who is popularly thought of simply as a curmudgeonly, grandiloquent wit. For all his talent on display in other novels, you get a sense it came together here in a remarkable way. Waugh here paints a detailed and celebratory portrait of the good life, of picnicking on strawberries and white wine in secluded bowers, trysts on cruise ships, and life lived amid museum-caliber splendor, yet at the same time presents a compelling argument for Catholic austerity and discipline in seeking life's higher purpose.<br /><br />For Charles, it is a hard journey that takes him from being a young student at Oxford who believes with confidence \\"that to know and love one other human being is the root of all wisdom\\" to becoming a sadder, older man who begins to ponder: \\"Perhaps all our loves are merely hints and symbols; vagabond-language scrawled on gate-posts and paving-stones along the weary road that others have tramped before us.\\"<br /><br />Waugh writes with a fine sense of style and language, and cleverness, too, but in this book, unlike any of the others of his I have read, you get a feeling of sympathy, too, of people being observed not just with precision and wit but compassion, too, which is both unexpected and welcome. He promotes his faith unreservedly, but not uncritically, offering hard questions and a sense of grace as hard-won. Humor, too; like the stories one girl tells a credulous would-be convert about how Catholics all believe in \\"sacred monkeys\\" and sleep with their feet pointing East \\"because that's the direction to Heaven.\\"<br /><br />The occasional purpleness of the prose and some later dialogue is oft-commented upon, True, Waugh let himself go sometimes, but given the beauty of his writing, which is really about the best there is, its hard to begrudge the extra line, or the odd declamation that rings a bit false upon reflection. So much else here feels so alive. This is a book worth reading; savoring, too, though the reading's the only part you will have to work at.<br /><br />Whether or not you find the task of reading the novel daunting, worth checking out is David Cliffe's Evelyn Waugh website, which includes a detailed and illuminating \\"Brideshead\\" reading companion, and of course the excellent Grenada TV series from 1981, which is how I and so many others got here in the first place.

B0001A79JO|5.0|I didnt know who this band was until my husband talked me into listening to a punk sampler CD he got while in Iraq.  I loved them!  We listen to punk and rockabilly alot... and I like this band because they have a varied taste in music which obviously influenced them but also because they DO different things with their own music and dont just stick to the traditional sound of rockabilly and \\"psychobilly\\".  Theyre a breath of fresh air.  And it sure helps to have a front WOMAN not man.  Their new album comes out Sept 13, 2005 and I can hardly wait!
B0006IJ5PM|4.0|This was a surprisingly good film. It's subtle, and in a way it's not really about football. It's about the role of football in the lives of young men who don't have the oppurtunity for other moments of greatness in their lives. These Friday nights in their highschool years really are the best days of their life in a manner of speaking. It's their shot at immortality within their community. Afterwards, they take off the uniform and step into life as normal guys, lawyers and blue collar workers, single dads and car salesmen. I found this to be a surprisingly deep aspect of the film, one that I hadn't expected. I also think Billy Bob Thornton is great. He's one of few lead actors that knows how to be in a movie without hogging the lens. He's just a wonderful actor who knows how to be understated, when to step up front and when to blend back so that he brings out the best in other actors. Very good stuff.
B0002NRQTS|4.0|Presto, the album following 1987's Hold Your Fire, is a dramatic shift for Rush, back to a harder rock sound and almost (but not completely) abandoning the heavy synths of the 1980's.  While one of their weaker albums (with Hold Your Fire), this is still a damn good record.  The opening track, Show Don't Tell, is a blinder, up there with anything they've recorded.  Other awesome songs on here are the Pass (I saw them do this live in 2002 and 2004....amazing song), War Paint (GREAT lyrics and music....an underrated gem), Scars, and Superconductor.  The whole album is really good, but overral it just doesn't grab you the way, say, Moving Pictures or Grace Under Pressure do (just to name two).  Still, this is a VERY worthwhile Rush album and one you need to check out if you're  fan.  Just don't buy it first if you're starting to get into Rush.
B0006L16N8|5.0|To all you neysayers...\\"you don't understand music!\\"  This is truly a rare album, especially in this modern music era.  Captured in this unbelievable album is melody and rhythm that are sure to bring you goose bumps.  The genius lyrics that these four musicians apply to their music...makes you stop and wonder.  There is not a bad song on the album, every song, I guess you could say, has its own special something.  Bottom line...if you are pondering whether or not to buy this album, DO!!  They have passed any group or musical act out there today.  I promise, you will not be disapointed. ( I have purchased 3 albums...for home, car, and work...its that good ) <br /> <br />Ratings: <br /> <br />1  Square One - 5/5 <br />2  What If - 4.5/5 <br />3  White Shadows - 5/5 <br />4  Fix You - 4.5/5 <br />5  Talk - 5/5 <br />6  X&Y - 4.5/5 <br />7  Speed of Sound - 5/5 <br />8  A Message - 4/5 <br />9  Low - 5/5 <br />10 The Hardest Part - 5/5 <br />11 Swallowed In the Sea - 4.5/5 <br />12 Twisted Logic - 4.5/5 <br />13 'Til Kingdom Come - 4/5 <br /> <br />Overall - 4.66/5
B0000C0FJB|4.0|....the actual content and performance garners 5+ stars from me.  But the sound is pretty crappy.  Surprised they didn't master it better.  This is especially evident when you listen to the bonus tracks that were taken from another R30 tour show.  Both shows were soundboard sourced, but the bonus tracks sound WAY better.  That being said, this is a great, great set with amazing performances and a fantastic set list.  I won't go over it because if you went to any of the R30 shows, it's basically the same set.  All in all, a great live set (3 CDs of live Rush, how can you go wrong?) and it totally bucks the trend of 4 studio released and then a live one (coming only 2 albums after Test For Echo).
0385510454|4.0|Joel Backman is an enigma, imprisoned in solitary confinement. Who is this man? Is he being punished or protected? Does he have parents? Why should the president care about him? We are about to see a man placed in the cross hairs of a few corrupt men. So fasten your seat belt and get ready for a long flight. <br /> <br />Enter Teddy Maynard, the epitome of the power-hungry, psychopathic and physically crippled uberbureaucrat, head of the CIA, swathed in blankets. Even less likeable are the president, his chief advisor, and the president's son. What a very sorry lot. It is hard to believe that any such three officials could be in positions of elected or appointed power in America. They are petty, venal, unattractive, unsympathetic. And they are about to make Backman a whole lot sorrier - or so they think. They want to extract their own form of petty revenge on Backman for Joel's unproven sins, all under the guise of national security. <br /> <br />While Grisham readily admits to being outside his element in the spy and international intrigue genre, this book really reads much like \\"The Firm\\", with Bologna, Italy substituting for Memphis, and the CIA representing the legal mafia of Grishham's breakthrough book. As in \\"The Firm\\", what it will take is an imperfect, greedy, brilliant but nave lawyer to turn the tables on well-resource adversaries, taking the reader on a busman's holiday around northern Italy, whereas \\"The Firm\\" used the Caribbean. Backman is at first the victim of his own blindness and imbalanced life; only later does he show some signs of humanity and balance. <br /> <br />Despite some real credibility gaps and obvious oversights by the highly trained assassins, spies, and minders, Grisham still provides an enjoyable, fast-paced, if light read. The conclusion will leave many readers frustrated, annoyed and even angry. The loose ends tie together much too quickly and there are other loose ends lying about. So it's not great literature but, at a minimum,Grisham does a better job of capturing life, customs and style in northern Italy than do most of those touristy Tuscan guidebooks and novels. At least Backman makes a solid, concerted effort to learn Italian. And, of course, he is charmed by the beautiful, damaged, Italian, middle-aged Madonna. But let's not quibble. Just pick it up and read it at the beach, or on that next long-haul flight.
B000001ES9|4.0|...is an album filled up with straight ahead rock in the vein of their idols, Cream, Hendrix, Zeppelin, and the Who.  And while this album has some sub-par drumming by lame original drummer John Rutsey, it's still a hell of an enjoyable album and one I pull out to listen to quite often.  Geddy's voice is in prime condition, Alex is nuts on guitar and Geddy is great on bass. Rutsey's drumming is very simple and solid, but not spectacular.  The best songs on here are Finding My Way, Working Man, Here Again, Need Some Love, and In the Mood.  After the release of this album, right before their first tour of the USA, Rutsey quit the band due to his poor health (diabetes) and was replaced by Neil Peart and the rest is history.  These songs sounded WAY better on bootlegs from 1974-1975 and official live releases when Neil drummed on them live, but this is still a fun and good album.  I just wouldn't buy it first if you're just getting into Rush.
0060920084|2.0|Fortunately this is not the first book from Bill Bryson I ever read or I would have given up.  It is very insulting to Americans, especially small town people.  Although his humor is at times funny it's also offensive (to me anyway).  Even though he was born American, he was living in the UK and flew over to write this book.  He portrays the heart of our nation as a bunch of idiots basically.  Skip this one and get \\"In a Sunburned Country\\" instead.
B0002NRQTI|5.0|Counterparts is one of Rush's best albums, almost up there with the stuff from their classic period.  It's just an extremely well-written, well-recorded and awesomely-performed record from start to finish.  The opening duo of Animate and Stick It Out are fantastic and two of Rush's finest moments.  Just amazing songs, Animate being a relentless and wrenching song with great lyrics and Stick It Out just kicking you in the gut it's so heavy.  Other great cuts on here are the touching Nobody's Hero, the gritty Between Sun and Moon, and one of Rush's coolest instrumentals, Leave That Thing Alone.  I also really like Double Agent and Cold Fire.  All in all, a great album and the best Rush album of the 1990's era.
0767903862|5.0|This book is both funny and interesting.  I've never been to Australia but now I feel I have due to this fantastic book.  Bryson keeps you laughing and you don't even notice you're getting a culture lesson as well.
B00005JNPZ|4.0|I was surprised to find that I liked 95% of this movie. I was expecting some typical bubbling and embarassing moments that you normally want to fast forward through. What you get is a good structured film with some very funny moments.  The scene when Albert gets back to his office after quitting his job is extremely funny.      However, the ending between Hitch and Sara Melas was poor. Sara had practially destroyed Hitch's career without any warning or comment.. and yet it is Hitch who is begging and babbling a long pathetic speech to try and win Sara back into his life.  Five minutes of film ruined the end.      I would still recommend the movie as there are some very funny moments..  que Albert dancing..
0609610570|2.0|One of the most intriguing elements of this book was the basic concept. Is execution really a major element in corporate success or failure? Why Smart Executives Fail suggests that it is not, arguing that execution expertise can be quickly purchased (p 5). One answer to this difference of opinion may be the nature of the businesses studied. Why Smart Executives Fail studied instances in which successful companies failed, while Bossidy and Charan tell us that good execution must occur to achieve any success. In other words, most or all of the companies studied in Why Smart Executives Fail probably had a record of successful execution prior to their collapse. Johnson & Johnson's stent business is a prime example of these divergent viewpoints, and Finklestein wins this argument through his (apparently) more wide-ranging and in-depth research. Despite this, many of the recommendations in the two books are very similar, for example, Bossidy and Charan say, \\"Insist on realism,\\" (p 57) and Finklestein gives \\"They ruthlessly eliminate anyone who isn't 100 percent behind them\\" as Bad Habit #4 (p 226).    Bossidy and Charan present their ideas well, and give a good theoretical framework for successful execution. Their advice on how to integrate the people process with strategy and operations is particularly valuable, and they follow their own advice by breaking down their theory into operable steps. Their evidence in support of execution as a competitive advantage is thin, however, resting largely on personal experience. Other examples are much weakened by anonymity. In the end, Bossidy and Charan are not convincing in their argument that \\"Most often today the difference between a company and its competitor is the ability to execute.\\" (p 5) While a fundamental level of execution is clearly necessary for success, in most cases it is not sufficient; other elements of strategy play a large role.
6304696566|5.0|This is an amazing movie. Certainly it is one of John Wayne's best. I agree with another reviewer that the scene where he tells of Lucy's death is very well done. It ranks right up there with the scene when he quotes a poem at the funeral for some of his men in \\"They Were Expendable.\\" He was definitely one of the greatest actors of all time. I may be far-fetched, but does anyone else share my hypothesis that Martin is Ethan's son? This is a very fascinating movie!
B00003CX5P|2.0|Actually, I thought this movie was ok to pretty good when I saw it in the theatre. However, upon repeat viewings I liked it less and less. I had read on a Star Wars fan site that I would like Phantom Menace more after seeing Revenge of the Sith. Supposedly, Revenge would bring out all the \\"subtleties\\" of Phantom. But this did not happen. If anything, I like Phantom less after watching Revenge. For starters, the CGI character Jar Jar Binks is really an irrelevant character. All he does is provide silly slapstick humor and show-off Lucas's new digital toys, which wouldn't be so bad if the character had a purpose. But, we never see this purpose. He's supposed to lead our heroes through the planet core on Naboo, but we never see him provide this info. He goes from outcast to a general in the Gungan army, but does nothing to merit this promotion (though in Jar Jar's defense, the leader of the Gungans' is a pretty asinine character as well). He bumbles through a battle (which unfortunately interrupts an awesome lightsabre duel). And although he has a so-called pivotal scene in Attack of the Clones, nearly any other character could have served this purpose without hurting the movie.  Secondly, the directing is terrible. In multiple scenes it appears that Jake Lloyd (Anakin) is merely reading his lines off cue cards. Surely, Lucas could have gotten better takes of some of these scenes. Third, Obi Wan Kenobi's force powers are inconsistent: At the beginning of the movie he and Qui Gon use force \\"speed\\" to escape super battle droids, but when it comes time to help Qui Gon fight Darth Maul, Obi Wan runs at normal speed (which conveniently allows Maul and Qui Gon to fight one on one to a stunning end). Finally, this movie just doesn't seem to set up the next two movies very well. Because Anakin's just a young boy, we can't really discern his infatuation with Padme (Luke and Leia's mother). So, when we see these characters in Attack of the Clones, Anakin's obsession with Padme makes him look like a stalker. Moreover, Padme goes from being obviously uncomfortable with Anakin's stalker glares to playing tonsil hockey with him a few scenes later. Way too rushed - and I blame this on Phantom for not developing a relationship between these characters. Overall, I think Phantom is just a wasted opportunity for the Star Wars saga. I recommend this movie only if you are a die hard Star Wars fan.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am also one of the poor saps who didn't hear about Firefly until the DVD came out.  I watched the entire series with loving obsession.  It wasn't until after I found out it had been cancelled...<br /><br />NNNnNnooooooooooo!!!!!!<br /><br />I am not a tv junkie.  I do not ritualistically plan my schedule around tv shows, BUT I WAS GONNA!!!  I recently heard the movie is to be released and I am praying with every fibre that it brings back the series.  Buy the DVD!  Show your support!  Firefly--Keep It Flying!!!
0446678430|2.0|This book is very interesting and teaches a lot of common senses. Unfortunately - like most other books of the Rich Dad series - Robert repeats his messages over and over after 'Rich Dad Poor Dad' without  adding extra value in the new books. His message is: be your own boss and that can be found in his first book. Another weak point is all his books tell you the 'why' but not the 'how to'. My advice: read only the first book in the serie.
B000084T18|2.0|Dr Dre is delighted, fans are joyous, and Curtis Jackson`s ego is beginning to expand.  But as 50cent continues to captivate universal Hip-Hop audiences, I am finding it rather difficult to control my frustration!  It is always cheering when a real raconteur stampedes the stage, but once again, I am left wondering what is it exactly that has evoked the mournful revolution in Rap.  The \\"Next 2Pac\\", has just began performing his implement, releasing a platinum album and to create the biggest buzz in the world of Hip-Hop.  But unfortunately, the enigmatic withdrawal of intelligent lyrics on POOR LIL RICH is just a brief exemplification of every other track on the album.  The litany of references to violence becomes tedious, (WHAT UP GANGSTER), (IF I CANT), (BLOOD HOUND), and (DONT PUSH ME).  In those final hours of uncertainty, (WISH DEATH), once again fails to duplicate the prophetic style of so many others in the past.  As his devouring passion for weaponry becomes the leitmotif in this LP, the obsession has led Rap music into the most self-destructive calamity ever known!  And those dispatched to the world of meaningful lyrics outpost will not enjoy the radio-friendly hits (IN DA CLUB) and (P.I.M.P.).  If only 50Cent wrote his lyrics as ambitiously as he strives to appear on television adverts!  Instead of a more pragmatic approach to solve his problems, it seems 50cent believes a combatitave one is the answer, (BACK DOWN).  Buy this album if you are entertained by incessant bragging and meaningless lyrics, but otherwise do you utmost best to avoid!  Sometimes it makes you believe Rap music can not get any worse than this, (until you hear Will Smith)!
B0006L16N8|2.0|Man, I get a kick out of you guys. Coldplay plays it safe, puts out a cookie cutter, formulated album (previously called \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\"), and everyone eats it up. One comment by another reviewer sums it all up, and I quote: \\"I think the single 'Speed of Sound' was brilliant, although when I first heard the soaring sounds of speed of sound I thought it was Clocks.\\" -- that's coming from someone who gave this album 5 stars. Now please tell me, if a new song resembles one of their past songs THAT much (and it does), how in the world can you justify a 5 star review?? <br /> <br />I do have to hand it to 'em. They've found the right formula for commercial success. Now they can milk it for all it's worth. For a musician, that's like striking oil, and who can blame them for selling out? Oh yeah...I can. Parachutes was an impressive album. They actually sounded alive and interested in what they were doing. Now, especially with X&Y, they sound tired, dazed, uninspired, unchallenged, and frankly, downright bored. <br /> <br />Others have been angered by Radiohead comparisons. Well, did they ever think that maybe there are so many because there's some sort of resemblence? It's not some cosmic coincidence that everyone and their dog sees the similarities - the vocal style (not just the falsetto, his phrasing and style, too), the song structures, the instrumentation (thinking the use of their piano, among other things). The only thing is this: Radiohead has guts and puts out whatever music they feel like like making at the time. That's why every one of their albums sounds inspired and fresh. OK Computer, Kid A, and Amnesiac were all absolutely brilliant albums. It's a darn good thing Thom Yorke & co. paid no attention to what the majority of the population would have bought en mass. However, Chris Martin & friends have chosen a different path. After putting out a heartfelt and genuinly good debut album, have turned to churning out elevator quality muzak. It's likethey went on auto-pilot and let it ride. But, they're selling big. More power to them. Go ahead and buy the CD if you like this kind of stuff. Oh yeah, I think this is where you his the \\"not helpful\\" button (which, by the way, isn't the same thing as the \\"I don't agree\\" button). <br />
B00005T7I1|4.0|The script lives up to its subject, a cartoon strip, but fans of the old Dick Tracy won't be disappointed. Our old favorite characters are all there and the soundtrack, especially Madonna's sexy \\"Sooner or Later\\" is fabulous. The production values are great, with a definite comic book feel and appearance, and even if we didn't get all these great items to enjoy, there's the cameo and casting with some of Hollywood's brightest stars. Definitely worth adding to your DVD collection
B00000099Y|5.0|That seems to be Maynard Keenan's prescription on Aenima, Tool's second full-length album.  Of course, on the title track, Keenan directs his ire toward Los Angeles in particular; but this city is obvioulsy being used as a microcosm of American society.  L.A. is merely the most visible symbol of the prevailing culture of consumerism that is cheapening and degrading every aspect of western society.  If I might be so presumptuous as to take a stab at the driving idea behind the lyrical content of this record, and Tool's latest, Lateralus, (although it is dealt with less fatalistically on the latter)  I would say it goes something like this: People are losing touch with their own identities and with reality in general.  Our culture is full of s#!t.   <br /> <br />That is, of course, just my analysis.  If it is correct, I could not agree more with Maynard James Keenan. <br /> <br />The compositions on Aenima are more patient than those on Undertow.  The second track, Eulogy, begins with a beautifully constructed prelude that introduces all of the unifying themes of the piece.  The listener must also be patient, but with patience comes more substantial satisfaction.  This record is angry and intense, thoughtful and indignant.  So shut up and BUY!
6304779607|1.0|Stallone plays a rogue cop on the trail of a serial killer, which could have presented us with a gripping adventure, but too much is left unclear. The villains seem to belong to some sort of neo-nazi or white supremacy group, but their motivations are never explored. Why are they killing people? What do they expect to gain? Why aren't they making demands of the cops? The whole movie is just an excuse for Stallone to rack up the body count. Terribly disappointing since Sly IS a good actor and can do so much better. Rent the Rambo or Rocky series instead
B0007Y08I8|5.0|Team America lampoons the whole action movie genra (Idependense Day, Black Hawk Down, Peal Hardor etc...)  as well as the \\"F@&# Yeah!\\" attitude of the US Military. The whole idea that it is done with puppets makes it that much more funny and twisted. You definitley need a twisted sense of humor to enjoy this movie, and I did. Some parts were so funny I nearly cried! Also, do yourself a favor and get the unrated version.
B00005JNJT|5.0|It's about time that we get the \\"dark knight\\" that we have been waiting for him to return. I just saw this movie this last weekend, and it left me feeling the same as the first Batman movie that I saw with Michael Keaton. It was dark, and you could feel how the city was going down hill. I was really surprised after the attempts to make these movies with the comic feel that they went back to the dark script and sets.<br /><br />Christian Bale was a great Batman; he was dark, upset about his parents. It was a great balance. I also really enjoyed the relationships that you were able to understand more: Bruce & his Parents, Rachel (Could have done without), Alfred, and Lut. Gordon. It was create to know the story and watch as they set them selves us for what we all know is coming.<br /><br />I really suggest that if you loved Batman & Batman Returns than you will LOVE this one too. I would make sure that you see it in the theatre before it's off the big screen.
B00097A5I6|4.0|\\"truth\\"is this album is much better than i would have expected. From the start of \\"turn up the sun\\" which starts soft then comes in with the swagger guitar attack- oasis sound like they atleast believe in themselves again. New influences pop up as well- the kinks-stones-early who and small faces- very sixties arrangments and production.\\"lyla\\" is a strong single but the real gem is \\"part of the Que\\"- a noel penned ode to urban isolation. Also i like hard driving raw acoustic guitars that appear on most of the songs-love like a bomb uses this to full effect. Of note some reviewers have said that the best songs were penned by the nongallagher members. But the tunes by gem and bell while not bad at all are not at the level of liams and noels-especially noels. \\"truth\\" sounds vibrant and optimistic- both rarities in todays glum cynicist musical world. On the flip side- oasis still suffer from being recorded too \\"trebly\\" very bright and lacking bottom end. And the lyrics are pretty pedestrian. \\"let there be love\\" though well written has some trite lyrics- its the music that makes the song shine. And dont worry= at times they get the beatles vibe just right! All in ALL a keeper that will still sound good 10 years from now despite sounding like it was recorded in 1965- just like the fab four the who and others still do!
B000002UJQ|5.0|I remember occasionally glancing at this very page years ago in wonder - OK Computer by Radiohead, the critically acclaimed record of 1997.  Though I read tens, perhaps hundreds of reviews, something held me back from ordering the CD. I'm not sure what that was, maybe the many mixed reviews of how the disc was \\"hard to get into\\" or simply \\"boring\\", but finally, this year, I had the nerve to make the purchase. Upon listening to the CD, I was already disagreeing with many reviews here: The album was amazing. And though it remains one of the most grippingly unique, intelligent, epic yet eccentric records ever made, it only took one listen for me to adore nearly every track on the album. <br /> <br />Here are separate reviews for each song, track by track: <br /> <br />#1: Airbag:  An epic opener. Telling the story of a car crash survivor, this song tempts to portray the feeling of a second chance; a near fatality. Starting with a stellar opening riff, leading to an incredibly catchy chorus, and ending with a climatic edning instrumental, this song is a part of the album. 9/10 <br /> <br />#2: Paranoid Android:  Although it's the album's first single, Paranoid Android is not the most conventional song on the album, rather it is one of the finest, most complex tracks on OK Computer. At more than six minutes, one would expect such a long song to drag on, but this is not the case: The song varies tempoes and styles, contains many riveting instrumentals and guitar soloes, and continues to showcase Thom Yorke's incredible vocal range and songwriting skills. 10/10 <br /> <br />#3: Subterranean Homesick Alien:  The title \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien\\" may seem to herald to an edgy alternative song, but in reality, SHA is actually a very laid-back brit-rock, almost jazzy song. The verses consist of soft, dreamy electric guitar while Yorke sings careful, thoughtful lyrics. The chorus is the most brit-rock part of this whole album, with  many harmonizing sections of keyboard, guitar, and vocals coming together to create a soothing melody. Though it's very unlike anything else on the album, Subterranean Homesick Alien is probably the best slow song on OK Computer. 9/10 <br /> <br />#4: Exit Music(For a Film):  As the title suggests, this song was written for a full-length feature film, namely the new remake of Romeo and Juliet. Written for after the film's tragic downfall, the beginning of the song is home to mesmerizing vocals by Thom over soft guitar, crowd sampling and background vocals. As the song progresses, we are ezposed to fuzzy keyboards and harder drums,eventually leading up to the song's almost overly climatic ending. The ending line \\"We hope that you choke, that you choke\\" is almost over-dramatic. Nevertheless, this is a great song. 9/10 <br /> <br />#5: Let Down:  Let Down is considered by many fans to be the best song on OK Computer. IN this song, Thom conveys feelings of desperation, comparing it to being \\"Crushed like a bug in the ground\\", begging, \\"don't get sentimental\\", as \\"It always ends up drivel\\". The chorus features incredibly beautiful harmonies of vocals, guitars and keyboards, accompanied by perfectly placed drumming. This song is possibly OK Computer's best track; a must-hear. 10/10 <br /> <br />#6: Karma Police:  The second single off OK Computer, Karma Police is probably one of the most mainstream-sounding songs off the album, sounding like typical U2 piano-based rock. But Radiohead takes it to another level: With the unforgettable pre-chorus whisper of \\"This is what you get when you mess with us\\", Karma Police becomes a definite winner. THe song ends with Yorke crooning, \\"for a minute there, I lost myself\\" over almost-perfect background vocal harmonies. 9/10 <br /> <br />#7: Fitter Happier:  This song is quite an oddity. Merely just a computerized voice muttering ideals and realities of American Culture, this song is an easy skip on first sight. But upon further listens, the neautralized voice seems more emotional than a real one. Accompanied by background piano and voice sampling, this song, to many, divides the album into halves. This song is strange, and therefore I wield it no rating. <br /> <br />#8: Electioneering: This track is a hit-or-miss. It is named both the only rock and true political song on OKC. Relying on a triplet beat and on blues-esque riffs, this song is truly much different than any other song on the record, but not neccessarily in the best way. Though some fans regard this as a nearly \\"perfect\\" song, many feel this as the album's true weak spot. I tend to go with the second opinion. Though it goes with all the rules of the other songs on the album, it doesn't work this time for me. 5/10 <br /> <br />#9: Climbing up the Walls:  CutW has been named one of Radiohead's only true scary songs, and for good reason. The song features many carefully prepared samples and keyboards, and uses a distorted version of Thom's voice to execute a beautiful achievement. The origin of this song is equally enthralling. With lyrics such as \\"Do not cry out or hit the alarm, you know we're friends till we die\\" and \\"So lock the kids up safe tonight, shut the eyes in the cupboard\\", this song is theorized to be about everyday fears coming true, as well as panic buttons and lethally insane intruders. This song's instrumental is the best on the album, with a haunting violin section combined with trashing keyboards and epic lead guitar. The song ends with a haunting scream by Yorke himself, followed only by cryptic noises and beeps. This song is, in my opinion, both the hardest song to get into and the best on the album. 10/10 <br /> <br />#10: No Surprises:  To begin, this song is perfectly placed right after Climbing up the Walls, because of the large contrast: while CupW is a morbid, scary song, No Surprises is a seemingly happy and melodic feel-good song. It was also the third single off the album. Though it only contains soft drumming and guitar with other backup instruments, this isn't a tedious song to listen to. The lyrics provide a story of a man who feels trapped by life, or as some believe, takes his own life. Nevertheless, it's entertaining to listen to.  9/10 <br /> <br />#11: Lucky:  I have to admit that this is only song I'm bored with on the entire album. Some compare this song to Airbag, but I believe it to be more like Subterranean Homesick Alien: Lucky contains soft guitar and thoughtful lyrics in the verses with a louder, more epic chorus. I don't know why, but to me, this song is just too typical. 7/10 <br /> <br />#12: The Tourist:  Though I can't say I hoped the album would end in an anticlimatic way, I definitely can say this was the best way to do so. Written in 3/4, this song is kind of similar to SHA also, but with more emotion. It also fits the mood, more so than Lucky. Yorke's lyrics may not act accordingly, but they are executed superbly. A great ending track. 9/10 <br /> <br />Overall, because most tracks I felt were 9/10 and above, OK Computer gets a 5/5 from me. This is one of the best CD purchases I have made in well over a year, and I hope this review helped make your decision. And anyway, if you're still reading this, go ahead and purchase this album. Just do it! I know I should've ages ago; if you're thinking this hard about it, just do so.
B0006L16N8|5.0|X&Y is a brilliant album! Coldplay has been such a consistent band making amazing albums since \\"Parachutes\\", their albums just keep getting better and better. There is not a single song in X&Y that disappoints, every song is good in it's own way. The songs have become more melodic and anthemic, the songwriting is amazing with beautiful lyrics and Chris Martin's voice goes so well with the songs, in my opinion his voice has never sounded better. So now, does Coldplay have the ability to \\"take out U2\\"? I think so.
B0007VZ9DK|5.0|It is definitely the best mob movie ever made. It shows you how everything in the mob works.  <br />Despite its length, you don't get bored, believe me.  <br />It's another succesful collaboration between Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese. Let me tell you that it's the third part of the trilogy about mob that Scorsese and De Niro had made. The first one is Mean Streets, which is the fist movie made by these great people. Then it's the amazing Goodfellas. So Casino closes this trilogy , and it is the best of all three.  <br />Both, De Niro and Pesci, talk throughout the movie of what is all about in mob. <br />The acting of De Niro is great, as usual, and also Pesci is wonderful as Ace's maniac friend.  <br />I especially loved the ending where the big hotels rise up. Also the beginning is great, when Ace is blown up in his car and begins to fly in the screen while the credits are being  <br />showed.  <br />James Woods is great as Ginger's lover. <br />It's full of violence like all mob movies, but is quite different from all of them, because it shows you that no matter if you're at the top and you're bad, you're going to fall down. It's so evident in the movie, because they had it all, everything was perfect, but a little mistake made them fell with no possibility of coming back. <br />I loved the outfit of De Niro, it's all shiny silk, and colorful suits. <br />Scorsese once again shows us why he is the best director. <br />In this new edition, there's a lot of footage, which is wonderful.  <br />I highly recommend you this excellent movie. So if you haven't seen it, SEE IT!
0689865384|5.0|I have read so many books in my life and I have never read a book where I got so into it. Uglies was amazing and I absolutly loved it. After reading it I now can't even wait till the other two books come out. Pretties is going to be awsome I can just tell.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|best movie to hit dvd in a while   its so stupid its funny  go get it and VOTE FOR PEDRO-- and all of your wildest dreams will come true..... <br />
B00005JNEW|2.0|Watching this movie, I felt like I was watching a documentary of a High School football team rather than a Football movie.  I was very dissappointed because of all the hype around it when it first came out.  The only story I enjoyed was the kid who couldn't hold on to the ball and his alcoholic father, now that was movie making.  If you love football, this is probably a movie for you to watch.  If you are like me and just want to watch a good movie and are so so about football, I don't recommend this movie
B00005JNJT|5.0|I have not been so wowed by a movie in decades! Just about everything was right --  plot, script, dialog, tone, characters, acting, special effects, you name it. Christian Bale was completely convincing as a young man struggling with the inner demons acquired when his parents were gunned down by a thug. He was perfectly played Bruce Wayne's cover story as a spoiled and shallow boy billionaire. Gary Oldman's Jim Gordon of the Gotham PD was also spot on -- making Gordon a believable and sympathetic figure as opposed to the buffoonish one we might have expected. Even Michael Caine, as Alfred, pulled more out of himself as an actor than in his last 5 films.<br /><br />\\"Batman Begins\\" gives us a new take on the genesis of the Caped Crusader -- from Bruce Wayne's childhood (when after a well into a well, he was attacked by frightened bats), to \\"the missing years\\" when he salved the guilt and rage over his parents' murders by hanging with criminals, to his return to Gotham, his discovery of the Batcave, and the development of his costume and Batmobile (thankfully never called such in the movie). It was genius not to lay the development of Wayne's martial arts skills AND incredible gizmo invention on one man. Morgan Freeman, as science guru Lucius Fox handled that task flawlessly. And the scriptwriters came up with some truly frightening bad guys whose evil plot (a weapon of mass psychosis) was truly inspired and frightening. Gotham -- a twisted take on NYC -- never looked so seedy, corrupt or hopeless.<br /><br />This was an incredibly well-crafted movie -- with special effects always in the service of the story. The scriptwriters tied up every loose know and left no details hanging. The plot spun around like a cave full of bats, turning back onto itself in delicious spirals. An incredible achievement!
B0002858YS|5.0|I love this band! I first heard of them from \\"The OC\\". Their best tracks on this album are \\"Smile Like You Mean It\\" and \\"Jenny Was a Friend of Mine,\\" which happens to be the band's favorite track. \\"Jenny\\" and \\"Midnight Show\\" are two components to a three part murder story. This is definitely a must-have album.
B00005MM01|5.0|Originally a 2-LP set in a box, this album captures Donovan in his late60's psychedelic flower child persona. Half of it was released as a seperate album \\"Wear Your Love Like Heaven\\" now also available with \\"Mellow Yellow\\" as a double-album CD.The other half was released as \\"For Little Ones\\", now apparently not available as a seperate album, and only available on this CD. The \\"Wear Your Love\\" half is more pop and the \\"For Little Ones\\" half is gentle flower-child folk music, delicate little melodies. If you want a shot of pure sixties love&peace culture, this is one of Donovan's best and a beautiful relic perfectly capturing a moment of that era.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I had never heard nor did I own a System of a Down CD. I was drawn to this CD not by the first single \\"B.Y.O.B\\" but by the fact that it was impacting the sales charts with such assertiveness.  When I first heard \\"B.Y.O.B.\\", I thought it was  bit too out there for my tastes and I couldn't understand how the album debuted on the top of the charts.  Because I kept seeing the 6 figures it was producing on the charts, I thought that maybe I would just buy it to see if it was deserving of the hype of which it was receiving.  Believe me, it was worth every cent of the $15.85 I spent on it.  Excellent, Excellent disc.<br /><br />This disc impressed me so much that I listened to it several times. What truly impressed me was the fact that instead of just playing traditional metal with all the angst and the tension, System of A Down makes it interesting by adding incredibly unexpected tempo changes and style changes within EVERY song. You felt like you were riding the best rollercoaster you have ever ridden with a million curves and turns.  This is a consistent listen that will definitely not only keep the avid metal fan listening, but will keep those who aren't particularly metal listeners enthralled.<br /><br />My favorite tracks are: \\"B.Y.O.B\\" (which I grew to love), \\"Revenga\\", \\"Cigaro\\", \\"Radio/Video\\", and \\"Violent Pornography\\".  I can't wait till HYPNOTIZE comes out later this fall.  I will be the first one to buy it.  I highly recommend MEZMERIZE.  5 stars!
0634022296|3.0|I've been playing beatles tunes since 91 and I have tons of chords books of the beatles. This is not an accurate chord book. One of the good things about the Beatles is that they played beautiful songs with very \\"simple\\" chords. And you find here chords like F minor 7 suspended 4 plus A1 and so on. By the price you get a lot but if you can find another book much simpler than this, buy it.
B00006AG5N|1.0|I can't believe how people is so stupid and eager to call this music.Elvis is one of the worst singers i've ever heard.He can't sing for rat's s***.His music is even worse.Elvis is a joke artist
B0002B55WA|3.0|We all know that this movie was the only bad thing the beatles did. But, why bad? This was supposed to be a hippie or a very weird movie. It was on purpose. The music is like all the beatles music, very good. I am the warlus is like pop art and your mother should know, well, when in life you will see the greatest band of the moment ever dancing in a silly way? But you saw it here. 3 stars because of the superb bad quality of this dvd.
B00097DX3U|4.0|Some of the reviews on Amazon make me cringe, not even laugh! I fully realise everyone is entitled to an opinion but some should refrain if they're idiots! I know this will sound condescending but as a guitarist, songwriter and appreciater of rock history i'm going to give an informed opinion ;-) ... <br /> <br />While not quite as fresh as the first album this is still an excellent album and far superior to most (if not all) new material out there. Cornell is one of the unsung heroes of rock and, in my humble opinion, quite frankly a genius... amazing voice and stunning songwriter. Not being familiar with RATM I can't give a balanced comparison of this against previous RATM material, just a current assessment. <br /> <br />Morello's doing a little less of the silly sound-effect solos compared to the the first outing and a bit more exceptional guitar work, which he is obviously capable of. The band is tight with some lovely snare sounds to boot! This album is maybe a little less 'heavy' than the first with 'dandelion' sounding like it could be off Cornell's stunning solo album 'Euphoria Morning'. <br /> <br />Cornell's vocal on 'heavens dead' sends shivers up my spine, how he can sound so raw and powerful one minute and so sweet the next is testament to his gift. <br /> <br />I won't go into any more detail - if you have any concept of talent and love rock then get this album, you will not be disappointed. It's tempting to give 5 stars... but in relation to the rest of rockdom this is not a bad effort at all. <br /> <br />Related recommended listening - Soundgarden, Temple Of The Dog.
B00005JKG7|5.0|This film is a hell of a good ride. Great visuals, soundtrack outstanding, and Jamie Lee in all her glory. A good old fashioned ghost story. The use of widescreen is mesmerising and visually, a well shot and beautiful film. Can't name another horror film that uses so much light or daytime, and is still downright spooky. Not a huge hit in 1980 but found a strong core of fans through video. Currently remaking it, why, no idea, no one is original anymore. Pick this up, make the popcorn, turn the lights down, and enjoy some good suspense. Every date I have had, cling to me so hard, worth it for that. Serious, a hell of a good film, without the gore and nudity which many horror films feel they need. Carpenter's soundtrack is outstanding, melodic and piercing. 5.1 this dvd, turn it up, you will jump, guaranteed. Enjoy this John Carpenter classic. Sympathy to Debra Hill, co-author, producer, who passed away early this year. She and her talents will sorely be missed. A little trivia, Blake, the lead ghost is played by Rob Bottin, the fx wiz of the film. No cgi in these days, the fog was actually dry ice or fog machines. Tough to direct that, when it wants to do its own thing. John Carpenter's cameo,(ala Hitchcock), Bennett at the beginning asking Father Malone to be paid. The little boy, Andy, is in Halloween II, with the razorblade in the mouth, ouch.
B000000WZ4|5.0|...I feel that this is the best Depeche Mode album to date. The first time I heard \\"Home\\" on the radio, I was glad I was at a stop light, for I cried at the raw beauty and emotion of the song. I had never cried to a song before. I went directly to the nearest music store and plunked down the $20 for the CD without hearing any other track (which is unheard of for me since my rule is I must know at least three songs before I will buy a CD). I listened to the whole thing on the way home, going the long way so I could heard the whole thing unbroken. The entire album is a lush work of perfection by Gahan and Co. The lyrics really touched a spot inside me since I, at the time, was going through a very rough patch in my life.  <br /> <br />I must say that \\"Home\\" remains my favorite work on the entire album, but \\"Sister of Night\\" is a very close second. \\"Barrel of a Gun\\" is like someone reached inside my mind and wrote down exactly what I wanted to say to the person that was hurting me at the time. \\"Freestate\\" urged me to just let go of my pain and hurt, assuring me that someone out there had felt what I was feeling (Martin had to write the lyrics, and if not from experience, then what??). \\"Insight\\" could have been written by me.  <br /> <br />Years later, \\"Home\\" would be the first song I danced to with my new husband at our wedding. No one really understood why we had not chosen a \\"typical\\" love song, but the lyrics were deeply pesonal to me and my husband (he is a DM fan as well, and his feelings mirror mine about this album).  <br /> <br />In short, \\"Ultra\\" has yet to be topped on my list of favorite albums, and let's just say that I am not really looking too hard for a replacement. I get a lump in my throat from the first note to the last, but that's a good thing, I promise.
0767834739|2.0|The first Resident Evil movie was a homage to zombie movies that have gone before.  And Aliens.  And a few other movies thrown in for good measure.  It had a creepy girl, zombies, long-tongued monsters, carnivorous dogs, and Alice (Milla Jovovich) with lots of firepower.<br /><br />Resident Evil: Apocalypse has all of those things, but none of the spunk.  Where the first movie had a relentless ambiance of terror, Apocalypse is a juiced up action horror without much horror.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: This review contains spoilers, but that's sort of like saying \\"water might be wet\\"--everything I explain here is painfully obvious from the start of the film.  So read at your own risk, but you're not risking much...<br /><br />Where we last left Alice, she and the other survivor of the movie, Matt Addison (Eric Mabius), were captured by the evil Umbrella Corporation for experimentation.  When she awoke, nobody was left alive in the hospital (shades of 28 Days Later).  So Alice does what she always does in an uncertain situation...she grabs a shotgun.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the entire city has been infected with the T-virus, a biological weapon that 1) mutates Alice into a superhuman killing machine, 2) turns poor Matt into Nemesis, a muscle-bound gun-toting juggernaut, 3) turns people into zombies, 4) turns dogs into zombies, 5) allows a little girl (Angie Ashford, played by Sophie Vavasseur) to walk, 6) did I mention it turns people into zombies?<br /><br />So what does Umbrella do?  What all authorities do in a zombie movie: they seal off Raccoon City and call in the nukes (shades of Return of the Living Dead).<br /><br />Also running about trapped in the city is a cast of stereotypes: the hot police chick (Jill Valentine, played by Sienna Guillory who fails miserably at disguising her British accent), the hot military dude (Carlos Olivera, played by Oded Fehr), and the funny black guy who swears a lot (L.J., played by Mike Epps).  After lots of grandstanding, swearing, amazingly accurate zombie head shots, and a lot of confusion, the plot finally gets going when Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris) gives them a mission.<br /><br />Using his amazing \\"personnel locator\\" that only seems to work for Dr. Ashford, he discovers that Angie is holed up in her school, all by herself.  We're not sure exactly how this is possible, but never you mind...what matters is Ashford hacks into the entire Raccoon City network and is able to view what's going on from every video camera and microphone.  He then calls our heroes with a deal: if they agree to get his little girl out of the city, he will tell them how to escape.<br /><br />The means of escape is through a helicopter.  That's it.  That's the big plan.  Hijack a helicopter.  But of course, it's all a trap, and ultimately Alice and Nemesis must duke it out...for some reason.  Something about the perfect weapon, yadda yadda.<br /><br />There are a lot of neat graphical touches throughout the film.  Alice's bullets have little Umbrella Corp. icons on them.  The helicopters are painted with the Umbrella Corp. logo.  And the end of the film (and subsequent cover-up of the nuclear blast) is entertaining in the same way that the rise of a zombie outbreak was entertaining in Shaun of the Dead.  Which is to say it's awful, but you enjoy it anyway.<br /><br />But that's it.  Alice is far too much of a superhero to make us feel concerned about her survival.  There are too many characters to keep track of without enough plot development to care about them (Carlos seems to have no actual value at all, less so than even L.J.'s offensive portrayal as a black gangsta). And for some reason, Alice's every move is punctuated by a whiplash sound that quickly gets tiresome.<br /><br />There's a lot of slow motion action sequences, a lot of blue lensing, and a lot of freeze-frame shots of weapons dropping to the ground. The director (Alexander Witt) is new to directing a film on his own.  He doesn't seem to know what to dowith Paul W.S. Anderson's script, and it shows.<br /><br />The movie drags on and on and on long after it should end, such that it feels a lot like you're watching the third film (an inevitability).  By that time I had lost interest.  When the most interesting part of a film is Jill Valentine's miniskirt, it's hard to care about Alice's fate.n't seem to know what to do with Paul W.S.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|What else is there to say? Weber has done it again.  I must admit I have watched this movie at least 20 times since the DVD came out and saw it 3 times at the theater.  This was a wonderful version of this timeless love triangle.  I loved the way they used younger actors and actresses to really grab your heart.  And that kiss, oh my god, who could ever not agree that the kiss between the phantom and Christine at the end was not the most powerful and emotional kiss you've ever seen?  Anyway, if you don't buy this DVD or at least rent it you are definitly missing out!
B00006RAKP|5.0|Is it possible for me to express how much has Elton John's music influenced my life? I don't think so. I've been exposed to his music since childhood 'cause my mother was a big fan of his so I knew all his songs by the time I was 10. Highlights on the album include \\"Your Song', 'Daniel', 'Goodbye Yellow Brickroad', 'I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues' and 'Sacrifice\\".
B0009A1AS2|5.0|This cd is great!! The more I listen to it the greater it gets. If you are a Dream Theater fan I gotta believe your gonna love this one. If your a fan of Dream Theater's \\"Images and Words\\" your gonna love \\"Octavarium\\". I can only imagine what's next.
B000065V3H|4.0|It's been a while since I've seen it but i do remeber that it's an very cute 80's movie. And it really made me happy that I knew what school they filmed it at YEH GO THS!
B00004Y6NW|5.0|Their debut is an amazing album. Mark Knopfler is one of the best guitar players and should be up their with Clapton. A very bluesy album with some great rock songs on it. Sultans of Swing, Down to the Waterline, Water of Love, Six Blade Knife, Southbound Again, and Wild West End are my favorites. Must have this in any collection.
B00005NTJK|5.0|This is probably my favorite Jethro Tull effort. The quality musicanship on \\"Benefit\\" is obvious but what really hits me when I listen to this cd is the emotional aspect of the songwriting by Ian Anderson and band. A darker,deeper, more heartfelt effort yet the lyrics are driven home with an incredible sense of passion and fury by the band. Even the slower numbers weave intricately around Ian Anderson's singing creating a sound not heard on earlier Tull releases. If you look at the line-up for this release you begin to realize the amount of talent at this time in the band. Many would consider Tull's next release \\"Aqualung\\" to be their masterpiece but \\"Benefit\\" should not be overlooked as it is an essential piece of Jethro Tull history and stands up very well on its own merits.
B000089RV6|5.0|What other band do you know could make a comeback after a tragic incident like the death of their lead singer. Enter AC/DC. Far superior than Highway to Hell, Brian Johnson adds strong vocals on every song on this cd. No disresepct to the Bon Scott era but this is AC/DC's best produced lyrically and musically. Hell Bells, What You Do For Money Honey, Back in Black, You Shook Me All Night Long, Shake a Leg, and Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution are the best songs on here. The whole album is good though. So get it because it is a true classic.
B000002KIE|5.0|they were smart and they wanted to tell everyone their views. they did and made good music out of it
B00004VW0V|2.0|This album lacks the healtfelt honesty of his early work, and lacks the creative energy of his later work.  If you enjoy R&B/soul then you might enjoy it.  If you like Cat's early work, you will probably dislike this album.  There's very few songs, and none of the songs stick out.  I especially dislike the record-length-long \\"Foreigner Suite\\".  It doesn't seem to go anywhere, and is filled with generic sounding instrumentals.  This album doesn't sound like Cat Stevens, it sounds like something you'd hear in Old Navy.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Everyone saying the clash suck, well you are wrong. London Calling is easily one of the best albums ever made. I truly have nothing to say but this album but it is a masterpiece. You think it sucks because they experimented with other genres. That is what was so talented about them. Yes there orginal stuff was good but this was just as good, maybe even better. Again, easily the best album ever made. A true work of art.
1594200106|5.0|If there was an Oscar award for best supporting character in a book Fermin would win with ease. Just take his quotes and philosophies on life from this book and you have the basis for a whole new novel. You can read the other reviews for a more in-depth look at the first rate story, and splendid writing/translation found within the pages. Be warned, you will not get Fermin, and his thoughts, out of your head once you have read this book. Excellent stuff!
B00005JNJT|4.0|The previous incarnation of the Batman franchise crashed and burned upon release. I was self-hating enough to catch the truly abysmal Batman and Robin on the big screen in Summer 1997. My expectations were low, but I was still gobsmacked at how bad the movie was. So bad, in fact, that Warner let the franchise cool for 8 years before rebooting. It was a long time for a cash cow to lie dormant, but Batman and Robin really was THAT bad.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan brings the character out of the gaudy, cartoonish world of Joel Schumacher and into reality for the story of Batman's origin. I'm quite sick of every single comic-book hero getting an origin story instead of just throwing us in at the deep end. The 1989 Batman didn't bother with origins and was able to further the plot without it. Despite the 140 minute run-time the plot of Batman Begins is side-tracked and 'last minute' when compared to the rest. Everything builds up to the last act but there's no consistent hook. Nolan also does himself favors, as well as shooting himself in the foot, by the naturalization of the character. The gorgeous anamorphic Panavision photography looks absolutely stunning, but I do miss the oppressive, German expressionist vision Gotham from the Tim Burton movies.<br /><br />The wide cast of actors all do well with their roles, despite getting relatively little screen time between them, though I never felt close to any of them. As with all Nolan films they're all so serious and straight it's hard to see a real human being behind them. I only ever see them as a plot function and never anyone I can identify with or recognize. The film is just too slick and confident. There are no rough edges, which I think would have made it much grittier.<br /><br />It's a good film, and light years ahead of Schumacher's embarrassment, but it's not as brilliant as the sycophants proclaim it to be.<br /><br />The Blu Ray features a stunning 1080p 2.40:1 picture with Dolby TrueHD sound and plenty of features.

B00005JMX6|5.0|Although the critics did not like this movie much (but well what do they really like?), there are many people, like me, who seemed to like or love it. After watching it on HBO, I went and bought it.  Let me tell you that this is the first and only movie I own.  The acting is awesome and the characters really make you fall in love with them.  See it, rent it, buy it, whatever you want.  but if you want to spend a Sunday afternoon with your other half, this is a great movie to watch. funny and romantic.
B00005JNJT|1.0|It's no Spiderman. <br />But Christopher Nolan finally got the feeling of a Batman movie right.  And Christian Bale was very good as Bruce Wayne.  We didn't get to see much of Batman after all.   <br />But the movie was too predictable and the storyline boring, and just a little too star-studded which came off as pompous.  I can only imagine where all these 5-star reviews are coming from: the 15 - 23 age group. <br /> <br />It was not a great movie.  The evil bad guy was obvious since they wouldn't knock out a big star from the plot like that so early.  Katie Holmes was so boring and lackluster as the girlfriend, truly whiny and dull.  She's no Kirsten Dunst in Spiderman that's for sure.  <br /> <br />
B00005U122|5.0|Oh my god, Get this DVD man. I was walking back home on a sunny afternoon in Wales. I visited the shop HMV to look around for some good cd/DVD. And there it was, no one told me!!How could they:( I grabbed it, paid for it, did not even say 'Thanks', I sped off like there was a herd of angry cows chasing after me. I popped this 'I-thank-God-for creating-Waters' DVD and I sailed. I sailed, I flew, I dreamed.....This is a killer. I only wished they had 'Great Gig In The Sky' as well. All tracks were superb, but 'Comfortably Numb' was a gift to us, the buyers. I guess we have to actually pay a little more for that song. Like 'WOW!\\"
B000957O7S|5.0|Hitch is a movie that hooks the viewer right from the start.  The plot is original and fun.  Will Smith plays his character, Alex Hitchens, brilliantly!  I found myself actually rotting for \\"Hitch\\", otherwise known as \\"The Date Doctor\\", to help his clients attract the attention, and hopefully love, from their favorite members of the opposite sex.<br /><br />Smith has once again proven his ability as a star on the big screen.  He and his costars, Eva Mendez (Sara), Kevin James (Albert), Amber Valletta (Allegra Cole), and Julie Ann Emery (Casey), worked magic on the screen.  I judge all movies by how well the film grabs me, taking me on a ride that I forget it isn't real life I'm seeing.  Hitch has such great chemistry between the actors and actresses that I actually forgot I was watching a movie and just sat back and enjoyed the interaction between characters.  The director did a good job cutting out some of the scenes originally included in the filming.  Those were the only scenes that didn't quite work.<br /><br />When Will Smith and Kevin James are on screen together, they are hilarious.  The two reminded me of the same on screen chemistry Chris Farley and David Spade used to have on screen.  Now throw in the amazing Eva Mendez and this turns into a film that just can't miss.<br /><br />Hitch tries to help Albert get the woman of his dreams to notice he is even alive.  But Hitch doesn't stop there.  He teaches Albert how to make Allegra Cole not only notice him; he teaches him how to make her fall in love with him.  I won't give away the entire plot.  I'll just say this: If you are looking for a movie that has a little bit of everything in it, especially a script that should bring a smile to your face, you needn't look any further.  This is the movie.<br /><br />See ya next review
0316172324|5.0|Malcom Gladwell, a staff writer for the New Yorker magazine, has written a fun little book that attempts to answer the following question: \\"Are we capable of making quick, accurate decisions based on very little information by harnessing the power of the subconscious mind?\\"<br /><br />When I first picked up this book, I was extremely skeptical. After all, the last thing we need is another dumb pop psychology screed that claims to reveal some shocking new \\"secret\\" about human nature. However, I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Gladwell's essay-length book is actually quite convincing -- even if you don't buy the whole argument for \\"adaptive subconscious reasoning\\" and \\"thin slicing.\\" Fun to read, too. Gladwell illustrates his case with some fascinating anecdotes from the worlds of fine art, pro sports, marriage, medicine, marketing, law enforcement and politics. He underpins his argument with research studies from academic and professional psychology. (Another Dr. Phil he ain't...)<br /><br />So why does this book make certain people so angry? The level of contempt and ridicule for Gladwell on these pages is amazing to me. He's not advocating shallowness or some metaphysical \\"eeny meeny chili beenie\\" approach to decision making. Rather, he's raising some legitimate points about our ability to reason in a hurry based on very limited information. Works wonders in some situations, and not so well in others.<br /><br />Is \\"Blink\\" the ultimate cosmic insight into the human psyche? Nope. But it sure is thought-provoking and innovative. Don't miss it.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Wow this is great!  Easily the best release of 2005 and will stand as one of the greatest recordings in music history IMO.  If you like previous Coldplay you will love X&Y.  <br /> <br />Highlights include \\"White Shadows\\", \\"The Hardest Part\\" and \\"Fix You\\" which is by far the best song on the album.   <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor and buy this CD.  Bravo Coldplay!
B000002JOH|5.0|I love this album. This is without a doubt an essential kick ass heavy metal masterpiece. I've had this album along with the rest of Pantera's albums ever since I was still in high school, and I still listen to it to this day forward. Vulgar Display of Power has it all: Awesome brutal vocals courtesy of Phil Anselmo, menacing bass lines from Rex Brown, great drumming from Vinnie Paul, and of course those memorable eye popping guitar solos courtesy of Dimebag Darrell(R.I.P). Every song on here is a classic. The opening track \\"Mouth For War\\" is a fast heavy favorite that kicks off this masterpiece. My personal favorite song on here is \\"Walk\\", which is one of Pantera's most memorable songs and a fan favorite as well. I just love that catchy riff at the beginng of that song. \\"This Love\\" has a very agressive chorus that you can just shout along to whenever you're in a bad mood, and \\"F**king Hostile\\", \\"Rise\\", and \\"A New Level\\" are other headbanging favorites as well. Like I said before, this album is an essential heavy metal masterpiece, and if you're into Pantera, heavy metal, or just GOOD music in general, \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\" is a must have in your collection. Pantera Rules, R.I.P. Dimebag!<br /><br />themetalbeast's ratings:<br /><br />1. Mouth For War: 5/5<br /><br />2. A New Level: 5/5(Love the lyrics)<br /><br />3.

B00005JNJT|5.0|I was fortunate enough to catch the June 6th screener of this movie.  Not only is this the best Batman movie so far, it's quite possibly the best comic book-based movie ever.<br /><br />Fair warning - if the wild neon lights and anatomically correct suits of the previous 2 films were your cup of tea, this movie is not for you.  In fact, unlike any of the previous films, this one centers on Bruce Wayne and his evolution into Batman.  He doesn't even appear in costume until halfway through the movie.<br /><br />Batman Begins is dark, intense, and completely faithful to the source material.  Christian Bale nails the parts of Batman and Bruce Wayne perfectly.  It also doesn't hurt that the supporting cast is stellar, featuring names like Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, Katie Holmes, Rutger Hauer, Liam Neeson and Michael Kaine.  The story flows fast and fierce, with few slow points.  There is even a perfect segue into a possible sequel in the movie's final scene.<br /><br />This movie comes with my highest possible recommendation.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|It's about time these guys came back with something new. Mezmerize just flat out rocks, I love it. \\"B.Y.O.B\\" is the best song on here, and my personal favorite on here as well. It starts off with some rapid firing guitar riffs and headbanging drums. Cigaro is another good song with some funny lyrics, and Violent Pornography, Revenga, The Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song and Radio/Video are other good songs on here as well. This album also contains great vocals from Serj Tankian, awesome guitar riffs and backing vocals from Daron Malakian, nice bass lines from Shavo Odadjian, and good drumming courtesy of John Dolmayan. I said it once and I'll say it again System Of A Down are just too good to be considered nu-metal in my opinion. Get this album now! S.O.A.D rocks 5 star album.<br /><br />themetalbeast's ratings:<br /><br />1. Soldier Side-intro: N/A<br /><br />2. B.Y.O.B.: 10/5(Best song, catchy chorus)<br /><br />3. Revenga: 5/5<br /><br />4.

0060005696|5.0|This could have easily been a fairly dry, quasi-academic tome on the psychology of decision making, but what makes this book great is that Swartz demonstrates the relevance of the psychology of decision making to so many aspects of our lives.  His general argument is that more choice is not necessarily good, and in fact, often makes our lives worse, rather than better. <br /> <br />Swartz divides decision makers into two general groups, satisficers and maximizers.  Satisficers consider options until they find that meets and minimum criteria, and then select that option.  Maximizers our constantly looking for the best selection, and are only satisfied with the best option.  As more options become available, clearly maximizers need to work harder to exhaust all possibilities, and in fact, they really can't.  We all have some \\"maximer\\" in us, but Swartz cites studies that indicate the most dedicated maximizers suffer from borderline depression. <br /> <br />Swartz also demonstrates that as more choice becomes available, people are generally less happy, not more.  More choice can lead to higher expectations, which may not be met.  More choice leads to a higher probability that one may long for a different choice, another road not taken.  Swartz cites a number of studies along the way, many of them with counter-intuitive results.  It is well researched from Swartz's experience, but I should stress it is pretty lively, easy to read book. <br /> <br />The finding here have relevance to public policy, sales and marketing, and the age old \\"finding happiness in ones life\\".  Swartz concludes the book but showing ways we can deal with the increasing number of choices in our life to get more satisfaction.
B0006L16N8|5.0|On of the most amazing things about Coldplay is their ability to turn music into poetry and back into music again. The song concepts are simple, but that's what makes them likeable. They weave in thoughtful ideas and questions without weighing you down. It's still entertainment. \\"X&Y\\" has proven itself worthy of many adjectives, but most notably, GREAT. <br /> <br />Favorite Song: \\"What if\\" - one of the best ballads ever written. This one stays with you.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Almost every band needs to evolve at a certain point of its history. For some bands, the evolution process is continuous - as the concept of progressive music righteously requires. Based on the definition of evolution, it is possible to say that, DT has been evolving since the day \\"When Dream and Day Unite\\" was released, for every DT album is at least slightly different than the other. However one thing remained unchanged and was dominant throughout every album: Display of extraordinary instrument playing skills. I consider \\"Octavarium\\" as an unexpected but long awaited step in the musical evolution of DT. <br /> <br />In Octavarium, the performances of LaBrie and Rudess seem to take the spotlight. For a very long time, I have never witnessed a better performance from James LaBrie. The vocal lines are strong and very melodic. Rudess and his keys are dominating the album and his performance is also outstanding. Myung's playing is greater than his ego as usual. <br /> <br />However, contradictory to my opinion that LaBrie and Rudess taking the spotlight, I feel that the real heroes of Octavarium are Portnoy and Petrucci. For the first time in DT history, I am hearing a less busy and streamlined playing from the duo, which I find to be quite professional and more mature. I was among the bigmouths who accused Portnoy and Petrucci for overplaying and for displaying a constant show of virtuosity - in TOT to be specific-. We all know how well these guys can play, and they do not have to and they should not try to prove anything to anybody at this stage of their musical development. Virtuosity, which should be used when necessary, should serve the music and the song, but vice versa is not preferable. At least this is what I've learned from the music of Rush, ELP, Marillion, Queensryche and 17 years of professional musicianship. I am not saying \\"less is more\\", but \\"more is definitely not always more\\". As a drummer I'd like to classify the drumming in Octavarium as \\"flawless\\"and hail Mike Portnoy. No extra or missing notes and definitely mature playing. The rhythmic progression in \\"Never Enough\\" is incredible. Same goes for Petrucci. The solo album seems to work well for him. <br /> <br />Except for the title track \\"Octavarium\\" and \\"Sacrificed Sons\\", the songs in Octavarium are less complex than the former DT songs, both in terms of composition and level of displayed virtuosity. However please note that, it is always more difficult to make a simple (for DT standards of course) song click. The first six songs really clicked for me after a couple of listening. Especially, \\"Root of All Evil\\", \\"Never Enough\\" and \\"These Walls\\". In addition \\"Sacrificed Sons\\" is a wonderful song. At first, it was very difficult for me to get into the title track \\"Octavarium\\", but now I really enjoy the masterpiece.  <br /> <br />I do not care if people blame DT for trying to be commercial. To me \\"Octavarium\\" is not an act of commercialization, but a successful attempt to write good music without overconsidering the aspect of virtuosity. It had to happen someday, and I'm glad that it happened. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007Y08IS|5.0|This is even better than the South Park movie.  At first I was a little hesitant to watch it, but when I finally did, I was so glad because I couldn't stop laughing.  The part about the towel used as a turbant still cracks me up.  This movie was so brainlessly funny, that I laugh just to think about it. This is not a movie with deep meaning, or deep messages, it's just a comedy that will make you laugh due to its silliness.  Highly, Highly recommended.
B0000039QA|3.0|Don't get me wrong being from NY i am acustomed to Big's amazing flow profound lyrics and tight beats. However i only listen to the Biggie songs i like and once i took a deep listen to some others on the album well it just falls short. The only songs i thought were amazing were Niggaz Bleed, Going back to cali, Notorious Thugz and You're Nobody (Till Somebody Kills you) which i think is the best song on the CD even though i may be the only person to think so. The album is just plain confusing at times. With a worthless song with Lil' Kim to a Remake of a song that used to be an anthem for homosexuals (Good choice of beats Pdiddy you sure know how to pick em.) It just goes on and on. Not to mention 5 or more songs about biggies paranoia that he was going to die. I understand we should respect that he did die and we was a great emcee but trust me even someone who thinks they like biggie will wonder why the topics on the album are so limited. Guests wise its ok. With a dull verse by Mase on one song. Another by Lil' Kim and an appearnce by GZA that isn't half bad. But only 1 guest song shines. Notorious Thugz with bone thugs n harmony is clearly the best guest song and one of the best songs on the album. Big's verse on it is OK but almost all the bone thugs outshine him.(His flow on it sounds extremely similar to Eminem's superman. Listen to both you'll see what i mean) In conclusion its not a BAD album but the 5 mic rating from the source that attracted so many to this album was more of a career thing since he died before the release. Its just not up to par with what a follow up to ready to die should have been.
B00006BTCA|4.0|I'm probably strange in that I absolultely detest both Antics and most of the \\"post-punk\\" music I've heard (Joy Division, Echo and the Bunnymen, Talking Heads, Television, ect, ect...) but really like this CD. The music isn't as transporting, stimulating, or creative as it could be, but I still find the songs here well-constructed and recorded nicely. \\"NYC\\" is probably the best song on here, both in terms of the mood it creates and how the lyrics relate to that mood, although \\"Untitled\\" and \\"The New\\" are also great. This has gotten several listens in the past week, maybe because I've had a general craving for structured and drone-ish music as opposed to some of the \\"freer\\" stuff in my collection.  <br /> <br />Even if you're not a fan of post-punk and indie rock (I'm certainly not!), there is something to like about this recording. It doesn't quite reach the point where I'd be willing to give it five stars, but it's good nonetheless and I would reccomend it for anyone curious about the band and its sound. Just to let you know, Antics is extremely boring and monotonous... probably THE most disappointing CD I've heard in terms of what went before it (before its release, I seriously thought these guys had a \\"Bends or \\"OK Computer\\" in them). Please stay away from it if at all possible and get this instead. If you like this and want something simmilar in terms of general feel (not sound), I'd recommend Sigur Rs - () and the Deftones' self-titled album.
B00005JNJT|5.0|I grew up watching all of the 'Batman' movies, yet somehow felt that it had all gone wrong after the first. Now, after seeing BATMAN BEGINS for the third time, I can confidently say that this is the best Batman film ever. I am anxiously awaiting the next film by Christopher Nolan, with the cast from this movie.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I really don't like what's happened to Star Wars. Eps 1-3, on their own, were poor films. They weren't unbearable, they were pretty enough (amazing production, design and effects) but lacking any kind of charm, urgency or tension. Taking them as part of the Star Wars whole, they are in worse shape. Not just because of the unfavourable comparisons they draw with the originals. But because of the undermining effect they have on characters and plot devices we're all familiar with (Darth Vader being whiny & sullen, the Force being a blood disorder etc). <br /> <br />Eps 1-3 remind me of a modern extension built onto an old house. Not only does it look wrong but the builders have also broken the original plumbing, made the roof leak and now there's a draft. Bigger, sure, but not as nice a place to live. But that's almost beside the point. What really bothers me about Star Wars is how the Special Editions of the original trilogy have supplanted the original prints forever. As George himself puts it (regarding the Ep IV re-release): <br /> <br />\\"I think of the film as The Special Edition. I don't think of it as the early version, any more than I would put early rough cuts on. I could put four or five rough cuts onto the thing and say, 'This is how it advanced.' I consider The Special Edition as being the final version at this point. I don't even worry about the other ones, because it went through a lot of incarnations to get to the final stage.\\" <br /> <br />I can understand wanting to tinker and refine something you've done in the past, but I want to watch the films I watched as a child, and I am very uncomfortable with it being revised (something which George himself understands): <br /> <br />\\"(Talking about the colourisation of black and white film) I am very concerned about our national heritage, and I am very concerned that the films I watched when I was young and the films that I watched throughout my life are preserved so that my children can see them.\\" <br /> <br/>There have been other examples of re-edited versions of films supplanting their original incarnations but I can't think of any example so well known and so important to modern cinema. Given George's own views I find these sweeping revisions, twenty years after the fact, baffling. I do still own copies of the \\"early versions\\" but the tapes in my VHS Star Wars boxed set are getting a little crackly, Empire is chewed up a little on the opening crawl (and my VHS player as seen better days too). Now as I don't have a Laser Disc player and probably couldn't afford to buy the disks on eBay that's as good as I or anyone else, is going to legally get. The films as they were no longer exist in a legal, sustainable form and that bothers me. George, of course, has the legal right to change his IP as much as he wants, but I think it damages cinema as a whole for him to do so. <br /> <br />There is a guy, a SFX professional called Mike Verta who is re-mastering the original Star Wars in his spare time. In his website's editorials he talks quite eloquently and personally about art and the responsibilities of those who create it: <br /> <br />\\"There's a lot of talk about artists' rights these days, but very little talk about an artist's responsibility. It's true that George Lucas can round up every remaining print of Star Wars and fire them into the sun if he wants (die hard purists feel he's pretty much done this already), but that doesn't mean it's a good idea, and to me, it's an abdication of an artist's first responsibility. <br /> <br />I often use this analogy: When I was 4, I drew a picture of our family and gave it to my mom. It was very crude, but she cherishes it to this day. I never intended it to be something special, but it came to mean the world to her, for all sorts of reasons. Today I could draw a much better picture. But if her drawing was fading, if the paper was disintegrating, and I was the only one who could preserve it, and I replaced it with one I drew today, it would crush her. It would never be the same. I'm the artist - it IS my right to change it. I can do whatever I want. But it would be almost cruel to do so. Now, as much as my mom loves that drawing, it didn't change her life; it certainly didn't change the world. But Star Wars did change the world - in countless ways. <br /> <br />I consider Star Wars every bit as historically significant as Romeo and Juliet, and while many people seem content to witness the obliteration of the original version of this movie, there are very few people who would advocate Shakespeare's writing in a wacky sidekick for Romeo, if he could. With our VHS tapes disintegrating, and our laserdisc players not able to be serviced anymore, this incredibly important piece of history is in danger of being lost forever. <br /> <br />The poet Paul Valry said, \\"A poem is never finished, only abandoned.\\" To the artist, this means that you may be forever dissatisfied with your work... fighting the desire to change it as your life experiences change you, and you increase your mastery of your craft. The temptation to do so is sometimes nearly overwhelming. But the subtler message of this quote is that the world is full of poems... so abandoning them is necessary, if they are to make an impression on the world.\\"
B000957O82|4.0|I generally don't like formula movies. \\"Hitch\\" is a comedy based on a formula going back decades and decades - boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl. Yawn! But Will Smith is such a great actor that he's able to take a stale script and turn this movie into something quite enjoyable. Add to his performance a great comedic turn by Kevin James, and you've got one very predictable but very funny movie.  <br /> <br />Smith plays Hitch, A New York City matchmaker. Gauging from his lifestyle, he's a success. His latest client is a big, goofy guy [James], who's secretly in love with a beautiful heiress. Hitch grooms the guy in all the right moves. Meanwhile, Hitch meets a girl [Eva Mendes] who will turn his life upside down.  <br /> <br />The plot is absurd. It's the performances that make this movie work. Smith and James make it something both touching and loud out loud funny.  <br />
B00005JNJT|5.0|Anger can hold our intellects hostage as it did the young Bruce Wayne.  Carmine Falcone tells him, \\"Don't come down here with your anger, trying to prove something to yourself. This is a world you'll never understand. And you always fear what you don't understand.\\"  Wayne does well with this advice, and how.  <br /> <br />Michael Keaton is now a *distant* second in the hierarchy of Movie Batmen.  And Michael Caine makes all previous Alfreds look like fancy pants sissy-boys.  Highly Recommended!
B000957O7S|5.0|My sister went to the movies and saw this movie with her boyfriend, they both had really liked it and thought it was one of Will's best films. My husband had wanted to see it (well sort of he was going to give it a shot b/c of Will Smith) so when it came out of video we watched it and oh boy it has got to be one of the most funniest movie that Will Smith has been in. It is the perfect \\"date\\" movie it his aimed at guys and gals...at the end my husband looked at me and smiled, \\"Now that is a chick flick I can handle!\\"
B000065U1N|4.0|WAR or HELP! This movie has an incredible cast. Every actor deserves a medal of honor for the heroic characters they played. Good detail, good sound. <br /> <br />My favorite part: <br /> <br />Josh Harnett (Sgt. Matt): You going back in? <br />Eric Bana (Sfc. Norm 'Hoot'): There are still men out there. <br /> <br />Eric Bana (Sfc. Norm 'Hoot'): when i go home, people ask me hey why do you do it man - why? you're some kind of war junkie? <br /> <br />Eric Bana (Sfc. Norm 'Hoot'): i won't say a god damn word - why? <br />Eric Bana (Sfc. Norm 'Hoot'): they won't understand <br />Eric Bana (Sfc. Norm 'Hoot'): they won't understand why we do it <br />Eric Bana (Sfc. Norm 'Hoot'): they wont understand its about the men next to you. <br /> <br />Eric Bana (Sfc. Norm 'Hoot'): that's it! thats all it is!
0451196716|5.0|I've read everything published by Stephen King, and this story is by far my favorite. What makes this my favorite story is how the tension of life vs. death is constant, (stop walking and you die) so you don't want to stop reading, because you have to know which of the likeable and unlikable characters avoids the ever watching guards, and which ones tire and pay the ultimate price. The story is a metaphor for life, in that life also is like a long road you must keep walking on, or die. Also, `The Long Walk' is not as 'over the top' in unreal horror as SK's usual.
