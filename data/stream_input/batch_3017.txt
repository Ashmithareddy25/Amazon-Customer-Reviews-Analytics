B005PK56TA|5.0|very good, story line good im a big horror fan, hoping for more seasons to come, or episodes enjoyed it thanks
B00FEN1C50|3.0|After deciding which movie to buy/rent I decided on \\"Pacific Rim\\".  All the reviews Ive read and watched about the movie said it was amazing. They all said it had so much feeling and action but I didn't really feel it.<br /><br />I saw on the trailer of a great speech that the general gave and the trailer made it look like there was more to the speech, like everyone was getting riled up, but it was short and not as emotional as I thought. I was really looking forward to that part too.<br /><br />All the reviews said how it was action packed on the edge of your seat; not so much, maybe on a 50 foot screen. I like to feel like I could be in the fight when I see one in a movie, but I couldn't imagine it with this movie much. The most I felt was when the two guys were fighting in the hallway, not when the 300 foot robot was fighting the 500 foot monster.<br /><br />I read a review that I didn't get till the end. You always had swords in the robot and didn't use them? Instead you used a cargo ship as a staff (for only 20 seconds) to draw back on their earlier peer fight (more pointless than useful). Also at the end when they used the swords as if they were suppose to be that all mighty definitive weapon, but they always use their plasma cannons...<br /><br />I did watch the whole movie in 2-3 sittings, maybe that took away from the movie a bit but it wasn't what I expected.<br /><br />The Its always Sunny from Philly guy seems like the same character just as a scientist version. The main character seems like he could have been effected a bit more by his brothers death. We don't see how he really works through the death of his brother. The Japanese girls past took so long to reveal by the time it happened it was already assumed and half way confirmed. The extra credits mentioned how different nations contributed to piloting the robots, but they didn't go into their characters really. There is just enough given to get who the characters are, but not enough to actually getthem all the way where they are suppose to be.<br /><br />Overall I would rate it as a 3-3.5 star movie. It seems like it wanted to be a \\"we need the best man for the job that is always the decommissioned, damaged, troubled pilot that is working through his own problems while trying to help others with theirs\\"  and I love those type of movie but they just missed. They seemed to focus on things that they didn't need to and not enough on the parts they did need to. I regret buying it for $15.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Another season of great tv. A plateful of suspense, plot twists and surprises for your consumption. Did I mention the great acting ?
B00EY8A6BC|2.0|Watch this movie of it is free on Netflix or Amazon.<br />I am glad I didn't spend $9 to see this movie in a theater.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Classic set that any movie fan should have in their personal collection. Blue ray quality goes without saying, extra material on discs is good
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Relaxing and fun especially on a rainy day ! Love the background music while playing.  Very calm and soothing.  Great scenes .
B0044WSF5M|5.0|Nostalgic, fun to watch and still holds up after all these years. Check out Richard Dreyfus and Harrison Ford, among many other now well known stars,  younger than young! Cool flick.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful character study in the finest PBS tradition.  I am always afraid I will not make it through another hiatus.  MORE MORE MORE!!!!!!!!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|An interesting story but a mismash of characters and events.  The 'secret' seemed obvious to me halfway through and  also some of the details revealed at the conclusion of the story were obvious.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|This product might be okay if I didn't have a blue -ray player that already streams Netflix, Hulu and you tube. I was disappointed that I would have to purchase movies and tv shows from Google movies. I was kind of hoping that it would stream tv shows from my computer to my tv so I could get rid of cable. That is not the case, so for me it was a waste of money. It might be great for someone who doesn't have a wifi ready blue-ray player.
B00EVPSJOE|5.0|This is a review of the October 2013 release of the 2CD+DVD package &#34;Deluxe Edition&#34; box set.<br /><br />The original disc of Unplugged scarcely needs another review from me because there are plenty of informative views on it already published. I will just say that, as a fully paid-up Clapton devotee of over 45 years standing, I think it's one of his very finest albums, full of great songs, brilliant guitar work and fine, sincere singing from Eric. The band are excellent and the overall effect is stunning - it really is a Classic Album in my view. If you don't already own the original, don't hesitate - this is a very generous package for the price and you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />The question is, do those of us who have already bought it (twice, in my case: once on cassette and once on CD) need this Extended Edition? There are two additions to the original album: a short disc of six extra tracks and a DVD of the performances recorded on the original album plus some rehearsal material. Personally, I'm not that fussed about owning the DVD because I prefer to just listen, and for me the Bonus Tracks disc doesn't add enough to make it worth buying the whole lot again. Like a lot of &#34;bonus material,&#34; what it really shows is that they chose the best stuff for the original album. Worried Life Blues is the only really worthwhile track among the bonus tracks, I think. We get two very similar takes of My Father's Eyes and one of Circus, neither of which is a particularly great song, and there are also the rejected takes of Running On Faith and Walking Blues which add nothing to the original album versions.<br /><br />My verdict (for what it's worth) is that this is an excellent value set if you don't have the fabulous original, and I've given it five stars on that basis. But if you already have Unplugged I'm not sure I'd bother with this too. If you'd like to have the DVD it may well be worth buying this again, but for me it doesn't really add enough to the original to make it worth the expense if you already own it.to the original to make it worth the expense if you already own it.
B004GJXQ20|4.0|An excellent read. Made so much better by having seen the TV series. Looking forward to reading the next book.
B005F96URI|4.0|I had no idea what to expect when I saw this, but it was a very cool surprise. A fun story, interesting way of telling it, over the top fight scenes, and it kept me glued to the tube.
B002QCAXOS|3.0|Sort of kept my interest, but could have been much better.  Suspense could have been better played out.<br />The gratis scenes of Britt Eckland shaking about could have been snipped.
B0025KW29U|5.0|Goofy, fun, wrong, and awesome all at the same time! You cant help yourself from singing along with this already cult classic!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really enjoyed the book-great beach read.  I flew through it - i would definitely recommend this book, its very clever.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|The revamp of my childhood continues to be great...but ONLY in the Star Trek universe! There were a few plot holes and story issues for the overly picky, but all-in-all it was a very fun movie and great momentum for the franchise.<br /><br />Keep em' coming!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|A very different read, I thought it was well written and has some interesting twists and turns that keep you engaged.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|this game needs more time don't buy this game. I repeat do not buy this app it sucks so don't download this app.
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|Just finished reading this on the iPad. It was pretty great! Only wish that the pictures could've been of more high quality.<br />You also can't zoom in on the pictures, only the words.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love how this app doesn't scam you and you get your diamonds back its a really  fun game and there's no glitches.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|If you're thinking about making new company on the market this book may really help you. Easy to read and what more important to understand. You'll learn not only how to make good MVP but also how to manage it. You don't know what is MVP? That mean you need to get Running Lean.<br /><br />I really love this book.
B00FEX2ZFG|4.0|Great story and cinematography.<br /><br />I wish Amazon would get with Apple so that the ipad can be connected to a big screen TV for movies.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Just filling this out so I can go ahead a d read the next one.. Thanks to the free app
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it I think it is so cute and its actually fun.<br />its kind of like temple run but more fun.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I must not have read the reviews carefully enough, because I thought this was a launch the hedgehog/fly the paper airplane type game, where you try to reach certain heights and buy upgrades to improve your progress. I was mistaken, but that is my own fault. Despite that the game is not what I thought, I am enjoying it. Not a lot of scenery change and not so challenging as to be frustrating. The little jetpack dude runs and flies while collecting coins and avoiding missiles and zappers. Along the way, he can make use of gadget boxes that give him a vehicle to use. I highly recommend using the vehicles as much as possible, because though they are not the easiest to control, they provide an additional buffer that allows jetpack man to keep going. What I find so entertaining about this game, which is not the kind I would normally play, are the interesting challenges to be met for levelling up, such as high fiving 10 scientists, or ending the game between 300-400 meters.  In the latter instance (which can be harder than you might think), the challenge  is geared toward how poorly you can play, which I find quite humorous. I must be no Hiccup, because the only vehicle I am far from mastering is the Dragon (ironically named Mr. Cuddles). This game is part of Amazon's 20 coin promotion, and it is free, so I would encourage you to give it a try, even if it isn't your typical gameplay. Although, if you delete it, you might have your coins revoked. I don't plan on deleting it though, because it is unexpectedly too much fun.
B002M9WW30|4.0|i liked the addtional discs that were included. this package completes my collection.... and it's in a really neat box... hahaha
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show is perfect for those dark stormy nights huddled up on the couch.  You better have somebody sitting next to you though cause otherwise...you're gonna freak out.
B004OBQDHK|4.0|wished the DVD versions was also included. it is a good version to have on blue ray. with the high-intensity film
B006LSZECO|3.0|The plot in the book was thrilling and you wanted to keep reading to find out what would happen next. However, the amount of dirty language was NOT necessary. That  made it good but definitely not great.
B00C061I1M|5.0|I bought this CD after hearing her on David Letterman Show. She is an unbelievable talent! I highly recommend this CD!
B00684J49U|5.0|My wife loves it what more do I have to say and I think its good and the women are hot
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I enjoyed every page of this book.  It was touching, humorous and insightful.  I sent books to my nieces and nephews so that they could experience it as well.
B00EU9VCKO|1.0|Couldn't try it out because it wouldn't load any photo on my phone. It may work great if it would.
B0091LRZZW|5.0|I simply enjoyed it - the laid-back jazz, with drums being swept instead of pounded, and Sir Paul's charm made a most delightful listen.<br />By the by, I do not like sites that ask my opinion, and then demand that I do it THEIR  way.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|great movie I don't usually rate movies but this one was great I recommend watching it if you like that kind of movie
B00E3IZIM0|3.0|The movie excites my inner child because it is the movie version of the games I use to play with robot legos and monsters. My only complain is that you are forced to use the UV digital copy. As an apple person I like keeping all of my content in iTunes and available on my iPad and Apple TV.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's challenging enough to be fun.  But not so difficult that you get discouraged.  Worth the download and<br />A good cure for boredom
B000B8QG4A|4.0|We loved it but mostly because We are huge Disney fans of Walt Disney movies.  My kids and I loved it.
B00FN811SY|5.0|Fabulous App I gave it 5 stars and would give it five more if I could. I would recommend it to anyone who has the ability to download it.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|This is a totally different book but really fun to read. You can expect to be surprised and really start to like the characters. May even reread it.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I purchased this for my12 year old granddaugther.  I'm told that it didn't get put down at her birthday party.
B00ESB75FA|5.0|This is truly one of the best shows on tv. It makes my evening whenever I watch it, if you get home in a bad mood just watch it and it will brighten your day
B00EO4SBSG|5.0|I'm the first reviewer, yay!  But besides that, great album!  Different from the rest of their stuff, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  My personal favorites are: No Way to Heal, To Believe, Villainy Thrives.  Not a huge fan of the bonus tracks, but whatever, they're still good.  Grab it now, give it a few test runs, you won't be disappointed.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I am a huge Stephen King fan and this book definitely did not disappoint. It's not The Shining 2 and that needs to be made clear. This is what happened after, where did they go and who did they become. I did wonder what ever became of Danny. How much of a scar did all that happened leave on him. I have to wonder now, after reading this, will be there an Abra book to come?
B000I9X67W|5.0|This is really a fun movie.  I loved it and so did my kids.  It doesn't feature any top Hollywood &#34;stars&#34; but is well acted and the drumming is real and there's lots of it!
B00FVS3RZQ|5.0|I love The Walking Dead and I love how easy Amazon makes it for me to be able to enjoy it anytime and anywhere. I download to my Kindle Fire HD watch and then take them off. I can re-add them at any time and do keep my favorite episodes loaded at all times for those long doctors office waits!
B00FPGV3RS|3.0|I think that R.I.P.D. is better than the reviews that I seen out there. Jeff Bridges IS the best part as an ol' cowboy with a &#34;won't take no for an answer&#34; attitude. This can be ruined by his love for his hat that he won't shut up about. Ryan Reynolds plays the same character he plays in all of his movies, so if you love him anything you'll love him here.  The worst problem with the film is that Jeff's and Ryan's characters, when seen through the eyes of a human-living or dead-they are shown as a attractive blonde female and a creepy old Chinese man. Yet when the dead-o's (what they call the souls that won't go through judgement) pop and become monsters, THAT can bee seen by everyone no problem. Even worse is that the dead-o's cause plants to die and electronics to fail, including light bulbs flickering when they pass by and yet no one seems to go &#34;When the creepy guy walks by my stuff breaks.&#34; So with all that in mind I'd rent it before buying.
B00DTMCSO2|4.0|Seems easy. Just read the instructions. But try to remember everything as you go. If not you will surely get off course, crash and landing is harder then it looks. Nevertheless still a good elementary game in learning to fly with all the basics given here.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|Lady Gaga's the fame monster album has been out for a long time so obviously I knew what I was getting when I purchased it. It's fun and full of great Gaga hits.
B00006JSS8|5.0|My first Stevie Wonder CD and it's AMAZING! If your a Stevie Wonder fan this is a fantastic cd to own.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|This movie will be way better than you think it will be!! I didn't think it was going to be anywhere near as good as it turned out to be.
B000HF0ILY|4.0|it is a high quality movie, hopefully the next time that we view something on Amazon, it won't come in so choppy.
B00AEFXXMI|5.0|Who does'nt love Matthew Broderick in Ferris Buller this movie will still be watched 20 yrs from now and still will be raved as a great movie. Love Love Love,
B00EQF0JJC|3.0|A little tough to stay with some of the dialogue but a good movie.  Full-screen view was not a full screen view- 21&#34; diag. on a 40&#34; screen.
B000LC4ZF8|5.0|Wow What a classic Tom Hanks at one of his best .It was nice to see a movie that made you feel good and take you back to a time when life was easier.
1439107955|5.0|so glad i got it, heard about it on KPBS and immediately searched for it<br />great research tool, highly recommend it, vivian
B00006B1HH|5.0|Grease is right up there with Dirty Dancing both Classic movies from a time when life was good and simple. Love to watch it snuggled up on the couch.
B00516G6ME|5.0|All jokes aside this is one amazing piece to own for collectors and One Piece lover's alike. It's by far the biggest figure I own and stands out like an foreign exchange student; in a good way. Franky is just one of those character's where you can't help but say &#34;Cool!&#34; every time you see him. The details are spot on, the quality is definitely there, and for the price...well let's just say I was not disappointed.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is one of the best games I have ever played. So well done from the art to the creative puzzles. I am more and more impressed as the game progresses. Bravo!!!
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|I am new to learning french and I have  found this app to be fun and informative.  I have enjoyed myself and picked up quite a few vocab words along the way.  I have found it very helpful to consult a French textbook for clarification or explanation of grammatical rules.  I also have a lot of trouble with the microphone feature, not use  if it just doesn't work or if my French accent is just that bad.  Overall, it's been fun and it's hard to beat the pricetag.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I would give this movie an 8.5 out of 10.  Visually stunning!  Acting is strong but the story is a little weak.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I Love it! It is really gruesome but cool. I like the part when Rue gets killed and katniss sings to her dead body as Rue`s last wish.
B00FPH6A70|3.0|It was entertaining but not as scary as I thought it would be.  I would recommend it to others and I would probably watch it again.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|This calculator app is awesome. Simple yet it has everything you need in a basic calculator. I love it because even though it's a basic calculator it includes the percentages button which many basic calculators don't have. Works great!
B0064MGU98|3.0|The plot has potential but the execution of the storyline is so very predictable that it seems boring.  Lots of wasted talent!  Just shake up the script and this could be really good.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was not so difficult that I couldn't pass the levels, yet it really challenged my thinking process! Lots of fun!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I play this game every day! If I can't sleep, I play a few games to relax, or if I'm waiting in the doctor's office, I play a few games to pass the time. Really fun! I've had this game for over a year now, and I still enjoy it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! It is fast pace and I play against my daughter on her device. Hers, though, updates a few days before mine so we are not one the same &#34;page&#34; so to speak.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Firstly, I'm going to go ahead and admit that I'm probably one of the stingiest people I know when it comes to buying mice and keyboards.<br />That being said, I expected to get exactly what I paid for when I purchased the Anker 8k DPI Gaming Mouse. I was mistaken.<br />Considering the pricetag on this guy, it is without a doubt one of the more affordable gaming mice out there. Sitting well under my<br />self-imposed $100 limit, I prepared myself for the worst when I opened my packaging. I'd read the other reviews about how some mice were<br />falling apart, or cheaply made, but this mouse has been nothing but a godsend since it arrived. Aside from a handful of nitpicks that I<br />have about the actual design of the mouse, it has not only met my expectations, but far surpassed them. It is everything I was looking for<br />in a mid-range gaming mouse. In short;<br /><br />Pros:<br />  - Pin-point accurate cursor for anything from frantic gunfights to well-aimed sniper shots<br />  - Completely programmable mouse buttons make on-the-fly customization a breeze<br />  - Three easy-access thumb buttons ideal for anything between browsing through media to dominating in your favorite FPS game<br />  - Ergonomic design fits the contours of your hand, perfect for long nights spent honing your skills<br />  - Wide, customizable DPI ranges to accommodate every need; from Casual Gamer to MLG<br />  - Comparable to any other gaming mouse on the market, within the same price bracket<br />  - Weight cartridges included to help you find the perfect balance of speed and precision.<br />  - Ridged rubber panel underneath thumb buttons helps with grip and control<br />  - Custom LED colors on the Anker logo?<br />  - The friggin' thing is covered in LEDs.<br /><br />Cons :<br />  - Macro function has limited functionality<br />  - \\"Macro\\" button (still re-programmable) feels a little sloppy<br />  - Rubber panel seems like it attracts grease & sweat<br />  - Middle mouse wheel feelslike the ratcheting could be a bit tighter<br />  - Anker logo is the only customizable color, rest of the LEDs stay blue (very minor nitpick, all things considered)<br />  - The little container that the weights come in feels cheaply made and is a pain to open(?)<br /><br />TL;DR you should probably buy this mouse, especially if it stays around $50 (as it is at the time of this review). I've used this mouse<br />for a solid 2 months, and it has yet to leave me stranded in the middle of a firefight.
B000I3UAJ0|4.0|This movie is not for the easily bored. It's pacing bogs-down here and there, the pay-off is a bit underwhelming, the pajamas -- I mean &#34;uniforms&#34; -- are comical, the performances are alternately stilted or limp, and you have to keep on reminding yourself that it's a Trek film. On the other hand, there are some really cool effects sequences, and the V'ger flyover is probably one of the most impressive miniature sequences I've ever seen.<br /><br />That being said, it's a fascinating film when you take into consideration that the filmmakers were trying to reconcile the original television series with the last sci-fi cinema blockbuster: 2001. That, more than anything, gave me a better understanding of what, on it's own, is a wet noodle of a film -- at best. It wasn't until the second film that the franchise really found itself, so forgive its awkward adolescence.
B00FAXLCWW|4.0|Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!....I stumbled upon Haim by chance via amazon music store. I listened to a few tracks and was sold. Yes Haim your music is blaring on my speakers all the way in Hawaii.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|The blood and gore is secondary when you become cognizant of the fact that these people are trying to survive and learning to lead lives much different from the world they previously knew before.  It is the dynamics between the people that fascinates me.  My first inclination when I see survivors is to immediately feel empathetic and think &#34;take them back to your camp,&#34; but then you quickly come to realize you cannot trust that everyone has the same intentions as you do...to build community, relationships, safety, etc.<br />Some people complain about it being boring and yes there are too many commercials, but how else are they going to pay for this show to air.  I have strong suspicion they read the last chapter of the book before they have even begun the first. It isn't always action, kill, slice, cut, shoot, etc. There is a human element to this show about zombies; which I do not actually believe is about the zombies, it is about the people who were &#34;lucky&#34; enough to not have been caught....yet.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The Bible is a book that has great historical information. The Bible has stood the \\"test of time\\" and serves as \\"the main source\\" for  Christian living. I believe it the surpasses the sale of any other book on a yearly basis..
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Really Interesting and fun game!  Puzzles are fun and not just busy-work - you find needed items in the hidden object tasks.  I liked the mystery of the story, the graphics and the ease of the game.  The Journal and Map helped as guides when you were uncertain of where to go next (little hints that keep you on task without you getting to frustrated). Hours of fun and a very enjoyable game.<br /><br />This is a free trial that introduces you to the game - if you like it and want to continue you must pay to receive the full game.
B00DYWKPAQ|5.0|Kings of Leon is such a great band, awesome music, great for the whole family, purchases all 5 CDs from Amazon, I enjoy all of them.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I enjoyed the book. I wish the getting married part was written better. It seemed not really emotional.  I wish it would. I enjoyed Eva and Gideon and how much better they understood eachother. The best was that she stopped being so jelous and became more mature. Can't wait for Captivated by You.
B00EVCD9HY|5.0|I love the whole album. Personally,she reminds me of a female Prince!This album has been on repeat since I firsf bought it!!
B009UX2YAC|1.0|this app stinks. it all ways freezes. and it makes my kindle freeze app. don't waste your time with this game
0545586178|5.0|This is a great book to read.  I have been purchasing for my daughter and she loves the book she is reading the last one now.
0670024813|4.0|This is a long book (perhaps longer than it should be). Despite its excessive length, and being no \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" it is a very worthwhile book. You do need to have some patience to read it. I suggest you allot yourself some time to read the book. I bought it when it was released, but I couldn't initially pass off the first chapter. So I leave it in my bookshelf for several months until I found myself the time to read it.<br /><br />The book aims to explore the lives of hunter gatherers/native peoples. It concentrates on the people of the island of New Guinea, a place which Diamond has regularly visited for the last 50 years, discussing extensively many anecdotes he has there. He compares the lives of hunter gatherers with the lives of people living in the world's most developed countries. He believes that at least in some respects the lives of today's hunter gatherers is healthier than the lives of people living in the world's most technologically advanced societies. One example is diet. Like the followers of the paleodiet, Diamond believes that hunter gatherers diet is far superior to the western one, noticing that there is virtually no obese people among natives still living their traditional lifestyle. When native peoples drop their healthy diet and adapt western food habits (heavy on sugar, salt, oils, grains and dairy products), their weight shoots up, and with it associated diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease.<br /><br />I also like the book's sophisticated discussion of religion and its frank discussion of violence among native people (some organizations advocating for native peoples didn't like the fact that Diamond writes very matter of factly about the inter and intra tribal violence that exists in native groups. Diamond is only talking the truth. And is unfair to point at Diamond, since the affection he feels for native peoples -especially those of New Guinea - is clear) .
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|Fans of Paul McCartney's music and the legend that he helped to create with his former band The Beatles.  And after listening to NEW, McCartney's 2013 album may have mixed feelings based on his previous works that many praised and raved because they bore similar musical styles to his solo and band efforts that were straight forward in their tone and melody - a Beatle-like or ballad-pop Paul.  NEW is Paul simply being new and somewhat experimental as he has always approached every new project, it just happened to fall in place.  One wonders, why?  Paul McCartney is an artist musically and creatively, especially when listening to this album.<br /><br />With the enormous repertoire of songs in McCartney's catalog of compositions, is there anymore that he can produce and show on this record?  Indeed, NEW [Deluxe Edition] contains 14 tracks that are all memorable and completely different.  Of course, the diehard McCartney or Beatle listeners will most likely compare each and every track to melodies of other Mac-Beatle song, or even bands and artists that have influenced McCartney through his musical journey, especially the Beach Boys, Wings, and former band mate John Lennon or even McCartney taking renderings from his own solo work.  Listening to this record also bears similarities to the tone of 2001's Driving Rain - a bit different and also tinged on he blending his expected ballads with a mix of new danceable and semi-noisy rhythms, it almost has a sound of that album - he picked up where that album left off until he returned to the Beatle-like songs of Chaos and Creation and Memory Almost Full.  But from this listener's perspective, the title track \\"New\\" and the playful \\"Queenie Eye\\" contain a sound and melody of the Pepper days and Magical Mystery Tour but is reminiscent of the tongue-in-cheek Rutles.  The rest of the songs resonate of the early sound of McCartney's solo work and the beginnings of Wings but also his pre-Beatle days with John Lennon, \\"On My Way to Work\\" and \\"Early Days\\" has a very early Liverpool days sound that imaginatively sounds like John echoing back; the rhythm of the songs have a Lennon-McCartney feel.<br /><br />But aside from the comparisons, this is an interesting album that cannot be compared to any one album that Paul McCartney has released in the past.  The songs and the liner notes that came with the CD provides a background information to the production of the album as well as the small lyric book that has all the words to each of the songs so that fans may sing along.rk\\" and \\"Early Days\\" has a very early Liverpool days sound that imaginatively sounds like John echoing back; the rhythm of the songs have a Lennon-McCartney feel.<br /><br />But aside from the comparisons, this is an interesting album that cannot be compared to any one album that Paul McCartney has released in the past.

B0064X7FVE|4.0|This app has been helpful because I have relatives spread out all over states and its so easy to be apprised of the weather conditions.  It makes me feel closer to them.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I picked this book because of it's number one rating on Yahoo and I was not disappointed.  I love the writer's style.  Her story was thought provoking and I found myself imagining myself in the same situation of every female character in this story.  Can't wait to read another book by this author.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I noticed some people are having trouble with update info on all versions or editions if you're having trouble finding what's being added go to minecraft wiki to see 0.9.0,<br />really massive update!!!!
B00479SVBU|1.0|I bought two of these, one for me and the other for a friend. Both were useless garbage within a week. My friends just fried with an sd card inside for no apparent reason and surprisingly the protective fuse in the plug in part did not blow to provide the protection that was intended.<br />The second item just came apart at the plug in point and the screw on cap does not hold it together.<br /><br />Bottom line is that I am out $70 bucks with no useable product.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Cute, durable, washable, and fits easily into little hands. Also, very difficult to lose! I get a lot of compliments on these and own 3 total.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my kids and I love to play this game! I could play it all day. the challenges are cool too.
B003B02O0A|4.0|A Time to Kill is being reissued, as Jake Brigance is back in court again in Grisham's new book, Sycamore Row.<br /><br />This well crafted legal thriller is a pager turner that is hard to set down as bigotry and racism cause \\"burning crosses and the crack of sniper fire spread through the streets\\". It is John Grisham's first, and he says one of his favorite novels.<br /><br />Grisham heard the story of a young rape victim and started a book exploring the \\"what if\\" her father was a black Vietnam Vet who killed her white assailants on the courthouse steps.  Lawyer Jake Brigance must find a way to defend him.  Grisham set the novel in the vocation he knew, the area he lived, and populated it with characters that were an amalgam of people he lived near. The plot is well thought out and moves naturally.  The believable main characters have human flaws and may hide a dark side.
B006IMY5ZU|5.0|Great story, especially for anyone who loves baseball and wants to understand the business side of the game.  I need to read the book.
B00E9P959O|5.0|I always knew the material on the album was good stuff, but has always been uncomfortable to listen to it.  It was like wadded up plastic wrap in my ears with the volume up too loud on a cheap boombox. The remix sounds like a true Rush album.  Now I can begin to appreciate it!
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I did love this game until I spent hours on it just to have it crash around level 24 with no answers from support. Cute game if you don't mind starting ALL over with no help from support. Definitely do not spend real money on it because you will lose it.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This book is packed with non stop action worthy of the Last Battle.  A climatic ending to the great series.  Thank you Jordan and Sanderson!
B00CTT9646|5.0|This Star Trek movie is great to say the least. Good acting and lots of action. The best is the QMX phaser. Super accurate paint job and rotating barrel make this prop a great addition to an collection.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Totally love this game spend hours playing, although too impatient to wait for energy so have spend some money on this game
0525478817|4.0|\\"The Fault In Our Stars\\" is a book about a young girl named Hazel Grace Lancaster. Hazel tries to lead the life of a normal sixteen-year-old girl even though she suffers from stage IV thyroid cancer with metastasis in her lungs. Hazel's over protective mother and father make her attend a cancer support group every week. There she meets seventeen-year-old Augustus Waters, who is in remission but lost his leg to osteosarcoma. Augustus immediately takes a strong liking to Hazel Grace and eventually falls in love with her. \\"The Fault In Our Stars\\" does an exceptional job of capturing the devastating effects that cancer can have on people, but it also does an exceptional job of highlighting the ways cancer can bring people and families together. The book may be interpreted in many ways, such as the classic boy meets girl love story, or a teenage girl trying to find the value of life. I find the characters in \\"The Fault In Our Stars\\" very relatable to young teens despite the fact that the characters have cancer. The story is also relatable to most parents, whether their child has cancer or they are just trying to handle raising a teenager. I would definitely recommend this book to others, especially those looking for a book that can make them laugh, but also make them cry. After reading \\"The Fault In Our Stars\\" I have learned that most people take life for granted and that no one is promised tomorrow.
B00FN811SY|5.0|This app comes packed with information.  It has several Bible translations for comparison.  There are maps, charts and additional references to deepen you study.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|The movie seems to be a proxy for supporting WHO and the UN. If Brad Pitt wanted to make a political message, he should have made a documentary. But the movie itself is bearable.

B001DJLCRC|5.0|When I watched the 1st episode I was hooked, Breaking Bad is Bad.
B0014D6PCO|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It is quite inviting.  I recently acquired the other two Batman movies so I was able to watch all three in succession.  Thoroughly enjoyed the Trilogy!  A good mood silencer.  Will watch again sometime!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I really love the characters. A new twist on the Apocalyptic world. I plan on reading more. I think I am going to like this series.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|I have seen this movie so many times and I laugh so much every time, even knowing what is coming and it is still funny to me. I will continue to watch this movie again every few months.
B000V39KDO|4.0|Unique characters and an interesting story line. Everyone has six pack abs! Movie was well done and is an enjoyable action adventure film.
B00AO3K01C|3.0|The main character and narrator in this book,  troubled Japanese teenager Nao, is great: funny and desperate, credible and moving. Unfortunately the same does not apply to her counterpart, the blocked writer Ruth who finds her diary on the beach. If Ruth is an alter ego of the writer she didn't do herself a favour. Ruth is shallow and boring, and her husband the amateur know-all scientist is there just to give Ruth a counterpart. Nao's story is beautiful and would have been enough to make the book, but it is continuously interrupted by the Ruth parts and by all the mystery and supernatural elements and the confusing quantum physics explanations. While I loved the zen buddhism part, all the other concepts that the writer introduces are just too confusing. In this book, less would have been more.
B003SNJYSK|4.0|It took a while to get into this one. The backwards and forwards between time frames. Again a multi faceted and convoluted plot which does require some concentration, and you are wondering if the author will be able to bring it all together.<br /><br />But I do like Harry Hole, deeply flawed but a brilliant main character, which I enjoy. Well worth the read and definitely my favourite Scandinavian author.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game has pretty good graphics with a nice effect of gun shots hitting the animal. I enjoy playing it, as do all my friends.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|The landscapes are wonderful. Easy to find the objects . Will  invite friends to play. Going to fall in love with this game. Finally a hidden objects game that is fun and in enjoyable.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Great movie, great price. Very pleased. I pre-ordered it for less than at big chain stores. Plus the digital copy to boot.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wish they had another book.  Maybe with Katniss being elected president and her and Peeta living in the capital raising their children.  Making life in the district's better for everyone.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|A great chance for Marvel Comics fans to see many of their favorites in all of their CGI and high-tech splendor. A nicely woven blend of a Stan Lee type storyline and the wonderful personalities of the super heroes that we came to know and love.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Fast paced and full of action, but also a deeper story in regards to what is going on inside Katniss's mind in regards to Peeta and Gale.
B004BH0GUW|5.0|Simply a classic. Just like wedding singer, Billy Madison, and Happy Gilmore, this movie is hilarious. Adam is one of the funniest actors out there.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|There is no way of entering words. I am using a Samsung Galaxy Note 3.  Please fix so I can change my score.
B005LAIGLO|5.0|Its a good movie. If you're a fan of Mark Wahlberg, I suggest you see this one. I own almost all his movies, he's a great actor. and this film is simply entertaining.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Stumbled upon this book & really thought I messed up when I realized I was reading a high school girl's story. But wait!!! It's the best, most gripping story I've read in years!!! I had to call my husband immediately when I finished to bawl & share this incredible story! Colleen Hoover is now a new favorite author.
B00DW1WR14|2.0|I'm a long time fan but kind of gave up on the band after they released self titled. This album is a step in the right direction but still reminds me of the last two outings. Not sure why so many keep comparing it to Vitalogy and No Code. I don't hear it. This is far from \\"classic Pearl Jam\\". Ed's been singing the same way since S/T (at least on the rockers) and it doesn't really do the songs justice. The lyrics sound again uninspired. What happened to the clever wordplay? Ed seems to want to just cram as many words as possible into some songs at the expense of the melody. Last time I heard really good lyrics from the band was on Riot Act. I read reviews building the album up to be more experimental but it's mostly straight forward rockers and an overdose of ballads that sound very reminiscent of the last two albums. I'll keep listening to see if it's a grower but nothing jumps out at me right now. Getaway,Sirens, and Future Days are probably my favorites, but they are just okay. I don't see a lot of replay value. At least Backspacer had some fun singles.<br /><br />This is middle of the road Pearl Jam. And that's not a good place to be. The latter half of the album goes into territory that they've already done and done it better. The lived in quality from their back catalog is completely devoid here. It's just not convincing, even though some songs are pleasant such as Sleeping By Myself. Actually this song just sounds like a retread of \\"Soon Forget\\" from Binaural, only less interesting. I personally just can't get into the songs to see them through the entire thing before skipping. This is surprising since the band are great musicians but totally wasted here. Maybe I'm used to a different PJ but this one will take awhile. I do like the country vibe they are touching on in some songs. Future Days is probably the most different they have been in the last ten years.<br /><br />I'm hoping Pearl Jam returns to the sound they pioneered with albums like No Code, Binaural, and Riot Act with the next album or maybe go off in an acoustic direction. Maybe have Stone and Matt step up to the songwriting plate once again. Not sure why their contributions are so minor as of recent. Stone seems more interested in reading books than music these days.
B003G4W49C|5.0|My brother told me about this book awhile ago but wasn't interested in it until the movie was scheduled to come out. By far one of the best books I've read in awhile, I've also picked up the follow up book Speaker of the Dead. I'm going with this series even thou I have some catching up to do.
B00CDXOXB4|4.0|This is a pretty good movie for a chic flick. Josh Duhamel so hot right now and Julianne Hough is ok too.
B00FPH6M82|5.0|Incredible!  A great coming off age film, well presented and executed. It's refreshing to see good story line and plot driven themes again. Two thumbs up!
B00CHVIPP2|4.0|This is a great movie. The Blu-ray and dvd work fine. The digital copy is for UV. so it can be redeemed as a digital copy for ITunes, VUDU, or Flixter.<br />The only con that I have is that  I wish it worked for Amazon Prime.
B00005QAPH|4.0|\\"8 1/2\\" is Frederico Fellini's powerful statement about the desires we have and how they affect our lives. Fellini examines the question of how much we experience is real and what isn't real, but imagined in our heads. Fellini's film is very surrealistic, with beautiful images.<br /><br />Mastriani gives a fantastic performance as the protagonist of our story. He plays a film director, trying to keep his sanity as the film he's working on seems to be unraveling around him. What is really unraveling is his life, and the film includes some very funny scenes about the toll the labor is taking on him.<br /><br />Fellini makes it tough in my opinion to determine which scenes are occurring in real life and which scenes are all in the character's head. But I think that's the point, it's about discovering how easy our desires intersect with reality, and how we struggle to survive in the midst of the two.<br /><br />I think this film requires more than one viewing to understand everything that is going on. I think that will turn some viewers away because it can be a bit frustrating to watch this film the first time. But it's worth it, and I think it's one of the ten best films ever made.
B0000CFW87|2.0|MY NAME IS NOT LEE SIMMONS IT IS CHERI WEEKS.  GET THE NAMES OF THE PEOPLE THAT ORDER YOUR ALBUMS CORRECT.  I ORDERED THIS IN GOOD FAITH WITH THE HEADING 13 NEW SONGS.  BOY WAS I DISAPPOINTED THEY WERE ALL OLD SONGS FROM HIS OTHER ALBUMS.  REAL BUMMER.........
B000G8NXYG|5.0|Akira Kurosawa's \\"Seven Samurai\\" is a masterpiece in film making. I don't use that word lightly either, in this sense, because it's more than 50 years old but contains one of the greatest stories ever told in cinema. It's the story of how seven warriors agree to protect a village from bandits, and the struggles they go through to keep true to their word.<br /><br />The action scenes in this movie are very realistic looking. Kurosawa has a great ability to capture action in a way that doesn't look staged, how easy it is to watch action scenes in films that are poorly staged, or look fake. Seven Samurai's action scenes look brutal and real, and are choreographed beautifully.<br /><br />The performances are also superb, especially by Mifune, Kurosawa's regular. He's fantastic as the seventh warrior, and his character is developed very well by Kurosawa as the movie moves on. We learn he has a troubled past, and that he's got a very special bond with the children of the village.<br /><br />When watching this movie, I saw set pieces and scenes that have been copied by scores of directors. There's one scene in particular, when the young samurai warrior is asked to lie down and hide during a skirmish, that reminds you of the scene in Spielberg's \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" when Upham is ordered to hold back during an attack on a German machine gun. That's just one example of how this movie has influenced scores of directors and action movies. Arguably, it's the best film ever made.
B006FTCGXY|4.0|It was a little slow but I enjoyed the story and the possibility of the story.<br />Acting was excellent, but I don't think this is for every one.
B00DW1WR14|4.0|So if you like Pearl Jam, then I don't have to try to convince you to listen to this record. And if you're new to Pearl Jam, my advice is to NOT start with this record. But that doesn't mean don't come back to it. It's worth the listen.<br /><br />Pearl Jam's \\"Lightning Bolt\\" sounds like an experimental, free-range record with the band delving into some new sounds. \\"Pendulum\\" is a funky, unexpected sounding song that sounds to me like \\"Art House\\" Pearl Jam, trying to do something new. And I respect them a lot for that.<br /><br />\\"Let the Records Play\\" is a bluesy track that also has some rockabilly influences. It's a fun song, and the band's closer, \\"Future Days,\\" uses a violin and has a folksy, alternative country feel to it.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Lightning Bolt\\" represents an effort by this band, in my opinion, to dive into something new and offer the best kind of experimental effort it could. While this release won't please fans of the band who expect epic ballads or cardboard cutout hard rock tracks, it does present a new side to the band that I honestly wasn't expecting. I hope the band keeps putting out quality work in the future.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Excellent movie, excellent story line. Acting was A+. Matthew and the two boys were so much fun to watch. I would recommend this to all.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I bought two of these little gems.  I use them regularly with my iPad and Android tablets plus my Android smart phone.  I only gave it four stars because the app integration with Netflix and others could be a little cleaner.  If the iPad's starts to hibernate it's not very intuitive how to get back to the video you were watching.  Other than that I love this little device.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a great app for kids. I loved it . I love feeding and grooming my horse and I have alot of  money and gems
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|we really liked this movie, moved very well throughout and kept our attention.  Jodie Foster was great in this. Watch it!!!
B008JFUR10|1.0|The Ultraviolet digital version is a scam. You must have an active Ultraviolet acct and they claim that they may impose additional charges for access to your \\"locker\\" after one year. So basically you are NOT getting a digital copy for your digital library. You also cannot load it into your iTunes library. You are only \\"renting\\" access to a digital copy that is only accessible if you are online. This is useless without an Internet connection... even worse is watching it without WIFI will eat up your data minutes on your mobile device. Buyer beware!
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|This movie does a good job of bringing the novel to life. I liked the visuals and bright colors. The acting is good.
B008Y7J91M|4.0|I like period pieces and this one met my expectations.  If you like merry old England movies, you'll like this one.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Little slow pulling the details together but then it is great. Vivid details of the emotions make them feel real
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|I love adventure games.  I'll play the HOG, but this kind is my preference.  The graphics are beautiful, the music is soothing and not annoying.  It's not too hard, but I did use the hints twice.  First because I didn't realize what it was!  I thought it was a zoom in.  And once when I was truly lost.  Please, make more!  And longer?
B00BDSRKHO|5.0|OMD does not disappoint with its quirky sounds and melodies that stick in your mind. Looking forward to the next album.
B00BRUPICM|5.0|One of the best books I have read in the last year and I am now waiting for a sequel. There is quite a change in plot part way through the novel and the whole story keeps you turning the pages as fast as you can read.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Haven't watched more than a few minutes myself, but the wife is obsessed, says it's an interesting & very entertaining show.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Enjoyed every magical moment of Matthew and Diana's adventure! Looking forward to reading the remainder of the trilogy for a promising continued adventure!!
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|And it isn't about Neil Young. Not sure why it is up there.<br /><br />It is about Dave Grohl buying the Neve board from Sound City and still making records the old way and they are still sounding great.<br />It is about the interaction that made some of the greatest music of my time at the Sound City recording studio.<br />It is about 24 track  2 inch reel to reel at 30 IPS DBX.<br /><br />A must watch for the history alone.<br /><br />I would like to personally like to thank Dave Grohl for saving the console and his vision to revive analog recording.
B00CKKDZ2S|5.0|The advice offered is very peaceful, gentle, and yet, powerful!  It's also very accurate, addressing my exact situation at the time I draw the cards.  As for the card dealing with the future, it doesn't predict anything; instead, it gives advice that supports and expands on the advice from the two previous cards.  This is better than a prediction, because I don't think anyone can really predict the future anyway.  The card with the message for the day is also very accurate and helpful.  The background music, although repetitive, is very sweet and soothing.  I LOVE this app!!  It was very cheap to buy, and I'm SO glad I purchased it!!!
B000F7CMRM|5.0|This movie is a real cool flick!  Based on true events. Its a very intense movie! Everyone should have this with your collection!
B00821OX98|5.0|This is a great show! Season 2 was even better. Can't wait for season 3 to get on to Prime.
B003V1WTMM|5.0|Well crafted and beautifully written, I loved this story of three sisters whose lives are shaped by mental illness and tragedy in a beautiful Gothic castle.  Ms. Morton loves the technique of going back and forth in time and seeing things from the perspectives of the different characters, but this was textbook perfection in that technique, melding the lives and times together in such a way that keeps you on the edge of your seat right to the end.  Highly recommended.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|awesome game glad I found it wife was getting made aboutbuying cards at age 32 but found a good free way to play with out the nagging wife ynwim
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I was just introduced to the series from a friend over lunch.  That night, thanks to my Amazon Prime account, I started watching from Season 1, Episode 1.  I have been up late every night catching up.  Season 2 was even better than Season 1!  I highly recommend everyone get the series and start watching!
1416549447|5.0|I enjoyed the tips this book had to offer. It was a little difficult to master the technique in the beginning, but once I got it, running became more enjoyable.
B00EDLP6O2|5.0|Great boxing game. Buy it whether you like boxing or not. It has the best graphics ive seen yet. It's boxing up close and personal and it feels like you're really in a boxing ring. The control is perfect, it takes a little practice to learn. At only $.99, this game is a almost a give away because you get so much for so little.
B0064J6OMO|1.0|I could not get over the language I am 48yrs. old and I could not even watch 30 minutes there should be a warning that they have bad language in every sentence, F*** this and G. D. a sailor would blush
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. I loved everything about it.  I would read this book a million times and probably never get bored of it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love this book. It will make you cry and laugh and everything in between. Hazel and Augustus are such iconic characters that will always live in your heart.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This Game is so cool I love that you get to pick you name of your horse and you get to dress your horse to.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You feel like you need to stop but you cant because this game is AMAZING (like me) haha lol it's also a little educational more and more every time you update it cuz you're in different parts of the world and you understand their cultures
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I like the idea of the Chromecast, but it is so limited to just Netflix on my iPad. I can't find a way to pause it if i quit the Netflix app on accident and sometimes, the words and picture do not match up. It has great potential, but still needs a lot of fixes. I know a lot of apps aren't allowing this to be used because it would defeat their purpose, but I think it will do well in the long run. I wish you could use googleplay from your iPad and not just droid devices.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Love the story of this trilogy well written. Look forward to reading more from this Author. Loved Shades of Grey so knew I would enjoy these.
B000JVSUS4|4.0|One of my favorite movies.  Even better on blue-ray.  I would recommend this movie to anyone of all ages.  enjoy!!
0374533555|5.0|This is an excellent popular summary of the research on cognitive biases that won Kahneman a well-deserved Nobel.  Yes, it rambles on a bit too long, but I suspect that if we compared notes, we'd find that different people skimmed different bits, so maybe it's better for us to do the skimming based on our own interests than to have the author or editor try to guess which bits to cut and which hypothetical people to please.<br /><br />Kahneman does sometimes make it sound like everyone always makes the same mistakes.  Well, no.  For example, I took a college level probability course in my early teens, and my intuition on probability is usually pretty good, certainly much better than most.<br /><br />And I was amused by one of his examples of when we have to slow down and solve problems the slow brain way.  He gives a multiplication problem that can be solved at two glances, if not one, and then in the next paragraph he says it can't be solved by inspection and has to be solved using the old, slow multiplication algorithm.  (24 x 17 = ?  Well, 23 x 17 is 400 - 9, by the difference of squares rule, so 24 x 17 = 400 - 9 + 17 = 408.)  Yes, it's two steps, but it's still very simple mental arithmetic and it took all of about three seconds.  In spite of that, it IS an example of trained, \\"slow brain\\" reasoning, but Kahneman would have made the point much better if he had picked an example that was actually hard to do in your head.<br /><br />Even in the research results that he cites, there are always some people who don't make the typical error, and I would have liked more information about those people and how they differed from the rest.  It would be interesting to know, for example, if some formative experiences help make people better at resisting subtle influences and avoiding sloppy reasoning.  I mentioned one that happened to me, and I do think it would be worthwhile to see if a good intuitive introduction to probability early in life - say, 8th grade - would improve people's guesswork, or at least make them aware of how far wrong casual intuition can be.<br /><br />Excellent book, highly recommended!
B007PVHMCG|4.0|Box was much smaller than I thought it would be but my daughter likes them. Pieces are tiny so definitely not for small children
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this story. One I will recommend to any people for many different reasons: those going through challenging times, transitions, those dealing with loss... And those that just love camping and hiking!

0062124293|5.0|Ladies, put down \\"Lean In\\" and pick this book up lickety split. Sheryl Sandberg has nothing on Caitlin Moran, a one-woman feminist hurricane giving gals the 21st century manifesto we really need. This is a philosophy, not a prescription, and a brave, bold, hilarious, frank and ground-breaking one at that. Blasting bikini waxes, Botox and the pressure on women to have babies, Moran successfully argues for a new way of being a woman: stop judging, start doing. She even has the balls to talk about the time, as a married mother-of-two, she decided to have an abortion and why it was \\"the easiest thing she's ever done.\\" This book doesn't patronize, it provokes -- in the way a proper polemic truly should. Unlike Sandberg, who encourages you to \\"be nice to get ahead,\\" Moran doesn't care if you like her or not. She just wants to make you think (while laughing out loud). And because of that, I want to make her my personal guru for life.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|I loved reading this book to my preschoolers 25 years ago and now I am blessed to have three children of my own to enjoy it with for many years to come.
B000LB7G00|5.0|It is the best 3d mouse I have ever used.  I would highly recommend this to anyone that needs a 3D Mouse.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|A good movie with great actors.  I really liked how the action scenes are put together.  Great time watch it!
0792165020|5.0|Matt Damon is great in this movie!  He alone is worth watching.  Scenery, snobbish behavior, sex, suspense;  all there in spades!
B00AYLTMMM|4.0|This is a truly touching story with amazing performances from the cast. The priest was my favorite character :) Highly recommended for a night in!
B003G4W49C|5.0|They made a movie from this novel, and I want to see how far they stray from the content and characters
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|This was a great follow up album to Contra.  Love Obvious Bicycle and Unbelievers.  They are such a fun band!
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Sometimes it gives me a headache....there is a lot of choices if that is what you're looking for.  I guess I was just looking for bingo and not slot machines...among others.
B0091P6590|5.0|This movie has such an excellent cast. Its is simply entertaining to watch. The actors have this amazing ability to draw you in.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My 11 year old daughter loved reading this book and was totally engaged.  Can't beat that!  And I (mom) liked the book's message.  This book is a winner.
B00B6QXN56|2.0|It's no Clapton acoustic. But it's not real bad. I just think he's much better on electric. Live at royal Albert hall. The best.
B002UPQ246|4.0|Did not buy for self. But must be good. Because it's the 2nd time I bought this cd for person. Being that he lost first one
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book from start to finish.  I even enjoyed the extra little after the end.  Makes you think about how our lives can change from one event!
B0054LVP3Q|4.0|This was a good read, not particularly deep but not completely predictable like some mysteries. My opinion of who the villain might be kept changing and kept me reading.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have a lot of fun playing this game.  It is like a despicable me temple run! It is a must-have game.
B00ADQCBEY|3.0|I started watching it and wanted to know how the series first started, lots of violence if that is what you like.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|Game stinks when it comes to loading up, keeps stalling. Plus when it stalls it still uses my coins and points every time, so i have lost quite a few games played!!!!
B00F88H5K2|5.0|Michael Douglas and Matt Damon are both amazing in this movie. Quite a crazy life story of an amazing artist.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Though I'm happy that I didn't pay extra to see this in the theater, I do believe my time wasn't wasted in watching it. I liked the story and I like the twists. The visual was worth seeing. The concept was new to me.
B002ZG974M|5.0|It's babies. Really cute babies. No interviews, no dialogue, just babies. If that's not your thing, you've got the wrong movie.
B002QNTNL6|4.0|Liked it very much, watched for our family night everyone seemed to enjoy. The title was deceiving my sons didn't want to watch at first .
0802473156|5.0|This book was great. I didn't agree 100% with everything the author said - it is a little unrealistic to think people in this day and age will wait until they are married to be intimate... But it is full of lots of useful information. It clearly explains about our love tanks and what it takes to fill them. I think any couple, young or old, needs to read this book before getting married. It will help immensely in the long run.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Saw this at the theater and decided to buy a copy for home. It has been just as enjoyable watching at home as it was at the movies. Have never read the book and a lot of people who have did not like it. The movie is pretty similar but those that didn't like the book seem to like the movie more.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|Loved all the songs. Great CD!  I am still playing strong years later. Love the lead singers voice and all the songs stick in your head in a GOOD way! LOL
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|I was entertained from start to finishing with this book. I will be buying the other books in the series
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love logic games and this one is great. After doing the tutorial I went through the 5x5s easily. The 10x10s were a little more difficult but I flew through them too. Once I got to the 15x15s some are easy, but most are VERY challenging. The best thing is it only requires one permission. I would definitely recommend to anyone who loves logic puzzles.
B00D6UV172|5.0|It's Elvis all over but with the strong drum and bass thing going on it's bang up to date.<br />Highly recommended
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Pretty cool game with excellent graphics and special effects. This game is great for people of all ages and abilities.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|This app, is quite similar to  the other free one.  Sometimes it's a little harder to figure out, but still simple enough. This type of program just gives you a better view of what Wi-Fi's are around, and also more entertaining than what is on your Android device, but usually of not serious use, so what I like about this one, is that it can be moved to the SD card, and it does work on the Froyo version (and later) versions of Android.  This way I do have an entertaining informative app that isn't taking up valuable space.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Jaycee Dugard's experience was such a devastating thing to go through. Reading it from her perspective is very important because a lot of women go through the same feelings. They may not have been stolen from their families, but I do believe anyone who has been a victim of domestic violence can relate to her story!!! I believe women who are victims of domestic violence and years of abuse have had their life stolen from them as well.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I had been playing for a while, and was up to level 101, but I played Coin Dozer Seasons and when I started this game again, it threw me back to level 1!!  All prizes gone, all puzzles reset, I am not a happy camper...  Will take several weeks before I can get back to that level!  The website didn't have anything about a glitch like that!
B004SUDPXW|5.0|This is one of the best shows ever put on television. I am a big Sopranos fan. This show is right up there with it. Great writing and acting.
B000PC1JKS|5.0|This is a great CD. I love listening to Bob Marley. I will listen to it many times. Greatness !!!!
B0034CNSFU|4.0|I enjoy listening to this CD. There are better selections of his music. But you cannot go wrong with Hendrix.
B008Q07GLW|4.0|Worth watching again,they just don't make them like this any move. Newman and Redford worked well together, and this was proof.
B008Q08IV4|5.0|Tom Hanks, why not 5 stars! A great story and a fantastic cast, I'll watch over and over again I'm sure now that I have Amazon Prime.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|SORRY !! BUT I RECIEVED THE PACKAGE OPENED WITH NO CONTENTS. I FILED A COMPLAINT TO THE P.O. IN ST.LOUIS,MO.<br />ON OR ABOUT THE 1ST.OF OCT. SO FAR NO WORD FROM THEM YET. IF YOU COULD HELP IN SOME WAY I WOULD<br />APPRECIATE IT .<br />  THANKS ; ROBERT MOSER
1400069289|5.0|I have really enjoyed reading this book. It truly is an eye opener to the human dynamic and that of habit.
B008YRVW0I|2.0|Love match 3 games, plus little fishies in an aquarium, how great is that?  Well, I don't know because you don't get very far before you are stopped to purchase the actual game.  Did not know this was just a tiny tease of the actual game.  Love the graphics and how the game is played, but not enough to buy the full version when there are so many other free apps.
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|This was basically a movie about a guy sitting around looking at old video tapes and scaring himself.  Not much drama.  Not much suspense.  Not much of a story really. Not good.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|It was here the same week I ordered it. Works great not problems at all. Had it shipped the same day.
140006922X|2.0|Sketchy academic credentials aside, according to Aslan, because only seditionists were crucified, Jesus was a seditionist. No so. It is well documented that crucifixion was quite common in the ancient world. Although Roman law usually spared Roman citizens they routinely crucified rebellious foreigners, military prisoners, violent criminals, pirates, thieves, highwaymen, and disobedient slaves. In fact slaves were so routinely crucified that crucifixion become known in the Roman world as the slaves' punishment.<br /><br />So much for the &#34;crucifixion/sedition&#34; claim.<br /><br />Also, according to Aslan, in Leviticus 19:18, &#34;Forget about the wrong things people do to you, and do not try to get even. Love your neighbor as you love yourself,&#34; neighbor used means only ones fellow Jews. Well, if neighbor means only ones fellow Jews how do you explain the following a mere 14 verses later? &#34;When a foreigner resides among you in your land, do not mistreat them. The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt.&#34; (Leviticus 19: 33, 34)<br /><br />There is also this. &#34;For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, who shows no partiality and accepts no bribes. He defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow, and loves the foreigner residing among you, giving them food and clothing. And you are to love those who are foreigners, for you yourselves were foreigners in Egypt.&#34; (Deuteronomy 10: 17-19)<br /><br />So much for the &#34;neighbor meaning only one's fellow Jews&#34; assertion.<br /><br />IMO Jesus was a mystic, a Gnostic. The term &#34;gnostic&#34; derives from &#34;gnosis,&#34; which means &#34;knowledge&#34; in Greek. The Gnostics believed that they were privy to a secret knowledge about the divine. Jesus wasn't so naïve as to think that one could enter the Kingdom of Heaven merely by kicking out the Romans. Sure, there was no distinction between church and state in those days but can deep human suffering and alienation from the Creator be cured by political means? Can peace, true peace and harmony be achieved by simply signing a treaty? No, Jesus was looking somewhere else. He said that the Kingdom of Heaven was within. He spoke of sowing seeds and a pearl of great price. Does that sound political?<br /><br />The Messiah expected in the Old Testament was a military leader who would drive out foreign invaders. This Messiah was not a savior of individual souls but the savior of the nation of Israel. The New Testament Messiah, Jesus of Nazareth, was a rabbi, a teacher, not a military leader. The Kingdom of Heaven He spoke of was NOT a renewed Israel free of Roman occupation. It was NOT a physical location but rather a state of consciousness one could enter if one repented, made right with God, and surrendered to the Holy Spirit. Certainly political uprisings did occur in the decades before and after the events in the New Testament but nowhere does Jesus or his predecessor John the Baptist speak in political, territorial or military terms. The devil Jesus confronted in the desert was an inner one, He spoke of the mystery of the kingdom of God.<br /><br />&#34;And he said to them, To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but to them that are without, all these things are done in parables:&#34; ~ Mark 4:11<br /><br />&#34;Blessed are the meek (gentle), for they will inherit the earth.&#34; ~ Matthew 5:5<br /><br />&#34;And he answered them, “To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given.&#34; ~ Matthew 13:11<br /><br />&#34;You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.&#34; ~ Matthew 5:43-48<br /><br />Then said Jesus unto him, “Put up again your sword into its place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.” ~ Matthew 26:52<br /><br />&#34;For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?&#34; (Mark 8:36)<br /><br />Jesus answered him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.” John 3:3<br /><br />Jesus said, “My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jewish leaders. But now my kingdom is from another place.” ~ John 18:36<br /><br />&#34;But we impart a secret and hidden wisdom of God, which God decreed before the ages for our glory” ~ 1 Corinthians 2:7<br /><br />So Jesus was no Che Guevara or Osama Bin laden. The message He left behind which has lasted 2000 years is a spiritual one. If you want to find out more about the message and mission of Jesus I recommend [[ASIN:1496033043 For Christ's Sake: pressing the refresh button on the life of Jesus]] by Glenville Whittaker and [[The Fourth Gospel: Tales of a Jewish Mystic]] by Bishop John Shelby Spong.d.” ~ Matthew 26:52<br /><br />&#34;For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?&#34; (Mark 8:36)<br /><br />Jesus answered him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.” John 3:3<br /><br />Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free. ~ John 8:32<br /><br />Jesus said, “My kingdom is not of this world.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|The book is not only fascinating, it is quite well written.  It is well documented and methodically organized.  If you don't find it thought provoking, you are not paying attention.
1401201911|5.0|Loved the book. DC's Elseworlds style stories are some of my favorites. Plus, I love Batman's costume, especially the hat.
B0042J6VUS|3.0|I knew this might be cheaply made by the price. it worked great with my galaxy s3 when the case was off of it. but it broke after just a few uses.
B008602KQI|4.0|This movie I bought to add 2 my personal collection!!!! It was at a good price & got to me on time!!!! Very very happy
B00D2ZF3GQ|5.0|I was blown away excellent movie, good for kids the whole family. Would not let the little ones watch wild animals may frighten them.
B0000640VN|4.0|I am very satisfied with the promptness of receiving my order, i did think the shipping charges were a bit high;<br />nevertheless the items I ordered were all in good shape. I ordered the Valley of Light for a gift so that remains<br />to be opened.  Thanks Amazon for such a good job, Nita
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is the best i played it.. but i accidentally deleted so i redownloaded it and it ,had more cool stuff so i got all the cars,all the tracks and by the way this game is the best game ever
B00280LYIC|5.0|Nothing like the movie so much better I love it so great right now just trying to finish my words but still good
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Another interesting game, use your mind to figure out how to connect . Makes you want to get all stars in levels. Fun for all ages . I would recommend this game  as a way to pass the time.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is also a great game if you like escape games. With a little thought you can usually figure it out, only downside is<br />There is not alot of levels.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Another great escape game, you'll not want to put it down. Hints are provided if you need them to help you along but usually you can figure it out. One con is there is not enough levels , can't wait for next chapter to come out.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|When is the update coming out with beach and hover craft my dad has it on his I phone pretty sick game.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Love it! We're Star Trek fans going back to the 60's and love the attention paid to original characters. Won't say anything more so as not to spoil, but if you liked the old series and original movies think you're going to really like it!
B00EPZEU70|5.0|This is a very nicely made instant camera. It just like the Polaroids of years past and made just like their higher-end products. This camera is made of very high grade materials as opposed to the much cheaper plastic models of this of the mini instax. I believe that Fuji used a higher grade lens as the photos are sharper and the colors are rendered much better to my eye.<br /><br />The instax film is very fast developing with beautiful colors. Both Fuji and Polaroid long ago had perfected this product -  beautiful colors.<br /><br />Kids today are fascinated with these instant developing cameras - my grandson loves his digitals but there is a little bit of magic in the instant photograph!!!<br /><br />I bought mine from a Amz merchant in Japan --shipped quickly and had it in 3 days after shipped<br /><br />Lots of fun!!.<br /><br />The A/C battery charger works perfectly in the USA no adapter needed.
B00CNQ7CRI|1.0|When the original Bridget Jones novel came out, gossip said it had been ghost-written.  The same rumors swirled around the second book:  that Helen Fielding hadn't really written it.  I never paid much attention to them until I picked up Mad About the Boy, but now I wonder if they had indeed been true all along.  This book doesn't seem to have been written by the same person.  The humor is gone; the inimitable Bridget Jones voice and personality are gone; the diary format has fallen apart, wandering from attempts at the terse play-by-play style of the original to rambling memoir and attempts at description; and the author can't seem to decide whether she's writing in past or present tense.  The daily totals, which used to tell Bridget's life in microcosm, read like a feeble imitation.  At the start of the book we hear about lice, and then we move into vomit and diarrhea (and the REAL Bridget, wherever she is, would have made it funny), and it doesn't get better from there, just more confusing.  This isn't plotting, this is plodding.<br /><br />The original Bridget Jones spawned a literary genre.  This one just spawns a yawn.  Read it if you're curious; I did - but you'll probably be happier checking it out of the library than paying actual money for it.
B00CHMBQ0C|3.0|I saw this movie as a free offering on my Xbox. I enjoyed the movie as a little above average flick with decent, not stellar acting. Did I enjoy it ?  Sure, but The Bourne Identity is a better action flick. The story has a couple of decent twists, but Kevin Costner's No Way Out has better twists. I'll watch it when it comes on the cable, but probably won't buy the DVD until it hits the $5 barrel at Wal-Mart, but I probably will then. It's a good airplane movie for a short flight.
B00007GZR5|1.0|The DVD I received contained a 19th century rubber stamp \\"Made in Mexico\\" on the back?? Thanks for selling me a poor quality bootleg.
1612680011|1.0|Read this on a long day on a plane. At the end there were a couple of good points. But really felt like the good stuff could have been said in 10 pages or less. Guessing there are much better books on pretty much all of this. A couple of his libertarian comments were laugh out loud absurd. Really reminded me just how out of touch libertarians are.
0194799042|4.0|The dictionary is excellent. I didn't give five stars because the letters are too small. The paper is too thin letting a little shadow of the highlighted text transpass the other side of the page. I will forgive a little the editors because the book is big almost 2000 pages and any effort to make a better book  would turn it much bigger. Fortunately they say everything is on the CD-ROM. Let us check it out.
0399159347|5.0|I loved this book. It was entertaining and surprising, I couldn't guess what the secret was and even after it was revealed, there were more surprises to come. I would definitely recommend this book.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Love the book and can't wait for the movie. I would recommend to anyone interested in this genre. Am going to read it again
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Before, I would have given this app three stars. it's better than the FB &quot;app&quot; that comes on the Kindle Fire, a.k.a. a link to FB mobile. Overall functional. But it was definitely buggy. For instance, I would type a comment and when I hit the button to submit it, sometimes it would just close the comments window and go back to my feed without posting the comment, as if I had just tapped outside the window. Or my favorite, it wouldn't let me type words if they were the beginning of someone's first or last name, it would think I was trying to tag them. But then instead of tagging them when I hit the space button, it would just delete the word entirely. very frustrating to have a friend whose last name starts with &quot;good.&quot; And the tagging mechanism is clumsy even when you try to use it on purpose.<br /><br />But now, the update just bricks the whole app. When I try to load it, it goes to the blue loading splash, and then crashes. Every time. So really it deserves only one star now, but I don't want to be a total jerk because I know at least what the app COULD be like.
0316074314|5.0|Originally composed 10/13/13 on goodreads.com<br /><br />The Luminaries is, I think, a historic literary achievement. If it doesn't win this year's Man Booker Prize, you'll be able to knock me over with a feather. Yeah, that's the most polite way to put it. I cannot wait to read this novel again. It's a pleasure to read, and it bears substantial scholarly scrutiny as a work of literary art.<br /><br />I've commended novelists for their ambition in some of my previous reviews. Eleanor Catton's ambition is revealed first by the somewhat abstract astrological structure she sets up for her work -- it's the kind of move a book meant merely to entertain does not dare. It reminds me somewhat of James Joyce's modeling his masterwork about June 16th in the life of Dedalus and Bloom, Ulysses, after Homer's Odyssey. While Catton's pretense does not match that of Joyce, her execution of her work places it squarely within the same tradition of masterful examples of the novel.<br /><br />Also, as a sidenote, I found that some of Catton's prose reminded me of Joyce's in the penultimate catechism-type episode in Ulysses. I did not do a close side-by-side comparison, but that was the impression that jumped to the front of my mind as I read. In its scope and achievement, this work also calls to mind George Eliot's Middlemarch.<br /><br />To speak more of The Luminaries on its own terms, as really I ought:<br />--There's poetry in this prose; it's everywhere evocative.<br />--The narrative voice is free and easy; Catton doesn't give the sense that she's trying too hard. To write such a complex and masterful work so confidently blows my mind. If I were to characterize her narrative style altogether in a few words I would choose: playful, with an affectionate disposition to reader and the narrative itself.<br />--Like other great novels I've mentioned in this review, it unites macroscopic and microscopic views of its subject matter and does so in a circumscribed setting in terms of time and place. This focuses the range of detail and ultimately epic effect of the work.<br /><br />The Luminaries is resplendent; you won't want to miss it, dear readers. All you English majors, dust off your rigorous analytical skills, and all you lovers of literature, dust off that part of your heart that feels great books. Some classic literature is happenin' here!<br /><br />I hope this helps; thanks for reading my ideas.

1250038820|5.0|I have never reviewed a book before, but I had to for Humans of New York. I've been looking forward to this book for MONTHS, and had pre-ordered it - and it's even more amazing, inspiring, and heartrendingly beautiful than I even imagined. It's a treasure. I look forward to Brandon's posts on Facebook every day; they make me feel hopeful, and connected to humankind. This isn't so much Humans of New York as it is just HUMANS. As a professional portrait photographer, I adore the beauty of the photographs; each one tells a story in itself, and then the interviews dig deeper. I love the FB page and the blog, but seeing the photos in print and being able to flip through the pages is even better.<br /><br />Now that I own it, I will be buying one as a holiday gift for all the special people on my list so they can experience this magic too.  I really hope that there will be another Humans of New York book soon! And please - BOOK TOUR!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This application comes in handy. The layout is simple. The colors and size of the buttons are easy on my eyes. It works well. I have not had any problems with it.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|This was a fantastic book. Not only was it an easily to comprehend book, but also very engaging.  The author looks at Jesus as a man, not as divine, and it is truly interesting to look at him in that light.  Especially because, as you come to know, he was hardly the first during that time to call himself the Messiah.  One of the better religious texts I've read in a long time. I highly recommend if Religious Non-Fic is for you.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Always an awesome album, it's too bad you can't purchase this album in mp3 form. Really enjoy listening to this album some songs are kind of redundant but that's Tool for yuh.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|The quality of the video is amazing. I played youtube in Chrome browser from a windows laptop onto the TV.<br />One problem, a major one, is that if you are in a hotel where you connect to internet via  browser (by giving guest user id and password and by accepting the terms and conditions) as against just giving the password (WPA Security key) on your home router, the Chromecast doesn't work.<br />The Chromecast doesn't give you an option where you can enter the guest user id and password on a browser page. It always expects that you are connecting to a 'home' type of router and asks just for the router password.<br />This is a major disappointment.
B001D7T6CM|5.0|Really just wanted Devil in a Blue Dress, to watch every few years,<br /><br />The other was OK but creepy, only one viewing for me.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Its good. Semi difficult good mind puzzle. Does only have ten levels but more to come, or so it says
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|Love the fact that I can also watch this movie on my ipad after purchasing the DVD. Thanks Amazon, you are the best!
B008476HBM|5.0|I loved this story from the start and truly hated to see it end. No matter how many times you read it you cannot help but become involved, fall in love with the characters and root for Darcy and Elizabeth.
B00FHSQKZ4|5.0|Very good app - it is exactly what i was searching for! Do not need to interrupt myself while learning to check a time!!
1781162646|5.0|Short quick exciting read. Well done as all his books are. Would highly recommmend to anyone, even non-King fans, crazy as that might be
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Such a shame this show was canceled after the first season.  It is really a great mixture of Sci-Fi and Western.
1476727651|5.0|Im not even finished as I write this, but this is one of Kings best books. I love them all so thats saying something
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I loved this book. I liked the writing style going between to main characters. It good look into the past
B003XVYLDU|5.0|It's very readable with colorful images and reflects the follies of the human race.  Written decades ago, but it is still hits home today.  It has many very quotable passages.
B002JIBA8W|1.0|... I just wish that I could have seen the end. Although it downloaded, I couldn't watch past 1:37. I reached out to Amazon, but haven't heard back. The process for reporting streaming/downloading problems isn't very user friendly/existent.<br /><br />I guess I'll never know if the Panthers win.
B008BF9ZFM|3.0|The idea to have a rhyming story for kids is good and the subject of a fishing contest is great, however, I found it difficult to get into the rhythm of the rhyme.<br />More sketches, in the style of the cover, interspersed through the story, would enhance its appeal.
B004XZR63M|5.0|This Book is everything that the word Amazing intends to describe. I strongly recommend this book to anyone that really wants to take their potential to another level.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|This series of &#34;The Tudors&#34; is one that I would recommend to all my friends and family.  It is so entertaining and educational.  I will watch this over and over again for the next few years.  Well worth the money I paid to get it!!!!
B0000VCZKW|5.0|LOVE THIS MOVIE. I BOUGHT ONE FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER AND HAD TO BUY ANOTHERONE FOR MYSELF. MATILDAIS AN ADORABLE LITTLE GIRL.
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|what a fantastic cd. I loved the music on it so so much. wow I cant believe how good it was. wow
B000FCKIFU|4.0|This is a good story, and somehow the almost superhuman abilities of the lead charecter come off as believable.  The entire series really kept me hooked, I would recommend this to anybody!
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|what a fantastic cd. I loved the music on it so so much. wow I cant believe how good it was. wow
B00F880BWG|5.0|It's the Walking Dead, how could you not give this five stars, every season has been great, and I don't expect this one to be any different.
1480539643|5.0|what a great story. I loved it so so much. What a love story. I want more please. hurry..... great
B000FC2PKG|3.0|I enjoyed this book, but even just now I had to remind myself what is was about. It's a good story, but nothing really stands out about it.
B004J4WNL2|1.0|This book is too research oriented to be an interesting read. I tried to skip all the boring parts but there were too many. I am a closet introvert and was anxious to read this. Disappointed that I paid for it.
B005LLSNNE|4.0|Sons of Anarchy is past its prime when it comes to good original content, but it still is something to look forward too every week.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I enjoyed this book. Wish I had read, &#34;The Shining&#34; first but went backwards and reading it now. First Stephen King novel and I think I am hooked.
B000MRAAJW|3.0|HEY, this is the HD DVD version of Planet Earth.  It's not that Planet Earth is bad, it's just that Blu-ray 'won' the battle of the HD formats and we lost.  Remember VHS vs. Betamax.  This is the Betamas of HD viewing.
B00B8R1NP0|3.0|This was a book that was easy and fast to read. A neat who done it. I enjoyed it very much
039916409X|5.0|I'm half way through the book and have used much of the amazing content toward my own EFT practice as a practitioner already.  I am currently enrolled in Margaret Lynches coaching program and highly recommend her to anyone looking to take their personal and business life to the next level!
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app makes it fun and easy to use pinterest! It's as simple as that :) It works very well on my kindle and gives me complete access to all of my pinterest stuff on my mobile device. No complaints.
1439192812|5.0|I am a fan of Richard Dawkins logical scientific views of the world, and in this book he try to have you realize that reality is just as amazing, magical and bizarre as any myth or superstition.
1400034205|2.0|I was seriously disappointed with Razor's Edge. It's nothing more than a curiosity - a novel so journalistic in style and therefore almost laughable it has no value to anyone but a lit major. This is not great literature. It's an absurd story written in a time before psychology that focuses on human motivation with what we today see as nonsense. Despite the reality of the time, if indeed it is reality, it's impossible to read a novel in which everybody says \\"Golly!\\" and \\"Gosh!\\" every few pages. In private conversation between men, nobody even says \\"Damn it\\" let alone \\"Shit!\\". The central character, an essentially celibate seeker of what he knows not what, is nothing more than idiocy. Why two movies have been made of this junk I have no idea, but if somebody made it again with Will Ferrell saying Gosh and Golly and telling women thanks, but no, it would be hysterical. In fact, here's my cast: Ferrell as Larry, Bill Nighy as Elliot, Bill Murray as Somerset Maugham, Sarah Silverman as Isabel, and Zach Galafinakis as Gray.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I love comic books, I grew up with an older cousin who always brought me to the store. I have now carried this on with my two boys, who also are super hero fans, as most young children are. I gave this 5 stars because of all of the characters and the fact that it is super entertaining for myself and my boys.
0810994739|5.0|My daughter absolutely loves this series.  The book came in perfect condition and the shipping was fast and earlier than it said.  This is more of a fun book for children and makes it fun to keep them reading.  Thank you!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I enjoyed this book as much as the others. The fact that it was actually a long book and I finished relatively quickly is a testament to how good it was.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|Thanks to a coworker who told me to read this to my class. This book is a great discussion for a group of kids.
B00EK0UBPU|5.0|Excellent read, love historical novels, being a New Zealander with knowledge of Hokitika she has really nailed this town.  Eleanor has just won the Man Booker prize and is the youngest author to win.  Would highly recommend this.
B0035JNTA6|3.0|Stiller plays a character that made my skin crawl, in a laughable way.  Some good laughs which is what I was looking for.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love this game alot. I think it is good for all ages. Its really fun. I recommend it to anyone.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I knew I was getting Star Trek TOS, but this is awesome.  The quality is excellent and the extras are worth it.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|.<br />. love all of it:-) .  The only thing I don't like is the time. It's mabay one min but it's okay..
B00DURILJ2|3.0|I was actually disappointed with this film. It was more about the young boys and should have been named after them than MM.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Prepare to cry while watching this one.  Beautiful story.  The dog is so wonderful that he became the &#34;star&#34; -- and I am an avid Richard Gere fan.  The back story behind the making of the movie is very touching as well.  All animal/pet lovers should enjoy this, but I repeat . . . prepare to cry.
B0026NBZDU|5.0|This book was recommended because I loved &#34;Gone Girl.&#34; This book had so many twists and turns I found myself laughing out loud at the irony that was bestowed on each character. The main characters are portrait deeply, but the protagonist and the antagonistic change roles several times in the book.<br />I don't usually read books twice (because there too much out there I want to read!) but this book will be an exception. I want to go back to see if there were any clues I missed.<br />Well written!
0345525558|3.0|I started out disliking this book but had to slog through it for my book club. By the end, to my surprise, I liked it.<br /><br />Here is my advice if you decide to read the book:<br /><br />1. Flower references are in the back of the book, if you are interested.<br />2. Suspend disbelief: there are some contrived plot turns, but just go with it.<br />3. Try to forgive Victoria the way the main characters in her life do, otherwise she will irritate the heck out of you.<br />4. Never mind the location, just go with the story.  I can't believe the author was born in San Francisco.  Her description of the climate seemed more similar to Florida.<br /><br />I found the writing at the beginning clunky.  Several times I had to reread sections, thinking I had missed something.  I hadn't, it was just jumpy/clunky writing.  By the end I was speed reading, skipping over the confusing writing style and the flowers.<br /><br />The flower symbolism thing was a mildly interesting way to tell the story, but it got tiresome.  It seemed a little ridiculous at times.<br /><br />The story of foster kids was very interesting.  I wish that had been explored in more depth, but the book would have been too long.  That part of the story made me want to go out and find some kids to foster and love.  It was sad.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I recently lost my father and after reading this book I actually felt very good about where he is at.  After reading this book the pain I have felt is definitely less.
0061438294|2.0|After having read some of David J. Lieberman's books like Never Be Lied To Again and Get Anyone To Do Anything I heard Joe Navarro's book was much better.  It is not.<br /><br />Most of the knowledge Mr. Navarro dispenses is just common sense stuff you knew even as a child.  An example would be the picture on pg.82 where the woman is grasping at the arms of her chair while having her legs wrapped around the legs of the chair with a scared look on her face.  The caption says the woman has discomfort, anxiety, or concern.  Really???  Thanks for imparting that knowledge upon us Mr. Navarro.<br /><br />It is also explained that everyone is different so you must calibrate each individual separately from earlier questioning to see what each person's unique response is to different feelings they are experiencing while being questioned.  So why write the book on reading people if everyone is different???<br /><br />There are good books on reading people but this is not one of them.  If this is what our society uses to interrogate criminals half of the people in prison are probably innocent.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This is a really cool book that gives lots of humor filled advice along with some great experimenter to prove to yourself once and for all the power of the Universe.  I highly recommend this book if you are a beginner or some what experienced in the field of energy....something here for everyone!
B0007Y08QA|3.0|A pretty decent dark movie.  Christian Bale went a little overboard preparing for this movie though.  As a method actor Bale likes to really become the character not just act like the character he is portraying.  In the movie the character hasn't slept well if at all for a year and didn't eat hardly anything either.  Bale could have cut off the diet about 30lbs. earlier and still would have been convincing in the role.<br /><br />This movie seems to be a classic to some people and that's why I purchased the dvd.  It was a good movie to watch with a neat ending but I wouldn't say there is anything great about it.  I like Bale's movies but American Psycho is much better.  I hope Bale didn't get too much into that character!!!
B000059T1V|5.0|Muddy Waters at Newport 1960 is great old school jazz. I love this CD and have listened to it many times.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Who doesn't love the minions. They steal the show. A great movie with humor and heart. Can't wait to see the 2nd movie again now.
B00139XTG4|2.0|Lots of mobo jombo not much of concrete substance.<br />Spread conversation not focused.<br />Scientifically not challenging.<br />Must be revised to add substance.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Purchased this device a few weeks ago.  Goal was to find an economic (in time and $$)  way to wirelessly stream movies and websites from my laptop to my TV without purchasing a separate netbox computer and mess with all the ancillary issues of maintaining a separate computer.  Researched Roku, AppleTV, etc. but they lacked the ability to stream from my computer to the TV whatever I was looking at on the screen.<br /><br />The Chromecast met those goals.  I won't describe the full mechanics of how it works -- there are tons of product reviews/tech sites that explain that -- but I will say that this devices works really well and is dead easy to use.  It is small, quick to set up, doesn't require a technical degree to figure out and does what it says it will do. You control playback from your computer so no additional remotes to pile on the coffee table. It comes populated with Netflix and YouTube and a music channel (have not played with music channel) and one thing I REALLY like is that I can start a movie or video on my computer and send it over to the TV -- &#34;Cast&#34; it --- and the device then takes it from there -- streams the video from the network --- thus allowing me to continue surfing on the web while the movie is playing. It will even turn on your TV for you when you cast to it.  I can minimize the cast tab and continue to work on other browser tabs and even in different browsers.  The Chromecast requires that you use the Chrome browser for casting.  I am a IE user.  So I kick off whatever I'm watching in Chrome and then go back over to IE to surf and work.<br /><br />The movies and videos from Netflix and YouTube playback in HD.  If you are playing a video that is streaming directly from a website (embedded in the webpage) the playback will be in whatever quality that is on the webpage, and can be a bit choppy and get out of sync with video/audio.  I'm guessing this is b/c it is streaming from the website to your computer, then streaming to the Chromecast device instead of streaming directly to the Chromecast as with the native channels on the device.  However, if I stop and then start up the video again it seems to sync up and be fine.  I should also point out that I am using this on a DSL 3MB internet connection and have no issues with buffering, interrupted playback, pixilating, etc.on the Netflix/YouTube playback.  A faster internet speed might resolve the webpage issues.<br /><br />Wishes:  I would like more native channels on the device for PC.  Google announced a HuluPlus addition but seems to be for phones and pad devices .  They are promising more channels but have not seen much so far.  I am moving towards cutting the cable TV subscription entirely and have already reduced down to a minimal level for local channels.  And in that vein, I may revisit purchasing a Roku to compliment the Chromecast.<br /><br />Bottom line:  I really like this device.  And for a low startup cost -- $35 --- it was a good gamble to see how well it would work with my home set up and meet my goals.  Am looking forward to seeing how Google grows and adds to its capabilities.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This was a really entertaining, lovely story. I think it tries to take an honest approach on how cancer might affect a family, but the portrayal of teenage love was not so believable. Like many reviewers have mentioned these kids aren't very &#34;teenager-y&#34; in the was they talk and interact, perhaps it's to show how their disease has made them grow up but I don't think it's realistic. People are often made to believe that love is full of grand romantic gestures, but it's not. Regardless of some of the over the top aspects you do feel for the characters - I barely put it down and would still recommend it.
B004LWZW7Y|1.0|Not really recommended for children younger than six or seven years old. Not happy I got it for my three year old boy.
B00821OX98|5.0|Didn't know exactly what to expect with this show when I started, but it pulled me in. Comparable to The Walking Dead as far as story telling episode to episode.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|I downloaded this App and cannot stop playing it.  It is very easy to use,and a lot of fun to play.
B00BTHV05M|5.0|I thoroughly love this music.  Counting Stars, along with all of the songs really, have lyrics that are so expressive and smart.  Ryan Tedder is a wordsmith in my opinion. I love the intricate way he weaves lyrics together that can have so many different meanings.  It can really hold for an audience of whatever age and life experience level.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It's a cool game I play all the time you should toats get it cuz like it's fun ps yes I'm a teenage girl deal with it :)
B005544TRQ|5.0|A fun show. I enjoyed it and am looking forward to future seasons. Makes for a relaxing evenings entertainment. Bring the popcorn.
B00B52F278|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the entire series of Spartacus. It was quite different than the original, with Kirk Douglas. Got pretty violent and the nude and sex scenes , were a little disturbing. That part did not keep me from enjoying every minute of the series.
B00ARHAAZ6|3.0|Steelheart was an audiobook read. I have to point out that MacLeod Andrews is a phenomenal narrator! I am definitely going to have to see what else he has narrated that might be a good read for me.<br />In my very odd yet honest opinion this synopsis in no way represents that this is a Young Adult Sci Fi. For me there was much disappointment in that I thought I had one thing when in all actuality I had another, not a pleasant surprise. Nothing denotes this title to be YA. Steelheart is intended for a younger audience. There are many reasons that I stay away from the entire young adult genre and they are all displayed inside this book.<br />Brandon Sanderson has created a very intriguing world with his Reckoners. Set in a future where select humans have been granted super abilities that they abuse for the sole benefit of themselves normal humans struggle to just to survive another day in their bleak existence. There is enough intrigue surrounding the Epics and Calamity that the story moves at a constant steady pace. The action is plentiful and exhilarating. The changes in the world that we know are believable to the world this story is set in.<br />David is the young teen hero. He has spent his short life studying and gathering as much information on the Epics that he could. He collected this info no matter how significant or insignificant that it seemed. He wants his revenge and will do anything to get it. He wants to see Steelheart brought down and he knows that with the assistance of the Reckoners he can see this happen. Far too many times David puts the entire team in danger and the adults stand by and let him make the foolish decisions that put them all in danger.<br />Please keep in mind there is nothing wrong with Steelheart. In fact if you go into this book expecting a quirky young hero still in his teens to save the day then you will love this book. My dislike of young adult and my lack of suspending enough disbelief that a teen can save the day are my own personal issues with the book. If you enjoy sci fi and young adult you will love this book!ersonal issues with the book. If you enjoy sci fi and young adult you will love this book!
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|The fact that Brian “Head” Welch is back with the band is so awesome! The music rocks the true sound of Korn that I love. The DVD documentary of the reconciliation Rocks!!! I love this CD!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Good game to help past the time on a military deployment. I like to challenge the other guys to see who has the best score.
0316074314|2.0|This is everything a book shouldn't be. Cold. Contrived. Tedious. Dishonest. From the first chapter, the obvious symbolism (12 men in a room = 12 signs of the zodiac - yawn...) and constant telling (SHOW us who your characters are, don't TELL us) grates. Delving into Victorian era literary convention obviously makes great book prize fodder, but it's not such an entertaining (or illuminating) experience for the reader (there's a reason writing styles have evolved!).<br /><br />All in all, the contrived structure and forced symbolism makes this novel the literary equivalent of a paint-by-numbers colouring book (basically, she wrote a story to fit her preordained structure and symbolism. This is pretension of the worst kind, and once you read the book, you'll also recognise the inherent irony in this).<br /><br />Also, why would the author make the 12 signs of the zodiac such an integral part of the book, when many of these constellations look totally different (foreign) in New Zealand? This is a slavish adoption of Northern Hemisphere astrological tradition (it's like an English writer setting his story in Norfolk, but weaving everything around Maori astrological traditions). The lack of a link between the story and the astrological device (or any discernible purpose for it) is already the novel's weakest aspect (rendering it nothing more than a poorly constructed gimmick), and this further undermines it for me. Catton also explained that she developed her characters from the theme down to the individual - thus Virgo, notoriously hard-working, is a Chinese gold prospector. Yes, those hardworking little Chinese worker ants. Because it's POSITIVE racism, innit gov? Such worldly insights, such deft characterisation...<br /><br />Big negative - unless you've got an epic or sprawling story underpin (which this book hasn't), it's not an accomplishment to fill 800 pages. Good writing is an exercise in brevity. As Shakespeare put it, 'brevity is the soul of wit'. The last 200pages, for example, could have been omitted en masse.<br /><br />Some of the dialogue also doesn't ring true. For example, one character (described as having a `cultivated air') nonchalantly refers to a female character as a `wh*re'. After endless paragraphs of painfully stilted Victorian reserve, the word is so jarring (and unbelievable) that it completely pulls you out of the story. He might as well have flipped open an Apple iphone.<br /><br />So what's the future of publishing if a book like this wins the Booker? A gimmicky, book prize baiting construction that's less than the sum of its parts, and devoid of any true depth or heft? The books of authors like Hemingway, Kerouac, Miller etc. reflect a rich, vivid, AUTHENTIC life experience and insight. What's this writer's background? According to interviews, her favourite pastime is watching TV box sets...<br /><br />In summary - a true storyteller operates like a magician - you don't notice the little man tugging on the ropes behind the curtains. A true storyteller makes you forget that you're reading a work of fiction. But this writer is desperately trying to show her audience how clever she is. Forcing the issue, though, reveals she's not.<br /><br />PS - I'm reminded of Dr. Samuel Johnson's advice (quoting from a college tutor's advice to his pupils) - 'Read over your compositions, and wherever you meet with a passage which you think is particularly fine, strike it out'. Good writing doesn't require convoluted styles, overwriting or contrived devices - just the honest truth, faithfully observed and imaginatively conveyed. Catton has all the tools of a good writer, she just hasn't got anything to say (yet), or sufficient insight (yet) to create prose with depth, resonance or substance.<br /><br />PPS - (In answer to a comment): The question is - does the artificial construct add to, or subtract from, the book? Most reviewers of The Luminaries (even the positive ones) seem to gloss over (or even worse - ignore)the astrological set-up. In fact, there appears to be widespread consensus that it would probably be a better book without it. The intrusion of the author's voice isn't always unwelcome; if it's done well, it becomes an additional character and a seamless part of the story. If it's executed poorly, however, it remains a visible distraction, serving no purpose.
B007UXTG8M|5.0|At last a movie that is not afraid to portray on screen life as it can be.  Great acting.  Kudos to Michael  Fassbender and Carey Mulligan.
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|This film shows how Pope John Paul II was formed into the man he would become by going through World War II and the death of all his beloved family members.
B000MNP2K8|5.0|I owned this movie before bur seem to have lost it. So was glad to be able to get it again.
B00E38KGF4|5.0|It's hard to know if an application is doing what it's supposed to be doing in the background. This one let's me know it's there and running. With each new download, it confirms the safety of the data being introduced to my Kindle Fire. I can't speak to its accuracy or the extent and range of known threats and problems nor do I know the Kindle's vulnerabilities, but at the moment, this app seems just fine. In my opinion, this is as good as free protection gets.<br /><br />Just a quick note to fellow app users... As great & popular as are some applications, check those permissions being given to the application. I have great suspicion of fairly simple apps & games requiring access to sensitive or personal info. Why should \\"Tic Tac Toe\\" need my Wi-Fi accounts, network info and telephone contact lists?
B00005MP58|5.0|We used to have a copy of this, but it got lost. We were happy to be able to replace it.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|3 things...<br /><br />1) The Kindle Fire has a built-in camera app. Invoke \\"PHOTO\\" from the top menu bar. Note the little camera icon. It even uses the screen as a flash when needed.<br /><br />2) There are numerous free and excellent photo and video camera applications out there. Why pay for \\"free\\" or for what you already have?<br /><br />3) The internal camera will determine \\"High Definition\\" or not. No application can change that. Just 'cause it says \\"HD\\" doesn't mean it will be.<br /><br />The Kindle Fire's camera faces inward (at the user) instead of outward like phone cameras. It's designed for use with video communication applications like \\"Skype\\". Taking photographs with the Kindle is difficult for that reason. Again, no camera app will make that any easier.
B002FOQY2M|4.0|I'm late to Fun. party, so I didn't know what to expect from this album, but it's solid, poppy and consistently good throughout.
B004UID2LC|5.0|THIS little gem is unbelievable and I highly recommend it for anyone who loves You Tube.<br />It is great for saving and sharing later, or for re-watching your favorites over and over.
B0042ETJU2|2.0|This is a review on the product itself, not a qualitative review on the films. Despite repeated contact with Foxconnect, some it perpetuated by them, they have not helped out with supporting the digital copies for U.S. use. Part of the reason for buying this set for me was to have access to the digital copies. Granted, it is an international release, but it was being sold freely in the U.S.<br /><br />Foxconnect directed me to ask Amazon for help; Amazon did not produce this product. At best, Amazon could offer a refund/return scenario, which would not be the point here. Foxconnect is basically not standing behind its product. They tried to instruct me to get the digital copies off the copy discs, but the menu that pops up does not allow this to happen for at least two of the films.<br /><br />If not for the films themselves, I would give this one star.
B00555X8OA|4.0|We don't understand how we think or why we come up with certain ideas.  This book helps.  I have not finished it.
B00D8HNR2K|2.0|Felt like I was listening to Reznor trying to do a Moby impersonation. Album is a big letdown after a surprise return to recording. Trent's side project with his wife is better than this material.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Plenty of suspense that kept me reading beyond the time I really had available.  Worse, I had to immediately start reading &#34;The Hit&#34;.  Baldacci  is very good!
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|When I first cracked open the book all I saw were photos and I was a little disappointed. But a closer look showed the wonderful design that allows the captions to be part of art and not compete with over overshadow the photos for your attention.  One thing that sets Brandon's work apart is his ability to truly connect with his subjects.  The questions he ask are so simple (think \\"Inside the Actor's Studio\\") and yet illicit such though provoking statements that make you realize that life is hard and joyous for everyone at different times in their lives.  Wisdom from children and adults as well as cautionary tales from poor choices.  Filled with hope, kindness, chutzpah, and exuberance. I've lived in the NYC area for 15 years but Brandon helps us really SEE and FEEL the souls that make this place special.<br /><br />I'm certain he could shed the same light on all areas of our country but he's just one man.  It's our responsibility to see these things in those around us and he's shown us that it's there for the taking if we're kind, patient and generous with each other.<br /><br />Such a wonderful book!
0756407915|3.0|I like the book but the training with the Adem is so typical for a story of this kind. Hero trains to become powerful. Been there, done that. It's fine and all but the author does something I hate. He creates a Godlike character which is a big no no but then he takes the lazy way out by taking away the god's powers. I absolutely can't stand that tact. Don't make them too powerful to begin with. That's a much better alternative. I'm not a big fan of GRRM but at least he's smart enough to restrain his childlike fantasies of superhuman power.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It,s great for the kids and for the adults for something amusing and fun to do. So I suggest it for all ages.
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|I was profoundly disappointed with Doctor Sleep. I had re-read the original 'The Shining\\" in preparation and the contrast between the two was night and day. For me, there was none of the suspense, nor the pure storytelling genius we have grown accustomed to with King.<br /><br />I felt the whole effort (and it indeed felt like an effort) was juvenile in nature. I wish I had just waited my turn for the library copy instead of shelling out the cash. It just wasn't worth it.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Speaker for the Dead is a beautiful oops written by a true humanist! I recommend any fiction reader grab hold of this book and take a ride to a beautiful place

B00FPH6AXE|1.0|I usually wouldn't get on here to complete a review, but this movie sucked so badly that I just had to leave a review. Okay without spoiling the movie I'm just going to say that this should've been a SyFy channel Monday night movie. You \\"Will\\" be disappointed. It's supposed to be 1000 years after Earth but everything is pretty much the same size except for this giant bird. From the previews I was expecting something other than baboons and random cold weather to have taken over the planet after 1000 years. Please folks if you're thinking of having a movie night with friends skip this movie. If you are debating between this movie and another, you might as well choose ThanksKilling on Netflix. I want my money back!!!
B008JFUR10|5.0|I loved this movie, Del Toro did it again!!! Everything he does turns to Gold!!!! It doesn't hurt that one of the main characters is Idris Elba either!!! I could go into all the adventure and images but you just have to see this visual feast!!! He is a master film maker of the utmost, he made the movie feel like the book!!! I loved Del Toro and I love Elba!!! So if you a sci-fi, adventure movie then you won't be disappointed!!!!!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Makes me laugh and keeps me interested. Always good. If you haven't seen it you don't know what you are missing.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Concise, inspiring, informative, and great book about Tesla. I like the fact that it didn't only focus on telling a story about someone, but that it told it with excitement and awe of genius. I feel my time reading this short book was well invested.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This game takes up a huge amount of space on your device. That is the only really negative thing I have to say about it.<br /><br />On the positive side, it is the perfect game for a tablet. I have played it incessantly now for weeks.<br /><br />I wish there were more of it and that it  had internet multiplayer.<br /><br />Other than that it is a spectacular game.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|The developers keep it challenging.  The tasks are fun and achievable.  I could play this game for hours, if I didn't keep running out of energy.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Made me feel like a kid again! What else would be cooler?, you got huge monsters and robots fighting each other!
0802473156|5.0|I have purchased this for a few friends and I swear by it! I learned more about my Love Language and always practice it with my boyfriend! Needless to say, our relationship has improved SIGNIFICANTLY!!!! Thanks, Gary Chapman!!!
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|I think others are way to critical. I think this book is great. I think he made a lot of bold statements, but he is one of the leading thinkers of our time. I think some people hate this book because they disagree fundamentally with some of the statements that Malcolm Gladwell made. I think the book and the underlying message has a lot of intellectual value.
039916409X|5.0|I haven't bought the book yet ONLY because I am signing in to a 6 months program that includes it because Margaret's work has already changed my life. Cannot wait to read this material which I am sure is amazing. Her funny yet very informative and serious (i know it sounds incongruent but you'll see is not) way of writting this miracle working technique will leave you speachless
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|What a fun movie!  predictable, but giant robots fighting monsters, with a different twist.  Very enjoyable movie.  Would recommend to any sci fi fan.
1451627297|5.0|I never thought King would touch the time travel logic genre, but of course he does it in a way no one else can.  It's so much more than a story about stopping Oswald on that fateful day and more about everyday lives and how their impact can be equally important in the universe as a whole.
B00EA8UEZ4|2.0|I waited for this book to be released for so many years and I find that reading it produced one long forgiveness lesson starting with the price!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|There was not enough action in this latest Game of Thrones installment.  Very long and long winded book.  It seems as though it is time to tie the lose ends and finish this tale.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Could not put it down. Only problem, went to fast! Need more rooms! So challenging, I hard to beat it. No way was I letting this game win.
B005VSRFEA|5.0|This book provided a wonderful complement to analytical and mathematical/symbolic methods of analysis, and filled a number of gaps in understanding diverse processes/fields. The material is presented in a very accessible yet thoughtful fashion. Ms. Meadows has a gift for cutting through intellectual clutter to express profound ideas. While I did not &#34;hang on every word&#34; (there were some views I could not agree with), I nonetheless can heartily recommend this book to anyone who craves a better understanding of the difficult dynamics confronting the modern world. The material is well organized, and conveniently summarized in the rear portion of the book.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|For some reason the game won't play, I downloaded it and it's just a dark screen that pops up. Now I won't give it a bad rating cause I have it for counsel and it's awesome.. But please, can someone tell me what's wrong. :(
B004HD61KE|5.0|I am a big fan of all of James Rollins work. His stories always combine action and fiction with a fair amount of truth.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|I love all of the Marvel movies and this one was so wonderful that I watched it twice and can see myself watching it again.  Action packed, fun and entertaining.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|This book is full of little meditations designed to get you off your ass and face your doubts.  It's not just for the artistically minded; it's for anyone.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Very good good book. Would recommend to other readers.  Helped pass the time on my days off.  Great series. Have a nice day.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I've watched the Giant Bomb Endurance run of this game and have played the PS2 version so this game holds an endearing place in my heart.  The extra content and additonal after game chapter makes it well worth the re-purchase price.  Marie's character is well integrated into the story and I enjoyed her story arc.  I've played this game for over 100 hours now and ths is the first game I've ever made it my goal to 100 percent and get the platinnum trophy.<br /><br />A MUST BUY FOR ANY PERSONA OR JRPG FAN!!!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This game is fun and addictive.  I've been playing a few days now and was up to level 18 with 7 dragons,  some breeding,  one in an event, about to hatch,  my entire Island clear.  Even put a few bucks into the game and when I just logged in I was back at level one and everything was gone.  I'm super disappointed and debating if I should even try again
B00005JNQS|5.0|I just opened and watched this movie with my kids the other day. Very cute and fun movie that we got to share.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|A witty, quick read that's hard to put down.  It's always interesting to read the backstory that makes you like the author even more than before.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Great history lesson of the time before, during and after WWII.  Between the facts the story is built  through the lives of several different main characters, their lives in England, Germany, Russia and America.  My criticism of the book:  All these love affairs Were too trite and  all the loose ends are tied together in the end.
B0016JBCJW|5.0|I saw this film for the first time several years ago and it entranced me immediately. I'm not sure what aspect really does it for me; if its the indie style, the character's strange chemistry, or the clever nuances throughout the movie. I highly suggest this film for everyone!
B005O7PXNS|5.0|I love Castle and during the break I went back and watch it from the beginning.  You notice things you missed the first time around.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I'm really impressed with how in depth Charles Duhigg goes into how habits are formed and how we can recognize and change habits in a systematic way. If you're currently not happy with a particular part of your life, this book will help you learn why you are currently doing what you are doing and will help you identify how to change that habit into something that benefits you.<br /><br />Definitely worth a read.
0394800389|5.0|I have loved this book since I was little, and now I am excited to be able to read it to my own child.  Baby isn't here yet, but I read it to my husband and my tummy one night last week, and it was a lot of fun.  The tongue twisters are sure to make kids laugh, and even a baby will enjoy hearing mommy and daddy giggle as they try to wrap their mouths around the words.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|Great story.<br />Related a lot to all the characters.<br />Loved the dialogues.<br /><br />Helen thanks for the book.<br /><br />You nailed it !!!!
B00000IMTH|5.0|I dont know how many different copies of this record I bought, vinyl, CD, Cd remastered.<br />This is one I did not wanna live without.<br />If I had 10 records on an island this would be one, next to Rising.<br />You hear the first beats of Cozy and you right there.<br />Then it just keeps going, Kill the King and his solos. You just wish this setup would have made more records but thanks god there is a lot of life stuff of this line up.<br />I was hoping for a 25 years double CD version but no luck..<br />Turn it up 11 is not good enough for this one.
B004JMZPJG|3.0|Decent bag with a a good selection of compartments and partitions. Zippers stick a little bit when it's not completely full.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|After spending sometime collecting many negatives and slides from my family members of the past 50 years, I got on my project to digitalize them all in order to conserve easily them. I went to Amazon looking for a digital scanner/converter. I read all available reviews of this category of scanners and decided on any scanner within 80/100 rating. This is one of the few I found because some reviews mentioned that a few hundreds of films could be done within a day. I decided on this one and got it within a week.<br />Since I was forewarned. I was not surprised about its physical aspects. Though It is so light, I have to steady it with one hand while operating with the other. It is very easy to use. The end result is acceptable, depending of course on the quality of the films.<br />The feeding mechanism does really set back my expectations. The ends of my old film strips are curved. It takes me so much time trying to guide them through the holder. I emailed Customer Services and it was ok'd to feed the strips without using the holder. Now it take more time with every strip to get it through the exit slot. Since I am not inherently creative,  I give up and send it back.<br />I appreciate Amazon for making the return hassle-free.<br />I would recommend it. Anybody with ample time and with a little more creativity than I would use it efficiently.
B00FJ30OD6|5.0|I LOVE this show!!!! The characters are amazing and the story lines are awesome. Please Alicia choose Peter over Will.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|Was very fun. Wish it lasted longer. But was a great little mystery and seek game.<br />Would recommend it to anyone. Looking forward to playing the sequel!
0810970686|5.0|I bought this for my 9 year old son to finish his series collection.  Perfect and nothing wrong with it.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I Luv this game but its not all free once I could get off the ship it wants us to get the full. version and I am not wasting my money to just pay for it. Why cant it be free?
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This game is extremely fun and easy to play.I like to play in the evening to relax.I enjoy playing in all the different rooms.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I tried about 5 other apps like this, and they were all very cumbersome. This app is exactly what I was looking for! The videos are easy to download, easy to find after they are downloaded, and the interface is extremely intuitive. I love this!! I am using it on a Kindle Fire HD and it works perfectly. Thank you!
B004WGGQPQ|3.0|my kids love this app and are always fighting each other to play with it, but if im away from wifi it complains about wanting an internet connection.  remove that requirement and its a 5 star app
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it it just needs more animals but other than that it's fine I like building island's I love it
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I love the energy this book renews in every cell of your body. Putting back possibility into expired beliefs. An easy read, but an important one ;)
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|I love this. On first listen i thought wow. Sure the voice is not what it was but the music is. Thanks Paul.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Saved my day a couple of times, works as the description said it would, Nd I have nothing to complain about.
B008JFUORW|1.0|OK, the Hangover series was never one to show classy or intelligent humor.<br /><br />But... this one tries so hard to be offensive and gross that they forgot to make it funny. I guess gross, dumb humor have its fans but if one can't get even a chuckle in the entire movie, what's the point.<br /><br />Waste of time.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I've had kik for years on my kindle fire but like about a month ago my friend sent me a message and when i saw her she said that i never sent her one back so i checked  my kik and it said,&quot; login in or create a new account&quot; so i tried logining in but it just said ,&quot;this is tak i ng longer than it should, try again in a bit .&quot;so like 20 days later i tried it and it said tje same thing so i tried creating a new account but it said the same exact thing so i deleted it and did that stuff all over again but it said the same thing so i told my friend that i thought it would never work again and she said okay and i was like why didn't you tell me that you didn'tcare but i onlysaid it in my head because i would never say that to her
B005HSL626|4.0|fun and mindless.  A great break. I wish they would not require so many words for a review.  It is annoying
B00594XOZU|1.0|It dosent even let me log on it says tht something is wrong with it :(<br />Now i bet that all the ppl that messaged me are all mad =/
0142407542|5.0|My children (aged 2 and 4) enjoy all Julia Donaldson books, and the Gruffalo's Child is no exception. Should also get the DVD to go along with the book.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I find the game fun and entertaining. I have yet to spend any money on it. I don't mind having to wait for energy, that keeps me from wasting a ton of time on the game.
039916409X|5.0|If you're ready to break out of the grind and into the palace of possibilities then this book is a MUST read. Margaret shares specific steps on \\"how to\\" break out of the money struggle so you can reach your dream numbers with a powerful tool called the Emotional Freedom Techniques. It works!
B005DOKM9M|1.0|The appearance is nice, but it doesn't fit my Kindle Fire HD. It's almost big enough, but I find that it's impossible to zip closed with the Kindle inside.
B000PC0SPU|5.0|Looking into the future is usually the purview of science fiction authors; however, Daniel Pink takes a peek and inspires.
B0024FADAQ|4.0|An unusual idea. I just like shows about space. It was a favourite of<br />mine when it was first released.
B000PKG7TI|5.0|I never discovered Nightwish until very recently when I happened across Within Temptation. What did I do to miss these bands for so long but thankfully both have material in my collection now.<br /><br />I agree with many that the video editing and quality is a bit lacking on this DVD but it does capture the energy and excitment of the event. It's a crying shame that this was Tarja's last gig, as I've since listened to other female leads but none can hold a candle to the powerful voice of Tarja. My god, can that lady sing. All this would be of little consequence if she didn't have such brilliant support and I can't fault amy of them for the part they played in this wonderful concert. The bass player actually is a fine singer too and doesn't just growl all the time and his style complements the soprano. He is in terrific form on Pink Floyd's High Hopes number and Vuorinen really nails it too. Although some have stated that Nevalainen might not be the most technical of drummers I find his playing is full of energy and although as ugly as sin he is vey energetic and has charisma lacking in other percussionists. The song where Holopainen asks the audience to quieten down is staggering and for me is the shows highlight. Phantom and Wish I Had an Angel are also standouts. Hell I like them all although I tend to skip the indian chief numbers. They don't sit quite so well with the rest of the concert im my opinion.<br /><br />Thanks to the songwriting skills of Tuomas, Nightwish were and continue to be a thoroughly entertaining band and I'm real glad I discovered them through this DVD. Thoroughly recommended if you can put up with the slightly inferior video quality. Still giving it 5 stars.
B000003BZ4|4.0|Of all the attempts by latter day rockers to get that 70s vintage sound, this is the one true success.  Warren Haynes sounds like a man who cut his teeth in session work for Muddy Waters in the 50s, traded ideas in late-night jam sessions with Clapton and Allman in the 60s, and was the secret key influence on the likes of Paul Rodgers and Boz Scaggs in the 70s.  This album explodes with rock, blues, and soul power.  The opening sequence from the a capella Son House blues &#34;Grinnin' in Your Face&#34; to the spine-tingling &#34;Mother Earth&#34; sets the tone for music that grabs you by the you know where and doesn't let go.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|This book has all the elements of a big adventure, but the book seems slightly predictable. Seems....a huge empire with a powerful king who oversees a kingdom that lives in a protective ring. The kingdom flourishes but always in the shadow of evil hovering just outside the rings magical barrier. This book set up the storyline for several books in the series. What seems so obvious often gets turned upside down. This books reminds me of the first Harry Potter book in which everything seems great and wonderful. But you are left wondering just what could got wrong.....and it does. Knights, dragons and magic, OH YES!!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Played similar games on the computer but this is perfect for my phone...needs more levels though. Good game for lunch break boredom!!
1250038820|5.0|I follow Brandon on Facebook and ordered his book early and am delighted with it all -- he makes me proud to be a human in New York~
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I have no complaints about this product. The color is nice, it shuts off the kindle when I close it up and when I open it comes back on where I had left it. Would always get it again
B001BC2ZS6|3.0|I read it so I could help my daughter with her Grade 8 school project, it is a great book for that age group.
0896898288|5.0|Perfect condition, love all the stories about the blocks and am looking forward to getting my own farmer quilt finished.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|The game itself is alright, has decent graphics, very little freezing or lagging, and it's free. However, the tutorial in the beginning is not as indepth as it could be, and leaves quite a few important things for you to figure out (like how to get more then 80 meat or greens in twenty minutes).<br />It also has very few dinosaurs. You only get a constant of about six, and one will sometimes be the special dinosaur of the week, available for you to purchase.  I'm not huge on spending real money on small things inside the game, so this is lost and wasted on me.<br />There is also a gap between missions around level five, where you struggle for experience to get to level six.<br />This might just have happened for me because I didn't sit and stare at the screen of my Kindle for five hours straight tapping the meat and green docking houses, but I'm not really into that mind numbing gameplay either.<br />I also get advertisements in Spanish, even though I stress that I'm not interested, and the rest of the game is in English, it will randomly pop up in the middle of my gameplay.<br />Overall, good game play, it's fun to find the amber for the dinosaurs, and be able to move their exhibits around, and expand as much as you can want, but more variety in the species of dinosaur would be excellent. Ones you don't have to pay for, too.
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|This DVD will keep drinks from leaving water rings on your furniture and provide a nice tax write off for the studio.
B004RFYEEC|5.0|After years of sifting through expensive bootlegs, trying to piece it together in a way that makes sense, seeing reports of some kind of release come and go, and loving Brian's solo recreation but wanting to hear the real thing (or what there is of it before it was abandoned), here's everything you could possibly want.  I'm more certain than ever that this would have turned the pop music world on its head had it been finished and released in early 1967.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This novel is the best I have read in months. It's so beautifully sad, you hate what happens but you just need to keep reading to truly understand.  And of course by the time you start reading you've already fallen in love with it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Can't wait for the next one!  It's a shame such a talented writer is no longer with us.<br />The Mitch Rapp Series will be sorely missed.
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|Jack Reacher should be an incredibly deep character, but instead, in this book, he's a victim of luck, apparently.<br /><br />It seems rather weak that some guy with a deep past decides to randomly tour the East coast, but he does, and *immediately* stumbles upon some incredible conspiracy.  If there was even ONE iota of suggestion that that was the reason he landed there, this book would have immediately been worth four stars.  But the connection is weak.<br /><br />Nope, this dude accidentally landed in a conspiracy -- and COINCIDENTALLY involves his long-lost brother -- and the rest of the book is basically about Jack being in the right place at the right time.  And it's just lucky that Jack has the skills to solve the problem.  And that he's met the right people at the right time.  And that things happen randomly the way they do.  And...<br /><br />No, this book should be rewritten, because it's a great idea, but very poorly executed.
B0045HCJRG|3.0|The movie was a cute suprise of life viewed from a different perspective.<br />It shows the difference in different personalities. How some do good in Isolation and others don't.
B003G4W49C|4.0|This is an action-adventure story that's perfect for middle school-age kids!  It's clean, there's some violence, but no gore.  It explores the life of one kid, and though character development doesn't go as deep as it should, it's perfect for the age range.<br /><br />The book ends poorly, but I'm probably biased because I've ready many much better books.  At the time this was published, if I were in the seventh grade, I'd have probably thought this was the coolest book I had ever read.
B0076DL1KC|3.0|As with all foreign discs, I cannot attest to this version being appropriately remastered (color timed, proper scanned from a decent print, etc.). However, as with most of Lynch's works, the only one I have that is on BLU-RAY was BLUE VELVET. Almost everything else except DUNE, I have to get overseas prints of the title. If you are in a region A country like I am, then it will be the Japanese releases you will want, because they are region A too. (Blu-Ray) Check carefully for ENGLISH AUDIO too. American titles in Japan SHOULD have this. Anyways, outside of this, if you are not picky, and you desire is to just have this movie on Blu-Ray, regardless of quality, and special features are not your forte, then BUY THIS. I give it 3 stars because I AM picky, however, I like DL, and I haven't seen this movie in over a decade.
B004J4WKUQ|2.0|There's no question that Ernest and I have a lot in common, personally.  Reading this book, I wanted to hang out with him, and definitely exchange library collections of comics, DVDs, books, and CDs.  And drinks!<br /><br />The thing is, these characters just sucked.  They're boring.<br /><br />The book started out with incredible power, and very interesting characters, and within a few chapters they were all the same characters with different names.  I unfortunately did the same thing in the first draft of my first book, but I worked hard to fix that.  I wish Ernest's editors had given him the same time and attention, because he's a great storyteller.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to his next book, because I think that's going to be the real deal.  This one?  Don't bother.  It's just a bunch of shout outs to the 80's with any real substance.
B003NX76BM|5.0|Nora Roberts is an exceptional author.  She blends mystery, love and family and a great story.  No wonder she is a best selling author.  Never disappoints.
B0006399FS|5.0|This album is for me their best since Zooropa, and that was more than 10 years since the release of this album. This album had a good tracklist and had some good songs, for me it was a complete album from the band.
0805047905|5.0|Awesome, used, and perfect!! We will beat up books too - no need for a new one you want to keep in perfect shape.
B008JFUR10|5.0|I didn't know much about the film other than it had something to do with robots fighting monsters and it got some pretty bad reviews and it didn't do as well at the box-office as expected so I was pretty hesitant about spending the money for the DVD.<br /><br />Apparently I'm not as smart as some people because I thought the explanation of how the monsters appeared was just fine. But then when I watch a film I'm not out to analyze it to death.<br /><br />The film had a good story and explained everything as much as it needed to be explained.  The actors did their job, the special effects where great and the fight scenes were exciting to watch.  There was drama, suspense, a bit of humor, and even an emotional scene or two.<br />All in all, it's a fun two hours!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was such a great book! I was not expecting to get hooked but I did. I loved it and read the entire trilogy!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Whenever I need a calculator I used to have to go looking through my desk or computer bag.  With this app a calculator is always only a tap away, since my kindle firs is almost always with me.
B00992CF6W|3.0|HEY JEB MORE UPDATES NOW I MEAN like the one for anything but the kindle fire<br />or Apple products so put out 0.7.6 for them
1439190275|5.0|I love this book! It is so much better than the old version. They go to great lengths to help you understand how this plan works within your body and can be adapted for any lifestyle.
B00DXLO0D6|3.0|The 2013 Sony packaging is worse than Mill Creek releases in the paper envelopes.  Everything is stacked on one spoke in a flimsy plastic tray that is already starting to rip as soon as I take the discs out to see if they are all there. Will need to repackage. Have not watched yet for video quality.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|Riffs and melodies that stay in your head all day.(title song, Lies and Truths, Jumpin in, Jumpin out, etc..) Great songs, sound and playing. I'll Put a Stone On Your Cairn has a lot of feeling, too. One of his more consistent albums, I think.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|These guys are so good!!  It is such a pleasure to listen AND watch these guys perform.  Beautiful music AND fun.
1401938906|5.0|If you are a fan of \\"The Secret\\" and a true explorer of metaphysical concepts, you will definitely appreciate this book. If you are a newbie to \\"new thought,\\" you will probably either be puzzled or disappointed. In order to do the experiments, you have to have a trust in the Universe and this doesn't come until you've baby-stepped along for awhile and gotten to a certain point. This book is a non-fiction, simplified version of a novel written in 2010 called \\"Legs in the Attic.\\" And a second novel called \\"A Man Who Couldn't Dream.\\" If you are having difficulty with accepting these experiments and concepts, it might help to read these novels that present much of the same material but in a rich tapestry of plot, characters and further metaphysical concepts. E-squared is definitely a book that will help humanity take the next step toward understanding that there is more to life than most of us understand or admit. There is a power available that can change our individuals lives, as well as the world. If we become aware of it, and use it!
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|Book was great as it gave each story it's own chapter and let the reader make the connections. The movie chops the storyline up trying to give the viewer parallels. May have been a good idea but falls apart in execution. BEST ADVICE: Invest the time you'd waste watching this movie and read the book.
B000JMKO3C|5.0|What is there to say? I've never been disappointed by Coelho. His books are always a good read, and they each have a special place in my heart
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Great acting but very slow and b-o-r-i-n-g. Fell asleep thru it and couldn't bear to watch it again. And I'm usually very interested in the history and life of Lincoln.
B00D7OXZTY|5.0|It is surprising that few piano superstars record full albums of Chopin's Polonaises.  In the 1970's Maurizio Pollini recorded a vinyl LP of 7 of Chopin's Polonaises.  That recording was made in Vienna's famous 'Golden Hall'.<br />With the sad passage of time and the coming of digitisation, the original LP recording got onto clattering and shrill sounding CDs, and unless you play those CDs on a fine set of vacuum tube amplifiers, there is no escape of harshness and brittleness, hence Pollini's Polonaise Album has been, since the 1980's, considered as 'bang bang' stuff with little musical sensitivity (some thing which is of course totally untrue).<br />I still play Pollini's CD (\\"Originals\\" version) on vacuum tube amps.  They are not great in accoustics, but I can hear quite well the musical expressions - the fiery temperament and high degree of musical concentration.<br />After well-nigh 40 years, Rafal Blechacz picked a programme exactly the same as Pollini's.  I do not intend to compare the two in detail.  Suffice it to say that the very first impression is that DG has, this time, taken great pains to ensure that the accoustics are 'right', and the entire set of Polonaises are very finely recorded indeed.<br />While I would refrain from unnecessary comparisons, generally speaking, the first three numbers ending with the 'Military' are better performed by Pollini (subjective view only).  I feel that Pollini has more musical nuance and a more relaxed pacing for these three pieces.  The first two offer better lyricism, which is in any event a hallmark of Chopin's works.  The third, the 'Military', in Pollini's hands are more fiery and more rhythmically alert.  Whereas young Blechacz plays all three pieces with pronounced rigor but lessor refinement.<br />The table, however, begins to turn starting from the Op. 44 Polonaise.  This is the second longest piece in the entire programme, and really, Rafal Blechacz's reading is about the best ever.

B00D29CBIU|5.0|I don't just jump onto anyone's bandwagon. There are so many teachers and techniques. But Margaret Lynch had me at hello. She still needed to convince me with her knowledge and experience. But I could tell immediately, this woman was the real deal. She knew the pain of money issues personally. But more than that, she understood the blockages we have around money and addresses them like a real person. Yes, the techniques can work like magic, but they are grounded in real human feelings we can all relate to.<br /><br />And that is what makes the difference for me. Lets get real. Money can be a painful issue! Which is why it stays a problem no matter how many times you try to overcome it. No matter how many books you read or seminars you attend. I felt very frustrated because I would have some success and then back to the same problem. And let's be honest, feeling embarrassed and even more ashamed.<br /><br />With the transformational knowledge and techniques Margaret Lynch provides, I finally saw movement and lasting results with my financial issues. I could really understand and apply what she was saying. And most if all, this was a person I could trust. Who wasn't just out to make her own money off of other people's problems.<br /><br />Margaret Lynch is the real deal and on a mission. I highly recommend this book and her teachings. If you really want to understand and find your way into a new relationship with money which actually works! Thank you Margaret Lynch, for being willing to put yourself out there and guide the rest of us, into a new world of wealth.
039916409X|5.0|I've been working through childhood issues for a long time now, with some limited success.  Despite my best efforts, I keep having the same job experiences, the same income, attracting the same people and getting nowhere.  The financial paradigms I experience over and over again seem like dead elephants I drag around on a rusty chain.  But then this wonderful book came out.  Margaret Lynch has shown me a way to change those paradigms.  A major problem has been identifying them -- so many things have happened to me that sometimes it's hard to figure out which ones have energetically stuck and are holding me back (those dead elephants again!).  The exercises in this book are helping me to identify the (sometimes painful) experiences and tap them down and out and give those poor elephants a proper burial!<br /><br />What's different and wonderful about Margaret's book is that she has synthesized the tapping scripts down to core issues -- even if you don't really know what they are!  That's what I found so great about this book.  Tapping helps you to clear the emotional charge of things that have been held in the subconscious but I find it really hard sometimes to figure out exactly what some of these are.  Margaret's scripts and exercises in Tapping Into Wealth are the key to figuring these out.<br /><br />And it gets better.  After I had done some tapping on my feelings about my income (which you ascertain and look at as one of the exercises), I realized that I could use the exercise on limiting paradigms in other aspects of my life.  By now you're probably figured out that I'm a mess!  There, I said it.  But that's another thing I love about this book.  Sometimes we're so intimidated by our problems that we tend to shove them under the rug with positive affirmations that go against our subconscious programming and keep us stuck!  Margaret's book guides us to a gentle but realistic look at our lives and the beliefs we hold that hold us back -- I'm a loser!  I'm a failure! (admit it, that's what you really think) -- and then to dissipate these beliefs by tapping them down and out.  It's really freeing.<br /><br />Thank you, Margaret Lynch!  You truly are a rockstar on a mission!ure! (admit it, that's what you really think) -- and then to dissipate these beliefs by tapping them down and out.  It's really freeing.<br /><br />Thank you, Margaret Lynch!  You truly are a rockstar on a mission!

I would TOTALLY give This game 1000000000000000 stars if I could. :D
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|I saw this movie at the theater and loved every moment - I am a fan of Shakespeare and I guess the negative reviews here are in part from those who are unfamiliar with Shakespeare. It's beautifully and lovingly shot in black and white, it is deliberately simple and low budget - the key here is the script and the acting. The script can't be bettered and the acting is top drawer. Player more humorously than many productions - funny, human and infused with Jos Whedon's trademark light touches.  For what its worth if you are not familiar with Shakespeare - then just relax, don't try and understand every word or phrase and let the story and dialogue wash over you - you will not be disappointed.
B009KWU6Q2|3.0|I certainly enjoyed Peter Pan the original movie, and as a child watching Mary Martin play Peter Pan on TV, but this movie just seemed tedious and I could hardly wait for it to end.  I normally like the acting of Robin Williams, Dustin Hoffman, and Julia Roberts, but they seemed too self conscious of themselves.  I knew I was supposed to like the movie but just couldn't quite.

B00F56AZK4|4.0|I love the puzzle selections and the fact that you can decide on your number of pieces.  However, I do not like the fact that the screen will only work one way.

B00BEZTMFY|3.0|Look, I get it.  THE HOBBIT is a whimsical children's tale, about a hobbit and 13 dwarves and a wizard attempting to recapture Erebor from Smaug, the fire-breathing, greedy (original 1 per center) dragon.  Dwarf names like Ori, Nori, Dori, Kili, Fili, only lend themselves to the light-hearted nature of this tale, originally written and published for children around 9 to 12 years of age.  It was a far cry from Tolkien's much more ominous, dark, brooding 'The Lord of the Rings'. . .which is why I'll never understand why terrific director/producer/writer Peter Jackson would even try to make such a silly story into a massive, three-part epic.  In order to do this, Jackson had to go back and mine the Appendices, and backstory, of 'Lord of the Rings'; the villain of this first installment of THE HOBBIT, Azog, is a product of the Appendices.  So what we have here, although it's a beautifully crafted, well-made, visually impressive film, is a 3-hour cartoon, sans the utter darkness of Jackson's previous presentation of [[ASIN:B000654ZK0 The Lord of the Rings]].  It is a wonderful film to watch, augmented by Howard Shore's haunting musical score, but it's an uneven, often thinly-veiled depiction of what should be a two-hour light snack.<br /><br />I've got no problems with the cast, either; Ian McKellen returns as the wizard Gandalf, and Martin Freeman turns in an outstanding performance as Bilbo Baggins, 60 years previous than the Ian Holm depiction in 'Lord of the Rings'.  Other solid performances include a stern-looking Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield, and I especially liked the performances of Graham McTavish (Dwalin), James Nesbitt (Bofur), and Aidan Turner (Kili).  From the original 'Lord of the Rings' production, Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, Elijah Wood, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, and Andy Serkis, all return for brief appearances.  Yet the whimsical, child-like nature of this film springs forth in spades, from the gaudy haircuts/outfits of the dwarves, to the animated hordes of Orcs; again, all of this lends itself to the notion that THE HOBBIT in its entirety should have been a lighthearted, two-hour film.  It was grand to revisit gorgeous New Zealand, a character in itself as Middle Earth, and was grand to meet once again all the characters we have come to love from 'Lord of the Rings'.  But Peter Jackson's THE HOBBIT:  AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY, the first installment of a massive three-part epic, is a mile wide, an inch deep, and a visual cartoon that meanders a tad too long.<br />--D.

030758836X|5.0|Forgetting the fact the author was from Missouri, the locale was incorrect according to my mother in law, who also read this book.<br />I didn't pick up on that, as I do not know Missouri, so I just sat back and enjoyed the plot.<br /><br />I digress.<br />Gone Girl started off amazingly - the story played out with many twists and turns.<br /><br />The story took you on a roller-coaster of emotion, and I felt myself switching between who I had sympathy for - the husband, or the \\"gone\\" wife.<br /><br />I'm not one to reveal anything in my reviews, but I could imagine this book as a movie.<br /><br />The ending of the novel very much disappointed me though. One of the characters just accepted their fate, when me, the reader, expected more.<br />Whether this was intentional to set up for a following novel, I don't know - but it left that feeling of being ripped off.
B00B9E29CI|4.0|The government, educationists, school teachers...all need to read this. How do you nurture the young, show them the path to success through character, character building by focussing on qualities such as perseverance, grit, conscientiousness. The author brings out the role of character in defining success. A very good and recommended  read. This is so crucially important for a country like India, where our (millions of deprived) kids need to be shown the path, guided and their character built so that they are good and successful citizens when they grow up.
B002HWUU2C|3.0|I really liked Once, and the first Swell Season had a few tracks as good as the Once soundtrack (and a few repeats in slightly different versions).  Strict Joy I found disappointing.  After a few listens none of the tracks stand out as favorites.  There are a number of Glen Hansard tracks that I find lackluster.  The collaborations are somewhat more appealing.  I got the deluxe version.  The DVD of the live performance was worth a look, but not something I would watch very many times.  The live concert recording I listened to once, but it is mostly the familiar earlier material with nothing that different or exciting.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Many of the reviews that I read for Entwined in you were negative...and angry.  Readers are left hanging at the end of the story BUT, I appreciate Day taking the time to make the story more believable. The time she takes to develop the characters is phenomenal.  We see Ava grow and learn to control her ridiculous insecurities.  The fact that they have known each other for such a short time and have developed a strong connection is believable. I had to reread the other two books and it made much more sense.  Why bash an author for taking time to create quality material?  Just because trilogies are typically what you see in a series right now, doesn't mean EVERYONE has to live and die with in that unspoken expectation.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I enjoy these puzzles,but one glitch is that you have to restart game after three errors, unless you select option to ignore them.<br />Selecting three squares and accidentally touching a wrong button counts as three errors and bam! you have to start over!<br />Very frustrating,because really only a single error.

0385349947|5.0|This is a great, quick read that inspires women who want a career to suppress their guilt and feel good about going after the brass ring.  Written from the perspective of a famous, successful business woman, this book calls women out for their own self-limiting behaviors at work, such as waiting to be \\"picked\\" instead of asking for promotions and sitting at the back of the room instead of at the table.  The book is full of familiar anecdotes and great snippets of advice.<br /><br />The book is bang on.  Sandberg tells her story, and in so doing provides new insights into the real problems women face balancing career and life.  The battle for true equality has stalled and she accurately curates the symptoms.  She also implores women to reach inside themselves for the answers, instead of blaming the system.<br /><br />Where the book may fall short for some is in examples more \\"mainstream\\" women can follow when they don't have the authority, resources and clout of Sandberg.  Further, while she challenges women to step up and take responsibility for their careers, she doesn't remove for them the responsibility for taking care of the family and home.  So, to rise to her ideal, women can ask their husbands for more help and try not to let the guilt get to them, but they never really shed that 2nd full-time job.  For some, the idea of a rock-star career and parenting can seem daunting and not worth the impact to health, wellness, and spirit.<br /><br />My colleagues and I spent two years interviewing college-educated women about their careers.  Similar to Sandberg, we found women held themselves back unnecessarily.  But we don't think it is because women aren't ambitious or don't desire career success.  We think these are symptoms of a bigger problem: Women have bought into an entire self- limiting belief system that influences their decision-making.  We call it the Feminine Filter.  It says we have to Do it All, Look Good, and Be Nice to be liked.  It says we need to putourselves second, wait for recognition, and be humble.  It says our careers are second to our families, friends, and everyone else.  It says we are supposed to focus on meaning, not material things like money and power.  The Feminine Filter says if we follow the rules, we will be taken care of.  But the truth is we won't.  The Feminine Filter goes to the heart of WHY women resist networking, negotiating, and prioritizing their work.  It's why women don't take responsibility for earning a living, and why they keep men from stepping up to family responsibility.<br /><br />We agree with Sandberg the next phase of the women's movement has arrived and that it will take women changing themselves to elevate enough women into positions of power to ultimately fix a broken system.  Battling each other and keeping each other in check is counterproductive for all of us. Bravo to Sandberg for bravely challenging women to step up.<br /><br />But, we can't just keep talking about the symptoms of the problem and throwing advice at women; advice they struggle to follow because it competes with their underlying core belief system.  Network more.  Negotiate.  Find a mentor.  Believe in yourself.  Dream bigger.  This just gives women a sense of futility.  It is time to name the enemy - The Feminine Filter - so we can address it.  Only once women can see the Filter at work in their language and behaviors, and in the language and behaviors of everyone around them, can they begin the process of lasting self-development.  Only when women understand that their current \\"ideal woman\\" doesn't value money or power because she's not supposed to and won't be liked if she does, can they address why negotiation is so difficult for them.  It's more than just trying harder or swallowing the nasty pill.  We need to change our core underlying assumptions to eliminate the resistance.<br /><br />We hope to join Sandberg in launching a wave of lasting, revolutionary change for women.  It's certainly overdue.<br /><br />Kelly Watson Co-author The Orange Line: A Woman's Guide to Integrating Career, Family, & Life

0385350864|4.0|For those nay-sayers who were disappointed with the direction Fielding took Ms. Jones, I'd like to remind them that she did exactly what a real writer is SUPPOSED to do - brought Bridget into the present! Bridget is still funny, full of foibles, slightly full of herself, along with the added dimensions of dealing with motherhood, widowhood, and of course, late to the 21st Century Techno-gadget world. She's typical of many women her age - which is what makes her extraordinary. Fielding kept the best parts of Bridget and carried them through to the present day.<br />\\"Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy\\" is hilarious, engaging, and heartening (as opposed to heart-warming, which is boring, IMO). The many pages of texting in lieu of dialogue are a bit tedious, but the overall book is stellar and worth reading again... and again. It's great to have Bridget Jones, and Helen Fielding back in the game.:)

As Lend- Lease and other support came in the nick of time to enable  Britain to continue the fight against the forces of evil, the  story that Lyn Olsen weaves is one that deserves to be read by a wide audience.

With the Old Breed has done the best job of describing the experience.<br /><br />This is what gave it the 5 stars:There were places in the book that just had my cringing in horror at what was described. I had to put it down at times and just try to wrap my mind around the enormity of Sledge's experience.<br /><br />It was a tough book in that respect. I'm a History buff.  History to a large part is the chronicle of wars.  You sometimes get so caught up in the battles and strategies and effects of the wars that it's easy to forget that the wars fought by people.<br /><br />This book does as good a job of reminding you of that point as any book I've ever read.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I rate this at 3 stars only because I am trying to use it with my desktop computer.  This device really is not intended to be used with this computer, so it is not surprising that it is inconvenient trying to use it this way.  I'm sure it works much more satisfactorily with a laptop or tablet.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent drama! Great acting and good way to<br />Learn history. Would not miss it! We always record it. Downright addictive!
1401938906|2.0|I order the book E2 because I am an open minded person. I've read \\"The Secret\\" and do believe in the possibility of an invisible force that is here for our use. And I would have really enjoyed this book. The experiments is a brilliant idea. However, I was also raised as a Christian and also have belief in my God. When the author spent an entire chapter slamming my faith and pushing her atheistic views upon me (which I certainly didn't buy the book for that) I struggled to continue. I don't think it was necessary and I wouldn't recommend this book to people who also have a base of religion or faith.
0060594888|5.0|It's just an awesome book.<br />Jack's real life examples of success stories are great. You can pick and choose what strategies you want to use, and there are some great ones. This was the first self help book I had every read, I don't think I will ever find another one that lives up to how well this one was done. You will be inspired.<br />The only drawback is that I giggle when he mentions recorders, pads of paper and cue cards, because, well, smart phones!
B005LAIIMG|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie. My 77 year old mother even liked it and she normally would not watch a Zombie movie.
B0007KS7D0|4.0|I was able to install on the G15 without reading documentation.  Big point there.  Nice close ups but the rig to clip the lens to the camera is pretty bulky.  I'll get over it.  I use the plastic box to store filters and anything else that I need to have on hand.  It's a keeper.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I couldn't put it down.  The book provided a spirited discussion by my book group.  Everyone liked it & found it thought provoking.
B002RI9SC4|1.0|I cant' finish the reading. What a piece of CRAP. Badly written, absurd story, stupid characters, and worst of all: is very BORING. I can´t understand what other people see in it.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I use this on my self-defense knives, throwing blades, hunting knives and kitchen utilery. It works great on everything. Coolness
B00CUHMUZ4|5.0|My mother loves Andre Rieu and I have bought many of his DVD's for us to watch together.  My favorite had been the one from Radio City Music Hall, but this is amazing.  The performers' attire, which is always beautiful, elegant and appropriate, has been upgraded.  The scanning of the crowd shows the magnitude of his hometown's love for this man and appreciation for what he has done.  All of the best songs are on this one.  It is a must if you are considering buying this.
B003204MQS|5.0|Love all the Paranormal Activity movies, Different? Yes. I watch them all the time, cant wait for paranormal activity 5. 4 wasn't too bad, hoping 5 Is better, and I am hopin  I used enough words to end this review. Geesh..lol
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|(Follow HONY on FB) I looked forward to this book for some time and its bypassed all expectations. Rich life's truths flow from Brandon's photography, amazing! Congratulations excellent reflection of how a dream came true.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|All I can say is AWESOME! For $35 bucks, this little guy packs some great features. I love the ease of watching a movie. Just buy it on your phone and throw it up in all its HD glory on your TV. It doesn't restrict you from doing anything else on your phone. Throw up a movie on your screen then go out to a party, make phone calls, surf the web, play a game. DOESN'T MATTER! Your video will continue to play uninterrupted!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It's not to bad it work for me so I will be up grading mine soon. I like it simple
B007BGQFTQ|4.0|These books kept my interest. In my opinion, books in a series can sometimes be uneven. One great, the next so-so. Happily, this set was good from beginning to end. I recommend this boxed set.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|LOVE IT!! There are no other words to say but it is a great book. There is no other way to say it.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|I had a problem with my old connection cable that the computer didn't recognize the kindle. This Micro- USB Cable fixed that problem.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Basically pointless but it is so addicting. Once u start playing u dont want to delete it...it looks really girly but its so fun itll make u want to play.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Nice little product to stream YouTube and movies, I tried playing my music I have used the ear phones icon but said it can't play side loaded music.overall good little device.oh it seems to get warn if plugged into the power cord continuously so I use the USB port any so wiil shut off when the TV is off.
B00FEN000S|2.0|The special effects for this movie are AMAZING, but as for the rest of the movie.  I kind of found it a bit lacking.  It kind of felt like the director had to pull back a little bit on the PG-13 rating.  I know it was originally planned to be R.  Charlie Hunnam is not the best in this movie.  And the rest of the characters all kind of feel like they are cheesy.  Wait for it on Starz instead of spending the money to rent it our buy it here.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I started watching this series on Starz and absolutely got enthralled by the storyline and battle scenes!! I plan to own the other seasons as well.
B000JIHP88|5.0|I was told that babies need bright colors to stimulate them, though the mobile that I got my baby for her crib was very pretty she did not pay any attention to it. When I put this mobile on her crib (assembly was very easy), she noticed it right away. When I first brought her in to look at it she was crying, I put her down in the crib, turned the mobile on, and within a minute or two she was totally calm and watching the mobile amazed. Five minutes later she was making all sorts of cooing sounds at it. I got this mobile when she was only 10 weeks. Now at 13 weeks I can put her down in the crib turn on the mobile and have 15 minutes to do whatever I need since she is very entertained. I will be sad when she is too big for it, she loves it so much, I even enjoy watching it, and the music and jungle sounds are very soothing. Overall one of the best purchases I have made for the baby to date.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I chose this rating because i was so happy with the words i found especially the easy words<br />Haha jk

B000ZJTPLG|5.0|I'm a new guitarist and nobody else would want to hear everything I play. I however, am having a ball playing as loud as I want with as much or as little gain as I feel like at the moment with my Classic Rock Guitar Headphone Amp. My Rickenbacker 360 sounds just the way I want, with as much clarity or with all the &#34;smoke&#34; as I feel like dialing in for now. It is SO nice to be free of the amp and cable on the floor and can quickly plug in, put in my ear buds, and practice for a while anywhere I want, anytime I want. Downside: I wish it had a little reverb to dial in or switch on to closer match my full size Vox amp and the controls are small/hard to read but easy to learn. You do get a pop when you turn it on because there is no tube warm up time. Solution: Hit the switch before putting in your buds if your sensitive. I plan to pick up other versions of the amPlug from Vox to extend my fun. This was a good choice. Buy one!
B00DURHYWC|5.0|What I love most about Pink Martini -- and they do not disappoint in this new album -- is that they are never conventional.  Classic pieces I know by heart are here blended and remixed with a new sound.  I love the immersion in languages, which pulls me into listening to the mood and the music of the song rather than just the words/story.  Pink Martini is, for me, full immersion music.
B008602KQI|5.0|Because I have yet to read the book, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I got caught up in both the story and the action. I was not looking for everything from the book and could just enjoy the director's and actor's version of the story on screen. Not too much time was wasted on explaining everything. That is best left up to a book, or up to the viewer's imagination. It is an action, futuristic story done by very good actors in an interesting setting. It has just enough possibility to keep the audience grounded and enough fantasy to fire up your imagination. See it. and read the very popular book.
0316204366|3.0|...but a lot of pages to drag it out.<br /><br />In Gladwell's TED talk &#60;ted.com/talks/malcolm_gladwell_the_unheard_story_of_david_and_goliath.html&#62; he delivers this same message in 15 mins.  I expected a lot more of the book, but was halfway thru the book before I realized there's not a lot more here than in the talk, albeit a lot more detail and stories... but the core concept is simple.<br /><br />P.S. I am a fan - my well-worn copies of Tipping Point and Blink are testament to that.  D&G does not blow me away like those others.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|After much frustration with first generation Kindle not playing videos, I downloaded this app. It was easy to install and loaded right away. The ability to play videos at all levels of resolution makes it ideal for all kindles H.D. or not. I highly recommend it as a no gimmicks or strings attached unlike other vendor and apps in the market.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|love this movie. fast shipping. i havent watched it yet, i got it to replace the one not returned. but im sure it will work great
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I was so into this game, all the beauty that happens. I am happy with the game until level 23 almost 24,  it starts having trouble loading. I contact support services several times..until I read other reviews.  Very Disappointed about this so-called free game! All the time and effort, my son and I put into it!
0385474547|5.0|I was introduced to this book in my Great Books discussion group. It has been one of my favorite books ever since.  The books I recently ordered were to be gifts for my friends.  The author unfortunately has recently died.  He was born in Africa, but he presents a picture of events in Africa when the white culture and the black cultures clash in a clear unprejudiced way. The book made me feel almost like I had lived the experience myself. I had a much warmer feeling for those living these events than I had before reading this book.  I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in understanding the people involved in this period in history.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I believe that this application is a very useful app if you want to download a video without having to watch it on YouTube constantly. There haven't been any bugs using this app on my Galaxy S3.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|It was in great condition and i love the case that it was in. Whats awesome about this is that you get 3 Cd's, not one. I love his music, but it might not be for everyone, so i would suggest you-tubing him first then buy.  But everything was wonderful about this product.

B00CSR2J9I|4.0|An entertaining and challenging game, not too complex but difficult enough to be addictive. I am not a games type person but find myself returning to it many times during the day. On a trans atlantic flight recently where the entertainment system was down, this little app kept my brain cell amused.<br />Nice job.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|My nine year old and I had to read this straight through.  It was amazing.  Well written, a true gem.
B00EK0UBPU|5.0|This book is simply astonishing: detailed life on the New Zealand goldfields in 1866.  A murder mystery that is involved and complicated.  A cast of characters all brilliantly captured and all with more motives than you could imagine.  A complicated structure to the book itself.  and finally........more than 800 pages and it still finishes too soon  - for me at least.  Do not be put off by the highbrow prize - which it deserved - this book is reading entertainment at its very best.  DO NOT MISS IT!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love this type of futuristic sci-fi.  A friend recommended it to me.  Am looking forward to reading this author's other stories.
0307949508|2.0|The Girl Who Played With Fire, sequel to The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, is basically a western, only the cowboys have been replaced by young women between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five, the sheriff is a white-knight magazine publisher, and the OK Corral is cyberspace--them wide-open spaces, and then some.<br /><br />Larsson's skills are not in question; this is a page-turner, if you like turning pages.  But the underlying premise--that Lisbeth should engage our interest because she can kick the living hell out of men weighing four times as much as she does, compose elegant mathematical formulae while munching on store-bought pizza, and leap tall buildings in a single bound, is a pretty weak one.  Larsson's books are a plea for attention from people who are already paying attention--and paying good money to learn things they already know.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Purchased this book on a daily deal because the reviews were good. It was one of the best stories I've read in a long time.  I couldn't put it down.  Miss Kline is a great storyteller.  It's a keeper I'll read again.  It captured my attention from the first paragraph to the last.  High praise for the author.  Don't hesitate to buy this book.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|As a whole is very good. Some scenes are silly, like talking Spok<br />with itself in the future. But stand it ...
B00D7NRHX0|5.0|Even tho I have been waiting for my TV provider to carry this they still do not have it so I went on here to find it!  I think it was a great movie and a good price for it as well!  I recommend this to any scifi junkies like my self!

031603441X|1.0|I like some Rolling Stones songs, and I understand that the band is considered to be one of the greatest of all time, but Keith Richards is no Jimi Hendrix. What's annoying is that he views himself as one of the greatest guitar players of all time. I'm not sure he'd even make the top 50. He even admits -- repeatedly -- that he ripped off African American acoustic and electric blues guitar players. As other reviewers have noted, Richards's detailed descriptions of his drug abuse got old really fast. Also, his views of black people seem really patronizing and borderline racist.
B00FEHXISA|4.0|the movie is great, never expected this from IRON MAN. the acting is superb. welcome AIM to Avengers plot. hoping to see the next episode from Avengers.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|This is a story of courage, faith, a love of family and homeland and an unquenchable thirst for education in a young girl, who is an inspiration for all of us. I had heard of Malala's quest for education for girls before she was shot and have followed her story since. I saw her interviewed by Jon Stewart on The Daily Show. He asked her what her father would think about him adopting her. I was wondering the same thing. In the book, she sees children scavenging a large rubbish pile and is concerned about their lives. She wants to bring them home, but her house is already filled with people receiving aid from her family. So she writes God a letter about the children and then sends the letter with such an innocence of faith. Thank you, Malala, for sharing your story with us, and godspeed on your life's journey and your quest for education for all children.
B00EH0K9H8|1.0|Big THUMBS DOWN to Mascot for releasing a Blu-Ray formatted B/2 to US customers!<br />I pre-ordered this the day it became available and have been looking forward to it and it does not play in my PS3.<br /><br />Mascot says they'll have a fix in 2 weeks? Ok, great. How do AMAZON customers get it? They need to address this issue fast or I will probably just return the disk and forget about it.

Someone else commented that this is the wrong format for the USA but Radiant Records claims that both Blu-ray and DVD are region free.<br /><br />Update: The manufacturer (Mascot Label Group @ [...] claims that the Blu-ray does not work with many older Sony and Panasonic Blu-ray players. I have both the BDP-18 and the BDP-S370, it doesn't work in either. They say they are correcting the problem and will have new pressing within two weeks.

B00EUS9IBU|4.0|Believe it or not, Paul McCartney has released a new studio album. The album, New, is McCartney’s first album since last year’s Kisses On The Bottom, which saw McCartney taking on American standards. So this makes New McCartney’s first studio album of all original material since 2007’s Memory Almost Full. McCartney, now 71, has made an album that sounds very modern but also reminiscent of his work with the Beatles, Wings and his solo career.<br /><br /> For this album, McCartney decided to do something interesting: for each song, they are produced by either one of four producers- Giles Martin (son of Beatles producer, George Martin), Ethan Johns, Mark Ronson and Paul Epworth. This is an interesting move for McCartney since it’s not common for someone like him to have multiple producers. Still, the final product is impressive.<br /><br /> The album opens with “Save Us”, a fuzz guitar-driven rock song. The song is pretty catchy while McCartney sounds fine. It’s no lie: McCartney’s voice has seen better days but for what he can pull off at his age is remarkable. “Alligator” is a bouncy track with slightly whimsical lyrics while a song like “On My Way To Work” is somewhat autobiographical. “On my way to work/I rode a big green bus” McCartney sings. “I could see everything/From the upper deck/People came and went/Smoking cigarettes.” The acoustic dominating “Early Days” is another autobiographical song, in which McCartney recalls the days of his youth with his “hair slicked back with Vaseline” and visiting the local record shops.<br /><br /> Even at 71, McCartney still delivers with great pop songs. “Queenie Eye” is very catchy bopping pop tune as is the self-titled track, which is the lead single from the album. The latter is a personal favorite; as it sounds surprisingly much like something the Beatles would’ve done in the mid to late 1960s (“Penny Lane” comes to mind).  “I Can Bet” yet another catchy tune that sounds like something he would’ve made with Wings except modernized with voice effects and electronics. McCartney even knows how to end an album with class- the piano line in “Road” brings back memories of the piano heard in “Nineteen Hundred Eighty Five” from Band On The Run. There’s even a hidden track called “Scared”, similar to how “Her Majesty” is a hidden track from Abbey Road.<br /><br /> New is a surprisingly good album from Paul McCartney. I’m quite impressed. I would go as far to saying this is his first solid album since 2005’s Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, in which all of the songs are good. If you’re a fan of McCartney, I don’t see why you shouldn’t have the album already.

B00FAEPX9Y|4.0|The &#34;sound&#34; of Lorde is fresh.  The arrangements and production on this recording are excellent and really can take you places as a listener.  The singing is extraordinary and compliments the arrangements well.  Unfortunately the lyrics don't deliver on what the sonic experience promises.  But hey everyone can't be Bob Dylan.  Overall this is a great record and well worth buying.
B008U3NU38|2.0|No, I am not buying this box set for what it is currently selling.  I don't need any bells and whistles.  I'm not 13 years old and I wasn't 13 when I saw The Clash for the first time in San Francisco (London Calling Tour @ The Warfield Theater, April 1980, IIRC).  So, do I care about the music or some decals, a poster and a couple of fanzines?  Take a guess!  So, essentially, if I want the 3 CDs of demos, 'rarities' and B-sides and the DVD, I am supposed to pay an additional $135 above for what I can get the remastered 5 studio albums?  I don't think so!  I don't need a 'cool box' and some miscellaneous crap that I will save until . . . . until I decide it's nothing but crap and throw it out.  Yes, I would love to hear the 3 CDs of unreleased song and watch the DVD, but I'm not willing to get ripped off because Mick Jones can use the extra money.<br /><br />I might have been born at night, but I wasn't born last night!!  Go straight to hell Mick!  I'm buying the remastered studio albums and will use my savings of $135 on something that 'really matters'.<br /><br />Oops!  I forgot to mention that you get really cool badges too. ;->
0385737955|2.0|i tried reading this book, but i guess since i was trying to force myself to finish it i couldnt really get into it - im going to try and give it another go, once i have caught up to my other series

B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I was fascinated when I heard about Shin on the news so I bought this book. I've never heard of such cruelty. As, I read this book I am travelling in Cambodia. I just saw the killing fields and again I have never known of cruelty on such a mass scale.everyone should read this book and learn to be more compassionate because we did not suffer such horrors.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is a fantastic story!  I loved it, full of romance, twist and turns you do not expect, and some humor too,<br />and for me it hit home a few times as to how I guard myself because of my past experiences in love.<br />This book tells both sides of the story where love and feelings are concerned...<br />What a well written book this is!  A page turner too, keeps your interest through out to the end.<br /><br />I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ONE AND ALL............<br />Happy reading Ya'll..............
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|My husband and I have played with this app a little and we like what we've seen so far. The learning isn't too fast or too slow. It made it easy to practice the phrases we wanted to learn.

B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book based on the up coming movie Enders Game November 2013. This is the first book I ever rated a five star read. The Book is not written for children. It's very adult oriented. These are kid's with the mind's of presidents, CEOs, Achilles of Troy, general's of great battles.<br />The opposite of Star Trek and Star Wars but with a morbid twists. Not what you would expect. A Good Read none the less. Remember these books are a series when you get to the end. Can you smell part-2, 3 & 4.<br />I'm Hooked despite the critics of the series.

B0061JPYX2|4.0|I was writing this review when a friend of mine called me. I told him I'm writing a review for an album of previously unreleased material by Amy Winehouse. \\"Amy Winehouse?\\" He repeated the name in an interrogative tone. I said: Why not? Sometimes I really have to get out from my comfort zone and give other singers a chance to be heard in order to appreciate their talent. One such singer was Amy Winehouse whom I believe had a great talent that was interrupted too soon due to her untimely death. With her stylish vocal art and had she completely and wholeheartedly focused a hundred percent on jazz, she could have been a remarkable modern-day-jazz-diva.<br /><br />\\"How did you hear about that recording?\\" My friend asked me.<br /><br />It was played as background music in my Pilates class at the gym some weeks ago. At the start of the class and as the music begins to play, I have no clue who the singer was but I was listening with intent and was very impressed with the first track, \\"Our Day Will Come\\" and the succeeding songs--\\"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow\\" and \\"The Girl From Ipanema.\\" I asked myself: \\"Who is this singer?\\" I can't recognize her voice but she surely sounded very good on the aforementioned songs. It was only on the 11th track that I realized it was Amy Winehouse. How could I know when I didn't really explore her music? After the class, I asked my Pilates instructor the title of the CD which she gladly informed me: \\"Lioness/Hidden Treasures.\\"<br /><br />When Tony Bennett's \\"Duets II\\" was released in September of 2011, it was only then that I had the chance to listen to her on one of the very best tracks in that album, \\"Body And Soul,\\" which is also one of the best in this album that was released in December of 2011, five months after her premature death. Upon hearing it for the first time in \\"Duets II,\\" I thought she was obviously trying to sound like Billie Holiday but she was just creating her own vocal styling in jazz. I am really blown away with the outcome of the duet with Tony Bennett. Both of them--as a pair--did an exceptional rendition of this classic standard. And to top it all, she was very confident singing with the living legend and musical icon. This track was recorded at Abbey Road Studios, London in March of 2011. It is so special and memorable because it was her very last and final studio recording.

B00A4EDAN6|5.0|i have all the Tegan And Sara albums...<br />This is definitely the best one yet...<br />Can stop listening to them, in my room, my car, gym...basically everywhere!
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|I really enjoyed reading something different from my favorite author. Steelheart is an easy read, full of good action and likable characters. BUT, I feel like it would have been better had it been written in third person. We are limited by the POV character and so get no explanation as to what Calamity is. I had hoped to discover something by the end, but was slightly disappointed. This is why I gave only 4 stars. I feel like this new world has so much potential. I'm confident Brandon will improve in the next one.
B007PTJOV0|2.0|This was an alright game.  I was not a fan of it.  I got bored way too quickly and lost interest.
B0065UF2ZM|4.0|The usual high standard production from Michael Connelly. Tightly written, good plot and the twist at the end.<br />Keeps you in the story right to the end.<br />Very good read.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Another winner by Ms. Burnett.  Have this one as a real book but again this version is easier to take with me.
B00867HDTA|5.0|Great game with pretty solid graphics. I love the variety of game types available and the higher levels are tricky enough to keep me interested. Very simple idea executed perfectly.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Incredible story story based on true events in US history. It speaks to the determination of the human spirit to adapt and rise above the unfortunate circumstances that other humans tried to capitalize on without regard to the societal conditions which spawned the necessity  for Orphan Trains.
039916409X|5.0|This book has already guided me through some steps and excercises that showed me some blocks and attitudes I hadn't really realized. I have only just started, but excited to get down to the nitty gritty. I have used tapping for other things (like depression) but never thought of it for something as specific as money! It shows how our programming really affects this area and gives specific scripts and examples to guide you through the process. I can't wait to implement everything in this book.
B004X75RCW|5.0|It is nice to watch a movie that has some fun,romance and a great story! Sandra Bullock is wonderful in this movie!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game to play at the end of the day.  I play it almost every day.<br />I would recommend this game to everyone.
B006IGZX0C|5.0|Loved this movie! The actors were sensational along with the 60s surroundings. This is one you can invite the kids to watch also.
B009ZQP42E|5.0|I love this movie. The humor is amazing and the storyline of never give up is given a twist. Gotta love the English
0060594896|5.0|The price was great as was the condition of the book. It was referred to me and is a very inspirational book. It makes you want to take action but it's a lengthy book. Thankfully it's an easy read.
B002C4PWD2|2.0|It was recommended to me.  But, I really don't like this type of movie.  Enjoyed the surround sound and effects.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I chose my rating because Stephen King has done it again. It Isn't often a writer can reprise a character and get it just right, but Stephen King has in this book. I loved that he made Dan T a recovering alcoholic. It was the perfect way to write him. I loved how he made Abra' s gift so much stronger than Dan's who's<br />was so much stronger than Rick Hollarran' s. This was a perfect Stephen King book!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Pretty damn good<br />I loved it, even better than the shining, and I'm glad at where Danny is at in his life
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I both liked and disliked the slowly revealed relationship between Charlie and his aunt Helen. The story kept my interest.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the most amazing game ever.I love to play it! My nice loves it too! Everyday all day! And I love the movie so yeah
B0038NN3B4|5.0|As someone with insulin resistance, this book is invaluable.<br />Carbs are responsible for the majority of the insulin response and the resulting metabolic syndrome.<br />If you have been told you have insulin resistance or are pre-diabetic, this diet is perfect for you.
B00ECTZKJ6|4.0|I've been listening to Korn ever since i first started getting into industrial music, and this album is a return to their roots. Korn's last album (Path Of Totality) was a HUGE disappointment to me, so i was somewhat skeptical when purchasing this one. I, however, am extremely pleased by it. This album defines aggression. From the angry vocals, to the crushing guitars, to the signature bass riffs, this album is everything that i have come to love from Korn. The top 3 tracks that stand out to me the most are:<br /><br />1.Love & Meth<br />2.Pray For Me<br />3.Never Never<br /><br />with honorable mentions going to Victimized. I also purchased the deluxe version of the album that includes 2 bonus tracks, a bonus DVD, and \\"free\\" T-Shirt offer. The bonus tracks didn't overly impress me, as i felt that they were OK at best. The \\"free\\" t-shirt offer didn't do much for me either, seeing as how you have to pay for the shipping still (which for me is close to $20).<br /><br />Overall, i give The Paradigm Shift a thumbs up, and recommend it to anyone, ESPECIALLY the original die-hard fans who were disappointed by the previous album. However, i would say to pass on the deluxe edition and go for the standard to save a few bucks.
B001QB5S3G|3.0|I watched this movie for a Graduate School class. It was interesting and the acting was okay. I would not watch it again most likely.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I am addicted to puzzles and love this app it is lots of fun and very relaxing.  I don't need to worry about finding space or my cats spreading the pieces all over the house or even losing any of them
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This bingo game is very fun to play.I.have been playing for about a year, and it is still a fun game to play everyday.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|My husband wanted to watch this, so I acquiesced.  He fell asleep, as usual on a Friday night, but I really enjoyed it!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie was very funny and sweet. All ages can enjoy this movie. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|boy things have changed they have wireless connection... love this item Wish it used 3G/  right from phone to tablet
B00908DDZM|5.0|i am a college student on a tight budget. I bought this CD in respects of the artist and what he stands for. If you are an individual that is interested in intellectual music that is going to make you think than this is right for you. I recommend this CD to anyone who is interested in hip-hop/rap. Great quality music at a affordable price.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It makes me very creative. I LOVE IT! My favorite game EVER! The app is like survival craft! A.K.A cool game
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game!  I just wish the bingo credits would always get returned when the screen froze.. but otherwise it seriously is an addictive & great game to kill time anywhere
B00FF56IR4|4.0|This is a great show, and has a lot of potential. Joss Whedon always does a fantastic job, and he's done it again! Okay, what it's missing: I know this is called \\"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\\", but I want to see SUPERHEROES. That's right, SUPERHEROES. I am such a sucker for Marvel, and all the SUPERHEROES that come along with it, and this show has hardly ANY! Ugh! I do like it, but they need to bring in some heroes and either put them as a bad guy, make them apart of S.H.I.E.L.D, or just make them a main character for God's sake! I WANT SUPERHEROES, AND I'M NOT GETTING THEM! Hopefully, they come up in future episodes.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|I was surprised to find some covers and somewhat funny songs on this album, kind of expected from FFDP, I recommend this album if you like the band.
0762451319|5.0|It is small but, It was better than I expected!!! The necklace fits perfectly! I'm very pleased with this purchase:)
193700788X|1.0|Unfortunately I tend to get hooked on a series and have to find out how it ends. Thankfully this one is over. Should have stopped after book 3 but like I said. I have a problem.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I really missed these people and was so pleased to visit them again. But now I wonder when the nastys will be back to make trouble. I love the universe Stephen King and his son Joe have built for us. I wish it were real ....or maybe not.

B00005M989|5.0|Thanks to Amazon for being able to get old Prince cds again! Real Music! I look forward to getting more of my old favorites soon!
B003TTKB5I|3.0|Ending is very stupid, they end up killing most of the main characters, kind of idiotic in my opinion. Good luck.
0316219266|5.0|In the early 2000s the landscape was littered with the carcasses of dotcom darlings gone sour. And yet Amazon found a way to keep on going - surviving, then thriving, then dominate as it does today, in an industry with razor-thin margins. Was it just the will of one man? Was he just smarter and harder working than almost everyone else? I think this book says both yes and no. It was these things plus timing, luck, excellent publicity, incredibly savvy recruiting, and a willingness to be wrong while continually trying new things and revising the model using chains of little advantages. Relentless.com indeed! I think Brad Stone has really captured the nature of what make Jeff Bezos and Amazon.com tick, the narrative fallacy aside. A must-read for any startup founder, or someone who is considering becoming one.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|The author takes you through what it takes to become a SEAL, then plunges you into the battlefield where you gain an understanding of the &#34;why&#34; behind all the training.  Incredible account of American heroes doing what they do best, fighting Americas battles.
B00DJZR46G|5.0|I am happiest while immersed in music.  Music is not simply a joy for me, I need good music.  &#34;The Diving Board&#34; has exceeded my expectations.  This is a great album.  Back when Elton published &#34;Philidelphia Freedom&#34; I got musical heartburn, and I haven't really listened much to him since then.  But I have been waiting for him to emerge from behind his glasses and give us the gift of his talent (I heard the promise of that great talent to come, in Madman).  I understand good and great musicians continually change directions and styles, but Elton's music became, well, boring and painful for me to listen to.<br /><br />When I began listening to this collaboration with Bernie Taupin I felt such bliss!  I think this album is as close to perfection as possible.  The production is, perhaps deceptively, simple, with Elton's voice and piano the focus of all of the songs.  His VOICE!  I haven't read any critical reviews so I do not know, but his voice is amazing and I would not be surprised if he had taken voice lessons to improve his range and preserve his voice.  Yes, he has an amazing talent, but there is nothing wrong with education at genius level.  Whatever, his voice is gorgeous and has a range and richness new to me.  I love this Elton John.<br /><br />I started listening to Elton John with &#34;Madman Across the Water,&#34; probably still know every line from &#34;Yellow Brick Road&#34; (a gift for my 18th birthday), but pretty much dismissed him, as I wrote earlier, after &#34;Philadelphia Freedom.&#34;  I am SO glad I found Elton again, and I am doubly glad Elton has rediscovered himself.  I too bought this at the same time as Sting's new album, but haven't listened to Sting's album yet.  I want to listen to &#34;the Diving Board&#34; over and over for a while, until I know the words and music by heart.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|So coolif you have a tablet or phone. Doesn't work with Chrome OS yet. It does display web pages on Chrome OS. For a PC it must be on wireless. Smooth playback with no queue problems. Easy setup and easy control.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|Sorry she lost Darcy but you know in real life things happen.  The book was so Bridget. Hopefully the next book will be a put step-parenting. This is the new family, blended. Looking forward to more funny,quirky  Bridget who makes me laugh out loud!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Fun game, although frustrating at times. Takes forever to complete. I would recommend playing this if you like bingo and you have patience.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so much fun. Even my four year old d a lighter loves it. Wish they had more like it
B007EECSFA|4.0|This is an intriguing read from the very beginning, with easy leaps back and forth in time.  Katrina Morton is a master story teller.  My favorite of the year.
B00F91H15W|2.0|The plot is almost non-existent and you don't learn anything about these characters after the first 5 minutes. I'm not one that gets squeamish over foul language, but the amount in this movie was just over the top. I thought the actors did a fine job; it's just a shame they weren't given better material to work with.
B00D23GXB2|4.0|Revenge of the Orgasm is a book of poetry. But this poetry is unlike any that I have ever read before. This is erotic poetry. It is hot and steamy poetry.<br />The poems in this collection tell stories with such detail and feeling. Some of the poems really take your breath away. My personal favorite is \\"Fog\\". It is one of the shorter poems, but the imagery is unbelievable. I give this book of poems a solid 4 stars and recommend it!

B00E5Q1HJS|2.0|This was a disappointment. I'm giving it two stars because I loved the first movie. The actors just couldn't seem to capture the same chemistry in this one. The creators should have written a new and original story but they didn't. I need a new story to be entertained, or a rework of an original that is cool. This movie, however, was disappointing! Let's hope the third one rocks!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great app to play when you have some spare time. You get so involved in taking care of your horse and the competitions are FUN to win!
B00A0SLTCU|4.0|This was much better than I expected. Collin does a great job! Story-line is pretty much conceptually identical to the original, but the futuristic sci-fi environment is very cool. Really well done, and very entertaining.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is awesome it has really easy and really hard levels and both combined I don't even know why I am wasting my time rating a game I never even downloaded
B00DCX08MW|4.0|This is a great app and lots of fun but at the end of the campaign, there is no end!  You succesfully crash land your plane, get captured and well, thats it. Over and over. If there is a way to complete this, would someone please let me know! Or maybe Rortos is waiting to add that in an update....sneaky Rortos! Get this app and have some fun!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|While not nearly as scary as The Shining, the sequel comes as quite a relief!! I can't begin to explain how or why, but it's always a great feeling you share with someone, even a fictional character, when they face their demons and emerge victorious. The story kept me entranced until the very end as most of King 's stories always have. Highly recommend!!!
B00A8ECU24|2.0|Love this game, my daughter play it until the battery goes dead. Parents have to be careful that your child does not drain your bank account, it is not fair that you have to pay hundreds just to get a virtual pony. Gameloft, please make this ponies cheaper, it will be more enjoyable for adults, you will also get better reviews.
1451648545|5.0|Book is the authoritative account of the life of Steve Jobs.  Very factual and detailed information.  I learned more about this genius than I thought I would before starting this book. Great work!
B004L35GAQ|5.0|I discovered Sail at the beginning of &#34;Disconnect&#34; (totally recommended movie of 2012) and then I just couldn´t stop enjoying a rare lyric/rythm/arrangements´type of band. I then youtubed their live concerts in LA and you can clearly see Bruno & Co. will be true music stars. Hope they keep true to their roots and special gift.
0345530578|4.0|I bought two when I lost the first one. Not a Ken Follett but a darn good read. I read every new John Grisham book.
0440539811|1.0|Unlike some reviewers who gave this one star, I did find *some* redeemable qualities in this trilogy...but only one star's worth. I found several scenes, lines, and in-jokes/cultural allusions pretty funny and clever, and I wasn't bothered by the graphic sex and violence scattered throughout this tome (some people are way too sensitive). The problem is that this book is very frustrating to read, it felt like work, and it wasn't rewarding in the end. These are my reasons:<br /><br />1. I could not become invested in any of the characters. Not a single one. The story shifts from one scene to another in consecutive paragraphs, or after only a few paragraphs at a time, so often that you hardly get to know any of the characters or care about what they are doing and why. Frequently, a character was brought up all of a sudden, either for the first time or even for the second or third or fourth time, and I had no idea who they were, where the scene was taking place, what the character was doing, or why I should care about any of that. In the end, I realized I didn't. The only two characters who came close to producing an ounce of interest in me were Goodman and Muldoon, when they were investigating the bombing at the beginning of the book and reading through the \\"Illuminati Project\\" notes, but they appear so infrequently and do so little that I couldn't maintain my interest in them.<br /><br />2. I did not find the plot clever or interesting. It is also so scattered, disjointed, and rambling, with so much unnecessary stream-of-consciousness-type information, that the few redeeming qualities of the plot are lost, or at least dampened, amid the irrelevant sea of crap. I expected that a worldwide, millennia-old conspiracy to control the world (or do something, anything), involving the participation of famous heroes and villains throughout history, would be interesting and subversive, but it's just annoying, mundane, and kind of a little obnoxious. I haven't read any Dan Brown books or seen the movies based on them (because I refuse to reward that d-bag by giving him my money), but the conspiracy-laden plots of his books do sound kind of interesting, clever, and intricate. I guess I expected the Illuminatus! trilogy to live up to those expectations, but it didn't. It's hard to even pinpoint why, but one good example (no spoilers) is the revelation of the identity of the fifth Illuminatus Primi. The Illuminati's conspiracy is so ridiculous, so outlandish, so uninteresting, and so contrived, and I had waded through so many hundreds of pages of fruitless confusion, that I just didn't care at that point. I didn't care who it was or why they had joined the Illuminati. This ties into my point #1 above: I didn't care who the fifth Primi was, and I didn't care about the consequences of that revelation to the story that I had just read or to the future of this fictional world.<br /><br />3. The writing/storytelling style is not effective. Yes, I get what the Roberts were going for. Yes, I understand they had a purpose in structuring it that way. It still wasn't effective for me.<br /><br />4. The story and its world did not feel *real* to me. I mainly read science fiction and fantasy, and the most important thing a sci-fi/fantasy author can do is immerse the reader in the world (or worlds, or universe, or universes) of the story, making you feel like that world is real, and the characters are real, and that everything in the story not only *could* happen but *has* happened or *will* happen, and that what happens is important because it has consequences for real people and places. I felt the exact opposite reading this book. I wanted the Illuminati to achieve whatever plan they had been scheming just so *something* would happen and have an actual effect on people. I didn't believe any of the conspiracies or schemes or fake histories or fake biographies because it was written so unsympathetically and haphazardly that none of it felt real, or even realistic. I wanted most of the characters to die or at least go away forever after reading a few scenes about them, especially Simon Moon and Joe Malik.<br /><br />5. This book did not make me \\"think\\", expand my mind, open my mind up to new possibilities, encourage me to question anything, or change the way I think about anything. I already am as skeptical as I can be and already do question all forms of authority and power that exist in this world. (That's another reason I was drawn to this book initially: its supposed socio-political ideas that meshed with mine fairly well.) If you need a rambling, disjointed acid trip of a conspiracy novel to make you do those things, then you need to read more. A LOT more.<br /><br />I had a lot of hope for this book. It had so much potential, due to its reputation as a subversive, funny, wild, fun book with contrarian political messages and a semi-realistic portrayal (and integration) of every conspiracy theory known to man, that I plodded all the way to the end, hoping it would get better or pay off. It just didn't. Not for me, anyway. It was a waste of my time. The writing style doesn't change, the characters don't become interesting, and the \\"conspiracy\\" never meanders its way to anything interesting or clever. Only weird. If it were a short book that took only a weekend to read, then it would be equally awful but not nearly as big a waste of time. Its pointlessness combined with its length make it one of my least favorite books. I should have followed my instincts and stopped reading after a couple hundred pages.<br /><br />If you haven't read the Illuminatus! trilogy and you only read one part of my review, I hope it's this: Read as much of this book as you can in the bookstore, the library, or a friend's copy before you buy it. Fifty or sixty pages ought to be plenty. If you like the writing/storytelling style and are engaged at that point, then you might like it. If you don't like how it's written and aren't invested in any of the characters, then you won't like the rest of the book because it doesn't get any better.alistic.

He answers all questions and and manages to eliminate any and all confusion.

B00DU74U74|4.0|not bad, fun to watch, the title of this post says everything.  The visuals are strange and nicely done. The story itself is not as good as the setting of the story.  But, a date that dislikes science fiction might like it a lot, so, go for it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read each book seperately - Wool had me hooked from the first sentence throught the epilogue, Hugh Howey's story telling carried me along,  with every twist and turn of the staircase.  I emerged from the silo gasping for more! Please don't ever stop writing!
B000LC3ID8|5.0|It was funny because me and my sister were at home and they UPS guy knocks on the door. I opened it and there before me was the UPS guy with my package... well a big box and a dvd package. He gave me the box. I ordered multiple items, so I thought my items were together. As soon as the UPS guy left I ripped that box open while my sister came in the room to see what I bought. We then we discovered it was medical things. I sat back in embarrassment as a knock was heard at the door. I opened it not more than 10 seconds before the UPS guy first came and he stood there with my SAW III DVD and I apologized and we switched packages and left and I stood there thinking, \\"How embarrassing... he was was gone maybe no longer than five seconds and the box was all torn up and me and my sister around the box like little kids. Pretty embarrassing. Great movie.
B004LWZW24|1.0|I love a good creepy, scary movie. After The Conjuring (which I liked) I read that Insidious is also worth seeing. So we settled in with the curtains drawn and candles on, ready to be spooked. But this was just your average, bad, boring concept, cheap scares with loud music &#34;tadaaas&#34; and cheesy ghoasts.<br />Glad I only paid a few bucks for it, but it will definitely go to Goodwill.
B004LQI0HE|2.0|DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE THE PLOT THE CLIMAX AND THE OVERALL THEME OF THE MOVIE BESIDES THE OBVIOUS HOW WOLD THIS PLAY OUT IN A BOOK AND WHY HAVE THE OTHER PEOPLE DIED.
081099741X|4.0|Wes Anderson fetishists will be delighted with this book. It's so well done. The attention to design detail in his movies is well-replicated in this volume. A must-have for any fan, or anyone that enjoys unique books.<br /><br />I pre-ordered this volume and found that the back pages and cover had distinct heat warpage. I ordered a replacement immediately. The replacement had a long delivery time, but was revised so that I received it a week later. The replacement also has a slight wave to the back pages when it's closed flat. I suspect that it may be a binding issue, but it's not evident at all when reading the book or when it's on the shelf. I wonder if anyone else received books in this condition.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|As usual a difficult book to put down.  And as usual you definitely do not mess with Reacher or his friends and live. Lots of dead men walking.  Just the way I like it.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I could not put this book down. I started it for a book club meeting next month, planning a leisurely read, but read the entire book in a week. Vivian's story was grippingly painful intertwined with small moments of joy. My heart ached for her suffering and I was indignant over her treatment and by extension the treatment of all those innocent children. I had heard of the orphan trains but had no idea of the details prior to reading this book.  The parallel of Molly's story and their connection was heart warming. At least fate brought them together to save each other.
039916409X|5.0|Margaret's tapping videos and scripts have helped us go from a few thousands dollars each month in our business to a record breaking $9k last month alone, plus allow more brilliant ideas for easily generating additional streams of profit. Without her guidance, I'm not sure that we'd be nearly as successful. I can't wait to see what she'll 'download from the Universe' next!
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Brandon Sanderson is the best fantasy writer out there right now, and you can't go wrong with any of his books!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is a story with depth, that goes through several generations with characters whom circumstances drove to live in different countries. The story begins deceptively simple in Afghanistan but is really entertaining and recommended if one wants to read something that leaves an imprint. There is romance, suffering, acceptance, at a level which not that many books tackle, as the characters belong to simple walks of life.  If you liked &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; and &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34; you will like this book
B002M9WW30|5.0|I love old movies and I especially love them on blu-ray, they last longer. The picture quality of these films was updated however, don't expect a crystal clear blu-ray image they feel more like high quality DVD transferred onto a blu-ray. However, that doesn't mean the films look bad.
B00F9040HU|1.0|every time I try to open this on the kindle, it partially boots and then wont open to the game, but closes out. Don't waste your time.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|After much Amazon comparison shopping, I chose these headphones due to the reviews--and I'm glad I did. The sound is natural, and while the bass is not pronounced, I like hearing music as it was recorded. They are extremely comfortable; I can leave them on for hours with no problems. They seem to be made well of good materials. Highly recommend!
B00881VLCE|3.0|This used to be my favorite app but since, the past couple of updates, it either force closes or its very slow. I would give it a 5 star rating if it worked right.
B005OGS854|5.0|I enjoyed this movie though I do wish steven Spielberg would quit centering his movies around kids. just a thought.
0385351399|5.0|THE CIRCLE is a fever dream of a novel about an individual at a tech behemoth, about the sinister undertones of our best intentions, and about the conflicting expectations on our public/professional and private selves.<br /><br />Mae, a woman fresh out of college in a dead-end job is given an opportunity to work for Google, I mean Amazon, sorry Facebook, no, it's the fictitious Circle. On this gleaming campus she starts in consumer relations, answering customer queries and seeking their feedback on her responses. Here the query/feedback snowball starts its long tumble from the top of the hill and threatens to become an avalanche as the book progresses.<br /><br />As she makes satisfying progress at work and in her love life, Mae is steadily pressured to surrender privacy for the sake of her Circle community and to surrender autonomy in exchange for health insurance for her parents. The logic with which these decisions are made is both reasonable and appalling.<br /><br />THE CIRCLE's plot rushes predictably along but still keeps you off balance. The characters are helplessly blind to the implications of their decisions and often unable to interpret what they see directly in front of them (an art installation, a shark metaphor, a man's identity when he disguises himself by taking off his hat). The end seems both easily avoidable and utterly inevitable. It's maddening. It's fantastic.<br /><br />As for the Circle, the fictional company -- Eggers has been ridiculed for it's implausibility. But in my mind we're one major tech merger away from something like it. Or, just look to the NSA for a government equivalent.<br /><br />All told, this is a book you won't want to put down. But once you do finish, you'll absolutely need to talk about.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is now one of my favorite books. I couldn't put it down it made me laugh and cry. I just love how she wrote this story. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone..

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love this little gadget. The ability to stream movies and YouTube wirelessly is awesome! If you ever want to stream your own movies from your PC to your TV use Plex.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Definitely enjoy the layout and game type. However, I don't know how I feel about being restricted on the amount of searches I can perform on a given playthrough. I'm allowed 3 tries in the beginning whether I do good or not. Needs to be improved a little there. Otherwise, solid game.
0812550706|4.0|I'm not done just yet but told my mom and sister that they should read this. It's by an LDS author and its creative and a fast read.
0811869261|5.0|My 2 yr old runs straight to this book every single day, yelling \\"Mouk!\\"  It's like a more beautiful Where's Waldo...but has been key in his increased vocabulary.  He loves looking at what each character is doing, and pointing out little things he recognizes.  There are small bits of humor in there, and the illustrations are just spot-on.  We absolutely love this gem of a book.
B005K17RU0|3.0|The widget is nice for the desktop on your android tablet or phone.  The app is nice except they update the screen layout from time to time after you get use to the one you like and the adds are somewhat in the way so if you tap where you want to go, sometimes you'll &#34;add click&#34;.  It's slow in loading and always tries to &#34;locate you&#34; even if you do not want the GPS function active.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|My opinion on Malcolm Gladwell's book success depends on what topic he decides to cover.<br /><br />I also do not expect an \\"academic\\" read when I read his books.  He admits to writing for more of a general audience, and yes, he offers a fairly \\"one-sided\\" discussion in many of his books.  This is to create discussion surrounding the book itself.<br /><br />You don't have to agree with Gladwell to enjoy reading his books, and that is why he is one of my favorite authors.  He gets you thinking differently about the world.<br /><br />This particular book, David and Goliath, generally covers the \\"little guy\\" ... the underdog ... and our obsession with \\"prestige\\" and \\"advantages.\\"<br /><br />He opens the book with the very story in the title, and it has a minor twist at the end of that first story.<br /><br />This book is a solid read, but isn't his best, mainly because of the way he structures his arguments, they aren't quite as strong, and this book doesn't quite \\"change\\" the way I thought about the topic he covered.<br /><br />He did better with Blink, and The Tipping Point, IMO.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|What an amazing true story and very well written. Makes you want to find a veteran's hand to shake and just say thank you to.
1781162646|4.0|I'm a huge Stephen King fan and have never disliked any of his books that I've read. This one's no exception. It was my beach read this summer. The story moved quickly; the plot line wasn't &#34;deep,&#34; but the way King's narrator engages the reader with a casual, conversational, but gifted-storyteller voice is a treat -- as usual. The end was anticlimactic, though, so I gave this book only 4 stars.
B003WE9TU8|4.0|Seen the Film before I knew there was a book loved both good read.<br />very enjoyable book<br />liked it a lot
B00DYEBM2Y|5.0|If I may chime in on the previous discussions as to the vinyl format of this great (17 year hiatus) release - I ordered a copy from Amazon.com and the first copy I received had major noise issues on the vinyl - I could even see the visual 'distortion' on the grooves themselves - I asked for a replacement copy - perfect - no surface noise and much more depth as vinyl will always have over CD - kudos to Amazon for a great customer experience - I have listened to vinyl for about 30 years now and was around when pressing plants were hi tech and pressed hundreds of thousands of copies, and more recently, when only about 50,000 are pressed - quality control is not the top priority now...ironic in light of the fact that they are now pressing much fewer copies and the quality  potentially decreases overall ---- I say if you get a good pristine pressing of this Mazzy Star LP  hang onto it because I doubt they will do another pressing...
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games is definitely a must read. It is a science fiction/fantasy book for ages 11 and up. 4. The Hunger Games is set in a post-apocalyptic world where North America has been destroyed and is now Panem, which consists of a wealthy Capitol and twelve poor districts. In order to keep the poor districts from rebelling, every year, the Capitol randomly selects one boy and girl from each district to compete in a televised fight to the death called the Hunger Games. When Katniss Everdeen's younger sister Prim is selected to compete, Katniss volunteers to take her place. The story follows Katniss and the male \\"tribute\\" from her district, Peeta, as they struggle to survive the Hunger Games. 7. I really like The Hunger Games. It is a science fiction book that I enjoy because of the elaborate details, the crazy events, and the unique writing. Katniss is the epitome of a female protagonist. She is strong and capable, which makes her a great role model for teenage girls. I look forward to reading Catching Fire and Mockingjay.
0812973992|4.0|This book was not an easy read, as at times I found the wandering point of view a bit of a distraction, but I must admit that McCann is a wonderful writer. I found myself re-reading some of the sentences he constructed, because they were so beautifully composed. By the end of the book, I admired the way the story had unfolded, as the connections between the people in NYC whose lives were described all ended up coming together in such a riveting way. Of course, there were certain parts of the book I liked better, with a few of the characters shining while others faded to the background. To me the tightrope walker didn't really seem like an important part of the book, rather if this story is about anything, it's about a hooker named Jazzlyn and all of the people whose lives collided because of her life, and her eventual death. All in all, I thought it was an eye opening read that I will recommend to anyone who would enjoy a book that is not so much 'easy reading' but rather a novel that is complex, enthralling and mystical.
B002ITWSUQ|5.0|This is my go-to feel good movie.  I love it.  I defy anyone to watch and not feel cheerier at the end.  :)
039916409X|5.0|I have been a long time fan of Margaret's work.  She has great tools for shifting your relationship with money and with yourself.  Margaret is easy to relate to, fun and her work is powerful. If you are looking to clear the beliefs and fears that keep you from receiving more money, and more of your true self, I would highly recommend this book.  Thanks Margaret!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Follows the original family in the Shining book, and has lots of twists and turns. As always  read it quickly because it was hard to put down. I grew up on Stephen King, so the Shining was the first horror I knew. Its nice to see the story concluded.
B0063M22QO|3.0|Wish it would orient with the position of the tablet, remember settings between games and freeze the screen when no moves are left instead of kicking you out before you can evaluate what you have done
B00DH4BL8Q|5.0|Why can't every book be like this?! THIS IS THE BEST BOOK SERIES THAT EVER EXISTED IN THE UNIVERSE AND HISTORY!!!!!!!!!!
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|When they describe this as the best 'Iron Man' ever, nothing could be truer! The witty banter is there, the action is there and all wrapped up in a great story line! Action packed from the beginning to end! I will buy this movie to add to my collection.
B00BFV1K0M|4.0|'It is an awesome book, but I would Rate it 5 stars if most of it was hunger games. It also had a few inappropriate for kids' parts! If I was more hunger games without a few inappropriate parts, I would like it.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I highly recommend this book, for people who want to know more about the historical Jesus. That is not the one that most religions and especially the state turn into their cheer leader and under writer!
B007SGM084|5.0|&#60;3 it! Hard to put down! Mr. Grey, Ms. Annasatcia Steel my faves! Can't wait for the movie to come out!
0896898288|5.0|This book is in FAR BETTER shape than this seller said. It is PERFECT  for the application I and my friend plan to use it for. Thanks
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved this book.  King is one of the best.  If you love horror you must read this book.  It is great fun.
B003L77GGK|5.0|VERY TIRED OF HAVING TO DO SO MUCH RATING ON THESE THINGS. I'VE ALREADY RATED ALL OF THESE ALREADY. DAMN !!!
B00F1BFNFA|5.0|Otherwise they could have done a \\"Doctor Who\\" and regenerated Matthew ... or ... since he was in a car accident had his face reconfigured into a different actor. ANYWAY it appears the infant son is the new primary heir and obviously is not going to leave the series anytime soon.<br /><br />I am glad to see that Mrs. O'Brien was given the heave ho and will not be returning ... maybe she is replacing the wicked witch of the west in Oz.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I'VE BEEN WATCHING THIS SHOW SINCE FIRST STARTED. NOW SEASON 6 SUCKED BADLY BUT I THINK IT'S EITHER COMING TO A CLOSE OR THE ORIGINAL WRITER HAS COME BACK BUT I LOVE THIS SHOW. I HAVE ALL SEASON EXCEPT FOR THE NEW ONE OF COURSE.
B00DW1WR14|2.0|Once a great rock band, Pearl Jam has settled into a pattern of retreaded guitar riffs, middling songwriting and FM soft rock theatrics. There's really no reason to revisit this album; it's simply an expression of a band merely existing to pay the bills and to relive the glory days. But we'll always have the live shows and &#34;Vitalogy.&#34;
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I'VE ALREADY DID REVIEWS ON THIS. WHY DO I HAVE TO ALWAYS DO MORE THAT 1? I HATE THIS! TIRED OF THIS NOW
B003XE1DR4|5.0|My Hubby ordered a size 7 M US and and 8 M US to see which one fits me. I wear a size 7 - 71/2 in all my shoes. The 7 was perfect!  The 8 we gave to my Mom and they fit her great!  So I did not have to send a pair back!  We both love these!  They were tight a bit at first but they stretched out some to fit my foot. Everyone complained of the little clip that rubbed your foot on the inside. It did that to mine too but I got used to it and now it does not bother it (feet are used to it now). I did not do anything special to fix it either like some reviewers did.<br /><br />2014- Still love these shoes. My Mom and I wear them to church and everywhere else. They are still comfortable. Only they are wearing out so we both ordered another pair. No problems with the clip rubbing either. Even with the new pair. My 10 year old loves them too so we ordered him some. The kid ones were to wide... so wide I fit them! We had to send them back. He kept sneaking mine on to go out and play so I bought him his own pair and he loves them!  I hope they continue to make these for a VERY long time. If not I will have to order a few pairs this year and save them.
B00BLRXDTQ|2.0|While these movies may have been decent during their year of release for one reason or another (such as pioneering in car filming and stunts), the bulk of these are pretty bad movies with little to like.  The poor acting and odd sounds (from the re-mixing from mono to 5.1) don't help much either.
B00005U11Z|4.0|We all miss Steve Perry as lead singer but this version, Steve Augeri does a great job and looks like Steve Perry.  The drummer Deen is a great energy as well.  Sounds like the original and satisfies.
B005LAIII0|5.0|Great movie and excellent video and sound!  Highly recommend to others as it is very entertaining and thought-provoking.  If your regular fare is more like films titled &#34;Knocked Up&#34; or &#34;Identity Thief&#34;, you may want to pass.
B004RFWZNY|1.0|Not only is this taken from a VHS recording with considerable generation loss, it is also presented in the wrong aspect ratio, in STRETCHED WIDESCREEN! This release is an insult to the band and its fans.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|This set really shines and helps conclude the series is a great way.  Highly recommend to others that are familiar with this series.
B0029LB2V4|4.0|If ever there was a show which demonstrates how absolute power can corrupt this is it. Not a comprehensive history of the Tudors nor is it meant to be it is entertaining even for the non history buff. Though historically inaccurate in some parts the series is non the less very well done.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Contains all of the story relevant musical numbers. Wonderful musical score - passionate singing by actors who understand that the words they are singing are as important as the musical notes.  I listen to this score every day.
B00AQN09VQ|5.0|Thanks to TBS, I was exposed to this series in huge quantities. Although the series lacks story continuity, the series is connected. The six seasons fly by.
1451695195|5.0|I am recommending it to everyone. I saw Eben's interview with Opera and knew I had to read the book. I also saw his interview on &#34;Katie&#34; and was so disappointed because I knew there was so much more to his experience. READ THIS BOOK.
1475143389|5.0|This book has lots of good information, and dispels lots of myths and bad habits that people fall into. After following the relatively simple diet, and exercise plan I've seen improvements in how I feel, look, and am experiencing gains, after being stuck in a rut of sorts for the last few months.<br /><br />The information is presented in straight forward, easy to understand language and is really easy for beginners to pick up. I would recommend this to anyone that isn't happy with the way their results are, or someone that is new to lifting.
0446672653|3.0|It was tooo drawn out..for me. I understand that would be just fine for some searchers but I am already a believer and just wanted..a more condensed story.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Shockingly clear, concise and crisp with a lot of depth in meaning explained beautifully..........<br /><br />A must read in our times
B00CTT9646|3.0|This is another great movie despite the technical flaws and the less than cannon story which is explained away by the \\"alternative reality\\" story line from the first movie.  My only beef is my phaser arrived broken and I can't get a new one.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this as it was recommended to me by a friend post the movie coming out. It's a lovely simple read that has some nice, if obvious, twists
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I wouldn't  say this is the best novel I've eve  read, but it is definitely a good read. It was very confusing for the first few chapters and then everything starts to come together.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I just started playing this game and so far I'm quite pleased. It has great graphics and instructions are very clear and helpful. So far there are no complaints and I look forward to continuing on with this game as well as others by this game creator.

B008469DGY|5.0|I like this game because it is quick, fun, and entertaining.  There is a short learning curve but the game is challenging and by no means easy.  I thing just the right combination of gaming ideas made this a game that not only I enjoy but my 89 year old mother.

030759565X|5.0|Finally,  I am able to make delicious biscuits anytime I am inclined.  Thanks to the author.  Success at last...I have recently spent months trying to make biscuits.  I had the wrong flour, wrong shortening, kneaded too much, too little and always had to buy the frozen kind.

B00C061I3K|3.0|but it's better than the direction they were taking with Robot Rock. The Tron Soundtrack was a nice getaway, but here they are trying to reclaim their best sound with Discovery (2001). That album had all their best hits, a pure soundscape. Here there are a few tracks that really stand out.
0316010669|4.0|This is the first of Gladwell's books I've read.  Using a variety of examples, the author presents and thoroughly explains his premise.  Only one reason why I didn't give it a fifth star - an analysis sprinkled liberally with his position on the Second Amendment was overlong and unnecessary.  His illustration, the tragic, preventable shooting death of Amadou Diallo, was spot on, but subtly inserting his political views into this section made me fully aware of how apolitical the rest of the content is.  The material is so fascinating that it begs for a sequel.
0060191325|5.0|My assessment of the book and the message of the book seems to sit on a single observation:<br /><br />The \\"meaning and purpose of life\\" seems to simply be the continuation of life itself -  Life's creative process of regeneration.<br />So, from a man's experience, it seems like the orgasm is about as far as the experience really goes.  A woman, on the other hand, experiences the whole nine-month construction process first hand.  After the orgasm, the only thing a man can really do is to sit back and watch and wonder - \\"What the H... is Going On Here?\\"<br />Now you can try as you may to get more touchy-feely about the parenting experience but you cannot deny that something is definitely lacking on the male side of the job from the very onset.

B006AZZPCM|5.0|This is one of the best apps I've ever used no matter what you need to get this app! I love it I use it almost every day it's great for downloading videos but it's also great for just watching videos.

0385351399|3.0|The satire about the wonders of working in one of those high tech companies was perfect and could have been better developed with fuller characters so that it could have been a book that stood on its own.<br /><br />Most people are able to project just how the mindset shown can and does extend itself into government and certainly other authors have done a much better job of exploring that than Eggers does here.<br /><br />Just seems like a rushed book that needed a great deal more work before it was published.

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Awesome movie, even better with lots of supported formats. By far the best Star Trek movie to date. I was happy that it had the itunes digital download and that it wasn't one of those movies that you could put on your macbook pro and had to airplay it to the apple tv. It adds it to your itunes account so you can just stream it using the Apple TV.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I liked the storyline. I came to really care about the women in this book. However for me there were too many explicit sex episodes. I would have given this book 5 stars if the sex scenes were discreet. I do not like reading page after page about what people do when having sex. But the events in each woman's life kept me glued to this book. I recommend it for adults over 21 only.
B00BN3ECTS|4.0|I would have rated this with 5 stars, but the iTunes digital download has to be downloaded to your computer to watch on the Apple TV. 99% of the movies that have iTunes digital download add the movie to your iTunes account so you can just stream it directly from the Apple TV. This one does not and it is really annoying. If you want to stream to an Apple TV, you have to stream it out of iTunes on your computer (MacBook Pro in my case). This means you could have stuttering depending on your network and you have to leave your computer running to see the movie. I like to get on my Apple TV and see all of my movies and make a selection from there, not from my computer.
B00914JWSW|5.0|Always been a fan of Barbara Streisand so this was a revelation when i first read about it and purchased it. It was good to hear these songs that have never been released before and to hear how good her voice has gotten over the years. The souds of the banter between Streisand and the engineers  give this a more intimate quality that makes you feel like you are there. The highlights to me are  from the melancholy of If It's Mean&#34;t To Be to her version of Jimmy Webb's Didn't We (and much as I am partial to Richard Harris' version ), she gives him arun for the money  on her take of it. It makes one wonder how many more songs are hidden away that have yet to be released.
B00DJZR4A2|5.0|Elton John is the greatest musician of our time!  Great album from him and Bernie! He never disappoints his fans!
B006JJBFK0|5.0|This is an EXCELLENT release! While it has been noted that the new singer has been compared to Tarja in Nightwish(For good reason) It is not a clone or a ripoff of that seminal band.<br />These guys have their unique style and with the new singer; new directions to explore.<br />You won't be disappointed with the soaring vocals and mesmerizing sonic landscapes in harmony with the most captivating melodies bound together by some serious riffage sprinkled with some really, really good solos.<br />IMHO I would have to rate this CD as one of their best efforts to date.<br />I highly recommend this CD for all fans of this genre.
B001BANK32|5.0|I last read this when I was in high school, right after this came out. I enjoyed it tremendously once again. The problem I had reading it this time was that I could SOOOOOOO see Jack Nicholson playing the part of Jack in the book - I was actually hearing his voice while reading the lines. I haven't seen the other movie version yet, although I now have it to watch, and intend to do so in the next few days. Even with that, however, it was a terrific book. I needed a refresher, so now I can read Doctor Sleep!
B00ESY77LO|5.0|Great adaptation of a classic book. Its a Baz Luhrmann film, so if you do not like his style, you probably will not enjoy it.  I truly believe some great books are very difficult to make into movies (Catcher in the Rye).  I have seen the 1974 version and I know there are a couple more out there, but I like this one the best.  I am a fan of Baz Luhrmann movies, so his adaptation of the book was good.  Very colorful, good cinematography, great soundtrack.<br /><br />I cannot stress it enough, if you have not seen a Luhrmann film, be open minded when seeing this.  It dances in and out of modern themes.  That is what is appealing to me.  Weaving modern trends into a classic story without detracting from the story itself.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|just another big fish game that I love love love.....two thumbs up! I am so addicted and ready for jewel legends 2
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|I had heard the NEW cd from McCartney would sound like him but then again no. The sound is fresh.. Yet 3 or 4 song bring back the McCartney most people can't help but like. Half the songs stick in your head threw out the day. it's been a long time coming and just glad he still one of the best. Great album. Early days to me is a standout. But then again so are more then half these gems. Please buy this cd. The more you listen , the more you'll like. Jameslinc
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I like the graphics. And the quests make it fun. Hard enough to keep me entertained but easy enough that my seven yeAr old can play too.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I genuinely loved this book. Very sad but wonderfully written and meaningful. I would recommend it for sure. Beautiful story.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|If you like puzzle games you'll love it... Great game levels get hard good challenging game. A few adds other than that fun...

B000FC130E|5.0|Why go over the rainbow when you can go under the city? In this fun fantasy adventure, Richard Mayhew finds himself in an alternate London, beneath his own, filled with monsters and magic.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|Don't listen to this record expecting the angst-ridden, raw, and aggressive tunes that made up the amazing material the band put out in the early to mid 90's. Lighting Bolt is not Ten or Vs. and at the same time doesn't claim to be. This is an album made by a group of great musicians and songwriters who have seemingly transitioned from the angry young men they once were into family men and people who have grown and changed.<br /><br />This is a very solid effort by Pearl Jam. The overall writing has more depth than Backspacer but still retains the poppy alternative rock feel that Backspacer consisted of. I would say this is the best PJ record since Binaural in terms of memorable songs and consistency in songwriting and instrumental performances.<br /><br />Pendulum is without a doubt one of the coolest songs Pearl Jam has released in recent times. It is this dark and rhythmic tune that wouldn't sound out of place on Binaural or even next to earlier Pearl Jam tunes such as Indifference. Other standout tunes for me include Lightning Bolt (an upbeat rocker with a strong melody), Sirens (a beautiful ballad with great lyrics and U2-esque atmospheric guitar licks in the background), My Father's Son (a dark aggressive rocker with awesome and sarcastic lyrics), and Infallible (a tune that reminds me of something Queens of The Stone Age would write)<br /><br />Overall this is a quality album by a quality band. I don't know if Ten or Vs. (and to a lesser extend No Code) will ever be topped but Lightning Bolt is a very enjoyable and thoughtful album. I definitely recommend it to fans of the band or those just wanting a very solid rock album.
039916409X|5.0|Such an amazing book, tapping books rarely go as deep as explaining reasoning behind the tapping scripts, this one is an education on its own, I am recommending this book to all my clients, Margaret's work had a profound effect on me in every possible way, just watch her free videos, I have been using the tapping for 50 thousand dollars to overcome sabotage in everything from making money to weight loss, thank you Margaret Lynch!
B00C2VIA52|4.0|this game is highly addictive. buy it only if you wanna have fun for days and forget about everything else. sometimes the battles are a little easy but it is amusing to figure out the right combination of cards to use to bring down the enemy.
B008JFUR10|5.0|This movie is arguably this past summer's best blockbuster. The acting is alright, but what really makes this film so intriguing is its breathtaking visuals. The effects in this film are unbelievable. I cannot express how effectively this movie portrays giant robots and monsters; I could watch this movie many times before getting bored. Definitely worth purchasing.<br />If you want a more in-depth review of the film itself, check out my review at [...]
B0006GAOCW|5.0|This was a sweet story, a lovely story of father/daughter love and devotion, as well as a story of two young poeple who are<br />brought together through circumstances and fall in love. Their relationship is tender yet mature, the kind one would hope for<br />a daughter/son or grandchildren. The movie was uplifting and surprisingly void of sex and violence. Katie Holmes and<br />Marc Blucas gave a fine performance. They told the story largely and wonderfully through their expressive eyes- beautiful.<br />The story is a great example of family, love, caring and discipline, especially for young people.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|While not one to write reviews often at Amazon and having grown up a \\"Genesis Freak\\" om the 70s and thus having an early training in the expectation of top-notch musicianship and inventive songwriting, began with a respect for Beatles but deep appreciation came decades later in evolution as a musicologist. Used to grate when others would claim Beatles as \\"genius,\\" but looking back now it cannot be denied that it was a really special chemistry of great talents that may as well be called \\"genius\\" since there isn't anything else in the vicinity of what happened with this musical phenom. People will of course raise objections ranging from Hendrix to Zappa. face it: Beatles a cultural EXPLOSION still reverberating through the planet. attempts to deny or marginalize this are LAUGHABLE.<br /><br />The NEW album, while being imho the nearest perfect album in what is an illustrious solo career, is a part of the greater BEATLES legacy. In this, alone, the album is a smashing success that feeds my soul surely as if it were a new BEATLES album. As far as my heart is concerned, it IS a new BEATLES album. Each of the songs is not only crafted to the highest state a pop song could ever hope to be, but also the production team, due to the love in their own hearts for BEATLES, has immersed these gems in a sound hearkening back to The White Album which is spine-tingling, to say the least! Of course, at times we can hear Wings or the early McCartney sound and i daresay some nods to Alan Parsons, at least production-wise. Overall though, a breath of fresh air to any true lover of BEATLES.<br /><br />One might say that this is over-enthusiastic gushing but disagree: this is a great album and giving this 3 stars or lower is some kind of crazy axe to grind. PAUL AND YOU CHAPS DON'T EVEN WORRY ABOUT THOSE DOWNWORDS. You've done a great job and thanks for your efforts. McCartney has single-handedly brought more smiles and light-heartedness to this world than all the critics combined. This single album will too. guaranteed.<br /><br />To the casual reader: if you ever enjoyed McCartney or Wings, if The White Album ever brightened your day, this album has the magic. If you are looking for something new and innovative that sounds completely different why demand it from Paul? He does what he does perfectly and it is what the rest of us want. And he HAS OBVIOUSLY grown as an artist in skill, Craft and aesthetic judgement.  A LOT. this album is probably the best rock album of the year. dig itingle album will too. guaranteed.<br /><br />To the casual reader: if you ever enjoyed McCartney or Wings, if The White Album ever brightened your day, this album has the magic.

B00746O3X8|2.0|If someone got this as a gift, they'd have a tough time figuring out how to use it. Absolutely no instructions and the illustrations completely inadequate.<br /><br />The camera attachment screws don't inspire confidence, especially if you are hanging $3000 dollars worth of camera and long lens on them.<br /><br />I did find that using the second carrier on a separate,sturdy belt works for a second camera.
B00957T6X6|4.0|Everyone dies is a good plot summary.  So few characters left at end of fifth book that difficlt to get interested in reading a sixth.
B000FC0V3E|3.0|I enjoy reading good writing and good story telling.  The Sun also rises is well known so I felt I had to read what others felt so strongly about.  The story itself is interesting, taking you from one local to another. The relationships are somewhat confusing and in general not interesting.  Die hard purists will enjoy Hemingway's style and wholeheartedly enjoy this tale.  For me it took awhile to sink in.
B004661J04|4.0|I've watched Se7en 3 or 4 times now.  I'd almost give it 5 stars and probably should.  The ending still rattles me every time I watch it.  Some have put this film in the horror category and I suppose this could be true enough in many respects, but I don't really see it that way.  It's more in the line of say, &#34;Wire In The Blood&#34;, where the sleuths are hard after a serial killer.  But where that trail ultimately leads is the real payoff for this movie.  If like me, you're a fan of this type of &#34;detective&#34; after the psycho killer type movie, I can whole-heartedly recommend Se7en as one of the best of it's type.
0399255370|5.0|This is a well written kids book, and it is really fun to read. The letters the crayons wrote are actually very funny. My kid giggled every time I read &#34;Your tired red crayon!&#34;. And the argument between the yellow crayon and orange crayon about who is the official color for the sun always make us laugh. The colors and drawings in the book are very well done. Highly recommended!
0446555002|5.0|Being a Pendergast follower this was by far the best story I've read yet. The action was so crisp and the characters so vivid that the whole book was habit forming. I see that the story within a story technique was followed again by the authors. It's almost like getting two books for the price of one. This one is a real treasure. Pick up a copy and prepare to be wowed.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This author writes with a wonderfully captivating style with so many great ideas. The series totally caught me off guard with its ability to entertain the adult as well as the teen. I would give Mockingjay 5 stars, if were not for the woeful mishandling of the love triangle. No clear romantic attraction does not make for an ending with babies, sorry.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|Others have done a much better job of describing the story line than I could ever do.  I was a huge fan of books 1, 2, and 3.  Book 4 seemed to drag, and now we hit book 5, A Dance with Dragons.<br /><br />I found this book to be ponderously slow, even tedious.  There was way too much extraneous BS that had to be slogged through.  I don't see the point in mentioning hundreds of names and battles if those aren't mentioned anywhere else in the book...it just seemed like fluff or filler.  It often seemed that Martin was getting paid by the page rather than to produce an excellent book like the first three.  There was \\"little and less\\" to like about this book.<br /><br />I kept getting this image of a school boy, assigned a 1,000 word essay, saying all he really needed to say in 250 words, and then \\"fluffing it out\\" to reach the required 1,000 words.  I finished this book, but only because I had so much invested in the first 3.  As another reviewer noted \\"...its time to tie the loose ends and finish this tale\\".
B000FBJAEG|4.0|The character names caused me to stop several times to remember who was who.  Otherwise a great story by a great author.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|Paul's new cd is a complete delight from first note to last. He can still write great songs with ease. This is light years better than 98% of the crap that passes for music nowadays. This is what real songwriting and performing is all about. Not a bad song to be found and the last track \\"Scared\\" is amazing as well. The six<br />year wait was worth it. This is Paul's best album since \\"Flaming Pie\\". get it and play the hell out of it.<br />Paul is back!

B00B29J0I6|1.0|Immediately after rebooting my Droid X because it was getting sluggish, I checked to see what was already running and was surprised to see that one of the running apps was Rescue Roby. Why? There is no LEGITIMATE reason why a game like this should install itself as a startup app. Do not trust developers who do sneaky stuff like this. Uninstalled.
B0082Z447U|2.0|I was unable to finish this book which is written by several persons. It starts fairly easily with Walter Hartright, a teacher of drawing, who meets the woman in white while walking home late one night, and is intrigued by her. After he has left her where she asked him to, two men ask him if he has seen her as they are looking for a woman who has escaped from an asylum. The story is written in a disjointed pedantic manner and is frankly boring.
140006922X|5.0|Amazing!! Aslan has written an easy book that can be enjoyed by anyone. Within the first chapter you can tell the amount of research he put into Zealot, his accounts of the Romans coincided nicely with other historical records.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Hundreds of these games online, with all kinds of different characters.<br />It's no longer original, and honestly a rather boring game.
B008JFUQZ2|4.0|I went into Pacific Rim only knowing that it involved giant mechs fighting monsters; Some things about it will make you want to switch your mind off, and once you do you'll have an amazing time. Del Toro has made another piece of visual eye candy, wrapping it all up in intense action and homages to classic kaiju movies and mecha anime. If you're a fan any of these things, you'll have so much fun watching.<br /><br />That said, the 'Special Edition' DVD that I got isn't exactly the best, and I feel I should have upgraded to the Blu-Ray and gotten my money's worth. The special features is bare-boned, and is notably missing promised deleted scenes and blooper reel. Not a very big deal, but to someone that wanted to see those it's annoying. Unless you REALLY don't want to, get the Blu-Ray/DVD option.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game. If I were u I would buy it. It is so awesome that I can't stop playing.

B006PIXKVW|5.0|This is coming from a guy's perspective. I have seen this movie many times (I have seen most of the top 200 best rated movies on IMDM). This movie is one of my favorites of all time. I think, this movie is one of most under-rated movie there is. I have seen this movie when I was a young boy and this movie inspired me ever since. What inspired me is not the movie itself but the main character's (Sarah) characteristics. She has a wild imagination and is very creative, she dreams big, she is positive and caring, willing to stand her ground and best of all, she had a great personality. I always try to be like Sarah especially having wild imagination and being positive.

B009RX7IX8|5.0|This is the fifth season of Castle I have bought on DVD  and it is very entertaining and well written.  There are varied storylines that have carried through all five seasons and keep the material from being repetitive and boring.  They contain suspense, drama and just enough comedy to keep you chuckling and enjoying each episode.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I don't even know how many times I have re-read this book.  And every time I catch something new.  The story is riveting and the characters strong and smart.  This will always be a favorite!

1250038820|5.0|magnificent endeavor specially suited for a world-class city and new immigrant hub like Gotham/the Big Apple/New York City. I surfed through Brandon Stanton's FB photos and vignettes of his subjects.... unique \\"human beings\\" who have settled NYC and made it the cradle of such vibrant energy, creativity, entrepreneurship, and yes... absolutely, \\"humanity.\\"<br />My only constructive criticism of Mr. Stanton's amazing project and how he \\"connected\\" with so many uniquely interesting New Yorkers -- from all walks of life, all ethnicities nationalities, backgrounds, cultures.... is simply that \\"I wish he could have done a lot more in connecting with the little \\"yellow people\\" and \\"brown people\\" who have settled in almost all American major urban hubs and now increasingly spreading out to the heartland.<br />The \\"browning\\" and yellowing\\" of America --- in the influx and synergy brought upon the new America by new immigrants from Latin America (the browning) and Asia-Pacific (the yellowing) is a saga and yet to be fully-explored and fully-understood story.<br />New York City is specially affected by these dual inroads of the \\"browns\\" and the \\"yellows.\\"<br />But understandably, it is probably not easy for Brandon Stanton, given his language (Anglophone) limitation to really able to \\"connect\\" with the yellow and brown people of New York City.<br />How I wish that later, as his project evolves, and onto his next phase of HONY....

B009XIXVU6|1.0|I did not like reading this book.  I jumped around from one character to another and one place and point in time to another. It was way to hard to follow and used different names for the same character. It was like the author started a story, got stuck, then started another story then decided to go back to the other story. Was not enjoyable to read.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Really enjoying the game. Deeper than expected with the chance to earn income to use to upgrade weaponry, in turn allowing for bigger hunts. It gives it that &quot;one more round&quot; factor.
B00DW1WR14|1.0|some where in the mid 90's we should of started to call them the Eddie Vedder Band,<br />they have to be one of the most disappointing bands of all time.

B00AEFXZJE|5.0|I loved the music and this older version of Footloose. Although I've seen it many times, It is one movie that I can watch over and over.  Some movies I can't even watch once.  This might be an oldie but it is a goodie.

B002WIDRM6|5.0|Love love love Lady Antebellum! This is one of my favorite albums of their's! Definitely should listen to it! :)
B00E9P959O|5.0|If they had done this with an earlier album, say 2112, or Permanent Waves, I would have cried foul.  Like George Lucas editing in Jabba at Mos Eisley, or Spielberg changing all the guns (in E.T.) to walkie-talkies...hehe.<br /><br />But, this had been a landmark album considering it was their return to the band after a long absence to deal with...life.  Still, it took almost a year to record the original version of Vapor Trails-it surprises me that they still felt it wasn't what they intended.<br /><br />All that aside, I loved the original Vapor Trails a lot.  I listened to it daily, for months, before I eased off of it.  When I would revisit from time to time, I had noticed something about it that I had wished was a tad different.  It seemed too dark.<br /><br />The remix is not so dark, and that is probably the biggest overall improvement I would note.  To me it's worth another $12.  More specifically, there are sounds and even large pieces of content that didn't exist in the original.  I noticed immediately brief solo's from Alex that I never heard.  All the newly audible content had either been buried or removed for the original recording.  There are some negatives in my opinion.  The drums seem less...well, less.  They are kind of weak in contrast to the original.  I remember hearing One Little Victory for the first time (years ago) and feeling positively attacked by Neil's drums (in a good way).  In the remix, I feel more like I'm being lightly molested.  There's another difference in the drums (at least in this song) with the presence of a flanger type affect I hadn't noticed in the original.  I like the flanger effect, but not the taming of his prowess.  To me (despite Neil's place in drumming history) this is still not a crime, if the overall product is improved.<br /><br />I feel compelled to say that those of you taking the position of \\"Can't improve bad song-writing\\" that I whole-heartedly disagree.  Lyrically and musically, this was ALWAYS a fantastic album, even if some couldn't hear it.<br /><br />I do like the remix more.  It's sometimes not preferable to change something that everyone has gotten used to.

1250007208|5.0|This is a really interesting take on the old cinderella fairy tale and I found it very enjoyable! I will warn you that it is a series!
B000SGGUWS|5.0|This book was really good. It practically summed up the first few episodes of ALL I never thought I would like something like this but I loved it. Totally recommend it.
B00CBKLO52|3.0|The gameplay is really hard and strange to get used to but once you have the hang of it is great. I hate that you have to buy all new planes boats and helis would be a lot better if they came in packs of planes.only buy if you can avoid raging and expensive planes.
B00C7607BC|5.0|Great!  My Granddaughter loved the movie.  It seems wonderful that these movies go from generation to generation.  I enjoy also.
B009IJZ9DW|5.0|I first heard of Angela Carter when I was maybe 12 and saw the movie The Company of Wolves, I loved that movie so much and wanted to read the book but never found it, and as I grew up, I forgot about it... until I got Kindle and could basically read anything I wanted from around the world. Recently I remembered the book and it was best to have read it now as a grown up for I would have missed so much of the hidden references and the erotic atmosphere that surrounds these tales. Genius reinvention of folk tales and fairy tales, my favorite one is the Erl King. Carter shows us theses secret places of a woman psyche, the horror mixed with pleasure, the voices in the dark, and presents us with nonconformist heroines who take their destiny in their own hands, whether they fall from grace or walk out safe, it was entirely a choice of each one of them, a triumphant choice in every case. These folk tales we heard all of our lives, the pg rated version anyway, were always telling women to rely on beauty and virtue, to expect an impossible prince charming, to be rescued, be passive and submissive. Carter changes all those ideas which are imprinted in our minds even as grown up women, and changes the roles entirely; those who chose to become beasts and love savagely do on their own terms and in their own sweet time; those who choose darkness are redeemed and those who chose light do it to please no other than themselves. Besides all of that it was very entertaining to read, the exuberance of her words in some tales was very sensual and inviting.
1401938906|4.0|I liked this book. It was easy reading and very thought provoking. I have read many other books that focused only on ideologies. Pam Grout has an amazing writing style that combined with humour and deep thinking.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Book brings forth the relationship between parent and child.  Just &#34;how far would we go&#34; to protect our child, do we see them as they really are or as we want them to be.  Very interesting - especially enjoyed the trail dialogue and the twist at the end.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|If your a fan of Pearl Jam, chances are you have already purchased this and listened to it multiple times. If not, buy it, listen to it, be happy that this band is still kicking ass!<br /><br />Also, the case this comes in is awesome. Each song is paired with a piece of art. They ditched the typical plastic jewel case in favor of a book style case with the art/lyric booklet attached with the CD in a pocket at the end.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|this i a great app maybe the best app ever  i love this app and so will you.great great great appp

B009LDD54K|5.0|Boardwalk Empire improves every season unlike the swill the bootleggers are selling. The actors have grown into their roles which is making them harder to control - fun, murder and mayhem will eventually overtake this show.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Can play either slots or bingo without leaving the app.  Both games are easy to play and give hours of fun.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Such a modest beginning to the most intriguing show on TV. Thank God Kurt Sutter threw out the rule book and every show had the potential to raise the bar or bring the roof down on everybody 's head - all TV should be so dynamic - I don't want 2014 to come.
0670024856|5.0|Alma Whittaker is born on the first year of a new century, January 5, 1800, but her story begins before her conception. Her father, Henry Whittaker, survived a poverty-stricken childhood near London, where he lived in a hut with an earthen floor and was not always fed. However, his upbringing gave him something that would someday make him incredibly wealthy: an understanding and a gift for horticulture. Henry's father tended the orchards at Kew Gardens and bequeathed to his youngest son a love for trees. Henry was also intelligent enough to know that he could only raise his stature through knowledge, so he learned everything he could about the one avenue of scholarship available to him. He became a tree wizard. Yet he watched the wealthy with avidly envious eyes and yearned to become rich.<br /><br />Kew Gardens held thousands of specimens of plants, including exotic rare varieties acquired by Sir Joseph Banks, the ambitious superintendent. Henry admired Banks, who was a handsome and aggressive explorer --- the extreme opposite of Henry's modest father. Admiring Banks did not keep Henry from robbing him; Henry built up quite a business stealing seeds and cuttings, which he sold to collectors all over the world. Eventually, though, he was caught and threatened with death. Yet Banks admired the way Henry had acted on his ambitions and hired him to embark on a voyage with Captain Cook.<br /><br />Henry's years of adventuring and traveling to various ports eventually paid off when he discovered a type of tree in Peru with the power to cure malaria. He also had a plan for a plantation of these trees that would eventually pay off in an enormous way, but when Banks pooh-poohed the notion, Henry sold his ideas and plant starts to the Dutch East India Company. This was the first step to building a huge fortune and maintaining a mansion in Philadelphia with the Dutch wife he acquired along the way.<br /><br />Now his wife, Beatrix, has finally given him a daughter. Alma's life is filled with luxury, but even more so, it is filled with intellectual encouragement and the time to explore the acres her family owns. Both parents are geniuses at botany, and Alma absorbs plant and science knowledge, eventually settling on a long-lasting deep study of mosses. The years pass. Henry and Beatrix adopt a beautiful daughter, Prudence. Alma, in contrast to her adopted sister, is large and homely, which adds complications when she develops sensual yearnings and falls in love. Readers experience her life's valleys, mountains and unexpected side road meanderings in the same way Alma studies her mosses: detail by exquisite detail.<br /><br />THE SIGNATURE OF ALL THINGS is a magnificent literary triumph that surely will be long heralded as an enduring classic. But more than that, it's an absorbing, satisfying page-turner of a read. That the pace is unhurried only adds layers to the fascinating depths of Alma's life story. This is not a book to skim or read rapidly; I found myself rereading passages to admire the elegant phrasing. I also marveled frequently at the extent of author Elizabeth Gilbert's research, as well as her versatility (after penning her bestselling --- but oh so different --- memoir, EAT, PRAY, LOVE). As a side note, the book is a joy to hold and look at, with its heavy-papered, deckle-edged pages and gloriously illustrated end pages.<br /><br />This marvelous piece of historical fiction is a volume to be cherished, kept and reread.<br /><br />Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon
B00B52F278|5.0|There has been nothing on TV like Spartacus and the final season only built on that premise. History buffs already know how it ends, but it makes such an end. Kudos to cast and crew for maintaining the quality until the very end. Spartacus' memory deserves nothing less.
B00FFVLYTU|5.0|I really like how it was one crime for the series instead of a new crime weekly.  It seems more realistic.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love this app, but I think SwiftKey should have more themes, more colors, and It should be improved the performance.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|Listened to this CD four times today. I couldn't help but notice that the material seemed familiar, but in a good way. It is the sound of a master of his craft still on top of his game, sounding fresh and energized. Yes, his voice does not have the range it did in 1967 (whose does?) Avoid trying to compare this effort to 'Hey Jude', or 'Band on The Run'. Just listen to the different styles, tempos, lyrics and melodies and enjoy one of the greats doing what he does best. Great effort that can stand the test of time, because all his great works are timeless. Just listen and enjoy! I love this album, and hope we can get another one soon! (Ringo, wouldn't it be fun to do an album with your old band mate.....? Just a thought). I especially recommend the Deluxe version. You won't regret it. Grammy worthy material, along with Elton John's  The Diving Board. Bless you Sir Paul! Keep them coming.
B008Q08IV4|5.0|The movie &#34;Forrest Gump&#34; is a wonderful story.  The actors are excellent, and the story has something we can all learn:  Work hard, do your best, and don't worry about what other people think about you.
1611762022|2.0|I really admire Elizabeth Gilbert. I pre-ordered the book and looked forward to it's arrival.  I almost sent it back because the cover was damaged in the shipping because I thought it would be a book that I wanted to keep. I was wrong. The beginning description of her father's rise to wealth was interesting and well written, but then from there it went downhill fast. Unbelievable flat characters.  Shock value content without delving into deeper meaning. I don't even want to pass the book on to anyone else.  I would tell my friends not to read it. The ending was bizarre and disconnected. The Tahitian portion was particularly unengaging and out of sync with the rest of the book.  The biggest disappointment was no depth, no insight, and nothing to impart to the reader. If you just want to mindlessly pass your time with a poorly contrived story, go ahead, but I was expecting more from Elizabeth Gilbert.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|first time i have bought one of the cds in years. i heard him playing it on the internet on heart radio he play a few tracks from it. i`m playing it now and i think its great.  the only thing is the stupid packaging are they saving that much money. its  not easy to get the cd out with out almost putting your figure print on it which of course will make it skip
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|For sure a page turner!  I loved catching up with Danny . Stephen King is a  great writer  I can't wait for the next book!

B00B769XB8|5.0|This movie is a real hoot.  Lots of fun with terrific 3D effects.  I guess it's best described as a terrific looking &#34;B&#34; movie.  Everyone I've shown the movie to has thoroughly enjoyed it.  The contemporary tone to the film makes it even more fun.  The &#34;weapons&#34; are very much over the top which adds to the enjoyment.

B00DXP7L88|1.0|Loved one reviewers comment on &#34;hoping it was all a bad dream!&#34;.  If a Dexter movie is in the works, PLEASE Writers, make all this a horrible, bad, disgusting, weird, disturbing dream!!!  Or should I say nightmare!  The only way this season can ever be redeemed is if it NEVER EXISTED at all.  Spoiler Alert...Maybe Dexter wakes up from being hit on the head by Saxon or a concussion caused by the hurricane and POOF... Deb is alive, Dexter killed Saxon on his table (which after all, is in his nature to do) and all his &#34;unnatural&#34; decisions that created this mess in the first place NEVER came to fruition.<br /><br />This whole Dexter becoming human theme caused him to do incredibly stupid, irresponsible, life altering acts that changed everyone's destiny FOR THE WORSE!!!  Too many unanswered questions, abandoning Harrison, letting a serial killer who you have known for 2 seconds raise your son, killing Deb (directly and indirectly), Quinn not knowing what happened to Deb.... the list goes on and on but one thing is for sure.  This all pales in comparison to &#34;Dexter the Mountainman&#34; and the one constant in his life - Deb being gone forever.  Even my son who considers Dexter the greatest TV show of all time couldn't believe the shockingly stupid, dull, rushed, low budgeted, uninspired ending!!!<br /><br />No ONE wanted to see Dexter dead.  That would be too final, a slap in the face to all faithful viewers and leaving no possible future for Dexter.  That would have sucked big time.  But Dexter's death would have been better than this pitiful, lazy, disappointing ending!!!  Dexter's &#34;human&#34; actions caused Vogel's and Deb's death.  Not to mention the twisted unnatural fate of so many others.<br /><br />The season as a whole was just NOT up to typical Dexter standards.  But you could almost be okay with it because even a bad episode (writing) of Dexter was still so good it put its competition in the dust.  If Season 8's ending was of Season 1-4 caliber, it would have partially redeemed the entire season.  But now.... Dexter has a new title.  &#34;Worst Finale of All Time&#34;.  I do NOT think the writers could have possibly come up with a worse ending.  What an enormous let down to one of the most admired series of all time.  If Season 8 comes in a set (Season 1-8), then buy it.  But if you are attempting to buy ONLY Season 8, save your money.  Unless you are into big disappointments.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|\\"Holding Eleanor's hand was like holding a butterfly. Or a heartbeat. Like holding something complete, and completely alive.\\"<br /><br />Why haven't I read this book sooner and why haven't I heard more about this author?!?! I love when I stumble upon that moves me and leaves me thinking about it for days. *sigh* I seriously fell in love with this book, its innocence and the storytelling is brilliant and moving; I couldn't get enough of Eleanor and Park.  I'm not sure if it was all the comic book references that captivated me or if it was the fact I went back in time to 1986 but what's the point of trying to figure out what captivated me when the bottom line is... I LOVED IT!!!<br /><br />\\"Nothing was dirty. With Park. Nothing could be shameful. Because Park was the sun, and that was the only way Eleanor could think to explain it.\\"<br /><br />Eleanor has crazy red hair (her wardrobe will make you cringe) and Park is half-Korean who sometimes likes to wear eye liner but yet they make complete sense.  Park seemed somewhat lost when he met the troubled Eleanor but an unlikely friendship forms slowly between them over comic books and mixed tapes. High school is a complete and total jungle but when you have someone in your life that loves you for you and believes in you, anything is possible.  These characters felt incredibly genuine at every turn and all I wanted to do was reach through the book and hug them.<br /><br />\\"Maybe Park had paralyzed her with his ninja magic, his Vulcan handhold, and now he was going to eat her. That would be awesome.\\"<br /><br />This is a slow-building story, it moves with such fluidity that you will feel every blessed detail of Eleanor and Park's relationship.  Hand holding has taken on a new meaning for me and every dang time that Eleanor and Park held hands it took my breath away.  Normally I don't like alternating POV every other chapter as I find it jarring but in this case it made sense, it worked and it wasn't distracting in the least bit.<br /><br />\\"The first time he'd held her hand, it felt so good that it crowded out all the bad things. It felt better than anything had ever hurt.\\"<br /><br />To tell you what this story is about is to rob you of the experience and I refuse to do that, the blurb alone will give you an idea.  What you need to know:<br /><br />-It's about falling in love for the first time.<br />-Be prepared to relive all the awkwardness and cruelty of high school.<br />-There is angst and your heart will hurt.<br />-Eleanor is a very complex character, more so than Park but you will love them both equally.<br />-Rainbow Park has captured the essence of what it's like to be a teenager, she made me remember and I love her for it.<br /><br />\\"I want everyone to meet you. You're my favorite person of all time.\\"<br /><br />Don't wait a moment longer to read this story, it's worth every penny and you can thank me later!!!bit.<br /><br />\\"The first time he'd held her hand, it felt so good that it crowded out all the bad things.

B008JJM88Q|5.0|Ok, so this game is super creepy because it guesses even the most obscure characters. A lot of fun to play as a group; trying to think of the most obscure person.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This app was a lot of fun.  This was my first app of this type.  Only disappointment was how quick it over.  I will keep the app for future rooms.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|My grandchildren in Israel requested this. They range in age from 4 till 14. Each one of them loves this toy. They have the earlier ones, and they can spend hours with it. Next time I will bring them the perplexus twist, which is the latest one.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I have to say this book was exceptionally easy to follow along and hit all the key points in a direct and informative manner.<br /><br />Well Done.<br /><br />Strongly recommend!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|After 4 years of tension, season 5 of Castle and Beckett as a (secret) couple is a personal relief and adds to the enjoyment of their working together to solve crimes.
1931955085|5.0|One of my favorite artists so the book could never disappoint. I have a few of them now and I love flicking through them.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|There are things that change often and I don't always like the changes. I should be able to go in and customize my own account more
B0071XO8RA|5.0|So great. I love these types of stories and am totally loving this. Only half way through but love it and will read the others for sure.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|I like to use this but it makes my battery go really fast.. But very handy for night time where it is not well lit.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|i mean, i hate when a book is not only not very good, but then you get to the end, and there is no end as you have to read yet another book. Its a love story. I mean, Daniel Steel could have written it. It's not much else.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|I was satisfied with the ending. An entertaining series! Great characters, unique plot. When does the movie come out???? I can see it...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's a very bare bones game in that the graphics are simple and there are no instructions, but once you get the gist of the game it's not hard to figure out what to do next. It can be a little frustrating if you are stuck,  since there are no hints. The game was challenging but not too hard. I look forward to seeing more levels and rooms! If you enjoy these sorts of games, then definitely give this a try!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome and kid friendly. It will keep you entertained for a while as you attempt to get past all of the missions and daily challenges. Have fun!
B00008AY3L|1.0|Had purchased this CD then saw the comments that other buyers wrote warning of the Virgin/EMI protections that prevent you from downloading this CD to your computer or MP3 player. After reading that info, I immediately cancelled my order of this CD. Hey Ben Harper/Virgin Records... \\"FREE FREEDOM\\" Burn One Down!<br /><br />From M.S.Hills review: A page on the Web site of Virgin Records America confirmed the CD has been booby-trapped. A feedback form on their site did not work. I hope others are as outraged as I am and put some effort into tracking down how to voice displeasure.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|He knows all the tricks, but the story is over-complicated and not compelling enough to keep me up nights. If you're going to do something as extended as this, I'd prefer a book from Gayle Lynds--her work is far superior to Mr. Child's, and I always feel I'm learning things while still totally immersed in the story.<br />Len Lamensdorf
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This product is fantastic. It cleans as described. It also tells you what applications have malware. I was told one of the games I downloaded was infected. That product was Word Search. Download this app you will not be disappointed.
0545265355|5.0|They were in great condition and the box was too. I can't eait to read them again and learn more than I did the first time.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Hooks up really easy. Directions for downloading the apps are simple. The stream quality is great-it's hard to believe it's being transmitted through wi-fi. For $35 you can't go wrong.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is amazing gives me something to do while I'm on the max or the bus in the mornings before school!!!!!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Well written. Not condescending or judgemental. Definitely not a how-to, but rather a prompt to keep moving onward and upward, and to help current and future generations of women achieve true equality.
B00684J49U|5.0|Great series and one of my personal favorites. Glad I was able to get the eighth season to add to my collection! Will definitely enjoy going back to relive this awesome drama from the beginning!! I recommend this show to any one else who is a an avid watcher of this series and a long time fan.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Somehow I missed the last episode of Orphan Black and watched it on Amazon. Very good. Can't wait for the series to start again.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I really am enjoying this game. The graphics are good, and the physics are good too. The only thing I would change is that things should be a little cheaper at the lower levels.
B00DNLXDUW|1.0|I does not work....do not buy, use it, try it, download it.  It is not worth the $.99 I paid for it!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I like it because you create your own park<br />And all the dinosaurs and to evolve them and all the expand space plus the water
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Very good app! works great for when you are on the go and only have your phone. user friendly. love
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|This game was lots of fun for a week...then when I went to play it one day it said I need to update in order to play. The problem is there is no update. I've been waiting for almost a month for a magical update to appear so I can play again, but after some research I found that this is an ongoing problem with this game. So play it if you want a good week out of it but don't pay for anything. You'll just be throwing money away.
B009EE4YWI|4.0|Very good quality, rating was on my opinion of the movie itself. It was really funny, kept me entertained and I would defiantly watch it again.

B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|it's amazing to me that these guys keep playing 40+ years hence.  Stills is at his gravelly best, still playing great riffs with a legendary supporting cast.  one of my favorite cuts is Word Game - still strong and I'm sure Stephen enjoyed his own remix!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Graphics are good. Puzzles are not too difficult but not insultimately easy. I wish there were more levels but it was free. Good waiting room game.

159463176X|4.0|Every chapter was a story about a different character and I found it boring at the end.  I enjoyed the book though and enjoy reading a book with his writing style.  Each of these characters could have had their own book.
1932100660|5.0|It IS the most comprehensive study of nutrition.  I would recommend this book to anyone with diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and/or cancer.  All of these are preventable, in most cases reversible and NO ONE should have to live with these diseases.  I have been diabetic for 14 years and have been on insulin for the past 4.  By switching to a plant based diet, I am now free of ALL medications plus the expense of them.  I HIGHLY recommend this book.

B00APAENUI|5.0|Extremely well written and absolutely thrilling.  Fun, exciting.<br />The way that Mr. Weber captures Honor Harrington' s feelings is remarkable.  I used to think that Robert Heinlien was my favorite Scfi author but Weber has successfully supplanted him.  I'm very happy with my decision.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I especially like the three dimensional quality of this game.  It is a fun twist on logic puzzles. Looking forward to additional rooms!

B00005NRO3|4.0|Marginally better than the first film, Scream 2 nonetheless still suffers from the delusion that it is somehow superior to the average slasher flick.  The problem remains; you can't hold such obvious distain for the genre, trying to distance yourself from it with lofty ambitions and claims of pseudo-originality, yet still succumbing to the use of identical elements that firmly ground you as just another slasher flick among many.<br />Their vain attempts at humor still spoil the effort to frighten.  It doesn't help that this film starts out with a repeat of the first film (a film within a film); basically telling the audience they need to be scared and here's the reason why.  Worse, they use Jada Pinkett as their vehicle to inform us that now is the time, be scared.  Unfortunately, her performance is so corny, so bloated with faked emotions that it comes off as a hack comedy routine that neither scares nor amuses.  That's the problem, so much time is wasted on being \\"cute,\\" with in-jokes and references to other better horror films, that they forget to keep on target and deal with the matter at hand.  This movie is padded with a lot of extraneous material causing the excitement that they do manage to stir up to lag behind.  And how many times can they expect to get away with the \\"are you alone in the house\\" routine before it gets old (so to the chase sequences within buildings, running from room to room, trying to stay ahead of the dopey person in the silly costume)?  This is the second film in this series and already they are locked into a formula (just like the rest of the genre).  Even more amazing, is that director Wes Craven purposely coaxes the same whack-a-doodle performance from his actors during the big no-surprise-reveal, causing one to wonder if Craven views all villains as the same variety of bug-eyed raving lunatics (one of the most used clich&eacute;s in filmdom).<br />(Eerily, in 1998 and 1999 reality imitated the debate featured in the film of whether movies inspire violence or not, when several teens stabbed people to death, claiming Scream as their influence.)inspire violence or not, when several teens stabbed people to death, claiming Scream as their influence.)

You simply use your phone/tablet as your remote to fire up the video, and then the Chromecast will take over and stream the video itself.  That's all it does.

B008OOYALE|1.0|Where to begin?  For starters, when compared to other similar games, Dragon Story makes every in-game purchase much more expensive.  For example it takes more to feed each dragon, and food is more expensive.  There is also little reward for in-game achievements.  Games like Dragonvale and Creatures of Olympus are much more rewarding and have balanced economies.  The result is that Dragon Story requires more in-app purchases using real money in order to be remotely as enjoyable.<br /><br />That, however, is not the worst of it.  My account experienced glitches which removed entire habitats, including the dragons within them.  Time and energy wasted.  I emailed the support team, and not only did it take them several days to reply, but they were not helpful at all.  The same day as their reply, I logged in only to discover that my entire island had been wiped clean, and my account reduced to level one.  At this point, support couldn't even right the situation if they were willing, because I can't possibly remember all the habitats, and dragons, and what level they each were.  This is the most epic of failures from a game company that I have experienced.<br /><br />I have since deleted Dragon Story from my device, and will NEVER support any TeamLava or Storm8 release.  Play Dragonvale; there's a lot more you can do in that game anyway.
B00AEFY3MC|4.0|You don't have to be a fan of \\"Star Trek\\" to like \\"Galaxy Quest,\\" but it helps. This lighthearted spoof skewers all the conventions of the sci fi genre without mocking them. Tim Allen and Sigourney Weaver are the big stars here, but I liked the totally unhinged performances from Sam Rockwell and Tony Shalhoub (unsurprisingly typecast as a neurotic engineer) best. The premise is simple: an aging television show has a crew who are scraping the bottom of the professional barrel when real aliens who have patterned their entire civilization around them recruit them to help negotiate with (and later militarily defeat) Sarris, an impossibly ugly and cruel alien who clearly pays homage to the Klingons from \\"Star Trek\\" (his ship likewise bodges together features of a Klingon ship and the planet killer from the classic \\"Star Trek\\" episode \\"The Doomsday Machine.\\") Through much drama and entirely predictable scenes (Tim Allen loses his shirt in an epic battle with space babies, a pig-lizard, and a rock monster, for instance) the actors learn to be a real starship crew keeping the universe safe for civilization in the end. As an aside I did find the joke about \\"Gilligan's Island\\" (\\"Those poor people...\\") from the Thermian's \\"historical documents\\" hilarious, and laughed out loud at the delightful deadpan delivery.<br /><br />I have to admit that I took a while to warm up to this movie, and therein resides my point reduction for the review. The film dragged on occasion, especially in the first half where the interpersonal dynamics were established in the crew (we get it: Tim Allen as Jason Nesmith is an arrogant slacker who his co-stars can barely stand to be in the room with; he's an undependable lout who never shows up on time...let's move along.) I eventually gave the film a four star rating, but in the first half I was considering less. Mercifully the pacing of the second half is much snappier and more satirically on point. I won't spoil the plot, but I was a particular fan of the great twist ending and the last ten minutes of the film, which convinced me the film was worth a solid four stars overall. Special effects are first rate (I particularly liked the Thermian's cephalopod forms,) and the film is quite lavish especially given the subject matter (I did like the vintage \\"Galaxy Quest\\" footage shown in the film-within-a-film scenes where the Thermians come to grasp with the concept of acting.) If you want to see a light comedy with a sci fi bent, and particularly if you are a \\"Star Trek\\" fan, \\"Galaxy Quest\\" should be high on your viewing list.the great twist ending and the last ten minutes of the film, which convinced me the film was worth a solid four stars overall.

B00ADQPB50|2.0|Maybe the first season of American Horror Story just spoiled me and I was looking for something of equal or better quality. Unfortunately, this season seemed to be a cross between the X-files, The Exorcist, the Island of Dr. Moreau and Silence of the Lambs. I think the show lacked focus in that respect and it suffered. If they chose one of the story lines and expanded on it, I feel the series would have been strengthened and more entertaining. despite this, most of the acting was very good to excellent, especially  Zachary Quinto as Dr. Oliver Thredson. Sarah Paulson also played a strong role and was arguably equal to Quinto, though something about her character irked me......don't know what, but I'll chalk it up to counter transference. One other thing- Stop Imitating Boston Accents!! This idiosyncratic critique has to do with people that grew up in the Boston area as opposed to people watching this in other parts of the country who can't tell a cultured Cape Cod accent (Kennedy) versus someone from the general Boston area. Most of the actors did a fair job at it, but it's pretty irritating to hear words so over pronounced or not even pronounced \\"correctly.\\" Use your own voice and pronunciation. It makes the production more natural.

1451626096|4.0|If Philippa Gregory's interpretation of the relationship between Elizabeth of York and Henry Tudor is correct this was indeed an example of a hostage being browbeaten into identifying with the interests of her captors. But I find it hard to accept the premise that she ever could have loved her rapist. However briefly.<br /><br />I also have some difficulty with the idea that Perkin Warbeck in fact was Richard of York escaped from the Tower. The Plantagenets were entirely too cost effective in their killing habits to have allowed a pretender of his stature to escape in the first place. Those contemporaries who supported his claim obviously had political motives for doing so.<br /><br />But even with those caveats this is still an engaging and absorbing read.

039916409X|5.0|One of the really powerful aspects of this book is to help you uncover blocks to wealth and success that you didn't even know that you had. If one or more of your blocks are hidden to you, there's nothing you can do about them. This was certainly true for me, and I didn't think that I had much in the way of money/success blocks. Boy was I surprised!<br /><br />Here is just one quick example. One of the hidden vows that we can sometimes have is to not surpass the income/success of our parents due to issues of loyalty or fear of a backlash. This vow didn't apply exactly to me, but it got me thinking about my parents' income and level of affluence when I was growing up and my current situation.<br /><br />You see, my parents were upper middle class, and we had a very comfortable level of affluence when I was a child. I thought that their level of affluence was just fine and wanted to match theirs when I was an adult. I didn't have any desire to be \\"rich\\", but I did want to be upper middle class like them. There was only one little fly in the ointment that I wasn't aware of until used the principles in this book...<br /><br />I knew what my parents' income was, and I decided that I would make the same income when I grew up, which I did and I was proud of that. What I didn't take into account was that their income 40 years ago is worth waaaaaaay less now! I matched their INCOME to the dollar, but I didn't match their level of AFFLUENCE! I would have to make 2 to 3 times more money now in order to match their level of affluence back then.<br /><br />Well, this was an oh-my-god, smack-my-forehead moment for me! Then using the principles in this book, in particular EFT Tapping, has freed me up to think much bigger about my income and career, and I am in the process of implementing new approaches that will lead to doubling my income that I am really excited about! And this was just one example of the direct benefits that I have gotten from this killer book.<br /><br />I encourage you to check it and free yourself from the hidden vows that could be holding you back from the affluence and abundance that you can deserve.

If you have one of the Nissin flash units listed here, this is a good one... but there's more.<br /><br />I have a [[ASIN:B009AQB504 Nissin NDMG8000N Extreme Heat Fighting Tube]] flash unit, and it goes through batteries at a fairly fast rate. Did some online searching and found that this [[ASIN:B001BYXO7K Nissin NDBM01 Battery Compartment for Di466 & Di866 Flashes]] was also compatible with my MG8000 flash, so it was worth picking up a couple of these. This battery magazine offers the convenience of having all four AA-size batteries in the same direction, so the cells can be inserted correctly even in low light conditions. It also has a cover over the open end so that the batteries are protected and not rattling around in your camera bag or pocket when not in use.<br /><br />These have worked well, and it's good to see that there is some product compatibility that goes beyond the first glance. If you have a Nissin Di466, Di866 or MG8000 flash unit, this battery magazine is a good one, and highly recommended for those who need quick battery changes.<br /><br />10/16/2013

B005K0HDGE|4.0|The fantasy of time travel has always intrigued us. In modern times, perhaps beginning with Edward Bellamy's Looking Backwards, to HG Wells' The Time Machine, on to Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time, we have read fictions that explore the weird but familiar world of time travel. Similarly, the popular medium of television, through such shows as Star Trek, have explored the imaginative possibilities of this fantasy. Stephen King praises writer Jack Finney for his book Time After Time as an outstanding example of a time travel novel. In 11.22.63, Stephen King tries his hand at the genre with excellent results.<br /><br />Probably anyone old enough to be in school on November 22, 1963 has indelible images from that day seared into their brain. This is the date that John F Kennedy was assassinated. It was a national trauma in my lifetime matched only by the trauma of 9/11 for traumatizing our collective and individual psyches. I remember vividly my fifth grade teacher, Mrs. Handley, coming in and saying to us \\"I have some bad news. The president has been shot.\\" That was all the information we received at first, and when the bell rang, we were sent to different rooms for our reading groups. Mine was on the main floor of the old fifth and sixth grade building, where a large old-fashioned radio sat in a small room. The volume on the old radio was turned up probably as loud as it could go. I recall the announcer saying \\"Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States is dead.\\" The station then immediately played the national anthem. My own reaction was one just of shocked disbelief. Some of my classmates cried. I think all were stunned. The following days were filled with a national grief and a ritual funeral that attempted to grasp the gravity of what happened.<br /><br />What had happened, was that a lone, misfit of an individual by the name of Lee Harvey Oswald, had shot the president with a high-powered rifle. Oswald was later arrested only to be shot and killed himself a couple of days later by another misfit. This account of all lone gunmen acting out it deranged fantasy didn't seem to fit with what ought to have happened, that some deep conspiracy of great power must have been necessary to create so momentous an event. Thus, up sprung conspiracy theories that have spun almost endlessly since that date. Oliver Stone's JFK gave cinematic voice to those theories, but in the end, the conspiracy theories don't jibe with reality.<br /><br />In an interview about writing this book, Stephen King says he initially started the draft in 1973, ten years after the assassination, but he reports that he put it away because of the demands on his time and the freshness of the wound that he was attempting to address. Now, a couple of years short of the 50th anniversary of JFK's assassination, he came out with a book that deals with this momentous date, the issues of time travel and what might have been, and the differences between the world of the late 1950s and early 1960s. In it attempting to address all of these different concerns, King has done a masterful job creating a sense of time and place in the recent--and to some of us, remembered--past. King does this in large measure through characters that we come to know and care about. I have to admit this is the first work of fiction by Stephen King that I've read (earlier listened to his book On Writing), and I must say ability as a story teller is well displayed here. (I have seen some movies based on his work, such as The Green Mile, The Shawshank Redemption, and Stand by Me, all of which I found compelling.) I'd avoided King because I had always thought of them as a horror writer, but I see now that this does not do justice to his the scope of his abilities.<br /><br />The conceit of the book surrounds the discovery of a time warp in a small Maine town in 2011. An owner of a diner has discovered a time warp some time ago and visited the past (always the same date and time in 1958) going back and forth in time. He eventually decides that his mission should be to avoid the assassination of JFK, and thereby avoid the national trauma that the Vietnam War visited upon the nation. (I think him terribly optimistic about this prospect.) However, he cannot get himself to the time and place necessary to confidently intervene to stop Oswald, so he recruits the main character, Jake Epping, to go back in his place. Jake Epping, a high school English teacher, reluctantly agrees to go back in time to try to derail this horrific event and other tragedies. In doing so, he travels to what in to us is now the strange world of the late 1950s and early 1960s in America. Epping's self-imposed mission is made much more difficult by the fact that he falls in love with a woman who has her own past to deal with.<br /><br />King doesn't dwell on weird theories of physics in support of his time travel conceit, but he does provide some common sense observations on what it might be like, such as the conclusion that the past doesn't want to be changed. No doubt true, but that doesn't stop us from pondering the possibilities. Besides being a topic of interest for fiction writers, the \\"what if's\\" of history have tantalized serious historians and social scientists as well as fiction writers. What if Winston Churchill had not become prime minister in Great Britain in 1940? What if Hitler had successfully invaded? The number of possibilities are nearly endless once you crack open the past with an eye to changing it or imagining it come out differently. When we think philosophically and analytically about the past, we come up against the cold fact that the past is closed and fixed, while the future is open and uncertain (at least to some degree). When we try on mentally changing the past, we find, as the protagonist Jake Epping does, that things don't fit easily. The waves of consequence that emanate from any single fact disburse through the past creating a butterfly effect that can have nearly infinite repercussions.<br /><br />I'm very glad I read this book because I found a thoroughly enjoyable and engrossing. As we approach the anniversary of the assassination of JFK, there some other books I want to read as we try (continually, as with all good history) to assess JFK, the man and his presidency. Because his life and presidency were cut short at a time of such great change and trauma that we know came to pass in the United States during the period of about 15 years after his death, we wonder what would have happened had the assassin's bullet not struck. The fact is, we can never know, but we can wonder and ponder and argue these possibilities. It's not something worth doing because we can change anything in the past, but by casting the strongest possible light on the past, we can use the reflection to see a bit further where we might be going--and want to go--in the future.<br /><br />By the way, if you are interested, the initial character who discovers the time warp and decides to look into the Kennedy assassination in the hope of avoiding it, thought there was a \\"95% chance\\" that Oswald acted alone. King, in an interview, opines, after having researched the matter very thoroughly, that that probability is close to 98 or 99%. History sometimes lurches in unforeseeable ways based on the acts of the least formidable of individuals or the random events of nature. This event seems to be such an instance.58) going back and forth in time.

I think you will too give it a try bet you will try for three stars on every level, I know I do, I will keep playing that level until I have my three stars, so I can move on with a perfect score.... have fun and enjoy
B004ZRV3AU|2.0|Followed instructions and had no luck so I gave up. I scored the wine bottle dipped in hot water and then the cold five times and still it didn't separate.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Smart and captivating. I didn't want to put it down. My only wish is that there were a wedding but the love is obvious. Thank God for my kindle or I wouldn't be able to tap the dictionary to see what all the large obscure words are . I didn't mind. I can't wait for the next book.
039916409X|5.0|Margaret's products help you gain insight on what is holding you back and your deep seated insecurities. Yes it is a work in progress to get out of those insecure feelings but Margaret's breakdown on tapping is a wonderful tool to use.
B007REV4YI|5.0|It's the first Craig Bond movie that really feels like a Bond movie. The quality of the disc is very good and the extras are very entertaining.
B001BANK32|5.0|In anticipation of doctor sleep I reread this book after fifteen years. What a gripping tale. Such an insight into the dark depths of addiction and the whole epic just keeps you rivetted, night after night way past bedtime. Great read
0440242401|2.0|I enjoy Sophie Kinsella books when I want something light and amusing, but reading this book was a chore.  For one thing, it takes way too long to get the story moving.  Lexi is in the hospital for the first 6 or 7 chapters and those chapters drag on and on.  When the action does finally start, we meet one horrible and unlikeable character after the next.  There's no one to cheer for in this story.  Read \\"Undomestic Goddess\\" instead of this one.  If you want a story about refinding yourself watch \\"13 Going on 30\\".  That film does what Sophie does here, but with charming characters you actually care about.
B000ZJTPLG|5.0|I just happened to find this while I was messing around on my conputer. I thought it looked cool so I bought one. I am amazed at the sounds this thing has its crazy! At least with my earbuds if you can't turn it louder than half way up or your ears will blow off! I love this and will be keeping it for a long time.
B00B23O97Y|1.0|\\"Hey Clapton, you owe me $20.\\"  And here's some advice to you: Check into the nearest old-folks home and trade your Strat in for a shuffleboard stick. For the life of me I cannot begin to understand WHY you would produce such a bland, boring, uninteresting collection of musical fossils that should have been buried decades ago.  There is not one song on this entire album that I will ever play again.  This album is a total disaster and Clapton should be arrested as a music criminal.
B00CHVIPP2|5.0|Awesome movie. My son loves it. He asks for this movie all the time. He can follow it and its not scary and its funny for all of us. Great price also.
B00DYVUBYM|1.0|There's no plot in this movie. Basically, it depicts a group of rich, and spoiled teenagers burglarized the homes of several celebrities over a period believed to be from October 2008 through August 2009.  They netted  about $3 million in cash and high end goods.<br /><br />Their victims included Lindsay Lohan, Paris Hilton, Meagan Fox, Orlando Bloom, etc. It showed the victims made it easy for the thieves to steal. For example, people left keys in their unlocked cars. They also left drug, cash, and credit cards there. Some did not even lock their house doors. One victim even left the house key under the door mat.<br /><br />After the burglary, the teenage were shown doing drugs, trying on the stolen clothes, selling them, partying in famous bars in Los Angeles and burglarizing again. Oh, they're so brazen about their actions that they even posted their photos holding the stolen goods on the web!<br />That's all the movie was about. The actors did not use the real names of the thieves.<br />In reality, they all got a slap on  their wrists as punishments.<br /><br />It is much more interesting and factual to watch Bling Ring on American Greeds episode even though it lasts only 23 minutes.<br /><br />According to boxofficemojo dot com, below are the financial figures of this movie:<br /><br />Production Budget: N/A<br />Domestic:  $5,845,732<br />+ Foreign:  $13,300,000<br />= Worldwide:  $19,145,732<br /><br />According to hollywoodreporter dot com, Bling Ring's budget was 8 million dollars plus. So, it's a flop in North America. However, worldwide, it took in 9 million dollars more than its budget.<br /><br />In short, it's not worth it. I'm glad I borrowed it from my local library instead of renting it.
039916409X|5.0|This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to clear out their limiting beliefs about money.  Think you don't have any limiting beliefs?  Well, prepare yourself to be blown away by Magaret's work.  She presents the material in a simple and easy to follow way.  Anyone can do this---honest!  I've been familiar with her work for several years now (don't miss her video \\"tapping for $50,000) and taken one of her online classes with terrific results.  I'm an EFT professional myself and every time I do some of Margaret's work I get virtually instant (within a day or so) results...yep....every single time.  You will too.  Buy this book--buy several copies and give them for Christmas (I did).  This is really the gift that will keep on giving.  Margaret ROCKS!
B008JFUR10|4.0|What are Special Effects? You should see Pacific Rim to Experience What They Mean.<br />Of course there were other movies with excellent special effects too but they were in the past. Pacific Rim is available right now. It was released on Bluray, a day ago, Oct. 15, 2013.<br /><br />It's all about the special effects. This film will make your high definition, large screen TV worth the money.<br />The robots and the fighting scenes are life-like and exciting. The monsters' impression is mixed. Sometimes they look impressive. Sometimes they look like giant plastic, air-filled animals.<br /><br />It's predictable. That's true.<br />There's no time for character developments. That's true.<br /><br />According to boxofficemojo dot com, below are the financial figures of this film:<br /><br />Production Budget: $190 million<br />Domestic:  $101,794,729<br />+ Foreign:  $305,800,000<br />= Worldwide:  $407,594,729<br /><br />So, it's a big flop in North America. It lost approximately 88 million dollars. However, worldwide, it took in 217 million dollars more than its production cost. That's a gigantic amount.<br /><br />In short, it's interesting to watch.
1878424319|5.0|It has been about 6 months since I first read this book and I can say that it has had a lasting positive effect on me.  One of the best ideas from the book is learning that everyone is stuck in their own dream.  This idea has allowed me to stop taking things personally and to start concentrating on discovering the things in my life that are the false expectations of the world.  I used this idea when I was having trouble teaching a class, then I realized that I was trying to live up to false expectations.  When I was able to mentally free myself to do things my way, the class got much better and I was much happier.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|I enjoyed this book a lot.  The characters were great - I enjoyed spending time with them.  I loved that Allen - the 100 year old man - was so humble and easy going about EVERYTHING. Leaves you wondering whether he is truley brilliant or just ignorant and lucky - which made it all the more fun.  Grab a seat and enjoy the adventure with the crazy cast of characters.  Great book to put you in a good mood.
B00785P2QC|4.0|not too shabby... a little slow but it is ok. it has been free so far hopefully it stays that way.
B000O77SOK|5.0|I have always loved this show. It is probably the only show of David Kelly (other than Picket Fences) that I dont have more than Season 1. I love it
B004GYY714|5.0|very nice enjoyable able to pick what type music i want to listen to oh & guess what it's free
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|An illuminating version of Jesus the Revolutionary, not the Christ, and how his life has been misrepresented for the last 1980 years. A brave work.  Examines the four gospels and the unlikely emergence of Paul as the strongest remnant of Jesus, as well as the marginalization of James, the brother of Jesus.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|i didn't understand the concept & it just didn't jive with me.  i like games to make me smile not to make me nervous
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|After seeing the movie every year since I was a child (64 years), I found the book somewhat different and very good.  There were slight differences but it didn't bother my, especially since the book was written first.  Not w bit disappointed.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|We have watched all the series and now collect them, its a great series with the right amount of humour and drama. Keep it going.
B00EIL7E9C|4.0|I unlike  most of the people here I came in on true blood just as season 2 was getting started and it gave me time to watch season 1 and catch up. So with that being said I have been a fan ever since and although this was a good season, I agree that it kinda went off on a tangent and left some stories underdeveloped. I didn't get the same love for the series like I did with season 1-5 but I hate that next season will be the last. There were so many new characters that I felt weren't very important and took away from what the story was about. I don't know how season 7 will start but I hate HATE that it will be the last. I can't wait to see how it will ends because I am left with so many unanswered questions especially the end of season 6. Eric oh eric what will become of him?
B00F5FEZTC|5.0|Elton John has written the soundtrack for my life. At every turn from pre-adolescence to now, there has been an Elton John album, 8-track, cassette, CD and now thumbdrive, living in my musical device. So I'm obviously a bit biased with my 5-stars.<br /><br />What's fun about &#34;The Diving Board,&#34; as Elton has stated, is his own experimentation with minimal instrumentation. When you don't have a full band behind you, that puts pressure on you, as the keyboard becomes the main musical focus. Elton does not disappoint. His piano playing has never been better than it is on this collection...and considering the time span of his career, we're talking a LONG time. And while there's no &#34;jump up and dance, rock-it&#34; type music here, there is some toe tapping that goes one...and sometimes, these days that more than good enough. T-Bone Burnett adds his own special flavor as producer, but never to the point of drawing attention away from the work.And the lyrics bring the imagery and emotion one would expect from the master wordsmith Bernie Taupin (again I'm biased because his work with Elton has been such a big part of my entire life).
B003O86FMW|4.0|Quite a good book but the first was way better the series it kind of getting slow. But still a great book
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The third book went better than the second and glad they lived happily ever after.<br />Look forward to more from this author.
B008VBYN80|4.0|I really enjoy this game. Build your kingdom, build up troops, gather materials, even grow crops, plus if your crops whither you don't lose any money you just get your cost back. The battle system is fun, certain troops work better against certain troops. My only complaint is the need for &quot;diamonds&quot; which you have to slowly slowly save, or purchase with real money. There are even a few quests that require you to spend large amounts of these. But it isn't a must to progress in the game so they only lost one star for it. It's a good one especially without a fee to purchase the actual game. One last thing, you need e edgy to do most things and it can go fast, but it recharges fairly quickly, so not a huge problem, just don't plan on playing for hours at a time without a few breaks. I play this and Dragonvale, and another lil breeding game while at dialysis for 3and 1/2 3days a week.
B007SVPZMW|3.0|Even at level Hard, \\"Computer\\" makes rookie's errors. It's like it's letting me win, which is insulting.<br />Developer, please improve AI, this game could be lots of fun if improved
B0094M4R3Q|4.0|Not really HD quality but a lot cleaner than SD.  Plus widscreen makes it look even better.  I watched it on a 47 inch tv and it looks nice.
B00B2166BS|5.0|This cable is great! I can charge my Nexus in much less time than using the charging cable that came with it. I have had no problems with it and have had it for several months.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|The game is fun to play, but it really shouldn't qualify as &quot;free&quot; for those of us with less patience. like many similar games, it is free, but uses long building construction times to urge the player to purchase medals to speed that aspect up. If you like a great strategy game, but don't mind either waiting a while or paying a little, this is for you. On a side note, my least favorite aspect has to be the auto notifications. They can kick you out of videos, apparently.
0064404994|3.0|Was there a reference to &#34;wireless&#34; in this book just thrown in there randomly as an attempt to modernize the story?  Why?  Made me cringe.  I am hoping I read it wrong.

B0097AQEOK|5.0|I'm not using this space to rant about the greatness and wonder that is Joni. This package is fantastic, mini albums with original artwork and design including in some cases the handwritten lyrics.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|I heard the song In a World Like This on a TV show and also on the radio. I liked the song enough to buy the CD. I like all the songs on the CD. I am very happy and satisfied that I bought this CD. I recommend this CD to anyone, especially if you like the Backstreet Boys previous songs.
B00C32R64G|4.0|This is my first Volbeat CD and I was impressed.  I mainly got it for their single &#34;The hangman's body count&#34; but found out there are a lot of other good songs.  I enjoy the Western spin on all the songs and think they did a great job incorporating it into each song.  Not to mention they covered Young the Giant's &#34;My Body&#34; which is pretty cool too.
B00FJTWK0U|1.0|The preview gave me high hopes and so did the first 30 minutes. It started out witty, funny and enjoyable. Then it took a turn for the worse. It relied heavily on sexual humor and tasteless nudity. By the end of it, I was confused as to the direction they took with this movie that had a lot of potential and frankly I wish I had walked out before it ended. Most other's in the theater had similar reactions afterwards in the lobby. Very disappointed.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The Husband's Secret by Liane Moriarty is a great read. She managed to suck me into the lives of three women, all in various stages of hard times. These characters and their families pop off the pages with the author's wonderful words. I love it when I get swept away by a book. I think these characters will be with me for a while. Definitely a must read!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|it good I like playing it but I think they need to make were u can get more peanuts without having to pay. other then that it's fun
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great fast paced game that's awesome is you love the despicable me movies. Only thing is it lags sometimes and to get the costumes can take forever if you don't want to pay any money
1476727651|5.0|Great story. I don't know where King gets his wonderful ideas from but its well worth reading. Haven't been disappointed yet with a Stephen King book.
B005FLX1KK|5.0|Im not a huge skrillex fan, but I saw this at a local record store and was too curious as to how dubstep would sound on vinyl. It sounds AMAZING no distortion at all! Plus if anyone who is a fan of dubstep sees it, instantly you become badass of the year. Buy this in vinyl it is well worth the extra money.

0812982622|5.0|I cannot say enough great things about this book.  It starts with a jolt and continues to get better and better.  I feel that I finally have some comprehension of North Korea and I can only pray for those citizens captured behind its iron curtain of propaganda, scarcity and terror.  The hero is an everyman who seeks truth without even realizing he is doing so.  His loyalty and love of country make him the true patriot and yet he is tortured at every turn for this.  Human relationships are brilliantly described, parent, child, husband wife, friend, co-worker all submissive to the apparatus of the state. Despite this the love story at its center is perfection.  A more horrifying glimpse of what Big Brother can do and is actually doing than the fictional \\"1984\\".  The author won the Pulitzer, clearly deserved!  Best book of the year and perhaps decade.  Read it now as a cautionary tale.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Good book stephen king still has it. Exciting from beginning to end and an excellent sequel.<br />I was very satisfied.

B00EO4SBSG|4.0|No it's not as good as Shogun.  Now that that's out of the way...<br /><br />This album is better than In Waves, about on par with The Crusade.  There is no mistaking Dramian's influence here, particularly on Heafy's vocals. Lots of vibrato and wailing etc... Hell, the album artwork (which I f'n love by the way) even has hints of DD's influence. The guitar work is still very satisfying and, surprisingly Heafy seems to help contribute to the shredding on this one contrary to what he said in some of the interviews before release. Drums are forgettable.  Servicable but nothing special.  Lot's of typical double bass runs.<br /><br />3 random thoughts to add:<br /><br />1) Please, Matt, stop trying to make tough guy metal face in your music videos.  You did the same thing for In Waves and it's just not working dude.  You have a baby face.  It's ok.  I do too.  All your jaw clenching makes you look like a really thin \\"The Rock\\", and not in a good way.<br /><br />2) Thank god they didn't continue with the theme from In Waves.  The DVD that came with that release was terrible and it was clear to me that the rest of the band was just humoring Heafy with his vision.<br /><br />3) Love the album art on this one.  Those Trivium robot things looks super badass and I hope I can buy a shirt with one of them on it when I see them next month.

B00992CF6W|5.0|for you all who think that the pe version should have any of the same stuff in the Pc. you need to know that the iphone. ipod. ipad. kindles. don't have even close to the same amount of proccesing power that a Pc has. I love minecraft. I think that cuz of the lack of features that I feel sorry for all the people who think minecraft is just this. if u like this then u should try the Pc.

039916409X|5.0|I met Margaret last year at Transform Conference, and I've been very impressed with both her skill and desire to help others.<br /><br />Recently, I began an expensive online marketing course and began to realize that I was holding myself back through some semi-conscious and unconscious, limiting beliefs about money...my worthiness to enjoy success and the safety of having enough...on and on. OK, I knew part of that on some level. But I'd never been able to remove and redo those beliefs.<br /><br />Margaret's book was released at the exact time I needed deep, knowledgeable and actionable help. Bravo!<br /><br />I look forward to great changes in freedom and progress. I'm thankful that Margaret stuck with her dream and has developed her gifts to share with us!

B00821PCJS|2.0|I am a fan of science fiction and if that describes you then you may truly enjoy this series but I found it a bit too derivative and predictable.

B00DYFCYSO|5.0|This was a great arrangement of music, some totally typical in the Legend style, but saw much more maturity in some of the tunes. It's amazing what love can do.
B00908DDZM|5.0|The Heist has a different kind of vibe, but it's got catchy beats. The songs have a message to them, which I really appreciate. The musicianship is extraordinary!
B00BIVN82M|4.0|More Buble is  never a bad thing. Songs were typical Michael Buble, but you can tell by the tone's he is a man in love with wife and new child - you can feel the ahhhhhhhh in his songs.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|. . . This is a good CD !!  Will you hear any of the songs on the radio? Probably not. Why? Because they're by Paul McCartney and he is always measured against the Beatles and isn't 20-something anymore. If you put out the song &#34;New&#34; as a single without listing the artist, it could chart on the Pop Charts. If you put out the song &#34;Appreciate&#34; as a single without listing the artist, it could chart on the FM Charts and if you put out the song &#34;Get Me Out Of Here&#34; as a single without listing the artist, it could chart on the Country Charts. The CD showcases the songwriting versatility of Mr. McCartney as it encompasses many styles and sounds. Despite what some of the reviews say, the vocals are fine with, in my opinion, one exception: on the song &#34;Early Days&#34; (which is a nice reminiscing song, Beatle People), the vocals are in a high register and lower register; I think the song would have been better served if it had simply been sung in the lower register. That one small reservation stated (and I certainly couldn't sing the song better than Mr. McCartney did), this is a solid CD which deserves to be played, listened to and enjoyed. Two Thumbs Up !!
0670024856|5.0|From the opening pages, it is evident that Gilbert can write with lyricism, confidence, and substance. I was afraid that her mass popularity would lead to a dumbed down book with pandering social/political agendas or telegraphed notions. I am thrilled to conclude that this was not the case. Gilbert is a superb writer who allows her main characters to spring forth as organically as the natural world that they live in. This is a book of well-considered people of the times, who are emblematic of daring and discerning ideas, as well as an absorbing story that will keep the pages flying. The 18th and 19th century comes to life, and botany keeps the composite parts anchored to the earth. It is a both beautiful and intermittently appalling story of humanity and nature.<br /><br />The book begins with British ex-pat Henry Whittaker, a boy of humble origins, who, by the time he is an adult in the 19th century, turns himself into a captain of industry in the botanical and pharmaceutical industry, particularly quinine. As a boy, he pilfered from the Royal Botanical Kew Gardens and sold to others, and showed his mettle as an entrepreneur. The director, Sir Joseph Banks, eventually apprehended him. Whittaker's penance was to be sent on faraway travels, in order to prove himself worthy and edify himself in the realm of plants.<br /><br />When Whittaker returned, he made it his life's work to eclipse Banks and become a wealthy self-made industrialist of the natural world. He got himself an educated Dutch wife, left Europe for good, and settled in Western Pennsylvania, where he built an elaborate estate that truly did rival the Kew Gardens, called White Acre. All alike envied his ostentatious mansion on the hill, and were impressed by his breathtaking, unparalleled gardens. He sired one daughter, Alma, and adopted another, Prudence. Whittaker became one of the richest men in North America, or anywhere. But, more important than riches, to him, was the power to command others, and the talent and skill to master your work. Education was the tool to that end. Therefore, his children received a scholarly education at home.<br /><br />Henry's prominence on the pages segues into his daughter's, Alma. The beautiful Prudence becomes an outspoken abolitionist, while Alma grows into a scholarly, tall, large-boned, homely, and privately carnal woman who becomes the flourishing main character. I would list her as one of my favorite protagonists of contemporary times, as unforgettable as Teresita Urrea of THE HUMMINGBIRD'S DAUGHTER, although of polar sensibilities. Alma is so fleshed out that I can smell her, and every moment in her life is organically rendered. As she becomes her father's daughter as a scientist, (but with a gentler disposition), the reader is taken ever further into her inner and outer journeys. She is not just a botanist and taxonomist, but in many ways, a philosopher, a noble thinker, with a sexual and sensual hunger.<br /><br />Gilbert doesn't portray Alma as flawless or unbelievable. Rather, Alma is a construct of her environment and her gifted mind. She is also metaphorically imprisoned by the life of a proper woman in the 19th century. However...<br /><br />Alma's portrait is the fruit of this elegantly written, lyrically cadenced, engrossing tale. Gilbert braids in the enigma of life from botany to the human body, and folds in science, mysticism, spirituality, psycho-sexuality, all in a vibrantly flowing historical novel. Some of the characters make a brief or lucid appearance, and then fade, but Alma grows more luminous with each passing chapter. A few sections focus on scientific philosophies and the question of creationism and evolution (the way a discussion would happen in the 1800's), but it fits radiantly into this story. But, mostly, it is Alma who pollinates this ripe and exhilarating tale. I still see her bending over a leaf, or examining moss with a microscope, or hunched over her scholarly tomes and writing her books onthe mysteries of plant life. Being at her father's beck and call, but carving out a solitary but teeming life.<br /><br />The title of the book refers that all life contains a divine code or print, and was put forth by a 16th century German cobbler and early botanist, Jacob Boehme, one rejected by the Whittakers, for the most part, as medieval nonsense. He had mystical visions about plants, and believed there was a divine code in \\"every flower, leaf, fruit, and tree on earth. All the natural world was a divine code.\\"<br />You can see it in a curling leaf, a nesting bird, and when the stamens of one plant stick it to its receptacle. Every unique living creature, according to Boehme, contains the eponymous title. Alma meets an orchid painter who embodies this belief, and who pulls her into the world of mysticism. As an explorer and thinker, she is compelled to understand this notion.<br /><br />Alma's professional and personal life leads her to contemplate the \\"struggle for existence.\\" As the reader follows Alma on her odyssey of the natural world and beyond, the wonder of life becomes ever transcendent--that \\"those who survived the world shaped it--even as the world, simultaneously, shaped them.\\"<br /><br />This exquisite novel feels like a gift to humanity. It has heart, soul, and earthiness. And Alma Whittaker.the mysteries of plant life.

Every unique living creature, according to Boehme, contains the eponymous title. Alma meets an orchid painter who embodies this belief, and who pulls her into the world of mysticism. As an explorer and thinker, she is compelled to understand this notion.<br /><br />Alma's professional and personal life leads her to contemplate the \\"struggle for existence.\\" As the reader follows Alma on her odyssey of the natural world and beyond, the wonder of life becomes ever transcendent--that \\"those who survived the world shaped it--even as the world, simultaneously, shaped them.\\"<br /><br />This exquisite novel feels like a gift to humanity. It has heart, soul, and earthiness. And Alma Whittaker.

B00EO4SBSG|5.0|This is by far the best metal release of the year, great riffs, great vocals, strong lyrics, just a powerful work of art. Trivium is one of the most talented metal bands on the scene today and I feel that this record not only expresses that but solidifies it. They've put out four tremendous records (I don't really like The Crusade) and this one is the fifth. Matt Heafy's vocals have improved ten fold since working with David Draiman. I do hear hints of disturbed but I think Trivium were welcoming to some of that epic advice that Draiman could offer. I don't like to compare works of art to previous records so I will be reviewing this based solely on this effort. Here's a song by song review.<br /><br />1. \\"Brave This Storm\\" 9/10 - Very powerful opening song, the first single released, just a tremendous piece that shows both technical prowess and an ability to right a radio friendly, clever tune. It took awhile for me to accept this song because it sounds so different but I was promised big riffs by Trivium and that's what I received.<br /><br />2. \\"Vengeance Falls\\" 10/10 - The vocals are very powerful in this song, very good use of screams, the chorus is very catchy, it's just a masterpiece. The riffage is technical, the drums are very quick and well guided. The one thing that I dislike on that entire record is how sometimes sounds blend and that's the production team's fault. For the most part though, I think the production is solid.<br /><br />3. \\"Strife\\" 10/10 - I was hooked on the first listen. The lyrics are strong, I love Heafy's voice during the verses. This song has the most production problems mostly heard within the first thirty seconds of the song in the opening riff. The guitar is poorly mastered and their are very small skips in sound. The song itself is a monster, the chorus is brilliant, the solo is strong, just a very good piece of music.<br /><br />4. \\"No Way to Heal\\" 9/10 - The riffs are sick, I hear some Shogun, sorry for referencing a previous record. The drums are very powerful, the chorus is very adaptable. It's strong and very radio friendly. Great song.<br /><br />5. \\"To Believe\\" 10/10 - The opening of the song is strong, the verse is so potent, it sounds a lot like Disturbed but I love the constant riff changes. The chorus is a little repetitive but it's effective. The guitar solo features some double axe attack, gotta love it. Tremendous song!<br /><br />6. \\"At The End of This War\\" 10/10 - Beautiful acoustic opening, Heafy's vocals have improved so much and it's apparent in this song. When the riffs begin, everything turns into a masterpiece. The verses are so well put together, so much power. The chorus is strong. What a song, it's just so unique and I'm glad that Trivium made such a strong record.<br /><br />7. \\"Through Blood and Dirt and Bone\\" 9/10 - Once again, the riffs are so potent. This might be my least favorite song on the record but that means nothing because it's still an epic piece of music. I find the verses a little dry, the lyrics are a little mediocre but that's all fixed with a great bridge and chorus.<br /><br />8. \\"Villainy Thrives\\" 10/10 - The second best song on the record, the open riff is beautiful. The verses are fast-paced, brutal, and the vocals are so angry. The chorus is beyond anything I've ever heard, it's catchy but so heavy. I can't really find the words to describe this song, it's just such a great piece of music. Love the placement of the screams.<br /><br />9. \\"Incineration: A Broken World\\" 11/10 - Best song on the record, maybe of all time. At first, I thought it was a typical Trivium song but I heard so much more. Yes, the riffs are brutal, the vocals are strong, the lyrics are effective, it's just that extra power that makes this song amazing. The guitar solo is brilliant, I just could not live without this song. The extra power behind the vocals in the final chorus is probably what does it.<br /><br />10. \\"Wake (The End is Nigh)\\" 10/10 - Beautiful intro, the lyrics are dark but beautiful. I love a song that progresses and builds up to an epic level and that's what this song does. This is a perfect closer to an almost perfect record. Thank you Trivium for this amazing listening experience.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album to metal fans, loyal Trivium fans, and awesome people who know what great music is. Thank you for reading, enjoy!
