B00CEF014E|5.0|A great psychological thriller A very original and entertaining thriller. You have to pay attention as there are some cool twists. There’s a lot going on here. I loved the central idea: is she crazy or not? Great stuff!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I loved the ps3 version of plants vs. zombies and when i saw this for tablet I just had to have it. My son is always trying to steal the game from me when I am playing it.
B00F57VFXO|5.0|A fast-paced and unpredictable story line makes for an exciting read. I didn’t know much about Ian Fleming’s life but it seems that he had quite a fun time as a spy. The ending was completely unexpected. Overall, a well written and very original book.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|kept me riveted - was hard to put down . Very well written.  The chapters are laid out well and doesn't jump around a lot like some writers
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Very addictive and fun to play, but after 35 levels, they charge you to go on.  It's only $.99, but I didn't expect it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a fun read for me, Christian and Ana. Those loving each other too much to leave and troubles popping up.<br />Most people love a love story and those two have one. Ana pulling him into the light with love and patience .<br />As you see it's all about love and happily ever after .
B000THKAR2|5.0|B-rate horror music at it's best. The Misfits are truly a love or hate band, but the Danzig era songs are a cut above the rest.
1426308469|5.0|Excellent book with nice bright photos with captions for each photo.  Will definitely keep my niece entertained without overwhelming her with too many words.
B00EJX2YGM|5.0|This truly is a beautiful set of movies. I have never seen anything quite like it. Such an awesome and enchanting presentation all in one very special box with Edward & Bella on one side and Jacob on the other. I would not consider myself a Twi-Hard fan of the saga but I do love this series. Plus I am a movie collector and I love Special Items like these. Met all my expectations and more. I do recommend this.
B00BEF1AEK|4.0|Very fun play action through the levels, which have been described in other reviews. There are two annoyances though, which is why I can't give it a five star rating.<br /><br />1. There is a huge battery drain, such that my android stayed very warm in my hand all the time.<br /><br />2.  There is no way to close the app when you are ready to quit for the day. Not even repeatedly hitting the back button works. You have to hit the home button, or open task manager and kill it (the home button only gets you out, not close the app).<br /><br />Other than these two issues, this is a very fun game and I would recommend it.
0446572985|4.0|I got this book as an e-book and I enjoyed reading it. At times, I did find it hard to put the book down. I often read for 2hrs that felt like 30 minutes. Time went by fast. Just a heads up: if you're like me, don't care too much for an extensive amount of narration, you may find your interest to sway like a pendulum just a bit. For the first 13 or 14 chapters, it's about 95% narration. Initially, I started to discontinue my reading the book in its entirety but my intuitive side told me to bare with it and keep reading. I am so content that I did. After those chapters, the dialogue really kicks in and then a balance between narration and dialogue surfaces. It was great because then I truly felt I could enjoy the book more.<br /><br />I have to say that there isn't a great amount of character development in this book. That isn't at all a negative statement. There isn't much character development BECAUSE the characters in this book are SOLID. Everyone stays in character pretty much and nearly everyone is interesting. Robie does slightly change from being the distant, bad ass man that he is to STILL being a bad ass but slightly more open and less closed off.<br /><br />I may possibly pick up the other books by this author or at least bookmark them in my mind for a later date to read them. This was my first book I've read by this author and so far it has been an enjoyable experience.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I  have to admit this is one seriously addictive game.<br />. You don't realize it until it's to late. Each level gets you more and more obsessed. It is so much fun!!!!!
0316074314|5.0|Firmly in the tradition of Wilkie Collins and to a lesser extent Dickens, this swirling novel encapsulates all the great themes of universal literature:  love, death, sex, good and evil. An excellent delineation of addiction, unlike David Foster Wallace's masterpiece, Infinite Jest, not rooted in a postmodern idiom, it is wise, churlish, witty and by the end of the novel, a good friend on a cold winter's night. This is why I read literature. To not only entertain me, but to surprise me, enlighten me and to stimulate me. What a great book.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I honestly thought this movie was the summer blockbuster that was overlooked by most audiences.  Star Trek Into Darkness is a movie that gradually builds out the characters a bit more than in Star Trek.  The movie didn't deviate too far from the original, it kept the same formula.<br /><br />This witty banter with the crew, make it fun to watch.  While the villain does an amazing job of being likable though you want to hate him.  You relate to him, though he eventually becomes so maniacal that you want him to lose.<br /><br />The story was fantastic, the cast were exceptional, though it felt like it drags a bit towards the end it was a good movie.
0446691437|5.0|This is a great read.  Had a significant impact, well written, and an easy read for anyone who wants to make a big change in their approach to writing, art, and everyday life.
B00CL0J99K|3.0|Iron Man 3 was a step in a better direction then Iron Man 2.  Except the movie felt generic, bland, and lackluster.  The movies story was mediocre, just enough to move the movie along.  Then it felt like certain action sequences were added for the sake of action sequences.<br /><br />For non comic fans the switch with the Mandarin not being a real villain, simply an actor may have been okay.  Unfortunately I know a bit about the Mandarin and he is one of the best villains for Iron Man.  Which was disappointing that he was wasted in the manner he was.<br /><br />However even with the movies mishaps Robert Downey Jr. delivers another performance to life.  The movie was vastly entertaining and enjoyable.  The humor and action were placed correctly, in a way that the movie doesn't feel long.  Which make it a fun movie to go see.<br /><br />When the movie is done you won't be like &#34;Whoa! That was amazing&#34; or &#34;Whoa! What a horrible movie.&#34;  You'll be left somewhere in the middle, where you won't be sorry you saw it but it isn't anything to write home about either.  It was a step in the right direction for the character though hopefully it continues to get better and doesn't turn into Iron Man 2.
B008JFUO72|4.0|I am a huge fan of Marvel and Iron man and also was as usual satisfied with the special effects
B00BGI08GG|5.0|When the announcement came out for an origin story of Arrow I was a bit skeptical.  Mostly because Smallville, started strong but quickly became a love triangle and soap opera for quite a few seasons.  Before the formula changed for the show and it became a better interpretation of the character.<br /><br />Luckily for me these writers got the formula right, they deliver two congruent stories simultaneously which adds extra complexity and characterization to the character.  They built individual episodes that latter into one giant story throughout the season.  This makes the fun a blast to watch, even the episodes that are designed to introduce and build out the story a bit more (those slow, painful episodes) Arrow makes pretty enjoyable.<br /><br />The pace of the show is quick, which keeps most who watch it entertained and wanting more.  I would highly recommend this show, it is designed to be a darker drama and story which make it a great show to follow.
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|Just as good as the original Star Trek II with a lot more of a  deeper story line and nice twist as well
B008JFUUQ2|4.0|This movie is quite enjoyable.  A decent story, humor, and enjoyable.  An enjoyable film to watch with friends or family when you want something light to watch.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game is very fun and addicting. But I suggest not getting it. When you lose lives it takes one and a half hours to get them back. It is free but it begs for your money. It is what I call a one week addiction game: you are obsessed with it for a short time and then you may as well delete it because it just gets boring.
B00CH87HF4|2.0|this was a really good game until i connected it to facebook, then it started crashing and now its to the point where i cant even play it anymore.... complete and total bs
006202406X|4.0|I read this with as much zeal as each of the other two books. I'm happy with how this series ended and I don't think there would've been any truer way to conclude the book, given the thread of learning about sacrifice that permeates all three books and the conclusion that Tris reaches about what it means to give the ultimate gift to the people you love. She did what she had to do for those she cared about most and everyone is able to go on because of it. I think this has been a fantastic conclusion to an amazing series. Thank you, Ms. Roth!
B00AFEX83C|5.0|This is an awesome movie and it is great for ages to watch. Just hope that our niece and nephew like them as we bought as Christmas gifts.
B005LAII0I|5.0|It was a Christmas gift for my daughter last year and she really liked it.She said it was a good movie.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Awesome Movie for the whole family. Has lots of action in it, if you like action movies. Bought as Christmas Gift
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I was trying to post this on the one that costs money but I don't have it don't buy the one that costs money buy this one there the same thing only difference is one costs money
B00E5I2M9K|5.0|Great Movie for kids, that love action heroes....Bought as a Christmas gift for our niece and nephew, so hoping that they like it..
0061438294|4.0|This is well written.  It makes many insights on overt behavior and conflicting patterns that people subconsciously do when nervous, interviewing, or being questioned by an ex-FBI agent.
B00E9ZATJO|5.0|Bought as Christmas gifts for our niece and nephew. We are really hoping that they will like it. The movie is great for people of all ages.
3833160454|4.0|This book shows how to size a foot well.  It can be very helpful for a wider foot. Food comfort is very hard to find in men's dress shoes. More modern websites and styles could be shown.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|High powered guns and killing animals have never been so much fun!  I'm hooked. Great graphics too. You'll really enjoy this one but it's expensive.
0688152023|5.0|This has great stretches that can help tone. It also looks very impressive on the coffee table. You might try just a few stretches at a time. You might feel sore the next day too.
1416550550|4.0|The story is told from three points of view: The Authoress from the late 1800‘s who wrote enchanting fairytales. Nell, the quiet and haunted woman who was abandoned as a child and has a past shrouded in mystery. Lastly, her granddaughter, Cassandra who will go to great lengths to uncover that shadowed, lost past. In the process she finds controversy, loss, loyalty, love and family. There is a fantasy quality to all three stories; darkness surrounding the biggest question in the book, why was Nell abandoned so suddenly by The Authoress. Deep rooted love expanding over a century between all the characters. The mystery wasn’t hard for me to figure out but I never lost interest in the story. I wanted to know what the characters would do once secrets were revealed. This book made me want to read Kate Morton’s other books.
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|I found this an enthralling story. Looking about my own modest property in Oroville California, one can see, beyond the native oak and pine, different flora from throughout the world, originally growing in, where?, the Middle East, Africa, South America, perhaps. Our main character, Alma, comes up with the same theory as Darwin, with the same fascinating flaw. Tahiti is well described and a major element in the plot.
B00FR0MM5Y|5.0|I have to ask, how many kids were conceived while this album was playing. A genuine work of art and Morrison at his best!
B0091W7K6K|5.0|Of the action stars of this era of film, Steve McQueen was always on top of his game as an actor.  Bullitt demonstrates his top acting skills, and delivers a great story.  This movie is one of the all time great classic's.  Very well written.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|so far so good. I like the game.  good graphics good play.  a job well done. keep up the good work and keep the games coming
B00F3VOL38|5.0|An interesting listen into the BBC live sessions by the Beatles. Like Vol. 1 from the 90s, Vol. 2 takes old Beatle BBC performances from the best quality source that can currently be found. Though a few tracks like &#34;I'm Talking About You&#34; are far from perfect sources, but for a historical point these tracks are quite good to listen too.<br /><br />The 2 CD set is beautifully packaged, yet it is quite difficult to remove the CDs from the digipak. Sliding the discs in and out over time will cause scratches on them which is a horrid thought for the price. The booklet is very well made and informational, yet its loose fit in the digipak makes it move about too much. For someone who likes to listen to this set on their stereo systems may find all this difficult to bare with while others who will rip the songs for their online/iPod/MP3 use may find it occasionally bothersome when they do use the CDs.<br /><br />The triple LP 180g vinyl set is superb to look at. The discs are well pressed and sound great. Like the CD digipak, the packaging looks amazing yet is plagued with a few issues. This tri-fold record set is easy to remove discs 1 and 3 and a bit difficult to remove disc 2 for it is in the center fold. But that is far from being bothersome than this next issue. When putting any disk with its inner-sleeve back into its cardboard jacket the inner-sleeve gets caught on the flip tabs on the inside of each disc portion of the jacket. Most of the struggle is with disc 2 for its awkward position. To get a disc in one has to hold the jacket in an awkward way possibly bending the jacket and/or letting one of the discs fall out. For the hefty price of this set a better design should have been thought of.<br /><br />The material and quality of each media is quite well and though the problems are bothersome, the artwork and sounds are amazingly beautiful. Was it worth the price? For a Beatles fan and rock enthusiast yes. For a new Beatle fan, save your money until you get more into the band and know you want to spend on them.<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful to buyers!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am only writing this because Mr. Howey said he reads all of his reviews on Amazon, and I wanted to take this opportunity to thank the author for such a great book! I enjoyed the writing style and pace of the book and will be buying more from this author soon.
B00BSBU4EC|2.0|While I enjoyed many of the cute characters in this movie, and thought the overall concept was creative, I felt many of the scenes were far too intense for young viewers, especially the &#34;nightmares&#34;. When you take characters some children believe in, such as Santa and the Tooth Fairy, and create an extremely frightening world they could also consider as real, I think it becomes too much. We didn't let our seven year old finish watching it.
B00ECJ18HO|4.0|Hound of the Baskervilles.  It was much better reading for such an old book than I had expexcted. I really enjoyed iot.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|This review contains spoilers...<br />This movie started of off with promise. The idea of fast-moving zombies gave a new aspect to an old story, and since I have small children I empathized with the father trying to help his family survive. Some of the graphics were spectacular, the wall in Israel scene was worth the whole movie. However, the chemistry between the husband and wife was non-existent and I didn't care one bit about their relationship. They killed off the most interesting character (the young scientist) before you could even give the man more than a half-smile for his witty observations. The zombies were campy and silly when they shouldn't have been. And the 'solution' in the end was ridiculous and full of loopholes. The only reason I give it two stars was for the wall and the young Israeli soldier.
B000VSBX34|5.0|its amazing! if you loved a hard days night then you absolutely love help. the story line is wonderful and the beatles are hillarious plus its in color!
B00CHVJI08|5.0|great movie for ALL ages !!  I always watch the movie on Amazon and then decide if I want to buy it !
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I honestly wasn't a big fan of the Avatar movie back when it came out, but after seeing it in 3D on our 80 inch Sharp Quattron, it was absolutely stunning! This became the go-to showboat movie for the 3D experience!
B00008IHN1|5.0|I bought this because one of my grandchildren has become interested in playing the drums. The remarkable talent of the players in the movie impressed her.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|This is the best album yet that Em and Dr Dre have released! Absolutely Brilliant! If you are an Em fan, go ahead and click download!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Awesome read. I could not guess the ending. I would say more but I do not want to give the story away. If you like romance, drama, and suspense...this is the book for you.
B00BAXFAJC|5.0|Long, well-developed, interesting, a time new to me.  only half-way through and loving it.  easy to pick up and follow.<br />UPDATE:  Finished it, a full month of entertainment!  Sorry to get to 100% on my Kindle....wanted to have the characters still available, maybe a sequel or spin-off.<br />Keep at it Ms Catton...please be as prolific as Mitchener.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|the book is awesome!  the author must be throwing up blood when she saw how much was cut in the movie. Will go and read the rest of the series too.
B0051SDM5Q|5.0|The book was helpful, enlightening, practical and it boosted my creativity and imagination. I think many people working for the Government (not all) could learn how to better communicate with the taxpayers. After all we pay their wages!
B000LB4DWO|3.0|Superman has always been a timeless movie.  This movie gives tribute to a great series, but it went stale after Superman III.  The casting was very good.  Routh does a convincing job of playing Superman.  It doesn't take much...of all the comic super heros, Superman has the least amount of personality.  The biggest highlight of the movie is Kevin Spacey's brilliant performance with Lex Luther.  Spacey does a superb job of drawing you into Luther's brilliant evil mind by being likable and pragmatic.  It's refreshing to see a villian who wants to rule the world for the sake of money and power instead of being a revenge-driven nutjob.  Without Lex Luther, this movie would probably have been a flop.  The plot is mediocre and overdone.  Superman's jealousy is overdone.  It's nice to see Superman show some human emotions, but what is Lois supposed to do?...wait 5 years for Superman to come back?  She doesn't even know his name!  What would really be funny is if Superman told her his secret...&#34;You mean to tell me that I had sex with you, you still wouldn't tell me your name, and you're JUST NOW telling me that we've been co-workers at the Daily Planet...for HOW MANY years?&#34;
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I found this book very easy to read and hard to put down. The book was written so well, it really allowed you to understand the thought process going on inside Don's head.
B005LJITS0|2.0|Writing a movie from a super hero comic book doesn't always work.  This is an example of that, but the screenplay makes it worse. The movie starts off with Hal Jordan, a shallow test pilot working for a government contractor.  He's reckless and has a history of job hopping...but somehow people continue to hire him as a test pilot.  After crashing a $1 billion dollar fighter jet, he gets fired.  Who knew?<br /><br />A purple alien crash lands on Earth and the green energy scoops-up Jordan and flys him over to the alien ship.  The ship and the alien look fake, like they came from the scene of a video game...wait, that's what actually happened!  Hal takes the ring, puts it on, and the ring transports him across a bunch of galaxies to an alien planet.  He gets his butt kicked during training, so he quits.<br /><br />The plot gets more absurd when a professor pricks himself with the yellow stuff in the alien's dead body.  This somehow turns him into a mad scientist super villian with a big-ugly frog face that wants to rule the world.  We don't even know who this guy is or why he now wants to rule the world.<br /><br />The frog-face wants to start killing people, even though he has no real motive.  He causes the helicopter to spin out of control. Wait..look up in the sky!  It's green lantern to save the day!  The helicopter AND the damsel are saved.<br /><br />Frog face is mad that his plot to kill people for fun was thwarted, so he kills his dad and other government officials in a science lab.  Wait...look up in the sky!  It's Green Lantern.  Uh oh, Frog face guy stole the damsel and she's in DISTRESS!  What are we going to do?  Green Lantern manages to save the day again!  Who knew?<br /><br />Funny though, Frog face isn't even the real villian.  The real villian is Parallax, who is a big blob of fear floating around the universe eating people.  Naturally, Earth is next.  The blob reaches earth and kills Frog face.  The fight between Green Lantern and the blob is too ridiculous to describe with a straight face.  It ends with Green Lantern punching the blob in the face with a big green fist right into the sun.<br /><br />Overall, the movie comes acoss as lame and predictible.  There is no real victory in defeating Parallax because there is no real personal sacrifice that makes Green Lantern true hero.  A true hero is a martyr that goes against the established customs at great personal risk for the greater good.  Spiderman is a nerdy college kid that fights crime part time, even at risk of his grades and his future.  Captain Kirk defies orders and ignores the &#34;prime directive,&#34; often risking a court marshall to save Earth and the Federation.  Without that, Green Lantern is just another super hero.  The only difference is that he's green.
B00DSOG0QS|5.0|I love mysteries and this book makes me want to read more. This book has it all. Mystery, Romance, excitement, heck you name it has it. Great book and I'm looking forward to the second one. Get Writing Mr. Ketkar.
B00BAXFAJC|3.0|It is not easy reading. The language is very stilted and too much repeated discriptions. Then there is the thing of keeping  charactors straight.
0812982622|5.0|Even though fiction, a brilliantly researched novel into the North Korean scene.  While shocking and disturbing it forces the reader to really take a look at his or her life and think deeply about what really matters.
B003UYUP58|5.0|This book is a great reading to learn about many 'nonscientific' sides of the war on cancer. I enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it enthusiastically.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|it's such a great movie and my son enjoyed the picture quality. Everything that came with it was a bounus.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|my wife and i enjoy the series, but it is getting a little old. they need to leave the prison soon.
B00GMONG90|5.0|On the whole, this is a wonderful album and a certain buy if you like Pentatonix.<br />1. Can't Hold Us is a good beginning song. It's a cover, but you couldn't tell since they make it their own.<br />2. Natural Disaster follows well. An original.<br />4. Valentine. Honestly...not my favorite song, but Pentatonix does a good job with it.<br />5. Hey Momma/Hit the Road Jack is well done. Again,not my absolute fave, but I won't skip it.<br />6. I Need Your Love is just ok. Won't skip it, but I won't really remember it either.<br />7. Run To You is amazing. I would almost buy the album just for this song. And it's an original. It starts low and slow, often giving off this old Hymn/Spiritual vibe before it just soars and I'm almost in tears. May or may not have broken my repeat button.<br />8. Daft Punk is incredibly catchy, and I've never heard any of these songs before.<br />9.Dont You Worry Child is a great end to the album.<br /><br />There are a few songs that aren't absolutely brilliant, but the quality of the album is still very strong. Worth the money.
0345803450|1.0|The most boring book (out of many thousands) that I have ever read. Shades of 'the emperor's new clothes' from readers. Once authors are established, the publishers will ensure that they can get away with a poor plot. One doesn't need to like characters; but they should be consistent and believable.
B008KNUKVI|5.0|A wonderful album to start with. I really enjoyed their arrangements, they know how to use everyone's voices to their best ability. Perhaps a few songs more would have been nicer, but as they now have out a second album I can forgive them.
B00BB8T9FC|4.0|That the young orphan was taught how to be a doctor was very interesting.  If only all orphanages were run this way, life would be so much better for children.

1250038820|5.0|I love as I love the facebook page and the blog.<br />The book came 1 week earlier then amazon predicted.<br />It could've been better wrapped because it came in a sort of cardbord envelope that was not sealed at both ends. Other then that it brought a lot of joy to us. :D
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Wanted to re-read this novel since the movie is coming out and I read I a long time ago.  I still love this book.

0316286443|5.0|I gave it 5 stars because I'm a sucker for pretty pictures and cosmetics in general. I found nothing truly interesting about the book at all. Truthfully I've learned more from watching YouTube vids...but there are some pretty pics :)

B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This is by fat the best book in the series! I couldn't put it down! Unlike most of the others this one isn't just focused on the romance.  We learn who the ghost is( which I already figured out). We see another side to Kaleb.  And I can't wait for the next book to see what happens with the Net!!!
0393088804|5.0|Stunning and powerful piece of work.  Graphic history and worth every penny---if you are at all interested in WWI or graphic novels, this is for you.

B00EFFVZIM|5.0|Word of Mouth is one of the best cd's I have heard in awhile. Their first cd was good,but this one is even better. Every song is worth listening to. The cd in whole is worth a five time spin. Get 'Wanted',spread the 'Word of Mouth'.UPDATE: as of Feb.2014 The Wanted have disbanded.
B00G32OMF8|1.0|Didn't like it nearly as well as the first two movies.  Bitter, angry, marriage-buster, etc.  It doesn't have stats that would support<br />their making it in a marriage.  Disappointing.

B00B5HQLMI|2.0|The story was juvenile. Except for the opening sequence, the action scenes didn't rise to Bond level. The villain looked and acted stupidly most of the time. No chemistry with the women. Even the song sucked. Glad I didn't see it in the theater!
B0013POLS8|5.0|I like Mariah Carey she's my favorite woman singer because she has a good voice and she's pretty.<br /><br />  I like the Blu-ray therefor I give five stars.

B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I like Justin Timberlake he's my favorite singer of Nsync because he has a good voice and he also a good actor in one of the movie.<br /><br />  I like the cd and I will recommend the to lots of people.  Therefor I give five stars.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|Better every single time I watch it.  A masterpiece.  The subtleties and precision in editing and crafting the multiple storylines is superb.
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|As an avid birder for 36 years, I and my whole family can relate to everything in this movie! And, the birds were pretty accurate as species in the proper habitats. There was a couple birds/locations that were &#34;off&#34; but you could tell some homework was done before writing this movie!
B002VECLVY|5.0|A great movie reflecting the attitudes of the not-so-good old days when a man can't even attend the funeral of his long term intimate partner!  The acting and art direction was superb.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|If you like Hard Rock or, Metal you will like this. Excellent driving music, And just over all great. for listening.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Gone Girl was an interesting read. The story line was interesting at first, but then became predictable. I also felt uncomfortable reading through a lot of  bad language-which I felt was unnecessary. I will not be reading another Gillian Flynn book.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|The story is slowly plotted and the characters are not compelling.  I'm not done yet, but am finding excuses to read other books in the meantime....
B00571F26Y|2.0|I basically agree with Chris Masterjohn's review of this book: [...] Dr. Davis has many good points regarding the detrimental effects of modern grains on human health. But then he goes on to promote a grain free diet for everyone, failing to recognize that many cultures have thrived on grains by using proper preparation techniques, and failing to point out that many people do not suffer from the detrimental effects of gluten. He also promotes a low carbohydrate diet, which is fine for people who wish to lose weight but isn't sustainable for a lot of others, especially people who have or may develop thyroid issues because of it. Starches, particularly resistant starches from roots and tubers, have been a very important part of the human diet for millennia. I think the answer to our modern diet woes lies somewhere in between the SAD (Standard American Diet) and the very low carb, grain free diet proposed by Dr. Davis: moving away from modern wheat; reviving ancient grains (for those who can tolerate them) along with their traditional preparation techniques like soaking, sprouting, and souring; moving away from the modern potato and relying on a more diverse array of nutritious starches such as purple and red potatoes, cassava, yams, and sweet potatoes; and focusing the majority of our nutrition on fresh vegetables (of all the colors of the rainbow), with a small handful of quality meats and animal fats.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|great book.  I do not usually get ebooks, but now that I have the tools  to read ebooks, it's great.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game is the best game I have found on the kindle app store and it is extremely addictive it's totally worth the money and the wait for download
B000UZNRS2|4.0|The Stone Cold ( Camel Club ). Is a action filled thriller from beginning to end. David Baldacci sure<br />knows how to use a large number of characters to make a story that is an excellent read.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|if you like detective games and searching for clues and doing puzzles this is a good game for you. not a super hard game but keeps you occupied for a good while.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Truly laughed out loud all the way through this one. Somehow makes incapacitating social anxiety disorder seem fun. I will now have to follow Allie's blog.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This was an incredible book.  Reading it was an awesome experience. I found myself unable to put it down. Spellbinding.
0061726834|4.0|Loved this book. It really gets you thinking and it's easy to read. It's a bit slow in he beginning, but picks up towards the end.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. It is very hard to put this book down once started.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive game. Lots of fun. Higher levels are harder. Would be good to have a help screen detailing how it all works. Mostly learn by doing but still mindless fun
B008JFUPK8|3.0|When I was a kid I was a comic book store and asked the clerk what the DC in DC comics stood for, he smirked and said &#34;Dumb Comics&#34;. At the time I thought he was a jerk but in the long run it has proven to be true. Here is another example of the moo moos over WB don't understand the characters. Amy Adams as Lois Lane? NOPE, horrible. It takes more than good acting, you have to look the part, they didn't even bother to dye her hair. When Tom Hiddleston read for the part of THOR they thought he was brilliant but he did not look the part so they did not cast him as THOR, instead he got the role of LOKI.<br />The story? too much in one movie. They should learn from MARVEL and do long story arcs over several movies. The only thing DC has going for them is Batman. Everything else including Man of Steel is a disaster. Give me the Richard Donner/Christopher Reeve version any day.
B00486070K|5.0|Had to buy an apple adapter for the new 10.9 update. I wouldn't want to buy it if I did not have to but it works.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I love this game. Still trying to unlock all the bacteria DNA modifiers. Not an easy game to beat. Love how you have to think everytime. Only very small complaint is there are not enough spaces to name your plague. I am running out of ideas.<br /><br />Overall an exceptional game, if a bit morbid.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|this is a really fun game I love playing it. if you like shooter games you will like this game to.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|good info. Some of the suggestions are hard to find ie 1000 mg dha non fish oil .Not sure all points are fool proof but well put together in general. Fairly drastic to limit fruit have not seen that before. Diet books are hard to  understand as many have different takes.
1619692368|3.0|I bought this to pass the time on a long car trip.  I was surprised that there were only 4 CDs.  I figured it would be longer.  Ellen is a funny lady, but this book was too silly to be funny.  I chuckled at some things but mostly just thought, &#34;how does she come up with this stuff?&#34;
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app is the best alarm app out there. I am for sure getting the full version soon. I love it!
1446249182|5.0|Excellent!  Not only is this the first book that I go to when I have questions regarding SPSS, this is also my go to source for any question on statistics.  Really, really useful book.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Much like the previous two books, but with an unnecessary and shocking twist death of a major character at the end.
B007IHH3L2|5.0|Bowie digested everything.......As with this one, Lou Reed, and the BIG failure being Mott the Hoople....after Ian Hunter used the &#34;DUDES&#34; song to to start a career that never really happened. Tin Machine was the most  palatable of the of the post 80's Bowie and still is! To the closing. Hunter once said &#34; Iggy Pop has no talent, He will never make it&#34; Where is IAN now? THANX RONNO....
B0029LHW4U|4.0|Okay, so Layne's dead? Alas, as always, people seem to be more obessed with death rather than music and art.<br />Many tend to prefer putting an emphasis on that, rather than judging something on the merits of what the current day has to offer.<br />To me, the tragic story of Alice in Chains seems like an American 90's grunge version of what, for instance, Joy Division was in the late 70's. Both exquisite bands, tormented by life in all its unfairness. Band had success with moody songs, singer died, remaining members continued anyway, despite the ghost of the former singer overshadowing all efforts.<br /><br />What I'd like to say regarding this album is that it manages to convey a mood that is just as valid as anything that Alice in Chains did until 1995, only with its feet firmly planted in a time when grunge as a phenomenon has become nostalgia. Nevertheless, &#34;Black Gives To Blue&#34; is the other end of the bridge that had Alice In Chains' eponymous 1995 on the opposite end, and Jerry Cantrell's impressive &#34;Degradation Trip&#34; double album right in the middle. In a way the album's title is a possible impossibility. As much as black can't possibly give way to any colour, as much it proves that it is possible to have a cool AIC album without Staley. People tend to forget that a great song, a great melody can still exist without the voice of a once unique singer. All singers die, but good songs will survive.<br /><br />I for one quite like the voice of Jerry Cantrell, and I'm sorry to say that I don't miss Staley that much. He contributed to an<br />episode of the band that lasted for only 5 years (1990-1995) and here we are now with a great album without him. William Duvall, the new face, does a few great energetic guest spots (&#34;Last Of My Kind&#34; and &#34;Private Hell&#34;), while Cantrell immerses himself in his beloved (traditional?) double tracked vocals.<br />To me, it's basically a musical continuation of &#34;Degradation Trip&#34; as it hasmore similarities with that project than with 90's AIC. I don't mind about that very much, as I live now, and I like this album, despite how things used to be in a different time.
4789004546|5.0|Splendid book. Stop reading and just buy it. One of the most helpful resources I ever had when studying Japanese.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief is a simple book that holds onto you long after you have finished it.  The narrator is death.  When you think of death as the narrator there is a tendency to think of gloom.  In many ways Nazi Germany is gloom but the protagonist, Liesel, gives you hope for a world that can be better.  Liesel  who reminds you of the travails of Jonah impresses you with her ability to survive.
B00338QENI|5.0|Genius! This amazing true story reads like part science fiction, part genealogy research, part faith-healing, part Americana, part racial justice, and part medical miracle! Skloot has woven together the history of cell culture research with the life of the not far removed from slavery African-American woman who unwittingly donated her cervical cancer cells to what would become the first 'immortal line' of reproducing cells. Her cells have been “in space, blown up in an atom bomb, and used to cure polio.” Skloot's treatment of the history of medical research, and in particular the way the Lacks family has been treated subsequently is honest and harsh. Her treatment of the Lacks family is caring and thoughtful.  Highly recommend!
B0065CCT6U|5.0|If you are a fan of Cornell or Soundgarden you will like this CD.  I was lucky enough to see him on the songbook tour a couple of years ago, and this CD helped bring back that amazing show for me.  The acoustic version of Fell On Black Days brings a whole new demintion to that song that made me love it all over again.  The playlist is a mix of Temple of the Dog, Soundgarden, Audioslave and Cornell solo stuff.  I haven't been as crazy for his latest material, but he brings the best of it with the voice that could be the best in rock music ever.  The only issue I have is that this CD didn't have all the songs I saw him play on the songbook tour.
B000067CIJ|5.0|Remember hearing them in Europe a long time ago.  Still enjoy their hit songs in clean stereo. You will enjoy.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm in love with this book I can't wait till I started the second book then the third one. This is a love story under it all.
B0084TWN9K|3.0|Short stories are very open-ended.  Not to my fancy, really.  Guess I like ends tied up in a nice bow.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Cheap construction you have to fiddle with it a pot to get it to charge at all, I guess you get what you pay for<br /><br />*revision* 11/28/2013. Anker contacted me and replaced the part.... See comment below.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|I got this movie for my 6 year old niece and she loved it! I have seen the movie as well and I also really like it. Her favorite song from the movie is &#34;Crusin' for a Brusin'&#34;. I also love that song.

B00867GJYK|5.0|This is great movie!  Watch it.  Ellen DeGenerris (spelling?) is outstanding.  Watch it and your heart will beat as loudly for fins and scales as it does for your furry best friends.
B00979CS50|4.0|A rollicking guitar fest!<br /><br />Apparently I need to add some more words.  People would write more reviews without these stupid rules!
B001KX50BK|5.0|A classic.  Totally unrealistic.  But you have to love it anyway.  Romance, comedy, great clothes, Julia Roberts and Richard Gere.  A winner.
B007N8RULO|4.0|It is one of the few computer games that I play.  I'm having a bit of trouble playing it on my Kindle as it doesn't want to move exactly where I want it to go but goes to a different spot.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|i love this game ,i like it better than candy crush! its great ! love the challenge! I play it everyday.
B001QWBM62|4.0|I liked this recorder, but ended up returning it for the Tascam DR-100 because it has 2 outputs. 1 for the headphones and another for the camera (at a lower volume). I believe this is a great product, but for the same price, I like the Tascam better.
B00DJ4PIBK|5.0|Our kids love these during the holiday season. This our 4th year ordering! We recommend this to all LEGO builders.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game! Have completed all available levels waiting on more episodes to be added! Be careful. ...highly addictive. I couldn't stop playing.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I appreciate being able to find these batteries from the comfort of my home and not have to shop from place to place. There are for my digital scale. With the name and model number you can almost find anything. My scale is up and running great!
0143113100|4.0|My husband had a stroke a year ago and couldn't play the drums anymore as his left side was slow. He'd get depressed and felt he'd never be the same but I kept telling him the brain can 're-program' itself, he just has to keep re-learning what he knows. He didn't seem to believe me so I looked on here for a book that might support this, and found this one. He hasn't put it down since it came and is very encouraged, now telling ME that he can get better and why lol. He said it gets a bit technical for him at times but it's given him the information he needed to encourage him to get well and that's enough for me.
0670022411|5.0|Yummy! Historical fiction with Withches, Vampires and Daemons, oh my! There is great sexual tension between the main characters. Harkness nails the mystery and keeps you turning pages.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|First time grandmother cannot give grandson anything but the best....and this is it.  He and his mom LOVE the Wubbanub because not only is it a quality pacifier, but Mr. Giraffe and Mr. Monkey keep it within easy reach of baby.

B008TMA1LY|5.0|I love hello Kitty cafe! My sister loves this game. I have not played this game yet.When I bought. this game I was soooooo excited!
B00G32OER4|5.0|It was the scariest movie I've seen in a long time. Kept me on the edge of my seat through out the movie
B009ME47H2|5.0|I use this app on my kindle fire hd and it works great! There is no problem with the sound quality or volume when I play it back. Today, I recorded a song being played in science class and the kid who was attempting to sing along with it. When I played it back, it sounded great and I could clearly hear the horrible special guest in the background. I also used it in Latin for a grammar speech my teacher gave. This app works great and I will be using it often.
0345803485|5.0|This book is great but make sure you read past the first 1/2 as it gets better.  Too much sex in the first part of book for me, and I am glad I kept at it.
B004K58GSO|5.0|One of my favorite movies done by John Wayne even if he did not get any awards for this movie.
B00005MK9Y|5.0|It was absolutely what I expected! I will be doing business with them again real soon!! Great product! Great Price! It was absolutely what I expected! Will do business again!

B0063IH60K|4.0|Title says it all. Have not used any other kindle solitaire apps so nothing to compare to.  Good enough for passing a quick ten minutes, easy to use layout with about one annoying ad per game if you're online.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This tale grips you instantly and takes you around the world learning how differing peoples handle crisis.  Truly insightful with respect to our world's future.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Awesome drama horror thriller series.  I look forward to each week's episode.  My husband & I will make it a date night & just watch The Walking Dead in hopes that someone important will die so we can get all sad & mad at the show.  But that's how it goes in the world of the undead.  One day you're here & then you're gone.
B0040I09RM|4.0|First, the superficial. Charlie Hunnam is nice looking. Second, the storylines are well written, and just when I think I know how it's going down, a new twist turns things upside down. I'm on the 5th season right now, and watching the show is like reading a really good book.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|this book really stunned me by how much it sucked ass. it looked like one of those horrible pornos on pornhub.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very entertaining. Graphics were great. Play time was not very long. I would recommend this game to my friends everywhere. Fun fun fun.
B00G722T22|3.0|I would like to give the album more stars, but I really can`t.<br />This album has some AMAZING songs, which is a good follow-up to Goodbye Lullaby. Songs such as Rock N` Roll, Here`s To Never Growing Up, and B**chin` Summer are all awesome tracks. HOWEVER: the only song on this album that I really (really really really)... disliked was Hello Kitty. Sorry to Avril fans, but I just couldn`t see the point in the song, even though I listened to it over twenty times. Bad Girl (featuring Manson) was an okay song; I mean Avril is a really good singer, but I am not really a fan of Marilyn Manson (please continue reading... I am allowed my own opinion) I do not support his Satanic stage acts, ripping of the Bible, or the shocking stuff he does.<br />ANYWAY... the song isn`t the worst song Avril Lavigne has ever recorded, but I have to tell you, it brings the album down QUITE a bit. I decided after I heard it I wasn`t a fan.<br /><br />HOWEVER, this is the new word from Avril Lavigne, and I must say that for the most part, it`s a pleasant one.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use. Works well with no Internet. I recommend for everyone. Sends fun messages.  Easy to see key board<br />.
B000R4SMCW|4.0|Weird thing about this movie is I went into thinking i would not enjoy it,but to my surprise it was very well done and entertaining. I highly recommend.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|This was bought as a gift for my wife.  She found it much better than the movie. A must read.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I could not put this book down!!! It's such an amazing story, so heartfelt, warm and sad all at the Same time!!! A must read.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We so enjoy the interesting characters and the twists and turns of the story line.  We look forward to the next season to see where it will take us
B00992CF6W|4.0|Really cool, but I would let people have more space on the seeds . Also I would give it more supplies on creative.<br />Over all its awesome
B006VREHRS|4.0|Steve Buscemi at his best, an actor that has earned his empire....An actor and his empire, plus sex and violence.......like turkey and gravy
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The first two books only took me a week to read. They moved along and held my attention. This last book took me a month to finish. Just to long.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|A must have in everyone's library.  Beautiful life philosophy. Thank you Morrie for passing through our planet.  I wish I would have known you.
0767919408|5.0|Bill Bryson is just a great author -- no matter what he writes.  Fascinating stories in this book.  Keep 'em coming!
0679405631|5.0|Wonderful book! Once you pass the first 20 pages, which describe the setting, the book is amazing. I had a hard time putting the book down.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|All time family favorite all year around. So happy to finally own it and watch without commercial! Definitely recommend to everyone
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I have the eleventh doctors sonic and I have to say the tenth doctors sonic feels much more stable, easy to handle and the pen is a huge plus. So when you're not pretending to be the doctor you have a practical college or school application for it.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Captured my imagination and attention from the beginning to the end. Vivid imagery, you will not be disappointed! I loved it!
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|This game is one of the best. Not too easy like some and kept my interest the entire game!! Would highly recommend.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|I did not expect this movie to be as good as it is.  Absolutely fantastic.  Really looking forward to the next in the series.
B0072HXVRS|4.0|In case anyone was wondering what exactly an &#34;Asian Magical Being&#34; is, I highly suspect that the myth they were aiming for was a Kirin,) (or Qilin,) known in Chinese, Korean and Japanese mythology and often referred to as &#34;The Chinese Unicorn&#34;.<br /><br /> Legend has it that they appear only before those destined to become great kings and leaders of men, and many emperors have alleged to have seen it in order to strengthen their claim to ruling by Divine Right. Usually they are described as being a cross between a chinese dragon, a deer, and a little bit of horse thrown in for good measure.
1451666179|5.0|I love this.  I love the website and I love this book. Literally the only negative thing I could say about this book is that it doesn't include THE YEAR KENNY LOGGINS RUINED CHRISTMAS (which might be the funniest thing I've ever read), and that technology has not made it possible to stream the goose video in a paperback book.<br /><br />If you have never read any of these things, I suggest the brilliant website (because you can get your fix immediately) and then picking up the book which includes brand new \\"has me crying laughing\\" stories.  (The Parrot.  I'm just saying.)<br /><br />Allie, if you're reading this (and if you're anything like me, you reading every single review of your product available), congrats.  It's amazing.  I'm looking forward to the second one!!  Please pet the Helper and the Simple for me.<br /><br />-review protected by Invisible Copyright Monster.
0563486430|5.0|I like this book a little better than the Feast of the Drowned, but still overall it's a good representation of the series and of the characters.  I will be ordering more books to read for sure.
B0031TZ8TU|3.0|I usually love Ken Follett so I thought I would read this true story. Follett made it very interesting to read but I like his fiction books better.
B004M3GDI4|4.0|Very high powered headlamp. A bit heavy, but well worth it. 3 light modes help save battery and provide plenty of Candle Power.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was one of the best books I've read this year - and I read about a book a day.
B0081J9OWC|1.0|Man on Fire: One good song, one star. The rest are excessively cheesy. Too bad, as I liked their earlier stuff.
B00AZ3KPZC|5.0|Very Nostalgic, I watched this movie as a child and I wanted to share it with my son.  Its funny how the quality has improved so much in the last 20 years.
0143038583|3.0|I purchased it to familarize myself with students I met with to discuse current nutritional issues. They were reading this with many questions as to their personal lives.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Beautifully written. Wisdom spoken from the heart. Recommended for everyone seeking to know more about their spiritual journey and awakening
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|WOW! Brandon Sanderson does it again. This is an exciting world with lots of amazing ideas to digest. Sanderson's writing is excellent. You are totally involved in this strange new America he creates. I can't wait to read the next in the series.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Very funny, quotable, instant classic with great music. Rebel Wilson kills it, who knew Anna Kendricks could sing, and the Asian girl is bats**t crazy. What's not to love?
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|Surprisingly, I really like this album! I agree with other reviews about the song Bangerz. I pass that one out every time...That's how much I dislike it. Not crazy bout &#34;Love Money Party&#34; either, but all others are good. I'm not really a fan of Mileys, but I have to say, this is a good album. She has a unique sound to her voice that I like. I thought this would be one of those albums that you only like 2-3 songs. Turns out, I only dislike 2 songs and that makes me happy because 2 out of 13 is pretty good odds.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|All my friends seemed to be playing so I thought... what the heck I'll try it, turns out it lots of fun!
0875428940|5.0|I love the art on these cards. Prefect for a Wiccan. These cards really speak to me. I find that personaly its not always easy to shuffle a tarot deck but thats just because i have small hands! Over all Art work is personal and if you like Nature and or ar Wiccan you will love this deck :)
B00DVKOYBM|4.0|Played 1 game so far amd it seems like a game for me n my style. Hope to get little more time to check all features.
B00FAVRHBE|5.0|Even though Christopher Eccleston did not want to be in the episode, it's great to have David Tennant and Billie Piper back for this special.
B0080MPUUK|4.0|Early Woody Allen but typical for him. Still enjoyed the concept and thought it was both amusing and funny. Kind of cute too.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|It works reley well ,  I download all the time. there's not much wrong with it and that's a good thing I use it often the upgrades for good too and are going to prove minutes. I hope you keep that way.
145210655X|2.0|I don't think it is worth the price. Not many pages, not very funny to me, but my 8 year old read it 5 times.  He would probably give it 5 stars.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is soooooooooo fun and exciting!!!!!!!!!!! I hope you guys love it as much as I did!!!!!#
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Greatest of the new era Superman movies. My only complaint about the movie is that some of the fight scenes in toward the end could be a little shorter.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's exciting and fun to play when you want to entertain yourself. Great game for adults.. you will enjoy it anytime and anywhere. It can be addictive.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I am huge Star Wars Fan. I had held out buying the complete saga for a while but I finally pulled the trigger. Its nice for the collectioin.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I really loved & thought Insurgent was awesome. I was so looking forward to this book. I was so disappointed.
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|I haven't watched the special features yet, but the extended edition is THE version of this movie to watch. The extra bits range from incredibly important plot enhancers to just fun additions. I was a little hesitant at first because I honestly thought it was a bit too long in theaters. But I will now be selling my theatrical version. MINOR SPOILERS: There was one extended bit that was embarrassing to watch, kind of like how Phantom Menace is awesome, but the Jar-Jar parts are embarrassing to watch, especially if someone comes in on that part, and you basically have to defend yourself for liking some serious cheese. I digress, the troll king guy sings... and while being very Tolkieny, it is... uncomfortable to watch... kind of like if your grandma put her hand way too high on your leg and just left it there for far too long. Also, as far as extended content goes, there is more violence, notably a few more decapitations and the &#34;fleeting nudity&#34; mentioned on the back of the box (It's there, look at the back cover, you'll see it) was just the dwarves playing in a fountain from a distance. It was funny and harmless, but something to keep in mind if you don't want younger viewers to see cg dwarf butt.
B000001FDK|5.0|Well worth it for the memories.  Great sounding, appears they updated the instrumental parts but sounds like original vocals.  Nothing cut-out as often found in remastering.  Just as perfect as I remember it.  Wow what a great piece of work.<br />Amazon ripped it to my cloud storage plus I had the CD in my mail box the next day.  I had to go 5 star it was just all so easy and the  sound was so so clean; high quality.  Can't go wrong if this is your style.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I like the book so much better than the movie. They have to cut out so much to make the movie the allotted time that it takes away from the story. So if u like the movie u will certainly like the book.
B00DXPC1U6|1.0|I'm a long time fan of Dexter. Started watching it when it first came on and loved every bit of it...until I saw Season 8. Absolutely some of the worst writing, acting, and ending I've ever seen. I bought every other season of Dexter on Blu-ray but I will NOT be buying this one. I'll just pretend Season 7 was the finale. As a true Dexter fan, I mean, hardcore fan, the flaws of Season 8 we're obvious with the start of the second episode.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Excellent!  Big enough screen for even my old eyes, and easy to operate, just like the old push-button tyes I remember from my days as and accountant.
B00CUIVGZS|4.0|A master at his craft. The band makes the music speak to you. Chick Corea is constantly creating with different instruments and band members.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|I take it this is a re-make of the &#34;Wrath of Kahn?&#34;  I liked it much more than the original.  Wow!  The interior of the Enterprize is stunning and quite believable.  It really looks like a starship inside, not a fancy hotel lobby like Enterprize in TNG.  The warp engines and warp core area were especially impressive.  The engine(s) reminded me of the huge magnets and power generators for the European accelerator (the latest).  Great use of current technology to represent something in the future.  Kepp it up, fellas!  The plot line was solid and the action never quits.  Some surprises, but none that were too unbelievable.  And I really loved the Klingons.  They looked more like intelligent humanoids, and not a bunch of shaggy cave men in Roman armor.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Definitely not as strong as the first two, with an unnecessarily disappointing ending. A major style shift from the first two as well, which seemed out of place.
B003D0E3FM|5.0|Still a great classic with a novel theme &#34;Monsters from the Id&#34;.  First saw this as a young boy of eight, and then several times throughout my life.  For its time, it was an outstanding film, and still merits my praise even if the equipment is rather outdated and clunky looking when compared to the new Star Trek movies, etc.  We've moved on, but this movie pays wonderful tribute to the science of it's day!
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|this book was amazing! i loved it, i recommend them so much! and i love the movie equally. i am sure you will enjoy it!
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I really enjoy Sanderson's writing, and Steelheart is no different. I love the setting, I love the characters, I think its great how Sanderson was able to capture the essence of old comic book stories and implement it in a new environment. Some of the stuff was a little corny, but it didn't bother me. I smiled while I was reading this book, so that is a good sign.
B00007LTIL|4.0|I loved this, Working Man's Dead and Live Dead (the first Dead that I heard in the 60s). I think these three albums really hold up, but I think Jerry Garcia, dare I commit this sacrilege, is likely the most overrated guitarist ever. For those who idolize him, I'm pretty sure they are more caught up in the culture of the Dead rather than his actual talent.<br />Just compare him to his rock and roll guitar playing peers, Hendrix, Beck, Clapton, etc. and the music speak for itself.
B00FEN1C50|5.0|Best movie ever. Giant robots punching giant monsters in the face. This just appeals to every single part of me. Cant praise it highly enough.
B000005RU2|4.0|Growing up on Deep Purple in the 70's, this album was a thrill ride that I thought came only second to Deep Purple In Rock. It holds up very well, especially Blackmore and Paice.
0805086846|5.0|Fascinating book. All it takes is greed and ignorance for evil people to get their way and destroy a nation of people.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|The movie was fine.  I'm not giving anything more than 3 stars until I can watch HD through my computer (HTPC).
B000XUBFE2|4.0|“The Book Thief” is both the title of the book and the name given to Leisel, a young girl growing up in Germany during World War II.  In an interesting twist, the narrator to the story is Death, and Death constantly throws in little tidbits about Leisel, observations on humans, and Death has a fascination with colors when people die.  These colors provide a distraction for Death, but it really didn’t do much for me throughout the story as I wasn’t sure if the colors were supposed to represent something symbolic or just an observation at the time Death shows up to claim a soul.  I enjoyed Death as the narrator, but at times he/she/it revealed parts of the story that would happen months or years in advance, and I found that a little annoying at times.<br /><br />Colors as well as the stories of humans fascinate the narrator, and Death chooses to reveal Leisel’s story from around age 10 to 14.  The reader gets a look into the tragedies of war, the senseless mistreatment of Jews, love of family, love of friends, and the human struggle to find joy during hard times.  Despite Death being the narrator, and dealing with the dark side of war, there were some rays of sunshine that broke through in this story.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the book and especially Death’s observations on war and the job of retrieving souls.  It is sad what humans do to each other, but also encouraging what a few small acts of kindness can do.  It was also interesting to look at the power of words to both kill and to heal.
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|Rarely is a film so annoying I can't get through an hour of it.  This combines grungy artificial CGI colors and textures, shaky cam fast edits, and exaggerated hammy acting.  At the end of the day, is it more than \\"Transformers\\" with some feisty soldiers inside?  The way they control the robots looks ridiculous.  The scientists are irritating.  The soldiers are cardboard cutouts impossible to care about.  The monsters are basically godzillas.  A cartoon could have done it all in a much more visually appealing way for about 5% of the cost.
B00FHATBGW|1.0|On the Amazon kindle fire hd it won't let m ess open the app at all. It just goes to a.blank grey page. Game sounds fun. Wish I could have played.
0156030306|3.0|The book starts with a good idea but the story is spread thin. The reader knows where the book is headed and the journey there is quite boring. Definitely not a science fiction classic. Could have been a decent short story though.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I have been waiting on this game to come to mobile/Kindle Fire HD for SO LONG!!<br />It is my favorite game on Facebook, and to be able to play it on my handheld devices is SO AWESOME!<br />Everyone must download this game. You'll never put it Down, lol.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love the challenge of matching up squares.....timed and just getting matches.  Great game with the various possible match games.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I think it's an awesome game. I love a great challenge.  It gives me something to do in my spare time. I would recommend this game to my friends.
140006922X|5.0|Beautifully and insightfully written!  Couldn't put it down.  Asian simply relates the evidence to the reader without judgement/  I know I will read this book many times because it is both compelling and scholarly.  Thanks.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|Trying to find Candy Crush for my Kindle --- this was not a satisfying alternative.  Played it a couple times and quickly got bored.
B002KJX4IE|4.0|Funny, funky, and scary, all at the same time.  The Calypso dancing dinner scene is as funny today as it was when the movie was new.  Gets a little silly sometimes but still keeps you laughing.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I am not very good at it but have fun playing!  I may never get past level 40 but enjoy it anyway!!  Kids like it too!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is probably Grisham's best-written book.  The scene in Jake's office where the father of the dead boys forgives their killer stunned me.  I think this book has Oscar movie written all over it.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Fun, but a bit addictive. All of a sudden an hour has flown by. I still haven't figuref out how you play it with other people.
0066214122|3.0|This book is okay, but it is not what I would consider one of CR's best. Didn't like the end.
B00ATSBIIG|4.0|This game is fun, however the free online version offers more levels than this one.  Still an enjoyable game that passes the time.  If you like puzzles you'll like this game.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Holmes is the ultimate, a detective with incredible insight and yet surprising foibles.  Always good reading but hard to put down.
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|I Love It.  I wish she hadn't made us wait so many years for new material but I'm GLAD it is finally here!
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|This figure is requisite~ An absolute must have, cannot pass up, for any Sailor Moon fan or avid collector. The first edition with the extra faces adds to help really capture Sailor Moons classic overly emotional, yet stead fast heroics that anyone who's familiar with the character will love. I absolutely adore her. And she is a great kick off to start of this line of figures.
B00AYBU7TE|5.0|Excellent versions of classic songs. The raw emotion on Hurt makes it such a powerful song. Even Trent Reznor was amazed and awed by Cash's version.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Wonderful product. Absolutely love it ! I use this with my Samsung 40\\" LCD TV and it works like a charm.<br /><br />I was easily able to set it up using Chromecast's iphone app (I'm sure the Android counterpart would have been equally successful). Once the connection was setup, all my other devices (both wireless AND wired) were able to detect chromecast through the google-cast extension for chrome.<br /><br />Some useful info -<br /><br />1) Router settings may need to be adjusted in order for chromecast to work. These might be useful links to address router issues: [...] and [...]<br /><br />2) While setting up my Macbook to cast chrome-tabs, I had to adjust Firewall settings to allow it to interact with the Chromecast. I basically followed some steps outlined here: [...] . I had to ensure I wasn't on a VPN network as well.<br /><br />And once set up, I was basically able to connect/cast from all my devices. Quality of the cast depends, as has been mentioned in several places, on the network basically...a faster wifi network will ensure a good quality cast.
B007FH9GA6|1.0|I really like the movie but the disk sent to me was a copy and of very poor quality, 2 weeks  to receive
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|It is very portable.  It has one USB port and an additional built-in cable with micro USB tip to charge your electronic gear.  Easy to carry while charging a phone (one phone at a time, of course).  It has everything going for it until I upgraded my iPhone 5 to 7.0.3.  I have always used the built-in charging cable of the battery with an Apple micro USB to Lightning adapter when charging my iPhone 5.  It charged flawlessly.  I put this in the past tense because after I upgraded the 5 to 7.0.3, the battery now does not charge the phone.  The battery can still charge the phone using the other USB port.  But that is not the point.  Both options should work.<br /><br />Now, I also happen to have an iPhone 5S from work.  It arrived a week ago with 7.0.2.  The Anker battery charged the 5S with the built-in cable and micro USB to lightning adapter.  No issue at all with charging.  Does it right away.  Until I also upgraded the 5S to 7.0.3.  The Anker battery has stopped charging the 5S as well (right after the upgrade).<br /><br />As a last test, I borrowed a work colleague's iPhone 5 that was still on 6.1.3 firmware.  Using the same built-in cable to lightning adapter combination, the Anker battery immediately started charging his iPhone.<br /><br />Anker support has been very responsive.  They have suggested a few things that I actually have already done beforehand.  The last input they had was that the lightning adapter was faulty.  Nope.  As stated above, it successfully charged an iPhone with 6.1.3 firmware.  Furthermore, I still use the lightning adapter to snap onto a micro usb wall charger to charge both my iPhones 5 and 5S when the original chargers are not readily available.<br /><br />I thought I covered all the troubleshooting steps and combinations that I have available.  Has anyone else who bought the Slim3 have a similar set up as mine and also experienced the same result?<br /><br />***UPDATE December 2, 2013<br />This company now gets 5 stars from me justfor the sheer responsiveness of their customer service.  They care about their products and they care about their customers.  Communication was immediate.  Best that I have encountered in all of my company dealings (I manage an IT department).  I had issues with the built-in cable of my Slim 3.  Anker tried to assist and in the end gave me the option to return or exchange the item.  Since I like the product line, I chose to do the exchange and with a different battery model.  I received a brand new Anker Astro 2 within a week, and I must say I am happy to be able to use both USB ports for my iPhones (with lightning adapter) again. Yes, I am one very satisfied customer.  My personal experience with this company is topnotch, and no, they are not paying me to write this. I will be looking at Anker for future battery backup and replacement needs.
B008MIMWOO|5.0|Grew up watching the movies and TV shows this trio of films spoofs, satirizes, pokes fun at and generally enjoys mocking while at the same time they revere, honor and pay homage to them.  Absolute classics.  Individually all three are Masterpieces and together they make a priceless addition to your collection.  (At least they are if you are like me and they strike a perfect cord with your childhood and youth.)<br /><br />The packaging is Spartan.  One slim jewel case, no insert, no bells and whistles.  The three disks have the usual features and bonus materials available.  The Blu-Ray format doesn't do much for the movies as they are not high impact experiences dependent on big FX splashes across the screen, but it doesn't hurt either.
B003XT60KO|5.0|An absolutely awesome unmasking of the most typical lies used by the interventionists/socialists/social-democrats to lay their hands on people's lives, interactions and money. Very easy to read and follow, whets your appetite for more free-market economics and Austrian economics in particular.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This TV show is very intriguing and full of suspense! You just never know what is going to happen next.
B00G32TD98|5.0|Very spookie without all the slice and dice stuff.  Was the story and the way the mood was set that was so scary.  I always wondered if the story had any truth in it?
0446530573|5.0|I enjoy cooking for my family, I've used this book 3 or 4 times and every meal has been a hit. I'd recommend if you love Italian food.
B00DBO1YMK|5.0|I received this for my birthday in mid-October and have been listening to it every day since - and I don't believe in listening to Christmas music until after Thanksgiving!  It is spectacular!  All of us, from the youngest at age 2 to my husband and I, love Piano Guys.  My four year old watches them on youtube and tells me he is going to play the cello one day.<br /><br />I am ordering a stack of them tonight to use as thank you and teacher gifts.
B0036OP0QQ|5.0|This Cd is truly a gem for any Whitney fan, I ordered it and was surprised at the content when it came, It has all of her finest songs in their orginal cd casings, I am playing this cd right now and I am truly enjoying it. I am so sorry that we lost her at such a early age, but her music will live on. Rest in Peace Queen Whitney
B009GEYX5E|1.0|It was defective and didnt work in my 600 camera.  This may be due to my old 600 polaroid camera...
0802473156|5.0|This book should be read by anyone entering a commited relationship.  It could save many marriages!  I gave these to some of my married/engaged family and friends.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Awesome knife and everything that I acspected in the knife. The sheath is okay but I can work with it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I got this yesterday and i have been beyond pleased thus far. I've used my chromebook thus far and the set up was flawless. The only issue i'm having is that I need to get an HDMI selector, since I have only one HDMI port in my TV and I have 2 HDMI cables (including the google chromecast) that I need to run. Netflix and youtube streamed without a glitch, however when I attempted to open up my amazon prime instant video, it was skipping on the TV as I streamed it. However I do not believe this is a chromecast problem, but I only have a N150 dual band router and I was trying to use chromecast (which uses wifi) and my chromebook at the same time, which my router doesn't do well. I am getting a new N600 router, so once that's installed i'm sure i won't have any issues with instant video. you really can't beat the price of $35 for online streaming, at least a novice tech geek like me hasn't found.
B001IYCMNA|2.0|Worked wonderfully for a year. As unlikely as it seems all access points began to display erratic behavior this past week.<br /><br />Naturally I thought to myself, 'There is statically no chance that these APs all have failures at the same time without some external factor at play..' So I tore my infrastructure apart until I had narrowed the issue down to the 9 APs (WAP4410N).<br /><br />When attempting to connect to the AP the devices produce an error: 'Wireless Access Point unstable. Disabling Network.' (Samsung Devices). Power Cycling the 9 AP yielded no results. Upon further inspection of the APs, each of them had blinking power LED lights well after being power cycled.<br /><br />I google'd this issue and came upon a similar incident in which Cisco tech support recommended a Hard Factory Reset for the affected APs. So I performed a factory reset and reconfiguration on all of these APs... and it worked!<br /><br />...At least for a couple hours... then they all went back to being 'unstable' Some other devices were able to connect but either hung at trying to lease an IP address from the server or if they could get an IP the throughput was just crazy bad... Like below dial-up bad.<br /><br />I really cannot fathom how all of these APs suddenly have trouble since there have been no other wireless infrastructure added to my environment. Not even a microwave.<br /><br />Really disillusioned with this 'Cisco' AP at this point. Not sure that I'll purchase others at this price point.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|fun game easy to play for all ages cute and funny can be a little difficult at times but never dull worth the download
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Pros<br />+ As long you have faster connection over 6mb is nearly no lag<br />+ Fully mirror PC<br />+ Great youtube apps for phone (can search and pause)<br />+ Small and compact<br />+ Amazing price for what you getting<br />+ Have a lot of potential<br /><br />Cons<br />- Require a power adapter<br />- No MIrror support for Android<br />- No Chrome Browser support for Android<br />- Can't play own music or video from the phone.<br />- Lack of apps<br /><br />Overall I think is 3 1/2 stars but for the price is hard to beat so is worth of 4 stars, wish the android wasn't so limited. it got so much potential.
B000URWYTS|5.0|I felt as though the characters were here in real life because of the superb writing. I liked that the main character, Mamuth, spoke her mind even at the risk of losing the person she had given up so much for. I hated the end but history cannot be changed.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I bought this with apprehension.....how can you build on The Shining??? This was fantastic. The characters were real and believable.....<br />I grew up reading Stephen King.....still my favorite author of all time and once again he did not disappoint!!! Don't stop what you do....such a gift...a true \\"shining\\"!!!!
B003E74B24|5.0|This was a great quick read. It really shows the man the is Gordon Ramsey. If this man can't make you want to cook, than nobody can.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|As always, Khalid hosseini never disappoints. This may be his best work yet. His writing has this ability to transport you to the place, time, and the lives of the characters he creates. Such deeply interwoven, vividly imaginative writing. I loved all the characters in the book. Somewhere in the highs and lows of the lives of these characters, we can all find something that resonates and stays within us.
B00AG472DS|5.0|Best Thriller since Se7en! Fincher is a genius in this genre. The movie is very long but the attention to details is amazing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a really cool game. It makes you think and it is not to easy and not to hard. But I can not get past level 5. I wish I could so I would be able to go to the next level. But I still like to go back to the other levels.
B00D3LA71K|5.0|Independent American Cinema at it's best, if you haven't already go watch Shotgun Stories and Take Shelter. Both talks about very human stories, Mud is a great film from top to bottom
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I have used Evernote extensively and I have used Springpad extensively. I have read many reviews on both. Here is my conclusion. It is a matter of personal preference. I will say that more creative personalities will prefer Springpad. More business people will prefer Evernote.<br /><br />I will say this...For Kindle Fire Users...Evernote has proven to be more stable on the Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Since springpad is free, I will continue to use it for very specific applications, but Evernote is my primary app.
B00E89VXQY|5.0|This needs to be on 3D blu ray I hope soon then months later This only lasted in imax one week then they pulled it.....metallica try to release it before chirstmas that would be awesome!!!!!!
140006922X|5.0|Excellent book, especially for those like me who have little background information on that era. Absolutely no matter your beliefs this is worth the read.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|This book is truly amazing, a gift to all readers.  It is like nothing else I have ever read before and it grabbed me from the start and held my interest right until the end.  It covers so much, takes the reader to so many places and most importantly explores the complicated, yet needed relationships of family, loves and friendship.  I never thought I would be so fascinated about botany, in fact at first I thought the book would not be of any interest to me.  I could not have been more wrong and I'm so glad I read the reviews and gave this book a chance.  It is rare you find a book this special, that takes you on a journey all over the world, examines complicated, yet loving family bonds, is a love story and a main character who grows into herself, despite the inevitable stresses life throws at us.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is very fun and addictive. I've been playing it for months and I still love it. Every one should download this game.
B00005N7Z1|5.0|The rare combination of an action movie that has a great script, humor, and a message. Not to be confused with the sequels.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thanks for finally for this app just one thing having lots of trouble logging in to Facebook can't get online
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|It changed the way I think!! If you think you have ever done something wrong and believe you will not be forgiven no matter what you do, then definitely read this.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|At first I thought it was hooked, now I can't wait to get more men. Having lots of fun.  Thanks for imaginative new game.
B000002L7J|3.0|This is the Smiths album that is the hardest for me to wrap my head around, despite having purchased it almost 30 years ago.  I was a bit out of order in my acquisition of Smiths albums, beginning with the Self-Titled album, then picking up Louder than Bombs, then Meat is Murder, then the Queen is Dead, then Strangeways, then Rank.  So, I had already acquainted myself with the mellower sounds of the debut LP and the more (for lack of a better term) &#34;mainstream&#34; Louder than Bombs (and I know that isn't the right word, because the Smiths were never mainstream.  Am I thinking &#34;accessible&#34;?).<br /><br />In any event, I was unprepared for the harder sound of Meat is Murder and I don't think I've ever warmed up to it.  I enjoy &#34;The Headmaster Ritual&#34; and &#34;What She Said,&#34; and even the title track, but these other songs elude me for some reason.  So, while I recognize its contribution to music, my *opinion* (and that's all it is) is that this is my least favorite, and certainly not the first Smiths album I would share with the unenlightened.
0988262592|5.0|This book reflects the reality of every IT department and their wish to bring value to the business while  struggling with the massive work overload… I did suffer with Bill while reading and enjoyed the nostalgia of IT Operations and Testing Factories.
B000002L5P|5.0|I actually have a CD with Japanese writing and additional tracks, but I can't seem to find that on Amazon, so I'll talk about the tracks on this album here.  I recently read Morrissey's autobiography and was surprised to find that he was disappointed by the production of this album.  I actually like it.  I realize it doesn't have a hard edge to it, but that's a huge part of it's charm.  These songs are smooth as butter, making Morrissey's lyrics that much more surprising.  The Smiths are one of the very few bands of my youth that I still enjoy listening to as I am engulfed by middle-age, and this album is no exception.  It's not the most sophisticated album when it comes to production values and that may take a listen to get used to (especially in these days of drum machines and auto-tune), but it stands on its own merits surprisingly well after all these years.
B008AX1HD8|5.0|Its a great story and very true to the feel of Australia in which the story is set.  This surprises me as the author is Norwegian.  Well written.  Different.  Very entertaining.  Easy to see why his early books catapulted him to fame... and he continues with great reads.  Highly recommended.
B000002LCX|4.0|Strangeways is a strange album for me.  I love six of the songs on the album, and skip four of them.  So, why is it a 4 star album?  Because those six songs are THAT good!  And, frankly, it would be seven songs if &#34;Last Night I Dreamt Somebody Loved Me&#34; didn't have that pointless, never-ending intro.  As was the case with the Smiths, this album is great more often than not.  Besides, you might as well listen to &#34;Girlfriend in a Coma&#34; because that seems to be the Smiths/Morrissey song that every hipster likes to reference.
B00CEF014E|5.0|Solstice by Damian Stevenson is obviously written by a creative writing genius that's expert in manipulatively twisting and turning your thoughts, perceptions and feelings at his discretion. The masterful plot behind which Stevenson writes is nothing short of brilliant!<br />The main character Dana, a beautiful young woman with a history of drug abuse, depression and an official bipolar diagnosis, is described so vividly, so real, you can't help but root for her.<br />After a short bout in a mental institution for treatment of deep dark depression she supposedly sets out with her hunky boyfriend Dylan to set her up for a visit with her pretty sister Zoe. She lives with her new husband and unknown to Dana her cult-Iike extended family in a farm community isolated from society. Led by her handsomely evil husband Clive. That man of many faces. The guy you love to hate.<br />But is this all real? That's the million dollar question.<br />Apparently this &#34;organic tree hugging cult family&#34; he's created and rules traditionally sacrifices a virgin if there's a drought. Dana is a virgin, there's a drought and you can only imagine what happens next with this fast paced, sexy hot, edge of your seat, gory, adrenaline spiking, intense masterpiece timed repeatedly with continuous climax big and small.<br />Guaranteed start to finish you will be guessing wrong more than a dozen times! This talented author will play you like putty in his hands. If you're up for a challenge I double dog dare you to read this one and let Stevenson know what you think. I'll say it again-Brilliant!
B000002LBH|5.0|Growing up in the Bible Belt, I was only beginning to experience the Smiths when this compilation came out.  I enjoyed the debut album, so I thought I'd give it a go.  Ah, the days when I was able to make such impulse buys!<br /><br />I actually bought this on vinyl at first, and it kind of got in the way.  There would be sides I would listen to without bothering to turn the records over, so buying this in CD format helped me overcome my laziness and appreciate the collection as a whole.  As information travelled slowly in those days, I had no clue that this was a collection of previously-released singles.<br /><br />Sure, you'll find some songs are better than others.  I have my favorites, and you'll have yours.  The bottom line is that this is a great collection from a very prolific band and there is *plenty* of great material to justify the purchase.
B00AEBBA36|5.0|I like it a lot. Has one of my favorite war movie lines, &#34;The next time that I see you, I am going to kill you.&#34;<br />This is from a gutsy helicopter pilot that has just been told to keep his helicopters out of harm's way by not flying cover for the ground troops. He refuses the order and saves the last American ground troops during a desperate bayonet charge against the NVA.
B000002L9J|5.0|Subsequent songs found on &#34;Louder Than Bombs&#34; and &#34;Strangeways&#34; may have been more accessible to the casual listener, but this is the penultimate Smiths album.  From the sinister title track to the irresistibly catchy &#34;Frankly Mr. Shankly,&#34; to... well, I'm about to list every track because there isn't a loser in the bunch.  I can easily listen to this entire album without hitting the &#34;skip track&#34; button.  The band seemed to be the most together and perform on this album with that great mix of confidence born of experience while still having the enthusiasm of being young artists.  It may take a few listens to get into it, but once you do, it'll never leave you.
B0006JGFNQ|4.0|It is what I expected.  Could be a little softer, but he's cute.  I bought it as a gift for a Gremlins fan.  He will love it, I'm sure.
B00008CLOA|5.0|Amazing sound quality on SACD.  5.1 mix is awesome.  Remaster is also topnotch.  Also, the price and availability make this a great upgrade.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Great story set in a modern time. Like all the Brandon Sanderson books I have read I couldn't put it down until complete.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a Fun game! It is very Addicting. I wish it had more levels. Update with more levels please.
B003K16P3M|4.0|This was a great book - I was gripped from beginning to end . The characters were tangible and enigmatic and you can feel katsa's emotions vividly - her irritation and rationale is quite clear. The only critique I have of this is that the climax was a little ... Well anti-climatic ... and I wanted to know more about the antagonist - what made him the bad guy - his motives and background. Overall, an exciting read I happily lost myself in.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you love the movie you will love this game, the minions are adorable!! Good for all ages. Highly addictive. Graphics are great.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Not so useful<br />Works good only with youtube.<br />Need to works with all the media players and formats.<br />Wish it was batter
B003L16FAE|5.0|Reading the reviews of Predator on Blu-Ray reminds me of a joke told by that masterful comedian, Louis C.K. He's on an airline flight and there's a momentary glitch in the movie his seat mate is watching. She's bent out of shape, how dare they drop a frame? You'd think it was her favorite frame. Louis observes that  this woman is flying through the skies at 600 miles an hour - that's six miles a second - at 39,000 nearly ten thousand feet higher than Mt Everest,using her I-Phone to watch a movie that's being beamed off a satellite 22,300 miles above the Earth and captured by the moving plane,  while enjoying a Vodka tonic. Even fifty years ago this scene would be science fiction, yet she felt the need to complain because her movie dropped a frame. Give me a break!!! So what if every pixel doesn't have the RGB value you would have liked - so what if the movie doesn't feature state-of-the-art CGI, or that the mini-gun can't be fired without an electrical connection. Some folks aren't happy unless they complain. Just wait until this film is re-released in 4K and then you can kvech that it isn't being shown in IMAX 3D!
B008KNUKVI|5.0|Ever since &#34;The Sing-Off&#34;, I've loved this group. They get better every year. Can't get enough of these guys! AWESOME!
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|The game is fun, challenging and addictive.  I sometimes sit for hours playing it. I am normally not a game player, but this one has me hooked. I find that it is similar to Candy Crush. I also purchased  the  original game.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Amazing I love how peeta and katniss get back together. It is amazing how the story always has action. Amazing
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Grandson loves this game,would recommend it for all ages. Gandson is 4 I'm 63 we have a lot of fun playing together
B003E6LC6I|4.0|Real interesting story line - great actors - interest use of flash backs and flash forwards - Watch it!  For a show about lawyers not a lot time spent in the court room, more about interaction between lawyers and the people they represent.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Really enjoyed the follow up to THE SHINING, one of my favorite Stephen King books.  The action drives the story forward and it was hard to put down.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is incredibly funny and honest in &#34;Bossypants&#34;.<br />Tina Fey is one of my favorite comedians.<br />I highly recommend this book!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It told the story of what, unfortunately, life was like in the South years ago.  I've read almost everything Grisham has written and it's different than most.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I am reading the Bible through cronological and that is very good.  I am listening which I enjoy but can only listen to the KJ version.  It does not work for me to listen in other versions and I would like that.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So frustrating and major fun - love playing Candy Crush Saga when I have a few minutes. It relaxes my mind to play it with total concentration :)
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This is a pretty good charger with a great price. I've only had it for a month but so far I haven't had any issues with overheating or my iphone not charging.  I'm using this with my iphone 5, just fyi.  Good deal!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think the game is great. It's also a way to keep kids happy and busy. My kids love the game.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|It didn't go off at specified time. It is not loud enough and it won't let you hear the different ringtones.
B00081912E|1.0|It is not working.  The dvd quit working 1/4 of the way through it is not my player because I put in another new dvd and it worked fine.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I hooked a non-geek on Marvel with this movie.  She loved the Hulk, and his 'Thor-punch' and the famous 'Loki thrash'.  Her words, not mine.
B00F1BFRA6|3.0|The German politician Otto von Bismarck said once, smart people do not learn from their own mistakes, but from those made by others. By this definition, Julian Fellowes is not very smart... He makes the same mistake so many drama television series have made before him: Too much drama! After killing two(!) most beloved main characters in series three, he just keeps the catastrophes coming (though no more deaths, thankfully). While, on the one hand, some characters suffer terribly, on the other hand, nothing much happens in \\"the bigger picture\\". There is not enough character development, no progress to the historical aspects like WWI before. Better end a good series with an unspectacular happy ending than let it go on to get hit by tragedies again and again until it dies ungracefully. While the last episode ends without further misfortunes, I cannot help but anticipate the next blow. I adored the last shot of the last episode of series three (note: NOT the Christmas special!): Lord Grantham, a son-in-law in each arm, all three of them laughing. THAT would have been a good ending to a good drama television series.

B000HKW7E0|5.0|A Christmas tradition in my family since the eighties. Hilarious!  A young Chevy Chase at his Clark W Griswold best.
1423113381|5.0|Carter Kane is always on the move with his Egyptologist dad, never in the same place for too long, while his younger sister, Sadie, lives with their grandparents in England. On one of their rare visits, Carter and his dad visit Sadie in England and they go to a museum on a normal &#34;outing.&#34; Carter is not impressed, he is always going to museums with his dad. Then their dad starts acting weird, other weird stuff starts happening at the museum, this leads to that and Sadie and Carter suddenly find themselves running for their lives and thrust into a world where Egyptian mythology in not just mythology-- it's very real!<br /><br />The gods have been unleashed (and they are closer than Sadie and Carter can imagine *snickers*) and Set is set (no pun intended, heh) on ruling the world. You know, typical evil stuff going on. Now it's up to the Kane siblings to, well, save the world. No pressure, right?<br /><br />It is no surprise that I absolutely LOVED this book! Rick Riordan is a GENIUS and I am just a huge fan of his! One thing I think is absolutely great is that you don't have to know about mythology in order to read his books! He weaves mythology into the story in a way that isn't overwhelming or boring, but instead very fun!<br /><br />I loved all the characters... Sadie is very sassy and fierce with a &#34;sharp tongue!&#34; I really liked her! Carter is also a great kid! He turns out to be a pretty brave, very strong hero, even if he doesn't feel like it at first. Bast is definitely one of my favorites! She is just such a fun kitty, playful, and yet very protective of her charges. Khufu was pretty awesome too... very smart baboon ;)<br /><br />There were so many layers in this story that make the book great as a whole. Another thing about Rick's stories is that there is always never-ending action, and I love that! His book are just a ton of fun and you will, without a doubt, find yourself laughing often! And of course, Rick is known for his major surprises and twists you do not see coming! I love being surprised and being like, &#34;What?! I did NOT see that coming!&#34;<br /><br />I really liked thid different take on the gods. You don't really worship them, per se, but instead you fight them and lock them away because Bad Bad Things will happen. I also liked how the book was structured to be like a recording... I thought that was very fun and unique. AND I loved the dual POVs! And then the Percy Jackson shout-out, EPIC! Amos's brow furrowed as he looked across at the Empire State Building. &#34;Manhattan has other problems. Other gods. It's best we stay seperate.&#34; -The Red Pyramid, pg. 52. Hi Mt. Olympus! *waves* :D<br /><br />I don't know what else to say beside GO READ THIS BOOK! It's amazing!and twists you do not see coming! I love being surprised and being like, &#34;What?!

B00B2JSRAS|1.0|It is irresponsible to tell those in need that they're just not praying hard enough. This attitude seems to be more of an escape from responsibility for bad people than anything else. Unless you are willing to go batpoop crazy with the author you will find only disappointment in this garbage.  Rich people stop thinking you're not rich and buying this stuff. Those who are actually broke beware.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This is what really happened. It was not a pretty picture. When it comes to the crucifixion part, the other movies about Christ don't do it any justice. Excellent movie by Mel Gibson.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I wonder if Veronica Roth was pushed to quickly write this last book in her series?  The writing was not very good in this final book.  The pov switches between Tris and Tobias, and the voices are identical.  I mean, seriously, in almost every chapter I had to turn to the start of the chapter to remember who was speaking.  I finally skimmed the last half of the book, realizing it wasn't going to get any better.  I knew about the ending after my teenaged daughter came crying into the room late at night to tell me how it ends (she won dibs to read it first).  The ending ruined the series but at least will save me the money that I would have spent on tickets to see the movie.  :)
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Ktkk.....excellent story & character description....The prologue was very interesting and a real page turner. Very descriptive throughout the entire story
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|The quality of the information is very good. It just seemed a little redundant. I got a little tired of hearing the same stories what seemed like over & over.
B006Y9BVRM|1.0|The included battery is dead 13 months later.  What is the point of having a solar watch when the battery does not charge after a year.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love this show.  It has humor, drama and real characters that you can care about.  British drama is just the best in my opinion!
B00FAVRHBE|5.0|Happy 50th anniversary to Doctor Who and to all of the Whovians, that kept in on the air these 50 years. Here is to 50 more!
B002UWH8P6|4.0|Great series, just love all the stargate series. Sad ended so soon. Hoping they would come up with another one.
B0055S348W|2.0|This app worked great and was free until recently, now they're charging $12.95 or is just an obsolete app. There are many free other apps to download.
B00459EZLW|4.0|Great series, just love all the stargate series. Sad ended so soon. Hoping they would come up with another one.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|There was nothing I didn't like about this book. His &#34;secret&#34; came out of left field and my heart raced throughout much of it. Easy read, up to date with technology and very relatable!!<br /><br />I quite enjoyed it.
B00DW3GFCY|5.0|Probably the most accurate story of the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese navy on 7 DEC 41. This film still used mock ups, models, and stock war department footage to depict the attack - no computer graphics here!<br />If you like history, this is the one to watch. The factual ending quote from the Japanese Admiral proved to be prophetic by the end of WW II.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ psych its a amazing game recommended for all who like robot boxing. its free if u didnt like it ( who would hate it ) no worry not a waste of ur money
B004SUDQ8Q|5.0|It was a values/character-based story without all the hype of special effects.  The violence was not explicit.  No bad language of any kind.  The suspense is built by superb acting.  The moral of the story is something our current politicians should take to heart!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What a great imagination Suzanne Collins has, but at the same time you saw a future that isn't all that unrealistic.  It brought out very strong emotion in me.
B006MOW98E|4.0|Loved the way the three stories all tied together.  Showed aspects of real life (people making mistakes, teens embarrassed by their parents, teens confused by real life) in a humorous way.  Dialogue was great throughout all of the stories. Good book to read at the beginning of the holiday season. Definitely a must if you are a fan of any one of these authors.
B007OLYQ4E|5.0|I  love love the quirkiness of Holly Golightly.  Haven't we all at one time or another wished we could throw caution to the wind and be a free spirit.  Truman Capote really captured this in Breakfast at Tiffany's.  I also loved the movie as Audrey Hepburn is one of my favorite.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Simple design, even though the  videos would better if they related to the area that the user is job. The ads are almost unnoticed by the user.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I give it a five star raiting. I loved the book and im sure you  will too!<br /><br />I loved it.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This starts then stops no matter how many times you try to reinstall it. The screen just goes black or freezes.
0345535529|5.0|My daughter is delighted with this gift and I am delighted as well. so far no issues :  0 happy
B008J8KBKY|4.0|It requires you to think and the visuals are very good. Each game doesn't take up a lot of time, this makes it good for filling in at time when you're waiting on someone or for something.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|There was just way to many things that they had tried to cram into one season, there were many story lines they didn't follow-up with that I thought would have added a lot to the show and a lot of the story lines they did finish felt rushed.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book kept me wondering.  So sad but so full of love.  Can't wait to read sequel.  Ending grips you to immediately purchase next book.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Such a good plot and kept me on my toes the whole time prefect read !!!! I just found MY favorite book
B003G4W49C|4.0|Hard to put down right from the first page and leaves you waiting for the next of the series. Quick read that is worthwhile.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush saga is the best game going right now... everyone you know is playing, just good clean fun trying to pass your friends on this game.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have owned my Chromecast for a couple months now, and can easily say it is the most used gadget in my house. Netflix, YouTube, and Pandora all perform incredibly well on this little device, and have improved my living room experience. With the Chromecast, I can easily go from TV off to watching House of Cards in 30 seconds flat - much faster than having to turn on your game device or smart DVD player to watch. You can also use a beta function in the Chromecast extension for Google Chrome that allows you to cast your entire desktop to the TV (much like AirPlay mirroring on an Apple TV). This works decently well, albeit fairly slow for me.<br /><br />Definitely going to be buying a couple of these as Christmas gifts this year.
0316322407|3.0|Excellent photos accompany this brave young woman's memoir of harrowing experiences in a book that will help middle school and high school students (and adults, too) to better understand distant, confusing events.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I read the book as a kid and the movie does not disappoint! The moral is classic and the cinematography is smooth and fluid.
B00CATSONE|5.0|An amazing work on tesla and his amazing ability to tap onto the inner genius. Loved the way the book has been structured
B00CHS31DG|5.0|Incredible app! I doubted that this worked at first but, my opinion has changed. The first night that my wife and I used it we got some very,very specific answers that no one would have known. We were both freaked out and touched at the same time. Very impressed with this app and it seems like a high quality tool for a great value.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|this sounds like old Black Sabbath, to bad Bill Ward isn't drumming, nice packaging, all the songs on the album are solid
B0058P7KUA|4.0|Very fun game my only issue was that the controls would mess up after playing for a couple of levels.
B000002KKC|4.0|this is a quality album even if its experimental, especially by Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks' and Christine McVie's songs are good
B00B1LN8WY|4.0|Love this show. I am not impressed with the video quality of the DVDs so far. I am hoping that it improves.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is not another story of the horrendous way in how the Germans treated the Jews during those days of darkness,but of the way that a few treated them with honor,humanity,and even love.  This is a story of hunger for life,love,and the fight for all human dignity.  A very beautiful tale of one girls life,and the goodness she brings to many others haphazardly becoming part of her world, through her own very personal losses.<br />.I loved the descriptions in this book and strength of the only weapons she had.Her Words.
006202406X|1.0|No Words other than very disappointing.<br />Dear Veronica Roth, this does not make you an edgy author, this makes you a cop-out.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Riveting story and great special effects in the main action scenes.  An excellent performance by Denzel Washington, and the supporting cast.
B007PJFFWC|4.0|a great movie enjoyed by everyone. the ending leaves everyone with tears in there eyes. would recommend to everyone that it is a must see.
B00BAXFAJC|4.0|It is a challenge to read but loved the story and love New Zealand and it's history. Well worth the effort on my part.
B00C9G22R2|4.0|Time for a sequel of his disciple that is Bruce Lee, another legend.  Beautiful scenes and masterful recreation of the turn if the wartime China.
B0084B5TK8|2.0|I have seen almost every Dracula movie made and they seem so far off from this story it is ridiculous.  It was work to read this novel, painfully boring and repetitive.  Dracula was almost non existent in it.  His story is the only reason I finally read this book.  I am very disappointed to say the least.  If you want to keep a romanticized idea of the Dracula from the movies and television, do not read this book.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I became a Black Sabbath fan after I came across a cassette tape back in 1973. Tony Iommi has always been my favorite guitarist. Period. His work with Dio was great as well as most of the other projects he has worked on. But to get 3 of the 4 original line up back on this work was needed and I think it is an awesome recording. This deluxe edition is the one to get. Put on &#34;Methademic&#34; and turn it way up! This is what &#34;real metal&#34; should sound like people! Ozzy has never sounded better. The bass work by Geezer complements Iommi in an almost supernatural way.  I am hoping the attorneys can step back and let Bill Ward come in for the next one. Please guys, keep putting out this magic sound! I need it!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|The story kept me reading, the characters kept me interested. Some of it seemed Grisham-predictable, but as usual, the story was entertaining.
0307743721|5.0|Munro is such a gifted writer that it's hard to not love every short story she creates.  Her depictions linger after each story comes to conclusion.  Subtly layered.  Great depth.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Could not put this one down! Great read...I would suggest you take a day off and enjoy from beginning to end!
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Part drama, part intrigue, part romance in a courtroom setting.  Great character development and story line.  This is a must see show.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|The ESV Study Bible is full of helpful tools to accompany the best Book ever written. And having it on my Kindle makes it portable. Love it!
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I am a big fan of Homme clear back to the Kyuss days. I like some of the things he has worked on since then, but primarily with Queens Of The Stone Age. I found this work is near perfection in so far as what I find interesting about music today. I think he is ahead of the curve and is not afraid to venture into new areas of story telling to a sonic backdrop. The live show of this project was awesome to see & hear. I hope he stays on this path.
B00EHMG358|5.0|It's Pendergast at his best. I went ahead an downloaded the audio as soon as it came out.<br />The narration is great, and the story does not disappoint. If you are a Pendergast fan, you can't miss this one.
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|I like this game. It is very logical and usually there are multiple places on the board where you can start.<br />You can play for a while, leave the game, turn off the game, change players, etc., etc., etc., and when you come back, you're right where you left off. That is a big...HUGE even...plus for me. I've played so many games that make you start over if you take a break...I like that you can play this on the train ride to work in the morning and pick up right where you left off when you get on the train to go home. There are three difficulty levels (see more about this a bit later) so you can play each of the many puzzles three times.<br /><br />I tested this with WiFi off and got no errors or nag screens. Tested on two tablets and a phone all running different anti-virus/anti-malware and none of them reported anything untoward.<br /><br />There are only knocks against the game, and both of them are stuff where I'm going &#34;I wish it did...&#34; and not really an error.<br />1) I feel...and many people might disagree with me...that there should be a super-easy difficulty level for (a) kids or (b) people who are just learning the game and want a two- or three-color option to ease their way into it.<br />2) The tilings should be randomized so you can play a puzzle over and over on the same difficulty level (kind of like how Minesweeper randomizes the tiling every time you play).<br /><br />This is a nice game that is easy in that you're not racing against a timer or anything, but challenging in that you do have to think about how those gems relate to the tiles around it.<br />(Hint: To start, look for a tile that has all the gems in it the same color...then you know the color of all the surrounding tiles.)<br /><br />As the Free App of the Day, there's no reason not to get this game. Evaluate it, see if it's your &#34;cup of tea.&#34; If not, you're not out anything.<br />I would recommend this to anyone who likes logic puzzles at 99 cents.<br />At the $1.99 asking price...I'd probably only recommend it to people I know are fans of this sort of game.king price...I'd probably only recommend it to people I know are fans of this sort of game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book is very thrilling!!! It was boring at first but when I got to the games I couldn't stop reading!!!!
B00DB2JQ7W|5.0|Bout time! Great CD. Warren Haynes is rated #26 in the world of guitarists. Gov't Mule is a super Blues rock band and this CD is no exception. Surprise 2nd CD with all kinds of guest artists is a nice addition.
B004BLDD9Y|1.0|I ordered 5. They were delivered quickly. They put out a bit less light than a 22 W CFL. It's a noticeable decrease. That's more or less what I expected. However, one of the 5 died after just a couple hours of use. For the cost of LED's I fully expect them to last as long as they claim.  ***UPDATE 5/22/16***  The last one just died. It flickers like a strobe light. I had bought a total of 6 in October 2013. It's May 2016 and all are dead. So 31 months. By my calculations that's around 23000 hours &#34;IF&#34; they had been left on 24/7. So not a single one made it to the quoted 30,000 hour life. In the lighting world a life of 30,000 hours means 50% should be burnt out, 50% should be working at 30,000 hours. The life on these is more like 10,000 hours. I lowered my rating from 2 stars to 1 star. These are obviously misrepresented as far as life cycle.   I have found some phillips 'slimstyle' LED bulbs that really do last. They go on sale at home depot once in a while for $3-4 and they have been great. I have around 14 or 15 installed and no burn outs in over a year.
B0025UHKNS|2.0|Battery life is very short, the bezel touch system doesn't work very well and I find myself constantly fiddling with it. No impressed.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was so much fun to play. But it was also very challenging. Also whenever I passed a level I felt like Sherlock Holmes.
B00AB7IA1S|5.0|This is a great logic game. You have a number of different fans and different types of fans (some of which are in limited quantities) and you have to use them to redirect airships so they 1) get from one hanger to another and 2) don't crash into terrain or other airships.<br />My kids love to push the \\"Make them fly\\" button and watch the airships go up and down over mountains, change direction, sail past each other. When they're older, they'll be able to set up the fans for themselves and practice logical, analytical thinking skills.<br /><br />I really like this game.<br /><br />I've tested the game with WiFi off and there are no issues. It has been tested on two tablets and a cell phone all running different anti-virus/anti-malware programs, and none of them have reported any issues.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It was a book that my teacher picked out for our reading group in school, she said we'd all like it and we did. It was almost impossible not to read ahead. Me and my friands can not wait for the movie to come out!!!
B006UW4OB8|5.0|Very useful to show all your Credit Cards as well as other card types, with respective details and/or pictures. It syncs with all your mobile phones, either Android or Apple. I have it in all my tablets and mobiles.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|THE BOOK TAUGHT ME A LOT OF HISTORY OF THE TIME OF JESUS.  IT ALSO GAVE ME LOTS TO CONSIDER AND TO DISCUSS WITH FRIENDS.  I AM GOING TO RECOMMEND THAT MY BOOK CLUB READ IT.
B00BAXFAJC|3.0|The gold rush in New Zealand was fascinating -- sent me to the atlas and online for maps and pictures.  The mystery was structured carefully, although the astrological signs were perhaps more meaningful for astrology buffs.  Going back and forth in time produced a bit of confusion, and the ending was less than satisfying, returning readers to the beginning of the tale rather than untying all the knots.
B00A50PDDY|5.0|Great group - great music!  Saw these boys in person and just had to have their CD.  Wish they got more radio play as they are terrific!
0316055433|5.0|The reviews, of course, have been rapturous and as it turns out they are so deserved! From the first sentence you know you are in for a read that requires a comfortable chair, a cup of tea and a lot of time because you are not about to get up for a  long time. Following a boy and the people he meets along the way requires time. Look how long it has taken you to get where you are.  And it has so been worth it! Just like this book.
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|This movie is very slow moving and really never ever gets going.  Predictable ending is very non climatic.  Some cool special effects earns the second star.
B00364K6YW|5.0|This is the best film adaptation I have ever seen.  Of course it is long, but it really does Jane Austen proud.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Fastest and most violent zombies that I've seen in a movie so far! As slow moving as I am,I would be doomed!
B0036G8IQS|5.0|best book I've ever read in my entire life I personally loved it!!!!!!!!! and its great for kids and its a good book to read in class and its really addictive!!!!!!!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read this series before the movies came but never did a review. Loved the book in any case and as usual the movie doesn't do it justice. Great storytelling and a semi believable dystopian future. Worth reading especially if waiting for the next movie.
B00E8B1358|5.0|Being a huge GI Joe fan (kid of the '80s) I'd always waited for a live action movie. In the '90s I got into the comic books and realized that there was some actual good story there and it was much darker and could easily make for a good film. The first movie was an abysmal disappointment, it was far too cheesy (think Transformers), too much comic relief, too many quadruple back-flips on motorcycles and other dumb things like that but they left out cool things like Cobra's iconic HISS tanks and such.<br /><br />This film was almost a complete 180 degree turnaround. It was far more like the comic books and had some actual story to it as well as a few interesting twists. The cheese factor was dialed down to where it should be (yes, a movie like this SHOULD have some cheese, but it should be in subtle details, not in Matrix-esque action sequences), Dwayne Johnson delivered a solid performance and this time around Cobra actually seemed like a menacing force, not just some generic terrorists melting the Eiffel tower with generic green movie &#34;goo&#34;.<br /><br />If you hated the first one but are a huge GI Joe fan please give this one a chance. It's good enough in my mind to at least warrant another sequel. They're moving in the right direction.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great game glad it finally made it to kindle. Reason it's one star short of perfect is because it did take forever for us kindle users to get an app.
0596007124|5.0|Foundational book for design patterns, distilled into an easier read than the Gang of Four book.  One of the good ones.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Intelligent, well written, well acted and extremely entertaining...one of the best shows since Mad Men!  I can't think of a better choice than Gabriel Macht and Patrick Adams as the lead actors.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I read this book in two nights....it was simply wonderful. I ask myself now why I did not read it earlier. This is one book that deserves the hype surrounding it.<br /><br />This book is a quirky love story with a difference.<br />Like most of us, Don Tillman has some eccentricities, his oddities mean that he finds it hard to have a relationship with many people, but most importantly with a female. Not only does he have high standards (BMI, IQ, non smoker, non drinker etc) he also needs someone that will not find fault in him. Don decides that the best way to reduce the number of horror dates he has to endure is to develop a questionnaire that will highlight the perfect woman for him.<br /><br />Don clearly has a form of high functioning autism yet is ambivalent to this completely...he thinks he is different to others only in ways that make him more superior. Don is such a loveable character and his journey to figure himself out and understand what he really wants and needs in a partner is funny, warm and insightful.<br /><br />I do agree with others that it was predictable and formulaic but I really did not care at all. I loved the twists and turns and the realness of the characters. I loved the hint of mystery and the growth of Don really hooked me in. Do I believe that someone with aspbergers or autism could change that quickly and deal with the things he does....perhaps not in the time frame in the book, but again I did not care...I just enjoyed the magical ride. I fell in love with Don wholeheartedly and I did not want the book to end.<br /><br />A must read for everyone!!!
B00BPDR3F6|3.0|Very well written book, interesting characters and thought provoking storylines, but way too much science and botany. Ending was disappointing and anticlimatic.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|This show is by far one of my favorite TV shows! I own every season and can watch over and over!
B00CS7ZIHI|5.0|I love this album!! I love 30STM & Jared Leto! Great buy! I listen all the time. LLF+D is great!
B000FBJG04|4.0|I loved the miniseries, Band of Brothers, which is the content of this book.  Interestingly enough, the series was extremely true to the story (albeit with creative control of the dialog).  Very good memoir of the most celebrated company of the second world war.
B008CH20DS|1.0|Most of the book is exposition and summary. There are very few actual scenes. Anne and Wentworth almost never talk to each other. He's ignoring her for the 99% of the story. When they talk in the end, their communication is summarized - we're told of what they discussed, but not shown the discussion. I know Austen can write scenes because she does it in her other works.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|All the models are beautiful. There is alot to choose from if you buy the full app. It is much more fun to buy the entire app.
0061950726|5.0|I love historical novels and this book truly met all of my expectations.<br />Since reading it, I have lent it to two friends and each of them finished<br />the book in one evening, could not put it down!!
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Visually stunning , but the premise is stupid. Really, is that how you fly a plane? At ground level? Missiles don't work except if a robot fires them? Please. Looks very cool though. Hell boy 1 and 2 were better films from this director. This was Godzilla vs. Robots. Great monsters and big dumb robots. Even so, I watched it twice. Wouldn't buy it, but had to see it. Love the 3.99 rental. Glad I didn't pay up to see it at the movies. - Note- a good sedative would have been a better solution to knock the monsters out. Also they breath,so, maybe some poison gas. Just sayin.
B0091Q82L8|5.0|This album is just fantastic and a must for the true Wholigan. My dad had been talking about this release for months after reading about it and then sadly we discovered it only was released in the UK, waiting a month for delivery was painful but fully worth it.
0062255657|5.0|Incredible! A man remembers what it was like to be a child, but with a fantastic twist. I called in sick to work so I could finish it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I rarely review a book before I've finished it.  If I do it's either because it's so bad I can't finish it or so because it's so good that I can't shut up about it.  The later is the case here.  The character Ender is totally relatable.  He's an ordinary kid placed in extraordinary circumstances.  His solutions to everyday problems are an inspiration.
B00BATG18K|5.0|Amy Tan is an amazing storyteller, and THE VALLEY OF AMAZEMENT exemplifies her skills. This is a multi generational story between mothers and daughters, as well as many other wonderful and important characters. The attention to detail and historical research that must have gone into the writing of this novel is mind-boggling. If you loved MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA, you will be fascinated by the details and lives of Tan's courtesans.<br /><br />I have read some criticisms of this book in other reviews, that it was too long or too romantic. Personally, I love a long novel if it doesn't drag. VALLEY did have its moments where I thought it got a bit slow or perhaps could have ended sooner, but the pace always picked up. Judging the length and story in totality, though, I can't say the slow parts decreased my enjoyment of it. As for the romance criticisms, I do not read romance and detest sickeningly sweet romance stories. Yet the romances in this book did not bother me a bit. In many ways, the romantic relationships were an intricate part of the core of the story.<br /><br />Overall, I really really enjoyed this book and almost wish it hadn't ended because I will miss the characters!
0307271609|5.0|It is disappointing that so many early reviewers of this book admit to little prior knowledge of Chinese history or of Empress Dowager Cixi. A basic understanding of the last century of the Qing dynasty and key factors such as the Opium Wars, the Taiping Rebellion, and the Japanese War of 1894-95 are essential context for evaluating Jung Chang's interpretation of Cixi's role.<br /> It is rewarding, however, to know that recently opened archives are allowing for re-interpretation of this powerful woman. Reviewers reading from pre-publication copies without sources had serious blinders. Jung Chang's radical re-interpretation of Cixi demands evaluation of her sources, provided in endnotes and a lengthy bibliography in the published edition.<br /> Emperor Dowager Cixi has been badly served by historians for over a century for several reasons -- most dramatically because she was a woman in an era and a culture when women were isolated from public power. All of her actions from 1861 through 1889 were done in the name of her son and her adopted son -- the designated &#34;Sons of Heaven.&#34; Her decisions were literally issued to counselors from behind a yellow curtain behind the throne occupied by a 5-7 or 9-year-old boy.<br /> This was a critical period of Chinese history in the conflict between the traditional Confusion elite committed to China's position as the center of the world and reformers who witnessed Chinese humiliation by Western gunboats forcing them to yield treaty ports controlled by Western laws, massive indemnity payments, and openings to Christian missionaries. Historians have placed Cixi among the traditionalists rather than recognizing her true role as a reformer encouraging students to study abroad, building a significant Chinese navy for defense, launching the Bejing to Wuhan railroad, supporting Chinese culture with a national flag and developing Peking opera, among other things.<br /> When she retired and allowed her adopted son to rule on his own,the country's reversion to traditionalism led to the disastrous Japanese war and territorial challenges from Russia, Britain, France, Germany, and the US and a plot to kill Cixi that she discovered and foiled. She imprisoned her son, but avoided revealing his participation in the plot to preserve her own authority acting in his behalf. She made the horrendous mistake of supporting the Boxers to fight foreign incursions because China's army was inadequate. Her enemies allied with Japan painted her as the demon behind the throne. Only after she admitted her errors and began actively working with foreign diplomats did she accomplish the remarkable reforms of her last years. But her attempts to work through Chinese leaders to create a constitutional monarchy were thwarted by her death.<br /> Although it is beyond the scope of this book, it is intriguing to compare Cixi's role to the more recent role of Communist reformer Deng Xiaoping, working first through Mao and then on his own. Does Jung Chang's revisionist history lean too heavily in Cixi's favor or does she rescue a much maligned woman? That is a question serious readers will enjoy considering.
B00DP94Z2W|5.0|Amazing album! For everyone expecting a &#34;Metallica&#34; sound, look else ware. Jason has moved on to bigger and better things! Love this effort!
B000NY17J6|5.0|Love this beautiful collection of one of the greatest singers ever.  Can anyone sing Desperado or Blue Bayou better than Linda?  I don't think so....
B00F880BWG|5.0|full of suspense and action.....Riveting . I bought each episode so I could go back and watch each episode more than once.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|works well. Can't see any problems with it. I like checking the daily deals on this. I recomend it for Ebay fans
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|This young girl did an excellent job telling her story, which is a very remarkable, compelling one. This book opened my eyes about many Muslims & life in Pakistan. Malala & her family are amazing people, her dad wanted all good things for her & did not fit the image of other fathers of daughters that you read about in the Muslim world. How wonderful it would be if all Muslim men saw women the same way he did & were advocates for education & equality for women.
B002RL7W9W|5.0|This is for my Grandson for Christmas so I haven't really looked at it yet. I sure it will be perfect because he loves Lego's and also the Star Wars movies etc.  I can tell you more after Christmas and he has opened it.
B00GBCMW9S|4.0|Really enjoy most of the songs. there is only a handful of songs that I don't really care for. Also its only 8 bucks.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Not gonna say to much because I don't want to spoil anything and because I am up really late right now since I stayed up to finish the book. I am going to say that this book is a must read for people who like sci-fi, plot twists, or fast paced books. This is one of those books where you need to take a break now and then to say \\"Holy cow\\". (Amazon censoring) it has an amazing storyline that gets into the interesting parts from the beginning of the book. This is not the kind of book that will disappoint you.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is a fun and challenging game, I look forward to the next challenge. Also seeing which friends score higher or lower that I do.

B008JFUOVI|3.0|Much darker than the first two. If you are a fan of Allen and Mr. Chow, then you will probably like this movie. The other characters aren't given much to do than to react and curse loudly.
B00E9ZATJO|5.0|Got this for the grandkids when they come see us. I know they'll love it (and I will too) we play the first DVD Monster's Inc. all the time.
B00G32OER4|5.0|Scary As Hell and exceptionally well done great paranormal/demonology movie in fact one of the best I've ever seen, the characters were very well played by the actors has a realistic feel to it. It's about a nice family being terrorized by an evil force, one thing that I found super creepy is when the little girl is dragged across the floor across the room then thrown into a wall by something invisible, there's lots of other scary stuff in this one far better than I expected
B005OV0PS2|5.0|Way out west there was this fella... fella I wanna tell ya about. Fella by the name of Jeff Lebowski. At least that was the handle his loving parents gave him, but he never had much use for it himself. Mr. Lebowski, he called himself &#34;The Dude&#34;. Now, &#34;Dude&#34; - that's a name no one would self-apply where I come from. But then there was a lot about the Dude that didn't make a whole lot of sense. And a lot about where he lived, likewise. But then again, maybe that's why I found the place so darned interestin'. They call Los Angeles the &#34;City Of Angels.&#34; I didn't find it to be that, exactly. But I'll allow there are some nice folks there. 'Course I can't say I've seen London, and I ain't never been to France. And I ain't never seen no queen in her damned undies, so the feller says. But I'll tell you what - after seeing Los Angeles, and this here story I'm about to unfold, well, I guess I seen somethin' every bit as stupefyin' as you'd see in any of them other places. And in English, too. So I can die with a smile on my face, without feelin' like the good Lord gypped me. Now this here story I'm about to unfold took place back in the early '90s - just about the time of our conflict with Sad'm and the I-raqis. I only mention it because sometimes there's a man... I won't say a hero, 'cause, what's a hero? But sometimes, there's a man. And I'm talkin' about the Dude here. Sometimes, there's a man, well, he's the man for his time and place. He fits right in there. And that's the Dude, in Los Angeles. And even if he's a lazy man - and the Dude was most certainly that. Quite possibly the laziest in Los Angeles County, which would place him high in the runnin' for laziest worldwide. But sometimes there's a man, sometimes, there's a man. Aw. I lost my train of thought here. But... aw, hell. I've done introduced him enough
B00A8ECU24|3.0|great game lower the prices in the store need to be able to get lots more gems and money especially in canterlot I mean come on 40000 for a store

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I originally downloaded this app for my 4 year old. We play together and love it! The graphics are so beautiful. We get a kick out of touching the fish to make them swim fast or making Bloat puff up.
B0091VYG86|4.0|I really like the B&W concept of the movie, I would have given 5 stars most likely if I'd been able to watch the move uninterrupted. Hopefully I'll give it another try soon.
B000X1T7MS|5.0|Loved this book for its logic and the tour through history, from Mohammad to today. The Crusades may be the reason we live in freedom in the West today - they stopped the muslim warriors to forcibly convert all europeans. But now Islam is on the rise again... A must read for all non-muslims.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|I am a die hard Rock fan, so he can do no wrong. This is better than the first GI Joe ( Duke is an officer now? and he cant shave even in his Class A's?) But it is formulaic a bit and contrived. Still a really fun popcorn movie and Snake Eyes kicks butt!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Great definition and game idea. Kids love it! A lot of thought and hard work went into this game its definately worth a try!
140006922X|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It really helped me to understand what life was like back in those days. It cleared up a lot of confusions that I had on the bible. I had read or heard a lot about some of the different stories that were in this book from other sources. But I had never had all the information that I needed to have an intelligent understanding of it all. I only had bits and pieces but never the whole story. I felt through reading this book that I got a lot of my questions answered. I believe that there are some real answers for those who don't want the painted version of the bible. Reza Aslan provides a real glimpse of what life was like back in those days when Jesus walked. This is a very intelligently written book that is fairly easy book to read; that is very enlightening.
B0012PDVQ2|5.0|A great movie. This is the first time I've watched the Final Cut version and it is so much better than the other versions. It surprisingly still holds up very well after all these years. If you haven't seen Blade Runner, watch this version first, then go back and watch the others. But really, this is the only version you really need.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Mr Grisham has written better books than this. The story didn't capture me until the very end, flat and boring for the most part: initially, just a banal dispute to which one would not even bother with but with little gossip over coffee.<br />I don't believe mr Grisham has outdone himself, this time.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|How can you not like it?  It brings you Kindle books to your android tablet or phone seamlessly and smoothly.  I've had this app since before I bought my first Kindle (I now have 3 different ones).  No hassle purchases for your books and a huge selection.  Many, many free books, as well.  Thank you again, Amazon.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Beautifully written. Don't read if someone you love<br />has just passed from cancer, some parts can be hard to read, very beautifully sad.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I really love this artist. Her music has a lot of soul. I hope to see her around for years to come, making music. She has a rare gift for producing music that speaks to the soul. This is a very uplifting CD.  She puts so much heart into her music that you cannot help but be moved by her music. I feel it is her heart in her music that speaks to your mind and your soul. She has true talent. Her talent is rare in this day and age. I hope that she can influence other artist to put more heart into their music. Thank you for caring enough to share your talent with the world. Musically you have made it a better place.
B003SI7OQ4|3.0|My 5 year old son and I watched this together. It was much funnier than I thought it would be, but the animation looks a little dated compared to what you see today. It was OK for my son, a little scary at times, and a little over his head, but he really enjoyed it. Of course, he hasn't asked to watch it again, so I wouldn't put it up there with his favorites.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|this movie showed the real meaing of segregation from then to now.  though you may not see it now everyone is human no matter what race they are
B009LMTDL0|4.0|A motivating book at first, but lost me once all the baby talk came in. I'm a woman with no children so it became somewhat hard for me to relate once she went there, but I understand why she did. Definitely a good read for women manuevering through what sometimes feels like a corporate maze.
B004WKOCP8|5.0|I Love Incubus' progression as artists.  I find this album very moving and I love it as much as their other albums.  I choose this one when I'm in a mellow mood ;)
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I downloaded this app to help with sleep anxiety and block out the sounds from the neighbors (crummy soundproofing) and it has helped on both fronts.
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|I love playing ganes like this one. Logic games like CrossMe and Sudoku and the like are by far my favorites. This one  easily joins the ranks of those. You have to use logic and deduction to fill in the cells with the correct colors.<br /><br />The tutorial is very helpful. 23 pictures, 69 levels overall between three modes. Even better we also get the Zoo app for free as well due to how the developers have it set up. Two great apps for free.
B0049J0CTM|3.0|It's Pixar, it's great. What more can you say? I guess I'd say it's not my favorite Pixar film, but still very good. If you have young sensitive kids, you might want to skip the first few minutes. Disney has a thing about parents dying, and I forgot about that when we watched it with my 5 year old. There were a lot of questions about that part for the next few days. It
0805047905|5.0|In my opinion this book is perfect for the little ones. As a matter of fact it has been favored by many different little ones again and again.  This book is very sturdy since the cover and pages are made from a nice, thick board. Pictures are funny and colorful. Plus, this book provides a good opportunity for little ones to learn how to handle a book and they discover that reading is fun~~~whether someone reads it to them, or they learn to sight read the words and read the book to a delighted listener!  They will choose this book again and again. How do I know?  Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? has been kid approved many times!  I highly recommend.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|Replaced my old HP12C that finally bit the bullet. Looks better than the old gold colored version and functions like it should. Fast shipping too.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I haven't finished the book yet.  So far though, it's pretty interesting and believable.  I also like having a face for some of these characters, having seen the movie &#34; A Time to Kill'.  I only hope that Lettie's Army daughter isn't going to fill in the Sandra Bullock character for us.

B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Makes sense to a medical professional.  Lost 6 lbs. Since starting 4 weeks ago.  Simple to practice.  But don't skip actually reading the book...it's important information to make it work.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|If you know what you are getting into, it's a lot of fun. I mean, it's monsters fighting robots, so what more do you want, a story? Nah, just have fun watching the action which is great. I wish Transformers would have used robots and action in this style so you could tell what was actually going on. Anyway, enjoy the ride.
B00GIXWXEO|5.0|Great movie...who'd  have thought you could like a movie about snails!  Loved by kids and adults.  Great job by voice overs!
B003GQM52Q|5.0|I wish I had watched this one prior to \\"Tombstone.\\" This movie seemed to be more historically correct. It told how Wyatt Earp got his start. I enjoyed Tombstone more.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Great book<br /> This book was  full of useful data.  Long overdue premise on what we should be eating and why.  Diet is very workable.  You can feel the difference after only a few weeks.
B00513DGIO|5.0|A text this important is remarkably rare. Graeber lays out the corpse of our contemporary \\"society\\" and dissects it expertly to reveal the metastases within. We live in a world plagued by a religious devotion to bullion which is all consuming.
B004NS710C|4.0|Good action movie.  Amazing how can you spend a full hour watching a runaway train and keep interested.  Another movie where a man does what he needs to do, regardless of the cost to himself.
B003ES61EE|3.0|I found it a little inferior to the brand-name LensPen products.  The cap tends to come off easily and the end element (cleaning surface) is quite small.<br /><br />It works great on a small-lens such as a point-and-shoot or view finder, but not so well on a full size DSLR lens.  The brush tends to want to pop out as the slider is a little &#34;loose&#34;

B00915G6MG|5.0|If you are a NCIS fan the 10th season is a must.  I have purchased the DVD's every year when available and while I don't think the 10th season writing/shows were all that good, it was the last full season for the Coty's character, Ziva, so worth purchasing the DVD for closure.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I love Google Chromecast.  What a great alternative to having cable.  It does disconnect every now and then, but now often.
B00BSBR9N6|2.0|WON'T FINISH IT. I disliked the characters to the point I did not wish to spend time reading more about them.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Its got good visuals and tight game-play. that's about all that can be said, its a mobile game so it doesn't really excel in any area.
B00D23GXB2|4.0|Revenge of The Orgasm is a collection of  Poems chronicling the life of G.P.A. through various Erotic encounters. Through exceptional prose, vivid words create sounds, smells and tastes for the reader to consume. G.P.A talent, although not for everyone, stirs intimate emotions with an underlying hint of sorrow. If you enjoy Poetry and are willing to go in with an open mind, you should definitely pick this one up.
B008JFUPFI|4.0|This is by far the best Superman movie to date, but it does, unfortunately have some problems as well.<br /><br />(Likely spoilers ahead.)<br /><br />First, I especially liked the way the movie portrayed the Kryptonians having to adapt not only to earth's different atmosphere, but also to there new found powers. It always bothered me that every other Superman story (Superman II, Lois and Clark, Smallville) that involved Zod (or other evil Kryptonians) had them mastering their abilities as if they had them all their lives (Smallville being the worst offender, as Zod and his pals had greater mastery of their powers than even Clark had).<br /><br />Second, I liked how they skipped the hidden identity (at least from Lois). It has been done to death and, as most Superman fans know, the two are cannonically an item (married even) so I'm glad they did not feel the need to go back to the &#34;will she find out and when&#34; scenerio of previous incarnations. This does lead to one logic problem, though. If Lois can find out so easily, why can't anyone else?<br /><br />I really liked the way Jor-El was protrayed as well - as the father that inspires his son to greatness. This also leads to my biggest problem with the movie - Jonathon Kent. Worst incarnation ever. On the one hand he is telling Clark that the type of man he will become, for good or for evil, will change the world, but then he's teaching his son that it is OK for him to let a bus load of school kids die in order to maintain his secret identity. Then, later, after telling Clark he is here for some great purpose, he's angry with Clark for not wanting to be a farmer. Farmers are great and all, but it does not take superpowers to be one. That would be am obvious waste of Clark's abilities. His death was just plan lame as well. Better to have had Clark just reminising about his father at his grave and saying how he beleived that the world was not ready. Too bad he did not hear Jor-El in the beginning when Lara said &#34;He'll be an outcast. They'll kill him.&#34; The simple response was &#34;How?&#34;<br /><br />The next problem issue for me was the battle at the end. Drawn out and the CGI, while looking good, did not feel real. This is one area where Superman II out did this with the &#34;less is more&#34; motto. The battle felt real in Superman II. It was more video game like in MOS. (Still, I liked MOS much more than SM2).<br /><br />Finally, the final solution concerning Zod was very well done. I know there are a lot of viewers that don't like it, but I found it the most realistic and moral choice Superman could have made given the circumstances. Seriously, how is Superman going to subdue and detain Zod? But instead of going the easy, convenient death that the hero is not responsible for (such as Green Goblin in the Spider-Man movie), they forced Superman to make the hard choice. In the end, he made the correct (though painful) choice.
B000063UR1|3.0|This was ok.  I liked the premise of the movie, and I liked that it was mostly realistic, basically an example of what's called \\"hard sci fi\\" today.  It doesn't deal with the problem of gravity on board, though like most sci fi shows it seems to imply that the ship has some kind of artificial gravity--a bit of a cheat, but at least a common one.<br /><br />The acting is so-so, though the performance by the main character is strong.  The drones are shown as having some level of emotion, which we know today is pretty unrealistic, but back then it was still reasonable to think that smart enough machines would naturally gain some kind of feelings.<br /><br />It made sense that the main character had to end things the way he did, but the technical side of the ending didn't work.  It takes him forever to work out that his plants aren't getting enough sunlight?  Shouldn't that have been obvious to a professional botanist?  And at the very end, how long are the lights in that habitat going to stay on now that it's been disconnected from the ship's power supply?  It seems to me the end of the movie wasn't fully thought through.<br /><br />So, while I wouldn't put this on any list of top-tens, it's is a good solid sci fi movie and it's worth a watch.
0618918248|5.0|Although this book has been out for a while, the message in it rings true. It may cause consternation for some weak-willed, self-deluded folk who are indebted to social groups like 'The Church'.  But they should be open-minded enough not to shun science-based facts.
B004PHE9F6|5.0|Saw it in Wide-screen Cinerama when it first came out. Still impressed. Thank God for blu-ray and high def TV's.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Great book that I keep rereading.  Lots to ponder and well-written.  I would recommend this to anyone to analyze one's self and how to work and communicate with others.
B00F91SCXC|2.0|the movie had a really great primis,  and potential. it just fell short.  It did not keep my interest or make me care about the characters.  My 11 year old boy liked it. he thought the supper fast zombies were cool.
B003M70O5O|5.0|All the DVD's' worked in my Sony Blue-Ray Player in season's  1 and 2.  Season's 3-4 on both disks 2and3; it said I needed to update my DVD player. It also said I needed to read the manual which told me nothing that could or would help. I finally was able to delete the data that was on the DVD player; By removing the disks and shutting off the power.  After all that,  then it played just the show.  It still never let me watch any extras like the deleated scene, gag real, ect.  . This is the first time at has happened with any of my Blue-Ray DVD's.  I have bought several Blue-Ray DVDs from this year 2012-2013, both TV shows and Movies.. My player is plugged into Wi-Fi and is only 2 years old.  Season 5 played with no problems including the deleted scenes and the extras.. I am giving 5 stars because I don't know if it is my DVD player or the Disks.<br />The first time I watched the show was on Amazon Prime.  I was hooked and knew I had to buy the series. We have watched the Series twice in one week.  Great Show!!
B00F4BJ4M0|5.0|Stop the complaints. This reissue has better sound. That being said certain tracks are not repairable and were put on this collection for historical purposes. Read the last page of the liner notes and it explains. Another reason to purchase this is the booklet is gorgeous. Included are more pictures as well as the same pictures enhanced. The quality of the booklet is nicer also. Certain pictures were omitted, but they were of no significance and the replacements are much nicer. Seriously, the over all package is much better.
B00BMGUIJE|3.0|Have to say the figurine I received today was a fake from china. There were miss spellings on the print of the packaging, it didn't have the official bandai logo or toei animation sticker on it and it didnt say that it was a Figuarts Zero design. Looking closely at the figurine I feel that its still well made but just not as finely detailed as the one pictured. I am still debating if I want to return it but looking as I paid $15 dollars less than the current $45 dollars +shipping, I will just end up keeping it. Its still a nice figurine.
B004QXJZXA|5.0|One of my top 5 favorite movies of all time. The best racing movie of all time. Thank God for blu-ray and high def TV's.  The audio still gives me chills.  Sorry Ron, I've seen Rush twice now and like it, but it isn't as good as Steve's.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This game is fun to play by yourself or with friend's. Can be challenging so be careful with your hints.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Let me start by saying I have loved every book written by J.K. Rowling until....  This book still has her wonderful way with words, but with so little point in this dirgy drama.  The story was oh so tiresome, populated with every form of loser.  The only character not a complete waste of plasma was dead by page 5.  As social commentary, I thought it was a failure.  Sorry Ms. Rowling.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Great show happy to have it on DVDs .  Streaming is still to new to buy a whole series and hope it will still be there to watch again in 3 to 5 years later.  I still watch Movies and TV shows 3-5-7-and 10 years later.  Both on VHS tapes and DVD's.
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|I give it 5 stars simply because it was so well done in every respect. All the acting was remarkable. The detailing of the production was painstaking and almost loving. Unfortunately, our human nature is ghoulish in that we must always dig people up after they're gone and pick them apart, just to be sure they had feet of clay like the rest of us. Although if Liberace had been straight, this disinterment would not have occurred and this movie would never have been made; it would have been boring. I am sorry Liberace will not be remembered for his musicality, his ingenuity, even his thrift, and for the hard working American success story he really was. I have worked in music and the piano business for over 40 years. My compatriots and I regret there is no longer a Liberace to popularize piano ownership and piano playing.
B00FLDG5BE|5.0|Just released today in Sydney Australia. Well, I can tell all you folks out there to buy it, although it may not be quite as  good as the last offering, dominated as it was by Derek Trucks, Los Lobos and Bill Murray. Well, Trucks and Los lobos are back, but no Susan Tedeschi.<br /><br />So, to the DVD. Some good and sort of OK highlights:<br />Los Lobos as professional as ever, with a young fella equipping himself quite well behind the kits. He looks like Punky Brewster, and about 16 yrs old, but plays very well. On the Needle and the Damage Done, Greg Allman sings well, but it's Trucks on the slide that lends a subtle beauty to the song's melody.<br /><br />On Tumbling Dice, Urban comes out swaggering like some CMC jock, and plays Tumbling Dice in a serviceable if not particularly great rendition.<br />Jeff Beck is excellent and plays here with his regular bassist Tal Wilkinfeld, probably in her 20s now, and a joy to watch and hear. Her rapport with Jeff Beck now is easy to sense. Which is more than I can say for Beth Hart, who Beck largely ignores as she tramples around on stage dominating proceedings. She sings fine, but am I the only one who finds her just a tad over-rated ?<br /><br />Jeff Beck's Mna Na Heireann is a beautiful interlude, with some electric violin intoning exotic sounds. I really liked this, in spite of being a little out of context.<br /><br />A guy called Blake Mills came on (never heard of him) and sang a crooner ballad that did nothing for me, but being unfamiliar with the guy, I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />The Booker T segments are excellent, with Cropper, Matt Guitar Murphy, Lee and that Mills guy again taking turns at lead breaks. Excellent, and Booker T is having fun, probably more fun than the ill-fated stuff he did with Drive By Truckers a few years back.<br /><br />Another player I was unfamiliar with, Kurt Rosenwinkel played some light jazz guitar in a similar vein to Wes Montgomery. I could  have done without it, but I'm not questioning the quality of the musicianship.<br /><br />All the rest is predictably good, with Warren Haynes and Greg Allman lending a professional air to the evening's entertainment, and Clapton looking and sounding pretty good. I still preferred the last two DVDs but anyone even remotely enjoying classic rock and rhythm and blues will not want to miss this. I gave it 5 stars because, at the end of the day, I won't be churlish. There are some fabulous musicians on offer, and a few ornery moments doesn't change the fact that this is a music lover's basic diet, right here.stioning the quality of the musicianship.<br /><br />All the rest is predictably good, with Warren Haynes and Greg Allman lending a professional air to the evening's entertainment, and Clapton looking and sounding pretty good.

031623480X|5.0|Intersting stuff here. Read it and decide whether your grainy goodness is worth the potential risk of being a demented basket case. In all seriousness though, read it and become enlightened.
B008JFUR10|3.0|It's a good movie. Honestly I expected the CG in a movie with a higher budget to have more realistic creatures and robots (Transformers were better) but overall I would give it 3 stars. The lead players are primarily what kept me from giving it 4 stars. The idea for the movie was good but a better performance by the acting crew would certainly have given it a boost. I'm not sure who would have been the best performers in this type of movie but at in my mind, big budget films deserve big name stars. The only one I can think of that has recently proven that wrong is the new Star Trek movies.
B000SGSU58|4.0|It was a good story with lots of twists. I really enjoyed it and I'd recommend it to mystery lovers.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I got this app as the app of the day, and I instantly fell in love with it! I beat it rather quickly, and I was surprised that it wasn't longer. I hope fireproof games makes another one! because this is like my favorite game EVER!
B004GYY714|5.0|It has all of my local stations as well as an awesome selection of others to choose from and works flawlessly.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I love the old movies and these have everything. They don't make them like this anymore and I really enjoy that we have the opportunity to own them.
B00ENNA62W|5.0|TETSUO!<br /><br />Best animation I have seen (except for Redline but this was made 20 years before Redline).<br />This is one of those movies that everyone should see to appreciate.
B008BGNMZU|5.0|I own a number of Fourplay albums and I have never been disappointed with any of them.  The musicians who team up int hese projects are stellar on their own and very connected as an ensemble.
B00CP4RZIO|5.0|I've been a big fan of Chimaira for 10 years now ever since I was 19 years old when I first listened to both their 2001 debut release \\"Pass Out of Existence\\" and their breakthrough sophomore release from 2003 \\"The Impossibility of Reason\\" back in 2003, and since then I would get every forthcoming album of theirs in the years to come afterwards. I've also have had the pleasure of seeing them live at the Oxford Theatre down in Eau Claire back in late September, and they just absolutely killed it live onstage. I mean they were absolutely amazing, it was truly an amazing experience. Now, for Chimaira's seventh full length release, 2013's \\"Crown of Phantoms\\", we see frontman Mark Hunter being joined by an all new lineup consisting of Daath members Emil Werstler (lead guitar), Jeremy Creamer (bass), Sean Zatorsky (keyboards and electronics), ex-Dirge Within rhythm guitarist Matt Szlachta, and ex-Bleed The Sky drummer Austin D'Amond, and together this new lineup has managed to bust out what is in my opinion, the best Chimaira album since 2007's \\"Resurrection\\" by far. While \\"Crown of Phantoms\\" showcases a fresh sound here, but it still maintains the attitude that Chimaira have so well been known for throughout the years. The music on this album is just devastatingly brutal and heavy, and each song is just downright addicting and memorable. Mark Hunter proves that he still knows how to bring it as he powers his way throughout with his powerful, aggressive growls and screams as always. The riffs on here are absolutely heavy and devastating, and Emil Werstler's solos are just fantastic and very technically sounding too. This album truly shows that Emil definitely has his own unique lead guitar style, and very much different from former lead shredder Rob Arnold, and it definitely grabs your attention and just sucks you straight inside and gives you that awesome feel throughout. Elsewhere, Austin D'Amond delivers an outstanding and all around solid performance behind the drums with plenty of double bass action, great fills and solid beats throughout, and the keyboards and electronics on here also continue to be integral to Chimaira's sound, providing a layer of atmosphere somewhat unusual for bands of their ilk.<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />The album's opening track \\"The Machine\\" gets things going on a strong note beginning with a Fear Factory-like intro and then pulverizes the listener's ears with a barrage of heavy, energetic riffing and pounding beats, and there's also a great shredding solo from Emil thrown in midway through as well. Elsewhere other highlights here such as \\"No Mercy\\" (my favorite track) is highlighted by an addictingly tasty chorus, as well as crushing, pummeling riffs, angry growls, and another fantastic solo to boot, as well as \\"All That's Left is Blood\\" which features more punishing riffage, plus more menacing vocals, along with crushing and clobbering rhythms, plus another shredtastic solo, and a ferociously pumping chorus that will seriously pump your blood like nuts. Track five \\"Plastic Wonderland\\" is yet another highlight that features a dark and moody yet melodic clean guitar intro which then leads into some busy, churning riffs and drilling double kick action, plus there's yet another awesome Emil solo thrown in as well. Other highlights on this album here include track eight \\"Spineless\\" which boasts more clobbering riffs, aggressive drumming along with some rolling double bass fills, plus another wailing solo, and hate driven growls from Mark, elsewhere \\"Kings of the Shadow World\\" features more punishing riffage and pummeling double bass drumming, plus an impressive and spiraling sweep induced solo as well as a nice piano outro, meanwhile \\"Wrapped in Violence\\" is yet another blistering and heavy number anchored by slow yet devastating riffs and more sinister vocals that just crush and pummel your senses, and of course the album's epic and sinister final track \\"Love Soaked Death\\" which is highlighted by asteady, yet bone crushing groove along with more excellent riffing and drumming throughout, as well as another great solo and killer vocals to boot.<br /><br />So in overall conclusion and a very positive one that is, \\"Crown of Phantoms\\" is an all around fantastic metal album that will just annihilate your senses with it's devastating and ever so impressive musicianship from start to finish. This album has gotten repetive listens in my CD stereo ever since I first got my hands on it back in late September after seeing them live, and it has definitely shaped up to be one of my favorite metal albums of 2013 as well. As I mentioned before \\"Crown of Phantoms\\" still manages to maintain the attitude that Chimaira are so well known for, while showcasing a fresh new sound and indeed proves that with this fresh new lineup, Chimaira are back better than ever. Anyways, if you're a longtime fan of Chimaira like myself, by all means \\"Crown of Phantoms\\" is a definite must have...Strongly Recommended!!!<br /><br />\m/steady, yet bone crushing groove along with more excellent riffing and drumming throughout, as well as another great solo and killer vocals to boot.<br /><br />So in overall conclusion and a very positive one that is, \\"Crown of Phantoms\\" is an all around fantastic metal album that will just annihilate your senses with it's devastating and ever so impressive musicianship from start to finish.

B00EUVG3P6|4.0|I've been building PCs as a hobby for about three years and always go to the Pentium Dual-Core line as my CPU of choice. Why? Because I'm not playing games or using Photoshop or editing video. I use computers to surf the Web, check my email and write the occasional Word document. If that's you, then save yourself some money and get a CPU like this one. The hyper-threading capabilities of Intel's Core i3/i5/i7 line is great, but for basic computing it's a waste.<br /><br />I've dropped Pentium Dual-Core CPUs into two units I built for myself as well as five computers I built for a doctor's office. No complaints from them or from me.

B003G4W49C|5.0|I have read this book twice with my children !  It is a great book for children, and reads easily.
B00F5HWC7W|5.0|It has many of the Killers' hits, but there are several other songs that are missing that I wish were included in the CD, but then again there is the limit of how many song can be included.  Needless to say, the two new songs are amazing! I can't wait for them to release more!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This movie ranks as one of my all-time favorites.  With beautiful imagery expertly filmed plus a compelling (though classic) story line and excellent music, this is a no miss film for most.  Standard quality recording also -- at least of DVD.  I do not own a Blue Ray player yet.
B000FC11JW|5.0|It is one of the best business books and can be used like a reference book for management. This book is considered one of the best books ever of its kind.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|What can you say.....John Grisham can tell a story. I enjoyed this book immensely and have read all his books. I left off 1star if only because at times it was monotonous and maybe not as good as past books. But that is only because of the high standard he has set.
B005V5WBFG|5.0|Your big blue but had little to contract work out the hunger strike in the voice with sharia and practice in the voice with sharia
B000KRNCYY|5.0|Loved the CD. The Celtic Woman have beautiful voices. The songs were great and I could listen to the CD every day.
B003XL6EKS|5.0|His music is great! The Killers as a group are amazing, but this guy is very very talented.  His CD is a must have and it comes with this little poster thing.
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|I have been waiting for this movie to be on sale after renting it last year.  It is very funny, especially if you have an English sense of humour, and is still good for little kids.  I have a 3 and a 1 year old who both like it and the 3 year old is finally picking up the spirit of Christmas so this is a fun way to show her how Santa delivers all of the gifts.
B00CGNYDIE|4.0|Definitely a fun game.  It is an interesting spin on minefield, with varying levels of difficulty.  Overall, a good logic game worth trying as a FAOTD.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ Free (today)<br />+ Original<br />+ Easy to Understand (it has a tutorial)<br />+ Smooth UI<br />+ Decent Graphics<br />+ Varying Levels of Difficulty<br />+ No Advertisements<br />+ No IAPS<br />+ Only One Permission<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Some of the Harder Levels Encourage Guessing<br />- Little Replay Value<br /><br />Bottom Line:  I would definitely try this app as a FAOTD, I might have even bought it for $1.99.  An original, interesting spin on minefield, this is, in my opinion, a good logic puzzle.
B00D8CSVLW|5.0|Really enjoyed this book, excellent read.  The storyline takes many twists and I couldn't put the book down! Old school Grisham!
B00ER23V1W|5.0|Great soundtrack. Brings the tension of the film into its sound.  Middle tracks are a little slow but show depth. Definitely worth adding to our collection.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved it. Excellent show. I missed the season on television and was able to catch up on season 3 with the videos.

0345529057|5.0|Amanda and I ordered this for her boyfriend, Brian, for his birthday.  He was absolutely thrilled when he got home from work and found the box of books on his porch!
0385537131|4.0|Grisham is certainly a good author.  He writes well.  I especially like his description of lawyers as complete scumbags.  They are.  Even  the hero is excited at the beginning about how much money he can suck out of a prolonged will dispute, though he tended to emphasize this less as the story went on-probably to make his character more compassionate.<br /><br />I also do not have a problem with the story of the massacre from 1930.  Quite possibly things like that could have happened back then.<br /><br />What I do have a problem with is the placement of this story in 1989.  Maybe the mid-50s would have worked, but that is too far in the past to cement interest.  And if Grisham put the story in the present, people, at least thinking people, would say how ridiculous it is that the Klan is active and burning down people's houses and how racist and discriminatory society is.  Grisham puts it in 1989 and hopes people's memories aren't very long.<br /><br />The Klan was a joke by 1970, if not before.  Its power to intimidate had long since passed.  As for the blatant discrimination depicted in this novel, that didn't exist as such in 1989.  If anything, by that time &#34;affirmative action&#34; had already institutionalized reverse discriminition.  I served on a medical school admissions committee in the mid-80s and remember us being told that we had to accept at least one of two minority  applicants with &#34;C&#34; averages and relatively poor test scores at the same time we were rejecting white students with &#34;A&#34; averages.  To say that the type of institutionalized racism depicted in this novel was occurring in the late 80's is just plain wrong.<br /><br />It's a good story, but the setting should have been 30 years earlier.  It is an anachronism.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|Too dry. .. Only a few minutes of DiCaprio ! !  He has a very small part in this movie .  Expected to see him in a staring roll .
B004T340QY|5.0|Very funny movie.  There isn't a dull scene in the movie.  George Clooney and the rest of gang are excellent!
B002OMZTSK|4.0|This was a really good book, my only complaint is that I wish it would have been longer. Very well written and good at showing how things are for a lot of lgbt youth in high school. I wish I had found out about its book while I was in high school. I would definitely recommend this.

014241543X|3.0|As a 28-year old male, I have a hard time thinking this book is for me. But! the general theme of death and dying should personally resonate to any reader, and unfortunate to that goal, this book comes up short in a number of ways: I felt it to be quite plot driven rather than emotion stirring, and the flashbacks did little to add to my understanding of Mias current situation and &#34;decision&#34;, other than to reinforce an idea that your family can extend to include your friends and relationships. Heartfelt, but this was said through plot more than expressed through internal emotions and feelings, which is the bar a book of this nature must overcome and generate empathy out of me.<br /><br />For a 17-year old girl, while I can't empathize, the obsession with Adam the boyfriend (Mr Cliche punk bad boy with a heart) was frustrating in light of her limited discussion as to the grief she should be reflecting on as to her family. The problem, though, with writing as a seventeen year old girl narrator, is that you are dumbing down the richness of emotional expression to not be very deep or insightful. &#34;My leaving would suck for her, but she'll deal...&#34; (P. 218). Too much time was spent in past stories that I didn't feel add to our insights of Mia's decision. &#34;Will she break up or won't they?&#34; is too cliche to make this story original. More should have been spent on Mia's internal process of wrestling with the titular question: Should she stay? Instead, the general theme of the book is &#34;Where She's Been.&#34; I was surprised at the time focused on where her boyfriend is rather than what should have consumed much more text regarding how she is coping with the loss of everyone in her immediate family. Seriously! She mentions a couple times teddy is gone, but not much more.<br /><br />I would instead recommend john greens books looking for Alaska or the fault in out stars, which address the teenage grief and relationship issues genre with a much more insightful, engaging and emotionally connecting presentation.<br /><br />To her credit, this book does have it's moments: I enjoyed the music metaphor, and the whispers of Gramps and Adam at Mia's bedside were genuine and moving. 2.5 stars.
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|AWFUL movie!!!!  They should have stopped after the first movie.  All this movie did was show the murder of innocent animals (which is never funny under any circumstances unless you are clinically psychotic) and the group of guys who were hilarious in the first movie turn into mean and crazy morons during a bad and predictable plot.  A complete waste of time and money in my opinion.
B008MWBY6W|4.0|  Much higher quality than the price suggests.  Very well-designed, built, and organized.  The only concern I have is the plastic hardware—strap rings and clips and such, where metal would have been more appropriate.  I note some other reviewers have had problems with these breaking; but so far, I've had no problem with them.  I may some time obtain and install proper metal parts in place of the cheap plastic ones.<br /><br />  Other than the inappropriate use of plastic hardware instead of metal, I am quite impressed with the quality of the materials and construction used in this case.  One would expect to pay quite a bit more for a case of this size and quality.

B000QCS8TW|3.0|It is perfectly fine for a summer read. It is not, however, amazingly engrossing. It is also a little convoluted. If you need a long read (airport, sick, or just want  a long read), this certainly is adequate. I liked that it was far less on Kindle than paperback.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|it's a great book. reminded me a little of pretty woman. I'd recommend. however if you don't like sex scenes that are explicit y poo u might want to reconsider.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a fun and challenging game but I don't like having to beg friends for tickets or have to buy them. I would rather just play. that makes it frustrating.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|Just finished Dust. It was fabulous! We see more of the characters' personalities than we have in a while, very refreshing. Can't wait for the next one already!
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|007 still misses the point, I think, of the original intent of 007, but it wasn't horrible.  No Q gadgets, not even a scene where 007 is in bed with a woman, everything cloaked with a sense of doom.  Yea, missing the point, but then again, in today's world isn't most of entertainment.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|While you know that the hero will win, its's is all in how. Compelling well written, true to life characters with flaws. A great read and follow-up to A Time to Kill.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is totally awesome! I strongly recommend anyone who loves the minions as much as I do to get this app.
B001KZG99A|2.0|This film sucks. It has too many lies. They are trying to PUSH their war agenda pretending that there is an actual war in Afghanistan.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Love this movie. Not really a Christmas classic, but definitely a Lampoon's movie to remember. Of course Chevy makes the movie, but the rest of the cast is a fitting bunch. If you have never seen this movie then you are missing out on a great one.
B00G9U7NEQ|4.0|This movie is pretty cool. It does a great job of showing you that college is a big lie and also a good time. There is no drug use, so that's my biggest criticism.
0374530718|5.0|Good price. Recommended for all my friends.<br />This site is easy to used. I like it. Thank you so much.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|in my mind this is a great app with the ability to take your own or make your own picks is really great even thou it has some minor problems like something went wrong when likeing or posting a comment it kinda gets a bit agraviting but I think that they will fix that in the future.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|I read this book in record time. I found the writing style fast-paced and enjoyed a rich vocabulary. The story itself was interesting and confirmed what I've heard and seen before re Chinese mothers. Like with everything else there has to be something good yo take from this story and I would agree that western parents often let their children give up too easily and respect off others and parents should be paramount in every household. The book is recommended for anyone who is not too sensitive about raising children. It was a good read, I would recommend it.
0385537131|5.0|I've read all of Grisham's books and this was definitely one of his best.  I am a fast reader and as I could barely put it down, I read it in 2 and a half days.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys his books.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|This is the best male POV book I've read! You will absolutely fall in love with Drew Evans! CANNOT wait for the next book to be released!!!
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|I enjoyed the movie immensely and watched it 2 times.  I was very pleased how it dealt with addictions and the fact that we can find ourselves in a situation where the elements are out of our control, however, they become expanded based on the choices that we make.  Denzel is an excellent actor and his acting ability showed well in this movie.<br /><br />I loved the dynamics that existed between him and ALL the other cast members, family, friends and his new girlfriend.  I also liked the fact that he realized that life was not life in the state that he was in and at some point, he could no longer be &#34;enabled&#34; and as a result lost the favor of ALL THOSE who truly knew him based on his addictions.<br /><br />I like the fact that it showed he tried to change, but could not until an external situation brought him to the point of change and that he could NOT LIE ANYMORE.<br /><br />Great FILM and GREAT ACTING.  This is a film that makes you think of it long after the credits stop rolling.<br />-c. solutions 11/15/13

B000JQU1VS|3.0|Just a group of old classics.  If you like Sherlock Holmes, you'll enjoy this as well.  Always well-written as usual.
B0091W7K6K|5.0|Steve McQueen playing the tough cop. The chase scene is likely the best ever filmed, even though the technology has now been surpassed, the reality shines. If you watch closely there is some trickery, but the overall effect is still tops. The audio is fantastic too.
0316219266|5.0|An excellently written book. It was gripping and revealing at the same time. I would rate this just next to Roger Lowenstein's \\"Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist\\". ([[ASIN:0812979273 Buffett The Making American Capitalist]]
B00F35B8F8|1.0|FIRST&#62;&#62;&#62; I LOVE STAR TREK!  Even the bad ones I've enjoyed..until this one.  It was just stupid in so many places!  After the first movie which was a wonderful reboot..this was terrible.  Horrible plot, bad acting, terrible mistakes in story line...  BAD bad bad!!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|The whole book, not just the ending, was a total let down to the the series.  I will always think of this as a two-book series.
B008J34466|5.0|Come on, it's Pink. She's at her best and that says a lot! Great songs, highly recommend. She is amazing.
0739302752|3.0|This is a good book but I would buy the bridged version of this if you can, otherwise you'll be bored beyond belief.  Not much substance, but lots of boring talk
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|A true classic that I had not read in decades. I forgot so much of the story it was like a first reading.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|A nice history lesson of the events surrounding WWI,with wonderful characters. Can't wait for the next book to come out.
B00FFVB2DI|5.0|Funny and believable! This season has good continuing character development and I'm glad to see more realistic plots (not so many &#34;Lucy & Ethel&#34; scenarios).
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|The greatest music, played by the greatest musicians - The Swampers! This is a must see video for anyone who loves good music.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Great book.  It gave me great insight into what life is like in a women's prison.  Not what I expected.  Should be required reading for the hardliners who want to fill the prisons with nonviolent drug offenders.
B00129H7VS|5.0|This was a great series and was purchased as a gift for someone who really enjoys war history.  It is well-acted and is great viewing on a rainy or snowy weekend.  Great stories--the men in your life would enjoy this.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I'd rate this 4.5 stars.<br /><br />Wow, I may be a little late to the party on this book, but I'm really glad I read it. This is the perfect example of a thought-provoking beach read--it grips you immediately, keeps you totally fascinated, and the plot is almost completely believable, but you won't feel embarrassed reading it, because it's well-written.<br /><br />Cecilia Fitzpatrick is the very definition of an overachieving wife and mother. Her house is spotless and organized to the hilt, she's the president of the Parents & Friends association at her daughters' school, she has a successful business on the side, and is the first to participate, greet, and help, in every situation. With three (reasonably) well-behaved daughters, and a (somewhat) perfect marriage to handsome and successful John-Paul, she certainly appears to have it all.<br /><br />Then one morning she finds a envelope addressed in her husband's hand, to her, which says it should only be opened in the event of his death. And as she ponders what could be in this letter, she starts realizing that things with John-Paul haven't been as solid as usual. Her daughters mention some odd behavior, and then there's the fact that they haven't had sex in quite some time. Should she read the letter or adhere to his wishes and put it away?<br /><br />Meanwhile, Tess has just found out that her husband and her cousin--her co-workers and two closest friends in the world--have fallen in love. She flees her Melbourne home with their young son, and retreats to her mother's house in Sydney to figure her life out. This solution is complicated by the reappearance of an old boyfriend and the fact that her husband and cousin won't stop calling her to explain.<br /><br />Rachel has been living her life mourning her daughter, Janie, who was mysteriously murdered when she was younger. Some 20 years after Janie's death, she still holds a grudge against who she thinks the killer was. The only thing that brightens her days is her time with her young grandson, but Rachel's son has just mentioned that he is moving his family to New York.<br /><br />Cecilia, Tess, and Rachel know each other (or know of each other) peripherally, but their lives will suddenly connect in ways they have never expected. They will discover truths they never knew, and find themselves making sacrifices they never considered. The Husband's Secret shows that you never know everything you think you do about those you love, and how secrets almost always have a way of hurting others.<br /><br />I thought this was a completely compelling read from start to finish, and I flew through the book very quickly. Sure, it's a little melodramatic, but not in a bad way--the main characters have some pretty major issues to deal with. Liane Moriarty is a great storyteller, and even if certain strands of the plot are predictable, they don't take away from the book's appeal. I really enjoyed this.
B005VPRETE|3.0|I only chose &#34;okay&#34; because I could not purchase just the cat which was all I needed and it was a greater expense than what I wanted to pay.  However, I am sure someone will have fun putting it together as I enjoyed putting the &#34;Downtown Bakery&#34; together myself!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy that i can now get it on my kindle fire. More fun on larger screen<br />This is my favorite game
B0055S348W|5.0|Very user-friendly and easy to use. This comes up as one of the options when I click on the share icon. Very easy-to-use
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Better than I thought it would be.  This book was published at the right time, with the 50th anniversary of Kennedy's assassination this year.
8867320793|4.0|Deffenitly a top class notebook the embossing just adds some additionall class to the overall item in my opinion.  Tho I could do without the crude sketches in the first few pages as I wanted the notebook completly empty for my own works but that can be wripped out I suppose so I didnt take it in account when rating this edition.<br /><br />Now if your wondering why I gave it 4 stars, well while the book is very well put together the pages are very thin i was hoping to be able to write with my new fountain pen in the book but almost all thick ink bleeds through. Making the back page illegible if u attempt to write something on it.
B0007939NO|3.0|Kinda disappointing.  Ballet just did not work and seemed much too contrived and artsy-phartsy for a cute, fun musical.  Music was good, as was the acting and story...but the dance numbers did not work well or complement the musical.
B00ANY7V8M|5.0|Needed the black and white cat for a project I was working on.  Luckily, this item was not very expensive.
B00CATONCA|5.0|I bought mine and still have it in the box.<br />The Walking Dead is one of the best shows on television, so I believe it was a great investment.<br />One day, it will be worth a lot more than it cost

B0070YDOT8|1.0|I've been a Big Fish customer for many years. This new game is very expensive to play. The chips don't last very long because most pulls don't result in even getting your bet back, let alone make any extra chips. The cheapest slot to play is 45 chips to play all nine lines. Free chips on average without a purchase are 500 chips every half hour. That doesn't last and you stand no chance of winning the jackpot because that requires a max bet...or 450 chips a pull. The most expensive game is Candy Crane, which has a minimum bet of 56,000 chips to play all 9 lines. It offers free spins that seldom result in much of a &#34;profit&#34; of chips. People have reported spending hundreds of dollars a month in chip purchases..... If you've ever had a gambling problem, this &#34;fun game&#34; will be trouble for you, because the games are fun to play. I'm very disappointed in Big Fish for this offering, and I won't be buying anymore chips.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I am so intrigued with all the colorful characters, I truly hope they all made it into the second story!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game, but only gave it 4 stars because I wish you got more than 4 lives, especially when you pay for them.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|This book completely lost momentum for me, and I'm having trouble even wanting to pick it up and finish it.  The story feels almost tedious at this point.  After the first two books, I am pretty disappointed with this one.
B000PKX2KA|3.0|Would be great if it would work with Windows 7. It's a shame that it's no longer supported. I love it with Windows XP
B00A8ECU24|1.0|The cute factor of this game is high, but after you've bought all of the ponies you can with the coins you earn in the game, there is nowhere to go. The game becomes pointless because there's nothing left to try to save for or do. You have to spend real money to progress further.<br /><br />As a child of parent who is unwilling to spend real money on fake video game \\"belongings,\\" my kid has lost interest in and stopped playing this game because you can only get so far without using money.<br /><br />The makers of this game could easily remedy this problem by offering more ponies, buildings, and decorations buyable with the gold coins earned within the game, but they are quite obviously trying to get parents' cash by making it impossible to move forward without our money.<br /><br />If you decide to get this game for your Kindle Fire, be sure to set up parental controls to require a password for purchases so your kiddo can't spend your money. And know that unless you are willing to spend your money on animated videogame ponies, this game will eventually disappoint your child when they reach the point at which they can go no further without mom and dad's credit card.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I had this on my prime movies repertory for a year and two months, but I never cared to watch it because it was was a tiny photograph and  I thought It was acted by teenagers. Until about a month ago when I decided to see what was that all about. And I watched it. The rest is history I couldn't believe how excellently acted it was and how everything else pertaining to the film was terrific. I was hooked. You can read my review of Sherlock Season 2. What else can I say, it's a marvelous series. Watch it!
B007T8BYWE|5.0|I have always loved puzzles but never heard of these until trying this one. So much fun. Will find more.
B00CZ7OC46|5.0|A great book with very useful insights for both the employer as well as the employee starting remote work. Like Rework I really like the light readable chapters in the book.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Very interesting book. I like the way it is written. It shows that it was not written by a westerner. A way of knowing other cultures. Easy to read
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|The book was good but not up to Tom Clancy's usual standards.  Maybe it was due to the fact that he had a co-writer.  The same was true for Dead or Alive.  Looking forward to the next Jack Ryan book
0783232039|5.0|because I love the movie it was great, also the movie was in excellent condition when I received it in the post so well done Amazon.
B0081336FO|5.0|This is a very interesting twist on the original SH. I was afraid it's being so modern I would really end up hating it. But I was pleasantly surprised and pleased by the degree of inventiveness and originality of the plots. The acting is fantastic! B. Cumberbatch  presents SH as the genius on the borderline of brilliant insanity. Martin Freeman plays a somewhat introspective Dr. Watson, perhaps because he has experienced the horrors of the Afghanistan war. But they fit like hand and glove and make a handsome pair of sleuths. Great show.! Oh and the music is tops.
B00C5R8364|4.0|Exciting and very topical for these times. With NSA surveillance and intelligence gathering in Middle East it poses some interesting ethical and moral dilemmas.
B000QXDED6|5.0|The movie is very well done.<br />It helps to give me some idea od what went on historically.<br />The acting is very good and the story line is great.<br />I have watch the movie over couple of times and see something new each time.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|This was a good book but the first two are so much better that I was sad and disappointed.. When the chapters changed I couldn't  tell who was Tobias and who was Tris, until someone said their names, or it talked out about this or Tobias in 3rd person through the narrators eyes. :/ and it in the compound outside of the city, it was boring and just drug on...the book was still good, just disappointed me and wasn't up to the high standards I set for it.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|because you could not put it down that to me is the sign of a good book very exciting read
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Some puzzles are really hard. But that's what I love so much about it. It is a lot more fun than I expected it to be.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|THE authoritative documentary of WWII.  If you know nothing about WWII then this series will teach you more, faster, and in a more interesting way, than any other way to learn about the greatest conflict ever.  Because this was made in the 1970's many of the commanders were still alive to be interviewed on camera.  It is interesting to hear their perspective, even when they are justifying their own errors. Sir Brian Horrocks, Lord Mountbatten, Sir Arthur (Bomber) Harris are examples of hearing from the men who were in on some of the biggest decisions.  Interviewing German and Japanese officers and soldiers was a controversial idea when this was made -but hearing the 'other side' is incredible. The interview with Commander Genda, the officer who actually planned the Pearl Harbor attack, is amazing.  This also includes 2 separate films. One, Hitler's secretary provides the insights of a normal woman into the bizarre world of Der Fuhrer. The second, on the Holocaust, is the most accurate and comprehensive documentary I have ever seen on that terrible event.  Warning: actual footage shot by Nazi soldiers is used showing people being killed.  But if you know anyone tempted to think that the Holocaust was not real - this presentation, using German footage, will show just how real, and how terrible, it was.
B00FEMJF6O|2.0|I have been playing this for 3 weeks and I was loving it..until it updated last night and now won't load. I have submitted requests for help to no avail. Slightly embarrassed by how much actual money has been spent, so I really HATE to lose my progress! Don't waste your time if you want to actually be able to keep playing!
B00DW36G32|3.0|I expected much better action from those two. Not a bad movie but predictable and travoltas accent was annoying..not very good
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|Very, very fun i really love this game you can fight other bots customise your bot and get mony and coins
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game . I just can not get enough of this game. I would recommend this game. So happy I found it.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I liked it, it is a good story.  It is a typical John Grisham tale using his background as a Mississippi lawyer.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I could not put this book down. The Shining has always been a favorite of mine and Stephen King did this sequel justice! I could not put it down.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Very well done, me and my wife have watched every episode so far, and are waiting for the next season to come out. The HD quality is excellent.
B00F91SCXC|2.0|not worth watching. Not much of a plot and was shocked at the performance. Expected much better. disapointment..don't waste your time
B00GD9F59S|5.0|You shouldn't scare people like that. I seriously cried because I thought it was over. I loved this book I couldn't stop reading it. There was heartbreak, tragedies, humour, and everything you need to get me hooked with this book. You have got to be wrong in the head not to read this book.
B00FAXLCWW|5.0|Great sound. Listening is like the old myth of eating Chinese food. After you listen to the album you are hungry to hear it again.
B009E3EY38|4.0|This is a nice album, and probably without a doubt the last time Led Zep will play together.  For that reason alone, it's probably a must-have.  Sound quality is excellent and, as my son said, &#34;It's nice to hear Led Zeppelin with some bass&#34; which is an obvious reference to all the less-than-stellar recordings of the past.  Very decent album. If you are a Zep fan, go for it.
1449410243|5.0|Very funny book! It also comes with a poster that we hung on our wall of various ways your cat is plotting to kill you.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|works great easy to set up I watch net flix from my cell phone. It has many uses and works great. don't know what I would do with out it.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Fun and addictive. Hard to put down. Great for passing the time while waiting for someone or something. This game makes me laugh when I hear the sounds the birds and pigs make. Too funny.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|Much like the other games, it can't be played offline and I find that irritating.  For the most part, it's enjoyable if you have an internet connection.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this is a fun game to play . I could play for hours. but I only play til I run out of lives
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I really wish I could say this app worked great but it did NOT work at all! I know I can just go on the internet and view youtube but the point of an app is to remove that extra step.  This app crashed as soon as i tried it.  Everytime! After a few minutes of trying to use it I deleted it.  Don't bother downloading the app.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Having read 100s of these types of books. This is the best. You can actually feel what it is like - good to read while watching the series, The Pacific.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I read all three Hunger Games books in a week in March 2012. My oldest son's birth in 2010 seriously cut into my time for reading, and parenthood was, initially, an unexpectedly emotional rollercoaster, so while I'd read the book jacket of The Hunger Games about a dozen times before I finally took the plunge, it stayed in my TBR pile a long time because the subject matter seemed too heavy for my then-state of mind.<br /><br />I enjoyed the first book more than any of the others. I found Katniss to be utterly relatable as a character, despite the fact that her universe is blessedly very far removed from my own. Her survival instinct and sometimes brutal (almost heartless) practicality made her difficult to like, but she resonated with me. Peeta was, throughout the trilogy, a bit too good to be true, but thankfully not at all Eddie Haskell-ish as are so many male romantic leads. (Perhaps I should say Edward Cullen-ish? He is probably the Eddie Haskell of the new century.) To call the story 'gripping' would be a massive understatement. Unlike Twilight, where one can skip hundreds of pages and pick up more or less where one left off, every page of every chapter of The Hunger Games seems to bring a new twist which the reader won't want to miss.<br /><br />I did not like Catching Fire as well as book 1, but liked it better than Mockingjay (book 3). In this second installment, Katniss grew into her role as the human tinder that sparked a revolution -- this time not by accident, but by reasoned decision. Also, Peeta-the-Perfect began to look less inevitable as Katniss's better half as her childhood hunting partner Gale also vied for her affections.<br /><br />Perhaps it is my fault for reading the whole series in a week, but Mockingjay was my least favorite of the Hunger Games trilogy. Throughout all three books, horrifically bad things happen to the main characters with unrelenting frequency, and some of the worst tragedies happen in the last half of the last book. By the end, I was emotionally drained and, frankly, not having fun anymore, but of course I had to keep reading to see how the series ended.<br /><br />I give Suzanne Collins a lot of credit for her spot-on understanding of the human psyche's response to trauma. By the end of the series, Katniss is as numb and damaged as so many of the domestic violence victims I work with, which made me glad that this book ended, not with a happily-ever-after (which would have been hard to swallow) but just respite from her trials, which is the best Katniss can hope for.<br /><br />The Hunger Games: 4.5 stars<br />Catching Fire: 3 stars<br />Mockingjay: 2.5 starsend, I was emotionally drained and, frankly, not having fun anymore, but of course I had to keep reading to see how the series ended.<br /><br />I give Suzanne Collins a lot of credit for her spot-on understanding of the human psyche's response to trauma.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is addictive and lots of fun, once you get past the starter levels. The ads are a bit annoying, but are pretty minimal for a free game.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Loved the relationship between Dan and Abra and their interesting connection.  They dynamic within her family was well done, parents dealing with a child with &#34;special&#34; abilities.  Not unlike dealing with an autistic or special needs child I imagine...  Although Dan didn't have any family left he cobbled together one that meant a lot to him and gave him peace.  Not too predictable either which was good.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I think it very good for me because I have to vet up early in the morning each day and would like to know what the degrees is outside and what happenings about the weather is going on before going outside.
0143039431|5.0|A book I chose to read for english. Havent really made a dent in it yet. So far it seems interesting.
B003EY7IRC|4.0|As I noted with Faefever and Dreamfever, it becomes increasingly difficult to review the Fever books as the series goes on, because the plot just builds and builds until anything I could say about what happens is a spoiler.<br /><br />So here's what I will say. I was totally caught up in the ride. I read the whole series in a week. I gave up sleep, I cheated work, I didn't return calls, I didn't pay enough attention to my wife and kids. I stole every spare minute I could from the rest of my life to ride the Fever ride, and it was fun, it was breathless, it was exhilarating. And as long as I don't think very deeply or critically, it was deeply satisfying.<br /><br />In Shadowfever, Karen Marie Moning tied up the many, many loose ends from the previous installments in ways that were unexpected and exciting. There are plot twists that will make you slap yourself upside the head in delicious epiphany. It will seem like a chorus of angels will sing in your head, and all will seem brilliant and clear and perfect in that moment of oh-my-god-i-FINALLY-get-it-now. That's an undeniably good, satisfying feeling, and I enjoyed--really enjoyed--Shadowfever for giving me that.<br /><br />However, now that I have finished the series, I have some real complaints. Apart from Mac and Dani, there are NO positive depictions of women in the entire Fever series, which really ticks me off. I also don't like the sexualized violence, manipulative dynamic between Mac and Barrons. And I find Mac to be an untrustworthy and sometimes annoying narrator.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This puzzle is very challenging.  Without patience you will give up, but for those with that trait will have fun
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|This will be a gift to my son who is a huge fan of Legos and Back to the Future.  I am very happy with the purchase.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|I just got the controller the other day and am more than pleased with this product. The controller itself is authentic JDM. Fresh out of the box it has a really good and solid feel too it. The plastic is textured nicely so that it's comfortable in hand, and needless to say it looks awesome in white. The only thing missing is purple box lettering... because this thing is epic.<br /><br />So glad I didn't go with a used or third party from ebay, because that's what I was looking at before I found this. New is always best.

B005OCFHHK|1.0|This product is advertised with a 1.77 aspect ratio.  The product I received had a 2.4 aspect ratio.  This results in a black band across the top and bottom of the screen.  I returned the product.

B00BWQW73E|5.0|An insightful, detailed and eye-opening look into Amazon's beginnings. Ultimately, this is a book about the Amazon culture, which is often gritty and somewhat alarming.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Great game. Has a Gore option, several guns, armor, some missions coincide with others, and there are even attachments and throwing knives! Best game I have ever gotten. Thanks Gameloft!

B00BAXFECK|5.0|The plot of this book is so unusual and the characters so vivid with well-researched details and well written prose, I can't praise it enough. I have to say that I read the author's other books including her much-heralded debut, The Secret History but this book is really her magnum opus. I can't recall ever reading such beautiful descriptions of people, places, and objects.<br /><br />At a very young age, Theo Decker comes into possession of a rare painting, a masterpiece, under calamitous circumstances with lasting effects. This event defines his future. The people it brings into his orbit -- such as his surrogate family, his estranged father, a description-defying best friend, and an adoptive mentor -- are a rollicking ride through existential territory.<br /><br />Donna Tartt is a master storyteller. The words that flow from her form a masterpiece on par with the rare work that is the book's title.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|Illogical Story, but has some funny moments. Effects are overdone, and a lot of it makes no sense. Worse than the previous two, especially the first movie.
B00F3VOL38|5.0|There are very few live documents of The Beatles on CD during their early years. \\"On Air-Live at the BBC Volume 2\\" released 14 years after \\"Volume 1\\", continue the documentation of the band performing a mixture of their own songs, covers they did on their albums and some songs they never did anywhere else making this an essential document for Beatles fans.<br /><br />The earliest recordings have little to no overdubs as the BBC wasn't set up really to do them at the time. These performances are pretty raw but professional capturing a little bit of what they must have sounded like at the time live. Since many of these were done before they broke in America, these performances will be of special interest to American Beatles fans who never had the oppportunity to hear the original BBC performances.<br /><br />The sound is as good as could be expected considering that the sources vary; some of the performances are taken from original surviving BBC tapes, some from overseas acetates that survived after the original recordings were destroyed in a cost savings move from the BBC, bootlegs and, in a few instances, over the air amateur recordings. There is little to no noise reduction used (it was used quite heavily on the original CD release of Volume 1--the remaster of Volume 1 features little to no noise reduction as well and better edits). Keep in mind the variety of sources, the fact that these were recorded 50 years ago and the recording conditions at the time and you'll have no issue with this set (well, except that MORE of the recordings aren't forthcoming). Where possible the indexing<br />keeps the spoken bits separate from the music for those that just want the performances and not the comments from the host or the band.<br /><br />Some  recordings are live in front of audience and some are presented here before they appeared on official Beatles releases such as \\"Words of Love\\" which had yet to be recorded for \\"Beatles for Sale\\".<br /><br />The excellent, heavy paper gloosy booklet documents the sessions, has a nice introduction from Paul McCartney and a bit of history on the recordings. The CDs are housed in a trifold glossy sleeve and the CDs slide out of the cardboard so you may want to move these to plastic CD holders if that's going to bug you.<br /><br />I should note that these recordings along with ALL the surviving BBC Recordings have been available (and still are online) in a 12 disc set (as bootlegs or \\"gray\\" market releases)  for the past couple of years so these offical recordings just make it easier for fans to pick them up if you aren't internet savvy enough or want hard copy of these performances. My only complaint is that (as of this writing) Apple has no intention of doing a volume 3 (claiming that they picked the cream of the crop--oh really? Then where are the stellar performances for \\"Dream Baby\\" and other songs that are every bit the equal of these?) which is frustrating for fans that want this on vinyl or CD in the best quality possible. That, however, is a side note--what we DO get here is terrific.<br /><br />Among the highlights are Paul covering \\"Lucille\\", John's \\"There's a Place\\" (a rare live recorded outing for this early Lennon classic), a brilliant \\"Words of Love\\", \\"Glad All Over\\" (George does the vocal on this cover song by his beloved Carl Perkins, a killer version of \\"Memphis Tennessee\\" by John's favorite artist (aside from Elvis) Chuck Berry and Ringo does a killer version of \\"Boys\\".<br /><br />For Beatles fans this release is essential and Apple has done a terrific job of preparing this for release. I would suggest that they may want to reconsider their decision not to do a volume 3 or 4.er gloosy booklet documents the sessions, has a nice introduction from Paul McCartney and a bit of history on the recordings.

B00F4BJ4M0|5.0|When \\"Live at The BBC\\" was released back in 1994, it was the first time that the BBC archive had been tapped for these unique releases aside from the various bootleg releases (going back as early as the mid-1970's as John Lennon bought one and gave it to Paul thinking it was their Decca auditions). What's fun and fascinating to hear on \\"Live at the BBC\\" are the various covers the band did of favorites from their record collection that they never performed anywhere else. It's also fun to hear the band in its early stages bristling with energy and with decent (mono) sound quality.<br /><br />This remaster is different from the 1994 original release in a number of ways. These recordings have been remastered from scratch without the overuse of noise reduction, various pops and clicks removed (since many of these are drawn from a variety of sources including acetates pressed for overseas broadcast, the few original tapes that exist and, in a few cases, from amateur recordings made off of the radio back in the day when other sources didn't exist) and, in a handful of cases, improved source tapes/acetates that improve the sound. Having said all of that, these releases don't show a huge improvement in sound quality--there is only so much you can do with 50 year old mono tapes and vinyl pressings--but the sound quality improvement will be important to hardcore Beatles fans.<br /><br />A couple of tracks (\\"Soldier of Love\\" and \\"I Forgot to Remember\\" are the only two I could identify but there may be some others with minor tweaking) are speed corrected as well as they were running slightly too fast.<br /><br />The packaging is different for this reissue compared to the original 1994 CD release. These are presesnted in a mini cardboard sleeve with each disc tucked into one portion of the packaging. The booklet occupies the third slot and it is an excellent one that provides recording details, an essay on the album and a series of excellent photos from the sessions as well.<br /><br />The highlights here include \\"That's Alright Mama\\" (a killer cover of an Elvis classic), \\"A Shot of Rhythm and Blues\\", \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\", \\"Things We Said Today\\", \\"I'm a Loser\\", \\"Ticket to Ride\\", \\"Honey Don't\\" (with John on lead vocal) and \\"Slow Down\\". There are, of course, many others. The talking where possible has been indexed separately. For those that wanted \\"Lend Me Your Comb\\" which was on the first disc of \\"Anthology\\", that does show up on Volume 2 of this set as do two of the three tracks that were exclusive to the original CD single from 1994 (\\"I'll Follow the Sun\\" and \\"Boys\\" with only \\"Devil in Her Heart\\" MIA on that or this set).<br /><br />Highly recommended for Beatles fans.<br /><br />Is this worth the upgrade? That really depends on how important the sound of this release is to you. If the original 1994 CD sounds perfectly fine to you, then the difference may not be that noticeable to you. I personally was unhappy with the overuse of noise reduction on the original which often made the sound of these mono recordings even more muddy. The improvement in sound is marginal by comparison to many releases but for those who disliked certain elements of the original release or who wanted improved sources for the handful of tracks here, this will be essential.><br />The highlights here include \\"That's Alright Mama\\" (a killer cover of an Elvis classic), \\"A Shot of Rhythm and Blues\\", \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\", \\"Things We Said Today\\", \\"I'm a Loser\\", \\"Ticket to Ride\\", \\"Honey Don't\\" (with John on lead vocal) and \\"Slow Down\\".

B00BAXFECK|5.0|A wonderful tale, a deep consideration of the tragedy it is to be human and why we need/desire/love art. What makes great books great: I cared about and suffered with the characters and wanted to know what would happen next.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is hands down one of the BEST books I have ever read!  I felt so connected to the characters that I actually cared what was going to happen to each one of them.  I found myself thinking about the book throughout the day each time I put it down.

A few minutes each night and new words come easily.  Both kids loved the fact<br />that they could recognize each item.
B00499BTS0|5.0|Downloaded the Kindle version, loved every word! Now my husband is reading it. If you read no other Keith Richards biography, read this one.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast is the best $35 you'll ever spend on ANY electronic gadget. Ever. Google Play Music, Google Movies & TV, YouTube and Netflix all stream flawlessly to your TV from your phone or laptop. This device delivers absolutely everything Google promises and performs well above my expectations for such an inexpensive device. Every TV should have this amazing device plugged into it. Setup is a breeze and you will not be disappointed. Chromecast is a highly recommended addition to any home theater system.

B0000AUHOH|5.0|Sadly enough the reviews on Amazon are not for this version of the movie at all.  I over rated it to try and compensate for this usual oversight.  I would give the Movie 4 stars based on the redone version.  It really isn't accurate to use two separate versions of a film as the same on this site.  I am reviewing the Director's cut.  It is very much improved over the original, and maybe the best redo of the series.  I say maybe, because The Original Motion Picture was also a huge upgrade.  At least this film now fits in very well, and is of the quality, that we had from the other 5 films.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Amazing I love this - it  works like a charm all the time.<br /><br />I've never had a problem with this app unlike many others.
B0045HCJKS|4.0|It's a classic,  aged gracefully &  good for most everyone.  It's old fashioned effects require a bit of imagination, but still wonderful.  Wonder if the creators of the movie imagined how close we might get to making this movie a truism in their lifetimes?
B005O7PXNS|5.0|The relationship between Castle and Beckett has finally blossomed and their dedication to find Beckett's mother's killer is coming to a climax. Fun, drama and a well oiled cast. The new Captain is a great addition and we are getting to know the personal life of the cast members.

B00FEHXCIG|3.0|While I much preferred the first two Iron Man movies, Iron Man 3 left me wanting just more of a good superhero action flick.  The first Iron Man is still my favorite.  There's more of a story to tell; more of a &#34;logical&#34; development of the character.  Iron Man 3 isn't a bad movie by any means, but I just didn't buy the anxiety-ridden superhero bit and I don't feel Downey really sold that supposed anxiety in a very convincing way.  The smart little kid out of nowhere was not believable either.  I found him more annoying than anything.  I actually watched Iron Man 3 twice just to check my first impression, but found it wanting both times.  Downey's constant snappy wit grows very thin in this movie as well.  It seemed to fit the development of the character better in the first two than in this one.  I did enjoy Ben Kingsley, though.  What a hoot.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|The continuity and the diversity of the stories continue to keep me interested and I don't want to miss and episode. The relationship between Castle and Beckett brings a fershness to the show
B00FANXZL8|3.0|The graphic designer on this ruined the whole album for me in a way. I'm a graphic designer myself and the artwork on this and the original release are just atrocious. First off he ruined the &#34;Heroes&#34; cover, which was a beautiful design in the first place and didn't need to be messed with at all, period. Next his designs are very basic and boring, and don't get me wrong I love minimalistic designs. New Order's graphic designer Peter Saville uses plain text designs a lot and their brilliant. He uses text and white space really well, and makes an effective & powerful design, New Order's &#34;Substance&#34; is a perfect example. But this guy missed the idea, and it just looks like someone stamped the text & centered it with no artistic thought, very disappointing.
B008HK3TXK|4.0|love the look of the case, super cute and stylish! The description states \\"absolutely no slip\\", which is just not a true statement. In order to avoid a glare from overhead lights, it will not stand up in the position needed. It does well with other positions further apart. Overall, not a bad purchase.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|The quality of the Blu-ray is top notch.  I have no issue there.  The only gripe I have is with the menu system.  You cannot select by chapter or scene.  Almost every Blu-ray disc I have ever purchased has this feature.  Why would they choose to exclude it in this wonderful series.  I would rather have fewer interviews and such just to have had that feature included.  Having said that, would I buy this set again?  You bet!  Unless, of course, someone else came out with a better Blu-ray set that included the chapter select menu.
B003THHIEM|5.0|Only nine episodes but they are interesting because they introduce us to the cast and give us reasons to want more. Great ensemble and diverse story lines . Castle is my favorite TV Show
B0070Y60YE|5.0|its a very comfortable watch, it doesn't grate your skin. you could keep it on all day and night, the face is easily readable and it lights up in the dark so you can see the time! Last , but not least it was very affordable.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|As with all Grisham books, I regretted each time I had to leave my book and couldn't wait to return to it.

I loved them and needed to buy their Album this is a really great Album. Migraine, Holding on to you, Guns for Hands, and Fake you out are my absolute favorites but literally every song is great. Everyone should definitely give it a try.
B003TH14H4|5.0|The growing relationship between Beckett and Castle brings fun and a growing respect for one another. The team of Espisito and Ryan are mending into making the cast the best onTV.
B001CB8NQE|4.0|Stargate Atlantis Season 5 continued to be very enjoyable, with the familiar characters developed through new situations such as romance finally coming to one of the regular cast members, and lots of science fiction ideas and plot twists.  And the visual effects continued to be great.  The theme of the battle with the &#34;Wraith&#34; started to get a little tired and that is why I didn't rate it a 5.
B00GHJ6BJW|1.0|Must've had brain damage when I bought this.        Previious review : absolutely excellent. Trailing on the same feeling as her debut , Artpop makes a strong dance floor anthem to be enjoyed for years to come.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I enjoy the achievements part of the game. I love this version. The card action is very fast and I like the colors and cards. I highly recommend.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|At first I wasn't sure I was going to like this book. I couldn't place where it was going or what it was about. But after a couple of chapters I became entranced by the characters and engaged fully in the back story of Margaret's journey.<br />It has the feeling of a Gothic novel akin to the other very complicated protagonist, Miss Winters' favourite book \\"Jane Eyre\\".<br />I found it hard to put down and a great late night read. Looking forward to Miss Setterfield's new book.
B000P46QTA|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. A true work of art. The beauty of the film is in the character development and the actors who did such a fine job. This is a movie which you have to watch from start to end and you will be touched by it's conclusion.
B00A23MYCC|5.0|This is a great movie. I have watched it many, many times already, and it's great.  I could really do without the fight/chase scene at the end, I think that dragged on for too long.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Warning!Do not start this game!  Once you do, you are automatically addicted!  I am 70 yrs. Old and held off for over 6 months while the grandchildren and great-grandchildren played before I finally gave in to give it a try and now I am as addicted as they are!  But, what fun!!! Great for all ages!
B00CE3IC74|5.0|I ordered this to make my life a little more easier by changing the settings on my phone at work, at home and when I enter or leave the car.<br />The tags work like a charm.<br />I used \\"Trigger\\" app by \\"Egomotion Corp\\" from Play Store to help writing on to it.<br />[...]<br /><br />I had my doubts if this could  be used by multiple phones using a single tag. As long as one is using the same app, does the same. It was easy to write on to it. I placed one in my car to toggle bluetooth and turn off wireless. When home, used it to disable mobile data and connect to my wireless.<br /><br />Got 12 tags or different colors and I shared it with 2 other friends as well. I hardly needed 4 as of now.<br /><br />It would be more awesome if the tags were plain instead of having \\"TAP HERE\\" written but guess what I am knew it before purchasing it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Sycamore Row.  It was extremely hard to put down, especially the end of the trial.  The courtroom battles were terrific!  Great read and a must have for Grisham fans.
B003G4W49C|2.0|thoroughly enjoyable. being nerd that was picked in school with an iq that isolated me from classmates and most of peer group as well as well as veteran i found any basis in fact for most of basic premises of this novel. but a fun read of fantasy is not to be denigrated
B009DCOU9S|2.0|Although Magic Academy 2 features some nice puzzles and offers good value for the money in terms of the number of puzzles you get, this hidden object/adventure game is more annoying than enjoyable.<br /><br />The game has 23 levels each with two to five puzzles. Most of the puzzles are either hidden object or combining object puzzles, although there are a few oddball ones. Unfortunately, you can only save a game at the end of each levels, so unless you have the time to play a chapter all the way through, you wind up starting over.<br /><br />The biggest problem the game has is its overall story, featuring your character, a novice magician, on a quest to find a missing spell book and prevent something bad from happening. In each level, you meet a different character (usually a more senior magician) who assigns the tasks that must be completed. The characters appear in the middle of the screen and talk for a long time without saying anything interesting (they resemble Jib Jab cartoon characters). Soon, you will probably lose complete track (as I did) of the overlying story line and just be in a hurry to have them shut up so you can begin play.<br /><br />The game does offer an unlimited number of hints for the puzzles (there's a time delay for how often you can get a hint), but it also has some troublesome glitches. One of these is that when you combine objects, you can't just move one object on top of the other. Instead, there's a stagger, so the object has to be placed someplace nearby, resulting in a lot of guesswork before you can proceed.<br /><br />I downloaded this game as a FAOTD over the summer and finally finished it, so that will tell you something about the level of interest the game has. You do get plenty of puzzles for the money (if you pay for it), but you probably won't enjoy the game play very much.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|As engrossing as all the other Cousin's War novels.  Love all of her historical fiction.  I would definitely recommend it!
B0068MNO4S|5.0|Great movie for any Shakespeare fan! I had no idea this was even a theory, but it sure does make for some interesting and thought provoking conversations!
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|This would not work on my phone was very disappointed with this app. nothing more to say but it didn't work
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I really like that this game allows you to create and learn. It is fun to play when I need to relax and just want something to do.
B00846REIS|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS BOOK!!! I LOVE LISTENING TO THE BOOKS.. THEY SEEM SO MUCH MORE REAL...PLUS I CANT STAY AWAKE IF I HAVE TO LOOK AND READ!!!
B001ANYDAO|4.0|This a great book! If you ever wanted a working theory on how to be successful, or how those you admired became successful, this is the book to read. Very thought provoking, convincing, creative and entertaining!
1582701709|5.0|A very inspiring read to keep and refer to often. In this never ending negative world it is wonderful to find people who are positive and constructively believing.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This cord is great and works good.<br /> It's a lot better made then the cord that came with my device.
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|This is a really fun punching game with lots of upgrades and customizations for your character, I would recommend it.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I read the short story that this novel grew out of, a few years ago.  I like Sloan's short stories a lot, so when this novel came out, I grabbed it.  I wasn't sure if I would like the longer story, but I am very happy to report that this story is wonderful.  I read one the reviews that said then ending was a little disappointing, but I felt it was perfect.  This is  a tale filled with an odd rare bookstore, an odd bookstore manager, advanced technology, a conspiracy theory, all wrapped in great storytelling and humor.
B0038AUY96|5.0|A simply wonderful read. Well written, not too many characters, and suspenseful. Very hard too put down. Jo Nesbo must be up there with the very best fiction writers. I read a medical thriller immediately after Snowman & it diss splinting compare to nesbo.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|As always a well written page turner. Wonderful trilogy hope she will continue on with these memorable characters. Every book so far I can't put down. BRAVA
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Pam is funny and gets  to the  point. This book is not a waist of time. It will leave you with a new desire for life. I have recommend this book to many, and will be reading it again and again!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I really came to enjoy this novel. It's the sequel to the well known bestseller The Shining, so you might be worried that well: it's just some kind of sequel with endless callbacks and trite rehashing. You would be completely wrong. King makes the wise decision of opening us up to a totally new ghostly mythos.<br /><br />Yes, Dan Torrance is grown-up and a main character, but we get to learn what that has meant. His family legacy of alcoholism has deeply changed his own life, and Dan's struggles as a man at the bottom of society who will do terrible things for booze and girls is painfully believable. However, Dan's trajectory in life is changed by many things and before long he needs to help a charming young girl with an extraordinary amount of the Shining survive a terrible new threat.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the novel so I'll just leave you with that summary. It knocked it out of the park on all levels for me in terms of characters, dialogue, and creativity. I recommend it.
B00025ETIW|4.0|The description said used but good and when it came in the mail is was all cracked and scratched. But for the price I paid for it, I expected this so it's not that big of a deal. Still, the description was a little misleading.
B00BEF1AEK|2.0|Very nice and fun to play app, but it crashes too often. Apart from it I don't know how to exit the app - there's not any button to close the app.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I had never seen this before and so was pleasantly surprised at how original it is.  Not too scary, but enough to keep you alert.  The cast is great, too!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is the best hunting game I've played in a long time. I'm surprised how good it is on my kindle fire, excellent results.
B00GBCMW9S|2.0|Similar to his Recovery album which I didn't like much either. I only liked the two songs that had been on the radio.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love this game so much every time i play kindle i have to play this game the only problem is the energy the should give more energy or have no energy
B00139XTG4|5.0|Great insightful and deep read. The author makes a great case of major aspects of our lives being uncontrollable and to be wary of proclaimed experts and open to possibilities.
B0060ZJ74O|5.0|This movie is yet one more case of true stories being better than those made up.  Brad Pitt, even in a role very different for him, was again wonderful and very likable.  I will watch this movie repeatedly!
B00004VVNB|5.0|Love it. Very good buy for the price. Hope to get more. Can't go wrong if you purchase  gave 5stars
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Outstanding book and a very fast read.  Very interesting story and you can relate to the characters, who are very human.  Excellent character development and writing style.  Several laugh-out-loud moments but also makes you feel for the characters who are quite flawed.  Highly recommended.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I am not much of a SNL fan, and 30 Rock left a bad taste in my mouth when I randomly sampled a few episodes. Then my boyfriend and his friends started make 30 Rock references constantly and I gave it another try and fell in love with Tina Fey. She is ridiculously relatable, funny, and honest in the book. As a young woman in science, I also found many of her subtle messages in the book about being a &#34;boss', being smart, etc. very encouraging and endearing. This book is a light read, not overly funny or slapstick, but still very entertaining. I would imagine that all ages and sexes would like it.
0399213015|1.0|the book was TINY!  like the size of a 4&#34; x 6&#34; index card.  I thought for $5.99 is would be the size of at least 8&#34; x 8&#34;.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This story was very insightful into the life of someone with a mental illness caused by a tragedy. It is also an easy, fun, read, very enjoyable. I would recommend this book.
B003R50FRI|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was not at all what I expected, but was interesting from page 1 and continued the interest for the whole book. It is really long though, so if you are not into mammoth books, you might want to give it a miss
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My bff kept telling me to read cause I would love it. Well she wasn't wrong..... it was an awesome book!!!
B004TI5N38|3.0|Likeable characters, but did not deliver the typical drama and suspense I have come to expect.  David Baldacci is one of my favorite authors, but I feel he missed the mark a bit with this one.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|This game has been pretty great so far. There is just a small thing I would add, and that tiny thing is, adding a bit more coins made by killing the demons. Other than that it is really fun.
0385751532|5.0|The Boy In The Striped Pajamas through Amazon.<br /><br />Enjoyed the book.  It was well written and easy to read.  The book was used, but in excellent condition for a used book.  I received in a timely manner.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|The world is magnificent, the characters are engaging and the story is at times heart wrenching.  The world that Cassandra Clare has committed to these pages is one that you can easily immerse your self into.  Clary is headstrong and a teenager which is exactly as she has been written, as a believable teenager.  Jace has had to grow up before his time and that is also how he is written, as a believeable angsty teenager who has had to grow up before his time.  I loved the first book in this series and have loved all the subsequent books as well.  The characters are funny, engaging and far from insipid or predictable.
B003XVYLDU|1.0|Very difficult to follow. There doesn't seem to be any plot. My interest died after the first chapter but I had to read for book club. So it goes.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Buy this game trust me my little Bro wants it so bad I love it you won't wast your money unless you have no clue how to play best game in the world listen to me get this game
1451695195|2.0|Not really believable, and author's logic in assessing his own condition falls short. This doc nails the physiological portion but that's all. Says his brain wasn't functional, therefore the experience he had while comatose could not possibly have been a caused by a chemical response due to traumatic brain injury or pending brain death.  But the mere fact that his brain wasn't fatally injured meant it still had some functionality remaining; therefor it could indeed have been a brain chemical released in the process of brain injury or impending death. It wasn't dead; it revived, which proves it wasn't dead.<br /><br />His experience sounded a lot different from the spiritual experiences of the majority of those having near-death-experiences. It sounded much like a delusion or hallucination. The spiritual aspect of his NDE seemed lacking, and he seemed perhaps not quite as sincere as one might expect after such a profound revelation and encounter.<br /><br />His life sounds lovely (all those creature comforts). Maybe he experienced that earthworm/amoeba state because he had yet to learn humility. Or maybe everyone's death process is unique, and his was just customized to fit his particular consciousness.<br /> Guess we'll all find out, someday...
B00514HDNW|4.0|Having only seen the most recent version of the film (starring Will Smith, 2007), I was pleasantly surprised to see how different the book was from that adaptation. Not that I didn't enjoy the film, but the book was a nice departure. It was difficult to put the book down, right to the very end. Great characters, good complexity, and a great story.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Relaxing yet gripping, Mississippi racial politics meets trial lawyer twists... love Jake and love Grisham. Buy it -  you'll be up for hours·
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie is absolutely adorable. .whether you just like cute animated characters or relate to the main character, Gru, on an emotional  level of beiing a parent you cant help but grin at mischief the young girls and young at heart adults get up to in this movie.  there's plenty of humor for kids and more witty puns for adults. This movie will have the whole family laughing and having a good time.
B008602KQI|4.0|the book was better.  I didn't think much of Woody's performance (but then, I'm not a Woody fan and playing a drunk is always difficult)
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Its a great news album. He focusses more on rapping about himself and experiences he has had in his long controversial career than going after everyone else..I've loved Eminem since I was a kid and this is a totally new artist..love the album!
0062107313|3.0|Violet didn't have a conventional childhood.  She was raised in her mother's courtesan house and as an American.  Later though, she discovers she is half Chinese, leading her to questions what is her true self: As an American, or as a Chinese girl?  Circumstances rip the mother and daughter apart, leading Violet on a path to navigate the world of a Chinese courtesan all by herself.<br /><br />Overall, I thought the story was okay.  I think it went on a bit to much, with the story dragging on.  As well, whereas before I was invested in Violet's unfortunate twists of fate, by the end I was kind of numb.  Too many bad things seemed to have happened to her, and the last bad turn (a marriage to a countryside liar) just was to much for me and I wasn't able to really feel that bad for her.  It just felt like piling on.
0439023513|1.0|Like a lot of other reviewers I loved the first two books.  But this one felt vague and unfocused.  SPOILER ALERT. And what was the point of Prim's death?  She was the reason for Katniss' volunteering.  We already know war is awful so what purpose did Prim's death serve?  Maybe the point was to show that Katniss was the ultimate victim.  She ended up being used by everyone.  Wow, how uplifting.  This book destroyed the series for me.  All the strength in the first two books was gone.  This book was a letdown, very disappointing.

B004YRWA62|3.0|The idea of the movie  is good but the script is poorly written. I would recommend it but do not expect too much.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|A totally wonderful coming out story.  Good story line, was believable , good actors, and acting. Its like good comfort food. Well done!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This game is exactly what I've been looking for. Keeps you busy and has a ton of variety. Other games like this get boring quickly. Not this one. Good challenge&amp;  entertaining.
B009FXIICK|5.0|This was my favorite Nintendo DS game.  So glad it's available for android but dang!  now I'm not getting anything done.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Good book. Plot keeps you guessing.  Lots of thought provoking characters, twists and turns.  As usual, Mr Baldacci keeps you guessing.
B00BEF1AEK|1.0|What else can i say. It is annoying.<br />Put an option to exit or else your app will suck no matter what.<br />Can it be that hard??????
B00CDTSFF8|5.0|This is a very good show worth watching. I enjoyed the historical information and the way in which it was used in the production.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|This is a great read!  Tough is very convincing that there are ways to help all children succeed.  Character is vital and I agree with Tough that we can teach these skills if we look at children on the whole. Paul Tough didn't quote any research by the very successful Reading Recovery program which does take the lowest readers.  It has been successful for thirty years.  Reading Recovery also trains it's teachers continually.  It targets first graders. Even though Tough didn't include Reading Recovery, he's done an excellent job thinking about character, grit, and curiosity.  My hat's off to him to write a helpful book for people who are in the trenches trying to help children succeed.
B001CTGQBK|5.0|it's not one of the classic charmers for nothing.<br />Wise, witty, and wonderful, GREASE shows us ourselves no matter the era. : )
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It was very enjoyable to read another book by Mr. Grisham in the style that first attracted me to him. I would highly recommend this one to those that liked his first books.
B00ERH15WY|5.0|Greg singing Xmas songs ! wow! That is the last thing I was expecting from Bad Religion and it's....Fantastic :)
B00BEF1AEK|4.0|Update: I can't stop playing this silly game. It's as addictive as Angry Birds. As you increase levels, you get extra little games. And you get to \\"speak\\" to the King and find out his secrets. I found one secret. Cannot find any more! :)<br /><br />--- Original review<br />King Oddball is definitely odd. He has an extra long tongue that he uses to hurl rocks at tanks and helicopters to destroy them.<br /><br />While it in no way compares to the level of variety, finesse, and sophistication of Angry Birds, the objectives are similar. You hurl stuff to destroy your targets, which are shielded under or behind various obstructions. While Angry Birds uses a slingshot, King Oddball uses his tongue and you have to touch the screen at the right time to release the missile.<br /><br />It's a simple game and the graphics are just okay. But it's silly and fun, and I'm enjoying it a lot so far. You don't seem to rack up points or stars, but  after level 2 you can earn various types of achievements.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|We have been watching this as a family since our son was four.  We can all enjoy it without worrying that the humor is inappropriate for our child or that we will be annoyed by juvenile dialogue.
B007X6SMD6|4.0|Excellent read for starters. Doing the hands on examples helps. Amazon should introduce online videos and tutorials to educate the masses.
B00F1W1SS0|4.0|I was really looking forward to this release.  Dream Theater is a tremendous band but live is where they really shine so, to me, the live releases are always my favorite.  This release doesn't disappoint.....almost....<br /><br />Visuals:  Top notch quality.  Good camera angles and cuts although you miss Portnoy's influence on the production.<br /><br />Band Playing:  Best in years.  I love Portnoy and Mangini but the band seems so energized and excited with this new lineup.  Mangini brings a different musicality to the performances and the personalities of the other band members really shine through.  In particular John Myung's bass playing stands out for me in this release.<br /><br />Sound:  Ahhh yes the sound.  I have to admit that I watched this Blu Ray before I read a single review and found some serious issues with the sound.  In particular when James LaBrie is singing &#34;softly&#34; the &#34;S&#34; hisses and pops from his mic/processing are distracting to the point that I have to fast forward.  Also the cymbal mic'ing is terribly uneven.  The mix is not the best and, in my opinion, doesn't convey the collective energy of the band.<br /><br />Overall:  &#34;A&#34; for performances and visuals.  &#34;B-&#34; for sound.  A- overall because I can get past the sound issues.<br /><br />Next time please please please hire Kevin Shirley to engineer and mix your live releases.  He is the master of catching heavy bands live (see Budokan, Iron Maiden, and anything else he has touched).
B00CGNYDIE|3.0|I downloaded this game as the FAOTD because I enjoy logic puzzles and really like this developer's FlipPix game,which was another FAOTD recently. As a previous reviewer stated, it is a sort of a mix between the FlipPix-type nonogram, where you  color square tiles in a grid, based on the clues for the rows and columns, and Minesweeper, where you have to figure out the placement of adjacent mines in the hex grid.<br /><br />At the easy and intermediate levels, the puzzles a pretty easy to solve as long as you pay attention to the tutorial and &#34;get it&#34;. However, at the challenging level, I am pretty sure that some tiles could not be colored without using some guessing, even after using hints -- unless you go through a long process of elimination in your head. (Unlike FlipPix, there isn't a way of excluding tiles).<br /><br />However, after trying out a puzzle or two from all three levels, I find I am not enjoying this game very much. What I particularly don't like about it is that you can only see parts of the game board at a time. The tiles seem to be unnecessarily HUGE and you can further magnify each one. There is no option to reduce the scale so you can see the whole game board at once, or at least more of it. So you are constantly scrolling around to see different parts of the board. I keep finding that after I select tiles and try to color them, I get an error message and didn't know why. It is usually because I have selected some other tiles in a different part of the board and haven't cleared them before making another selection - but I can't see them. The game does take you to the part of the board where you had made a selection, but only after marking your error.<br /><br />Also, while the pictures of the hot air balloons are pleasant, they aren't particularly interesting, so they're not much of an incentive for me to want to continue playing in order to reveal the pictures.

B00G4U7TO0|4.0|it's a good album, very folky, well performed and produced.  My only knock on it is that it's quite mellow sounding, i guess my expectations with seeing the Punch Bros & T-Bone Burnett's influence is that it would be a bit more raucous sounding.  It's still worth the purchase though.

B005F9TQ0Q|5.0|Classic Dylan remastered.  The CD is not a true update of the orginal 8 track/ablum as &#34;Big Yellow Taxi was dropped.  The album does have a wider range of Bob's songs than some of his more popular albums.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|An entertaining  but predicable but  movie with some  good thrill moments in the first half.  As usual Denzel did a decent acting job.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This game is lots of fun and delightful to play.  I always thought I would never be able to learn how to play MAHJONG, but boy was I pleasantly surprised when I decided to try the Kindle version.  This game should be fun for just about anyone.  I found it to be basically a matching game utilizing Chinese symbols.  So for anyone who might be curious about the game, I urge them to take a chance.  I'm sure they will really enjoy it.

B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great skills game on tablet or phone. I will recommend to all.<br />The graphics and controls are great and it all gets better at each level.
B007UXTG8M|5.0|A visceral and raw study of someone struggling to deal with an addiction that threatens to dominate their life. Director Steve McQueen's unflinching style matched with Michael Fassbender's dedication to character combine to form a harrowing look at someone slowly losing control to their inner demons. Also of note was the stellar performance by Carey Mulligan in a surprising diversion from her usual roles that pays off handsomely.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I don't think another review us needed in addition to all the other ones, but Amazon asked.  I was disappointed in this book, and not because of the ended.  I felt like the main protagonists were not only hard to distinguish one from the other, but we also acting like different characters than in the first 2 books.  The story was very rushed and too many new elements were added that there was not time taken to develope them.  The main conflict developed through the first 2 books was essentially ignored this entire book and then very quickly tied up in the last few chapters.  I LOVED the first 2 books and the characters in them and just feel like they deserved a more we'll thought out ending.  That is not to say it has to be a happy ending, because not all ending are happy, but story which does justice to the characters.

B00CXQL828|5.0|Great classic rocking, reminds me of good old school ass kicking rock.<br />Saw them live and was a great show. We need more music like this these days. Great musicians.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|The perspective changes threw me for a loop and kind of gave away the ending (why else would she need to do this when she hadn't done it before?). I still enjoyed it though. I will read books from this author again and I still think the story as a whole was entertaining.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|we all can connect to this story. the<br /><br /> characters are so realistic and lovable.  must read! I'm sure you will. love it
B00BD99JMW|5.0|*Spoiler alert* Despite what many others are saying, I think the ending of this series was perfect!  The beginning of this book was slightly boring, and slightly repetitive, but as you read through, you will find the thrill that was found in the first two books of this trilogy.  Many people were disappointed in the ending because of Tris' death, but I believe in a way it was an excellent way to end the series.  The reason for this is that the end of the series had total closure.  Tris, throughout all of the books, was known to be a hero that values the lives of others greatly.  This need to help others brought on by her Abnegation roots, including the courage she had, made her an excellent Dauntless.  If Tris had not willingly sent herself into the room filled with death serum and allowed Caleb to go in, Tris would not have the same personality, which would lead us to question her true character throughout the duration of Divergent and Insurgent.  Tris dying from the death serum would have been expected, so the murder of Tris was very clever.  Tobias' period of depression was a way to show that he truly cared about Tris in way that was beyond words.  Later, when Tobias finally spread Tris' ashes, it was a way for him to face his fears just as all dauntless always do, but it also symbolized where he and Tris started in the initiation.  This was the moment where the reader realizes that Tobias is freeing himself of the pain brought on by the memory of Tris and allowing himself to remember her for the person she was, not the circumstances. We see that although Tris was dead, Tobias' love for her was undying.
140006922X|2.0|At first read Aslan's account of Jesus during the Roman occupation is well researched and he offers an abundance of references to justify his points.  It is an interesting read at times. His most repetitive point is that Jesus failed in his mission to usher in the Kingdom of God. The other is that his followers altered their account of the life and death of Christ to fit prophecy. Aslan's own personal conversion experience and subsequent disillusionment with Christianity and return to Islam clouds the pages of his book.  If you reject the deity of Christ and simply proclaim to be a failed messiah then submit that he was just a prophet or nice man you miss the point of his life and death. The Bible and any book that chronicles the interaction of the creator with humanity requires faith.  One can no more prove the existence of God or the deity of Christ since these are matters of faith.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works as expected. Cannot beat it given the functionality and price point. If you're eager to minimize cable and device clutter, this is for you.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Loved the first book in the series.  Great characters, good plotting.  Felt like all the juice in the big idea was in that first book.  By this third in the series, the slow reveal of what really happened in the world didn't work for me.  Didn't like the shifting viewpoints - felt too much like a fiction-writers' workshop exercise.  And I guess the characters were flat.  It still gets three stars because the idea was cool enough and it was written well enough that I wanted to finish.  Finally, not at all happy with the ending, which seemed melodramatic and a bit like &#34;Well, not sure what to do next, so _____[no spoilers]&#34;.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Dear Emma,<br /><br />Thank you for literally making me laugh more than any book I've read so far. From the opening line to a sweet ending....it was pee in your pants hilarious. I'm going to recommend this to all my friends. Absolute perfection!

B00E5Q9VSW|5.0|Leonidas Kavakos - the Greek super-star of the violin - proves himself as a prolific artist not only regarding his live appearances (at most prestigious musical venues) but also his recordings. This happens since he signed with DECCA.<br />Kavakos last release successfully focuses on Barhms. Accompanied by Gewandhaus Leipzig Orchestra under Riccardo Chally in the Violin Concerto and by pianist Peter Nagy in Hungarian Dances, Kavakos dominates the proceedings in a magisterial manner. A fabulous technical precision serves an impeccable musical vision throughout. The only reproach one could arise regards the slow tempi Kavakos favours (sometimes, even where they are inappropriate). However, on the whole his vision (in the Concerto) breathes a fresh air having an inspired personal flavour At the same time, two Rhapsodies by Bartok complete the program rounding off a recording with a persistent Hungarian perfume.<br />A personal detail: just seven days ago I was the privileged witness of Kavakos masterful interpretation of the Brahms concerto at Musikverein Wien where his orchestral partners were the same Gewandhaus musicians led by their chief conductor Riccardo Chailly, this concert being part of the complete Brahms cycle. So, this recording is for me a material memory of those wonderful moments of music.
0307237702|2.0|I started reading the book but have never finished it. I found it to be something I am not interested in. I had read Barak Obama's book about his life and thought this would be a good addition to it but was disappointed.
B0087GZ8YW|3.0|Not the best Rebus by far. Good to see him back but this yarn is a bit thin on the ground, it all ties together well but does not have the page turning grit of past books, maybe not only Rebus is getting  a bit old!.
1452115567|5.0|Lovelly book.  Bought an extra copy for my neighors, and they love it even more than I do.  Great holidy stocking stuffer for dog lovers.
B00E6G23TA|5.0|I am writing this review a week after coming from Vienna where I followed the four evenings of the Brahms cycle offered by Riccardo Chailly and his fabulous players from Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra at the Golden Hall Musikverein. The impression was overwhelming. Conductor's vision proved itself as authoritative and inspired throughout, while the response of the orchestra quite thrilling both in musical and technical terms.<br /><br />Therefore, I decided on spot to buy this 3-CD box set issued recently - with the same cast - by the prestigious DECCA label. The repeated listening of the mighty symphonies (along with other orchestral pieces by the same composer included on these recordings) enchants me at the same extent as their live performances did several days ago.<br /><br />Despite all the criticisms regarding the brisk tempos Chailly enforces in these symphonies, I honestly find his version as utterly able to stand on equal footing with the old canonical versions (which, he is telling us in the liner notes, have long stood as inspirational benchmarks for him - especially Weingartner's). One can observe as well both the large-scale structure lines of each symphony and its finest details regarding the harmonic textures or melodic cells to be developed in Brahms's magisterial sense of variation. On the other hand, it is equally true that the sentimental side of these works is somehow blurred which could disturb traditional listeners. However, Chailly claims that his vision aims at shaking up the tradition (with its established habits) when it comes to Brahms interpretation. And he acts manifestly in this respect - though strictly following the score - with notable success.<br /><br />In my view, an excellent achievement for Chailly and his Gewandhaus Orchester Leipzig! Bravo!
B001FOPODS|1.0|It was a dark, gloomy version of the original.  I only watched 10 minutes of it and turned it off.  I was planning on showing it to my third graders, but realized it wasn't suitable.
193700788X|2.0|because it isnt really a novel or story. it is simply a set of short words about what happened to each character after the end of the last novel in alphabetical order with some graphics. i expected and paid for a real novel. it was disappointing.
B001NOD0Q8|4.0|Compelling science fiction novel with more on its mind than space battles. The fascinating story of three siblings, each a genius, each destined for greatness. At age 9 Andrew &#34;Ender&#34; Wiggin is the youngest and apparently the human being best-equipped to lead humanity to victory against a technologically superior race of insects that threaten Earth - if he survives the years of training and psychological challenges thrown at him in the orbiting Battle School. Meanwhile, on Earth, his sister Valentine and murderous brother Peter, still pre-pubescent, put into motion a politically savvy campaign of philosophy and influence designed to make Peter the eventual ruler of all mankind. As Ender's prowess grows, his minders continue to stack the deck against him, determined to either break him or make him the greatest general in Earth history. Peter and Valentine, using false identities to hide their age, begin to drive Earth's uneasy factions towards global war.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that the &#34;surprises&#34; at the novel's end are telegraphed so far in advance, but the story holds your interest, and provides a satisfying denouement that is bittersweet and thoughtful.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I took less than 2 days to finish this book.  I loved how they told the story from multiple points of view.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|I loved everything about this book. Definitely an astounding book. I'm so glad I stumbled upon it. My favorite characters are cather and wrens father along with Levi. This is a must read. Xo

B008XG1X18|3.0|I love the app, but after a while it stops working too frequently. It will crash multiple times a day an  this is the third time I have re installed this app. It makes me a little sad :(
0553212621|3.0|D.H. Lawrence is a wonderful writer. His picture of the class system in England is spot on, but when it comes to a woman's sexuality which is what this book is about<br />, he gets it wrong.
B00DUE8IXY|5.0|This is a great record.  Buy it now. Sometimes, it doesn't take that many words to make a review.  This record exceeded my expectations.

B00722ZHG6|5.0|I was reluctant to try this...yet another tween record.  But fortunately someone whom I respect told me to give it a try and wow. This is really a great record.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Typical Grisham, you never know what will pop up next. I read the book in two days, couldn't put it down
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I have been a superman fan since 1950s, seen it all. This was by far the best film ever. I was tired of the wimpy guy who never did anything human. This version did what had to be done to Zod, dude killed his Daddy twice! The action was not overdone, loved the emphasis on alien heritage and technology. Effects were spot on. Just an opinion from a 60 year old supe fan.
B000NDETLK|5.0|A must have for any Jane Austin Fan, its pretty, and all that a Regance Drama on DVD should be. BUT you better be set up to view overseas DVDs or its a bust because this disk won't play on an AMERICAN DVD player.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game is unlike any game that I have played. It makes me think that I am very clever!  Fun!
030758836X|5.0|The novel was an easy, breezy read that kept me flipping pages throughout the night. I appreciated the anticipation of the unclear finish and the twists the novel finally took. While the ending left me in utter shock, it also left me feeling without closure. I am curious to see how this story will play out/be depicted on the big screen. Highly recommended
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Enjoyed the book,however, I felt that there were to many characters to keep track of. Had a hard time putting Sycamore Row down.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I can trust the information. The app is user friendly and I really enjoy the option of the audio reading when I am not in a position to read it myself.
B008JFUPFI|2.0|I watched this with some friends the other night.  Honestly, the best part was referencing the other movies it made us think of.  The &#34;world engine&#34; scene - &#34;Mr. Incredible, Mr. Incredible!&#34;  The part where Zod's got him by the cape and is swinging him around?  Imagine E's voice: &#34;No capes!&#34;  The building where Zod dies...hey, wasn't that destroyed in Avenger's, too?  Or a building incredibly like it?<br />The flashbacks were useful in a way, but as I prefer a straight storyline, they quickly became annoying as well.  One or two flashbacks don't interrupt the continuity of a story for me, but this had more like five or six.<br />I'll confess up front that I haven't followed the comic books, so when I think to myself that I prefer the original storyline, I'm basing that on the original TV series and movies.<br />Yeah.  I won't be upset if someone else wants to watch it when I'm around, but I won't vote for it, either.
B008FSCNTK|4.0|A departure for Ms. Krall and the vibe does grow on me. I'm still a bigger fan of her straight ahead offerings (particularly her tribute to Nat King Cole) but I appreciate her stretching her wings on this.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|a truly compelling story, beautifully written. I had not read it when it was first published and everyone I knew was surprised it had slipped through the cracks. Now I know why.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I agree with the authors complaints about the media and government officals for fighting a nice war. A very good book
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game. Running away from the cop and his dog is so amazingly fun. I love it, it's really great.
B004UPANAI|5.0|Love Wolverine! Just enough action with a little romance thrown in. My 9 year old son really loved it too.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|OK...did lots of research, didn't know whether to go with a flat scanner or one of these small units.  SO GLAD I went with this DBTech slide scanner.  Lots of us Baby Boomers took nothing but Kodachrome Slides from the early 70's to the early 80's, so I was looking for a way to turn about 2500 slides into JPG images.<br /><br />Unbelievable!  Can't believe this thing receives anything less than 5 stars!  It is fast, the slides are copied pretty much the way you took them, there is light correction, and if you become adapt at &#34;when to capture&#34; the image as the light correction takes place, your slides will come back to life.  Have already thrilled my children and other friends by putting some of these 1970's era images on Facebook.<br /><br />I am thrilled with this unit, have converted every single one of those 2500 slides into JPG images, and it was totally worth the $50 bucks I paid to get it.  Good job DBTech...it's not often that a product exceeds one's expectations.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to download, easy to view, change versions and read. You even have an option on some version for this to be on speaker too! Great tool, great app.

B00DUGCLY4|5.0|this game is awesome I wish it was not so hard I am. stuck on the soft ball one and the shoe.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Just finished playing.....all I can say is Wow! Fantastic graphics, challenging, interesting story line, long game play, and my favorite thus far from Big Fish Games. I will gladly keep forking over my money for more games like this one! 5 stars is not enough.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This is one of the best, most comfortable headsets I've ever owned.  The range on the headset is great, I can nearly walk around my house.  I've been pretty impressed by the battery life as well.  It doesn't last all day, but several hours - plenty for what I do.  The sound is clear and the voice is perfect.
1451695195|1.0|The unfortunate of this entire situation is that this guy is a complete fraud.  A good deal of what is in this book is simply made up or exadurated by him, and I would hope that anyone seeking some spiritual closure or professional would take the time to do a bit of background research on the person writing the book and the real life facts (as opposed to what he has written in this book) and how those facts conflict with his narrative of the story.<br /><br />If he would have been open and honest about the facts surrounding his afterlife experience (as well as his shaded past) one might be able to take stock in what he has said.  As it stands though the man seems to be nothing but a con artist looking for a quick buck after his multiple failures in his medical career.<br /><br />This is the age of information though so please, if you happen to read my review take a few moments to research the man behind this book and ask yourself if he is someone who you would want to be taking a spiritual journey with?
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|This game is really fun it just sucks you only get to play like 4 levels for free so u can't really sample before u buy not even If u get expert all the way...
0316017930|5.0|I highly suggest this book to anyone and especially to those who have a strong desire to learn more about the world of success. How did Bill Gates become a billionaire? And how do professional hockey players get so good at hockey? These are the questions that seem so obvious, but keep us asking, how did these outliers really come about? What is their journey? In Malcolm Gladwell’s book, Outliers, he takes the reader on a journey to find out. Gladwell says talent, intellect and ambition all play a role in success, but when the truly successful are analyzed, the worlds greatest minds and achievers, there is much more to the story. His intellectual journey goes onto explain the opportunity and legacy required for the world’s brightest outliers. When were they born? How did they grow up and where? Throughout his journey he shows how and when certain outliers deviated away from all the rest. Some outliers and their stories include, professional hockey players and why they’re born in the winter, what Bill Gates, Paul Allen and Bill Joy all have in common, why people who live in the south are more aggressive than those who live in the north, why Asian’s are better than Americans at mathematics, and why the country with the safest pilots also has the most crashes. Gladwell lays down the blueprint for outliers, and gives the story of success.
B00FW668H6|5.0|Some info in case you didn't know.  The 2013 Zappa remaster is a case where the new non-brickwalled mastering (by Bob Ludwig) makes a difference. You WILL hear details buried in the murk of the 1990 transfer......<br /><br />Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band: Don \\"Captain Beefheart\\" Van Vliet (vocals, soprano & tenor saxophone, bass clarinet, simran horn, musette); \\"Antennae\\" Jimmy Stevens (vocals, guitar); Victor \\"The Mascara Snake\\" Hayden (vocals, bass clarinet); Mark \\"Rockette Morton\\" Boston (narration, bass); Bill \\"Zoot Horn Rollo\\" Harkleroad (guitar, flute); Doug Moon (guitar); John \\"Drumbo\\" French (drums).  Produced by Frank Zappa.  Arranged by Don Van Vliet.  Mastered by Bob Ludwig at Gateway Mastering, 2012.<br /><br />A great, sprawling, discordant work of genius--TROUT MASK REPLICA gives the lie to the frequent criticism that all double albums are exercises in self indulgence. Or perhaps in Captain Beefheart's case it's impossible to separate the self indulgence from the meaningful art--certainly the pieces you may feel on first listening to be the most excessively obscure are those that keep you coming back for more. Embedded in this influential, messy, confusing yet brilliant enterprise are a plethora of sui generis gems such as \\"Ella Guru\\" and \\"Neon Meate Dream of a Octafish,\\" though \\"China Pig\\" with its electric blues accompaniment finds Beefheart harking back to his Howlin' Wolf roots, and \\"Well\\" is similarly rooted in old Southern work songs--though obviously as sung by Salvador Dali. The sound is by turns murky, amateurish, and compellingly powerful. The Magic Band churns and twists under the Captain's direction, and on tracks such as \\"When Big Joan Sets Up,\\" rocks as fiercely as Cecil Taylor. But be warned--after hearing TROUT MASK REPLICA, you'll never be able to listen to music in quite the same way again........<br /><br />TRACK LISTING:<br />1. Frownland<br />2.

B008Y7EYSK|5.0|One of my new favorites.  Really under appreciated.  Scary, suspenseful, and unpredictable.  Seen it several times and still jump in a couple scenes.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Ruined the game when they made Frankenbltzy elite while we were all trying to finish it.  Deleted the game from kindle and Facebook.
147676459X|5.0|My love affair with Allie Brosh and Hyperbole and a Half started with the Alot and I've never looked back.  Her ability to convey emotions through her wonderfully childlike drawings is a thing of wonder to me, especially when it comes to Simple Dog and Helper Dog.  While I wish the book had included more new stories, I still loved it and hope she writes another at some point.
B00A9X9ORI|1.0|This movie was quite overrated.  I'm typically a fan of recent Bruce Willis movies, but I thought this movie worked too hard to be &#34;smart&#34;, and instead of being smart, it came off as deliberate, and it failed to deliver what was promised.
B00C7607BC|5.0|Great movie, not sure of what else to say. I've been a Disney fan my whole life and I'm glad Amazon has the classes on Blu-ray.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|James Rollins never disappoints.  Every bit as good as Dan Brown without the Uber-Religious bopping you on the head every 3 pages.
0385743564|4.0|'Steelheart' is the beginning of an inventive and thrilling new YA science fiction/fantasy series. It follows main character David as he devotes his life to learning as much as he can about the Epics - humans with superhuman powers who rule the rest of the world. Especially the Epic who killed his father and currently runs the city of Newcago - Steelheart. David has been learning as much about the Epics as he can, along with the vigilante group hunting them - the Reckoners. David's convinced that if he joins with the Reckoners, together they can finally stop Steelheart and the Epic's reign.<br /><br />This novel was exceptionally well imagined and unique. I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked it up, but I was immediately drawn into the fascinating world that the author created. I loved learning all about this alternate world - the history, how the world became the way it is now, and how people live in this place. I was completely fascinated by the Epics - all their powers and weaknesses along with their diverse personalities and villianish styles. The Reckoners were a curious group that I enjoyed getting to know. Each of the team had their own personalities with strengths and weaknesses, which made them realistic and accessible. David was a great main character - smart, devoted, brave, strong and determined to do the right thing for the world concerning the Epics. The world in the book, as I mentioned before, was so vivid and detailed that I felt like I was right there alongside David and the Reckoners. The writing was fast paced with lots of action and awesome fighting. I'm really glad that this is going to be a series because there's so much more to the characters and the world that the author created and I want to read about it all! Highly recommended for fans of science fiction, fantasy and dystopias, as well as someone who wants an exciting and original story.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received a copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Other than Breaking Bad, Walking Dead is one of the smartest, suspenseful TV shows we've watched since Lost and the Sopranos.  Season Three lived up to the other two seasons, we are hopeful that the show doesn't lose its steam as it ages.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|amazing book. a book that no one can put down. not much of a reader but I could not put this down
B00CATSONE|1.0|This doesn't deserve to be an ebook...more like an e-pamphlet.  It provides no new or unique, or even mildly entertaining, insight into who Tesla was.  It just seems to regurgitate a lot of the most popular facts of this important inventor, rather than actually show any new work from the author.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham at his best!!This man can weave a tale better than anybody around. Court room drama is his forte.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|The book promised to be as riveting as Gone Girl, but unfortunately the plot seemed a bit contrived, and drug on.
B00DBOF5Q6|2.0|Dorrigo Evans was an Australian surgeon who found himself in a Prisoner of War camp in 1943; prisoner of the cruel, vindictive and heartless Japanese who were determined to build the Burma Railway for the Emperor at any cost. Death of the POW inhabitants was an honour was their mantra. Dorrigo spent his time desperately trying to save the lives of his fellow prisoners; he had some sway with the Japanese Corporal, but more often than not the prisoners died – malnutrition, starvation, cholera and the daily beatings were reducing their numbers rapidly.<br /><br />Dorrigo’s affair with his Uncle Keith’s wife, Amy, haunted him – while training near Adelaide prior to heading into the war, the two of them had met and a hidden relationship began and flourished. His girlfriend from Melbourne, Ella, slipped to the back of his mind; sometimes he couldn’t even remember what she looked like. But a letter he received while in the POW camp devastated him; his first communication from home in eight months and he felt it destroy him.<br /><br />The story of the Burma death railway still has eerie connotations today – some say it is haunted by all the souls who died there. This story is brutal, the descriptions deep and distressing. It could have been epic, a literary masterpiece – the subject matter and history is. I was incredibly disappointed in it – the prose was jerky and inconsistent in my opinion, and with the continual jumping between past, present and past again, it made it difficult to keep up. My annoyance with the way it was written spoilt what should have been a great story.
B00BIHWVWY|5.0|This one is great! I love it  It's fast and cheap. I recommend this for you music listeners on your tablet :) just wonderful.
B004KPLVW2|5.0|Nice! Great to see some really interesting extras, including original interviews with the producer, director/writer and some of the the others involved in making the distinctive technology that went into making this movie possible.
B003UAHIM0|4.0|Great movie for preteens with exception of one &#34;F&#34; word, unfortunately.  If you preview the movie and know where it's coming, it's fun for a former Star Wars fanatic.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The chromecast was super easy to set up and use. Connected easily to my home wi-fi network, and I can quickly move it from one room to another just by un/plugging it in! I've cancelled my $100+ a month cable subscription finally because i can get what I need through this or local antenna. Being able to stream from my phone, laptop, or tablet is super convenient and easy, great way to play music through my tv & audio system via Pandora! Thinking about buying a 2nd one just because...<br /><br />You NEED to have a good high quality FAST internet connection for this to be successful in your house. That's probably a big reason why some people have issues. .  That and running xp. Who still uses xp??
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great writing style, very engaging story, but some parts dragged on a bit for me. Can't wait to read the next one though!
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|Just simply a beautiful, beautiful move and wonderfully rendered in blu-ray. Very happy to watch this in 5.1 as well, amazing bass content just like the original!
B009RI4ZKC|1.0|This movie was very overrated.  No one could stay awake throughout the movie.  I am usually a fan of the actors in the movie, but this was difficult to watch.
B00E9P959O|5.0|Excellent album.  Best album of theirs since Grace Under Pressure.  Their 70s and 80s output is much better but this is by far their best since then.
B00EVW0SA0|5.0|Great entertainment. Kept you on your toes with action. Jamie Fox and Tatum Channing are a great combination. Great plot.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was the worst book I have ever read!!!  This excuse of a book actually promotes violence towards women.  Like there are not enough dominating and controlling men in the world.  If the main character was not rich, he would be put in jail.  I had to skip most of the graphic episodes.  I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this.  To top it off, it is terribly written.  Amature hour.  I can't believe women would put this book on top sellers list (which is why I was curious).  Oh, and did I mention I hate this book. I want my money back.
B009HELT3C|4.0|Cute follow-up to a franchise that faltered in the second movie.  It was entertaining, and Brolin was a genius as a young Tommy Lee!  The whole family LOVED it!
B00F031X62|3.0|I was jumping out of my shoes to think there was a newly released Jimi Hendrix &#34;Experience&#34; live set coming out but wanted to wait until reviews came out before taking the plunge. While I can't say I regret the purchase, I will say what's already out there is far superior to this set. Winterland, for one has excellent sound and stunning performances of his greatest works. My first concert ever was the Jimi Hendrix Experience in White Plains, N.Y. so Jimi and this particular line-up carry a special place in my heart. The performance on this set is very good. If you're a Jimi fan, you will want it. It is an outdoor festival show however and whatever equipment they used to capture the event leaves much to be desired. Introductions and even comments from Jimi before tracks sound muddy, almost bootleg in quality. While the songs are in progress, the sound quality is decent so go figure. It's almost like they mixed two sound sources to put the disc together. Maybe they did? In any event, it makes the sound quality uneven and hard to choose this over some of the better quality live material from the box sets or Winterland. Overall, while it's something any Jimi fan may want in his or her collection, I doubt it will get much rotation on anyone's playlist and I don't think this set is one Jimi would have been proud of or wanted out there. It definitely wouldn't have met his standards!
B007Q476KU|5.0|Very good movie. Amazing how they can train animals to act so well. A feel good movie for the whole family. Great specoial efects.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|What a disappointment- the quality of the writing just doesn't compare wth the first tow books, which I thought were fabulous.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I couldn't decide between 4 and 5 stars and finally 5 won out because this book is long. Really long. And yet I was never bored. I didn't skim sections or hurry past certain situations that were not my favorite and I didn't ever wish that I had almost reached the end. Instead, I looked forward to immersing myself in this masterful, sprawling, Dickensian, character-driven drama each and every time I picked it up. Tartt's narrative is captivating. I actually finished the book at roughly 2:30 AM today. I was having a hard time staying awake somewhere around 11 PM but went into the kitchen for a drink of water and came back with a second wind, glad to be able to keep my eyes open long enough to finally find out what happens in Amsterdam! If you haven't read any other reviews of this book yet, don't. You don't want any spoilers! There were sections of the book that were not my favorite and one or two characters that didn't quite ring true to me, but for the most part the story, setting and characters are extremely well thought out and realistic. Hoping we don't have to wait another ten years for Tartt's next novel, but I can certainly understand how it might take that long to write something of the magnitude of The Goldfinch.
B006RXPSLK|5.0|This is a great cult classic and the streaming quality is excellent.  The sequel was not as good but what are you going to do.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It took a few chapters to figure out who was narrating but once you get that, the story just flows beautifully. I loved the story and will probably read it a second time.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It is everything I want in an e-book. Keep the books coming.  I appreciate you Kindle Android. Thanks a million
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Fizzles out after building for the first two books.  Became &#34;preachy&#34; in the middle which diverted from the story and what I perceived to be the &#34;point&#34; of the trilogy
B00FEHXCIG|2.0|Ugh.  They ruined the franchise with this one the same way they ruined Robo Cop when they did Robocop 3 by trying too hard to make it a &#34;kid movie&#34;.  The visual FX were great, the action sequences were great, but where the hell is the plot?  And why does Iron Man become such a pussy?  Really, the story was kinda lame on several fronts.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I bought this as a gift and he loves it!  Can't go wrong with the best series on television in years.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|It took me a little to get into the story but about 2/3 into the book, I couldn't put it down.  The ending was a surprise and I cried (always a sign it was a good book!).
B00G91WB3S|5.0|OK whoever gives this movie a bad review needs to get their nutcase checked. Seriously? this is the best superman ever. I don't leave many reviews about movies but this deserves 10 stars not 5 that Amazon allows. Simply put, it's Amazing.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|It's a great series. I love to buy the season on Amazon because I just can't stand those network commercials!  It's  so worth a couple of dollars to watch uninterrupted.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Bought this as a gift and he loves it!  You can't go wrong with the best television series in years!
B00A88FLI0|5.0|Bf's kid is happy = priceless! The product came in as is. In great condition. Will buy again from this vendor. Thanks so much!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Absolute garbage. I only read the first five chapters, and I was mad at myself for making it that far into the story. Any person who's actually an avid reader would probably think this is not worth a penny. Something tells me that this has been mostly enjoyed by women who barely ever pick up a book in their lives, who got excited that it's about sex. If you want a cheap thrill, you can read it (or save some time and just wait for the movie, which will probably be just as crappy).<br /><br />For real readers, I'd recommend to keep looking for something else. When you've had croissants in Paris, a stale pastry from a gas station convenience store won't cut it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Raises some very tough questions great for a book club discussion... I thoughts the characters were very well developed, and the book was well written. I ate it up in a few evenings!
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|I have been watching The Vampire Diaries since it began and look forward to seeing each episode, every Friday my family turns it on as soon as we can all watch it together!
B0014NDXGA|5.0|is very precise and accurate on distances less than 250 yds... a little trouble sighting anything longer...can't hit it that far anyway...
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The story is very relatable. I love how the main character, Charlie, speaks directly to the reader (or at least it feels that way). I was a wallflower too in middle school and high school, which made me be enamored with this book even more. It's very honest, very raw, poignant, genuine, and heartfelt. It's impossible to read this book and not love Charlie. I have been an avid reader all my life, and I can say he's become one of my most favorite characters of all time.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson has done it again! I can't wait to see what comes next for John and Kate! Paul and Cynthia should be interesting too!
B00005JKGZ|5.0|The best movie that Judy Garland ever made after \\"The Wizard of Oz\\". I'll defend that statement to-my-death. Great story, songs, costumes and sets. Superior to both \\"Harvey Girls\\" and \\"Summer Stock\\". Good transfer. As usual, the 2nd disc is sort of unnecessary, but does have better extras than most. A very good and sharp transfer with restored sound as well.
B00BUVPIRS|3.0|I had wanted this app for months, when I finally got it I played for hours untill I met the snow wolves..I ran into a building and  it saved, so when ever I try to leave I die in seconds. Over all great graphics and a nice story line and gameplay.
0843178388|5.0|My son and I cannot get enough of the books in this series. They are so cute and touch on certain behaviors and explore all emotions. Highly recommend these books to everyone.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|Having enjoyed, but not loved Reborn and Murder By Pride (both had exceptional songs on them, but getting past the production was a problem for me), I was a little skeptical about the hype on this newest record, but WOW(!), this is an actual return to form.  I've recently heard the latest Queensryche (the one w/ Todd La Torre), and was floored by it as well, and also the latest Dokken and recent Ratt records.  ALL of these bands have returned to the styles we love them for, and for those of us who's musical tastes were formulated during heyday of hair metal... man, this is like a revisit to 1986, except in some cases possibly even a bit better!  Anyway, of all of the above listed bands' most recent albums, Stryper's has the most impact, in my opinion.  We have clear, shiny 80's-style production with lots of screams, lots of major chords to offset the minors, and a whole record worth of glorious, pure Stryper-ized heavy metal.  I was texting friends last night, raving over the thing.  And yes, there is one ballad, but it's heads and shoulders above any of the piano ballads of the old days.  This is a guitar-based ballad with a backing vocal that reminds me of &#34;Indian Summer&#34;, by TNT, for whatever reason.  Miles above &#34;Honestly&#34; or &#34;Together As One&#34;.  The rest of the album is one smoker after another.  It's a heavy one for Stryper, as well.  One song in particular, &#34;Marching Into Battle&#34; is built around a chuggy, punky, thick rhythm that calls to mind that old song &#34;The Small Hours&#34;, by Holocaust and/or Metallica.  Oh, and I won't spoil things for anyone by revealing too much detail, but trust me, there are plenty of OTT rockers on here in the tradition of &#34;The Reign&#34;, and &#34;More Than A Man&#34;, too.  I really can't say enough about the record, but advise fans to just buy it.  It's worth every penny.
B0001NBMEE|4.0|It's great fun. Totally historically  inaccurate King Arthur costumer. Rousing musical score, like \\"Robin Hood\\" from the 1940's. You gotta love the \\"horns\\" on those Viking helmets and those really bad page-boy wigs on the squires! Looks like Doris Day's hair! Basically, a live-action comic strip. Robert Wagner plays Valiant in an unintentionally funny way. A plus: the exteriors are real English (or Scottish) castles. The video transfer is surprising mediocre.  No extras on disc to speak of. Pale blue skies and weak, muddy colors. Still has one of the best fiery battle scenes of all-time for a B+ movie. I love those pigskin-filled \\"fire-bombs\\" that get launched on the Vikings, like giant water-balloons.
B004YXE438|5.0|Don't want to stop playing.  Like the way you have chance to choose you level and number of pieces.<br />Also the hep when you are really stuck.
0399159347|5.0|While this novel has many characters to grasp, the attention to them is worth the effort.  This is a well-plotted story that really comes together.  Very believable.
B00ADQPB50|5.0|This is the first time I actually purchased a season of any show.  This is/was totally worth it.  The packaging was professional as was the delivery.
B002GSXKN8|4.0|A cheap way to update my VHS Batman collection to DVD. However, I have always disliked the old double-sided DVD as it is harder to keep the top side dust and scratch / fingerprint free.  No extras to speak of except for film fact &#34;slides&#34;.  Least liked film of the 4 remains &#34;Batman Returns&#34;. Catwoman is purr-fect but Danny Devito's &#34;Penguin&#34; is still disturbing, although well-done.  Christopher Walken is an unneeded third villain after &#34;Killing&#34; Serena after throwing her out of the window. Batman forever, although too campy, is still the best film in the (old) series, but ya gotta love The Joker in &#34;Batman&#34; as well.
B00C4U9U4Q|5.0|In an interview, Charli said her music is &#34;pop with substance.&#34; I 100 percent agree. This album is one of those where you don<br />t feel the urge to skip any songs...it's THAT amazing. I'm seeing Charli XCX live in Orlando Florida next week and I can't wait to see her live. Her music is orgasmic to my ears and soul. I like that she writes her own material and even writes for artists like Icona Pop and now Britney. Charli isn't very well known like Ellie Goulding right now but should be with the quality music she creates.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|Susan Boyle has a beautiful voice.  On this CD she sings Christmas songs alone or duets with some well known male singers, even Elvis!
0385349947|5.0|A good book for any girl to read.  It's very practical and encouraging.  The author has been quite honest about her experience in many situations. She's such an inspiration to girls.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I had trouble getting it to load on my Kindle Fire. I finally just uninstalled it. I never did get a chance to play the game since I'm not a patient person and waiting for it to load was just too time consuming.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|Cher is back! Great new album that is classic and new all at the same time. If you love Cher. you will love this album.
B00GINENG0|5.0|This is a great adition to the free Outfit 7 clan. It is wicked cute and I am surprised it doesn't cost money. Really fun!
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I love this show. The stories are inventive. The characters are amazing... just quirky enough to be really interesting. In general, a whole lot of fun. I missed the last two seasons so I was very excited to find the entire series among the prime offerings. I love Prime already!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Top movie in my opinion.  I bet the follow on will not be as good.  But for the price, you cannot go wrong in having this in your library if you have one.  Watch this from time to time on a wide screen HDTV and that is where it shines.
B00D5LC4GY|5.0|It's a pretty fun puzzle game. I play it every once in a while and haven't gotten tired of it. Simple design and addictive as well.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is a really fun game. Nice graphics and best of all you can hunt without killing (or injuring) REAL animals! Fun
B009X2CRMK|5.0|Clever writing that takes you on a journey through generations in what could be described as  &#34; in time machine&#34; format.  As the story unfolds it takes you back and forth across time and place unraveling piece by piece a mystery that links generations of unique characters to solve a modern day mystery.  There's no putting this book down for too long!
B004EPZ07U|3.0|Though sometimes silly, it was enjoyable never the less.  Seen better, and much worse, such as the new Superman movie that disappointed me, and wished I had not purchased it.  This one I can watch again.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I liked the well-researched, nicely dissected examples in The Power of Habit. I've read other books about habits, but this gives you the simple tools to understand and manipulate personal or organizational (family or corporate) habits: identify and experiment with cues, routines, and rewards. Or create a keystone habit that will affect all your routines and results. Want a habit makeover? I gave this book a high rating because it teaches how to achieve a habit makeover—with some work.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|better than the movie! excellent writing and narrating one of the biggest endeavors in this century.  My husband wanted it, but I read it before him.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|After reading many online reviews and trying a fair number of headphones, I chose these. They have sound excellent. They are nicely adjustable and the ear cushions are comfortable. I like the fact that the majority of the parts are self serviceable and replaceable.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Good movie, but wished it were a bit longer.  Could have been written a bit better as well, but the actors did a good job for the most part except that silly (Punk looking) rock lover that just did not fit in this movie.  Couldn't figure out why the alien (Humanoid) wanted to wipe out earths people after engineering them many moons past, and that was the part that was confusing, and perplexing to me, and why they did not succeed or why they did not continue, but that's hollywood for ya...
B00G32OER4|4.0|Great horror for the money! The presentation of the spirits was especially creepy. Ghosts are one of my favorite ways to be scared. Loved it!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|publicity made buy this poorly written book.  The story has set women back a few years, spineless, insecure &#34;girl&#34; meets sadist unbalanced millionaire.  If this is good literature, I give up.
0061122416|5.0|A fabulous book and compelling read. I refuse to tell you what happens. I leave that to others. Suffice to say that if your life has brought you to its cover, you owe it to yourself to dive in.
B00942G4UA|5.0|Great info-Really tells the Honest True story of farming, distribution, feed lots and what is fed to hogs, cattle and chickens.
B00006G8HX|3.0|Having finally re-watched this movie for the first time in a couple decades, I have to admit that it didn't age very well.  A lot of the scenes that I remembered as dramatic and moving come off a little too cheesy, and a lot of the special effects (particularly the representation of the Genesis planet, but other things as well) just look cheap.  While the films that bookend this one, &#34;Wrath of Khan&#34; and &#34;Voyage Home&#34; are low-budget Star Trek films that still manage to look pretty good and have held up over the years, &#34;Search for Spock&#34; is a low-budget Star Trek film that hasn't.  It's still an enjoyable movie, but you have to have a much higher suspension of disbelief to buy into this one.  And what's with Kirk just casually destroying the Enterprise?  In any previous TV show or movie he would have found a way out, but here when backed into a corner, he immediately decides to self-destruct?  That's the best the script writers could come up with?<br /><br />As for the bonus features on the second disc of the Special Collector's Edition - I haven't finished watching them all yet, but nothing has really stood out and made me glad I bought the collector's edition.  Particularly bad is the &#34;Terraforming&#34; feature, which theoretically is tied to the movie by a discussion of the technical and ethical aspects of the Genesis project, but which quickly goes off topic and becomes  20+ minute discussion of how we should terraform Mars.  It's OK if you enjoy that sort of thing, but it really has nothing to do with the movie.<br /><br />All in all, I'm glad I bought the movie in order to have a complete collection of the original cast films, but I'm also glad I didn't pay full price for it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great Fun!!<br /><br />Love the challenge, trying to beat the clock or strategic moves to get to the next level.<br />I am over 70 and I like to think this game will help my eye, hand and memory abilities!
0321898648|5.0|This is a very comprehensive look at getting Aperture 3 working for me.  So far it has been worth the effort to go throughout the tutorial.
B007ME5BUG|1.0|Very seldom in selecting a book have I found the few dissenting 1 Star opinions to be accurate, however in this case of Beevor's work I agree.<br />In agreement with another review this book should be titled \\"How Brittain Won the War Despite American Incompetence\\".
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|What a great read !  Good to revisit Clanton, and Jake and Carla Brigance.  A gripping book with a nail-biting but thoroughly satisfying end.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've given the hunger games five stars simply because it has that one element, the element that says that this story is something else, that is is not just a comedy or romance or drama or action and adventure, when in reality it is all of them combined beautifully into one story and once you finish it, along with the next two, you won't look at anything in the same way ever again.
0446573027|5.0|This is the first of two John Puller novels by David Baldacci. An army special investigator travels to a small Vest Virginia town to investigate the mysterious murder of an army officer and his family. While working with a knowledgeable female police officer, he begins to unravel a sinister plot that that could have nationwide repercussions. The second Puller novel, &#34;The Forgotten&#34;, contains several references to the events of Zero Day.
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|That's my absolute favorite movie! Everything (the story, the actors, the jokes, everything fits my humor! Unfortunately there is no further season ;-(
B000FC13UE|4.0|This book has several of my favorite short stories (Chivalry, Troll Bridge, The Price)  and introduced me to some new ones (Murder Mysteries, We Can Get Them For You Wholesale). This may be a good introduction to Gaiman. He has a way with words that entertains as well as intrigues.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|Update the game already! New maps and vehicles have been out for over a month now!  Love the game but it would be nice to get the new content!
B00CVPAZH0|4.0|After reading some Jack Reacher novels, I have a little difficulty relating Tom Cruz to the character described in the Lee Child series. The story and action are first rate and retain some of the lethal personality of the Reacher character. I would have preferred an actor along the lines of a mature Clint Eastwood to play Reacher.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Haven't had the app long enough to decide how I feel about it. Right now, I'm just barely liking it. I don't think the graphics are as good as some of the hidden mystery apps.
1476729085|5.0|This book is original and just has me laughing out loud (something rare for me in the privacy of my own home).  For a light-hearted read after a stressful day, this book is the perfect prescription!  It's extremely creative and I'm just loving it.
1250038820|5.0|There are no words that describe how much I love this book. Was so excited when I received it!! Love it so much. FAVOURITE BOOK!! Thank you
0446572985|5.0|This is the first of two Baldacci novels featuring sniper Will Robie. It skillfully weaves a story of an enigmatic man with complex and conflicting ideals. After he is framed for an illegal execution, he becomes involved with a street smart teen and a wily FBI Agent who dramatically change his life. After finishing this action yarn, you will be drawn to &#34;The Hit&#34;, another Robie thriller.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham does not dissapoint.  A master story teller, he takes the dullest possible premise--a will contest--and turns it into a crisp and gripping thriller--right to the very end.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It was as happy of an ending any story set in Germany during that time could achieve with shining examples of goodness to counter the hatred and devastation.<br />I won't watch the movie as my heart is broken quite enough
B003XVYLDU|2.0|The book was easy to read, interesting, cynical, funny and very awkward. The book is about Billy Pilgrim who has quite the life. He's been in World War 2, abducted by aliens, survived a plane crash and time travels. Kurt Vonnegut does a terrible job of thoroughly expressing his main points of the book: fate, how war is often unnecessary and grotesque.<br /><br />If you're a fan of cynicism and science fiction you'll like this book, if not you'll be lost. Very difficult to understand and comprehend. This book could be recommended to college students and science fiction fans. Entertaining and interesting, but confusing. I am wondering how this book is considered a classic and must read. It's interesting and entertaining, but somewhat nonsensical.
B0086449YA|5.0|Great lyrics on this album.  Lots of songs about sailing, truck driving and the freedom of motion.  &#34;Used to Could&#34; is my favorite.  I am singing it with my band because it is in my range.
B00FAPU0UK|5.0|When I heard Charity and Regina were writing stories together, I knew it would be a great match for sexy-scary-fun!  I read, Bedroom Games and loved the combo of writings!!!  The thing about this story is the sex with scary/stuff going on...  AND THEN THE FREAKIN ENDING!!!  LOLOLOL  It's a thrilling read that pays big in the end.  I LOVED the ending!!!  I aint sayin' nothin else!!!<br /><br />:-D
B00BUT5I84|5.0|This album is one of their best.  I really like 3STM's music.  I like their sound and Jared's voice, but I'm beginning to become a little uncomfortable with some of their lyrics and imagery.  They seem to want to push a certain agenda.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|My only &#34;issue&#34; with this is that I wish each DVD had its own individual case, instead of one big case for them all
006202406X|2.0|I didn't realize that there was some unspoken rule that indicated a Young Adult book MUST have a happy ending. But apparently that's what most of the reviews on Amazon seem to think. The author can and should do whatever pleases them and not to say it shouldn't affect the readers (it does) but it amazes me how people seem to think it's all about them and their feelings. No, this series does not end happily. For a number of reasons. But how utterly boring and predictable would it have been if things had gone exactly to plan? I was actually surprised by what happened. It caught me off guard but I applaud the author for doing what she did because in hindsight, it was probably the best course to take.<br /><br />Now, that said, this is the least entertaining book in the Divergent series. It's overly long and quite dull in a few areas. There is lots of talking, not much doing, and aside from the plot twist near the end, the climax was a let-down. The mystery surrounding the first two books gets dissolved here, but not in any inspiring way. We don't really get much that left us surprised or on the edge of our seats.<br /><br />Tobias, AKA Four was an interesting character back in Book 1, but here he's dragging his feet, moping the whole book and doing really nothing of interest or importance. Tris spends the book feeling either agitated or guilty and she can't seem to reconcile her feelings. The secondary characters don't provide much curiosity or entertainment. The whole mood of this book differs greatly from the other two. It almost doesn't feel part of the Divergent series. It's hard to explain unless you read it, but that's the way I felt through the whole book.<br /><br />All in all I was disappointed. Not at the way it ended, but the journey to the end. It was a sad, tired sort of ending, but it left me feeling empty and wanting more.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is the 25th time for reading this book. I cannot stop. This is the most romantic love story. There is so much going on between Christian and Anastasia, so many first with them. This book is not about just sex, it's a true love story. I can't wait for the movie, I hope Mrs. James continue their story. I would have rated the book higher if there were more stars.  gloriahall98@gmail.com Each time I read, I read the triology.
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|This is my daughters new favorite game.  Fun and easy to pick up for younger children.  More words are required.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Good games and very enjoyable the only complaints would be that shield regeneration is lacking and the occasional freeze of screen .
B00ADQPA38|5.0|love it! This is a wonderful show keep them coming! Jessica just keeps getting better and better every season! Yea!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This is quite possibly the worst book I have ever read. The first two books in the trilogy were okay, but not great; this one, however, was a depressing and idiotic close to the series.
B000H1RFKU|4.0|An all time favourite - really enjoyed the plot development. The interaction between Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington was totally real.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|The walking dead is one of my favorite shows! It is filled with a lot of suspense and leaves you hanging at the edge of your seat!
B00FPH6M82|2.0|This film was just not that great. I think Will Smith has had much better productions. I like his son but didn't think he pulled off the character. Story was predictable.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Really good book,kept me interested throughout. Hope it comes out in movie.  It'll be great. I recommend is book to anyone interested in the legal system.
B00FHATBGW|4.0|I really enjoy this game because it's a nice common sense game. Finding the clues is easey and its worth the money. I think everyone should try it.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|One of those books that everyone should read, it just reinforce a lot of what I already believe. Thank you Anita for sharing your story.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Easy to read and get into. Interesting how the three main characters stories are intertwined. I had no idea how the book was gonna end.
B00826B65M|5.0|I once knew a woman who read the complete &#34;Comćdie humaine&#34; every year. However she did it it would have been easier if she had had a Kindle and this wonderful work, but it was 1966. This great classic is a bit overwhelming, but it is possible to get great pleasure by just wending one's way through it -- wandering through a fascinating world.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|My family loves the Castle series. This DVD is a birthday gift to introduce Castle to a friend who enjoys murder mysteries with a love interest between the main characters who solve the mystery.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|This is a heartfelt movie.  It brings out the best in people even when they are not always positive.  I love the music and the smiles it puts on peoples faces.
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|Great movie, sometimes a bit over the top but overall good. Great effects, good action. Acting was average most of the time.
B002RKRGQ2|5.0|One of the classics of light English literature. It is immediately clear why Wodehouse is considered to be one of the masters of English prose. &#34;Right Ho&#34; opens with a little vignette that is quickly interrupted by a philosophical disquisition on the difficulties of beginning to tell a story. It takes about 50 words to have the reader giving way to warm chuckles -- not belly laughs, not rolling on the floor giggles, but serious, reflective, humorous fun.
1400069289|4.0|Great read that gives plenty of quality examples to show how habits are ingrained into everything we do. And how we can change the habits we don't like.
B003VS0CXS|4.0|Allways a good story.  Fun for families to enjoy.  Good quality.  Getting it to use on Blu-ray and DVD was a bonus.
B004SIP9U6|5.0|The movie is charming and funny, and true or 'true,' it's a fun time with what you can only hope Shakespear might have been like.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A fitting end to the series. Peeta and Katniss ending up together in the end makes for a perfect ending.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Great series, had to watch back to back a lot. Very engaging with quality acting and evolving plot. Video quality is good too.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|worth the 99 cents. This would require some kind of prequel to justify it. Pitt is really the only good thing about this film.
0307730697|5.0|First of all, Eric Blehm is a great author.  He does a great job drawing readers into his stories.  Second, Adam Brown was an amazing man, father, warrior, American and Christian.  I appreciate how Blehm provides glimpses of each of these facets of Brown's life without making any mutually exclusive.<br /><br />Excellent read, highly recommendable!
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|Too many special effects, Not enough talented acting. Plus, I grew up with Sean Connery as Bond. Hard to get past the bias.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|I love these games by BIG FISH. I can hardly wait to play the next part two to &quot;The Keepers: Lost Progeny. I have quite a few of your games. Enjoyed them all. Keep up the good work on making more games.
B0058EA3MS|5.0|This 2010 film has the usual Leigh hallmarks -- detailed attention to ordinary lives, an absence of melodrama, a strong ensemble cast, and an emotional force that is not diminished by the focus on the everyday.  All the performances are fine, but Lesley Manville's portrayal of the needy and near-alcoholic Mary is particularly noteworthy, for she is the source of the tension in the film and a weak performance in that role would have been very damaging.  Mary's needs are acknowledged and to a certain extent enabled by Tom and Gerri, a married couple nearing retirement age.  He is a geologist, she a counselor at a clinic.  We first see Gerri dealing with a client, played by the great Imelda Staunton in a cameo, who is rendered mute by unhappiness.  We never see Staunton again, but a mood has been set, and although Mary is as garrulous as Staunton's character is uncommunicative, we see throughout the film the texture of her unhappiness too.  She is divorced and needs connection (and would like a man in her life), and we see how Tom's and Gerri's kindness to her leads her to see herself almost as part of their family (with pathetic designs on their son, who is considerably younger than she is), until in the final section of the movie a line is crossed and boundaries, hitherto tacit, are made explicit.<br /><br />The movie is divided into four sections, each corresponding to a season, and in the first three Mary's interactions with Tom and Gerri are as an invited guest  (she works as a receptionist at the clinic where Gerri works, and they have known each other for twenty years).  A pretense is kept up in these social gatherings that Mary is moving towards independence and a fuller life, although Mary's white wine consumption and occasional drunken laments let us see how empty the likelihood of independence and maturity is for her.  Her disappointments with her new (to her) car -- a symbol of her sense of herself as beginning a new life bravely -- and with the fact that Tom and Gerri's son gets a girlfriend are painful to watch, but the writing is so good throughout that we never feel that the characters communicate with one another in a way that isn't credible.<br /><br />The \\"Winter\\" section of the movie is a genuine climax, notwithstanding Leigh's resolute eschewal of overstatement or drama.  In the interest of not giving too much away, I will only say that here a boundary is crossed and things need to be said that Gerri perhaps hoped she would never have to say -- not that her saying them is \\"explosive\\" or obviously climactic.  But it's in that final section that Mary, at her most pathetic, also has her finest hour, for what it's worth.  Tom's recently widowed brother Ron is staying with the family, and Mary comes to the house not knowing that he's there and at a time when Tom and Gerri are out.  From the moment that Ron opens the door until Tom's and Gerri's return, the interaction of Mary and Ron is absolutely riveting -- literally suspenseful.  The dialogue between them, which is pretty minimal, shows us Mary as we haven't quite seen her before but in a way that is utterly consistent with what we have seen.  This is acting on a very high level from both Manville and David Bradley, who plays Ron.<br /><br />By the end nothing is resolved, and yet both we and the characters know and understand things we didn't know earlier.  And to be fair to the other actors, all of them show, as the movie goes on, characters who have the capacity to surprise us.  All that need to be added is that the cinematography is unobtrusively excellent, and the music catches the melancholy that is an important facet of the story but by no means the only one.om and Gerri's son gets a girlfriend are painful to watch, but the writing is so good throughout that we never feel that the characters communicate with one another in a way that isn't credible.<br /><br />The \\"Winter\\" section of the movie is a genuine climax, notwithstanding Leigh's resolute eschewal of overstatement or drama.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can't help but come back again and again I must beat each level. Love the effects when I combine the special candies. Real fun game.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|this game is awesome I play it every day I would play this game if u like to laugh and have a good time
0385528787|5.0|This was a satisfying ending to a great series. Margaret Atwood did not pull any punches with this book. At times it is pretty brutal but then so is the world that characters are living in. I was happy that she ended the story without out any questions. The characters arcs were wrapped up and it felt complete to me.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Just finished it....absolutely HATED it. What a waste! I feel betrayed...I feel bummed...I feel so incredibly disappointed.  I'd rather this book end at the end of book two, than THIS.<br />It was such a waste. People died and it was stupid and pointless. The villians just GAVE UP their evil ways and wandered off into the sunset, or whatever. Stupid.<br />And I now I just want to move on and forget I ever read this stupid book...I'll certainly never read it again. It's not even worth the time to write out all the 1000 and 1 reasons I didn't like it.<br />A vial of memory serum should be included with this book, so you can take it when you get to the last page.
B005V5WBFG|5.0|I love McAfee, have it on my personal computer at home; plus we use it as part of our security at work.
1250038820|5.0|I love the stories behind the people. This book really gives you a sense of connectedness to everyone. It makes you stop and see a stranger as someone who  has a story and life beyond what you're seeing at that moment.
0786962984|5.0|This was a gift for a teenage boy and it was a hit. It is a fairly simple game but surprisingly fun to play.
B00DZV15FU|2.0|I finally finished it! It took me five tries to get to the end of it, but I did and I am very glad that I stuck it out. And, I have read plenty of \\"classic\\" literature from Robinson Crusoe, Dracula, Moby Dick, David Copperfield, etc.  This book is a slow moving novel with sparks of humor here and there, but I really still don't see the reason huge numbers of people are so captivated by it.. Taking the story out of the book and making a movie out it seems the best treatment. Some of the characters were so insipid that I wanted to slap them across the face, but others were thoroughly complex and interesting. I think I was able to finish it finally because I read it after reading The House of the Seven Gables, Jane Eyre, Agnes Grey, and the The Tenant of Wildfell Hall all in a row, back to back. Out of these five novels, I would put Pride and Prejudice last, only barely beat out by Jane Eyre. The Anne Bronte books and Hawthorne are much better books, are much more enjoyable to read and have a clearer and more direct story line.
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|A real action movie. From start to finish ALL ACTION. No stupid sub-plots or love stories. Just action. Real Dredd
B00F35BV64|3.0|i'm a big star trek fan, but i didn't like this. don't know if it was bad or if i 'm getting old, just a lot of pointless action.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A wonderful thriller. I read it because so many people kept leaving reviews complaining about the ending so I wanted to see what the fuss was all about. I loved it. Ms Flynn is a great writer and this novel kept my attention from beginning to end. Wickedly awesome dialog as well.
B008469DGY|4.0|VERY fun golf game, though I do wish it played more like a regular game of golf instead of a home run derby of sorts. Great graphics and easy play.
030758836X|3.0|I like the way the story is told, the &#34;he said&#34; vs. &#34;she said&#34; format is interesting and new. The language is vulgar, but so are the characters, at times. Flynn tells the story well; I just don't feel like the resolution was well done.<br />For me, the story begs a few questions: Are sociopaths born or bred, and wouldn't psychologists have a clue about their own child? What's the real relationship potential for a couple like Nick and Amy? Does Nick's dissection of his own psyche in one of the short/late chapters sound plausible? Can you really buy a stolen car on Craigslist (with plates)? Is Missouri really that ugly and depressing (no, no, no!)? Did the North Carthage police department really botch this case (hmmm... I didn't feel they did)? Why call this town North Carthage when Missouri already has a Carthage (just me wondering how this idea came to fruition)? Is it believable that Nick and Boney could not think of one way to rig a wire tap and catch Amy in a damning statement (aren't cell phones made to record sneaky stuff like that)? Don't all hotels/cabin rentals ask for your drivers license when you book a room?<br />Ok, those are my issues with the story. If you read it, plan for a fun ride, but an anticlimactic ending.
B00A2H9PLG|1.0|Worst movie ever. Not only was the acting bad but Chatham kept his clothes on the entire movie. There were 1 or 2 funny lines in the movie but overall the acting was poor ans the story line totally unbelievable. If you want to see a better one, chose Olympus has Fallen.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This Accuweather app works well on my Kindle Fire.  Has a nice weather display in color.  It has been very accurate on predicting the weather in my area.  I like it!
B00ENTDDGW|5.0|Good game - very fast paced and played just like the real-life version. Took me a sec to get used to keeping my finger in the right place so I didn't knock the puck into my own goal as often. :-)
B00355L2TU|5.0|My first experience with a Jillian Michaels DVD and I loved it.  Lost almost 12 pounds and about 15 inches.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I really loved this book, the writing is unique and very creative. The book's style as a history of the Zombie War brings the world to life and makes it utterly believable.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|This ebay app works fine on my Kindle Fire.  I still like my PC set up for ebay better.  This does OK in a pinch.
B00006I53S|1.0|Warning about lens creep true.  The lens would slide out anytime it was held downward.  I was immediately annoyed and returned the lens to get another thinking it was defective.  The second lens came with the same problem.  Pictures taken with the lens were decent, but I am returning a second time due to the lens creep.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|I thought this was supposed to be a comedy but it really wasn't.  The wife constantly whined, but at least the husband was likeable.  I really thought it would never end.
B0092EE5HY|3.0|A decent sci-fi, but lacks the force behind the Game of Thrones series. It's genuinely funny, but quickly degenerates into complete slap-stick, and Tuf's overly sophisticated speech pattern gets stale very quickly.
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|Really enjoyed Part One.  . . . and this sequel is even better!  Three very challenging levels with 75 game screens each level. Now only half way through Easy Level on Kindle Firenand already challenged! Highly recommend this game for match 3 fun.

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book explains everything really well and the experiments made a believer out of me. I would highly recommend this book.
1400034205|5.0|Such human tragedy - Somerset Maugham writes about loss, addictions, close relationships.  Maugham writes a superb novel. I I bought the book years back.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|The movie is great. fast shipping and was brand new as if bought from a official store. The only issue I have is that the blu-ray case is damage. The case is broken and does not close and the plastic that holds the movie in the center is broken. i have not contacted seller to replaced as my daughter loves the movie, its a great price and movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing candy crush. I have it on my computer, my smart phone and my kindle and I play it alot.

B002KKBVAQ|5.0|My kids received a kit for Christmas and since we've added additional kits.  My kids love &#34;building&#34; toys and this is right up their alley.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Thrilling to watch. Characters are interesting and show is well written. Each story keeps your interest and acting is well done.
B000QCS9NM|5.0|Choke was one of those books that seems disjointed at first, but as you continue reading you are drawn in, and by the end, all of the many threads of story line weave together creating a total fabric. There were many similarities in style to &#34;Fight Club&#34;, however, this was a book worth reading.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|I rate this 5 stars.  Not for non hidden gamers.  If you like to search and discover anxious my, then this game is for you!
0553386794|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. George Martin is a genius! Can't wait to read the next book in this series! Hope the TV series doesn't destroy what was created on these pages.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Entertaining and well-acted by Washington and the supporting cast.  I just didn't have much sympathy/empathy with his character for 95% of the film.
B00FVVR2ZO|4.0|I'm pretty much addicted to it. I sit and play for hours. I just wish they , gave you more diamonds, but I guess they wouldn't make money that way.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Small, portable way to get access to Netflix, etc on your tv via your iphone or ipad. Great price- $35!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|very nice book to change the way you look at the world. with utmost clarity she makes us to think
B003FSTN52|4.0|Great show we have been watching it now for all the seasons.  We love Felicia and and love to hate her hubby.  The characters are very well defined. It is a really great show.  I especially like to be able to watch with out commercials and see one show after another.
B00ECLU346|4.0|Very funny, although I enjoyed 1 & 2 more and found myself laughing out loud more the first two movies.
B00881VLCE|4.0|They r great fun,can choose how many pieces u want,I like having the option based on how busy I am
B008602KQI|4.0|It was a good movie...def'ly worth watching....  It has a creative story line / plot.  It also had a good amount of action, and the best part is it was not completely predictable.  Me and my 15 y/o son really enjoyed it.
076790592X|5.0|Its a &#34;mice and men&#34; type book. Or a &#34; To Kill a mocking bird &#34;. This is a must read for everyone a true literary gem. I highly recommend.
B00005JMX6|5.0|I got it because it is unrated...which I could not find anything extra in the movie that proved it was unrated...still I loved the movie. It is about Moral Fiber...and the ending is a surprise...just like the entire movie...great shots of the stars.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Great fast paced game this game is just as exciting as bejeweled blitz. I encourage you all to let your friends know about this game.
B008Y5T5ZE|5.0|Its a suspense and great entertainment movie.I like Depp and think he is a great actor.I have seen most of his movies and look forward to more,along this line of movies.
B0081336FO|5.0|This updated version of Sherlock is phenomenal.  The cast is superb; the writing divine, and the UK locations are spectacular.  Series 3 starts in January and I can't wait!
B008JFUPFI|4.0|Okay, okay, okay... I get it now.  I suppose after two years waiting for this to be released, I was bound to be overly critical.  Watching MAN OF STEEL again, I understand this movie better than before.  I'm much more open to admitting that there isn't really a definitive Superman in movies, or on TV, or even (pardon my herecy) in comic books.  When I first watched this movie, I felt like they had missed the point of what Superman was all about.  I couldn't wrap my head around certain actions Superman performed in the ending of this movie (I don't want to spoil anything) Re-watching this changed everything.  I feel I can understand Jor-el and his actions now.  Jonathan and Martha make more sense to me.  I actually like this movie now.  I highly recommend watching again ifyou were disappointed the first time.  I also think ( and this is HUGE) you should avoid the 3D version at all costs!!!  This movie gained NOTHING from 3D, in fact I think it made it worse.  Having watched the extra version on the blu-ray, I don't think Zack Snyder  meant this to be a 3D movie.  He never mentions it, and frankly, I wouldd think he wouldn't hesitate to point out 3D if the quality was up to snuff.  I am now looking forward to new Superman movies.  Bring them on!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|YOU, HAVE MILLION $ PEOPLE WHO ENJOY WORKING WITH PEOPLE & APPRECIATE WORKING FOR YOU.  THEY GO THE EXTRA MILE.  THEY LOOK FOR WORK WHEN THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO  RATHER THAN SIT ON THEIR HANDS.<br />JC PENNY IS PUTTING THE SMILE BACK IN THEIR STORES-YOU ARE TOO-WHAT A BLESSING
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Finally a good book by John Grisham.  I had just about given up on getting a good book from him.  But this one did it.  Do not start it unless you have plenty of time to read.
1439152810|5.0|When she was sixteen, living on her family’s farm outside of London, Laurel Nicolson saw her beloved mother committing the murder of a stranger. Although Laurel’s own testimony established that it was done in self defense, her parents never fully explained why it happened. Now Laurel, a successful actress, is in her 60′s, and her mother is dying. This is her last chance to discover the truth about this dark family secret.<br /><br />The Secret Keeper is wonderfully labrynthine novel, which, as it progresses through its various stages, is told and retold from the perspectives of three women. There is Laurel herself, speaking mostly in the present time, explaining things as she understood them then and how she interprets them now. Her mother, Dorothy, relates her own version of events as they unfolded during the Blitz in WWII. An alternate version is provided, also from 1940′s London, by Dorothy’s glamorous friend Vivian. All three are remarkably captivating individuals, and, every step of the way, author Morton surrounds them with an array of vibrant supporting characters. The bulk of the action takes place in wartime London, which comes alive in all the life and death peril of the bombings.<br /><br />Although some reviewers have remarked that the secret was a fairly easy one to guess, I was unable to figure everything out until close to the end. When the truth becomes apparent, it’s very bittersweet, and very satisfying. Having read all three of Kate Morton’s earlier books, I feel confident in describing her writing as literary, elegant and eloquent, and she creates memorable stories bursting with life. She’s a terrific novelist, well worth reading.
0316023744|5.0|If you are interested in a detailed account of the history of WWII then I suggest you read this book. Very detailed.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This is a fun game to have for killing some time.  I would say it is better than I expected it to be. I would suggest it for anyone looking for a time killer.
B000IHY9SE|5.0|I met a fine girl last night in the D<br />I got her to leave with a little weed and Hennesy
B004H4XDBI|5.0|Great series couldn't put it down! I read this series on vacation in Vegas by the pool and on the plane. Very captivating story line.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love SwiftKey. It's the best keyboard out there imo. I've tried many and nothing comes close. I love how I can get all the options I need right on the front without having to go to a punctuation/numbers screen. It knows my slang and predicts very well.
