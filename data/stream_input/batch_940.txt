B002JIOQCO|5.0|If you love the awesome power and creative energy of the early 70's, then this is a MUST have. Led Zeppelin/Black Sabbath/Yes/John Lennon-Beatles/Deep Purple make up driving force behind this disc. Better than the first WOLFMOTHER debut!!! EVERY song is a stand out.
B001AII4RM|5.0|I don't usually write reviews, but I thought this movie was being unfairly lambasted, so I decided to throw my 2 cents in.   I was not familiar with the original poem before seeing this movie in IMAX 3D. It was an amazing experience. I liked it so much that I had to have a copy for myself and so I bought the blu ray version.  Even without 3D the movie is still spectacular. Most of the bad reviews are angry at the movie's straying from the original \\"classic\\" version of the story. This should not be held against the writers. They managed to produce a thrilling spectacle that offers CGI at its most impressive. Angelina was breath-taking, the monsters were awesome, and the characters were quite individual and interesting. Definitely worth watching.
B002UXRH10|2.0|While she delivers her vocals in a wonderful plausible fashion the overall sound of the cd is very lacking. The sound of the cd is just not that good as I have listened to it on 3 different sound systems. Rihanna sounds like she is expressing her sadness and grief on this one which is important and enlightening to others in her age group. I hope she can get past her issues with her abuser and get back to her happy pop roots. Finding another producer for the next project might be helpful. thanks
B001AVCFK6|3.0|I liked it.  It was more like Back to the future for me.  I was not a big fan of the whole time travel idea.  I was more of a what if film.  If you forget ALL of the previous films or just treat it like a what if, you can enjoy the film.  I enjoyed it more as an action film with a sense of humor...Kind of like Die Hard.
1410420442|5.0|I'll admit after finishing the first book, I had no idea how she was going to continue. I should of trusted that she had an idea, and how she'd tell it would be even more thrilling than the first. Some critics have pointed out comparisons to the  Twilight trio, and I can't help but picture Kristen Stewart as the heroine Katmiss, but beyond that it's a totally different set of characters. The only similarity is two men and one woman. Collins takes the current story down one path, as rumors of uprisings are taking places in various districts, and Katmiss and Peeta seem to be the centerpiece of the rebellion. But in a flash The Capitol steps in the retaliate, and Katmiss finds herself back in the arena fighting for her life. Personally I liked the first book alot, but thought this was simply terrific.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I will return this CD.  Ripped it to puter, went to \\"recently added\\" and it shows as \\"artist unknown, title, unknown.\\"      I loved the CD, BTW.  I am really annoyed that CD does not identify on my Windows Media Player.    Oh, and for anyone who is interested, I also received the pre order of Lambert's new CD. That did not identify on my puter, either.  They are both going back to  Amazon.    Your input is appreciated.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Space, the final frontier... 5 of 5 stars for the Sci-Fi movie Star Trek. One day in 1966, I sat down in front of my B&W TV to watch a new TV program, Star Trek. I've been a fan ever since! We started with the original series (Kirk & Spock), then a series of movies and then various TV series which explored before and after the original series. This movie presents the Kirk & Spock era from kids to the formation of the original series crew of the Enterprise. Well, there is a twist! In the opening sequence, Kirk's dad dies as James T is born. Say what? That's not the original time line! Hummm... There are several \\"odd things\\" happening in this timeline (Spock and Uhura kissing?). It is all part of this story line.<br /><br />The movie is extremely interesting with a great plot! A really serious bad guy who has a really big ship he uses to \\"mine\\" planets. Oh, did I mention Spock \\"prime\\" (Leonard Nimoy) plays a key role? Truly great special effects from ILM. Very faithful to the original series and lots of eye candy for us fans (did you notice the tribble in the cage on Scotty's workbench?). Shout outs to: Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and Karl Urban (Kirk, Spock, McCoy) with each capturing the character without doing an \\"impression\\" of the original actors; respectful but not a carbon copy.<br /><br />I'd like to give this movie a 10 of 5 stars, but, they won't let me do that! So, it has been added to my official favorites list. I really hope some smart people out there will take this timeline and fresh cast and move forward with a new weekly TV series. We could call it the New Original Series!
0061537969|4.0|Every reader will love this story.  It is told from the perspective of a dog named Enzo.  The Author, Garth Stein, certainly tells this story with a canine sense of humor.  Enzo's lack of opposable thumbs and world view, as learned through television, make for an entertaining narrative.      To some degree, this story is also a nightmare.  Enzo's master, Denny, suffers a personal tragedy.  This tragedy is compounded by legal problems that are inflicted upon him through a perverse use of the justice system.  Denny's legal problems are nothing short of a horror story that will keep some readers awake at night.    Despite showing human behavior at its lowest and cruelest, the story still generates an overall positive feeling.  Enzo displays the kind of gentleness and human decency that is rarely found in people.  Ironically, the dog is more of a human being than the characters surrounding him and his master.  Bottom line:  this is both a heart warming and suspenseful read.
B002PTHKNY|1.0|My daughter suggested I listen to 'Just Breathe' and sent me the url.  The tears flowed as I listened to it and thought, \\"This man KNOWS Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).\\" and determined to buy the cd.    That said, I don't like the other songs or music...probably because I don't understand the words and appreciate it.  My kids listen to Pearl Jam, but years ago, I listened to their favorite bands long enough to know I didn't like what they called music.    I rate the one song, \\"Just Breathe\\" 5 stars and perhaps shouldn't rate the others on the cd, but, to be fair, I truthfully don't like them -- I'm only interested in \\"Just Breathe.\\"    I bought the cd for the one song, highly recommend it and would buy it again.  Now, if someone can tell me how to erase the other songs from the cd and keep \\"Just Breathe\\"...? :)
B002QGUFWE|5.0|Lady Gaga is everywhere now compared to a year ago, and I really think she deserves it, her music is great. This album is great to sing along to, and dance to, you can have a lot of fun listening to Lady Gaga. If you are sad, and then listen to this album you will be happy again, she makes my day. I really enjoyed The Fame, a lot so I am glad she released The Fame Monster the different side of her which is great. I love her lyrics. This is a have to have album of 2009. Lady Gaga reminds me of Madonna, Britney Spears, and Gwen Stefani all mixed into one musician. Lady Gaga is very talented, and I hope she is around just as long as Madonna has been.
0375701427|5.0|The people giving this a negative review are missing the point.  I don't blame them.  I did too, until I thought about it enough.  I'm a big Roth fan.  I've read at least half his novels.  I was initially disappointed with this one and set out to write a \\"the emperor has no clothes\\" type  of review, but as I organized my thoughts, they slapped me upside the head.  Roth was striving for, and achieved a fantastic irony.  This is a tremendous literary novel if you're the type who likes to think, \\"So what was that REALLY all about?\\" but it will leave you cold if you're just looking for an engrossing story you don't have to think too hard about.    Here's a paragraph I started to write, before the light bulb went on:      Think of the Pulitzer for this book as more of a lifetime achievement award.  It's a meaty book, about important themes.  It makes you think.  It looks back wisely on a pivotal time in America.  The Swede is a memorable protagonist.  There's a lot of really good stuff here that fits in great with Roth's body of work.  But in the end, I couldn't shake the feeling that any decent editor would have sent any author not named Philip Roth back for a substantial rewrite.  As many others have mentioned, Roth abandons the Zuckerman first person narration about a third the way in, telling you as he does that he'll be inventing all the parts he doesn't actually know.  And it nagged in my head the rest of the way that the original narrator told me he's just making it up.  Very unsatisfying.  That confession kicked me out of the narrative dream, and I could never get back into it.  I pondered for a long time over whether I was missing a greater point, and scoured other reviews just to be sure.  Nah.  Unless he's striving for ULTIMATE irony, cranking out \\"modern art\\" just for the grins of seeing it praised for all the things he knows it isn't    I stopped before putting a period on that last sentence, looked at what I had written, and started laughing out loud.  There's a character in the book, Orcutt, who assumes a larger and larger role until he plays a pivotal part in the climax.  Or anticlimax, if you prefer.  Orcutt churns out highly praised, costly crap he calls modern art, unfinished-looking blurs that lend themselves to comic descriptions by intelligentsia too proud of their own reputations to admit they don't know what the hell they're looking at.  Highly reminiscent of all the people who told the emperor how great his new threads look.    Can you say metaphor?  Roth deliberately left this one unfinished just to crack up at the gushing reviews he knew would come for a work that wasn't everything the reviewers say it is.        One thing I haven't seen elsewhere, although I'm sure it's out there somewhere, is that once he switches to straight third person narration, he slips briefly - for a page or so - into first person narration as the Swede.  You've got Zuckerman narrating in the first person, then it moves to third person, then the Swede briefly in first person, then back to third.  As I read it, I felt like it was too cute, that Roth was saying, \\"I'm such a genius, I can pull this off and hardly anyone will notice.\\"  It detracted from the story and focused me on the writing.  And all the while, I kept thinking, well, this is the great Philip Roth.  It couldn't possibly be an accident, an editing error.  Could it?    I kept waiting for Zuckerman to come back in in the first person and tie up all the loose ends and explain that inconsistency, and many others, but the book ends without that.      The emperor does have no clothes, but the emperor is not Roth, it's the book itself, and all the reviewers who missed the irony.  Well done, sir.
B0026P3G12|4.0|Like most of the known world I fell in love with Susan Boyle when I saw her sing I Dreamed A Dream on YouTube.. And I suppose it was as much for her sassy, in-your-face attitude toward the judges as it was for her stunning rendition of the song.. Goosebumps don't lie and she certainly gave several million people a hardy set of those with her performance..<br />I could hardly wait until her first album came out and quickly pre-ordered mine from Amazon, which came to my front door yesterday.. Since I was heading for my friend's house, who lives some distance away, I was tickled pink to get the CD before I left and couldn't wait to listen to it in the car..<br />As Susan's lovely voice floated out of my car's speakers I was in seventh heaven.. It was as thrilling as I remembered, if not more so.. Although her range isn't large it certainly is pure and the goosebumps returned quickly..<br />When the CD finished I replayed it and, while still loving her voice, I realized the layout and choices for the CD left me a bit flat.. I found little cohesion at all in the songs picked for the album.. Why start with Wild Horses? Why end with a damn Christmas Carol? The whole line-up was a hodge-podge of disparate pieces that, in no way, should have been brought together..<br />I would love to see Susan produce a great collection of torch songs like Cry Me A River, The Man I love, Stormy Weather or Black Coffee but sticking Cry Me A River in an album along with Amazing Grace and How Great Thou Art just didn't cut it for me..<br />I'm looking forward to her next CD and can only hope it will be one that produces a selection of songs that go well together, that follow a specific genre.. Susan is a great singer but Sony, her album producer, should be ashamed of pushing out this CD in order to make money.. Susan is a true artist and her first CD should have been created to reflect that.. Thankfully, she rose above this poorly designed album and did a splendid job of making it worthwhile..

B000V8I2QU|5.0|After spending much of the 1990s' adopting a new low key Dylan-esque persona, Bruce Springsteen reunited the E Street Band and released the September 11th inspired \\"The Rising.\\" Though a solid album with some of the absolute greatest songs he has ever written (the title song, \\"Lonesome Day, \\"My City of Ruins,\\" \\"Nothing Man\\"), it was bogged down with too much filler and could've been a good 7-8 songs shorter and been a much better album. (Amazing tour, though.)<br /><br />Fast forward five years later, and Bruce and the E Street Band finally deliver the return to form fans have been longing for since the band reunited. \\"Magic\\" is, top to bottom, an excellent album, and Bruce's most consistently satisfying record since \\"Tunnel of Love.\\"<br /><br />The opening number, the frenetic \\"Radio Nowhere,\\" makes it apparent from the beginning that the boys are back, as all the key elements are there for a modern Springsteen classic: a strong riff and hook, a powerful vocal from Bruce, potent, throught provoking lyrics, and the raggedly riotously vocal backings of Little Steven.<br /><br />The rest of the album is loaded with similar quality gems: the jangly Birds inspired rockers \\"You'll Be Coming Down\\" is a sonic marvel. Clarence Clemons makes the eerie \\"Living in the Future\\" a funky, fun \\"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out\\" esque romp despite its heavy handed political commentary. \\"Gypsy Biker\\" features some of the best E Street guitar work ever. And Roy Bittan shows why, musically speaking, he is the most integral force in the E Street Band, turning in a stunning performance on the beautiful \\"I'll Work for Your Love.\\"<br /><br />But it's Bruce who's the real star here. His writing is as strong and relevant as ever, and his vocals are on the money. One thing he has not lost sight of is his ability to write a thought provoking political song that touches the heart and inspires the mind with its bluntness and relevance. On this album, it is its final numbers that pull off this feat. \\"Long Walk Home\\" is an out and out Bruce classic, bristling with the idealism of \\"Thunder Road,\\" the atmsphere of \\"The River,\\" the boldness of \\"Born in the U.S.A,\\" and the hope of \\"Born to Run.\\" The album's closer, \\"Devil's Arcade,\\" is as much an anthem for Iraqi War veterans as \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" was for Vietnam, a poignant, heartbreaking tale of the sacrifices soldiers make and the lost hope and dreams they never see fulfilled.<br /><br />The one major complaint about the record is the production - Bruce needs to can Brendan O'Brien and get Little Steven back behind the mixing board. The wall of sound smothers much of the more subtle musical touches. Other than that, however \\"Magic\\" is an essential masterpiece in the Bruce Springsteen canon.ruce classic, bristling with the idealism of \\"Thunder Road,\\" the atmsphere of \\"The River,\\" the boldness of \\"Born in the U.S.A,\\" and the hope of \\"Born to Run.\\" The album's closer, \\"Devil's Arcade,\\" is as much an anthem for Iraqi War veterans as \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" was for Vietnam, a poignant, heartbreaking tale of the sacrifices soldiers make and the lost hope and dreams they never see fulfilled.

B002X1ZEPA|5.0|This is the best album I have heard this year, and I truly encourage everyone to buy it.  I love it FRONT TO BACK!  She touches on every emotion she has experienced in the last year, and has very obviously emerged as a stonger, more confident version of herself.  The album is very candid and sincere, she hides nothing from her audience.  My absolute favorites are \\"The Last Song\\", \\"G4L\\", \\"Photographes\\" and \\"Hard\\".  A+++!
B002VECM3Q|5.0|\\"Weakness compells strength, betrayal demands blood\\". this is what a Ninja sensei portrayed by Sho Kosugi tells his students. in a series of flashbacks we see the ninja Raizo's training from childhood into a cold blooded killer. during an act of heroism, Raizo betrays his clan and becomes a target himself. i can't say too much more as this will spoil the plot. all i can say is that the action is brutal. go see this if you can. you won't be dissapointed. the all out brawl at the end of the movie is great with the final showdown between the members of the clan and finally his own sensei. even my girlfriend loved this movie.

0679721037|3.0|I can't begin to imagine the horror of it.  The flash burns, some with flesh pulling off.  Eyes hollowed out.  Fires.  Thirsty but barely able to open their mouths to take in water.  Vomiting. No wonder it took the United States so long to help the Jews during the holocaust that claimed so many lives.  They were too busy in their own version of the American holocaust against Japan.      This book mentions a second atomic bomb that was dropped on Japan.  This one not in Hiroshima.  It does not detail that event.  Just mere mention.  I was not aware of a 2nd atomic bomb being detonated in Japan.  Toward the end of the book, it accounts various bomb-test sites of both atom bombs and hydrogen bombs and the testing countries.  Got to wonder how much of this radiation is in our drinking water and soil, none of which was contained at the test sites I'm sure as waters do flow to other sites.      \\"Hiroshima\\" follows the lives of a handful of people that survived the A-Bomb.
B001OQCV24|3.0|Alas, this is just the same apocalyptic/doomsday scenario as \\"The Day after Tomorrow\\", but recycled.  Too bad, that the goddamn politicians and the millionaires are the \\"chosen\\" people to preserve the continuation of the human race. Go figure!  The acting is quite good, but many scenes are cheesy, cloying and ridiculous. I hate it, when a serious plot is mixed up or alternates with black humor, out-of-the-context romantic interludes  and literally dozens of narrow escape situations. There are so many of these scenes, that it becomes truly annoying and too much to bear. I'd say that, many of the latest American movies are filled with that sort of junk.     However, Mr. Emmerich has outdone himself in regards to the Special FX and Computarized animations. These alone, make the movie worth seeing!! The Special effects are awesome and fascinating!  The best I've seen in a looooong time. I'm looking forward to watching the movie again as a rental, but purchasing it, well,....I don't know as yet.  I'll give it the benefit of the doubt, when it arrives at Blockbusters.  Five stars for the Special FX and only two stars for the movie!

0316069906|4.0|Jonathan Safran Foer and his family have become vegetarians, and Foer advocates against eating meat.  Sometimes the rhetoric is a bit overblown (hence the four rather than five stars) but, in general, Foer makes, however, compelling argument ethical, moral and practical arguments for avoiding factory-produced cattle, pork, poultry and dairy products. The practical arguments include the damage to the environment and rural economies and, more importantly, that factory produced meat is making us sick.    Foer describes the misuse of antibiotics, poor feed, and terrible living conditions and make animals sick, and make us sick when we eat animals.  Regardless of whether you are a vegetarian, you will not want to purchase a factory-farm chicken, or any animal raised under such conditions, after reading Foer's account of the poop and bacteria filled environments in which such creatures are raised, slaughtered and practiced.  Yes, it's cruel -- that's part of his argument.  But it's also unhealthy, he contends, and causes more than 76 million food-borne illnesses in the U.S. each year.    I have read the comments of the factory farmer, below, and with all due respect, believe that his claims regarding the humane and safe treatment of cattle on mega-farms does not respond either to Foer's evidence and arguments, or to that set out in \\"Food, Inc.,\\" a documentary that every American should see.  Foer does not discuss mega-agriculture, including genetically modified soy (Monsanto, Inc), a topic that is a focus of \\"Food, Inc.\\" (also a book by the same name), which is not meat-specific and criticizes all mega-food production.    Despite Foer's high rhetoric -- he's a novelist, after all -- this book is well worth reading.  Full disclosure:  I do not eat red meat or factory-produced poultry products, but am not a vegetarian, in that I do eat fish (a \\"no-no\\" for Foer, but not for me), as well as locally raised poultry, eggs and dairy products.  The keys are safety and lack of cruelty.  I do not think that eating animals is necessarily cruel, although it is clear that, under current practices, to do so is both cruel, and very, very unsafe.
0786868724|5.0|Aren't we fortunate that Mitch Albom spent those Tuesdays with Morrie?    One wonders how Mitch Albom's life would be different if he had not spent those Tuesdays as he did, if he had given in to his first inclinations and not gone to see his old friend and teacher.     This gifted, talented and introspective writer this good human being, might still be writing about (and living) sports, temporal things that matter only for a little while, and still looking for the deeper meaning of life, of it all.       Because he spent Tuesdays with Morrie, we now have another classic, not an inspirational book necessarily, but a book that uplifts and affirms life, the search for faith, for what if anything to believe, and for life's meaning.     As John Wesley said, and might say again if he could read this book, your heart will be \\"strangely warmed.       Especially recommended for Baby Boomers. Mitch is one of us, and in this book, he comments on, explores and has others share their insight, their keen insight, on the questions we Boomers all have as we age: Life, Love, Relationships, Death and What Comes Next...\\"    It will be a long time, a long, long time, before this book tastes what it calls \\"second death.\\" (Pages 126-129)  We Boomers will buy it, read it again and again, give it to others and, if we are fortunate--and they are fortunate--pass on its values to our children and the next generation.     Read this book. You might find yourself a better, happier, more fulfilled person.  The opportunity is there.  This is not a \\"preachy\\" book. Far from it. This book is about life as we live it, as others live it, and how we all come together in the end.     Good book. Thanks, Morrie, for influencing Mitch and for enabling him to influence and touch our lives, reminding us of what's really important.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I've followed Susan Boyle from the beginning and waited for her CD to drop.  I love it, especially...well, I love all of it!  I find each song an absolute gem.  I could care less if she covers other artists.  SuBo can do anything she wants as far as I'm concerned - except stop singing!  In this day of voice-deprived, over-hyped popstars running around without their panties, she is beyond refreshing.  She has the voice of an angel.  I am and always will be an ardent fan.

0375842209|3.0|It took me a long time to get through this one.<br /><br />It wasn't because the idea wasn't interesting or the narration was poor. It mainly had to do with the characters and the story.<br /><br />I will say, though, that once I got through the first 200 pages, it went much faster after that because I found it more interesting. Still, even then, I would go to pick up a book and I would pick this one up to just put it down again and grab one of the other ones I was reading. I made it through 5-6 other books in the time it took me to get through this one.<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT*** - there are a couple spoilers below (mostly just in the character section)<br /><br />Setting: This is set in Germany during Hitler's regime and WWII. This is the important and well-done part of the book. There are not a lot of works out there that are focused on the experiences of that group of people. I've read books like Corrie Ten Boom's \\"The Hiding Place\\" and \\"Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl\\" and \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" by Viktor Frankl. But those are all from the perspective of Jewish survivors.<br /><br />Plot: The \\"book thief\\" is a young orphan girl who learns to read, helps hide a Jew, and likes to steal things, including books. She writes down all her experiences and \\"Death\\" picks up her diary to tell the tale. The resolution is of a typical pessimistic, anti-hope literary type, but it does work for this book. However, the story itself didn't seem as important to the author as the little word tricks and the narrator conceit, because those overpower the story being told.<br /><br />Conflict: Obviously, there are conflicts with war. But, there are also conflicts with attitude toward the Holocaust and book burning and class struggles and hiding a Jew. There is also ethical conflict (related to stealing), but that resides with the reader, and not any of the characters apparently.<br /><br />Character: The only character in this story that I felt was even remotely well-rounded was Mama. The rest were always the same and never changed and never learned. I felt sympathy for Papa and for Liesel and for Max, but they felt very flat as characters, like caricatures of real people. In fact, I was only sad when Mama died, and noone else.<br /><br />Text: The author was going for literary novel, so interesting metaphors are to be expected. And Markus did deliver some good metaphors, but most of them rang falsely and forced to me. The idea that Death was narrating this was interesting, but I didn't ever figure out WHY. Along with this were some POV violations that totally pulled me out of the story. Additionally, the idea that Death picked up a physical object (or even could - he never does it except, conveniently, for this diary) seemed ridiculous. The little asides were distracting. And I wondered why there was any translation done for German words - it felt out of place and unnecessary. After all, who is Death actually telling this to (another broken conceit)? The idea that Death saw colors was interesting, though.<br /><br />In all, it was a decent read, but I look forward to reading a story about Germans like these where the story or the characters are given the focus they deserve.
B0026P3G12|4.0|A nice album that shows Susan's wonderful voice.  The music helps to bring out her voice, I feel - It's not overwhelming it.  The selected songs are inspiring as well. Only negative, is that I felt that some of the music recording could have had more definition or clarity to bring out the instruments, this maybe getting a bit picky . Overall, an album that is worth to sit down and listen to.  You don't get too many of those these days.

0385504225|5.0|Initially I resisted reading this book, thinking it would have to be derivative and trashy, a literary equivalent of \\"National Treasure.\\" But I couldn't be more wrong. It demonstrates oncemore Brown's unique skill for finding the exotic in the mundane, revealing Washington  D.C. as a Rome of hidden art treasures, which is fitting, since one of his many fascinating insights is that the city (per Brown) was actually intended to be a new Rome. Whatsmore, the book is a brilliant tour de force of amazing twists. Brown is an extraordinary gifted literary magician, misdirecting the reader over and over before leaning forward to pull the quarter out of his ear. I only anticipated his tricks once. Otherwise he fooled me again and again. I can't even remember being so totally taken in by a novel, ever.<br /><br />While one might sneer at the \\"New Age\\" type of mysticism that runs through the book, Brown does a brilliant job of justifying it as not New Age at all, but in fact a uniquely American phenonema, perfectly fitting with his theme of Washington D.C. being a magical place, founded by men whose feet were as deeply rooted in the world of the occult as in the Bible.<br /><br />And always, being written, by Brown, it reads like popcorn.<br /><br />Enjoy!

B00025HI62|5.0|I am very pleased to received this VHS and for the price which was hardly anything it was a gem of a find, however the shipping is what caused getting all the original cast Star Trek movies pricey. The quality is still very good, and I honestly could not be happier with my purchase.
1439102813|5.0|This book moved me, depressed me, scared the heck out of me, and kept me reading long past bedtime. It can't have been easy to delve inside a deteriorating mind, and I applaud the author's courage to do so. I eagerly await this author's next novel.

B002VECM36|4.0|If you've come to this movie expecting an engrossing storyline, memorable acting, and ninja action, well, you'll get the ninja action and heaps of it. The title NINJA ASSASSIN pretty much sums up the movie. There be ninjas and they're assassinating all over the place. One sub-plot centers on an eager, out-of-her-depth forensic analyst for the Europol agency (Naomie Harris) as she stumbles onto the legendary Nine Clans, a clandestine affiliation of ninjas who down the centuries have stolen children and raised them as assassins. The Nine Clans having survived this long by existing primarily as a mere rumor, no way were they about to allow the forensic analyst to keep on digging. She's marked for assassination.<br /><br />The core story revolves around the orphan Raizo, brought up and trained mercilessly by the Ozunu Clan. In flashbacks we see Raizo as an intense child, then as a young man, an apt pupil and in fact the most promising of his generation. We learn what caused Raizo to ultimately defy the Ozunu Clan and to actively seek out the Clan's demise. But the odds are horrifying for Raizo; he eventually realizes he can't do this by himself. It's no real stretch to figure out that Raizo and the forensic analyst will team up. And that's pretty much it, the narrative framework which sets up all the frenetic action sequences.<br /><br />Martial arts buffs should get a kick out of this one. And, again, those with an eye for a meatier storyline and well-developed character arcs will just have to settle for plenty of ninjas assassinating. The story itself unfolds in predictable stages, and there's a pervasive mood that is dark and morose. Also bogging things down is a cryptic serving of hokum disguised as Eastern philosophy. The lead character lends himself to this bleak mood, Raizo being this taciturn dude plagued by his inner demons, driven by his need for revenge, and relentlessly hunted down by his former brethren. Thru Mika Coretti (the forensic analyst who Raizo claims has a \\"special heart\\"), Raizo finally sees a means to an end. Sort of shameful is that Naomie Harris, who was so strong in [[ASIN:B00005JMA8 28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)]] is here relegated to mere damsel in distress duties. Raizo is played by Korean pop star sensation Jeong \\"Rain\\" Ji-hoon, and big ups to his personal trainer, because dude is ridiculously ripped. His acting is so-so. It's probably not that hard playing a laconic action hero with a side order of brooding. But for sure Rain pulls off all the action scenes. Which, with this kind of movie, is really what matters. The treat for me, being a fan of 1980s martial arts flicks, is that Shô Kosugi has a featured role here, as Ozuni, the implacable ninja headmaster. Long live Shô Kosugi!<br /><br />The action is stylized and way brutal. Lots of viscera and rampant body part dismemberment, lots of blood spurting and gushing and fountaining. These are ninjas as they should be, wicked formidable and scary, emerging from the shadows like disgruntled wraiths. I'm pretty fond of the AMERICAN NINJA flicks back in the '80s, but, man, did they ever bastardize the ninja mythos. In AMERICAN NINJA 4: THE ANNIHILATION, I remember seeing packs of ninjas strutting around in bright colored outfits and in BROAD FRIGGIN' DAYLIGHT, and I cringe. In their shadowy element, the Ozunu Clan makes easy mincemeat of their victims, never mind that their targets are armed with hi-tech and modern weaponry. And because the ninja works best in the dark, at times the action sequences are hard to make out. But Raizo is marvelous to look at, especially when he's wreaking carnage with his wicked weapon of choice, the steel blade hook and chain (the kyoketsu shoge). Awesome weapon!<br /><br />NINJA ASSASSIN doesn't really show off a healthy sense of humor, although it flirts some with the absurd, but what it does offer in levity is very welcome, whether it's Raizo guessing a woman's wardrobe size or that exterior shot of the motel andthe car parked outside it, with the car totally swiss-cheesed and bristling with flung shuriken. What made me laugh outloud, though, was when one Europol agent remarked that Raizo \\"Looks like he belongs in a boy band.\\" Because in-jokes are always appreciated. I say go ahead and endure the labored narrative. The fight scenes are worth getting to, hellacious enough that they earn the movie a rating of 3.5 stars out of five from me.he car parked outside it, with the car totally swiss-cheesed and bristling with flung shuriken.

B001OQCV24|4.0|When Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) set out on a camping trip with his kids, little did he know that the world as he knew it was about to end.  It seems top scientists and world leaders have known for years what the Mayans knew - that the earth would be destroyed by earthquakes and tsunamis in 2012 - and only a few people would be saved aboard giant arks being built in China.  Jackson, being a resourceful (and preternaturally lucky) guy, rushes his family to China with no time to spare.<br /><br />This movie delivers on the special effects, no doubt about it.  Watching California collapse into the ocean was really convincing.  There were two problems for me, however:  I didn't like any of the characters (many of whom were cartoonish) and the endless narrow escapes were too ludicrous to take seriously.  Cusack wasn't a strong enough leading man to hold my interest; likewise Amanda Peet never convinced me she was a real wife and mother experiencing the last day on earth.  Their kids were too cute, the Russian bad guy was neither villainous nor funny, just off-putting, and Danny Glover was wasted playing a noble President.<br /><br />I've enjoyed watching Emmerich's other disaster flick, [[ASIN:B00005JMXX The Day After Tomorrow]] many times because the characters were sympathetic, the plot was compelling, and the effects didn't dominate the story.  This movie had too much CGI, unbelieable action, and an ending that was never in question.  This is a good enough movie to see once, but that's all.
0446618306|4.0|This is an awesome novel by Nicholas Sparks. Wonderful quick read that was hard to put down. This is a touching love story without the conventional ending and sometimes I had tears in my eyes reading it.
0312383436|3.0|A have read almost if not all of the books that Madeleine Wickham (aka Sophie Kinsella) has written and while this one is not my favorite, it is definitely among the most enjoyable.  In [[ASIN:0312383436 The Wedding Girl]] the main character is engaged to be married when a secret from her past throws the wedding and her life through a loop.  The book that follows focuses not just on the impact of the main character's secret but also weaves an intricate plot by exploring other secrets held by secondary characters.    In reading this book I had a reaction similar to what I have had with other Wickham/Kinsella books (save for the fabulous Shopaholic series).  In the first few pages I was skeptical.  The plot seemed far fetched and the events unfolded a little too conveniently in order to set up suspense and drama.  It just wasn't believable and led me to roll my eyes a few times.  However, once I got about 60 pages in this all melted away.  It was still a little far fetched, but Wickham developed the characters very well so that I really cared what happened to them and was willing to overlook the predictability.  I also liked that she threw in enough interesting developments that even though I knew where the book would end up it was enjoyable along the way.    In summary this is a good book, not great or awesome, but good.  It shares the common downfall of much of chick lit in that the plot lines can be a little predictable and contrived, but the characters were developed well enough that I still found it breezily enjoyable and read it in two days.
B001TH16DS|4.0|Pros:    - Great restoration work. Really astonishing. Good color, contrast and HD.  - Very nice new special effects, done from scratch. Also possible to see both effects: original and new one. I enjoy this feature a lot.  - Fully remastered digital sound, but keeping the original music and effects.    Cons:    - No wide screen. (I suppose this is technically impossible to accomplish, without distorting the image on screen) So you will see black bars on both sides. Not a big deal, considering this is a 1960s TV show!  - Sound too quiet. Even if you increase volume, it seems that some details are lost.  - Episodes are not in the right order. Can anyone explain why is this? Annoying...    Conclusion:    - If you are a Star Trek fan (even if you are a Sci-Fi fan), you definitely MUST have this. It is a classic, ...and made in HD.   - You can live with the minor cons.

B002BE7JE8|5.0|This film is a classic. While not the first to explore the \\"toys come to life and are evil\\" idea, this film still stands up today. Dispite it's more comedic sequals and countless imitators, the original Child's Play is suspenseful even though you know the doll's alive, because you're waiting for the moment when it reveals itself to be.<br /><br />The story focuses on a boy named Andy Barkley, and his mother buys him a 'Good Guy' doll off a street peddler. Andy seems convinced the doll is talking to him, and after a series of murders his mother also becomes suspicious. It's only a matter of time before the Doll reveals it's true nature, and proceeds to stalk the family.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray package also includes the 20th Anniversary DVD, so if you don't have a Blu-Ray player but are thinking about getting one, get this anyway so you don't end up buying the same film twice. Both the DVD and Blu-Ray include the same special features, with the only difference being the Blu-Rays fancier menus.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray's video quality is naturally better, with images appearing sharper with more detail, and less grain than on the DVD version. The audio is also improved, with both discs including various commentaries.<br /><br />There are some making-of documentaries and some small clips of a CGI Chucky saying various things. Although I really hope that this CGI Chucky has nothing to do with an apparent re-make, it doesn't look very good!<br /><br />Even without the extras, the film is amazing and a classic. It has earnt its place in movie history as one of those films that changed the way we think, the same way Jaws made us scared of the water. This Blu-Ray release does a great job in keeping a whole new generation of film viewers scared of their toys, and that's just perfect!

B001AVCFJM|4.0|Let me start off by saying no one can really replace the original actors of Star Trek.  Each one of them brought something to the development of their character that no one can copy or replace.  That being said, JJ Abrams and crew have done an excellent job of finding actors capable of embracing the roles of Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, Uhura, Sulu, and Chekov; some with more success than others.  Of course, Kirk, Spock and McCoy are the triumvirate at the center all things Star Trek and the three actors taking on those roles put their own spin on the characters while still maintaining the essence of what Shatner, Nimoy, and Kelley gave them.  It would have been a mistake for Chris Pine to impersonate Shatner because it would have come off as mockery; however, even though Pine creates a very different James T. Kirk there are several moments when you can see his inner Shatner coming out.  As Spock, Zachary Quinto's performance is more like an impersonation of Leonard Nimoy's take on Spock, but with this character there was little choice and Quinto is allowed moments when he can bring something different to the role.  Karl Urban's performance as Dr. McCoy is more like an homage to DeForest Kelley.  Of all the actors in the film, Urban does the best in capturing the essence of the previous actor's performance.    *SPOILERS*    As plots go, I'm rarely a fan of time travel; however, Star Trek has always been successful using the time travel conceit.  Most notably in films like The Voyage Home and First Contact.  In this film I think the time travel plot is rather hit and miss.  By using time travel to change Star Trek history it allows JJ Ambrams to create something new and different, and opens the franchise up to whole new adventures.  That I can understand, but in this film I don't necessarily feel that it fully succeeds.  Granted, creating a new time line allows the franchise to go in new and different directions, but for me the destruction of Vulcan and the death of Spock's mother, Amanda, were unnecessary to the overall plot.  However, the way in which this allows the writers to bring the crew together does work.  I especially liked the development of the Scotty and Uhura characters.    One thing that was often lacking in Star Trek films featuring the Original Series characters was special effects, Wrath of Khan being the notable exception.  This film, however, does not scrimp of the effects.  While I hated the warp effect I have to say the space battles looked fantastic.  I especially liked how they incorporate the original sound effect of phaser and torpedo firing, it was a nice homage to the Original Series.  The ship design, while different, was also successful.  My two quibbles are the bridge, which I thought was too cluttered, and the viewscreen that was little more than a glorified window with picture-in-picture.    As a film on its own, this Star Trek is very successful on many levels.  As a prequel to the original series it's still a very successful, if flawed, film.  This may not be the Star Trek we grew up with, but it's a great new vision for the future of Trek and as a long-time fan that's good enough for me.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I assume that if you are here, you have already seen this wonderful Pixar film.  I am going to focus my review of the Blu-ray release of this film.<br /><br />This copy has four discs.  Two blu-rays discs (the film and the extras), a single DVD copy and a digital copy which is intended for ipod/computer etc. usage (this includes an activation number so just be aware of that if you are considering buying this used)<br /><br />If you ever seen an animated film on blu-ray you already known they are amazing in detail.  The extras here really pleased me and that was a big factor in my 5 star award for this release.<br /><br />You get \\"Dugs Special Missions\\" which is a new short that follows the misadventures of Dug the dog.  This is really cute and I think for children, Dug is a memorable character from the film.<br /><br />You also get the short film \\"Partly Cloudy\\", now if you saw Up in the theater and got there on time, you might remember the short film about the unlucky cloud.  It's really a nice short film and I was  happy to know they included it here.<br /><br />You also get the Making of Up and the Many Endings of Muntaz which are essentially alternate endings.  Now on the extra blu ray exclusive bonus disc you have:<br /><br />Global Guardian Badge Game - this is a simply multiplayer geography game.<br />Married Life - is an extended character back story feature<br />8 All New Documentaries.  If you enjoy behind the scenes extras you will really like these.<br /><br />On disc three you get the dvd release which includes the extras and dvd bonus features as well.<br /><br />It's all here....and what a great price for this set.  You can play this film on anything at anytime in your home.  I appreciated the extras and recommend this release.

B002QGUFWE|5.0|It's really annoying seeing reviews that are bagging on Gaga's new songs because they aren't identical to songs from the original 'The Fame' album.  Obviously her vibe is going to change as she evolves as an artist, and I actually would be disappointed with Gaga if her songs were indeed identical to ones on The Fame.  It just shows that she's more than just a one trick pony (as some other 'pop stars' are, who shall not be named.)      I think it's great that she has a new artistic point of view on this new record.  It's nice to see an artist get inspired by her life experiences, rather than relying on other people to write all her music.  There's nothing more annoying than a pop singer who relies on everyone else but themselves to create their image.  They have other people write their songs, create their sets during performances, pick what they're going to wear, etc, and all you get in the end is some \\"singer\\" standing in front of a microphone (which most likely isn't even on since lip synching tends to be quite popular these days) who doesn't even really know the full story of what they're singing about.      So the end result is a person who, not only doesn't know what they're singing about (since someone else wrote the song for them), they're not even SINGING.  \\"Pop stars\\" like these are such a joke.  I would rather have a singer sing live and sound not great, than a singer not even singing, but mouthing along to a track.      Anyway, to conclude, Lady Gaga is a real artist in my opinion.  This album you're going to buy won't disappoint you, as long as you APPRECIATE great artistry.  Enjoy!
B002W6Z0UK|4.0|Sure, I'm not a huge fan of Gaga's, but when a friend let me borrow her copy of \\"The Fame\\" to add to my PC I thought \\"Hey, these songs aren't just your average radio candy!\\" Then, I heard about \\"Monster\\" and thought \\"I have to buy this!\\"    Positives include (but are not linmited to):  - If you bought \\"The Fame,\\" you won't be missing out on the two disc version, get the single disc instead.  - The songs are toe-tappingly catchy, especially \\"Teeth.\\"  - If you buy one cover, you'll get the other one on the other side of the book that the regular CD comes with. For example, I bought the blonde Lady Gaga cover. Turn it over, you see the black haired, eyeliner drenched Gaga! It doesn't say \\"The Fame Monster\\" on the bottom, however.    Negatives:  - The songs are censored. It is unknown whether an uncensored will be released in the future.  - The pictures on the inside of the lyrics book are scarce, unlike \\"The Fame's\\" book.  - Not enough here to please every fan's palette, but enough to say that Lady Gaga sings more than just fame, money, and sex.    All in all, this is a great addition to your music collection! I would highly recommend this to anyone into new or modern style music.

0143105566|4.0|Graham Greene's spy novel, The Human Factor, uses intrigue, deception, and political complexity to demonstrate the balance of love and hate and how governmental intervention affects families and the lives of people. A mature, but lower level spy works in an office with another spy studying data and compiling information. As they work, there is a sense of dissatisfaction, boredom, with a tinge of fear surrounding their positions. Their private lives remain separate from their working lives, but the intersection of the two become inevitable. Maurice seems rather innocuous for much of the book, living a life of love of his wife and son, and going about his normal business. Yet as this marvelous story progresses, we discover another side.    Perhaps the two frightening aspects of this book are the evil doctor who is cavalier and objective about the lives of people, and the sadness that pervades the emotions of those involved. We optimistically hope that Maurice and his family will be able to escape the situation, but destiny does not take us that direction. The sudden but projected death of Maurice's fellow spy, the separation of a father from his daughter, and the odd rejections of religion that interject themselves throughout the story, all come together to demonstrate the inevitable ending. Almost as though we are taught that joys and sorrows often are blended in spite of our efforts.     Greene's use of terse, precise language allows for understatement to take on powerful meaning. Rather than expending effort on rhetoric and excessive description, the prose goes right to the heart of the matter, stating the facts and leaving the reader to devise his own emotion. This makes for a quiet but undeniable energy throughout the book, almost as though a hidden parasite is making its way deliberately through the people and destroying the soul in its wake.     The Human Factor is a book by an accomplished, successful writer intent on reminding us that our lives and our lovesmean more than political overtones in spite of what governments heap on us time after time. The prose is smooth, the sentences spun with precision, and the plot exacting. Perhaps a touch more action would have given this story a little bit more of a page-turning style, and I really wanted the doctor to pay the price for his actions. In spite of these issues, the book is highly recommended.
B00278U1W0|5.0|This is probably the best Blu-Ray I've ever seen.  The sound is terrific and the video is really clear and crisp.  Any Clapton/Winwood fan should seriously consider adding this to their collection. I'd never have gotten to see this live in concert, and this is the next best thing to being there. You have to watch this on a big screen...it's right-in-your-face classic rock at its best.
B002VKE1K2|4.0|A well-written review of any film should never label its subject \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\".  Rather, it should give you an idea of whether or not you can expect to enjoy it, based on your own preferences and expectations.  Paranormal Activity is a particularly controversial film when it comes to the potency of its terror.  Most reviews either complain, with great disdain, \\"I hated it - it wasn't scary at all\\" or exclaim in total satisfaction, \\"It scared the pants off me - I loved it\\".  There seems to be little in-between.<br /><br />I saw the film today, having read enough reviews to know pretty much what to expect.  But before I reveal my own reaction to Paranormal Activity, I would like to offer a few ideas that those who know little about this film may find helpful.<br /><br />Alfred Hitchcock, the celebrated director who was known as \\"The Master of Suspense\\" held many interesting theories about what frightens an audience.  Hitchcock believed that, when properly stimulated, the viewer's imagination was far more powerful - and far scarier - than many direct images that may or may not frighten the average viewer.  Directly depicting a ghost, a monster or a demon for example, even with today's special effects, may scare many viewers, but that will depend solely on the quality of the effects.  And even if well done, many viewers may find the images unconvincing or downright laughable, for they may have other ideas about what a ghost, monster or demon should look like.<br /><br />However, if the filmmaker merely implies that a supernatural event is taking place, and sets up the situation with enough skill, the viewer's imagination can take over and sometimes yield a far more frightening experience than any vivid imagery ever will.  After all, people go to horror films to be frightened, and what could be more frightening than unseen terrors from one's own imagination?  By setting the mood with dark rooms, low lighting, eerie shadows and other effects that many people will associate with their greatest fears, an innocent image of two people peacefully sleeping, unaware of what may be going on about them or to them, can become very frightening indeed, even if few special effects are used.  This is especially true if the moviegoer has developed enough empathy with the characters to place themselves in the same situation.<br /><br />Many modern horror films rely on blood, gore and violence, with horrible creatures conjured up by special effects and vivid scenes involving battles with ugly demons or manic killers in order to provide thrills.  That can be a lot of fun, and certainly very scary.  But it can also be argued that, as CGI effects advance and become more vivid and frighteningly realistic, many viewers become inured to violence, blood and \\"creatures\\" while depending less and less on their own imagination, and in the process, they will sometimes forgo a far scarier experience.  I know that no special effect ever came close to my own nightmares, because my nightmares are stirred by the things I fear most, and not the things that I've been conditioned to find scary.  In short, no amount of vivid terrors can match the human imagination, provided that the imagination is properly stimulated.<br /><br />Well, this is the basic idea behind Paranormal Activity.  Largely on a shoestring budget, the writers/director/actors of Paranormal Activity have managed to create an old-fashioned thriller that relies almost exclusively on the viewer's imagination.  Those who like their \\"scary movies\\" full of CGI, monsters, blood and violence are warned; you will probably be extremely disappointed.  But if you have enough respect for your own imagination, and can allow yourself to be frightened not by what you see, but by what you think is there, you just may find Paranormal Activity to be every bit as frightening and well done as many people say it is.<br /><br />By the way, I saw it with a friend.  He did not find it frightening at all.  On the other hand,I definitely expect to have trouble sleeping tonight.  Whether or not you will agree may depend on how effective your own imagination can be.<br /><br />Recommended.tonight.  Whether or not you will agree may depend on how effective your own imagination can be.      Recommended.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Really enjoyable CD. In a couple instances the music overpowers her voice, but not enough to bother me.  The selection of songs is very good for her voice.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|I have little to add in the way of analysis to the excellent reviews that came before mine, but I'd like to add: indeed, go see this movie, it will take your breath away. Catinca Untaru is unbelievable in her role; the costumes and scenes are of sheer beauty, and the story never predictable.    IMHO: a masterpiece.
B002T45VX6|5.0|Shakira is one of the best pop artists, and even better she is an intelligent, compassionate, creative individual who is unafraid to pursue her own vision.  She Wolf is one of her best albums, full of consistently beautiful and uplifting music.<br /><br />A note to the She Wolf haters:  did you somehow mistake Laundry Service for Hamlet?  Get a grip.  She is still at the head of the pack, and will very likely remain there despite any number of personal reinventions.  Pick up the soundtrack to Love in the Time of Cholera--that is very recent new music from Shakira, and it is much more traditional, maybe you'll like it better.  Personally I can listen to Did It Again a thousand times in a row before I start getting sleepy.  And have you seen that video?!  Oh my god she can dance like no other.  Those hips don't lie.
B00007KQA3|5.0|1984 (Nineteen Eighty Four): 8 out of 10: Most films simply dont age all that well. Philadelphia with Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington for example simply doesnt have the same impact today that it did in 1993. (Both gay people in general and AIDS in particular are simply less scary today.) In another example we have seen both technology and fashion move so fast that the futuristic phones in many a seventies sci-fi movie look positively ancient today not to mention the burnt orange and avocado green color scheme of the future that so many seventies sci-fi are stuck with. (Im looking your way Rollerball.)    So how has a film, released when people outside of American colleges actually believed communism worked, aged today?    Brilliantly. If I say so myself. If anything the film works better today than it did in 1985.    For starters the film itself is timeless. Nothing about the film gives away the date that it was made. Only the fact I know who John Hurt and Richard Burton are gives a hint to time period. The film itself could have been released in theaters last week.    Since the film comments heavily on torture in its last act and on Big Brotherism throughout, if released today it undoubtly would be seen as a direct attack on both the Bush administration and the British Labor government. In fact many scenes are a clear attack on the Bush administrations torture policy and the endless war on Terrorism. One could almost never believe the film was about Communism at all. Modern audiences today would laugh at such a quaint notion.    With few exceptions I have never known a film so timeless. Heck it is one better than simple timelessness. It is actually more relevant today than when it was made. The idea of government using an endless indefinable and unwinnable war to curtail its subjects freedoms is right from todays headlines; whether you are discussing the war on drugs, terrorism, or global warming the results are the same. All the good intentions in the world simply mean less freedom for you and your children. For the greater good no less.    Orwell would be shocked at the creativity governments today would use to curtail peoples freedoms and lives. Or perhaps he wouldnt and that is why his story is so timeless and most remarkably the film based on it is as well.    Oh and the film is fun with a brilliant and perfectly cast John Hurt in the primary role as the put upon and tortured everyman. Richard Burton, not chewing scenery for once, in a role with gravitas; his last I believe. Also super cute and believable Suzanna Hamilton who looks like a real woman both in and out of her clothes as the love interest and the catalyst for desire of change. And a special kudos to a fantastic direction by Michael Radford and production design by Allan Cameron. The really capture a place and time that as I have said before is timeless.    In conjunction with Terry Gilliams similarly themed Brazil, Nineteen Eighty Four is one of the best movies about the early 21st century made during the Nineteen Eighties.
B001M7AGBS|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums.  If you like to bang your head to electronic music, then this is an excellent place to start.  The bands' best music is best performed on this live album.  If you don't get another Justice album, then get this one.  They have truly defined a new genre, and I hope to hear more of this kind of music from them in he future.<br /><br />Regards,<br />proclus<br />[...]
B001QWBM62|2.0|I fell in love with the idea of the H4n but have since returned her upon finding out how unreliable she is.  As a singer/songerwriter/guitarist (of 20 plus year and have done some session work), the metronome feature is crucial as I record in the multitrack mode.  Problem is, the metronome falls out of sync upon playback.  If you record a track in one take, the metronome is fine, provided there are no edits, punch-ins, overdubs, or recordings of additional tracks.  But the metronome falls out of sync upon doing those things for which you use a multitrack: like recording additional tracks (!), editting, etc.       This problem may be unique to me. The manual or online discussion groups have been unable to help.  Sadly, I'm returning the H4n.  I did record one project, 4 tracks--2 guit, voice, percussion--and it sounded great because my one take guitar voice performance was precise to the metronome, which acted as framework for the other tracks.    But it's a deal breaker to not have a metronome that works.      This problem persisted as I continued to use H4n.  I just don't see it being a viable multitrack recorder.    Disappointed.
B0026P3G12|2.0|So much enjoyed her performance on TV with I Dreamed a Dream.  This album is a big disappointment.  Daydream Believer, what is that all about?  As for End of the World, it can't even compare to Skeeter Davis or Karen Carpenter. Very slow album, nice voice but not great songs.  Do some pick me up numbers and maybe more Broadway. Lord help us!
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|What an original film for the whole family.  It looks fabulous and it is filmed with creative wonder.  Definitely something \\"new\\".
B0026P3G12|3.0|Let's begin with the positives. Susan Boyle has a beautiful voice. I was amazed to hear the intelligence of her interpretations and the quality of her instrument. What a find she is! Her voice touches the heart with its warmth and sincerity. Alas, so why did I give the recording a mere three stars? Susan Boyle's debut album needed a background that let the beauty of her voice shine through. The idea is to let us hear her sing, not to overwhelm us with bombastic and cheap arrangements that drown her out and cover her voice rather than enhance it. True, I am an old fuddy-duddy of 78, and what do I know? The truth is that I know the difference between an accompaniment that supports a singer and one that destroys the magic the singer is trying to create. The key is simplicity, not sonic excess that borders on being vulgar. Susan Boyle deserves another album. Next time, let's hope the producers keep it simple! Let her sing songs that are close to her heart...songs that her mother loved. You will notice the difference and be thankful. This woman is special, a rare gem and deserves better!
B001DPHDCY|5.0|If you like the story, which of course you do.  You'll love this film.  Great voices and beautiful animation.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Stateside we are experiencing a one-woman British invasion.  The small independent dealer in our town was sold out.  There was no evidence of the CD on the big chain's shelves.  There were only two copies left, both being held at the front desk.  Amazing!  \\"Cry Me A River\\" is a stunning performance.  In the song where so many have found bitterness, Boyle sounds kind.  The emotional classic \\"The End of the World\\" bursts out of the speakers for me with Susan's clear voiced phrasing, \\"I wake up in the morning and I wonder why everything's the same as it was.  I can't understand how life goes on the way it does.\\"  What a powerful performance.  From the opener \\"Wild Horses\\" that sounds SO utterly different from the Rolling Stones to the lovely \\"Silent Night,\\" this is a strong CD.  Her lovely \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" that first began this journey is gorgeous.  I sit amazed at this talent who has unleashed the beauty of song.  Bravo!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|i LOVED this film.  i was totally surprised as to how good and smart it was.  It really linked itself well to the original star track characters, but added a modern hip edge to it all.  Very cool character development.  I can't wait for more!
B002MW50KO|5.0|This is so darn funny that we were literally rolling on the floor.  It's worth the money--hey, it goes to charity & it's incredibly funny.  Sorry B.D. if you aren't smiling when you listen...
B00168OIOE|5.0|This movie is just so good.  I loved it.  It was so original.  Great for parents and kids (or people without kids).  Also, the animation looks amazing.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|On a Saturday morning somewhere in America, five high school students report for detention in a school library. The group includes a jock, a geek, a freak, a princess, and a metalhead loser, with seemingly nothing in common other than the opportunity to be bullied by a hard-nosed assistant principal.<br /><br />In John Hughes' 1985 classic \\"The Breakfast Club\\", actors Emilio Estevez (the jock), Anthony Michael Hall (the geek), Ally Sheedy (the freak), Molly Ringwald (the princess), and Judd Nelson (the metalhead loser) will participate in an eight-hour ad hoc encounter session, discover a great deal about themselves and each other, and come out a little older and wiser.  Although the way, the audience will be treated to some well-done moments of comedy, drama, and honest teenage angst.<br /><br />Hughes keeps his young and talented cast busy and his dialogue real while respecting his on-screen characters.  They may be stereotypes, but they tap a vein for practically anyone who endured high school in the late 20th century.  The movie features an exceptional soundtrack.  \\"The Breakfast Club\\" is very highly recommended to John Hughes fans of any age.
B001GCUNW6|5.0|Ice age is really enjoyable for both kids and parents.  The characters are smart, well thought out, and funny.  The story is entertaining for kids and definitely rated G.
B001FB55HQ|3.0|I was expecting great things after Christian Bales apparent lack of enthusiasm for T3. Unfortunately for him Terminator 3 Rise of The Machines is far superior to Salvation on every level, better storyline, characters, and much better climax to T4, which is really too derivative of T2's final set piece.    The problem with T4 is that it has no real story to it that you can speak of,  quite frankly it's a mess. Sam Worthington is totally miscast, and seems bored  throughout the whole movie. As for Christian Bale it's a case of now you see him, now you don't.    On the plus side it is full of special effects that fans will love. Ironically the gas station sequence and the subsequent chase scene following it, is the movie's saving grace. It's truly superb and is one of the best set pieces I have seen in any of the Terminator movies. I have not seen the Directors Cut but I am sure it has to be better than this.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|Another great film in the series.  It is crazy to watch them all growing up in front of our eyes.  Actually almost more fascinating the films at this point.  Really enjoyable.  Will be sad when we are all out of books to make!
159562015X|3.0|Nice idea, but no indication of theoretical basis or where the \\"34 themes\\" come from, other than \\"30 years of experience and 2 million interviews\\" (one has to wonder about the depth and type of interview one can offer \\"two million people\\").    Even less impressive is the implicit assumption of accuracy for every test taker, with no warning that these tests are always inaccurate to a greater or lesser degree. The research link shows a test/retest reliability of .6 to .8 after 8- 12 weeks.     The website is usable, but sucks. As an OMI designer, I'm entitled to a professional opinion, complete with technical terminology.  ;)     Having said all that, The test provided a partial, reasonable estimate of what I already know. For me, at this time and place, it appeared to work well, and provided a basis for interesting discussion. Given the understanding that NO test like this is \\"accurate\\", and discussion with thoughtful friends, this seems to be a useful tool. Combined with \\"feel good\\" positive psychology (which also often works) makes for a great marketing racket... Congrats, Gallup, you'll make a ton of money on this.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|I love a good romantic comedy, and that is what The Proposal is.  Was in heaven because I watched it one day at home while I was sick- so it was a god send!  Anyway, this is totally romantic and girlie fab.  Sandra Bullock is totally committed and great as usual.  Actually I thought all the actors did a great job.  They take you to a beautiful area in Alaska which was really cool.  love to be introduced to new cool places through films.  Anyway, a totally enjoyable chick flick!
B000EQ4G5K|4.0|A Girl Like Me is a continuation of Music of the Sun with Rnb and Reggae songs. This time there are more ballads. After listening to this album and music of the sun, i would say that the music and the lyrics have improved. yet, i stil feel that her voice is not strong enough to sing ballads like unfaithful. she sounds out of pitch at times. she sounds better singing dance, uptempo songs like sos and break it off. overall, i still think this album is good and worth listening to despite some flaws.<br /><br />TOP 5:<br /><br />1) SOS-the song that really stands out. it has an 80s sample of soft cell's tainted love.<br />2) Break It Off-her and sean paul sound hot together. it's a great dancehall song.<br />3) P.S. (I'm Still Not Over You)-it's really nice and laidback. she sounds good here. sounds almost babyface influenced<br />4) Selfish Girl-i love the reggae beats in this song. it hits closer to home and my jamaican roots.<br />5) Kisses Don't Lie-it's a reggae song with a little guitar thrown in.<br /><br />Honorable Mention: Unfaithful-one of the few nice ballads on the album even though her vocals are not perfect.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|If you liked Buffy or Angel, Supernatural is the obvious next series for you.  Sometimes it freaks me out a bit more then those others but the plots are good as well as the acting.  Great to have a series from the beginning too.
B000ZECQ08|5.0|Since I had to look elsewhere for DVD details (to decide whether to buy the 2-disc or one-disc film), I thought I'd post here:    1-Disc Wide screen and Full Screen DVD      *Includes both a wide screen and full screen version of the film.  *No special features  *RRP $28.98  2-Disc Digital Copy Special Edition DVD      *Widescreen version only  *Additional scenes (6:31)  *Close-Up with the Cast and Crew of Harry Potter special.

I read the book and thought the filmmakers did a fantastic job with it.  Anyone who wants a film to be an exact replica of any book should do themselves a favor and just read the book again.  Am looking forward to enjoying it again (and again) on DVD.
B001FB4VZS|4.0|I can't believe how long this series has lived.  And it is feeling now like it just starting to get really good!  Did they bring in some fresh writers?  I wish they would do a bit more \\"superman trick stuff\\".  I don't like the series as much when it gets to soap opera-ish.  You've got to laugh at the lighting in this film though, have you noticed that even in the hospital it is always a bit dark like a club...makes me laugh.

B00005N5S5|1.0|I just received this DVD today and I went to view the special features and I found out the hard way that this DVD was not the Special Edition as Amazon.com said it was! I bought the Special Edition several years ago and it's all scratched up now so I wanted to buy a new replacement one. I am very disappointed with Amazon.com about this issue!!!!!     The version I got from Amazon has:    1) The feature movie  2) Trailer  3) DVD rom features    Now the Actual Special Edition Version has:     1) The Feature Movie   2) Trailers   3) T.V. Spots   4) Documentaries: \\"THE TERMINATOR: A RETROSPECTIVE\\" & \\"OTHER VOICES\\"   5) TERMINATED Scenes with commentary   6) Still Galleries   7) Original Treatment  8) DVD ROM Features    So I want to let everyone know that this version is NOT the Special Edition version!!!!! It is just a single release version that you get from Wal-Mart or anywhere for $7.50 or less than what Amazon or the manufacturers are charging!!!!! So don't waste your money!! Just go to Wal-Mart! I hope that I have helped at least one person to make an informed decesion by writing this review. 5 stars for it being The Terminator. 1 star for false advertisement!
B002QGUFWE|5.0|Lady GaGa is an incredible artist. Great voice, songs, lyrics and she has the original style to go along with her work. This is one of the best albums ever!
B002AGIEYG|5.0|For many years the Berlin Philharmonic has been considered the finest orchestra in the world: the 'sound' is rich and resonant, the musicianship of every member is evident, the commitment to the standard repertoire is stronger than any other ensemble - yes, even the venerable Concertgebouw.  It is no surprise then that this set of new live recordings by this orchestra should cause attention: the Berlin Philharmonic has recorded the four symphonies of Brahms under a number of conductors. But here we are with another BRAHMS: THE SYMPHONIES set and the reason for purchasing yet more recordings of Brahms is the sterling interpretation/performance by the present conductor Sir Simon Rattle.<br /><br />Rattle and the Berliners are currently touring the United States with this repertoire (with some added works by Schoenberg, Wagner etc) and every time they enter a different city the reaction is one of extraordinary adulation.  Not that these performances are in the category of 'you have to hear it live to believe it': no, this recorded set of live performances has all the magic and romantic abundance as the live performances. The orchestra has a new sound, one that seems less stilted and rigid and instead far more supple and willing to take the interpretive chances Rattle demands.  The result is a set of four symphonies that everyone knows and loves but suggests that we have never heard them before. Other reviewers have raved about the many nuances in these recordings, listing the comparisons with von Karajan's exemplary lead, and those who take note of reviews here should read those learned comments.  But in the end it is the discovery of just how glorious these four symphonies are, a fact that audiences tend to forget with the frequency of programming they each receive.  Prepare yourself for a revelation.  Purchase this  remarkable set and discover the wonders within.  Yes, it is that fine!  Grady Harp, November 09
B002LBGBR2|5.0|So happy to received this CD/DVD today, it only took Amazon 10 days to reach me. Well done!<br />This is surely one of the best Platinum albums ever released (or re-released) in 2009.<br />The DVD collection is worth all your money. Mind you, this is an imported CD, not sure where the origin is from, but the CD sounds a bit disorted (like typical Asian pressing). Apart from that, this is really a 5-stars for me. New covered track \\"Honesty\\" (org Billy Joel) is fantastic, love Beyonce's voice!<br />This is the second time Beyonce cancelled her world tour in Malaysia.
B0022CY8WK|4.0|The movie is fast-paced, hot, sexy, jazzy, brassy, pure Fosse. I just have one complaint and it's a big fist-clenching, teeth-gritting one for me: Christopher Walken should have played the Richard Gere role!!! Hello!? What were they thinking?
B002X063OC|5.0|Yes, this CD is edited, but the unedited version will be released online in December. I've gone through many of the different blogs and it looks like GaGa had a slight disagreement with the record company who wanted the songs to be censored. Don't worry, the uncensored versions of all of these awesome songs will be released soon enough. Personally, I think the music is awesome either way. A great album.
0061914177|2.0|With all the hype surrounding this book, I had high hopes that it would reveal key insights that I hadn't heard before. But to anyone who has been paying attention to the Internet at all, this book has very little to offer. It is just a re-hash of information that has been talked about over an over. Obviously, you should use social media to build your business. Obviously, these methods are replacing the old methods. But, contrary to what Gary would have you believe, this isn't that different from  the pre-Internet era. Back then you still had to work hard and be passionate to start a successful business.    There are a few useful tips and motivating ideas, but I think they could easily fit in a couple of online articles rather than $14 book.

0882709194|1.0|This is NOT Darwin's Origin of Species.  This is an attempt to sneak one man's willful ignorance and religious agenda into the populace by disguising it at science.  How sad.  How shameful.  This is the misinformation machine in action.  Is it any wonder Americans are so science-illiterate?  America's own Taliban (the Christian Right) are doing everything in their power to sow the seeds of confusion and increase their power at any cost.  God gave us the power to think, the power to choose.  He gave us free will so each of us could make our own decisions.  Yet here are the Christians setting out to deliberately confuse and lie to people, presumably to make sure they make the \\"right\\" choices.  Sounds like the work of the devil to me.<br /><br />This book is being given away at college campuses across the US, which is where I got my copy.  Be sure to recycle yours.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|This is how a Star Trek movie should be! It hearkens back to the days of Shattner & Nimoy.....a feel good story about faith in one another, friendship, overcoming impossible odds for the betterment of themselves and all others! Nimoy's cameo is great as well, connecting the \\"old\\" with the \\"new\\"! It left me feelings of hope & a smile on my face....which was what Roddenberry always tried to do with his vision of the future. If Mr. Roddenberry is in heaven looking down, I think he would smile....
B0002W4SWC|3.0|I actually watched the sequel several years ago and disliked it.  I heard, though that this, the original, was quite good so I watched it.  It was better than the sequel but nothing to brag about.  The cast is first-rate but the plot is so silly and predictable that it doesn't give them much to work with.  Renee Zelwegger is pretty good as the pleasingly plumped-up Bridget who is in her 30's and without a man in her life.  She falls for the scoundrel Hugh Grant, who is always quite convincing as the charming cad and ignores the decent, square-jawed but boring Colin Firth.  We know the ending from the beginning so there's nothing to do but sit back and enjoy the show, if you enjoy this kind of thing.      Zellwegger is surely a game actress and gives every role her all, if it's the floozy dancer in Chicago (her best role, in my opinion) or the poor Southerner in Lone Mountain that won her an Oscar.  She has an innate likability, too, that makes watching her for two hours bearable, even in this silly story.  I like Colin Firth a lot and regret that there was not more of his presence here.  The parents were shown to be awfully stupid and hardly believable.      Silly, but there are a lot of worse films around.
B00005JPS8|5.0|2008 gave us three excellent superhero films: The Dark Knight, The Incredible Hulk.....and Iron Man. Director Jon Favreau truly did his homework while researching Marvel Comics' high flying superhero, and it shows. I think i was one of the very few who thought it would be tragic if there were missteps to putting Iron Man to the big screen. I mean, for every Spiderman or X-Men 2, theres a Ghost Rider or original Punisher. But Favreau understood the appeal and complexities of billionaire Tony Stark, and took what was considered by some to be a second tier character and gave him three dimensional authenticity.<br /><br />For starters, lets not forget Stan Lee, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby, who created Iron Man in \\"Tales of Suspense # 39\\" in the early 60s. Theirs is the blueprint from which this film sprang. It is soooo faithful to the origin of the character, despite modernizing certain elements, which i was totally fine with, since it made total sense: Instead of Vietnam, we see Stark captured in Afghanistan. Instead of a jungle warlord, we have members of a Taliban-type organization, yet the weapons manufacturing angle remains intact. We see Stark's interaction and subsequent friendship with fellow inventor/prisoner Yinsen, well played by Grant Toub. The moment when Stark creates and puts on his original, bulky silver suit of armor had me grinning from ear to ear, blasting his way from captivity<br /><br />As he returns to America, Stark, who was a munitions manufacturer for the U.S. military, decides to change his views on weapons of war and instead use his gifts to battle those who threaten the oppressed, here as well as overseas.<br /><br />Robert Downey, Jr is the engine that drives this film from beginning to end, and hes brilliant. Anyone who knows the character of Stark from the comic books knows hes an at times arrogant, shallow playboy who enjoys his drink and his women. Downey has him down pat and his transformation from selfish, wealthy jerk to a slowly caring humanitarian/hero is peppered with humor and wit. The times we see him designing his suits of armor, through trial and error, mostly error, are funny, yet we see the human being in him with a newfound cause, and the moment in the film when he travels back to Afghanistan, as Iron Man, and wages war on his former captors as they terrorize innocent villagers, will make you jump up and down.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges, one of my favorite actors of all time, plays Obediah Stane, who runs Stark Industries with Tony and acts as father figure to our hero until we discover his true nature and motivations concerning continuing their weapons division. He's a great bad guy. Even Gwyneth Paltrow delivers fun work as Pepper Potts, Tony's assistant. This is the only time i can say i enjoyed watching her on screen, and shes actually fun to watch in her playful interactions with Downey.<br /><br />Tight direction from Favreau, a great screenplay, excellent special effects and a fun, multi-faceted performance from the multi-talented Downey makes \\"Iron Man\\" one of the better superhero adaptations to come along in a while.<br />Loved it.peppered with humor and wit.

0307269981|4.0|Those who have read Stieg Larsson's \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" will want to pick up the second installment in this popular series without delay. In part two, \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire,\\" Lisbeth Salander, a petite twenty-six year old who can pass for a teenager, is financially secure and lives in an upscale apartment.  However, she is deeply troubled and mistrustful, thanks to a horribly dysfunctional childhood and adolescence.  Lisbeth has been through hell and she has the emotional scars to prove it.<br /><br />The male protagonist, Mikael Blomkvist, has not seen Lisbeth for a while (although he thinks about her frequently and even tries to contact her). As the publisher of \\"Millenium\\" magazine, he is greatly preoccupied with an explosive story that he and Erika Berger, the editor-in-chief, are planning to run about the sex-trafficking trade between Eastern Europe and Sweden.  If and when facts exposing the exploitation of helpless girls are made public, a number of prominent individuals will be ruined.  When a tragic event involving two of Blomkvist's associates makes headlines, Lisbeth is implicated and becomes a fugitive.  The police, Mikael, and even Lisbeth's former boss are anxious to locate her before she is captured either by the authorities or a bunch of sadistic thugs who are on her trail.<br /><br />This is a fairly conventional thriller, complete with one-dimensional villains, numerous car and foot chases, a great deal of exposition, and the obligatory twists and turns.  We finally learn about Salander's parents from hell; the horrors that she has endured help explain why she despises authority figures and refuse to kowtow to anyone.  She is a free spirit who dresses unconventionally, hacks into any database that interests her, and does her best to protect herself from her many enemies.  Although she looks as if a strong wind could blow her away, Lisbeth has some formidable weapons at her command:  a brilliant and calculating mind, an almost foolhardy fearlessness, and a bottomless well of aggression.  Blomkvist appears throughout the book, but his character serves more as background noise than a strong and meaningful presence.<br /><br />It is easy to find fault with \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire.\\"  First, the author uses this work of fiction as a soapbox in order to advocate on behalf of society's powerless, especially women and the mentally ill.  He scathingly condemns gangsters and financial cheats who prey on the weak and vulnerable, as well as those hypocrites in law enforcement, the medical profession, and politics who preach morality while they commit depraved acts in private.  Unfortunately, Larsson sometimes crosses the line between storytelling and preaching.  Since Salander and Blomkvist do not collaborate as closely as they did in \\"Tattoo,\\" the novel lacks the electricity that their relationship generated.  In addition, the story breaks little new ground and is a bit too convoluted and drawn out.<br /><br />In spite of these criticisms, \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" gets four stars because of its most important selling point--the indelible presence of one of the most original and engaging characters in contemporary fiction.  Lisbeth can be obnoxious, cold, and unyielding, but most readers will fall in love with her.  She proves that no matter how much an individual suffers at the hands of merciless brutes, it is possible not only to survive, but also to triumph over one's adversaries.fearlessness, and a bottomless well of aggression.

I hope she makes many more albums.  I am so happy for her and for the millions of people who will be able to hear her sing.  She is an inspiration.
0307454894|5.0|Bernhard Schlink is amazingly efficient in his writing of this novel.  It's a quick and relatively simple read, but he has not cheated the reader from a complex and courageous story that really, really makes the reader think and reflect.  What exactly the reader might reflect on depends largely on the reader's personal life experiences.  Schlink develops the relationship between the two protagonists, Michael and Hanna, in the first section as an intensely physical relationship between an adolescent boy and a woman twice his age - undoubtedly a fantasy come true for the young man.  But as life would have it, circumstances bring that episode to an end, but not the relationship, which lasts a lifetime - albeit a lifetime of questioning and some frustrations for Michael, given his inability to separate from his young Love or the endless memories forged by his young experiences into his mind.  While the story is uniquely German in that it draws on circumstances some \\"regular\\" Germans were put in during and after World War II, the underlying themes of the story are universal - just about anyone can ponder them in their own lives.  Schlink, through Michael, poses many, many rhetorical questions to the reader.  And though there are many, they never become a hurdle to the fluidity of the story, but serve to continually draw the reader in by engaging the reader's emotion and, at least for me, reminders of experiences of a personal past.  The reader who simply chooses to read this story for the story itself will not be disappointed; the reader who chooses to open themselves to the content between the lines will be changed.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|WoW!! is the only word that i could comment on this product. An Excellent nature story which takes us throughout the world.

1440423911|4.0|When starting this book I'd have never thought Scrooge would come up with a quotable line, but through the power of Dickens and the three Spirits, even Scrooge was a changed man!<br /><br />Of course just about anybody who celebrates Christmas and has paid attention to the world around them as they've grown up is familiar with the story of Ebenezer Scrooge as written by the genius Dickens.  And most of us have been exposed to at least a few different versions of some animated or Hollywood version of the story.  But anyone interested in a simple and short read at Christmas time would do well to treat themselves to the Dickens classic in its original written form.  You'll likely not be disappointed as long as you're willing to understand that it's Dickens and it's written in his classic Victorian style, i.e., not a simplified Hollywood script.  This was great fun to read and there are some very good points presented by the three Spirits that just about any of us - not just Scrooge - might be able to infuse into our lives at the Christmas time of year.

Everytime I picked it back up, I would play L'Alchimiste by Pierre Bensusan, which seemed to set the perfect mood for the book.    Overall, very enjoyable read, which I'm sure I will pick back up many times over!

B0017SWPXY|1.0|This book had promise, but failed in the fact that Mr. Stein did not go back and read his work from the perspective of the reader. If he had, then, he would have realized that the writing was very disjointed in the fact that it moved from racing to Enzo's \\"thoughts\\" to quarrels in the family. Mr. Stein tried too hard to humanize Enzo and did not truly develop any of the human characters. I had to abandon this very mediocre book because I could not suspend my disbelief any further. If Mr. Stein wanted a book about the \\"art of racing in the rain\\" and had developed it from the driver-teacher perspective, then, that is what he should have done. There are too many themes and issues that are skimmed in this book which makes it a flop, in my opinion. If Mr. Stein had wanted to focus on illness and death, then, he needed to develop that. Just because the main character of the book is Enzo, a dog, does not make it a success like books such as Marley and Me.

0547258305|4.0|Kristin Cashore's debut teen novel is for young people, yes, but I think the intelligently-drawn elements of her work go beyond the YA label. I must admit I wasn't expecting much here - twee art direction on the cover, this book being marketed alongside a plethora of trite YA novels about vampires - but once I plunged in, I was exceptionally pleased to find this story excellently told, with nicely-paced twists and turns both of character and plot. Some of 'Graceling' is fairly traditional - typically weird fantasy names, guys with swords, treacherous kings and all that - but I think that what Cashore did to that formula spins it just enough so it rings familiar, but has a solid new attitude. The depth of her main character is true. What other reviewers see as a Mary Sue, I see as someone more conflicted along the lines of iconic fantasy characters like Aragorn from 'The Lord of the Rings.' Just because a female character wields power doesn't make her a wish-fulfilling cipher for the author. In fact, I thought the development of Katsa's character one of the most novel aspects of the book.  My only problems with it - which others have also pointed out - are some egregious editing errors and the sexual relationship between Katsa and Po. No matter how vaguely elegant the author chooses to describe this, it remains something I still don't think necessary in a book that twelve year olds will read. However, the course of the plot, the pace of the action and the touches of humor definitely made this worthy of following the adventures of these characters into a sequel.

B002KREVCO|4.0|Like many die hard AC/DC fans, I've been waiting for a single release with all of the hard to find Australian and B-Side stuff.  I was extremely disappointed that Disc 1 on the standard set and Disc 1 on the deluxe set are different.  The Deluxe set has all of the Standard set songs plus alternate versions of songs released in the U.S.  I'd have rather had those 6 songs than the entire Disc 2 of the live rarities.  Here's what we're missing:     \\"High Voltage\\" (Australian Release)  \\"It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)\\" (Original Australian Release)  \\"Rocker\\" (Original Australian Release)  \\"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\\" (Original Australian Release)  \\"Ain't No Fun (Waiting Round to be a Millionaire)\\" (Original Australian Release)  \\"Who Made Who\\" (12\\" Extended Mix)    While there are more things in the Deluxe set (a working amplifier, an LP for those that STILL have a working turntable, another CD, an additional DVD, and some misc promo stuff), I was only interested in the 6 additional songs on Disc 1.  They certainly could have included them, they just chose not to.  While I'm glad they finally released the songs that have been floating around on bootlegs for years, I wish they'd have done it RIGHT - for the fans, not the profit.  If you have $200 burning in your pocket pick up the deluxe edition, otherwise definitely pick up this set.
0385504225|2.0|Just like Langdon who is totally shocked and in utter disbelief every 3rd paragraph, I am suprised at how disappointing this book really is.  I have enjoyed Dan Brown's other works, but this one fails to draw you into the story and quite frankly nothing's shocking.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|\\"Dash my buttons!\\" A good dialogue line to use for this award-winner set in 1820's pre-Victorian London. Dickens wrote about class tiers within society, levels of wealth, and the injustices that caused. The Emmy writer, Andrew Davies, condensed the novel, reorganized it's events, and added dialogue into making a series actually considered by some to be better than the Dickens book. That it won 6 Emmys out of 16 BAFTA/EMMY nominations in 11 different area is endorsement enough.<br /><br />Dickens style was not lost. The series includes the caravan of peculiar, grotesque, quirky, and funny characters; the names being equally odd: Flintwich, Pancks, Fanny Sparkler, Pet, Tattycoram, Chivery, Tip, Affery, & Tite Barnacle. Dickens suspense was mingled throughout the 14 episodes, with the overriding plot related to \\"Do not forget\\" inside a watch, and \\"Make it right\\" a dad's dying last words, which remains unrevealed till the end (unless you've read the book). Each individual episode ends with suspense, just like Dickens wrote it originally when published in magazine form.<br />Pure Dickens, but better. What fabulous scenes, sets, locations, costumes, hair, dialogue, props, cast, it's all perfection even Dickens would be proud of.  You will fall in love with Amy, Little Dorrit (Claire Foy) much before Arthur (Matthew Macfadyen).  What a delightful adventure into period drama, humor sprinkled, intoxicating, till you can feel the grime of Marshalsea Prison, and sparkle to the glamor of the rich in Venice. A sensual presentation of a rags-to-riches tale.<br /><br />Was it fiction? The bonus material explains that Dickens father spent 14 weeks in the Marshalsea Debtors Prison, and Charles had to work in a factory at age 12 to help meet the financial needs.  Dickens also had a mistress, an unhappy marriage, and well, how much of this is a Dickens bio? A very enlightening, and lengthy, bonus feature. ALso as a heLpfuL bonus is the subtitLes in EngLish for deaf, hearing impared, and oLde EngLish diaLogue chaLLenged; which utaLized aLL capitaL \\"L's\\" throughout the episodes for some siLLy reason.<br /><br />So now I've added my 2-cents worth to a TV-series worth more than what is being asked in the purchase price. Before the credits were complete, my wife and I decided to start from the beginning for an immediate reviewing. It's that good.<br /><br />By being reviewer #73 on this DVD set, it will be interesting to see how many truly get to reading this, but I found this adaptation of Dickens so well done that I had to offer my praise to all who helped make it possible, including \\"Charles.\\"<br />PLease Leave a heLpfuL vote to heLp me count reader.nd oLde EngLish diaLogue chaLLenged; which utaLized aLL capitaL \\"L's\\" throughout the episodes for some siLLy reason.<br /><br />So now I've added my 2-cents worth to a TV-series worth more than what is being asked in the purchase price.

B00005NNMK|5.0|This is a great CD with a lot of great songs.  'The Final Countdown', 'Carrie', and 'Rock the Night' are instant classics.  However, because the songs are written by the same guy, they all tend to sound the same after a while.  That doesn't make this CD less enjoyable, it's just something I noticed.
B0026P3G12|5.0|When I first heard Susan's version of \\"Wild Horses\\", I was simply blown way. Step aside Mick Jagger, this lady put such a beautiful heartfelt spin into her's, it finally  made me realize that this song is \\"deep\\". At times while this CD is playing, I can actually feel my heart being lifted up and my soul rising. \\"You'll See\\" is another one of her songs that takes my breath away. I have always thought that Aaron Neville was fantastic and Susan's singing \\"How Great Thou Art\\" has earned her a place right up there beside him. I love this CD. It's inspiratonal and pure raw talent. She doesn't need to use anything but her own natural voice to sing her way into my life. I would love, love, love, to hear her sing \\"Somewhere Over The Rainbow\\", and another favorite of mine called \\"Scarlet Ribbons\\". What a gift she has! I am already looking forward to whatever else she decides to share with us. Bravo!!
B00000K2UX|5.0|Top Gun is that rare type of movie that is completely driven by its soundtrack, and the only movie that I know where the soundtrack is as popular, if not moreso, than the movie itself.

Great memories!!

0312323867|4.0|This was a great story. While the first half of the book was a little hard to get through, the second half more than made up for it. I have not read Something Borrowed and I was therefore unfamiliar with the other side of Rachel and Dex's story. It is hard to like Darcy in the first part of the book but you cant help feeling a little sorry for her. She is extremely self centered. She reminded me of a three year old and I remember thinking that she had some serious growing up to do. In the second part of the book, Darcy comes to realize some of her character flaws and begins trying to become a better person.  Ethan was one of the sweetest characters Ive met in a long time.  The dynamics of his relationship with Darcy, evolving from friendship to a steadfast love, was down right poignant.  It makes you think about life, friendship, and love. That what you think you want for yourself in life is not always what will make you happy.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|This album deserves a 5 star rating even though it is edited.  Besides being a very gifted and talented songwriter, Lady Gaga has a wonderful voice.  It is the type of voice that could sing anything.  The Fame Monster is beyond perfection.  When you start with \\"Bad Romance,\\" you think to yourself how can this get any better.  It starts off fantastic and ends fantastic.  Every song is perfection and it's obvious this woman has so much talent when you listen not only to her voice but the instrumental elements of the music itself.  So why can't so many current artists create a masterpiece such as this?  It is because they don't have the creative genius Gaga does.  Lady Gaga is musical perfection.  She's beautiful, creative, talented, gifted, extremely intelligent and gracious.  You will not be disappointed with this album.  I think Lady Gaga will be around for many years.  This is just the beginning for her, so just think what we have to expect from this brilliant singer in the future.  I can't wait!
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan is doing what other artists can only dream of.  Elaine Page's name was unknown to me until Susan mentioned it. Her voice is, to me, magnificent in tonal quality and range. The first day I received the CD I put it on continuous play while doing other things.  It is like a piece of classical music which, when played over and over again, arouses different feelings and emotions each time.  And I do not tire of the music.  My only substantive comment is that it appears to me that she was trying too hard to make everything perfect and was reluctant to belt it out Susan style like she did on Britain's Got Talent.  The words that come to my mind are \\"over-produced\\". They didn't let her take off and fly on her own.  She was particularly timid with How Great Thou Art and Up To The Mountain, sometimes allowing the chorus to drown her out.  As she becomes more comfortable with performing in public she will undoubtedly start to sing her way. I read a critic who stated that the contemporary songs by Madonna and others do not get better \\"sung slow\\" as Susan did.  Perhaps not, but at least I can understand the lyrics when Susan sings them.  I don't listen to contemporary singers, Madonna included, for the simple reason that I can't understand the lyrics when screamed into a microphone at close range along with the sounds of a hyperactive drummer and steel guitars.  I am looking forward to hearing Susan belt out some more show tunes and do some songs with a beat.  Her voice is somewhat reminiscent of Janis Joplin singing the Bules before her decline.  After listening to Cry Me A River and Up To The Mountain several times I noticed that she seems to have a natural talent for singing the Blues.  It would be interesting if the next great Blues singer is a little lady from a small town in Scotland.  I'll buy any CD that Susan produces and am very much looking forward to the next one.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Awsome, my husband and I am looking foward to season 2. It really surprised us!
B0026P3G12|3.0|Susan Boyle is a dream. Who can ever forget her first appearance on the scene singing \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\"?  I still look at that video and get all choked up. It pains me to write this review. I had high hopes for this album, waiting months for it to be released, and I am now not just disappointed but angry. Not at her, but at the money-sucking scoundrels who overproduced this album.<br /><br />On some of these cuts she is backed up by screaming pitchers, not singers mind you, but people who scream near pitches at the top of their lungs with a forward vowel color so sharp and edgy it could peel paint.<br /><br />Susan Boyle's work on this album is clearly heart-felt and her vocalisms are largely commendable and inspiring. But she is betrayed by a musical and electronic falseness. With the hundreds of cathedrals built in Great Britain over a 500 year period, she would have been better served if they had schlepped a recording deck and 3 mics into any one of those perfectly crafted acoustical marvels instead of the false electronic echo (Grand Canyon simulation anyone?) that infects this album. The old Decca/London and Sony predecessor Columbia engineers knew how to record with just 3 mics perfectly placed. There are skilled recording artisans out there today, but these jokers from the Sony \\"pop\\" team are devoid of education and ability.<br /><br />This album is a travesty. Buy it for \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" and \\"Cry Me A River\\" and a few others. But dear God in Heaven avoid \\"How Great Thou Art,\\" \\"Amazing Grace,\\" \\"Up To The Mountain,\\" and tragically \\"Silent Night.\\"<br /><br />I hope the beautiful Susan Boyle can find another team that will serve her well in the future.<br /><br />It pains me to write this, but she honestly deserves better. Lets hope she keeps dreaming.

B001QERPDO|5.0|I had seen and heard The Script on VH1, and recently saw them live in Atlanta on tour with David Cook and GRO.  The Script put on a great show. After the concert, I came home to listen to some of their songs (minus the screaming crowd), and loved them so much, I bought the album.  As a Kris Allen fan, I was even more intrigued that The Script had written two songs on his new album.  I confess that I am from the old school who likes a good melody, intricate lyrics (more verse than chorus), and good vocals that don't sound like a cat fight or a murder in progress. There's only one song on this album that doesn't fit that description, so The Script has just found a new fan!
B001ASVXSE|5.0|For those who do not have a problem with shelf space, or those who have not yet collected much of Oistrakh's EMI legacy, this box really is a great deal.<br /><br />David Oistrakh was inarguably one of the 20th century's supreme artists. He won several major competitions in his life time (though, perhaps more famously, he finished 2nd to Ginette Neveu in the Wieniawski competition of 1935). He worked with many of the greatest artists of his day, was the dedicatee of several famous works, and Shostakovich wrote both of his violin concertos for him. The respect of his peers is evident in numerous writings, and many violinists of today view him as a role model. His influence on the next generation is large, having, at some point, taught many of the professional violinists to emerge from the USSR during his long tenure wth the Moscow Conservatoire. He received several awards from the Soviet state, most notably the Stalin Prize in 1942 following his performing on the front (there is a wonderful tale of him performing during the bombing of Stalingrad).<br /><br />The contents of this 17 cd box set includes an awful lot of top grade material available in other releases. These include:<br /><br />-- [[ASIN:B00005NPJ1 Brahm's violin concerto with Klemperer]] and Mozart's Sinfonia concertante with Oistrakh on viola, his son Igor on violin.<br /><br />-- Mozart's violin concertos, released in two disks: [[ASIN:B00005NPJK 1 to 3]] and [[ASIN:B00005NPJL 4 and 5]].<br /><br />-- The violin concertos of [[ASIN:B000003XIE Beethoven and Sibelius with Ehrling]] (on Testament).<br /><br />-- The famous recording of [[ASIN:B00000I7VO Beethoven's triple concerto]] with Oistrakh, Richter and Rostropovich, released with Oistrakh's recording of Brahms' double concerto with Rostropovich.<br /><br />-- The box also includes Oistrakh's preferred recording of the double concerto of Brahms, his recording with Fournier. This comes in several releases. For instance, it is coupled with [[ASIN:B000EF5MH2 Bruch: Violin concerto No.1]]. It is also in an earlier [[ASIN:B000002SE3 2 cd set]] which includes Oistrakh's recordings of the Mozart violin concerto #3 (mentioned above), the Prokofiev violin concerto #2, and Brahms' triple concerto again, this time with long-time partners in crime, Oborin and Knushevitsky. (All of these recordings are also in the box set under review!)<br /><br />-- The \\"creator's\\" recording of [[ASIN:B000I2ISM2 Khachaturian's violin concerto]], with the composer conducting, Oistrakh being both the dedicatee and the author of the cadenza.<br /><br />-- A wonderful selection of [[ASIN:B0002VEPR6 showpieces for violin and piano]] with one of Oistrakh's most regular accompanists, Vladimir Yampolsky.<br /><br />I could go on; the above were pulled up in about 10 minutes. I suspect if I felt utterly compelled (and believed the reader had infinite patience!), then I could find releases of all of the works in this box from within the last 10 years or so. For the sake of the reader's sanity, I'll refrain!<br /><br />Now, the observant reader will have noticed there are several doublings in this set. None of the doublings are disappointments; in fact most of them are viewed as classics in their own right (another testament to Oistrakh's talent). Specifically, the doublings are<br /><br />-- 2 recordings of Beethoven's violin concerto: one with Cluytens, one with Ehrling (both are wonderful).<br /><br />-- 2 recordings of Beethoven's triple concerto: one by Oistrakh, Richter and Rostropovich with von Karajan conducting, the other by Oistrakh, Oborin and Knushevitsky with Sargent conducting (I admit I prefer the latter one).<br /><br />-- 2 recordings of Brahms' violin concerto: one with Klemperer, one with Szell (I like both, but in fact prefer a recording of the work by Szeryng).<br /><br />-- 2 recordings of Brahms' double concerto: with Rostropovich and Szell, the other with Fournier and Galliera (I agree with Oistrakh, the Fournier does seem better).<br /><br />-- 2 recordings of Mozart's violin concerto #3: the Berliner Philharmoniker and the Philharmonia Orchestra.<br /><br />Before ending this (to everyone's relief!), it would be remiss of me to fail to mention two more things. Firstly, Oistrakh gives a magnificent performance of the solo cadenza in the 3rd movement of Shostakovich's violin concerto #1. And secondly, the last disk provides a really excellent performance of Schubert's octet (this was released most recently by Monopole in 2007, only a year before this box set was released). In fact, much of the chamber work in this release is first rate.<br /><br />So to end this, what can I say? Those who own and love Oistrakh will already own much of what lies in this (not so) little box. For those, the benefit of purchasing this set lies in the fact that pretty much everything here appears to have been remastered relatively recently. For the rest, especially those in the process of building a quality personal collection, face up to the reality that you are always going to end up with an odd doubling or two, grab this opportunity by the scruff of the neck, and buy this great release by EMI.Before ending this (to everyone's relief!), it would be remiss of me to fail to mention two more things.

For the rest, especially those in the process of building a quality personal collection, face up to the reality that you are always going to end up with an odd doubling or two, grab this opportunity by the scruff of the neck, and buy this great release by EMI.

B002HWRZH0|5.0|I'm a reasonably serious collector of STAR TREK replicas (I have a Master Replica's 33-inch ENTERPRISE, for instance).  I'm very impressed by the all-metal ENTERPRISE included with this set.  The ship itself has a brushed-metal finish, and the stand (which is NOT removable) has a shiny finish; it makes for an attractive pairing.  The model is not hyper-detailed, which is a plus, I think, at this size:  no windows on the hull, for instance.  This is smaller than the Franklin Mint pewter starships of years gone by, but is a very impressive piece.  I was one of those who hated the new ENTERPRISE design when I first saw stills of if, but it's growing on me, and this clean reproduction (not too much detailing but all the detailing that is there is correct) does a very nice job of showing off the design.  I'm glad I bought it.  (Oh, and it goes without saying, but the movie itself rocks, and the Blu-ray transfer is flawless.)  -- Robert J. Sawyer, Hugo Award-winning SF author; co-editor with David Gerrold of BOARDING THE ENTERPRISE.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I watched the YouTube video of Susan Boyle over and over because her voice just blew my mind. There was no doubt in my mind that I would order her CD. It is a very interesting selection of songs, and each rendition is fantastic. This is one of my favorite CDs of all time and I am just finishing listening to it for the first time! I've been going through some stressful weeks lately and I could just feel all the stress melt away as I listened to this fantastic woman.
B001KVZ6ES|4.0|As with almost all Clint Eastwood films, he has again come through with an impactful creation. There is someone in this movie that you can identify with, no matter who you are. Mr. Eastwood solicited people with the right heritage to be his stars. Unknowns and the real deal. That's one reason you can feel the emotions.    I rate the film itself a five plus but the high prices for BluRay just make my blood boil. It's the music CD rip off all over again.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I have just finished taking about two hundred Thanksgiving pictures with my new SB400 and Sto-Fen Omni-Bounce (the two should be bought together).  The difference, when compared to pictures taken with the in-camera (D-90) flash, are very positive and very substantial.  With the in-camera flash, the lighing was harsh and uneven while with the SB400 and Sto-Fen Omni-Bounce, the lighting was gentle, even, and enveloping.  I wish I had purchased this attachment earlier.  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to improve the quality of their flah photography.
0688014291|4.0|I read this book right after reading the book \\"Who Moved My Cheese\\" by the same authors. It is also a quick read and can be read in about an hour and a half or so. The book is easy to read, and quite frankly I found it a lot better than the cheese book.<br />Mostly because it gives managers a good insight into what we do wrong and one possible way to correct this.<br />Their method comes down to a simple advice: Do not wait with compliments and complaints and scoldings and praise until the annual review, but do it whenever it is needed and then scold the behavior, but appreciate the person.<br />Their second advice (although it is given first) comes down to making clear to both manager and subordinate what is expected. Too many employees and managers think different of what is expected of them and have not written it down. Thus confusion begins and people feel unjustly treated.<br /><br />This book I also borrowed from the library, although I might someday buy it. I would recommend this book, both due to its good advice and easy readability. But I find the price of 16 dollars high for the content in it.
B002VECM36|5.0|This movie is completely awesome. You should know that there will be blood, oh boy is there blood. Body parts flying everywhere, heads getting lopped off left and right, hands, arms, legs, torsos being cut in half, and exaggeratedly immense amounts of blood gushing everywhere. People die in this movie, a LOT of people die in this movie, and not in nice ways. There's also more than your fair share of shooting. This is the best Martial Arts / Ninja movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a LOT of them. And what ninja thriller would be complete without an appearance from none other than Sho Kosugi? There is a lot of fighting in the dark, which of course is going to happen where ninjas are involved, and this makes some of the fight scenes a bit hard to follow. However, that just immerses you more into the chaos of the scene. You think it's hard to see what's happening? Picture being in a pitch black warehouse with dozens and dozens of soldiers and automatic gun fire and also barrages of ninjas coming out of everywhere swords-a-cutting and throwing dozens and dozens of throwing stars at anything that moves. Yeah, it's going to be a bit difficult at times to see just what the heck is happening. There is some supernatural-ness to the film but it fits in well with the context of the movie. The surround sound of the movie theater was taken full advantage of with throwing stars coming from all directions, and oh my gosh they threw a LOT of throwing stars. I bet this movie hands down has the most throwing stars used in it of any other movie. And they're not you're regular throwing stars. These babies are about 6\\" across, four pointed, and razor sharp. It reminds me of those movies that have thousands of archers sending thousands and thousands of arrows at the enemy. This was a similar thing but with barrages of throwing stars instead. If you're into these types of movies, this has to be the best one to date. If you're not into these types of movies, you'll hate this one just as much as any other ninja movie. I personally believe that all other Ninja movies will be compared to this one from now on.

B000FIMG68|4.0|I didn't watch \\"Lost\\" when it first started but instead decided to catch it on DVD beginning a few months ago.  I have to admit that I'm not a huge fan of fantasy or adventure shows, so I didn't think I was missing anything.  However, the reviews have been so consistently good that I decided to give \\"Lost\\" a chance.  Frankly, I was disappointed in the first season, which so many people said was a classic.  I found the show to be exceedingly slow moving.  Every time something happened on the island, we immediately went into a flashback.  Yes, the flashbacks helped further character development, but I found most of the main characters annoying, especially Jack, Kate, John Locke, and Sayid.  Their constant stubbornness was extremely annoying, so I really didn't care their back stories.  Likewise, too many scenes were repetitive and ended with the same arguments between the same main characters.<br /><br />In season 2, things start to pick up quite a bit.  Numerous things actually happened ON the island and the flow of the show wasn't constantly interrupted with flashbacks.  Furthermore, the flashbacks became more interesting as we saw some of the same people showing up time and again.  My patience in slogging through Season 1 paid off during this season.  Not that all is perfect with the show.  Several of the new characters are just annoying as the previous ones, especially Ana Lucia.  J.J. Abrams seems to specialize in stubborn, rash, hot-headed characters who shoot or knock out people at the drop of a hat.  It gets so repetitive!  How many times can John Locke get knocked unconscious before his last remaining brain cells are damaged?!?!<br /><br />Fortunately, during Season 2, \\"Lost\\" starts to take itself a bit less seriously.  I loved the scenes where the supporting characters start to question why Jack and Locke are in charge all the time.  That's the first questions I would have asked!  They have made so many poor decisions and lied so many times, why would these people trust them?!?!  At least the addition of new characters takes a bit of the focus off them.  All in all, there are enough positives in Season 2 that I plan on continuing to watch the series; which is not something I was excited about after Season 1.st them?!?!  At least the addition of new characters takes a bit of the focus off them.  All in all, there are enough positives in Season 2 that I plan on continuing to watch the series; which is not something I was excited about after Season 1.
B001WCBPCW|1.0|I don't get the enthusiasm, over this band/album. IMO a much better group in the same genre is Glasvegas. I see some similarities here to like Blur, Oasis, and even, of course, the Beatles. But there are far better bands in this genre out there IMO. Apparently this album is getting a very good response, but IMO it's probably for people who are heavily into this sort of music.
B002O5M4SA|1.0|First of all: I love this movie. It should have received a much better treatment than it has now. The standard DVD was by no means perfect. The Blu-ray is awful. Image contrast has been boosted to ridiculous heights, leaving no detail in any tone slightly lighter than a midtone. So as soon as daylight enters the picture: shadow areas stay and the rest dissolves into a white, bleached out glare...  Sony should be forced to rerelease!
B000NA28HU|1.0|first i will say for one thing its not the book be cause the book is epic i will say however the only real redeeming quality is that jeremy irons was perfectly cast as brom. and who decided that the ra'zac have to die in the movie??? also let it be known that lord of the rings is lame too. go star wars!!! yeah lets see elija wood get his arm cut off and not cry about it. i digress i would not recomend this movie. although arya was hot her hair was the wrong color and her ears were not pointed seriously how hard of a change was that i wonder?
B0026P3G12|5.0|what a beautiful cd. every song is great and heartfelt, especially 'Up to the mountain' which has a gospel element to it. So glad we all hung in there with her. Can't wait for the next cd and for Susan's time in the spotlight to continue shining...
0307266303|5.0|Although ultramarathoning is still considered a fringe sport by the at large American population, it is rapidly growing -- the fastest-growing outdoor sport in the country in 2002, in fact -- and given the popularity of Christopher McDougall's \\"Born To Run\\", I'm not surprised by that claim. What you may be surprised to discover, however, is that homo sapiens evolved because we ran. And we survived -- thrived -- because we ran far.    This book is part self-discovery, part history of running lore, and part exploration of running mechanics. McDougall embarks on this journey because of a single, simple question -- \\"How come my foot hurts?\\" -- to which few medical professionals proffer anything except, \\"You just aren't physically built to run\\". Refusing to accept their hopeless diagnoses, McDougall devours all things running-related, visits medical specialists, and eventually hunts down Caballo Blanco -- the White Horse -- a gringo living amongst an ancient, hidden tribe: the Tarahumara. The eventual meeting of Caballo Blanco marks the beginning of a fundamental shift in McDougall's running form, philosophy, and life disposition. To wit, running well meant living lean and building soul as much strength. And Scott Jurek, the perfect embodiment of American ultrarunning, bridges the gap between the modern ultrarunner and the Tarahumara. Sprinkled throughout the story of how a handful of elite American ultrarunners, Jurek and Luis Escobar included, trekked down to the Copper Mountains of Mexico to race against the legendary Tarahumara, McDougall offers up thoughtful and well-reasoned explanations of barefoot running, the evolution of running, and \\"persistence-hunting\\" (hunting via running).    There are many (many!) underline and write-in-the-margins excerpts in this book -- some about Jurek, the Tarahumara, Caballo Blanco, and others just about running. The story about Jurek's resolve at his first Badwater 135 race is particularly moving:  \\"There's no way, Scott told himself. You're done. You'd have to do something totally sick to win this thing now.  Sick like what?  Like starting all over again. Like pretending you just woke up from a great night's sleep and the race hasn't even started yet. You'd have to run the next eighty miles as fast as you've ever run eighty miles in your life.  No chance, Jerker.  Yeah, I know.  For ten minutes, Scott lay like a corpse. Then he got up and did it, shattering the Badwater record with a time of 24:36.\\"    Barefoot Ted is also extensively quoted -- running barefoot is witnessing a tremendous uptake in believers -- due, in no small part, to the popularity of this book. The sage of barefoot running, Barefoot Ken Bob, declared:  \\"Shoes block pain, not impact! Pain teaches us to run comfortably! From the moment you start going barefoot, you will change the way you run.\\"     McDougall also interviews and extensively quotes a handful of academics, e.g. Dr. Dennis Bramble of the University of Utah, regarding the history and the role that running played in human evolution. Theories are explained, evidence presented, and examples provided, all culminating to Dr. Bramble's solution to human excess and epidemics: \\"Just move your legs. Because if you don't think you were born to run, you're not only denying history. You're denying who you are.\\"    There is much more to this book -- more than I could conceivably write here -- but suffice to say, I devoured this book in several hours and have been digesting it since. And to hijack a saying of the Tarahumara: \\"When you run on the earth and run with the earth, you can run forever.\\"

B002RSDW80|3.0|2009 has been a tough year for a film-goer like me.  i am drawn most strongly to character-driven films such as last year's 'the reader' or 'frozen river' or to film biographies that meticulously researched and star-driven with that type of performance that is likewise so researched, yet so nuanced that a viewer can feel he or she is seeing the personality. right there. no frills. in the recent past, jamie foxx and cate blanchett more than fulfilled my needs with their interpretations of ray charles and katharine hepburn. now meryl streep has done the same in this year's 'julie and julia'. her work is standing alone, though there have been and will be the requisite numbers of film biographies for 2009.<br /><br />words cannot describe streep's performance but i am going to give it a shot. streep is a zesty, tangible delight as world-famous chef julia child. and i am going to stop there because i cannot go any further without mentioning stanley tucci as child's husband paul or jane lynch as child's garrulous sister dorothy.  both offer solid support; i hope tucci's work will get its reward when awards fest begins.<br /><br />these three actors made such a strong impact on me as an audience member that i found myself getting a little testy waiting for them to come back on screen. child's career beginning as a chef runs parallel to the story of julie powell, played charmingly by amy adams.  powell, an overworked city employee, is encouraged to start a blog by her husband eric played by chris messina. so, her blog becomes her day-by-day working through child's first cook book.  although her story is an inspiring one, it is not as interesting as child's. and adams and messina are too cute to be believed, even as they squabble. julia and paul's life is portrayed as largely idyllic and you think that would be the boring one. but it isn't.<br /><br />but at the same exchange, i can live without a film about child. at least right now.
1416562591|4.0|Balram Halwai was born in the dark country of India.  He is dubbed \\"White Tiger\\" by a teacher who doesn't teach because the government isn't paying him his salary.  Instead, the teacher steals the money sent for the students' uniforms and sleeps on the job.  This is only the first of many corrupt situations Balram recognizes and confronts.<br /><br />Balram is originally the \\"white tiger\\" because he is rare - a student who can read.  Throughout the book Balram's actions are unusual for his station and position, letting him still refer to himself as that rare animal, the white tiger.  Is he really different from the others?<br /><br />I never knew where this book was going.  The more I think about it, the more I like it.  This book won the Man Booker Prize.

This however while it has a couple good songs, is not nearly equal to stuff she did previously.<br /><br />The Techno sounds are the absolute worst.

B001R60ESE|4.0|Wow! I saw part of this Blu-Ray in a Best Buy here in MN and was immediately impressed. I wanted to buy it then and there but, alas, they were out of it as were all of the other Best Buy stores in the Twin Cities. (Why have it on as a demo in your store when you don't have any to sell?) So I ordered this from Amazon and am still totally impressed.     Technically, the Dolby TrueHD 7.1/5.1 sound track is enveloping, crisp, and impeccably mixed. (I only have 5.1 so cannot comment on the 7.1 mix.) The smooth sound of Chris' trumpet is perfectly captured not being harsh nor dark. Chris has amazing tone and it's beautifully represented on this disk. The picture is stunning without presenting annoying hues that many live concert videos do. Thank the lighting crew for that. The blacks are dark yet detailed, and the colors vibrant. Detail overall is excellent.    Performances? You will see some musicians in circumstances that you have never seen them before. Yo Yo Ma jamming with Chris on the beautiful \\"Cinema Paradiso\\", and Steven Tyler (Yes, that one!) singing \\"Smile\\" (Yes, that one!) to his father in the front row. Both are simply astonishing performances. And violinist Lucia Micarelli with blow you away with her passionate, and emotional playing.    To tell you the truth, I had not even heard of Chris Botti before I saw this disk. I am not just a fan raving about this Blu-Ray, but a person that was totally captured initially and continue to love this performance. It does lag a bit in the 2nd quarter of the show, but picks up again with some spectacular songs with great guest artists. (John Mayer, Kathrine McPhee anyone?)     Chris plays a humble yet very competent host and I think that even if you are not a fan of this type of music, you'll be hard pressed to stop watching this disk.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|Like THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT before it and PARANORMAL ACTIVITY after it, CLOVERFIELD is a mockumentary horror film consisting of footage taken from a handheld camera. Unlike the others in its subgenre, it makes great use of fantastic and expensive special effects that are so seamlessly integrated into the rest of the film, particularly in the collapse of the Woolworth Building near the onset of the mayhem, that you really feel like you're seeing what it would be like if a giant monster attacked Manhattan. (In this it stands apart not only from its closest thematic equivalents, the dreadful recent remake of GODZILLA and also the three versions of KING KONG.) The dreadful mistake the moviemakers made was to use as its central characters a group of spoiled, self-indulgent twentysomethings in Manhattan, and involve us in their tedious romantic doings to a great extent before the attacks on the city finally begin so we have an unconvincing excuse for why the characters would not try to leave the evacuated island and try to save another character trapped in a collapsed building in midtown. (Worst of all, the camera is held among this Scooby-Doo gang by the Shaggy character, who is supposed to serve as comic relief.) The most fun in the movie are the shots over the characters shoulders of the crossfire between the military and the rampaging monster (at which you never get a good view until the very end, when the filmmakers unwisely spoil the mystery by giving us a long lingering look at it). The film may make some queasy morally at its resonances with 9/11, and others literally with its restless handheld roving shots.
B000002VE7|2.0|This may have been worth something upon release, but the eighties synth-power-pop production aesthetic which had firmly taken root renders these competent, though rarely compelling, dusty tech-fests irrelevant today.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I had not bought a CD in years. Well, Susan Boyle captured my heart with her BGT performances and I gave in. The CD certainly is easily an album I will treasure for a long time. Just can't get enough of that voice. As others have said, Susan could sing the phone book and I would buy it. Strange thing is, that probably is true!
B000001FTJ|4.0|Waits continued to refine-by-expanding his particular brand of bar-room eccentricity with this impressive triumph of gritty artistry which finds the doomed crooner substituting fuller, albeit stark instrumentation over his typical piano-man setup.
B000002PCS|5.0|The sound track of this film has been in my mind since I first watched the movie several months ago. The CD goes everywhere with me in the car and somehow all the other CD's I have now pale in comparison. I cannot get the music out of my mind and every time I listen to it, I can relive the scenes from this wonderful film whose scenes blend perfectly with the music. The score and the film are the result of a labor of love on the part of John Barry and the cast of \\"Somewhere In Time\\" as there was little support for this film which had a very limited budget.
B00004W3L3|2.0|2 1/2    I suppose the 80's were a tough decade to get your progressive fix, but that is no excuse for this simply being derivative mostly of lesser Genesis, with a small helping of greater.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Whole family watched this movie Thanksgiving - everyone liked it, Trekkies and non-Star Trek fans alike.    There were a couple of inconsistencies with the original movies series, so maybe a new series is born which will explain them.  Casting, acting, directing, and visuals are superb.    The blu-ray definition and 5.1 sound are A-1, too!

There is not a single song on this album that I don't love.  I have been listening to the entire album on repeat, and it is both energizing and relaxing at the same time (how is that possible)?    If you like classic Bon Jovi, then you will likely love this album, too.    I recommend it.

B002Q4TKAY|3.0|I eagerly bought this CD/DVD of The Killers playing live at the Royal Albert Hall and I was sorely disappointed. The music and performance are good, but the sound is terrible. The CD sounds like it was a bootleg recording, all the instruments sound extremely dull. Only Brandon Flower's singing makes it through the speakers sounding somewhat clearly but everything else is washed out. I don't know what they did to produce such a poor album soundwise but it's a shame and not worth the money I paid for this.     The DVD sounds slightly better than the CD, but again I don't think audiophiles will be too impressed by the qiality here either.

B002HWRYJE|1.0|This film should be retitled, \\"Ghost of Spock's Brain\\"    It is my opinion that this is hands down, the worst trash I have every viewed in my life.     It appears the current owners of this series have casually decided that the star trek franchise was somehow inadequate.     In an instant the entire series has been rewritten, and for what; the sake of profits and commerce?     The haphazard way in which the characters are throw together absolutely disgusts and sickens me.     Clearly no thought has been given to the foundations of this franchise.     To me, there is no more vivid example of greed and capitalism run amok; than this \\"film\\".     I will never buy another star trek item of any type for so long as I live, nor will I go to see any future star trek anything.

B000UBMWG4|5.0|I was 16 when I saw BR for the first time in 1982 and I still enjoy to watch it every now and then. Loved to see Rutger Hauer with dyed hair and a weird accent. The punch line of the story (Dick's artificial intelligence and the question about human rights) and the very darkness of the shooting, in my opinion, gives this motion picture his unique style which is still standing after 27 years and I hope there will never be a remake! The props and dressing are very much 80's, but thats gives BR a cult film status.     I ordered this package because I wanted to see the different editions of BR from the past 25 years: the original, the directors cut, the final cut and the workprint AND the deleted scenes. This gives you an idea how Scott struggled with the story and I how he was forced to make certain decissions in regards of the demands of the studio. Is Deckard a replicant or not, you want a happy end or a more dark end, what happens with Rachel and the voice over from Ford. Maybe in the future this box come with a editor selector: you can make your own version of the BR story by selecting your own favourite scenes!    Very enjoyable item with loads of backstage material. Haven't watched all of it (saved some for a rainy day!). Blu Ray is absolutely fantastic and the upscaling of DVD-material to Blu Ray standard works pretty smood. This is the ultimate gift for BR fans. I ordered this package from Europe and I received it within a week! Excellent service with a very fine price-quality ratio!

B000NY17J6|5.0|If you are a fan of Linda Ronstadt,you will love this collection-it combines both of her Greathest Hits albums into one fantastic walk down memory lane. If you have never heard any of her music(and I can't imagine who hasn't)this is a perfect introduction. She has the kind of voice that is suited for both uptempo songs and ballads. I recommend this not only for the reasons I've already stated,but for the value as well-for a collection like this,you can't beat the price!

B001QOGYB8|5.0|When we meet Mr. Fox he's in a bind - he and Mrs. Fox get caught in a trap and she tells him she's pregnant and he promises never ever but never again to risk his life taking from farmers.  He'll get a respectable job, as a columnist for the local paper, but two years later (12 in fox years) they have a misfit teen and a visiting cousin and Mr. Fox is feeling middle aged and anxious, and itchy for the danger and criminal excitement of stealing poultry.<br /><br />He's a wild animal at heart, he insists, not made to settle down into age and oblivion.  He comes up with a plan, and along with his friend, the possum plumber, plans one last heist, not just any heist but the big one, stealing from the fiercest farmers around: Boggis, Bunce and Bean (you know: one fat, one short, one lean, but uniformly mean).  They don't take it lying down. Mr. Fox's carefree and careless indiscretions turn into an all out war between the farmers and the animals, and everyone will have to work together and set aside rivalries and resentment and hurt feelings.  The danger is real, and they take unnecessary risks, but they have a lot of fun and adventure along the way.<br /><br />I really dig the quirky and stylish vibe of the irresponsibly fantastic Mr. Fox.  Voiced by George Clooney with flair and a fancy whistle and a click, and animated in a silly and stylish retro stop motion approach.  It's a very fun film, and my wife and I loved it and laughed out loud, a lot, but so did our kids (and so, apparently, did lots of others who couldn't stop busting up or exclaiming around us in the theaters).  The film's got something for everyone, and stays true to the feel of Roald Dahl's classic [[ASIN:0142410349 tale]] while giving it the whimsical feel and quirky delights that can only be found in a Wes Anderson film.  The retro-stylish clothing and settings and the family dynamics, especially that between a larger than life but aloof father and a struggling son (played perfectly by Jason Schwartzmann), fit easily into his oeuvre.  I loved the look of the film, the delightful attention to detail, the colors and lighting were perfect, and the deliberately low tech touches, where you could see the ruffling hair and wobbling of water, just add to the charm.  Great stuff, highly recommended.ly into his oeuvre.

B001ACY8D2|4.0|i am surprised that this cd has not received more bad reviews by customers. after reading so many one star reviews for takk.. ( a cd i love) this cd is by far a big step away from what we are used to hearing. but being a person who looves indie pop music, as well as folk and experimental stuff, i cannot complain. i mean if i look at it from the bands perspective they seem to be doing things some listeners wanted them to do, and they are taking a highly evolved indie pop sound and making it much more accessible to a wider audience while still containing the main ingredients that made this band so unique. i do believe they are still unique and i am not going to take them for granted. ive seen good bands go in different directions before and it has always been a painful experience but this time it just really isnt so bad.
1400032717|5.0|This book was simply amazing.  The ability of Mark Haddon to get inside the mind and write from the perspective of a boy with Asperger's Syndrome is quite honestly mindblowing.  I have 2 brothers with the condition who were diagnosed late, and this has given me insight to understand parts of the ways their thought process works.  Short and concise chapters(numbered in primed #s), keep the book very fast paced and your interest locked in.  I found myself disappointed that there wasn't more when I reached the end.

B001G0MFOM|5.0|I was anticipating the DVD when it came before I knew it. The ending was appropriate but I was sad to see the series end. Maybe a reunion or a delayed continuation? One can wish, right? I hoped that the sixth season was longer but I guess the writers and actors were tired of the storyline. Overall, the series was enjoyable and very stimulating!
B0013D8LCW|4.0|This is a really well produced romantic movie, which just happens to be gay themed.  I saw the preview on youtube and was so impressed that I had to buy it from Amazon.  Since I'm watching the DVD outside of the US, the sound level is quite low, I'm not sure if that's due to some incompatibility with my local DVD player (which could play DVD's with different area coding) or other technical glitch.  Well it played well enough on my computer.  O, by the way, almost everybody who's seen this love the happy ending.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|If any one season of Smallville made me feel like I was deeply immersed in Superman mythology and was watching a true, live-action version of a DC comic book, Season Eight was it.<br /><br />Not only is Clark Kent and Lois Lane working at the Daily Planet, but Doomsday, the monster that killed Superman in the comics, is the over-arcing plot this season. He comes in the form of Davis Bloom whom, we learn, experiences these mysterious blackouts as he transforms into the Kryptonian beast and murders anyone that crosses his path.<br /><br />To make matters worse, Davis has a soft spot for Chloe and despite her best intentions, giving in only sets off a chain of events that screws up her relationship with both him and Clark.<br /><br />Also introduced this season--and taking the place of Lex Luthor--is Tess Mercer. At first she's as loyal to the Luthor name as anyone, but when she learns what kind of a man Lex Luthor truly was, everything changes and we encounter a woman who is just as evil as her predecessor.<br /><br />I have to admit I was unsure how Smallville was going to work without Lana Lang and Lex Luthor as key characters, and for the first few episodes, the show did feel a little empty, but that was more than made up for with the breakneck pace the show took and the dark path it led its viewers down while creating the Doomsday saga. With Tess Mercer and Doomsday as the central villains, you forget all about Lex Luthor and instead try to read between the lines to see how he'll one day return as Clark's rightful foe, while watching Tess and Doomsday lead the world into destruction.<br /><br />I was really happy with how this season turned out after my initial skepticism. The episodes were great, the appearances of other DC alumni like Zatanna, Maxima, Jimmy Olsen, the Legion of Superheroes and more just made Season Eight fantastic.<br /><br />Like I always say, this show just keeps getting better and better and I cannot wait to see how everything pans out from here on in. Too cool.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />A.P. Fuchshs
0307454541|3.0|There was a lot in the structure of this book that I liked, most of the charactors, the settings and the mystery involving the young girl. I did not think that all the sex contributed anything to the story. I also thought that the resoluition of the financial angle has already been done one thousand times in movies like Trading Places and the Net.<br /><br />Mikael Blomkvist, the finance writer, was an interesting and good selection to try and resolve an old mystery outside of his field of expertise. Lisbeth Salender was a compelling partner with her talents and faults. Her history though was unbelieveable, better to leave it a mystery.<br /><br />It always annoys when the author goes over the top to sensationalize a charactor or the story for no good reason.  I think that is what happened here. It reads as though somebody said  we just have to add some sex, a full dose of impossible abuse for the young girl, and then to make the entire business family nearly totally crazy.
B001LF2WCC|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  This is by far the best adaptation of one of Frank Miller's graphic novels.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys a good war movie or something historical-related.  One word of caution on the history though, keep in mind that while the general history is preserved in tact this is an adaptation of a GRAPHIC NOVEL, so it is not going to be completely accurate as it is going to have elements of fantasy, most of which is symbolic not historic.  In other words kids, don't base your history essay off the movie; although, there are some wonderful historical commentaries included on the disc which would be of use in a history class essay or research paper.  Just don't forget to footnote.<br /><br />A note on the blu-ray:  The blu-ray is mostly absolutely fantastic.  The movie was shot a little grainy at times on purpose (don't forget, it is supposed to be like watching a graphic novel), and this is most evident when David Wenham's character is relating the story of the movie to the Greek army on the eve of the battle at Plataea.  In those scenes, the graininess is almost a little too distracting.  Other than that, the blu-ray looks magical.
B000002W8O|5.0|It's wonderful! Elvis' Christmas Album has been transferred very well onto CD for all of us to enjoy. Other reviewers note that this is an essential album to own--and they're right! Elvis sings his heart out on these songs and ballads; he's in excellent form here and that's superb! The quality of the sound is excellent and I like that they used the cover art from the original record album.<br /><br />There's a nice mixture of modern day songs and traditional holiday music. The first track, \\"Santa Claus Is Back In Town,\\" has a terrific early rock and roll beat that is gives the song a mellow, relaxed yet joyful mood; and Elvis sings this wonderfully. The backup chorus harmonizes wonderfully--not that Elvis ever needed backup, but they do sound pretty good. Elvis' version of \\"White Christmas\\" is one of the very best I've ever heard; and  \\"Here Comes Santa Claus (Right Down Santa Claus Lane)\\" is joyful, catchy and relentlessly upbeat; Elvis delivers this to perfection--and beyond! I really like \\"Here Comes Santa Claus (Right Down Santa Claus Lane).\\" \\"I'll Be Home for Christmas\\" is one of very favorite holiday songs; and Elvis handles these lyrics like the pro he was and always will be! \\"I'll Be Home for Christmas\\" is surely a charming number.<br /><br />Of course, Elvis shines on the traditional numbers here, too. \\"O Little Town of Bethlehem\\" is quite tender and moving; Elvis never lets go of a single superfluous note and that's grand. \\"(There'll Be) Peace in the Valley (For Me)\\" has a gospel flavor to it that really makes this a standout of the entire album. Elvis sings \\"(There'll Be) Peace in the Valley (For Me)\\" with great sensitivity and just one listen tells you he means it from his heart! The melody perfectly complements Elvis' vocals, too. \\"Take My Hand, Precious Lord\\" shines brighter than silver and gold combined when Elvis performs it; and the album ends with Elvis doing a sublime job on \\"It Is No Secret (What God Can Do).\\" How beautiful!<br /><br />Elvis fans should consider this a must-have for their collections (as if they don't already have this one); and this makes an outstanding addition to anyone's holiday music collection.must-have for their collections (as if they don't already have this one); and this makes an outstanding addition to anyone's holiday music collection.

B002T921AC|5.0|Love, My World, by Justin Bieber. His voice and vocals, are so beautiful. The songs are great, some slow and some fast, a great cd, to dance too. He is so good looking, and that, just magnifeyes, Justin's great talent. The cd, is wonderful. Justin has unlimited talent. I believe Justin, will be a star, for many years, to come. I think Justin, also will be a star, in TV and movies to. I know many people, of all ages, that Love Justin's cd. This cd is, for all ages. This young man, is a magnificent artist, and only 15. I highly recommend, buying the cd. I see there are 3 of the same review, that are one star reviews, they are called, A Kid's Review. They should be removed, by Amazon. They have nothing, to do, with Justin Bieber's cd. A rotten thing,to do, to a 15 year old. Most of the people, that did, the 1 star reviews, have not listened, to the cd. You can tell, by what they say. They are bogus reviews. The cd has,. sold very well. Great job Justin, we love you.
0823004325|5.0|I've actually owned this book once before and lost it. The thing is, as an reference for facial expressions and in general the qualities of the head, I could find none better than this book. So I bought it again. I have seen a lot of books with what might seem to be a wide range of facial expressions, but their the tip of the iceberg. And, if you understand the underlying structure for that expression, then you can more accurately render it from more perspectives. Not that this book is full of anatomy lessons. It has some bone and muscle reference, and it has some relative size reference and it has some block structure building. Over-all its a well balanced, thick, big, comprehensive book. The best I've ever found on the subject.

B001B1UO6W|4.0|Although a remake of this movie is in the works, the original will remain a classic of American horror.  A combination of imaginative writing and playing on our childhood fears of the very things meant to be our benevolent friends. This 20th Birthday Edition has good sound and clear pictures, just don't expect the sterile look of today's CGI effects.
B0026P3G12|4.0|Her recording of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" is not as moving as her rendition on the first round of Britains Got Talent, but it is good.  The best song on the album in my opinion is, \\"Who I Was Born To Be\\", which she sings with more passion...which she should give to all the songs rather than sounding more groomed and proper--that isn't the Susan the world fell in love with that first performance on BGT.
B00004RF9B|5.0|I love this movie.  I have my older version to view.  However, there is an important scene missing.  The scene is the death of Morphius.  In every version available to the public, Morphius runs up to the \\"critter\\" and says, stop.  I disown you.  Then it shifts to the girl hiding her face in the heros shoulder.    I saw this movie when it was a first run movie.  The deleted scene shows the monster picking Morbious up and throwing him.  It can't be that it was too violent because the scene was shown first when an unnamed crewman was picked up by the id monster and thrown.  So, why is it missing in home copies?  I don't know.
0061122416|5.0|Recently, a few people asked me what I think of the book Alchemist and if I would recommend it.  At that instant I thought: what a book that was.  My immediate answer was: Yes, I definitely recommend it.  When I first became aware of this book, my first reaction was who is this author, Paulo Coehlo.  At the time I did not recognize him.  Well, after reading this book (especially this book) and some of his other books after that, it was a memorable reading experience.      The author conveys messages about life, through this simple allegorical story from the perspective of a young shepherd.  While reading the story I found myself thinking about what the author was trying to say and thinking about life.  I found myself thinking about what I would have done if I was in the shepherd's position at different instances in the story.  It was kind of a suspense story, and I had to continue reading to find out more of his message.  It presents philosophy in an easy to understand manner for those lay men like myself who enjoys a good philosophical question at times.  Furthermore I found it inspirational, and for me it was also about the idea of pursuing dreams.      If you enjoy philosophy and are not a philosopher, then I would highly recommend this book.  If you enjoyed reading books by Mitch Albom, then Alchemist is a must read.  Besides being a casual philosopher if you like inspirational self help books, then I would suggest checking out Paulo Coehlo's Alchemist.  I have read some of Paulo Coehlo's other books after reading this one.    Well, I would suggest reading this book, and let me know what you think of the Alchemist after you read it.  I hope you enjoy the book as much as I did.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I just played this cd for the first time and WOW! The heart and soul that this beautiful woman conveys with her God given voice is heartwarming and brings tears to my eyes. She is truly a superstar and I would gladly have paid a $100 for her debut album so for the $9.99 price it is a excellent deal. My words cannot begin to do justice in describing just how great Susan Boyle is and that she is a superstar for this era.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|There is nothing much to say that has not been covered in other reviews or the product summary by Amazon or even the TV Guide or another entertainment guide's review. \\"Castle\\" is a plain out overall fun murder mystery show. Everything from the actors (the always underrated Nathan Fillion and the always lovely Stana Katic), the murders and the dialogue are fresh. I am not saying fresh in the sense that the series has re-invented the wheel, but fresh compared to over serious and seriously OVER/DONE/CANCEL ALREADY crime shows out there like \\"CSI\\", \\"NCSI\\" and \\"Law & Order\\" (all spin offs included). The thing that works for this show is the humor combined with the dialogue and the playful chemistry of the stars. It almost reminds me of the playful nature of \\"Ellery Queen\\" (thanks to re-runs on A&E I can reference that), \\"Nero Wolfe\\" or even earlier \\"Murder, She Wrote\\" episodes.    Bottom line the series is a good time that helps you take your mind off of the real world around you and to me that is good solid entertainment.     The DVD set has your standard transfer. Everything looks good, at least for me I have not seen anything wrong.  The audio when piped through a surround sound system is all there (like I said standard stuff). I honestly can say if there is one complaint I have with anything here it is the opening DVD menu. Being a Graphic Designer, I just feel that the title should fade in like it does, the pen should come in on the A, title fades out and menu commands come up. Instead the pen shows up on the left and stay, the title is just in and out with no pen motion and the menu commands come up. I am using this as an example of how I find nothing wrong with this set at all and need at least one thing to complain about.     I feel that this will be an excellent addition to any crime show/murder mystery fan or someone who is just looking for a fun show to watch.
B001L4NJIO|5.0|I went on Cnet and was looking for the best movies on DVD. They had a 30 must own blu-ray reviews. The only concert was The Police certifiable. Im not a Sting fan but for $10 I figured why not! I own a THX certified 7.1 system. The picture is so clear I could see the hairs on Stings arms (Panasonic V10). The sound is phenomenal! I cranked up the volume by choice because it sounded so clear. I was truely entertained by this Blu-ray concert and now agree with Cnet this is one for the collection. I cant wait to have some friends over to enjoy a great concert with a clear picture and sound. My home theater has a multitude of adjustments and it sounded terrific without tweaking. If I spent the time to dial in a better picture and sound Im sure I could blow away some other of my favorite concerts on DVD. You can see exerpts on you tube before you buy and decide before you buy. I think your going to enjoy the show the \\"old guys\\" put on.

B0026P3G12|5.0|I just received my copy of the cd about an hour ago and sat and listened to it.  Susan Boyle is no doubt the greatest singer in the world.  I was moved and touched by all the songs.  However, my copy of the cd sounded scratchy, not like the samples on this Amazon site, not like the internet, and not like the tv.  I'm wondering if it's my stereo or if I got a bad copy.  Anyone else have this problem?  Nevertheless her beautiful voice comes through, even though it sounds a little like a 78 rpm record.  Later I downloaded the MP3 and it is much better than the CD, does not have the noisy equipment sound.  The MP3 version is equisitely sweet beauty.   The most beautiful voice in the world, no contest.

A masterful CD. I'm playing it as I type this ... Amazing Grace ... and, as always, the tears do start to well up.      Susan Boyle is no flash-in-the-pan. Not by a long shot !!
B00003CXB4|5.0|The Lion King is one of the greatest cinematic achievements of our time. The message is universal, the music inspiring. Creating this masterpiece was an endeavor well merited for reverence; the eternal message that we are all one, each one of us connected by the great circle of life is enlightening, inspiring, and intrinsic to remembering who we are and who we are together. This movie resonates with anyone and everyone who innately feel connected to the life of this world, to every creature, every plant, every organism, to the very breath of life. This movie is a reminder to never forget who we truly are and to recognize, to embrace our place in this world. With a splash of humor that both adults and children can appreciate and a message of true love and infallible friendship this movie satisfies all endearing elements of a masterpiece. The Lion King is full of witty lines which are also educational such as when Zazu tells Mufasa that the elephants remember, they couldn't forget - elephants are revered for being unique to the animal kingdom for their capacity to remember things over long periods of time- or when Scar says it's the lioness' job to do the hunting, that's true, in the wild the female lions are the one's that hunt and bring back food for their pride. You can never go wrong with the humor of Timon and Pumbaa whose comedic genius brighten the movie with witty jokes that keep you laughing. There's always the infinite wisdom of Rafiki that resonates within the heart of us all when he reminds Simba that, \\"you don't even know who you are.\\" Mufasa teaches Simba that, \\"you must take your place in the great circle of life...you have forgotten who you are and so have forgotten me... remember who you are. Remember. Remember. Remember.\\" This story is inspiring, enlightening, humorous, and universal. I'm sure it's message will permeate this universe for ever. I have yet to meet a person who does not appreciate this movie, and if you have yet to experience this masterpiece for yourself you are in for delightful entertainment that can only be delivered by a Disney Classic, a Disney Masterpiece. Enjoy.
0141023570|5.0|'Of Mice and Men' was written in 1937 by John Steinbeck. To me, one of his finest works.<br /><br />The setting is in the Gabilan mountain area of western California and although no specific dates are mentioned, probably around the time of the great depression. The two main protagonists are George and Lennie, two drifters that travel the area looking for seasonal work at harvest time. George is a small cunning man while Lennie is giant of a man, but with the mind of a child. Their wandering lifestyle is fueled by their dreaming about better days ahead and having their own place...as Lennie puts it, \\"Can you imagine such a place, living off the fat of the lan'?\\". However their future is about to drastically change in ways they can never suspect (or understand) and the dream is about to be shattered forever.<br /><br />Subjectively, I loved it all; the finest of writing, that not only features exquisite  descriptive passages of barns, horses and of lazy, late summertime afternoons, but also the unique characters that go into making this depression era tale. And although the book is really just a longer, short story (just over 100 pages in length) it is the ever-so subtle increasing tension coupled with the real personalities, that makes this wonderful novel so hard to put down.<br /><br />If any complaint, it would be that the tale is so short; it's all over almost as soon as it's begun.  However, it's quality over quantity.  Easily, 5 Stars.<br /><br />Ray Nicholson
B00065MDRW|5.0|This album is an absolute landmark. All it takes is one listen to the opening track, \\"21st Century Schizoid Man,\\" to realize just how ahead of their time this band was. This song, recorded in 1969, foreshadows the heavy rock and metal of the 80's and 90's... twenty years beforehand. Everyone from Nirvana to Tool to Mudvayne lists this band as an influence, and this song shows why. The other tracks don't disappoint either. Though \\"I Talk To The Wind\\" sounds much like other 60's psychedelic rock, it is so well executed that one can hardly fault it. \\"Epitaph\\" and \\"Moonchild\\" are brilliant, haunting pieces that solidify the middle portion of the album. However, the real magnum opus is the title track, \\"The Court of the Crimson King.\\" With it's fantastic lyrics and amazing vocals, this song is the perfect closer for a nearly perfect album. This album may very well be King Crimson's best work. If I had to list my top ten favorite albums, this would be near the top of the list. A must listen from an incredible band.

I wish she would rewrite the fourth book leaving off from the third one.  This really disappointed me and was so far off.  It somewhat ruined the whole story for me.....what a waste!  Stephanie - do yourself and the characters a favor and redo the fourth!  This is nothing like the other three at all!  The pregnancy was stupid.  You could have made such a great story from the wedding to the honeymoon and then make Bella \\"turning\\" so much more.  I feel like rewriting the story myself of how it should be.............<br /><br />I would change my views if this book was redone...........
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I own a copy of Pesuasion with Amanda Root, which is very good.  But this!  This version is by far my favorite.  I agree, the Austen purist will probably hate it.  But this version is so very well done, and in my opinion, a much better version than the other (Root version).  the last scene in which Anne accepts the Captain's proposal, i back it up and watch it over and over and over again!  This version i do not own, i keep checking it out from my local library.  It's on my amazon wish list and I will buy it soon.  Men these days don't have a clue what sets a true romantic's heart to racing.  I was surely born 150 years too late.  And I agree with another poster, this captain wentworth is smokin hot which makes it that much better.

B0026P3G12|5.0|\\"Wild Horses\\" is lovely, especially to begin the album; however, Susan's rendition of all the other songs is outstanding too, right through \\"Silent Night.\\"  She is every bit as good as other popular singers who are performing today.  Listen to the entire album with the finest Bose headphones or speakers, and you will hear how truly excellent she is.  Indeed, she should be very proud of what she has accomplished with this first album, and so far in her new career.  Lots of us love her, and wish her only great happiness and the very best in the months and years to come.  Simon Cowell is to be praised for giving her a chance and enabling her to get this far.  This album is well worth the price; and hopefully there will be many more like it from the very special, talented and lovely Susan in the future.

B00288KNJU|5.0|I bought this for my daughter after she watched it at my mom's house and was facinated my it.  She's watched this movie soooooo many times and is completely engulfed in it when it's on.  She's 3.5 years old and does not scare easily, but I think it could be scarry for some kids that age.  I've watched it a few times with her and also enjoyed it.  The story line is very unique and the animation is very creative, we would definitally recommend this movie for kids that have creative minds.

B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle's spectacular debut CD communicates her life and soul through an amazing collection of songs, delivered by her heavenly and richly varied voice in tones ranging from worshipful to tender to poignant to heartwrenching to magnificently soaring.  Her God-given talent is marvelously displayed.  Susan's story is like a parable for these times, giving hope that the God Who is working in her life can also work in yours.  You and everyone on your Christmas gift list will listen to this incredible album over and over and over again.  Bravo, Susan!

0684833395|4.0|What is there to say about a book that so many before me have reviewed? My take on Catch-22 is that it is hilarious, eye-opening, and a bit disturbing (but just a bit). I couldn't put it down for the first couple hundred pages.<br /><br />But it got repetitive. I don't care to pick at classics, so I won't. Should everyone read this book? Yes. Was it good? Yes, I would say 3.5 out of 5 stars. I would give it more, but there comes a point where it just drags...and drags...and drags. The version I have is 453 pages and I think I could have done without 150-200 of those pages. I did, thankfully, enjoy the ending--I went from hating Yossarian, the main character, at the beginning of the book, to not being sure how I felt about him, to actually kind of liking him at the very end.
B000056N8X|2.0|I read another review describing \\"Endgame\\" as a \\"complete waste of potential.\\"  That pretty well hits the nail on the head.

B002BZOVLG|5.0|I've begun collecting opera on bluray the last several months, with mixed results. As for Mozart, I bought the Don Giovanni directed by Francesca Zambello, which is terrific, and The Marriage Of Figaro directed by Claus Guth, which is a travesty. This production of Cosi, directed by the theatre director Nicholas Hytner is better than them all, and is one of the best opera dvds I've ever seen. As the previous reviewer said, merely by being traditional, this Cosi is more meaningful and subversive than any \\"reinterpreted\\" version could be. Highly recommended!
B002QGUFWE|1.0|I love this CD but Amazon sent me a edited copy! It doesn't say anywhere on the page that it is edited and I'm certainly NOT happy. So what to do now? Will Amazon send me another copy that isn't edited? Doubt it. So I'll probably end up spending more money buying a unedited copy.

The tapes are recordings made by a girl that committed suicide just weeks before. On the tapes she names thirteen reasons why she decided to kill herself.

I am going to tell many people about this book. We have so much to learn from this story...
0316069906|5.0|The consumption of flesh for food has always played a central role in a people's culinary heritage.  For our ancestors, it not only supplied them with much needed nourishment, but also served as a cultural repository for the values they placed on food preparation, flavor, and community. For instance, when the Pilgrims first congregated for that landmark Thanksgiving dinner--served with a plethora of wild fowl, game, and grain--they partook of the American landscape's rich bounty that would provide them sustenance for those first, precarious years at the East Coast settlements. In 21st century, urban communities, most dinner parties would go amiss if a roasted animal, handsomely browned and splayed on a carving board, were absent from the menu.     However, the practice of eating meat has repeatedly and increasingly been a source of debate for vegetarians and animal activists, all of whom point out the practices of an industry that elevate profit above quality, animal welfare, and consumer health.  Is it wrong to eat turkey if there exists its soy alternative, Tofurkey?  For the conscientious omnivore, for whom battery farm chicken raises much contention, would it not be more prudent to favor its extravagantly priced yet humanely raised alternative, the mouthwatering Poulet Bresse (which costs around $21 a kilo)?  If steaks from corn-fed, gridlocked cows offend the discerning epicure, why not buy beef sliced from the pampered, beer-inebriated animals of wagyu cattle breeders?  Or, for the staunchest and most daring of us, why eat meat at all?     Jonathan Safran Foer, the critically acclaimed novelist of the widely loved Everything is Illuminated and the equally compelling Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, poses these important questions and challenges in Eating Animals--a postmodern memoir about vegetarianism furnished with his trademark narrative sparkle and a litter of philosophical patter from legendary non-carnivores like Franz Kafka and Jacques Derrida.  Forthe adventurous cook, it also features a Filipino recipe for \\"Stewed Dog, Wedding Style.\\"     It should be noted that Mr. Foer is hardly shy about donning his dietary preferences.  In his debut novel, his self-named hero is offered an unending selection of meats by Alexander Perchov's grandfather, all of which he persistently refuses.  In Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, the main character Oskar Schell declares that he doesn't eat \\"anything with parents.\\" Eating Animals, his premier work of nonfiction, is even more poised towards outlining his evolving stances on dietary views.     While this book revolves around the ethics of eating meat, Foer consciously tells us that this is not a \\"straightforward case for vegetarianism.\\"  Like most works of investigative journalism, it stands as a by-product of mountains of research, observations, and interviews, much of which feature here as honest essays and reportages from cattle and poultry farmers, animal rights activists, and vegetarians.  But unlike most memoirs of this sort, it departs from convention by including evocative stories, myths, and folktales and lengthy philosophical discussions, much of which dwell on the visceral horrors of slaughterhouses and factory farming.      Mr. Foer writes that most chickens have been bioengineered to yield more meat in less time while living cooped up in the \\"grossly unnatural,\\" cramped conditions of battery farms, leading not only to reduction in their bone density, but also to bacterial infection, lung and heart conditions, cancerous tumors, and skin diseases. He tells us that pigs are sardined in closed barns littered with \\"stillborn piglets, afterbirths, dead piglets, vomit, blood, urine, antibiotic syringes, broken bottles of insecticide, hair, pus, even body parts.\\"  He informs us that farmed fish like salmon are raised in filthy tanks infested with sea lice that gnaw their flesh to the bone.  And he says that cattle, considered here as the most fortunate among livestock, run through most slaughterhouses being \\"bled, skinned, and dismembered while still conscious.\\"     If that were not gruesome enough, he even suggests that industrial farming plays consumers into a deceptive game that, while copiously providing them with cheap meat, doubly compromises their health and the planet's ecology.  By raising chickens in terrible conditions, farmers cross-contaminate flocks with deadly bacteria like salmonella, campylobacter, and E. coli.  Pigs don't fare much better on the ecological scale.  Foer tells us that in communities built close to piggeries, where massive, noxious cesspools are reserved for storing livestock manure, people are constantly sick due to the toxins (transported through air or soil) contained in pig scat.     As a result of these inhumane farming practices, the animals are not only more prone to disease, but also develop certain, hybridized pathogens that have orchestrated several disastrous epidemics like SARS, MRSA, H5N1, and the more recent H1N1 flu. And when animal veterinarians administer medicine to weak battery farm animals, they are not only artificially prolonging their lives, but are also indirectly passing drugs that make our bodies vulnerable to bacteria evolved to bear the brunt of antibiotics.     Certainly, these facts are startling, and if they don't proselytize foodies into shunning meat, they at least inform the reader about the flaws of an order that disregards the consumer for the sake of profit.  Readers will readily agree about the injustices of a system where \\"more than half a billion of our tax dollars are given to the dairy, beef, egg, and poultry industries\\" to provide food to children while \\"a modest $161 million is offered to buy fruits and vegetables that even the USDA admits we should eat more of.\\"  It is unnecessary to argue about such a case where externalized costs and unhealthy consequences impact society more heavily than the savings levied on our wallets.  This isn't only an argumentfor vegetarianism, but moreover, an \\"argument for another, wise animal agriculture and more honorable omnivory.\\"     Alas, like most books about vegetarianism, this sincerely written memoir is not without its share of sensationalized. off-putting statements that may distract readers from key points.  Sentences like \\"KFC is arguably the company that has increased the sum total of suffering in the world more than any other in history\\" (his grandmother survived the Nazi onslaught) and comparisons of battery farming to heinous crimes like slavery and abortion definitely place into question Mr. Foer's sense of ethical priority.  And while the unmistakably postmodern illustrations on the chapter openings challenge readers to ponder on their accompanying inscriptions, these cutesy effects skew the gravity of the subject and undermine the seriousness of his valid observations.  At least those pages only number but a small fraction in this memoir.     Mr. Foer acknowledges that \\"nothing establishes friendship so forcefully as eating together,\\" and even informs us that he, at one point, enjoyed the delights of sushi and steak with friends and family.  He also realizes that \\"changing what we eat and letting tastes fade from memory create a kind of cultural loss, a forgetting.\\"  But he also recognizes that his conscious decision to jettison meat from his diet is a crucial manifesto on sustainability, on charitableness, and ultimately, on social responsibility. Although Eating Animals remains only a partially tenable argument against the intractable practice of consuming meat, it nonetheless reminds us about the importance of not letting our self-interests supplant the welfare of others, including animals.

0870703781|5.0|Arriving early in 1972 for a Job in Statesboro, Georgia, from Europe as \\"an immigrant with a passport\\" these images strike me as well done observations. Many times in the early morning I had mental snapshots of the beautiful lighting and the high humidity that often appeared to act as a \\"soft filter\\" and I see that effect in these images as well. So, in addition to being excellent photographs, they are also a time machine from \\"when things were slower and fewer.\\"<br />But I also sense that Eggleston is one of the few that still enjoyed a somewhat Patrician upbringing from an era gone by, (The Spoiled Squires of the South) and his images are those of an observer and not a participant. I like the quality of these images that don't have the linear and often harsh quality of digital photography, but the constant and repeated mantras in reviews of this book that Eggleston was a pioneer in color photography are bogus. Others were shooting in color as well, its the exclusionary gallery culture at work here creating their own tall tales.<br />The front introductory section written by John Szarkowski is for me an entirely separate part of the book and makes for good reading, altough I find the constant name dropping and tortured language that rambles on more of an attempt by John Z to show off his knowledge of photography and how he defines Eggleston's work, and that we readers are mere minions. Enough said, those are my viewpoints. Buy the book and check it out for yourself.

The songs on this album are definitely more complicated than the songs on his first album (musically and lyrically), and show his growth as a songwriter. The best part is that they still have that Mika sound to them, and they are witty, fun, but still beautifully written. The diversity and importance of these songs make this album very unique. Mika continues to inspire me and awe me with his brilliant music.

B000001ESF|1.0|After reading the lyric sheet, especially to side 1, I had to laugh. This isn't comedy is it ? After the dopey, much too long instrumental, the 'story' starts like a bad sci-fi movie & goes downhill from there. It meanders like crazy, all too apparently trying to burn up time.  Our \\"hero\\" is a puss, who dreams & cries, cries & dreams some more, wah wah wah. Supposedly, he kills himself because the bad guys win. Life sucks now in a world with no freedom nor imagination. Rush are like the bad guys, they have no imagination.     The singer sounds like a girl, the guitar player can only play atonal solos completely lacking any musicality & the drumming exists, nothing more.    I heard Rush was called the thinking man's band. That's true if you think that gazing at your navel lint can lead to a profound experience.
B0018KSB5C|4.0|I loved Spider Man 1 and 2.  I had to have Spider Man 3, but it was not that great. First spiderman and Green Goblin act like BFF's.

Otherwise it is pretty enjoyable.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|Always set the DVR to record this fasinating, addictive series filled with the original and funny characters, including a milk cow named \\"Jean\\".

Surprisingly appealing even to us that are not diehard fans of the traditional Sci-Fi genre.

Those songs that are more conducive to a crooning style come off best as well as the rip roaring and hilarious 'Must be Santa'. Cringeworthy however is Dylan's mauling of the latin lyrics in Adeste Fideles/Oh Come all ye faithful. Only Dylan could get away with this and it shows him to be independent enough to sing what he wants and enjoy doing so. That said, some of the singing is barely that with a great deal of gravel in the delivery.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I am not one to like exercise dvd's but had to try it given the great reviews.  It is really that good.  The exercises are simple but focus on keeping the heartrate up through strength and cardio for 20 minutes = jumping jacks, squats, etc.  I have only done level one.  Within 4 minutes of starting this dvd, I am sweating hard but in a good way.  unlike other dvd's, it is easy to make it through it because the moves are simple and any time you feel like quitting, you realize you can make it 20 minutes.  the time passes really quickly and it felt like it made me more toned after only one day. Jillian is very easy to be motivated by.  I recommend two sets of weights for beginners like me, 2 lbs and 8 lbs.  I only have 8 lbs and the exercises are too hard to make it through.

0061730327|5.0|The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind is an intriguing story about a bow living in impoverished Malawi, Africa. The son of a poor farming family William Kamkwamba struggles his entire young life just to survive. They rely on their annual crops to provide enough maize to last them the entire year till the next crops are harvested.    While he isn't helping his father in the fields he and his cousin Geoffrey spent their time repairing radios. But one of the major problems that they had was finding good batteries. Since there was no electricity and no modern technology of that kind the supply of batteries was extremely limited. Using a bicycle dynamo he manages to replace those precious batteries. This discovery led to his biggest invention. This invention led to his successive fame. In the midst of many different hardships he plows onward to see his goals put in to place.    The imagery is fantastic; one can almost smell the nsima in a few parts of the book. Just the inspiration that this book invokes in a person is worth while. Reading of a boy that overcame so very many challenges to get to this point is amazing. This is a very good read that I highly recommend to everyone.

What I did not know is that I would find an artist whose energy, emotions and soul could blend seamlessly into her music and lyrics. Every beat of the drum and every high and low note echoes in my mind, making my body tingle and my heart stop. Florence has managed to create her own genre of British folk music with every word jumping and reaching out to the listener. She has entrapped me with her voice and intensity, and I never want to be released from her spell. This is definitely the best album of the year and this is what music should be. Music should lift you up, take you down, and make your whole body freeze in wonder. Thank you Florence for your gift and for your love.

0385532458|4.0|In an episode of the TV show, 3rd Rock From The Sun, the Soloman's are sitting in a living room reading books, Dick asks what the others are reading, they reply, the \\"new John Grisham about the idealistic young lawyer\\" and they all switch books. That's the way I've felt about John Grisham's novels, they're fast paced, keep the reader turning the pages, with a chase followed by an explosion, there wasn't much depth to the characters, and the books will entertain you for an afternoon, but after you're done there's not much left to hang onto, they were interchangeable. With Ford County, Grisham plants those literary roots and takes hold, trading fast food for a feast.<br /><br />In Ford County Grisham doesn't stray too far from his legal roots, most of the characters are lawyers, plantiffs, defendants or people suffering repercussions of the legal system. The difference from his other novels, he adds depth to the characters. The plots of the stories in Ford County are all character driven and Grisham adds dramatic tension and emotion of the characters.  and the situations which might at first seem to have simple answers don't seem as easy as when you started the story.<br /><br />All of the stories in Ford County have their own attraction. Blood Drive gives an altogether different meaning to the phrase and shows how the best of intentions can go all to hell in a short amount of time. Fish Files posits the theory that for lawyers, divorce is the way to realize all your dreams of success. Fetching Raymond and Michael's Room are two stories that the characters are really well drawn and create their own tension. And they'll really turn your head around and leave you thinking because the situations at the end aren't as easily resolvable as at the beginning and leave you wondering who is right and who is wrong in the situations the characters find themselves in.<br /><br />Am I a literary snob? Yes. So is Grisham. He's cited William Faulkner as an influence for years, but his novels haven't lived up to the literary standard he wants to emulate. In the last story, Funny Boy, Grisham challenges those ideas and seemingly takes on Thomas Wolfe's dictum \\"that you can't go home again.\\" Funny Boy shows that bigotry hasn't disappeared but has evolved. It's not the bigotry of race but of ignorance, and the main characters discover they have some things in common they might not have otherwise realized. Grisham invokes Faulkner in the story, and the understanding and empathy the characters discover in each other are worthy of the Faulkner allusion.<br /><br />I don't think John Grisham's fans will be disappointed with these short stories, although, the stories are slower paced than his novels. And people who heretofore avoided Grisham will be pleasantly surprised at the discovery of the writer within John Grisham.up to the literary standard he wants to emulate. In the last story, Funny Boy, Grisham challenges those ideas and seemingly takes on Thomas Wolfe's dictum \\"that you can't go home again.\\" Funny Boy shows that bigotry hasn't disappeared but has evolved. It's not the bigotry of race but of ignorance, and the main characters discover they have some things in common they might not have otherwise realized. Grisham invokes Faulkner in the story, and the understanding and empathy the characters discover in each other are worthy of the Faulkner allusion.    I don't think John Grisham's fans will be disappointed with these short stories, although, the stories are slower paced than his novels. And people who heretofore avoided Grisham will be pleasantly surprised at the discovery of the writer within John Grisham.

0066620996|5.0|After having read, Built to Last, I was convinced that Jim Collins had written the most important book about business in the last 15 years.  After reading Good to Great, I realized I was wrong.  Jim Collins has a true talent for taking the most important and deeply misunderstood concepts in business and showing people how they work.      One of the most interesting aspects of this book is that it shines a light on the face of many management teams.  This light is not always welcome.  I was surprised that most of the people I talked to after having read this book felt that they were doing the things a visionary leader should be doing.  It goes to show that the devil can quote the Bible for his own purposes.      The biggest take aways I found in this book were focused on the concepts for doing ONE thing and doing it well and with \\"Rinsing the Cottage Cheese\\".  I believe that if many companies would focus on one thing and then refine the processes for doing it really well, then there would be more truly great organizations in the world.
B0014I4KH6|4.0|We have not listened to the Cd yet(christmas present), but it did come nicely packaged, and in good shape.
B002VKE1K2|5.0|I am a fan of horror films and suspense films. I've seen just about every kind from slasher movies like Nightmare on Elm Street to the classics like Psycho. I soon realized that it is the old classic movies, especially by Alfred Hitchcock, that truly could keep me awake at all hours of the night listening to every creak and groan.    Nowadays audiences don't see true suspense anymores, we don't have simple shadowy figures that haunt us or terrified thrill of anticipation. Horror has been replaced with gore, blood and mythic monsters like Jason or Freddy Kruegar which seem to me, too fantastic to be scary. While watching a person being decapitated may be disturbing, it isn't truly terrifying and often times these CGI effects are inaccurate and ruin the thrill.    Hitchcock knew that it was the anticipation and our own imagination that trully terrified us. It wasn't actually seeing the monster but just imagining it that would get the hair rising on the back of our necks. Anticipating and wondering what would happen next was what truly scared us more than actually seeing it in action. Because our imagination gives us a wealth of knowledge and we will draw upon our own fears, what scares one person will not always scare the next. Mythic monsters like Jason will only frighten those who ARE afraid of him...what about those who aren't. But if the monster has no face...then everyone will imagine the worst.    That is beauty of Paranormal Activity. I had truly believed I was done being frightened by \\"horror\\" movies because all of the monsters were alike. Then I decided to see this one...and I didn't sleep a wink the night afterwards.    There are no special effects, no CGI, no music and no gore, just actors the eerieness of night and the door swinging open, the rest is left to be filled by our own fears. We don't need to see the demon to be terrified, we just have to be left wondering what will happen next and then our own horror gives way to keep us chilled to our bones.The sad thing is that too much CGI has robbed some people of truly appreciating their own fears. I remember arguing with someone after this movie was released who said, \\"What is so terrifying about a door opening?\\" My response was simple, \\"There is nothing scary about a door swinging open, but it is the knowledge that something is going to happen, our own wonderings and fears about what will happen next...that is what is terrfying.\\"    I was shaking all the way home after seeing this movie, every whisper, every thump sent chills down my spine because I never actually got to see what was haunting this couple. Because of this, I was left wondering and this way I will never be disappointed because my own imagination can ALWAYS come up with something far scarier than Fredd Kruegar or Jason could ever be.    Fans of blood and gore will not like this movie, they do not want to take the time to let their imagination truly terrify them. Those who remember the classic Hitchcock films will celebrate that some people do remember that sometimes there is more to horror than just disembowling someone...sometimes it is simply what we cannot see that will haunt our nightmares.
0470477237|5.0|I LOVE this book [[ASIN:0470477237 Socialnomics: How social media transforms the way we live and do business]].  I'm a marketing consultant and am working to get ahead of the curve on social media and how best to utilize these new tools.  This is the first book I've read where I've been able to get my brain wrapped around all of it and could begin to see how to apply it to the business world - for myself and for my clients.  The easy to understand examples and the way the information is presented makes it a great read
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This is just plain fun. There are a lot of Star Wars similarities and the bonus material even mentions it. Leaves you wondering how they're going to straighten out all the time space continuum stuff they messed up in this movie. But no need to think to much, just sit back and watch the good guys take on the bad guys. There are a lot of subtle references and reminders of other space movies, mayby some borrowng from Star Wars. You'll recognize the similar scenes.

B0017M8XS6|3.0|The album itself is five stars, but the primates let loose to remaster this bring it down to three.  Now, I like the strong presentation of the midrange that SACD renders, but the midrange on this SACD is so inordinately exaggerated that it is almost unlistenable.  If you have two-way speakers and are slightly tone deaf to midrange frequencies, then this mix might work for you.  However, if you have normal sensitivity to midrange frequencies AND a dedicate midrange on three-way speakers, then this is a far, far cry from what this music is supposed to sound like.  The loudness issue rears its ugly head as well, but even that pales to what these monkeys did to the midrange.<br /><br />If you are an audiophile, you may want to track down the dvd-audio of this album instead.  My only hope is that, once again, Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs will step up to the plate and show everyone how a remaster is supposed to be done.  I normally refrain from scathing reviews as I would like to give the potential target of my ire the benefit of the doubt, but there is no doubt here.  If this was intended for audiophiles, then this remaster is unforgivable.
B000244FDW|5.0|I love this movie!!!!  The dvd had scenes that were not in my VHS tape!  This is a timeless story, and although there have been other productions of this wonderful book, in my opinion, this is the best one made.  Sticks the closest to the novel.  I highly recommend this.
0743289692|5.0|This book is great and eye opening about a world we know little about. It makes me sad that she throws any belief in God out the window. For her, it is either the god of Islam or no God.   The abuse against women in the culture she grew up in is very disturbing and should not be ignored by anyone!Islam's violence against unbelievers is also troubling.  Good read.
B002TX06RI|5.0|The show is entertaining and addictive.  The interaction of the characters is what makes this show a must see.  The two lead characters work together to solve white collar crimes, one is FBI, the other is former (or maybe still practicing) criminal on a work release. There is a light touch of comedy in their communications with each other.  They both work well together and are learning the perspective of the 'other side' from each other as they solve the crime.  Both characters have appeal.  Neal easily stretches the rules to get what he wants, Peter goes by the rules. But you can see Peter working on Neal to keep things legal, and Neal's  pushing Peter towards the boundary edge of the rules.  Peter is likable, very clever, by the book, knows a lot about Neal and is good at figuring out what Neal is up to. Neal is clever and has his own agenda that he conceals from Peter (or does he?), which is part of a story arc mystery for the first season. These two, Neal and Peter, respect each other, and work as partners, but the game is on between them. You are also treated to gorgeous shots of New York that make a beautiful backdrop when these guys go outside. I watched the first five episodes so far (and rewatched the episodes too) and look forward to the next ones because its that good.
1582701709|1.0|This book is a very short read...about 45 minutes. And I am glad i bought it used on ebay because it really is not worth its price.<br /><br />The book has very little useful information. The hype surrounding this book is comical at best. The author, who we know nothing about, suddenly inherets this book that tells her the secret to getting anything you want in life. Mainly by asking the universe, and waiting to receive it, all the while thinking positvely. If your still with me ill explain how this is such a dangerous book.<br /><br />I have nothing wrong with self help books. But people miss what they are about...self...help! What really sets the most successful people apart from every other Joe Smith is that they have such an intense desire to get whatever it is they want that they fully commit to getting it and work harder than anyone before them. Sure, they make a few mistakes, but they learn from them and become stronger.<br /><br />The Secret is what our society is so used to. Ask someone, like Jesus or the universe, to bring it to you and you shall receive. This creates spiritual laziness, that encompasses our whole life and makes us feel that we aren't strong or worthy enough to change our own situation.<br /><br />Sure thinking positvely is beneficial, and necessary to achieving your goal. But without work we get nothing.<br /><br />One quote in this book about money was to \\"think and act in a way as if you are already prosperous.\\" Really?? Isn't that how we ended up in this financial crisis? Years of \\"thinking\\" we have enough money? I dont belive we should upset ourselves to where we end up sick over our situation, but this book offers nothing tangible.<br /><br />I do believe in the law of attraction. I do believe that our thinking is one of our greatest obstacles. But with proper mind/awareness training, mainly through meditation and psycology, we can understand ourselves better and become aware of what makes us suffer, be it our financial situation, relationship status, or general happiness. This book offers nothing that would REALLY develop that.book offers nothing that would REALLY develop that.
B002IVLH60|4.0|This disc is a great listen. I thought \\"Pearl Jam\\" was solid and showed a lot of growth for PJ as a band. I think \\"Backspacer\\" is even better, especially considering the variety of sounds found on the disc. While they certainly aren't the same band as when they put out \\"Ten\\", \\"Vs\\", or \\"Vitalogy\\", they've grown into a great adult grunge/alternative listen. I especially hear and appreciate the classic rock rift infusions found throughout their newer music.    All in all, I still long for PJ's early 90s grunge, but the music on \\"Backspacer\\" certainly doesn't disappoint.
6304698690|3.0|Below I compare and contrast the three color adaptations.<br /><br />1. The 1975 adaptation BBC<br /><br />This adaptation is very low budgeted, and it shows in the picture quality, which is painful even if you are used to BBC 4.3 aspect ratio films. This said, the film is quite good in every other way if loyalty in plot is important to you. For example, Mr. Archibald Craven, Ben W., Martha, Martha's mother, etc. are given larger roles in this adaptation than in the 1987 and 1993 adaptations. Furthermore, a considerably amount of the dialogue is taken directly from the novel. Therefore, this adaptation is much less 'sound bites' and allows for the development of Mary, Dickon, and Collin's characters.<br /><br />The acting is also considerably better than the 1987 adaptation and better than the 1993 adaptation. [Unfortunately, with child actors of probably 10 or 11 years of age who have memorize a large amount of script, errors will be evident.]<br /><br />Yet, the 1975 adaptation is the best adaptation in my opinion. It is neither too mystical (1993) nor too gothic (1987). I just is the story of a family and a garden that brings them together.<br /><br />2. The 1987 adaptation Hallmark<br /><br />Although I know many individuals despise this adaptation, I enjoyed it for a change. Yes, the acting is not perfect and the accents are horrible. Yes, the ending is pathetic and quite changed from the novel. Yes, Dickon (as an adult) dies in World War II. Yet, when one considers what the film was trying to achieve (i.e. change the theme from a children's story to a social critique of problems in society), it does an effective job. The film is a little too gothic (in the Victorian literature definition -i.e. 'ghosts' and long, dark corridors), yet I did not think the gothic harmed the story but rather created a sense of anticipation.<br /><br />Again, if you want a loyal adaptation, I would urge the the 1975 adaptation. However, if you are tired of watching the 1975 adaptation and want to see a change, this 1987 adaptation is a better choice than the 1993 adaptation.<br /><br />3. The 1993 adaptation Time Warner<br /><br />I disliked this adaptation. My first problem was that Mary's parents were killed in an earthquake rather than a plague. (I am not certain what this proved?). Secondly, the mystical music was annoying as were the inappropriate accents - although of the two, I could tolerate the poor accents much more than the poor music.<br /><br />Additionally, other scenes were also altered. For example, Mary finds the key to the garden in her deceased aunt's bedroom in the shut up wing of the Manor. In the 1975 adaptation (and I think the 1987 adaptation also), Mary finds the key buried with some help from a robin. However, the robin does show Mary where the door to the garden is located.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the other problem I have with this film is that it is centered almost exclusively on Mary's character. Where the 1975 adaptation provides other characters (ex: Martha, Dr. Craven, Sir Archibald Craven, and Martha's mother have with numerous scenes in which Mary does not appear.) In the Warner adaptation, Mary is the focus of nearly every scene.<br /><br />Also, Collin's character was considerably altered into less dictatorial that in the novel the other film adaptations. In fact, at times, Collin appears very childish and timid - terrified of dying and of Mrs. Medlock (rather than bossing Mrs. Medlock, his nurse, and everyone else around). Why Mrs. Medlock and the whole staff of of the Manor had to wear masks when around Collin, I have not a clue? (I forget if everyone wearing a mask was in the novel or not, but it makes no sense in this film adaptation.)<br /><br />However, the film does have some positives. The Manor house is considerably larger than in the 1975 adaptation and larger than the 1987 adaptation, and therefore, it becomes more believable that Mary could have mistaken Collin's crying for the wind, rather than know outrightly that it was someone crying.
1594202249|1.0|This book must have been written by a cute undergraduate student working under Pynchon's wing. The stoner jokes are not funny. The zeitgeist of the sixties is clearly contrived. This is an attempt to find the groove that Tom Wolfe, Tom Robbins and to a lesser extent Vonnegut so adeptly mined. Pychon's attempt however is a miserable failure. If this MS had been submitted by an unpublished writer it would have been universally rejected. I left my copy in hotel room trash can. Really pathetic.   P.S. I have read V, Gravity's Rainbow, The Crying of Lot 49 which are all vastly superior works.
B002NXSRVG|3.0|I am a fan of this director-Stephen Sommers....\\"Mummy\\", \\"Mummy Returns\\", \\"Van Helsing\\".

I enjoyed all the eye candy and the action scenes.<br /><br />the story has something to do with good guys protecting an ultimate weapon from the bad guys; the usual chaos follows.<br /><br />this movie is a nice way to warm up your cold winter days with heavy action.<br /><br />recommended mood to be in when you are about to watch this movie:  lethargic.

B000ZELISO|4.0|Mainly I just wanted to point out that I too loved all the books and have seen all the films, many times.     What I'd like to point out to all the detractors out there about book to film adaptations, is that you really need to quit complaining that films don't match up to the books, ANY BOOK.     There is no way anybook can be made into a film word for word or plot point to plot point. Movies would be over six hours long. You need to appreciate films for themselves. You will always find something wrong with any film if you look for it.     The fact is you need to be able to sit back relax and let the \\"film\\" not the \\"book\\" entertain you. Also most films based in metaphysics or science fiction need you to leave logic and embrace the the notion of suspending belief at the door. So please just take the time to enjoy the films you watch for what they are 90 to 150 mins of escapism, a place to leave the worries and stresses of everyday life and relax to a good story.
B002XUL85G|5.0|I had very high expectations (something I usually try to avoid because you end up disappointed 90% of the time) for this movie and I wasn't disappointed at all! I think that it's awesome! I've seen over 1000 horror movies and Paranormal Activity is definitely one of the best I've seen (top 50)! It's not one of the best I've seen only because it's one of the scariest, it's also one of the most realistic! The mix of realism, suspense and tension is just perfect!     A lot of people say that it's boring and I really don't get it. It's WAY too suspenseful to be boring. I've been trying to understand why the people that thought that it was boring went to see it since it was released. Why does someone who get bored easily go see a movie about a couple filming in their house? Why does someone who hated The Blair Witch Movie go see a similar movie? While we're at it, why does someone expect to be scared in a theater full of people? The fact that there are idiotic teens that can't stop talking and laughing 90% of the time doesn't help. Personally, I can't imagine finding a movie scary with 30 persons around me. I thought that the movie was scary (compared to most movies), but I watched it alone in the dark with an headset. The fact that I believe (or want to) in ghosts/demons helped as well. Actually, I can't imagine someone who doesn't believe in ghosts/demons finding a movie about them scary. What makes ghost/demons movies scary is the fact that there's no proof that they don't exist.    Anyway, the first few minutes of the movie was the only time that I didn't feel uneasy! The atmosphere was simply creepy! Hell, even a few parts with nothing but the couple talking were creepy! I guess that it was the expectation that something really bad was going to happen. The movie doesn't rely on cheap jump scares and/or scary images and doesn't have any over-the-top scare, it's all about tension and suspense.     It's not for people who need action every 5 minute and over-the-top scares. It's not for people who take trailers seriously and go see movies with unrealistically high expectations. It's not for people who watch movies with a closed minded and try NOT to get scared.     Finally, if it wasn't hyped, it would be much more appreciated. Some people just HAVE to hate hyped movies. Some others are so naive that they believe the hype.     PS: All of the people who call the people who like this movie idiots or sheeps are immature idiots. Just because you think that a movie is bad doesn't mean that those who think that it's good are sheeps or stupid or whatever dumb *beep* bigots love to come up with.
0340935278|4.0|I had not read any other of Piccoult's works, so came to this book with no preconcieved expectations.  It is told in a flashback style -- flipping from one time period to another.  This is not a technique that I generally enjoy, but it is well done here, and not confusing.    The book help my interest well, although it addresses a difficult topic: many \\"popular\\" students bullying another student over several years.  The bullying here is extreme -- to the point of \\"pantsing\\" the victim in a high school cafeteria, and forwarding the victim's a private love letter to everyone at his school).  The book tells the story from several points of view -- including several adults and teens.  I recommend the book.

B00164EAC8|5.0|I actually really like this film, but there are two glaringly bad things about it.   One, it shouldn't be called Godzilla... it's got nothing to do with the Japanese monster so why steal the name? Godzilla fans won't like it, and people who don't like Godzilla movies won't see it.   Two, while I really like Matthew Broderick... he was the wrong guy for this. It should have gone to someone like Jeff Goldblum or such.  And I guess I must point out that while CGI bits in movies tend to look like they're a higher resolution, in Godzilla... they look lower. I actually noticed how much sharper the picture went every time Godzilla went off screen.

1594488878|4.0|I loved High Fidelity, so in a minor fit of extravagance, I bought Juliet in hard cover because it isn't out in paperback yet. Hard cover lasts longer passed around among friends, and I certainly want to pass this one around. As a lesbian trapped in a redneck ex-jock's body, I just can't resist a good romantic comedy, and Hornby is an insightful investigator of the unending permutations of one heart's attraction to another.<br /><br />A common motif in Hornby's writing is the influence of and obsession with music. In this case, we have a man obsessed with a reclusive rock star who hasn't recorded in twenty years, the fixated but formal stalker's long suffering girlfriend, and a bitter, retired musician with too many ex-wives, children he doesn't know, no money and a creative well run dry.<br /><br />I read the 406 pages in two days. I just don't do that. Not since Lonesome Dove, anyway. Hornby manages to explore the role of artifice in art, the question of whether obsession can be benign, and the possibility of romance anchored in the messy real world, all while making me laugh out loud nearly every other page.<br /><br />Buy it now. Hornby deserves to be rich for helping renew my faith in fiction. If this isn't in production as the third Hornby screenplay adaptation (About a Boy, High Fidelity) then it will be soon.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|chris pine and karl urban made the movie. they have amazing chemistry. John cho and zachary quinto were amazing also. Great plot and the casting of WINONA RYDER as amanda was a coup.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I received my Susan Boyle CD from Amazon the day before Thanksgiving and have been playing it ever since. Each time, I hear something new to love. Her voice is so pure and lilting. I'm an early Baby Boomer and have bought few albums since the days of vinyl. It is great to have music back in the house... music you can sit back and enjoy or it can be a pleasant background to your daily routines. I had forgotten how much I enjoyed this. There is a hunger out there for music like this. Thank you Susan Boyle.
0316067598|5.0|Excellent book. This book offers an inside look into the training of Navy Seals and the sacrifices they have made in serving our country. As a high school football coach the emphasis of team was unbelivable. There willingness to sacrifice and give to each other is something we all can learn.

B0026P3G12|5.0|Have been looking forward to this album for some time now. I do love it, but think there was a lack of power in some of the songs. We all got used to the very powerful YouTube video of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" and this version seems somewhat toned down which was a bit disappointing (didn't give me goosebumps like the video did). However, I can't stop listening to it and even my 7 year old son has been keen to hear the album, which he actually likes very much! I think that Susan's voice has got a lot more power to soar than what comes across in the album. Hopefully the next album will also be a bit more upbeat.
0786715103|5.0|A lot has already been said about this book, thus my review will be brief. Dallaire, who was at ground zero for the worst genocide since 1945 and one of the worst in human history, was a man deeply impacted by what he experienced and what he was not allowed to prevent. That impact is evident in his memoir. It is a gripping account that will make the reader sad, angry, and frustrated: a genocide that need not have happened had the world decided to give a s--t. SHAKE HANDS WITH THE DEVIL is a work I would strongly recommend, for soldiers, students of international relations, foreign service folks, and anyone who cares about humanity. Kudos to Gen. Dallaire.
B0026NWBY2|5.0|I purchased this CD as a gift for my Beatles fan husband, who mentioned that \\"it might be a good one.\\" He's never been more thrilled with anything I've given him. Just this morning, weeks after he received it, he was humming, \\"When We Was Fab.\\" I haven't had a chance to listen to it yet, but apparently, it's all he listens to. And it beats what went before.
B002IR3PSC|5.0|Though it is very short lived concert on video, Ian makes good by apologizing to the viewers for the Broadcast time lap. From the credit fonts, it must have been an Independent small budget production channel that taped the show, and allowed only so much air time. Unlike   \\"the Midnight Special\\" show here on EST ( Broadcast from the west coast 90% of the time ... with commercials)Getting the footage as much as they did; brought back memories of seeing them at the Capitol Center in Largo,Md. ( Storm Watch & Bursting Out Concert's) and was just as memorable!I have been a big fan of Tull since 1976 and will always be one.
0061478784|5.0|Being the eldest of three daughters, Sophie has made up her mind that she will never amount to anything in life.  But when she is cursed by the Witch of the Waste Sophie is forced to set out to seek her fortune.  Along the way she meets the cowardly and womanizing Wizard Howl and is taken into his castle.  Sophie is tumbled headlong into a whiling adventure of magic and self discovery.<br /><br />I was inspired to read this book by my intense love of Hayao Miyazaki's animated adaption of Howl's Moving Castle.  After experiencing both I can honestly say that I enjoyed both despite their differences.  Both deviations of the plot boast magic, intrigue, originality and romance.  Sophie is a strong spirited heroine with issues in confidence that many girls can relate to.  Though Howl is a \\"slitherer-outer\\" as well as a womanizer his faults become endearing.<br /><br />Jones is a tolerably good writer though her novels are meant to be for young adult readers and as such are reasonably simple.  Still, she manages vivid descriptions and a compelling plot obviously born of a tremendously creative imagination.  Howl's Moving Castle is no typical fantasy novel about witches and wizards.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the movie or are simply looking for a good book I would definitely recommend Howl's Moving Castle!
B002MW50KO|1.0|Wow. This might be one of the worst things I've ever heard in my entire life. That said, I highly recommend this CD as a Christmas gift for anyone you don't like or for any friends with a sense of humor. Yes, Bob Dylan is an incredible songwriter, but he's always been a bad singer and it's only gotten worse. WAY worse. Songwriting abilities mean nothing when you're covering Christmas songs.
0099532530|3.0|I think even the most stallwart Murakami fan would have to be a little disappointed with this light book which focuses almost exclusively on his running habits.  As a piece for Runners World this might be fine but for a book it seems more an exercise in vanity than anything else.  The pages seems spliced together from notes Murakami made to himself over the years in regard to running.  Some of the chapters read better than others.  I liked his piece on the ultramarathon he ran along Lake Saroma in Hokkaido, Japan, where he stretched the limits of his endurance to the extreme, discovering new parts of himself.  But, other chapters like \\"Autumn in New York\\" were oddly bland, seeming to focus more on his insecurities in preparing himself for his fourth New York marathon.<br /><br />There is the occasional glimmer of sharp prose but for the most part this is a runner's journal, letting us know what running shoes he prefers, the music that spurs him on, how he battles with fatigue both in training and during the marathons, and a few of the thoughts that cross his mind while running, like finding the bouncing blonde pony tails of Harvard co-eds fun to focus on.  You discover passion for F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver, the occasional note on his own writing, his preference for 70s and 80s pop music like Bryan Adams, 18 Till I Die, while in training, and his thoughts on the ancient Greek marathon, which he ran in reverse from Athens to Marathon one scorching hot summer day for an article for a running magazine.  He tells us repeatedly he is not in this for the competition, but seemed to relish passing a hundred or more runners on the last leg of his ultramarathon in Hokkaido after finding his second wind.  He mentions his wife early on, who must not have been too happy about him giving up their jazz bar for his venture into writing and running, but hear no more about her until the end, as if to say his success merited his decision.  For Huraki, everything seemed to fall into place once he established this strong regiment of running, 36 miles per week, which he has kept up for 23 years.<br /><br />The book does draw to a pleasant close, mentioning some of the other personalities he meant during his marathons, like John Irving, noting his translation of Setting Free the Bears, and his ability to overcome his fears in swimming so that he was finally able to complete a triathlon.  His wife resurfaces in her supporting role.  Maybe they had some tacit agreement that he wouldn't mention her too much.  Lastly, he notes the adapted the title from a short-story collection by Raymond Carver, which his widow graciously permitted.nto place once he established this strong regiment of running, 36 miles per week, which he has kept up for 23 years.

B0015I2P0Y|4.0|I found this group and their music.  One of PBS World's promos features a piece of one of these songs from the CD. I decided to take a chance on the rest of the music; I have not been disappointed. I have found that some of the vocalizations is reminiscent of Sting, and recommend this CD to any who like this sort of music. Check it out.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I have played this CD over and over since I got it.  It is truly a masterpiece.  I have seen the live performance in Cleveland and this is a great memento.
B002XSP16A|5.0|Most of the songs on Susan's debut CD are difficult to sing. Nevertheless, she nailed each one, high notes, low notes and everything in-between. Way to go, Susan! I wish you all the success you deserve!
031606792X|1.0|The first three were not well written, but they were entertaining because the story was engaging and the characters had enough dimension to make them empathetic. The final book just progressively became more and more silly, it is impossible to suspend your disbelief because the story becomes ridiculous. The characters, especially Bella, became so different that they were unrecognizable.  I finished this book only to give myself a sense of closure, but it was just not a satisfying ending to the story even for someone who loves a happy ending. After reading these books, I will definitely be bypassing the author's future offerings.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|If you like Joe, you'll love this concert video.  Joe Bonamassa shows his awesome technique and phrasing with his lead playing, his voice is in fine form, and his stage presence is exactly what he gives at every performance, which is refreshing since this is THE Royal Albert Hall.  I also love Joe's humble approach to his craft and the honor of playing at such a prestigous venue.  Joe is joined onstage with Eric Clapton, and even Eric knows he's in the presence of something very special.  Buy it know, turn it up!
B00003CXIP|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite movies. Having seen it at least two dozen times over the years, it still hasn't gotten old. Adapted from the Stephen King novella \\"The Body\\" from the collection Different Seasons, the film follows four friends as they set out to find the dead body of a missing boy so they can become \\"heroes\\". Sensitive Gordie, tough but kindhearted Chris, troubled Teddy, and Vern, the proverbial fat kid, your sure to identify yourself with at least one of these characters. Watching this film, it's nearly impossible not to start thinking about you're own childhood friends and the adventures you had together. And it's true, you never will have friends again quite like the ones you had when you were twelve.
B002BU0DPE|3.0|I needed a pair of headphones with a microphone that allowed me to play the PS3 at night without disturbing others and also allowed me to chat in-game. This headset does that. It's very easy to set up and use, has a fantastic mic, and provides independent volumes for game sound and chat. Unfortunately, it sounds pretty terrible.<br /><br />As far as I know there is no product at this price point that does what the P21 does. You have to spend quite a bit more if you want something better (like the Astro A40s).<br /><br />The problem with this headset is the amplifier. It's garbage. It introduces all kinds of hiss and noise into the signal, and isn't capable of driving the headphones properly. My $10 pair of Sony earbuds sound better than this, never mind the Ultimate Ears SuperFi 5 Pro or Sennheiser HD600s I perfer using with the PS3.<br /><br />The P21s are definitely overpriced and they sound like absolute garbage, but they do what they are advertised to do. That's about it.
B002KREVE2|5.0|All of us who love LC already know of his lyrics and of his personal style marked by his humility.  He utilized his gifts to connect with and mesmerize 600,000 discontented and frustrated people.  I loved seeing this concert as it helpe me gain a broader perspective of what the Isle of Wight was about.  If you love LC then this is a must.
B00000DI2T|5.0|I never knew Mahler until I listened to Bernstein and I have listened to most of the others.
B002VECM6I|5.0|This movie is just incredible!  I went in with high expectations and they were exceeded....a rare feat indeed.  The story is both inspirational and funny; definately a movie for the entire family.  I was especially pleased that they kept the language relatively clean and the sexual content and violence to a minimum...a refreshing change!
0385504225|4.0|The Lost Symbol is a good follow-up to the Code.  While not his best work, it is enjoyable and fun to learn about aspects of this country's history and Washington DC.
0307266303|2.0|I started reading this book very excited because I had heard good things. The author's style turned me off faster than any other book I have read. The over-the-top description and metaphors only annoyed me.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|My friend gave me a (thankfully uncensored) copy of this album and I absolutely love it. The sound is differnt, a little darker and much my dance related. I haven't listened to ever song yet, but I have listened to Monster, Dance In The Dark, Bad Romance, and Telephone. I love the beat of Teeth, although the lyrics are very strange. I LOVE the video for Bad Romance. Can't wait for more.
0786868724|5.0|Mitch Albom has a distinct style, you either like it, or well you get the idea.  He writes very short paragraphs, almost like he is writing a column for his newspaper.  BUT, everything is tied together nicely.   This is a book that can do more to promote faith than many other religious books I have seen.  It is also a very engaging story on many other levels.  It is not quite as surreal as \\"Just One More Day\\", but it is equally touching.   I did not read \\"Tuesdays with Morie\\" - only saw the film.  I have, however, read the others and find this to be very very worthwhile.  The last chapter will make you laugh and cry.  And even though you know how the story is going to end, you will still enjoy getting there.
B001E2JNA6|5.0|As everyone knows this is the definitive version of P&P but the DVD quality was shockingly bad with washed out colors. When I heard this was available but only as a UK import (at that time it had not yet been released in the US) I ordered it immediately because I could not wait. I was blown away by the restoration. Many parts of the film are virtually perfect (on the top of the line 52 inch Sony LCD Bravia and OPPO Bluray player). Colors and detail are magnificent and really add to your enjoyment of this classic masterpiece. To be frank, I would have paid $100 for this. The whole thing is not perfect, you can see grain in places but it does not distract too much or take away from your enjoyment of the presentation. The only weird part is that scene at the end when they walk on the dirt path and it goes all washed out and blurry but that is not the fault of the Bluray but rather an artistic choice by the director to make it look dreamy and romantic. I would buy this all over again if they could find the original tape and fix that few seconds.<br /><br />Go buy this, it is one of the best productions of all time. Forget the latest pathetic Hollywood attempt to recapture this magic.
B0026P3G12|5.0|WOW is all I can say...when I saw her on T.V I thought she had a nice voice , but it was\\"nt until I brought her first album 3 hours ago then I realised  what the world had been waiting for, a singer with a haunting yet knowing voice.Susan sings with such ease and control that you would swear she's been singing and making albums for decades.Her control is flawless... and thats the kind of control (vocally)that takes most of the worlds great singers years to perfect.  Susans voice at times is so haunting and innocent and other times reaches the limits of someone with considerable knowledge and lifes experiences.  When I saw the song choices I thought (oh dear )its very brave for a beginner to even try and sing these songs (only try them in a karaoke  bar)!!!...BUT Susan sings them perfectly.....Only as a singer with 20-30 albums behind her and this is her greatest hit of all time album.......or so you would think.  Congradulations  Susan    ps. Thankyou for giving us a Star so bright

B000FFJ85I|5.0|This album was, in my opinion, the greatest album of its time. It will never be like the classic AFI we all know and love but it's still an AMAZING album with sex appeal. With beautiful, passionate vocals from lead singer Davey Havok, heart strumming riffs from guitarist Jade Puget, mellow, emotional sounds from bassist Hunter, and wonderful beats from drummer Adam Carson, this album earns 5 stars from me.<br /><br />The this album left me in tears with the beautiful ending ballad \\"Endlessly, She Said.\\" The songs conveyed a fusion of emotion with songs like \\"The Interview\\", \\"Summer Shudder\\", \\"Kiss and Control\\" and my personal favourite, \\"Love Like Winter.\\" Listening to this album, it never grew old. When I first listened to this album, I didn't want it to end. I wanted it to go on forever. The songs on this album do more then just portray music, they make you think. They make you feel the emotion. The album paints a beautiful mental picture with every changing song. This album is probably one of my favourite album of the 21st century. This album greatly inspired me to pursue my dream and start a band of my own. AFI continues to be my musical inspiration right down to the end. I highly recommend this album to anyone who enjoys romantic, emotional, yet hardcore lyrics and music.<br /><br />Prelude 12/21: When I first heard this song, it was in the Director's Cut version of the music video \\"Miss Murder\\". It left me curious and was a bit of a mystery and at the same time it was haunting. When I bought the album and heard it at the beginning, it sent chills up my spine. A wonderful opening. (9/10)<br /><br />Kill Caustic: Possibly one song I would LOVE to hear at an AFI concert. Which I have. It's completely fun to mosh to with it's punk rock \\"I don't give a crap about you\\" feel. Extremely fun to scream along to. The chanting at the end of the bridge when everyone yells \\"DON'T SPEAK MY NAME!\\" is truly fun. Especially at a concert when the whole building (or arena) shouts it simultaneously. (9/10)<br /><br />Miss Murder: When I first heard this, I was in shock. It had been a while since I heard AFI since Sing The Sorrow and hearing this catchy song got me moving. With the awesome bass intro that everyone loves followed by a little riff from Jade and Davey singing the chorus, this is probably the song that led me to buy the album. And the screaming bit Davey adds into the bridge is extremely fun. (9/10)<br /><br />Summer Shudder: The beginning to song is soft yet haunting. The lyrics are truly beautiful and poetic and really emits a wonderful emotion. (9/10)<br /><br />The Interview: I view this song as the prelude to Love Like Winter. (I don't know why though.) It's haunting, romantic, emotional, beautiful. The chorus is just amazing and the ending verse \\"Calm down, come down cold resides with me\\" sends chills up my spine with it's beautiful pipe organ. It's hauntingly beautiful. (10/10)<br /><br />Love Like Winter: Possibly my favourite song on the album. I love the foots steps in the beginning. It really gets me into the song. The music video to this was simply gorgeous. Davey's vocals are upbeat and the music is an awesome blend of rock and techno. An upbeat sound with haunting lyrics. (15/10)<br /><br />Affliction: Awesome song with AFI's old \\"punk rock\\" feel. Whereas it's not my favourite song on the album, I can honestly say that I choke up every time I hear the bridge \\"so stay sweetly numb. remain lifeless love\\". The hidden bonus track at the end is a great and haunting closure. (8/10)<br /><br />The Missing Frame: When I heard this song at first, I wasn't really into it. After a couple of listens it grew on me. Hearing it at the concert really made me excited whenever it played. I truly love the bridge \\"Will the flood behind me put out the fire inside me?\\". To me, it portrays the longing to put away the evilness that might have been festering up inside. It's also a beautiful counteract to the band's true name (A Fire Inside). (8/10)<br /><br />Kiss And Control: Okay, first off, this song is beautiful. Just downright beautiful. From the lyrics to the music to the screaming, it's beautiful. A close runner up favourite to Love Like Winter. I love the bridge wear Davey isn't singing, but SPEAKING. \\"We all wanna die like movie stars you said as you jumped from the height of our cutting room floor.\\" This song is truly a beautiful ballad and leaves me feeling emotional every time. (10/10)<br /><br />The Killing Lights: A song that's sort of brings back the glory days of their old sound of punk rock. With the neat little \\"oh!\\" at the beginning, this song is truly fun with a chilling ending. (8/10)<br /><br />37mm: I love the way this song twists. It starts out haunting and creepy with a bit of turn towards a more poppy sound with a little piano bit in the bridge. The ending is neat with \\"We're no one... We're no one...\\" repeating with the neat \\"oh\\" in the background. (9/10)<br /><br />Endlessly, She Said: Possibly the BEST ending song they've ever done. This ballad is beautiful and filled with much longing. I always end up blubbering at the end. It's a song that if you don't feel ANY emotion, you probably need your head examined. This just strums at your heartstrings and chilling ending just JERKS at them. My third favourite song on this album. (10/10)ust downright beautiful. From the lyrics to the music to the screaming, it's beautiful. A close runner up favourite to Love Like Winter.

B002LVUG3C|4.0|A very good special edition reissue, while I don't consider this album essential for Bowie fans, it is a historically important snapshot of David Bowie at the tail end of the 60s. The reality is, while Bowie kept at the singles market throughout the 60s, he was probably too out of sync with the sensibilities of the 60s to belong to that era. He began to find his voice with this album, but he would also have a ways to go before he truly arrived. First off, the title track is a truly great piece, not only a great song, but a great record as well. The team of Producer Gus Dudgeon, and arranger Paul Buckmaster delivered such an impeccable record, that Elton John and Taupin would soon snatch them up for John's series of classic albums. Rick Wakeman's eerie Mellotron blends almost perfectly with Buckmaster's arrangement. Producer Tony Visconti takes over for the rest of the proceedings, \\"Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed\\" evolves into a good up-tempo rocker, with some hot harmonica soloing and an horn ensemble. The fun little filler known as \\"Don't Sit Down\\" is tagged on the end of \\"Unwashed\\" as all one track, and this differs from the Ryko reissue from the early 90s.    \\"Letter To Hermione\\" is a plaintive ballad about the breakup of his girlfriend. \\"The Cygnet Committee\\" is one of the more interesting tracks, as it's theme would be explored again with \\"Savoir Machine\\" off of the next album TMWSTW, as well as some thematic aspects of Ziggy Stardust,  A messianic figure exploiting his followers, while his followers exploit him in kind. The song also seems to also be a scathing lament of the fallen ideals of utopian hippies, i.e. the outcome of Altamont, the career opportunism of Woodstock, etc... The electric Harpsichord work of Rick Wakemen is outstanding on this track and tends to get overlooked. \\"Janine\\" is probably the most accessible track, and for my tastes, the least interesting, and the track I tend to feel seems like filler. While not essential, I like \\"An Occasional Dream\\", while it seems a little dated, the Flute and recorder ensemble works well, and harkens to Bowie's Anthony Newley influence. The Newley influence creeps through on \\"The Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud\\", I initially assumed that Paul Buckmaster was involved in the arrangement, being that it was the B side to \\"Space Oddity\\", and Buckmaster could be heard on Bowie's Demo, but to my surprise Tony Visconti was responsible for this epic, over the top orchestral arrangement.    \\"God Knows I'm Good\\" is a narrative about a shoplifting incident that manages to comment on rationalist thinking. \\"Memory of a Free Festival\\" is an odd closer, with Bowie's plaintive vocal and pump organ, that again seems to be a sympathetic lament on the idealism of the late 60s. The closing \\"Sun Machine\\" segment seems to reference \\"Hey Jude\\", as there's a horn ensemble buried in the mix to reinforce that impression. While there's a certain degree of studio polish on the album, there's also a kind of looseness present we would never see again from Bowie.     Peter Mew's work on the digital remaster is outstanding, with some added presence, and clarity when needed. The second disc is generous with it's selections, while a number of these tracks appeared on the Ryko issues, or the Sound and Vision box set. These versions of \\"Space Oddity\\" and \\"Occasional Dream\\" are demos featuring his brief partnership with John Hutchinson, This version of \\"Freecloud\\" had already been heard on the 'Sound and Vision' collection. \\"Let Me Sleep Beside You, Unwashed\\", and \\"Janine\\" are recordings from the BBC Radio D.T.L show, and rather good. Two mixes of \\"London, Bye, Ta, Ta\\" are included, although the track had already appeared on the 'Sound and Vision' set. A Stereo mix of  1970's \\"The Prettiest Star\\" with Marc Bolan is included.     A Stereo mix of \\"Conversation Piece\\" is featured, whereas the Ryko addition featured a Mono mix, this track is interesting from the standpoint of showing a confessional self reflective side to Bowie's writing that normally isn't seen. The electric re-take of \\"Memory of a Free Festival\\" is included, featuring the first time Mick Ronson appears, as well as a layer of moog synths, this was the other bonus featured on the Ryko 1990s issue, this version of \\"Memory\\" hints at the hard rock glam direction Bowie would soon take. A longer version of \\"Memory\\", from the original album, with a longer fade out is also included. Also included is an alternative mix of \\"Freecloud\\" where the vocal is brought more forward, and the orchestration less emphasized. The Italian mix of \\"Space Oddity (Ragazzo Solo, Ragazza Sola)\\", features an interesting mix of the backing tracks for Gus Dudgeon's production and brings this collection full circle.    The packaging, while missing lyrics, includes a great set of liner notes from Kevin Cann, as well as a timeline of Bowie's career during this period. As well as unreleased photos, sketches, and art work. The packaging certainly offers value for your dollar, but seems geared towards completists, or the very curious. Hopefully this will lead the way towards generous reissues of \\"The Man Who Sold The World\\" and \\"Hunky Dory\\". Recommended.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|This show has to be my absolute FAVORITE on TV!!!! The cast and the writing is just superb - all of the characters have wonderful timing and chemistry and the show is just so much fun to watch!!! Every episode makes me smile and I look forward to watching the next one - I highly recommend this show - but buyer beware - you will get HOOKED and never go back! :-) Enjoy!
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I really love Michael Buble's music. He is so creative in this CD especially.  There is jazz, very upbeat easy listening music, and tons of enjoyable music.  All I want to say is WOW- what a fantastic and enjoyable CD.
1845767055|5.0|I have quite a few art books, spanning a broad range of subjects and this is up there with the best. Paul Bonner's quirky characters and amazing landscapes really come to life, and as an art school graduate I can really appreciate his command over his chosen media. I didn't really get much out of the dinosaur section at the back, but I certainly can't deny his skill in painting them, and it is easy to see how his love of the extinct lizards has filtered down through many of his monster creations. I constantly find new and interesting little details hidden throughout his paintings (not sure if it's just me, but I seem to find faces hidden all throughout his work, blending into tree bark, rocks, clouds etc. Maybe it's just my imagination...). If you have an interest in fantasy art in general, especially the more classical heroic style, and have ever been into RPG's or wargames, this book is a definite must.

B000002J09|5.0|I just discovered Led Zeppelin recently when I read Dave Grohl's article on Rolling Stone about his greatest influence, the biggest rock band of the 70s, Led Zeppelin. It was from reading his article that I decided to take a listen on this album famously know as the Four Symbols album. I must admit that I'm not a big Led Zeppelin at all, but after listening to this I might as well have been one. From the first two songs Black Dog and Rock and Roll, which is by far two of the most rocking classic songs I've ever heard, to the mysterious Battle Of Evermore, which sounds very much like a Lord of the Rings tribute (think Hobbit and you are there), to a song that needs no introduction: Stairway to Heaven which is a miracle of songwriting and rifts and rhythms and melodies, to Misty Mountain Hop which is just as rocking as the first two, with the overlying rift getting to you, Zeppelin IV never ceases to amaze and entertain.       If there is a perfect example of Led Zeppelin's versatility this is it. You wanted Folk? Battle of Evermore. Country? Going to California. A good rock song? You got so many to choose from here, including Four Sticks which is classic Zeppelin with its rifts and flowing rhythm. You want the all-important hit to play all day long? Stairway to Heaven is a no-brainer. You want lyrics, you want good singles, you got it all in this album, making it probably the tightest Rock I've ever listened to. Only One Hot Minute by the Red Hot Chili Peppers stands close, for me.     If you ever wondered what the best Rock album sounds like, this is it.

B000001EXR|4.0|KISS did the unexpected in 1995, they made a modern sounding heavy rock album. The problem was the band was in a state of turmoil and they were about to embark on their record setting reunion tour with Ace Frehley and Peter Criss so `Carnival of Souls' was shelved for two years. When the LP finally got a release the band that recorded it did not exist. That was unfortunate because `Carnival' was probably the last piece of relevant music that the band would ever do. Kulick and Singer were arguably more talented and creative than Criss and Ace could ever be but the box office did not care; the public wanted the original KISS and that's what Paul and Gene gave them.  KISS long ago gave up the ghost of being relevant in the music marketplace as their constant touring and playing of music from their Seventies heyday would attest. `Carnival' was a brave attempt to show that KISS could be musical chameleon and mimic the Seattle bands at their own game with Alice In Chains and Soundgarden being the most obvious influences on the record. \\"Jungle\\" was the grunge epic from the LP and was a darker and more sophisticated song than any in KISS' rather large catalog.  \\"Hate\\", \\"Rain\\" and \\"Master and Slave\\" lead off the album and prove to be a challenge to the ardent KISS fan who never expected this type of joyous sound from a band who always......oh man I hate this phrase...\\"rock n' roll all nite and party every day\\".  \\"Childhood's End\\" and \\"I Walk Alone\\" (which features the lead vocals of Bruce Kulick, his only KISS vocal) are two other notables. I would caution any casual KISS fan that this album may not be for you for many of the reasons I have stressed previously but the patient listener may be rewarded. I would never consider `Carnival of Souls' a favorite but it was a worthwhile attempt at the modernization of a band that too many times had been shall we say complacent??

B002H3EUA4|2.0|I Love This Movie! It's one of my favorite holiday movies of all time! And I was dissapointed to see that the regular edition DVD didn't have any deleted scenes or anything. But when I discovered that this was releasing I thought it would have all of that plus more! MAN! was a fooled! Believe me! This new special edition DVD makes a deceptive use of the words \\"Deluxe\\" and \\"Anniversary\\". Take any other movie that uses thoses words and you usually have some new surprises like deleted scenes, bloopers, behind the scenes, and etc... But not this DVD!!!! They didn't even try! This DVD may look great but it's still the same as the original DVD. Only diiference is you get a big metal box with the DVD, an ornament, coasters, a little bag of fake snow, and a little hat with Marty Moose on it! Well! Woop De Do! I can go just fine with out that stuff any day! I want extra features that are actually part of the DVD!!! So, take my advise and don't by this new DVD! You're better off buying the original DVD!!!!! Believe me! And as for my rating not because this is a bad movie! I love this movie!!! But I don't like how they made this lasy version of a Christmas Classic!!!

B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle this is a first rate album.  Her diction is so good.  Even in professional singers you rarely are able to hear the constants in their speech. My Church Choir Director would be proud.  She has a gift of singing clearly with an emotional depth not present in many productions today.  This debut album features a gifted artist with a gifted production.  Good Luck Susan, I'm giving your album out for Christmas this year. I hope to hear from her soon in a TV special or another album.
0792843584|4.0|I only saw this film once a quarter of a century ago, yet it's impact has never left me and I can still remember even now my reactions to it.I was mesmerised by the breadth and the sheer beauty of so much of the photography. I was astounded that an American studio could produce such a European film with it's slow pace and its unfocused plot. The lack of any strong characters felt like a flaw but I raged at the completely unnecessary ending on the yacht which seemed as though it was bolted on to give some kind of plot cohesion and which was entirely at odds with the style of the rest of the picture.It was also refreshing to see a western which made no pretence about the brutality and exploitation that so often was the unfortunate detritus of the American Dream.The western scenes and sets also had an authenticity which was entirely new to me and which prefigured the recent Deadwood series.The film was massively cut for the American audience and its my very real wish that in these days of Director's Cuts that Michael Cimino is given the opportunity of a fresh edit in the light of reflection - a cut which could turn this ill fated movie into the masterpiece it had the potential to become
1589944607|5.0|Fantasy Flight Games's Battlestar Galactica is the board game representation of the cult hit television series. And when I say, \\"representation\\", I mean it. This game is the perfect marriage of theme with board game. Those who are aspiring board game designer who need inspiration for who to make their games more thematic: look no further than BSG.    Battlestar Galactica was designed by some of the usual suspects at FFG: Corey Konieczka, Eric M. Lang, Jeff Tidball and Mark O'Connor. The game accomodates between three to five players and takes about 2 to 3.5 hours to play.     The goal of BSG is different depending upon which side you are on: human or cylon. The humans must make one faster-than-light (FTL) jump after they have travelled 8 parsecs; the cylons must prevent this from happening by either destroying the Galactica or eroding the Galactica's resources.     At game set-up, players secretly receive a loyalty card.     There are two types of loyalty cards: human and cylon. These cards remain secret throughout the game. Players may never willingly reveal secret information. After the Galactica has jumped a sum of 4 or more parsecs, a second (and last) set of loyalty cards are dealt out. If you have a cylon card, you are a cylon. Thus, players who start the game as humans could quite likely end the game as a cylon!    The humans need to negotiate crises after each turn. Failure to negotiate a crisis usually costs the Galactica some resources. Should a resource fall to 0, the game is over and all cylons are winners.     The resource dial is turned to show the new value when a crisis is failed.     In order to negotiate a crisis, all players will secretly skill play cards from their hands. All crisis cards and all skill cards are color coded. If the skill cards match the crisis' color, the skill card aids in the negotiation of that crisis; if the color, however, does not match, the skill card makes the crisis that much more difficult.     Two random cards are also added to the crisis resolution so that no one knows for sure if the crisis was sabotaged by the cylons!    Players assume the role of one of the main characters on board the Galactica.    Each character has a skill set appropriate to their character. This is the amount of skill cards they will draw during their turns. The characters also have some special abilities and a special weakness that really rounds out who the character is.    Players will move around the board during their turns in order to obtain more skill cards or to \\"put out fires\\". Parts of Galactica may have been damaged which requires a player to repair. Cylon raiders or basestars may be in the vicinity requiring the Galactica to make a military response.     Colonial One gives the President some quorum cards which are quite powerful.    The game continues until the Galactica has made jumped after reaching the 8 parsec marker, when the Galactica is destroyed or when any resource reachs zero.     Battlestar Galactica is a gamer's game. It's rich in theme. The game is one of bluffing, intuitition and some deduction. There are ample opportunities for resource management. This is a competitive AND cooperative game. The game is enjoyable to those who are not familiar with the television--although if you like the show, you will almost certainly love this game!     The quality of the components is high. The box is high quality cardboard with linen. The bits are thick cardboard or durable plastic. The cards are high gloss with full color pictures on them. The only complaint I have with the nuts and bolts of the game is the storage compartments: there are none! You will have to find some creative way of storing your BSG game if you want your bits to be organized.     I recommend this game to anyone who likes RPG's and is reluctant to try board games. I recommend it to anyone who likes the TV show and likes board games in general. Also, if you like mind games, BSG is a game you ought to try!

B0000844M8|5.0|After so many reviews by the distinguished people here, very little is left unspoken, if there is at all any.<br />First of all, for any movie goer, this is a MUST. This is a sweet movie of a wonderful true story, performed superbly by the actors and even by the animals (whom you won't like to think as animals after the movie finishes).<br /><br />Apart from technicalities (vivid imagery of Kenya), acting and top class music, what I liked most of the movie is the simple, lyrical way it tells us the eternal story of life cycle. Not only of lions or animals, but human being as well, may be of all living beings.<br />Passion and care in grooming Elsa and her siblings were no different than grooming one's own children (the couple had no children), while the way Elsa has been trained to acclimatized to the world including swimming only reminds us about growing kids. The ultimate test of parenthood for the couple came to teach and facilitate Elsa to have a partner in the wild, which brought in as much excitement, joy, suspense and concern as parents feel when their daughter gets married. The wonder of the movie is, through this cycle of the lions, we remember the eternal cycle of life of human being as well. Starting with Elsa's cubhood to her motherhood, thereby triggering another set of cubhood - the film charms us with this ageless story of life cycle. A sweet, brilliant and memorable movie.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I would place this film amongst the most powerful I have ever seen in a long life of cinema going.The script was brilliantly tight and barely a word was wasted. The sets were very authentic and cost I heard a reported £30 million. Beyond the walls of Wilberforce's home the world of London was presented in a dark and brooding manner which reinforced the sense of the legitimised evil that Wilberforce and his associates were fighting.<br />The mainly ensemble British acting was of the highest order. Outstanding performances amongst others were given by Ioan Gruffudd who superbly conveyed the complexities of Wilberforce's character, Michael Gambon,Rufus Sewell,Benjamin Cumberbatch, and Romola Garai with a superb cameo of the reformed and redeemed slaver, John Newton, by Albert Finney.Balance was given by recognition of the important role of Oloudaqh Equiano played by Youssou N'Dorr.However, some historical license was taken in order to create dramatic effect.This included the Duke of Clarence sitting in the House of Commons and James Fox,one of the greatest orators and reformers of the day, giving the final paean of praise to Wilberforce when in history he had already died.<br />Never mix politics and religion we are told, yet the film does it successfully by embellishing the issue with a real wit and humour.The power of the film lies to a great extent in its understatement which makes it very British and it will be interesting to see how well it does in the States.The deliberately diverted visit of MP's and their consorts to the moored slave ship was a metaphor of this. The power of the misery was conveyed without it being completely thrust in the face. The final tribute to Wilberforce was another notable example of the power of the use of a few chosen words rather than many.<br />The film was both moving and inspirational. In this era of the quick fix, it reminded us, as do the lives of Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu,of the importance of never giving up in the fight for a more just and humane world. Evil prospers when good men and women do nothing -but we need to do it again and again and again. There are more slaves in the world today than there were at the time of abolition and I trust this film will inspire another generation to continue the struggle.For those who want a more politically correct revisionist view of history and who cry paternalism, it needs to be emphasised that Wilberforce and his supporters took on the might of the political and economic establishment of the day and won. Yes he was a compassionate man but he was also a great champion of justice and justice above all requires that we see those who we are trying to help as equals.This is an outstanding piece of film making that does justice to the achievement of Wilberforce and his associatesjust and humane world.

1434475662|3.0|This book is cheap, and after reading it I noticed why, there are quite a number of spelling errors. It doesn't really detract from the quality of the story, but it is a bit annoying. I guess beggars can't be choosers.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|Best TV show they have come up with in a long time. Take your time and watch and listen and it will suck you into a wonderful story.
1401323820|4.0|Although this is a book about a fictional character drawn from another fictional character and is written by a fictional writer who is not only writing a book based on his fictional adventures but is obviously using the opportunity to live out a few of his fictional fantasies, *gasp for breath* - it all, believe it or not, works.     The book is a fun read on the surface, just as a detective story.  A little cute, but that's because it is based on the show \\"Castle,\\" which has fun characters -- all of whom appear in the novel under barely-assumed names.  And since it is purportedly written by Rick Castle himself, who obviously has the hots for Detective Kate Beckett in the series, Castle allows his book alter-ego \\"Jameson Rook\\" to get snuggly with Detective Beckett's alter-ego \\"Nikki Heat\\" even though the show itself makes clear that she is not going to let that happen anytime soon, if at all.  I keep imagining Beckett's furious reaction upon reading the book, which of course is all part of the fun.  If you are just looking for a mystery novel, this one's okay; but if you are a fan of the show this is a great big grin on many levels.  My hat is off to whoever the talent ghost is who made this all work.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Like many others I fell in love with Susan Boyle's voice when I first heard her sing \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\". I was one of the first to order the new CD which arrived today. It is a joy to listen to. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to hear a beautiful voice instead of the screaming bug-a-boo that so many seem to think is music. I can hardly wait for a second album.
031606792X|4.0|I disagree with the negative reviews except for the name.  I hated the name Renesmee but, really, it's just a trivial detail.   Perhaps I read the book through different eyes than the younger readers.  I enjoyed this series as pure entertainment, an escape from daily life, and was never disappointed.   I do have one complaint: I would LOVE to see more, a continuation of the developing rivalry with the Volturi, and to continue with the lives of Bella/Edward and Nessie/Jacob.  It ended as if to give way to a whole new series...
B0000CDJPQ|5.0|Sonnet FireWire 400 to 800 Adapter (FAD-824) Couldn't find this item anywhere!  I needed this to connect my i sight camera to my new mac computer.   Apple didn't carry this item neither did any of the big electronic stores.  It worked out perfectly Thank You! Amazon.
B001AVCFJM|3.0|I always complained that after the original series was over that star trek became too touchy/feely. The characters too politically  correct and goofy to be taken seriously. Most of the plots bland and lifeless, ect. The original series managed to have both   intelligent stories and action/adventure, so why couldn`t the later series and films?  So I really wanted to like this new film, but they didn`t make that easy. After watching this chinese fire drill in outerspace,...  well maybe TNG, DS9, ect. were not \\"that\\" bad after all. If nothing else, at least they had a little dignity. This film has plenty  of action, but completely pointless as there is next to no plot (let alone an intelligent story) for it to fit into. Maybe they could  have done with one or two less special effects and used the money to hire a writer. The story is pretty much hokum and all the   special effects in the world can`t mask that.  You would think that a modern big budget movie could at the very least equal a low budget 60s tv show, but it seems they can`t.  Hollyweird strikes again.
0307266303|5.0|After many years of \\"running\\",reading this book has confirmed to me what I felt all along but did not know was possible.  It showed me how a new beginning in my running can be made.  I tried it and it is amazing what the results are.      In an excellently told tale, Christopher writes about a trail run.  But not just an actual trail run, but also the trail run of life.  It is a very well written book; I read it in about 2 days.  This will be the first book which I will reread, so that I can experience it again.    Regards,  Rik
B0026P3G12|3.0|Susan Boyle was wonderful in her audition and her album is much anticipated. But does it live up to the expectations?    Not quite, unfortunately.    I wish they, on a full length album like this, would have included the title track in its entirety, instead of the abdridged version of her TV audition.     Susan's voice is great for ballads but the album would have benefited from an occasional change of pace - it gets, to be honest, a bit boring after a while. A more imaginative production would have helped too - the songs sound too much alike (although \\"Who I Was Born to Be\\" builds up slowly to a nice climax; I wish they would have done the same on the title song).     Susan Boyle is a great singer, and her debut album is not bad, but also not great. I wish it had been. She would have deserved it.
B002X20W2E|5.0|This is her best album yet in my opinion.  I can actually listen to all the songs without hitting the skip button.  I loved it!  I read one review that complained about the bad language, and I must disagree.  There is really very little cursing on the album.  I'm also super happy that I got the entire album for 99cents.  Amazon is the BEST!
B0017HMF6W|4.0|I'll be very brief because if you're buying the movie on Blu Ray you probably   have seen this mutiple times. The bottom line is, if you like the movie you  will be vey happy with the Blu Ray. The PQ quality is excellent, no grain.  Sharpness could be a little better but still good. Add this one to your collection.

Unfortunately, the second layer of my Artisan Ultimate Edition DVD is defective - all audio/video is erratic and pixelated after the layer switch at 1:22:18, all the way to the end. Please note that Amazon has compensated me for this defective DVD. I would recommend to any si-fi enthusiast. Good acting, direction and cinematography, excellent big production quality (the special effects still hold up well), and the story line is entertaining.

If you like blues, check this one out.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|In a nutshell this product was great!  Not only was the Acadamy Award winning movie filled with breathtaking action scenes and increcible acting, but the story was like nothing I've ever seen.

Absolutely Amazing!<br /><br />The dvds and the case looked like I had just purchased them from the store, and worked just as well.  I'm very happy with what I bought and look forward to buying more from amazon!

0393327655|5.0|With arguably no topic in America more contentious and hotly debated than religion (oddly enough), it is important to ponder the rationality of stated and unstated religious wars (or just one-on-one killings for the same purposes).  In absence of a compulsory high-school course on \\"comparative world religion and philosophy,\\" this book, as a minimum, provides a few interesting observations.  Overall, an entertaining read, sure to fuel endless passionate debates (in which I have absolutely no intention to partake).
B000050HTO|5.0|This is quite a good mix of Dylan tunes. It makes a great compilation for a new Dylan fan or anyone wanting a taste of all his music through the years. There are songs I would have added, but that is personal taste. Great CD's!
0141439475|5.0|Thanks to a string of Hollywood's idiotic executives focused on cheap thrills, decades of bonehead movies have used Frankenstein in their title, but have kept nothing of the original story.  As a result, readers that grab this title seeking a horror story (gory or not) stand to be disappointed.  Mary Shelley's story, which must be read in full appreciation of the style and sensibilities of the 19th century, is actually the sad story of a creature rejected by its creator.  Love and love denied, revenge and forgiveness, rejection and acceptance, right and wrong - and how human judgment is tainted by appearances.  In a century where image is all and beauty is mistaken for intelligence, Frankenstein's story is all too contemporary.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This is one real of an eye opener! It is one great shame to think the vast majority of ourselves don't want to question to where our food has resided. There is too much out there to let it all slip away like dust in the wind.    You go walk in a supper market and you think theirs alots of variety, but there's isn't. One comporation or maybe two or three maybe, hold, contol, over all the food. Theres too much food in there, u ask. That's just isn't right. We garner a lots of pomatos in the poultry isle, but are they tomats? No I tell, no! They are une nice idea of a tomatu, but they sure ain't a tomat! No seasons in grocery stores either, have you ever payed notice? Such makes us question our existence on this planet - plenty of people but they are proper people or a nice idea of a people? Publix garantees majestical isles as far as my eyes can see - BUT - it is all a vale to hide real shame. Do not you ever wonder where the source is what you food resides the source?    chickens, antibiotocs, corn, e.coli (aka 157H7), maltodextrin, the BUSH ADMINISTRATION...Wow! We come from 1950 when it took a year to harvest a chicken, but now Mike Tyson made it so that you can get a 50 pound chicken in less than a week. With big wite breasts (I likem but 'taint right). Is not that just a little unsettled? Theese chickens are starving w/ diseases and since they are so big they can not even hold there own wait to strole down to the pub for a bight. And then Kevin ate 3 ham bugars (intresting that it is called a HAM burgar, no?) that contained infected corn from infected cows and he was dead in 12 days! But that 12 days did not go without its unbenefits, he had a condition where he could only afford water from a small sponge for he begged for water and he ate upon that very sponge.    Our govt has been making handshakes with this corporations now. The USDNA & FDA turn one other blind eye to this scam of hurting us. We waste land for our greed. Corn. Animals = money = no humanity. Did you realize that workers were once african american, but are now undocumented workers? These crooked swines (swine flu? NO COINCIDENCE) loves this worker because he/she can be replaced with much of ease. They brought the factory to the back of a mcdonalds kitchen. And it ain't right.    Every American should do it there duty to watch this film. You should no where the food that you thrust into your gums is residing. Please boycott Food Inc. This is a twobit organisation. It poisons our earth. I glad I live in Canada.

B002K0WBXW|2.0|I love Sandra Bullock, but this was not one of her best roles. I don't like seeing her as the 'witch' that she portrayed. But mainly 2 stars b/c the writers didn't dwell long enough on WHY she did the 'turn around' personality. I thought this was quite dull but I truly enjoy whatever Betty White is in. She is great. Ryan Reynolds is a cutie, very sweet in this one but again, not enough story line on the transition of the hate to love scenario. They could have cut a lot of boring out and written the middle better.

B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle's first album is, like her, a gem. I shudder to think that if she had never tried out for BGT,the public may have missed this angelic inspirational voice. Her singing talent is huge, and the purity of her voice is spine-tingling.  Certainly her voice conveys the emotion of lyrics so powerfully that eyes get teary and you have to listen over and over to this album.  I look forward to more CDs by this angel in whatever genre she picks. Thank you Susan for the gift of your singing.
B002MW50KO|4.0|I have never written a review of anything here, but I had to respond to one of the critics of this album, describing it as the \\"Worst Christmas album ever...\\", and, \\"Bob Dylan went into music because he couldn't make any money as a poet...\\" First of all, Dylan is a Pulitzer Prize winning musician and poet, and Dylan is donating his royalties from this album to the charity \\"Feeding America\\" in order to provide \\"food security to people in need.\\"  Aside from that, this is a sincere effort by Bob Dylan to sing in his now raspy voice, and it is an acquired taste. I must say I prefer it to the slick, perfectly produced christmas albums that pervade the airwaves at this time of year.  I find his work here to sound a bit like what Father Christmas might sound like!  God Bless ya Bob.
B001FB55HQ|5.0|many of the old fan hates this movie. I am young fan and like the war of future. terminator Sarah Connor chronicles made me a fan. There so much to take advantage of.  If have not watch the trailer this movie should more thrilling.  The moives does have it flaws like john Conner's wound at the end. Also it the main character Marcus really helps make the movie.
0385341008|4.0|This book was an unexpected delight. It was warm and life-affirming and wonderfully old-fashioned. It was a structural feat to make the story hang so well together considering the book consists ENTIRELY of letters - yet it didn't feel forced. The letters and story had added power given the speed and volume of so many of our empty, superficial communications today. Interesting too to have such a central character never appear or write a letter (since she was dead when the story began) - even if she did seem a bit too good to be true.
B002MW50KO|5.0|First off..Bob Dylan's a musical genius who can do pretty much anything, and it will be good.  Dylan's style and personality never stray. This is what makes \\"Christmas in the Heart\\" a great holiday CD.  Are you looking for a holiday pop cover album? Look elsewhere. This album is for those who appreciate Dylan's raspy renditions of Christmas oldies.
0061703257|3.0|This is the first book by Lehane that I read. I liked the preview for the movie Shutter Island. Realizing it was based on one of Lehane's novels and not wanting to wait till Febuary when the movie comes out I took it out from the library. First the book is very readable it has a nice flow and is not a difficult book to get through. The basic plot was great basically a mental patient escapes from a locked room in a mental instituatoin which happens to be on island. However the ending basically ruined what up until the ending was a great novel. Spoiler alert. I found the ending to be unoriginal and made me think this was written as for the Twilight Zone. The whole it was all a dream made up ending has been done before, that one season of Dallas comes to mind. The reader invests a lot of time in this mystery and character. Then we are told at the end that oh it was all basically a dream. Sure the ending wraps everything up but it does it in a lame way. It trys to be deep but fails. So this poor fool is doomed to repeat this routine over and over or he ends up having to get a lobotomy how does that help him. The noir aspects of this book were good but the ending while I can see why some people might think its good was just lazy.
1601251505|5.0|A little background first: I am a veteran DM, having played D&D since the days of the old 'Red Box' Basic rules in the early 1980s. For the past three years I have run a 3.5 ruleset campaign set in the Forgotten Realms.<br /><br />After some consideration I have decided not to switch over to 4e. It's just not my cup of tea. With that in mind Pathfinder is heaven-sent! I enjoy the options available, as well as the ability to make nearly any character I can conceive of using just the basic rules. The system is not perfect, just as 3.5 was not perfect. Power creep at higher levels is still a problem, but a good DM should be able to keep his or her players interested.<br /><br />Pathfinder has taken the basic 3.5 ruleset and streamlined it a bit. If you don't like D&D 3.5, you will not like Pathfinder. It's basically the same game with certain issues cleaned up or improved upon (the rules for grappling and spells like Polymorph come to mind). It is not a game for the faint of heart, however. There is a lot to digest here, and a lot to read through. But I find the end result very impressive. I also have the Pathfinder Bestiary: it too has a distinctive look, and it updates many of the classic monsters of yesteryear for use in any campaign. The Pathfinder campaign world (Golarion) is also excellent, especially if you are looking for a pre-published world in which to set your adventures.<br /><br />All in all, highly recommended, especially for veteran players and Dungeon Masters alike.
B001KL3GY0|3.0|Tonight:Franz Ferdinand being Franz Ferdinand's 2009 release and their 3rd studio album is a very ordinary album. The sound is basic rock and not indie rock as many would have you believe. The lyrics I have heard so many times before and the sound is generic rock music. Not that it is bad. It is just not that interesting. Allmusic, The Guardian and Uncut all gave it around 3.5 to 3 out of 5. I think 3.5 is a bit high. The booklet is quite basic and nice. It contains all the lyrics, many basic photographs but not a list of whom plays what. 3/5.
B0025KVLTM|3.0|So much has already been said that I write this merely to agree with the two reviewers who have given the album just one star. I think one star is a bit of an overstatement, but let's give it something like three stars, because after all, it is quite pleasant to listen to. Important or impressive in any way it isn't. Sure, as someone pointed out, every little thing on it was an innovation at the time, but innovation is not always great music: electronic sounds, too, are an innovation, but unless masterfully put together to say something, they're cousins of all the electronic blips your computer makes - hardly music you can't live without, methinks. Sgt. Pepper was so overhyped at the time that openly not liking it could get you physical injury from both hysterical girl fans and aesthetically offended boy fans - a situation nearly incomprehensible today, if nothing else because hysterical girls have been replaced by women with independent tastes. That's why I hail the new reviewers, who don't give a damn about the hype of yesteryear - you guys cannot imagine how ostracized you would have been back in the day. Sgt. Pepper just isn't that great an album; it is, instead, an example of what happens when you're so rich that the cost of studio time is of no consequence and you can just come in when you please, having had your gentlemantly british breakfast or something, play with toys and gadgets for a few hours, then go do something more fun and return whenever you feel like it. It's a collection of playtimes by the rich and talented, recorded for posterity. Talented, of course: we won't deny that these playtimes sound much better than my playtimes. And just to make sure we're on the same page: yes, A Day in the Life is pretty incredible. Wish the rest of the album were on that level.

B00275EGX8|3.0|The thing I thought was really excellent about this was the editing.  Notice how as things are getting tenser, the cuts become quicker?<br /><br />Seems to capture what I imagine to be a characteristic of life in an EOD team, and in war generally:  nail-biting tension as you think something's going to happen, then nothing happens.  Then, no tension, then something unexpected happens.  Rarely do expectation and reality seem to converge.<br /><br />After watching this, danged if you don't feel like you were embedded in a sapper group in Iraq for a couple of weeks!<br /><br />UPDATE:  I was stunned last night to see this movie receive at least two major Oscars:  directing and picture.  Holy cow!  What a shame:  though no big fan of the anti-American \\"Avatar,\\" that film was a lot better than this.  This one had forgettable characters and what little plot there was was confusing.  It was an underdog at the Oscars.  But the thing often forgotten about underdogs is that they're underdogs for a reason:  they're usually correctly perceived as inferior.  This is a movie I would never dream of seeing again, yet it won those Oscars!?  Reminds me a bit of 1977:  \\"Annie Hall\\" won for Best Picture, but that movie is forgotten now.  \\"Star Wars,\\" like \\"Avatar,\\" went home with only a couple of technical Oscars.

B0000DZ3EA|5.0|Peter Gabriel's 2-CD best of called Hit (or Hit and Miss as the CDs are called themselves) was released in November of 2003.<br />This collection spans the original lead singer of Genesis Peter Gabriel's adventurous solo career from 1977 to 2002.<br />Most of his albums are represented sans 1978's underrated second album also known as Scratch, the soundtracks to Birdy and The Passion of the Christ and the two live albums Peter Gabriel Plays Live and Secret World Live.<br />From the self-titled 1977 solo effort a/k/a Car we have his first solo hit \\"Solsbury Hill\\" which is one of his best tracks. Another track from that album \\"Here Comes the Flood\\" is here in an version recorded on the 1990 Shaking the Tree best of.<br />His 1980 masterpiece a/k/a Car is represented by \\"I Don't Remember\\", \\"Family Snapshot\\", \\"Games Without Frontiers\\" and of course my favorite on that album \\"Biko\\". All key choices.<br />His 1982 fourth album (known as Security here in the States) is represented by his first big US hit \\"Shock The Monkey\\", \\"San Jacinto\\" and \\"The Rhythm Of the Heat\\". All good choices except \\"I Got the Touch\\" is not here but that's life and in the words of Mick Jagger \\"You Can't always get what you want but if you try sometimes you find you get what you need\\".<br />His 1986 masterpiece So is well represented by \\"Red Rain\\", his only US #1 hit single \\"Sledgehammer\\", the powerful duet with Kate Bush called \\"Don't Give Up\\", \\"Big Time\\" and of course \\"In Your Eyes\\". All superb choices.<br />The 1992 proper follow-up Us is well represented by \\"Digging In The Dirt\\", \\"Steam\\" (in its single form), \\"Blood of Eden\\" and \\"Love to Be Loved\\". Only missing is \\"Come Talk to Me\\" and \\"Kiss That Frog\\" but that would have been a 3-CD set (and why not).<br />His recent album of all new material 2002's Up is represented by \\"Growing Up\\" (in a remixed form), \\"Signal to Noise\\", \\"More Than This\\" (in edited form), \\"The Drop\\" and \\"I Grieve\\". Great choices IMHO.<br />There's also one previously unreleased song, the great rocker \\"Burn You Up Burn You Down\\" (an out-take from the Up sessions).

I say Peter should put out a box set including some harder to find tracks like \\"Out Out\\" recorded for the Gremlins soundtrack and the recent Oscar nominated \\"Down to Earth\\" from Wall-E.

B00000D9TQ|5.0|Genesis singer/drummer Phil Collins released his first proper greatest hits album entitled Phil Collins Hits in October of 1998.<br />This compilation compiles all of Phil's hit singles up until 1998. When I first heard of the best of being released I thought are they either going to use live tracks from Serious Hits Live with the classic non-album singles or use the studio versions. When I heard it was the latter, I bought and what a compilation.<br />His 1981 solo debut Face Value is represented by the classic \\"In the Air Tonight\\" which was the first hit (UK #2 and US #19) he had as a solo artist and a great song I must add to this day and only track from Face Value here (\\"I Missed Again (the first single in the US which was also charted at #19) is missing why I don't know).<br />His 1982 solo effort Hello, I Must Be Going is represented by his first US Top 10 hit out of his re-make of The Supremes' \\"You Can't Hurry Love\\" and a great choice. Some are shocked of no \\"I Don't Care Anymore\\" as that was a US rock radio hit but the rule Pop hits had to be applied.<br />His 1985 monster seller No Jacket Required is represented by the #1's \\"One More Night\\" and \\"Sussudio\\" and the Top 10 \\"Take Me Home\\". Great choices but many noted the Top 5 \\"Don't Lose My Number\\" is sadly missing.<br />His 1989 chart topping ...But Seriously is well represented out of \\"Another Day in Paradise\\" (a #1 in late 1989), \\"I Wish It Would Rain Down\\" (a huge rock radio smash and Top 5 Pop hit with Eric Clapton on guitar) and \\"Something Happened On the Way to Heaven\\" (another big hit).<br />His 1993 album Both Sides is only represented by \\"Both Side of the Story\\". The song \\"Everyday\\" was a hit but not as big as the first single apparently.<br />His return to the 1980s formular solo album from 1996 entitled Dance Into the Light is represented by the title cut and a great song I must add.<br />Now the real reasons to acquire is for the studio version of \\"Easy Lover\\" which was Phil's hit duet with Earth Wind and Fire singer Philip Bailey (that groups horn section played on all of Phil's solo efforts from the 1980s and on Genesis' Abacab and US version of Three Sides Live albums), the studio version of his hit ballad \\"Against All Odds\\" (which was his first #1 as a solo artist and was theme to film of same name), the studio version of his duet with Marilyn Martin called \\"Separate Lives\\" from the 1985 film White Nights and the two #1's from the 1988 film Buster out of \\"A Groovy Kind of Love\\" (best version of song IMHO) and \\"Two Hearts\\" both of which hit #1 in the US. We also have a new recording of Cyndi Lauper's 1986 hit \\"True Colors\\" produced and collaborated by then-red hot R&B singer/producer/songwriter Babyface.<br />Phil Collins Hits would go on to Triple Platinum in US sales and another Top 20 album for him (to date his last).<br />Recommended!Bailey (that groups horn section played on all of Phil's solo efforts from the 1980s and on Genesis' Abacab and US version of Three Sides Live albums), the studio version of his hit ballad \\"Against All Odds\\" (which was his first #1 as a solo artist and was theme to film of same name), the studio version of his duet with Marilyn Martin called \\"Separate Lives\\" from the 1985 film White Nights and the two #1's from the 1988 film Buster out of \\"A Groovy Kind of Love\\" (best version of song IMHO) and \\"Two Hearts\\" both of which hit #1 in the US.

0307266303|5.0|This book brought back lots of memories of my former visits to the Tarahumara canyons but also educated me much more about the science and practice of endurance running. Videos can be found at YouTube which provide images of the exciting race. The premise of the book is that the human race evolved and prevailed aided by a superior capacity for endurance running (see chapter 28). When the human line separated from the great apes about two million years ago and walked upright out onto the grassy plains of Africa, spears and other hunting tools had not yet been developed, but humans were able to run down game. The book even describes such a hunt in modern times by Kalahari bushmen. It explains that when a four footed mammal runs, its breath rate is limited by its leaps: every contraction of the body squeezes the lungs and every leap forward expands the lungs. This bellows effect is perfected in flexible cats and rabbits. Even so, a faster breath rate does not compensate enough for the oxygen deficit and heat buildup which accumulate due to increased metabolism. Naked humans can cool off by sweating but hairy quadrupeds have to dissipate heat by panting, not possible for them while running.  The upright carriage of the human body decouples the breath rate from the stride, permitting hyper breathing to sustain continuous running.  McDougall suggests that modern humans prevailed over the beefy Neanderthals because of this superior ability to run down animals on the open range, when a warming climate changed the European forests to grasslands and the large animals on which the Neanderthals depended died out.  The smaller homo sapiens bodies could run farther with less expenditure of energy. The book also reminds me of the importance of daily exercise, the joys of a healthy body and the benefit of a simple mostly vegetarian diet such as the Tarahumara staples of beans and pinole corn.

B001PR0YDA|5.0|I just saw this one in the theater.  I chose the 3-D showing.  You know the famous Charles Dickens' story.  It is the same basic story line, but done in the computer animation that makes the characters look about as close to human as possible, at least for now.  I almost forget they are not real, except the eyes never look quite right.  The computer graphics are phenomenal, the color is beautiful, and the picture is sharp.  If you saw Disney's Polar Express, it is the same animation quality.  It is hard for me to believe this is Jim Carrey.  It doesn't even sound like him.  He does a fantastic job with Scrooge.  I watch the Scrooge story every Christmas season, probably several times.<br /><br />The story begins on Christmas Eve.  Jacob Marley has died and Scrooge has made arrangements with the undertaker for a nice wooden box.  Scrooge reluctantly pays the undertaker and whisks around to scarf up the tuppences that lay on Marley's eyes, telling a young boy that it is money (and not to be wasted).<br /><br />The sun is shining brightly outside and the snow is lightly falling, providing a multi-dimensional effect while wearing your 3-D glasses.  Snow falls through most of the picture.  We hear singing and move through the streets of old London, watching the street vendors hulk their wares.  Scrooge moves through the streets, grouching the whole time.  It's what he does best, you know.  As Scrooge enters the storefront marked by the sign \\"Scrooge and Marley,\\"  the \\"M\\" begins to wiggle.<br /><br />Fast forward 7 years, to the anniversary of Marley's death.  We find Scrooge and Bob Cratchett working in the cold, cold office on Christmas Eve.  Cratchett is freezing his little buns off but dare not place another chunk of coal on the fire.  As a matter of fact, I think the coal box had a lock on it.  (Heck, one piece of coal is enough.  Who needs feeling in their fingers anyway?)  Nephew Fred stops by to visit Uncle Scrooge and gets the bah humbug routine.  The two gents come in, asking for a donation for charity and Scrooge delivers the famous \\"Let them die and decrease the surface population\\" line.<br /><br />Scrooge closes for the evening, reminding Cratchett it is not fair that he be off all day on Christmas, being paid for no work, and he need be there early on December 26!  They part company, Cratchett scurrying to be merry and Scrooge grouching home to be Scrooge.<br /><br />The fun begins as we see Scrooge's door knocker come alive, glowing with Marley's face!  Scrooge is seriously creeped out, even after he runs upstairs and locks everthing behind him.  As he cowers in his chair, the 4 bells above the inside of his door begin to ring, no BANG--loudly, followed by the entrance of (guess who?) J-A-C-O-B  M-A-R-L-E-Y!<br /><br />Of course, like I said, you know the story.  The 3 ghosts visit and the computer animations allow for a nice level of visual entertainment as they take Scrooge to the past, present, and the possible future.  Through a mixture of heart-touching rememberances, fear, and compassion, they remind Scrooge that it is NOT all about HIM!  This story is an excellent reminder of the importance of carrying love and compassion and opening your heart to others, for without our heart-centers, we dry up inside.<br /><br />This is a great rendition of the classic, I don't care how many times you have seen the story before.<br /><br />Disney done it again! Enjoy!onation for charity and Scrooge delivers the famous \\"Let them die and decrease the surface population\\" line.

0385333846|5.0|\\"Slaughterhouse- Five\\" is a novel that at its core is about the very meaning of human existence. Are we merely going through the motions of life, or do we control our destinies?  What are our obligations to our fellow humans? Is there any great design to the universe and our lives? There is nothing new in those questions, but the way that Mr. Vonnegut examines these questions is still unique and relevant, decades after this novel's first publication.<br />The novel's protagonist is Billy Pilgrim, whose metaphorical name gives insight into his journey. Billy Pilgrim goes through life; he does not participate in it. Billy believes that all action is preordained, and thus he lets life happen to him. Yet despite this pathetic choice, Billy is an everyman worth rooting for. He is content with his lot, even if we the readers are not content with his passivity.<br />Like the best novels, S5 lets the reader choose what the right thing is, and allows more than one side to every issue. Vonnegut has managed to write a book about war, human nature, natural selection, religious belief, death, history, and the value of choice in one's life. He tackles these plethora of themes in a novel that encapsulates time travel, aliens, WW II, and the humdrum of middle class life. Now that is a feat.<br />And the greatest thing about this novel is that every read yields new insights and lessons. Its themes are vast, and its pleasures continue to grow. I have read it over six times, and I learn something new each time. It is simplistically written and executed, but it is a work that is very deep and wide.<br />Read and think and you will not be disappointed!
0783114893|5.0|This is not something I would normally watch these days, but I saw it in 1984 and remembered that it was one scary movie!  (OMG! 25 years ago!!!--seems like yesterday!)  My son left it next to the computer, so I picked it up and watched it again.  Left my stomach a bit unsettled, but for those who like this kind of flick, I must admit it is a good one, with a fine performance by Rutger Hauer as one bad-axx, cold-blooded murderer.  If you want to impress on your teenager not to pick up strangers, this movie should do it.  But, please, do not show it to young children.  It is 98 minutes of gut-gripping terror!<br /><br />It begins with some creepy music, while you wonder if you should really select \\"play\\" or not.  More creepy music continues as a young C. Thomas Howell/Jim Halsey, maybe age 18/20, lights his ciggie as he is driving a car through the long desert road at dusk.  He is starting to get a little sleepy as darkness approaches and he drowns himself in caffeine from his large thermos.  Fast forward to 4:30 a.m. , daybreak approaches in the darkness as lightening flashes and thunder crashes behind the background mountains. We learn that Howell is driving a Caddie to San Diego for some guy.<br /><br />Here comes the heavy rain.  OMG!  No!  Don't fall asleep!  Honk!  Whew!  That was close.  Shake it off.  The rain is pouring, and there's a hitch-hiker--out in the middle of nowhere.  Young Mr. Howell stops! Geeze!  Don't you know any better?  The Hitcher (Rutger Hauer/John Rider) opens the door and gets in the car.  Here comes the opening line of a nightmare that goes on and on and on.  You will probably remember this line for the rest of your life when Howell says to Hauer, \\"My mother told me never to do this.\\"<br /><br />It only took a few minutes for Hauer to get creepy.  Howell tries stopping the car and telling him to get out, but it don't work.  They pass a car on the side and Hauer starts telling Howell how he cut up the guy in that car and that Howell is next.  This begins the road to hell as Hauer threatens Howell and causes intense fear all along the way.  One minute Howell gets rid of Hauer and the next minute he is back again.  This kid does the dumbest things, but then that's what makes the movie.  You find yourself screaming on the inside, \\"Nooooo!

B0026P3G12|5.0|In a time when things can be so negative and we face wars and economic crisis there comes a small beacon of light through the story and music of Susan Boyle.  Susan's talent is worthy of an album ... but her story makes her platinum!  Like a good, heartfelt movie ... Susan's underdog story can reach into the hearts of all people and send the message that dreams really come true if you try.<br /><br />The album consists of an array of songs with huge variety.  She sings musicals, standards, spirituals and some pop.  I am not sure where her genre will end up or if she will create her own.  One thing is for sure, her talent and story make for a heartwarming blend of music.  You can feel it when you listen.  Her dream has come true.  She gives us all hope to dream a little more.<br /><br />Way to go Susan!  I recommend the album as an uplifting addition to anyone's collection.
B00005OWEG|4.0|I won't, I can't, forget this movie. I'm sure--had my draft number been higher--this movie would affect me even more, had I survived Vietnam. The horror. . .    Yet for all its power, the film is far less compelling than \\"Heart of Darkness\\". And Vietnam, for all its contemporary tragedy, is far less tragic than the \\"civilizing\\" of colonial powers. (Or is Vietnam just a recent addition to that tale of \\"civilization\\"?)    After watching \\"Apocalypse Now Redux\\" yet again and rereading \\"Heart of Darkness\\" yet again, I was bothered by this irksome detail: Nowhere, nowhere in the film or credits does Francis Ford Coppola explicitly credit Joseph Conrad. The horror. . .the horror.
B00005B36H|5.0|Progressive rock/metal is one of my favorite genres and Tool's Lateralus is up there with the best albums I have experienced. Some of the best progressive music out there along with Queensryche's \\"Operation: Mindcrime\\" and Dream Theaters \\"Images and Words\\", possibly even better but I'd rather not compare albums. Their sound expanded from Aenima a lot along with a more structured sound and cleaner production. The songs are so different from each other such as heavier tracks like \\"Ticks and Leeches\\", the disturbing and intense \\"Faaip De Oiad\\" and the epic 3 track song \\"Disposition\\", \\"Reflection\\" and \\"Triad\\" which is one of the greatest songs ever recorded. Lateralus is a lot different from the bands out there today, it shows how Tool are unique and write intelligent music.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|Japanese films have always had the remarkable reputation of turning the simplest premise into something so full of moving emotions and sensibilities. Yojiro Takita's multi-award winning film \\"DEPARTURES\\" (2008) is no different. There is a lot of excessive hype surrounding the film as it has almost nearly swept the Japanese Academy awards and has been awarded the Best Foreign film honor in the recent 2009 Oscars. No film can live up to the hype it has gotten, but I have to say it has earned each and every recognition; well deserving of the commercial success it had achieved in its native land.<br /><br />Daigo Kobayashi (Masahiro Motoki) is a cello player whose dream is shattered when the orchestra he is playing with goes broke. Left with no choice but to sell his prized cello, Daigo together with his wife Mika (beauteous Ryoko Hirosue) returns to his hometown to live in his mother's old house.  In need of a new job, Daigo responds to an ad in the local paper for a job in \\"Departures\\", thinking that it may be related to travel. But much to his surprise and dismay, Daigo discovers that he had applied for a profession as an `Encofineer'; a man who performs the delicate and traditional Japanese ritual of preparing the bodies of the deceased for the departure to the next life--it pays quite well, and without even thinking about it, he accepts without even giving his wife the details of his new job.<br /><br />It is not often that we become privy to a film about the beautifying of corpses, director Takita takes on the grim subject matter and gives it a commercial charm and appeal. The direction is quite meticulous in exposing the world of the mortician as we become witnesses to the Japanese customs and traditions as to how they deal with their dead. Takita shows that the profession demands a certain amount of sensitivity as we see the different reactions of those left behind by the deceased; some are angry, some are funny, most are overwhelmed by grief and some are curiously joyful. In Daigo's profession, there are no religious affiliation; they do what they do to preserve the memory of the deceased, remembering them as the way they used to be and not who they are in the present.<br /><br />It is a safe bet that a premise such as this may be unusual even for Japanese audiences and one of the film's key to success is the way it executes its grim subject matter through some doses of subtle humor in the film's first act. Writer Kundo Koyama and the direction by Takita meticulously eases the premise into the audience, as we were privy to Daigo and Sasaki's encounter with an extra \\"thing\\" to a supposedly female corpse. We see Masahiro Motoki's deadpan humor as he becomes repulsed by his first job, and just how he eventually becomes comfortable with his new career. Takita cleverly illustrates the short moments in the ceremony that our morticians get to know the deceased quite intimately.<br /><br />After everything sinks in, then the emotional scenes begin to take hold, as we learn more of Daigo's childhood, his problems with his wife's disapproval of his new job and his anger towards his father who had left him while he was a child to run off with a younger woman. Now this is a commercial film and we know that eventually people close to Daigo will eventually come to respect what he does for a living, it is a little predictable but the journey with which the film gets to where it wishes to go is well-played that the screenplay becomes somewhat of a melancholy with a rhythm that just looks so beautiful. Mika (played by Ryoko Hirosue) is just so lovable as the diligent wife; she is just so full of love and trust that her character represents the goodness within the Japanese woman. It was touching to see Daigo perform a ceremony in his wife's presence and director Takita carefully manipulates the camera work to show pure emotion. Takita also injects some sequences that are beautiful to awaken the emotion (sort of serves as a vanguard) as wesee Daigo playing the cello on a hill as if he was reaching out again to his dreams. The film also has beautiful cinematography and emotion-inducing score to match its otherwise simple but grim premise to keep the film running at a brisk pace.<br /><br />The film has two significant scenes that seemed to induce quite a few sniffles, they were injected to give a twist that plays a significant part in Daigo's life. The first one does provoke a lot of emotion; it is full of tear-inducing sequences that can definitely touch its audience. However, it does feel a little overlong that the second twist may lose some of the narrative impact to the inexperienced viewer. The two twists do work in unison in the screenplay but some may argue that Takita was working too hard to induce emotion working one twist right after the other. I didn't find anything wrong with it and I thought it stuck to its sensibilities in reflecting just how life can sometimes throw you in for a curve.<br /><br />The performances are quite good, Motoki (who won best actor in Japan) and Hirosue has some dynamic chemistry between them and the supporting characters made up of Sasaki, Yuriko (co-employee played by Kimiko Yo) and the woman (Kazuko Yoshiyuki) who runs a bath house plays their own significance in the script. I loved the way Yamazaki played Sasaki, it was like a cool and quiet boss as he always seemed to say \\"its fine.\\"<br /><br />Despite some flaws in the screenplay that the film came dangerously close in becoming too sentimental, \\"Departures\\" is easily one of the best commercial films to come out from Japan. The last act will leave an impression that no matter how we see ourselves and others, death sometimes is the one thing that can bring a family together. The film's biggest ace would have to come from its ability to induce the proper emotion at the right minute with such simplicity. Such critical acclaim will no doubt raise the film to unreasonable expectations, and while it may not change the course of Japanese cinema, it is not pretentious and never hides behind its beautiful visual style. The way to approach this film is with tempered expectations, so that the film can touch you in its journey that is both surprising and pleasurable.<br /><br />Highly Recommended! [4 ½ + Stars]<br /><br />The release looks great and sounds great. The 1.78 ratio anamorphic widescreen video transfer is vivid and clean. It also has a 5.1 Dolby Digital Track Japanese language track. Subtitles are well timed and translated.on a hill as if he was reaching out again to his dreams.

B002KAJ0AO|5.0|No matter what! No matter the year! The BackStreet Boys will ALWAYS Be NUMBER ONE!<br />I've been a fan since the beginning & I WILL NEVER STOP being a fan!... I'm Ryan (all the way from Malta, Europe - near Italy) ... When I heard Straight through my heart I got shivers man!!! I do every time I hear that beautiful song! The minute the music starts and then Brian goes \\"Ooh, oh, oh, oh...\\" I get up if I'm sitting on my Pc's chair and I feel like dancing to it and sing along!!! The BSB's music has helped me throughout the years, I was like 12/13 when the BSB started, now I'm 25! And it's good to see the BSB are still goin' strong!! In 2005 at their release of NEVER GONE... I had just been through a real bad time in 2004 coz of this car accident whic occurred due to this thrombosis I had whilst driving back home... and I could relate to the song from that album.. BSB evolved in their music... I felt like I had evolved with them... it's a never-ending process... TIME...look where we are and what we've been through... that was a gr8 song from BLACK & BLUE... and it's true you know, time changes everything, but, the BSB keep changing (and now kind of back to where they started) which is giving me those chills I used to have when I used to hear/sing/dance to all the tracks from their self-titled DEBUT album in EUROPE, coz later they released another version of BACKSTREET BOYS for the US! ... Well, what more can one say? Guys and gals... don't critisize the guys ... THIS IS US is another brilliant album - Let's all KEEP THE BACKSTREET PRIDE ALIVE in the name of GOOD MUSIC! I have just ordered my copy of THIS IS US from Amazon! Can't wait till I play it on my stereo!!! ... In the heart, of the night... Man! BSB's music makes me happy, even the ballads (the sad ballads) for their gr8 voices! My fave pop band! RESPECT! Ryan ;)

B0026P3G12|5.0|OMG!  What a beautiful album and so well done.  I will be listening to it many times.  Susan moves me when she sings, they are not just songs to her. \\"You'll See\\", well I almost feel as if I can experience Susan's feelings as she sings.  You will enjoy this one,,,singing with power, or the softest and clearest of voices.  Beautiful!!<br /><br />I want to thank Simon and crew for finding Susan for the world, it will be a better place with her albums to keep me company.  And thanks to Susan for hanging in there all these years to share her beautiful voice with us all.
B002MW50KO|3.0|Some songs on this CD are just fun and while Dylan's voice isn't perfect he relates a fun and festive feel. If people accept Jimmy Durante doing Christmas songs than why not Dylan? His voice isn't that far removed, and the production and arrangements are often top notch. \\"Here Comes Santa Claus\\" is a delight. But then he'll turn around and do \\"The Christmas Song\\" in a way that displays all is vocal weakness. Over all it is a fun effort that Dylan allows us to smile through because he's having the most fun since the Traveling Wilburys.  However some of these songs should have remained in the studio.  But if you don't at least find some holiday pleasure in this effort, well \\"Bah Humbug\\" to you too!
B002VECM40|4.0|Precious takes you on an emotional journey that you will not likely forget. There are some remarkable performances but the only one that stands out is Monique's character. She plays an abusive mother that knowingly let her daughter be molested. She actually blames Precious for her man leaving. She is so full of self hatred and anger it's hard to see how Precious has survived this long. The young lady playing Precious does a great job of portraying how broken Precious is. Precious's imagination is the only thing that gives her a break from all the abuse. I can't imagine anyone else playing the role of Precious. Mariah Carey  has a small part in this movie. Her acting skills have improved but wow she looks really old without makeup. Some people will go to see this thinking that it's one of those inspirational movies. This is not one of those movies where at the end something positive happens and things start to look up for the main character. Things look even worse for Precious at the end of this film. Please keep an open mind. I actually wanted to give this movie 5 stars but it feels unfinished. You feel a little cheated at the end of the movie because nothing is resolved. However, Precious is easily one of the most captivating films i've seen in awhile. Not only is this one a Must See, you have to buy this one. It will be a welcomed edition to my dvd collection. HOLLA
B000UR9TQE|5.0|If you are a fan of Led Zeppelin this is a must. Think it was good at the theater, try it on your 50 \\" HD with the 5.1 selected. This is a return to the days of Rock.

B0026P3G12|5.0|Again, Susan Boyle has outdone the critics.  Although the songs are contrastingly different, she has harmonized and woven the CD album into a beautiful masterpiece.  Those who like Bette Midler's voice range will like Susan's also.  The quality of her voice matches other recognized artists as well: Madonna's \\"You'll See\\" song which Susan plays on the album is sung better than Madonna herself (Judge for yourself).  The orchestra and backup musicians were outstanding.  If there is anything critically to say: it is that on some songs her music handlers didn't let her reach higher transcending notes with added force (the choir over-powered her).  This is obvious on \\"Amazing Grace\\" and \\"How Great Thou Art.\\"  The handlers need to let Susan be Susan.  I expect the next album to be transcendent, a 5.0.
B002KREVCO|4.0|... how complete you want your AC/DC collection to be. This patches up some up some holes. Every studio song released by AC/DC since Bon Scott became their singer is now available stateside. I'd be lying if I said that means that we have a holy grail here. A couple of these songs are classics (\\"Crapsody In Blue\\" and \\"Cold Hearted Man\\") but I'd have been able to live a full and fruitful life had I never had heard \\"Love Song\\" (an AC/DC power ballad and you thought there was no such animal). The Brian songs range from passable to forgetable. What's missing are the Australian edits of songs long available here that appear om the shamefully overpriced full version of this boxset and the Dave Evans 45 which has a better than Bon version of \\"Can I Sit Next To You Girl\\" - apparently the boys are gonna make us wait on that.<br /><br />The live disc is nice but inessential for the most part.<br /><br />The Family Jewels 3 Dvd again patches up some holes. It's something worth having but how often you gonna pull it out?<br /><br />This is definitely worth the money that Amazon is selling this for but I seen prices around $40.00 at the Best Buys and such. Even a diehard like me would have problems shelling that out.
B00004VVNB|5.0|Ah, 1975.  Black Sabbath releases \\"Sabotage.\\"  Saigon falls.  (Incidentally, this also just happens to be the year of my birth.)  Finally, Michael Anderson's sci-fi epic \\"Logan's Run\\" is filmed (primarily on location in Dallas, Texas), though the film would see release the following summer, just in time for the bicentennial.    I first saw this movie in a showing on WTBS when I was in high school.  That was the better part of 20 years ago, and until I recently bought the DVD, I had not seen it since.  I am happy to report that this film, now nearly 35 years old (like me, sigh), has aged remarkably well.  It seems to be heavily influenced by classic '60s \\"Star Trek,\\" but that was a show so far ahead of its time as to be timeless, and so is \\"Logan's Run.\\"  It has all the basic qualities of \\"Trek\\" -- it is beautiful to look at, and seeing it on the print I viewed it on DVD is especially revealing.  It possesses that lustrous technicolor image quality that you just don't see in movies anymore.  And it presents sights that you just didn't see in motion pictures up to that point in the pre-\\"Star Wars\\" era.  This was back at a time when all special effects had to be manually crafted from scratch, whereas today's video game like computer generated effects can have a less imaginative and more sterile quality to them.  It came as no surprise that this film won a special Academy award for these very visual effects that I refer to.    Not only are the special effects beautiful to look at, but just like vintage \\"Star Trek,\\" it presents legions of young, gorgeous women in extremely short skirts (and sometimes much less), not the least of which is then 22-year-old British actress Jenny Agutter, co-starring as Jessica 6.  Here she was a mesmerisingly beautiful girl, and her quaint English charm and mannerisms don't hurt a bit.  My eyes were glued to the screen every moment she was on.    Sci-fi movies were not too common during the first half of the '70s, and \\"Logan's Run\\" was truly revolutionary, and while influenced by \\"Trek\\" it proved to serve as an influence for a fair share of pictures of its own in the years to follow.  For the sets, 1980's \\"Flash Gordon\\" comes to mind.  And I've never heard this stated as such, but I think that some plot points from \\"Logan's Run\\" would serve as an influence to John Carpenter for his 1981 futuristic sci-fi actioner \\"Escape From New York\\" (another favorite of mine).  The very fact that Logan (Michael York) will cease to exist if he doesn't complete his mission recalls Snake Plisskin's essential plight in \\"Escape.\\"  Finally, the restricted quadrant that the two leads enter early on in \\"Logan's Run,\\" which is actually an abandoned cathedral, reminds me of Carpenter's Manhattan Island of the near future in \\"Escape,\\" as they both are crumbling areas of lawlessness away from civilization, filled with roaming bloodthirsty criminals (in Carpenter's film they were dubbed \\"the Crazies\\").    All in all, with its amazing effects, great acting and sense of fun and adventure, \\"Logan's Run\\" is a classic through and through and comes highly recommended to any fans of the old \\"Star Trek\\" or any other vintage sci-fi.
B002KDUDG6|2.0|Dangerously close to Muzak.  It's not the Sinatraisms, the Boy Croonerisms (Frankie Avalon, Bobby Rydell, Neil Sedaka, et al.), or the retread arrangements, it's the lack of art.  Sinatra was an innovator, and a superb actor, who mined the subtext of lyrics with a sensitive intelligence, and who constantly grew as an artist. Buble is not in his league, and not even in the majors.  There is nothing here to indicate a life experience deeper or more recent than high school romance.  A conceit may account for the selection of songs, but there is no dramatic arc, and this is not a concept album -- it's a hodgepodge of borrowed styles.  At this moment, at least, there is no there there.
0385504225|1.0|This book irritates me on so many levels.  Firstly, Robert Langdon keeps going on and on about his disbelieve of the myth.  I can't believe how many words or sentences are wasted on this.  It's repetitive and doesn't serve any purpose to advance the plot or build the character. It's a waste of ink and paper.  Next, the villain is one-dimensional.  Yet again and again, so many words are wasted on describing how the villain tattoos himself.  Finally, the final plot twist is laughable.  If you're a fan, you probably won't miss this book anyway. If you're neutral to Dan Brown's previous books like me, I'd suggest skipping this book. I wish I hadn't wasted my time.

This is in no way classic megadeth, but it is close. What I love is Megadeth has never truly sold out. Dave got a little commercial for a few albums but he will always be a hero of metal, unlike metallica, who sold out completely. Nerds and rednecks won't be listening to Megadeth, but you can find a copy of S&M in the desk drawer of the nerds and the remakes of \\"Turn the Page\\" and \\"Whiskey In The Jar\\" in the dusty truck seats of Southern boys. Keep rocking Dave, us die hards will keep supporting.

Donna is a fantastic companion, and we did not have to contend with the \\"unrequited love\\" situation.  For sheer terror ir is hard to beat \\"Midnight\\".  Alfred Hitchcock could not have done it better.  And \\"Turn Left\\" brought tears to my eyes.  I highly recommend for anyone, whether you are a sci-fi fan or not.
0385504225|2.0|I have read all Dan Brown's books and really appriciate the hard work and research that went into them. The Lost Symbol, however, seemed like a rush to the finish line, read like a screen play, and the twists and turns were not built up to that \\"no way\\" that you would get from the others. This book was unbelieveable at best. I can't see fans taking tours of D.C. the way they did in Rome over this book, and I absolutely hate the fact that Langdon didn't seem like the same guy he was in the first two, but more like Tom Hanks who absolutely murdered his charicter in the movie.  It's a shame. 500+ pages was a welcome follow-up, but in the end my time felt fairly wasted with this story. Dan Brown should consider a do-over on this one...and get back to the roots he started from, not go and change his charicters to adapt to the movie screen.
0385504225|2.0|The DVC wasn't the 'tough to follow' book, that was Angels and Demons. A&D was an exceptional book, DVC a good book (though the marketing was exceptional). I honestly feel this book is a bit of a disappointment. The repeated use of the hook, disbelief and then the reveal, caused me to give no credibility to events described. So if someone dies, I came to expect they weren't dead as I'd lean later. Most of the time I was right.    At it's core, The Lost Symbol is an endoresement of superstition and mysticism in the form of a novel. Verifiable fact is mixed with legend skillfully, so as to obscure truth, really what superstition and mysticism does best. It's sort of the antithesis of a crucible which burns away the irrelevant and unfounded.    I also felt the love interest in the story does not succeed emotionally as you follow it, it's pale and undefined in it's relationship to he characters.    Since this reveiw is not about Dan Brown (I don't think I could ever write an 'Angels and Demons'), but about the work, The Lost Symbol. If you feel the need for adventure in your life, and a belief in some ill-defined Ancient Wisdon, wrapped up in worship of a diety... this book may be for you. If not, you may, as I did, find its foundations to be the recognizable tribute to superstition.

B0015I2P0Y|5.0|The Seldom Seen Kid is my first Elbow record, but it won't be the last.  I've had it for a month and I can't stop playing it (very atypical for me).      There are so many things to like.  The songwriting is vastly original, both musically and lyrically.  No two songs sound the same or like anything else.  Six of the songs would get my highest rating, and all of them are interesting.  And they seem to get better each time, even after about 20 listenings!  The players are all excellent and I just love the understated delivery Garvey gives vocally.  Kudos to keyboardist/producer Craig Potter who has crafted a number of very natural and beautiful sounds, particularly from the keyboards and strings.  Finally, The Loneliness of a Tower Crane Driver is the most epic 5:15 song I've ever heard.    Enjoy!

0882709194|5.0|Contrary to what the \\"growing chorus\\" is saying on here, the book is the original Origin of Species with Ray Comfort's introduction. It's a shame that schools only teach the one side. The liberals and Atheists cry out against censorship when it comes to porn and profanity, but when a book gives both view points on the Origin of Species, they scream in fear saying that the man had no right to write what he did. Considering that Ray announced what this book was on Youtube, I'll bet that none of the Atheists who wrote these reviews have actually read the intro! Keep up the good work, Ray!
B002IR3PSC|3.0|First of all, since there is a companion CD, I can't see the point of including stand-alone audio of several tracks on the concert DVD. Just for the pictures? No point.<br /><br />Second, the absence of John Glascock has a negative effect over-all. He was Tull's most accomplished bassist and was a great presence on stage. Tony Williams does a fine job, but it's just not the same for this dyed-in-the-wool Tuller.<br /><br />I was greatly looking forward to seeing No Lullaby performed, but the performance here is nowhere near as good as the one on Bursting Out. The flute break, however, is the highlight of the whole show.<br /><br />I guess I am getting tired of the same songs being hashed out over and over and over: Aqualung and Locomotive Breath in particular. Great songs, but with such a vast catalog this fixation on a few hit tunes does a disservice to Tull's work as a whole. I realize this was 1978, and also that they needed to cater to concert-goers who were paying to see these songs, but still, from the perspective of 2009, I guess I'm a bit jaded.<br /><br />Love Tull, but failed to get too excited over this DVD.

B001NEK2GE|2.0|As a part-time older FPS gamer, I am always on the lookout for items to help me gain an even small edge over uber-pwners who usually eat me for lunch. The different controllers I have used over the years run the gamut from the Microsoft Sidewinder Dual Strike, the Ideazon Fang game pad and different versions of the Belkin Nostromo. I use other Logitech products, including the G9 gaming mouse and was eager to try the G13 gameboard after reading reviews on the Logitech website.    In short, I am unimpressed. The gameboard certainly is asthetically pleasing, and sets up fairly easily. The board comes with several preinstalled games including Battlefield 2. However, I have had difficulty setting up other FPS games such as Operation Flashpoint.  Perhaps I should have remembered problems I have had with programming mice using Setpoint in the past. And possibly, I am just not as tech savvy or sophisticated as I need to be to use this device. Anyway, I simply haven't been able to set up the board the way I wanted. And when using it, I encountered difficulty even with some of the preinstalled games, including the aforementioned BF2. I can't put my finger on it but sometimes the controller keys don't work as programmed. My kill/death ratio fell precipitously over a weekend of using the board. Also, the vaunted LCD, while a neat idea, doesn't seem to add much to an individual game and I actually found it distracting.     So I am back to my familiar n52te, which certainly isn't perfect either. I am eagerly awaiting software/firmware upgrades that will make the G13 easier for me to use. I think the G13 is ideal for someone who has used one of Logitech's gaming keyboards, and wants to move to something smaller.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Well... i have always admired Michael Jackson... his music... his energy,, his originality, his genious.. but never felt him that close.. When i knew about this film, i didnt know what to hope, but i knew i had to watch it.  Now i saw this film, what its the most close experience to meet him in a concert, I understand what Michael means, his magic, the way he moves the people, your felt him inside you... he is extraordinary.  Now i feel i love him, i admire him, i cant stop listening his music, watching his videos, youtube, everything i can, i cant just get tired. This man actually changed my life.    The inspiration is there with him, you see this amazing and talented person, and you are happy because is a gift, and then you realized he is gone, what a huge lost. Its really great for his fans to see him enjoying singing, enjoying what he is doing, and in a personal stuff, he seems like a real angel.. and since now, he is that for me, an angel and my closest friend.    I have watched this movie 10 times, and i cant wait for my DVD, i think here in Colombia the movie is not be longer presented, i am very sad about that.    I think, any Michael Jackson' fan will enjoy this more than enything else in the world.    Michael Jackson, for me, is one of the greatest gifts from God, that we never have been able to deserve.
B00005JNS0|5.0|This review is short and sweet. What a wonderful movie for anyone of any age! It presents values without preaching, it has humor, and it aptly displays a nostalgia for days when driving the highways of America was an experience, not merely a means of getting from here to there as fast as one can. Thanks to this movie, I try to find stretches of road that evoke Americana when I travel. It doesn't hurt to venture more than a mile off the interstate. In fact, it's quite pleasant. And \\"Cars\\" reminds us of that.
1567184855|2.0|I have read this book, and am half way through the sequel..    At first I was amazed but, the more I read, the more it all sounded to far fetched.    My thoughts are, why didn't the Dr. ask the questions we all want to know?  Such as:    Where did humans some from?     What does the future hold for the earth?    Are we just pods for souls? I'm not sure I like the thought that souls invade our bodies for their own purposes.    If we are just pods, what is the point of having humans in the first place?    Was there a time when all humans were soul-less at some point in history?    Do we have our own personal identity, if not, are we then not who we think we are?    If there is no evil or negativity in the spirit world, why do we need to learn about in the first place. I see no point in this, even for the \\"experience\\".    Is there any validity to the Bible?    It mentions in the sequel that the earth is just an illusion, like a hologram... does that mean at any given moment it could all just vanish?    Also the part where it talks about our soul waiting for us to go to sleep so they can go out and play... really freaks me out.    I guess, I am more interested in the mundane facets of soul life.  All this study, study, study is too much for me to fathom.    Not sure I can buy into all of this, I want to... since I am searching but, this seems to be too much for me to believe at this point in my life.    I would recommend it to others, for the sole purpose of discussion.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|Any person who loves music, whether he/she knows of Leonard Cohen or not, should have this DVD. My wife and I were fortunate enough to see this same concert in Atlanta and I knew that we must have this performance so that we could relive it any time we wished. This master of song was indeed \\"born with the gift of a golden voice\\". To hear this 75-year-old man and his excellent entourage go through so many of his masterpieces is an experience that has no equal. As good as Cohen is, to add the craftsmanship of the musicians behind him and the solos of Sharon Robertson and the Webb sisters is completion of a 2 1/2-hour work of art. Cohen's music is like the gentle undulations of an eternal sea. Even when that sea does swell, it is with a controlled fury. This is as good as it gets. In fact, there is no musical performance better.
B000VE439Y|3.0|Although I don't believe it's the fault of the person I purchased it from, I did find my DVD case to have a dent in it as if someone from the post office stepped on it.   And I mean hard.  Fortunately the disc was undamaged and it's all good.   Thanks again.    Love Monty Python.
B002QGUFWE|2.0|I consider myself a Lady GaGa fan so I was excited to purchase her newest cd. Unfortunately, many of the songs sound like Europop and lack the funk or hip hop sound that many of \\"The Fame\\" songs have. If you like Europop music than this cd is for you but if you are looking for more of \\"The Fame\\" than you may be dissappointed.
B000000W6X|5.0|When Massive Attack's Blue Lines first appeared in 1991 the music was completely ground breaking and the lyrics hauntingly simply and beautiful and so welcomed by the world ready for that sort of message and the way of its delivery. Protection, delivered in 1994 by pretty much the same people grouped under the banner of Massive Attack not only did not disappoint us, but in many ways reinforced and upgraded the original feeling. Most of us where so glad to be able to place Massive Attack at the top if our then current music scene and watch them reap the rewards of their well deserved success. The significance of their music and lyrics was their focus on what brings us all together and their desire to work towards the good and common of all of us, by setting their vision straight ahead, rather than looking around to point out what bothers us about ourselves. There was good uniting energy layered between the novel sounds if our chilling, down tempo experience.<br /><br />The atmosphere of Protection feels as interesting to me today 15 years later as it did when it first came out. Protection is my favorite album by Massive Attack and it is not an easy choice to make. Fans of this band are most likely fairly equally divided between calling any one of their first 3 albums as their favorite. They are all great and I am choosing the middle one because I sense and I am attracted to the variation of mood which Protection delivers. I am very influenced by the lightness and the ambience of tone of this music.<br /><br />The title song Protection is my favorite song of this album. The lyric is simple and powerful, the voice of Tracy Thorn is perfect to bring her message across. Melodically this title song has two layers mixed into it. There is a rather simple bass and drum based melody but the underlying electronic mood escalates and develops beautifully. I would love to have that ambient background on its own, without the drum and bass and vocal tracks. That ambient mood dances around the base melody and sound which gives us the full effect of this song. Karmacoma might have he most techno feel to it. It is the first of 2 songs on this album where the song is performed by Tricky and 3D singing or rapping it in alternating succession and this song has their jointly singing parts as well. Three is one of the most beautiful songs of Protection. It is a soulful down tempo mood with great vocal by Nicolette and intriguing lyrics but the texture becomes much more dimensional by the echo of `three' rapped in the background. Weather Storm is an electronica ambient instrumental Craig Armstrong style with his unique piano playing. Spying Glass is sort of a distorted reggae song placed against the atmospheric background. Better Things has a dubbed bass feel to it musically but vocally and lyrically it is one of the best songs of the album. The difference of sound and mood and the overall dimension between Better Things and following it Eurochild is a perfect example of the greatness of this moody Protection. We are being taken from one place to another, completely different, with such ease and comfort. Eurochild is a beautiful dialog between Tricky and 3D and the sound is again Protection specific. This song is like Karmacoma played in the background with a beautiful melody playing over it and overpowering it. It is a great song with many elements and sounds coming together and taking us from place to place during these five minutes. Sly is another song sung by Nicolette. It is less complex musically and lyrics are leaving us...'wandering'... It is one of the weaker songs of this album and that is a complement. It is still a nice song. Heat Miser is a very nice instrumental reminding me of Craig Armstrong's influence again. He is the master of the mood created and sustained so well here. Picking a song by The Doors as a song to cover shows great taste on the part of Massive Attack as well as the desire to build new bridges between us. However it isnot my favorite cover by any means and the sound of this recording could be more interesting as well. To be honest, this is the only song of this album which I might end up skipping over, if I was to listen to this music on repeat with a remote control right next to me. Here are some of my favorite songs of Massive Attack and Tricky (up to 2009): Unfinished Sympathy. Protection, Dissolved Girl, Trinity Dub, Car Crash, Heat Miser, Three, Contradictive, Teardrop, Safe From Harm (perfecto mix), Evolution Revolution Love, Blue Lines, Angel, Better Things, Inertia Creeps, Hymn Of The Big Wheel.cover by any means and the sound of this recording could be more interesting as well.

044654146X|5.0|As a serial entrepreneur, VC and angel investor, and teacher of entrepreneurship for many years, I am enthralled by \\"Startup Nation\\". It is a fascinating story of how Israel has succeeded disproportionately to its size and certainly to its geographic situation. It teaches valuable and unique lessons about region building and industry building. The principles of the country that stimulate individual entrepreneurial behavior in the military, in agriculture, and especially in high technology are lessons for all. I have shared the book with several leaders of industry and finance who have seen it as a remarkably interesting read.  Congratulations to the authors.

B001AW9DKK|4.0|Reading over some of the other reviews here, there's a lot of political stuff dragging down the score on this record, and I don't think that's fair.  At least have the integrity to judge the record on its own merits, and not blast it because you don't agree with the message being conveyed.      That said, I'll try my best to be objective here, and let you know what you get with this album.  I apologize for the length ahead of time.    Breaking down the record, you basically have Neil Young, and CSN acting as a sort of extra-special backing band, playing the entirety of Neil's \\"Living With War\\" record and various CSN(Y) standards (likely chosen to fit in with the protest theme).  That comes to an album exactly of one hour and thirteen minutes, of which thirty-four minutes are vintage CSN(Y) material.  Also take note that the songs WILL sometimes fade in and fade out, implying this was taken from more than one show (a cardinal sin for live albums, in my opinion).    Having not listened to the studio version of Young's \\"Living With War\\", it still seems like it's performed faithfully, as in none of the songs spiral off into Crazy Horse jams.  Then again, this was never really the CSNY thing.  Seek out a review of the studio record for more thoughts on this.    The CSN(Y) standards here are really what you'll likely buy the record for, and they're rather uniformly good.  \\"Deja Vu\\" and \\"Wooden Ships\\" are both excellent, and both involve guitar duels between Stills and Young, with Young getting some particularly LETHAL tones this time around.  Nothing particularly different from the studio records in most cases though.  Biggest issue is Stills: though still an excellent guitarist, it's become obvious he's losing his hearing, and his singing greatly suffers as result.  Though \\"For What It's Worth\\" still ends up being quite good, it's the only song he's given lead vocals on due to his condition (Wooden Ships is handled by Nash and Crosby), and it's obvious WHY it's the onlysong.....    It's a mixed bag of a record, honestly, as CSNY live stuff tends to be.  Not awful by any means, and you DO get an entire Neil Young album by proxy when you buy this.  If the political context doesn't bother you, then go for it.  If, like many people who've given reviews here, you can't get over the politics, then it's obviously not for you, and you might wish to just download the CSN standards independently.      An average four, not approaching five, but not worth any less.
B002KH4KSY|1.0|Children of the Corn (2009): 1 out of 10: Good lord did they screw this movie up. First, the writer (George Goldsmith) who adapted the original Children of the Corn is some sort of savant. Apparently all the good scenes in the original movie (The killing of the adults, Isaac and Malachi going at it in the climax, were his invention.) This movie cut all that good stuff out and replaced it with the Viet Cong and public child sex.    The blame rests squarely on Mr. Stephen Kings shoulders. He did not like the changes the 1984 and wanted to stick to his original story. Therefore, the movie takes place in the mid-seventies and the main couple is a divorcing, squabbling mess. In addition, the main character hallucinates Viet Cong shooting in the corn which looks ten times worse than it sounds. Oh they have a sex scene in a church The time for fertilization has come! where two teens have sex while nine year olds look on masturbating corn cobs.... good lord I didnt need to see that.    The casting is horrible. If I never see Kandyse McClure again (in the Linda Hamilton role) it will be to soon. She ruins the first half of an already horrible film. Daniel Newman as Malachi and Preston Bailey as Isaac ruin the second half. Daniel looks like he is reading off cue cards while Preston is about as threatening as a kitten.    Oh and if that all was not a big enough F You to the audience, the monster never shows up at the end.     It isnt like the original Children of the Corn was Casablanca or something but good lord this is an embarrassment for all involved.

B002C6A6N6|4.0|This is an excellent series, and the DVDs are good quality. I'm just so disappointed that this set does not have closed captions or subtitles available, just as the previous complete series DVD set did not. Maybe when it comes to Blu Ray? Sigh...    But the series is very enjoyable.
0061438294|4.0|The book is good.  Some good information that usually is not discussed otherwise.  Good illustrations too.
0765316897|4.0|This has been a very interesting trilogy that has rekindled my interest in the fantasy genre.  Sanderson put together a fascinating world and the final book of this trilogy ties together all of the loose ends in a surprising yet satisfying way.  I am impressed at how all of the clues were spread throughout the books, yet it still ended differently than I though it would.  I like reading books that are not predictable as so many are.<br /><br />I also liked how the characters had some depth and went through what I thought were very realistic dilemmas and issues with leadership in difficult circumstances.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series to anyone.  It is a great introduction to the fantasy genre and shows off its potential to explore many profound issues.  It has something for philosophers, those interested in religion and many other issues.  I think that Sanderson has a great career ahead of him and I will be watching for his new novels as they come out.
B002XSP16A|5.0|Fantastic.   Really nice to hear this lady's angelic voice.  Reminds me so much of the late Eva Cassidy.  This is what music should sound like, not like the screeching voices you hear on some of today's stuff like Mariah where it sounds like a bus hitting it's brakes.    If you only buy one CD (or download) this year, Susan's the one!  Like Eva, I can listen to this over and over and never grow tired of it. :)
B0026P3G12|4.0|Okay, nice voice.  Highlights on the CD include:  \\"Wild Horses\\", of course \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" (though I liked the BGT one better), \\"You'll See\\" - should be released as a single.  As should \\"Who I Was Born to Be\\" and \\"Proud\\".  Go Girl!  Now, next time do what YOU want, not the producers.  Great 1st effort - live your dream and we'll share!!
B002Q4U9YU|4.0|Nothing really new in the CD except for the song \\"This is it\\" and the four demo selections (one is a poem) but I still enjoyed the music. The songs \\"Jam\\" and \\"They don't really care about us\\" are songs that you usually don't get when you buy MJ music collections but what can I say Mike is Mike and the songs are still good to hear. Also, after watching the movie, the songs are pretty much in the order they appeared in the movie. I guess that is what the CD is all about, a preview of the songs he was going to sing in the concert.     The pictures that went along with the CD are nothing to write home about but it is still his last photos performing so just for that reason alone they are classics.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|One of the best films of 2009. A must own for every Blu-Ray collection. Good action with great acting,  'nough said.
B0011XOBCI|5.0|This Crowley deck is essentially the same as the one listed on [...]; the same ISBN but a different box design. Having sold these cards for many years, I know that the Crowley deck is superior, both as art and as an intuitive tool.  One should not start with the Crowley deck, however. If you are new to tarot, start with the basic rider waite deck and  gain an understanding of the symbology and a solid comfort for reading. Crowley is abstractly rendered, in a sense--you intuit from context, color, movement, image as they appear to your cultivated feel for them.  They are glorious.<br /><br />And they are art-- many are on display in the London Museum, I believe. The strong colors and images are breathtaking. Even if you aren't a reader but an artist, psychologist, card collector, you'll want this masterpiece in your collection. If you are going to read the deck, invest in a thoth tarot book to guide you.
B001OQCV2O|5.0|Although it has the same plot of THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW it´'s a great movie!
B00005JN2Z|5.0|COLLATERAL, for my money, is one of the best films of the decade. Most modern films have a \\"sameness\\" about them. Regardless of genre, they all seem \\"the same\\". There tends to be too much focus on \\"wow-ing the moviegoer\\" with growing technology (CGI, special effects), gimmickry (tricky plots, flashbacks, surprise endings), and not enough focus on character development and dialogue. Another thing that I think a lot of today's movies lack is \\"realistic character interaction\\". Somehow, COLLATERAL overcomes all the cliches found in many modern films and rises to the level of poetry. Directed by the great filmmaker Michael Mann (THIEF, MANHUNTER, HEAT, THE INSIDER, and a personal shout-out to his groundbreaking 80s TV series MIAMI VICE), COLLATERAL is an absorbing, atmospheric, provocative tale of two men who meet at the literal crossroads of their lives.<br /><br />A mystery man named Vincent (played with 100% utter conviction and ease by the legendary Tom Cruise) arrives at LAX and \\"accidentally\\" bumps into another man, in which a briefcase exchange ensues. Vincent travels to downtown LA and gets in a cab driven by Max (Jamie Foxx in a performance that would earn him a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination). Vincent tasks Max to drive him around LA to complete his \\"errands\\". Max soon finds out (the hard way!) that Vincent is a contract killer. Vincent is going to kill 5 people that night and Max must drive him around or else!<br /><br />During this night, Vincent and Max learn valuable lessons about each other and themselves. In a series of stimulating conversations, some very truthful facts of life are laid out for the viewer to absorb and consider. One can see Vincent and Max literally transfer personality traits to each other as the night ensues, which leads to an inevitable conclusion. Every time I watch the film, I pick up on a detail or nuance about Vincent and Max I hadn't seen or noticed before and am amazed at how believable their interaction is and how meticulous a film that Michael Mann has constructed. This film ought to easily be considered one of the best of the decade.<br /><br />Within this fascinating film, Mann mixes in a great soundtrack, superbly staged and convincing action sequences, and beautiful cinematography of LA after dark. The excellent supporting cast includes Mark Ruffalo (as Det. Fanning hot on Vincent and Max's tail), Barry Shabaka Henley (as nightclub owner Daniel, who the men have an interesting encounter with), Irma P. Hall (as Max's mom, who almost steals the movie!), Javier Bardem (in a pitch perfect scene as the big bad guy Felix), and last but not least an incredibly vibrant and sexy Jada Pinkett Smith (as an early fare of Max's who ends up being a key to the story).<br /><br />I cannot stress or say enough of how impressed I was with Tom Cruise's amazing work in this film. It is as much a physical performance as it is a verbal one. And he handles both sides with aplomb. How he did not get nominated for an Oscar (Best Actor) is beyond belief! I would have settled for him getting a \\"nomination\\", but, I swear, everytime I watch this flawless film, I continue to believe that this is THE performance that Mr. Cruise should always be remembered for, leaving all his other great work in the dust! This may be the best performance of his career, and it is thankfully part of a truly great film.<br /><br />I own this 2-disc set dvd and it is perfect, the way every dvd of a big film should be with great quality on the film dvd and interesting, refreshing commentary on the 2nd one. A masterpiece as far as I'm concerned!
B0000508U6|1.0|Colplay is probably the best music you've ever heard if you never listened to another band's CD.  All four musicians wrote all of the tracks.  These brilliant songwriters have penned this stunning lyric on \\"Shiver,\\" \\"So I look in your direction, but you pay me no attention; I know you don't listen to me because you see straight through me.\\"  \\"How do you live as a fugitive?\\" Coldplay sings on the complex \\"Spies,\\" \\"I awake to see that no one is free.\\"  One excellent aspect of Coldplay is that their guitars are well-tuned.  On the moody \\"Sparks,\\" \\"I say ohhhhhhh\\" is the original lyric.  It's copyrighted; so don't try to steal it.  \\"Yellow\\" thunders for twenty seconds before giving way the pretty chorus where the singer's voice breaks momentarily into the upper register, \\"You know I love you so.\\"  The title track is less than a minute.  To toy with your mind, the song \\"High Speed\\" creeps along \\"before my head starts to explode.\\"  Coldplay's biggest problem is that they write their own songs which aren't very interesting and don't say much.  You have to give credit to them for selling a lot of CDs including the two in my collection.  I bought mine used.  Taxi!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Saw it in the theater and was a bit let down. Then saw it again on DVD and thought it was pretty great. Depressing but great.
B000069AUI|2.0|Friends had repeatedly told me that I would like Coldplay.  So I picked up this and \\"Parachutes\\" at a budget price.  I've played each a few times now, but have failed to connect with the band.  I like music that makes me feel something, connects with my emotions.  For example, \\"God Put A Smile Upon Your Face\\" just seems to drone on with the pounding piano, but it doesn't make me feel much.  Perhaps I don't connect with the lead singer.  I like the style of the music.  \\"The Scientist\\" is supposed to be one of their best songs, but the vocals seem sterile to me.  I feel nothing when the singer croons, \\"Nobody said it was easy; it's such a shame for us to part.\\"  It should be a heartbreak, but it's merely pleasant.  \\"Clocks\\" is a bright spot, an interesting track, \\"I am a part of your disease.\\"  \\"Daylight\\" sounds a bit like the Beatles' \\"Within You, Without You\\" from \\"Sgt. Peppers\\" mixed with the Beach Boys, but seems repetitive as all the lyricist can come up with is \\"slowly breaking through the daylight\\" that gets sung about 25 times in repetition.  I suppose it's supposed to be profound more than redundant.  You can listen to a few bars of \\"Whisper\\" and turn the track off, because they're just going to do the same thing over & over.  \\"Amsterdam\\" is a wonderful place.  I like the song Janis Ian wrote about it better than this one.  The singer croons on the sad track, \\"I swear I waited and waited to get out of this hole.\\"  Unfortunately, he doesn't.  Solve Sundsbo's cover artwork is very nice.  Perhaps.
0439813786|5.0|My daughter and all the kids in her class (age 9-10) can't get enough of this book.  She was so excited when her name came up on the school library list that it was her turn.  I'm not sure if it's the pictures, the book is easy to read or because it is very thick that attracts them to it over and over again, to the point of requesting it for a Christmas gift.  I have read the book, it's different.  I didn't think it was a great story but it was okay.  It's well worth the money to purchase though especially if it gets a kid so excited about reading a book!
B00003CWTI|5.0|This is an excellent movie which takes you on a kaleidoscopical and rhythmical journey of lives. Without ruining anything, there were some aspects of this film which seemed to have proselytistic qualities that differ in strict word from my own beliefs, but in spirit the film felt emotionally in line with me. I've always liked it. The acting is excellent. The soundtrack is excellent. The film as art is top.
0385504225|5.0|When it comes to writing spellbing page turners, I put Brown on the same level as one of my other favorite authors--Sidney Sheldon. For Brown's latest book, I think it's best not to give away plot details.   The reader should enjoy them first hand, and not become aware of them in a synopsis--Let Brown himself unfold his extraordinary story his way.  But know this, you are in for a wild ride with unexpected twists and turns...  Is this book as great as DaVinci Code?  I'd have to honestly say no...but it comes very close!  Readers will not be disappointed with Brown's latest literary offering.    Another page turner (for the Holiday): [[ASIN:0757300537 Christmas Gifts, Christmas Voices: A Holiday Novel of Hope and Healing]] I could not put this book down!
B000B8QG4A|5.0|Full of suspense, music, song, dance, dogs, cats, great food, heroes, villains, and romance, this one is a winner. If you're looking for a gift, and it's not currently being sold, find it used. It's worth it. If you can only find a used copy, and don't want to get someone a \\"used\\" gift, you can always get the used version as a topper or extra gift to accompany something else.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|I am neither a trekkie or Sci-Fi obsessed, that said I think this is a very very nice reboot, In much the same way as \\"Casino Royale\\" for Bond and \\"Batman Begins\\" was for Batman. The past references to pull the movie together was a nice touch such as the \\"Kobayashi Maru\\" test.    I think the \\"back in time\\" plotline was a little unimaginitive and I didn't get the whole Spock/Uhuru plotline.  Nevertheless I did enjoy the movie
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Both of the boxed sets are in limited supply in Australia. I ordered the mono box from Amazon and it arrived in eleven days (quite quick given how far Australia is from the US).  I purchased most of the stereo 2009 remasters individually, but the mono albums are only available in the box set. To me Sgt. Pepper is the most improved in mono. `Revolver' is greatly improved as well as Magical Mystery Tour (the 1987 CD release is one of the more disappointing mixes I have heard). There is something about the 1987 CD stereo editions I have always thought was `not quite right' but when I think about it now, having the bass and drums in one speaker and the guitars in the other draws attention to the fact that the audio engineers at EMI were still working out how to present the sound in a stereo spectrum. As other reviewers have said, the Beatles worked in mono when they were producing the final mix. But it has surprised me how different the mono mixes sound compared to the stereo mixes which I was used to. However I am not sure the casual listener would notice the difference. But I prefer having the uniform sound from both speakers (mono). For Ipod listening, I think the mono sound is much better. On a stereo or with 5.1 system both the stereo and mono mixes are very good: excellent in fact. The mono mixes are still quite `spatial' (for want of a better term) with plenty of separation.  If you can afford both boxes, get them, but I would suggest buying the mono box and then purchasing `Let It Be',  `Abbey Road' and `Yellow Submarine' so that way you will have all the albums.
B002T9H2LA|4.0|Looking at the holocaust and world war 2, some directors make movies like Saving private ryan or the band of brothers or a Midnight clear etc... My guy makes 'Inglourious Basterds'. Enough has been said about the greatness of this movie and its quality, this is Tarantino film-making at its element and oh by the way Christoph Waltz was terrific. having said that, although the character and persona of Aldo Raine was incredible, somehow Brad Pitt playing that was a bit of a let down, they should have gone with a different actor (all you brangelina fans, pl. note: i said different, not better!)<br /><br />Overall, there were a few weak points in the script and somehow the whole spaghetti western soundtrack was starting to get to me a bit, but all can be forgiven i guess. I'd rate this movie 4 stars and imo a keeper in my collection.<br /><br />Now..... if he'd make a movie focussing only on the origin and further exploits of the Basterds. That would be the best!
0810995212|4.0|On the recommendation of my advisor my senior year in high school (in 1961, that is), I took Art History as what was called a \\"rounding elective.\\" I confess, I never developed much of a feel for people like Titan and Van Gogh, and the Mona Lisa simply left me cold. Their art seemed too theoretical, too abstract in the intellectual sense. \\"What's it for?\\" I would think to myself, and then feel guilty of philistinism. But then I began spending occasional Saturday afternoons trolling through the dim basements of a couple of used bookstores downtown, uncovering Victorian novels and ancient college yearbooks, . . . and piles of old issues of THE SATURDAY EVENING POST and COLLIER'S and HARPER'S, many of them with cover art and advertising spreads and story illustrations by Norman Rockwell and Coles Phillips and Christy Chandler and N. C. Wyeth and Maxfield Parrish and J. C. Leyendecker. Their treatment of a subject was generally crisp, what was later called Imagist, because the company paying the bill for advertising wants to be sure the customer sees what he's meant to see. Everyone has heard of Rockwell, but in fact he modeled himself closely on the older Leyendecker, even moving to New Rochelle to be physically near his studio. (Unfortunately, Rockwell was much more aggressive and competitive than his model and Leyendecker soon lost a number of his best clients to him.) Joe Leyendecker was in many ways the king of the Golden Age of Illustration, which ran from roughly the turn of the 20th century with Charles Dana Gibson to the beginning of World War II. He created in his commercial art not only the \\"Arrow Collar Man\\" (the model for whom was his longtime lover, Charles Beach) but many of the icons of our popular culture -- the New Year's baby with top hat and sash, the giving of flowers on Mother's Day, the close association between Thanksgiving and college football. This lavish volume will take you through all that with reproductions of every cover he ever did and (while there have been criticisms of the accuracy of the text) you'll also learn something about his private life and how it affected his art.ile there have been criticisms of the accuracy of the text) you'll also learn something about his private life and how it affected his art.
1400031354|5.0|Book came quickly and in good shape, as advertised.  Will order again from this site.
0439813786|5.0|We picked this book for our 4th grader's book report.  Little did we know what a masterpiece we had in hand.  Our 9 year old got most of the story and of course us, as adults, got so much more.  Even our first grader loved hearing the story and seeing the pictures.  This book is truly a work of art for all ages. 6 years olds to 99 year olds will all get something out of it.  We loved how the pictures told part of the story, and the written text picked up where the pictures left off.  There is tons of symbolism and metaphors.  If we were in college, we would see how this book could, by itself, become the subject of an essay.  Or perhaps it's own course.      Family and friendship themes run throughout.  As does finding yourself when you think you have lost all that ever matters to you.      This is one of those heart warming stories that will affect anyone who reads it.  It is truly a gift to pass on to future generations.    Please read it.  You will not be disappointed!
B002NWRMVS|5.0|After listening and listening to Miss Jones, I've come to the conclusion that her talents are endless at first listen I was a little dissappointed cause I was stuck on what I thought I knew Nora Jones music was suppose to be. But after giving \\"The Fall\\" another chance. I found myself liking her new direction. I'm still her biggest fan.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I found this album to be beautifully done and have listened to it already several times. I love hearing her religious songs and Christmas song but agree with another reviewer that perhaps they should be on a separate album. I think the harsh criticism by a number of reviewers to be unkind and pretentious. For a first album it is a treat.
0140277447|3.0|So much has been said about this book by other reviewers already - so there is not much more that I can add. This is an important book but it is flawed. The information that Chang presents is derived from contemporary news reports, personal diaries and letters, and eyewitness accounts (some corroborated, others not). Therein lies part of the problem. Doubtless newspaper editors and reporters were as prone to bias then as they obviously are today. Eyewitness evidence is notoriously unreliable (unless backed up by independent corroboration - ask anyone in law enforcement). Clearly, however, something horrific happened in Nanking yet the extent of the carnage and the motives and culpability of those responsible remain shrouded in mystery and secrecy. Chang's book, however, is essentially a catalogue of inhumanity. There is little attempt at a sobre chronological account of events or to determine the historical/military antecedents of the Nanking campaign. The greatest flaw is the distinctly one-sided account of the massacre. There is almost no Japanese perspective offered, which effectively eliminates the academic value of this work. This is where the input from a trained historian would have been invaluable. The most surprising aspect of this book is that it needed a journalist rather than an historian to write a mainstream account in the first place. The end result reads as a profoundly depressing litany of man's inhumanity to (wo)man. It is now up to the Japanese historians to produce a definitive account of their actions using official records.
0786868724|4.0|If the rumor comes along that Mitch Albom is coming out with something else, I'm looking for it. That's because he always has something to say that will capture the attention of lots of people. And now, wouldn't you know it, Albom talks about a new dilemma in life. The dilemma of what exactly to say. Now, where did he come up with that idea? Read on!<br /><br />Albert Lewis was in Mitch Albom's life. And in life, he was known as Reb, better known as Mitch's Rabbi. And he had a request. The request was for Mitch Albom to deliver a eulogy on Albert Lewis. And to say the least, this bestselling author doesn't exactly feel worthy to say something on behalf of his Rabbi. But he accepts. While you think about that, Albom also gets to know a Pastor near the area where he lives. And Henry, at one point in his life, was nothing short of scum. And with a hole in the roof of his church, a changed man, God now has him where He wants him to be.<br /><br />While this is all going on, Mitch is getting to know these two men as human beings. Who Reb used to be, what he considers treasure, what he takes pride in. He learns through members of Henry's church, just how far he has come, and how much Henry means to the people of a church with a hole in the roof. So, of course, you can expect that Heaven will be a conversation discussed. Who's God is more right may even be addressed. Even the simple question, why do bad things happen to good people.<br /><br />In the end, I simply appreciated Albom for his willingness to share a story. And a chunk of his life in this story in particular. Some people will love this more than ever, while others might chalk it up as Albom brownie points, which they can think if they so choose. It got the good attention of T.D. Jakes, Bob Dole and Cokie Roberts. That's pretty awesome. Not exactly the same people in one sentence, but people just the same. And this person can't wait for the next offering of Mitch Albom! I like it when people use both head and heart.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I saw this Beatles Love Cirque show at the Mirage Theater and absolutely loved it.  I recently received this album as well as the documentary as gifts and I love both as a remembrance of the show and as a celebration of the Beatles music as well.   From reading some of the reviews I think some folks are not getting that this is a soundtrack to a live show, not just a new compilation of previous work.  While it's not necessary to have seen the Love show to appreciate this album, it does help place it context.    If you have the opportunity to see or rent the accompanying documentary, [[ASIN:B0017QMRJS All Together Now: A Documentary Film]] you can see the time, work, and care that went into creating the Cirque Beatles show, it was a long arduous process!  Ringo and Paul were very involved, as were the families of George and John along with the brilliant George Martin--just imagine trying the make all of them happy.  Aside from the Beatles themselves, few knew or understood their music as well as George Martin and his input, along with that of his son Giles, on this soundtrack was invaluable.  Just as he guided most of the Beatles albums, his sure hand shows here as well.    In the end, it's not like any of them need the money, they knew this was a way to introduce their music to folks who might think the Beatles was just that group their parents listened to, people who maybe don't understand that there were once actually musicians who composed their own music, wrote their own lyrics, did their own arrangements, played their own instruments, recorded on 4 tracks instead of 75, and played live concerts without lip-syncing.  Yes, Virginia, such a creature once existed! <g>    Be aware, the DVD on this package is NOT the video documentary-that's sold separately.    The DVD here is 5.1 audio disc for enhanced music systems.  I play it on my Home Theater sound system at home and it sounds fantastic, truly amazing you can hear all nuanaces you just can't hear on your car stereo.    However, if you don't want or need this, just buy the cheaper single CD that is also sold on Amazon that's playable on any CD player.  [[ASIN:B000JK8OYU Love]]    But back to the soundtrack, in the end, I found this to be celebration of Beatles's music, just as the show is.  I personally loved the way the music is woven together here.  Yes, I have all my Beatles albums and this soundtrack certainly doesn't take the place of those, but it does augment them.  Hearing the music in different context than the original albums, enhances, rather than detract from the enjoyment.    The sound is impeccable, and the song choices from all points of the Beatles albums and anthology are interesting, and all of the beatles are represented, not just McCartney and Lennon.  For example, the vocal from My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" is from a demo recording of Harrisons (found on the anthology) that had a more emotional tenor to it than the cut that finally ended up on the album.    Martin conducted the music to lay behind the original vocal and the end result is stunning and emotional.  The way the many songs and snippets of music are interwoven is beautiful.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Where can you purchase a CD for $9.99 nowadays?  Susan Boyle sings 12 classic songs that not are truly inspirational!  I love this CD!  She even sings Silent Night which is great for the holidays, if that is something you enjoy.  My favorites are \\"I Dream a Dream\\" and \\"Wild Horses\\".
B0015DROBO|1.0|Misled and annoyed that the text-to-speech feature disabled! Big part of why I bought the Kindle and how I expected to get through this book.  Rip off and I blame the publisher and Amazon.
B0013FSL3E|1.0|This was a complete disappointment! Having bought previous Disney/Pixar movies in the past, I bought this last Xmas without knowing what a complete waste of money it was going to be!!! I completely enjoyed titles like Nemo, Incredibles, Bugs Life, etc. and hoped that this would be as enjoyable. I WAS WRONG!!!! If you like watching a Robot trash compacter run around the planet picking up trash, and you think that the rave rievews from the so called experts must be right, then this is the movie for you!! No talking, very little plot, this couldn't even keep my four year old niece's attention for longer than a minute!!!! Save your money!!!! If not you could always resell the item if you have an account on Amazon or other competitors website!!!!
0307716988|5.0|I loved this book! Once I started reading I could not put it down. I could hear Michaels voice in every word. You get to know that he was a highly intelligent and sensitive person. He was a visionary and felt deeply for the problems of the world. This is a must read for any wanting to know him better. There will never be anyone like him again. He will be truly missed.
B000000OUJ|5.0|If you never heard of this one, then just leave, and look up some michael jackson beats. This is the real deal. Everything from the album art to the lyrics to the beats is raw. Still sounds much better than todays music. I still roll hard, down the streets with my 2000 watts of raw power, bumping this album. When I first heard this, I was 13 years old. Now at 29 this is still on top of all my Hop-Hop collection. Not one album has come close to satisfing my brain like this one can! Stay Real.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I purchased my Susan Boyle I dreamed a Dream here on Amazon.   She has such a lovely and different kind of voice, that anyone at any age would enjoy this.  I love the way she sings Wild Horses, I dreamed a Dream and Cry me a River. I had heard her sing the latter about 12-15 years ago on a CD of different regularr people. I was never able to find out her name or the name of the CD. It was out of London. When I heard her sing on the British American Idol, I got chills all over and recognized her voice. I later found the song on the internet.  I knew then it was she I had heard so many years before.  All the songs are priceless. She sings with such an innocent and pure style, that it brings tears to my eyes. Her Amazing Grace and Silent Night are so emotional that it seems she is also crying.  I can hardly wait for her next CD. I think Simon Cowell has dollar signs permanently imprinted in his eyes with this lady.  She is so unspoiled and honest. I wish her all the best the world has to offer. She is just amazing.  I recommend this CD and any other she will be releasing in the future.
B002XS4CYM|4.0|This episode is good but not great. Julias mother returns and is out to make her life misrable again, this time by challenging Julias custody of her children. Mike and Kimbers relationship gets rocky, Matt goes to jail, Shawn learns of his dead wifes past and Christian operates on a transgender person after bedding her. I dont mean to spoil the whole episode but theiir it is. If you are a regular to the series you should see this episode. Nothing truly climatic happens but Im sure that its building up to something. Thank you and have \\"a perfect life\\".
B00004RF8J|5.0|Thank you for the prompt delivery of my DVD and book.  Both were packaged very well.  I bought the \\"Little Shop of Horrors\\" for my niece because she really enjoyed the stage production at the Hale Theater in Orem, UT.  So happy that you had it in stock....
B0025KVLU6|5.0|Most people owning this 30-song collection know the basic history behind it. What people may not necessarily be aware of are subtleties that make this particular and most recent edition differ from the preceding versions. As mentioned before by other reviewers, McCartney's bass sounds sharp, pronounced and impressive. There's a rather tricky (also impressive) sounding drum part in \\"Dear Prudence\\" that I never really even acknowledged until I heard it on this remastered version. The vocals for the chorus in \\"I'm So Tired\\" are a bit more separated and, up until I heard this version, I always thought it was a single John voice performing it. Guitar bits throughout \\"Yer Blues\\", subtle sounds and vocal parts not heard in previously issued versions of this album, as well as a more-present harmonium in \\"Cry Baby Cry\\" and an absolutely HUGE sounding orchestra in \\"Good Night\\" are just some of the features of this new edition of \\"The White Album\\" that make it stand out from the other previously issued versions. The music will always be absolutely fantastic and stand out on its own, but the clarity and incredible sound quality overall make this an essential (and worthy) purchase.
031606792X|4.0|I have to say that I liked the book and where the author went with the story. I read it quickly as I couldn't put it down and felt pulled into the story. For me, I found this the best book of the series as this was the only time I felt that I couldn't put the book down. I found the story well written, easy to follow and gripping to the end. I liked where the author took Bella and Edward as well as the other characters and the way the story was told all the way to the end. I am a Jacob fan and was happy to see where she took his character and the balance in the book she gave to him and his story. Of course, there were questionable and unbelieveable ideas in the story...there were in the other books as well. Those things didn't deter me from enjoying the book. I had heard that there was controversy brewing and fans that didn't like the book. I am surprised that some people chose to not finish the book and I believe that for them, that is a loss...how can you judge a book without finishing it? For me, it is a fictional story about vampires and werewolves so why be surprised where that storyline takes you?
B0012GMYUU|5.0|Jeff Beck was Hendrix's favorite guitarist. Mine too. Just listen to \\"I'm Not Talking\\" from the first Yardbirds album.  But while most of the greats from the sixties have never recaptured the greatness of those years, this is Beck's best ever. Amazing!
0385341008|5.0|I was drawn to this book from the start from it's quirky title, rave reviews and the knowledge that it was an epistolary novel. I adore books like this that are told in letters. This book is reminiscent of 84 Charring Cross Road to me. It was a charming book that described events in a fictional way during a most horrific time in our history during the Nazi occupations of WWII. Despite the atrocities that occurred during the occupation of this island there is redemption by love and life that continues to go on and survives and thrives. The characters were enchanting and I fell in love with them as did Juliet. While reading this book, I found there were times of sadness , grief and tears as well as times of laugh out loud humor in the journey that the characters take you on. You'll have to read the book to find out why this literary society has their quirky name as I won't spoil it for you here! I highly recommend this wonderful novel, please grab a copy soon and enjoy the journey.

This is a nice 'old' classic for middle-agers and above to watch together (nothing here to keep the interest of children or teens).  Fine performances by Cary Grant, David Niven and Loretta Young.  It an enjoyable movie, though I find the ice-skating sequence too long and drawn out.
B002Y4KWS0|1.0|If your a SciFi fan this supposedly STARGATE series isn't worth your time.  Too much Soap Opera set in a Stargate like theme with little science fiction.  No aliens, not futurist Tech, not even much to do with the Stargate.  This series reads like it was written by a hormonal teenager and as such should be relegated to the Adult Entertainment section.  It is definitly NOT suitable for kids!
B00000AOUD|5.0|This had always been my least favorite Tull album, until now. I never bothered subjecting myself to a complete listen, having considered the parts I accidentally heard on the radio ridiculously overblown and just plain silly. As I learned yesterday - I'm a little slow - this was Ian Anderson's intent, the piece being a sendup of the \\"prog rock\\" leviathans of the era. The tipoff is in the very first line of the song, where Anderson sings the warning \\"Really don't mind if you sit this one out,\\" i.e., this is ridiculously overblown and silly garbage. Well, not quite. Yesterday I sat through the whole thing for the first time after reading online the satirical nature of the piece, and with my new ears I was astonished by the technical achievement, musicianship and melodies. The best part, though, was reading the laugh-out-loud lyrics as I listened - gems like \\"the wise man breaks wind and is gone while the fool with the hour-glass is cooking his goose and the nursery rhyme winds along.\\" Anderson follows the last line \\"Your wise men don't know how it feels to be thick as a brick\\" with a well-placed chuckle.
B002I6251G|5.0|This Editors album is a lot darker and more mysterious than their last album.  They tried something new and replaced a lot of the guitars with synth...but it sounds amazing.  As someone who is too young to have been able to experience Joy Division firsthand, this is the next best thing for me and is the sound that I have been looking for.  Each song takes a different, unexpected twist filled with brooding synth beats and Tom Smith's voice.
B0025KVLS8|5.0|'A Hard Day's Night' is the best of the Fab Four's first five albums. It captures the band at a crucial point in their early career; they've been around long enough to perfect their songwriting skills, but not long enough to have become tired and jaded by Beatlemania. As such, this album retains the carefree enthusiasm of 'Please Please Me' and 'With The Beatles', but displays a level of sophistication characteristic of 'Beatles For Sale' and 'Help!'. At this stage, their experimentation is modest, as they incorporate piano, 12 string guitar, and different percussion instruments such as claves.     The album is often noted for being the most buoyant and upbeat Beatles album, but I've never thought that was true. While the two massive hits in the title track and 'Can't Buy Me Love', plus a couple of other songs like 'I'm Happy Just To Dance With You' fit that bill, the rest of the album is more diverse. The McCartney compositions 'And I Love Her' and 'Things We Said Today' are great early examples of his ability to write wistful ballads, 'I'll Cry Instead' incorporates country influences, while the harmoica tinged 'I Should Have Known Better' hides its downbeat mood with a singalong chorus.     The most significant songs from a musical development point of view are the final two. 'You Can't Do That' is the first clear example of John Lennon's confessional style; he uses macho misogynism to disguise deep insecuity, fearing that others will laugh at him if they see his girl misbehaving. And the closer 'I'll Be Back' is a reflective minor key ballad that clearly looks forward to the Dylan-influenced 'Beatles For Sale' album.     In many ways, 'A Hard Day's Night' is first Beatles album I'd recommend new fans listen to. Its perfect pop hooks shows why The Beatles were the most popular band of their time, and its musical ambition shows why they would become the most respected. A truly great album.
1594488843|5.0|Daniel Pink's new book follows well in the tradition of \\"A Whole New Mind,\\" as he picks up on a new trend and explains it well. This time it's the apparent paradox of motivation - why do some people like Google pay their staff to regularly work on projects of their own choosing when they could be working hard on what they were hired to do?<br /><br />Pink shows that there has always been monetary motivation, but that has lost its attractiveness as we've moved from the \\"top-down\\" management system to the more heuristic style (workers being free to decide how to do their jobs). He points out that repetitive jobs lend themselves more to traditional rewards, whereas money doesn't seem to motivate innovation.<br /><br />I used to work for a major corporation (which we'll call \\"EMC,\\" because that is their name). Pretty much everyone I met had responsibility for something, to the degree that supervisors were enablers - you went to them and told them what to do. Supervisors could (and sometimes did) give you reasons why not, but they weren't about to come into your cubicle and micromanage you. And the wider your responsibility, the harder you worked.<br /><br />This system was totally unlike anything I'd come across before. Most businesses would act as though their employees couldn't be trusted. And although I was looking behind me nervously, I shone in this environment, and now I realized that's what they wanted from me.<br /><br />Pink mentions Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (if that's new to you, look it up on Wikipedia), and I think he is right that now that there's a relatively well-paid group of workers, they can ask for something more than basic salary. As Pink puts it, we need to feel that the work we do is worthwhile, and thus we move to the top of Maslow's pyramid and realize esteem and self-actualization.<br /><br />Hopefully you will have recognized some of the tenets of your organization. However, I think it's unlikely that all Pink's principles will have been adopted, so get this book now. It gives you a great deal to think about, and in the last section, Pink quotes people that have influenced his thinking.<br /><br />Whether you run a company or see yourself as \\"just an employee,\\" you need to read this. It shows pretty much everything to know about what will drive you or your staff to much better performance. It involves more than having an employee of the week, and you may find that if you work in a place that doesn't use these principles you may have to change jobs. But it will be worth it.u a great deal to think about, and in the last section, Pink quotes people that have influenced his thinking.

B000002HNR|1.0|I don't own this CD and chose not to, Only because of the review posted by the man who said to spend a few more dollars and get \\"In Concert\\" (If you take my advice... make sure it is a double disc and not the condensed single)<br /><br />I agree that \\"in Concert\\" is a by far better album to buy.  You only short yourself by picking this one.<br /><br />Everything said about how wonderful and rare tracks to be heard here are true. The author of that post is right on the money by praising this recording.  The only problem is that \\"In Concert\\" gives you every last bit of this and a little bit more.<br /><br />I love to see concerts but have to admit they tend to fall short of the studio voice.  I'm fine with that. Only reason I mention that is because after hearing this album or the other... I feel the studio versions of their music falls short.  Either album has to be the best \\"Live..feels like you are there\\" recordings.
B002X1ZEPA|3.0|I have always liked Rihanna's music. In particular her melancholy ballads of being in love and/or lost love. However, I think her camp used poor judgement going with the dark image and edge this album gives off, particularly after the ingfamous incident.  I only found 3 maybe 4 tracks that really showcased Rihanna's vocal ability the rest of the album was a forced attempt to come off as an hardened rocker chick and totally disconnected from the musical route she has had such success with.  I think an album that expressed hurt and pain, lost love, realizing its time to move-on, maturing and getting stronger after moving on, but, still being human and in love despite having to let go, would have been better message and approach particulary in deflecting the backlash Ri is currently getting for finally speaking out (the timing of which couldn't have been the worst).  Her vocals have certainly improved; however, it would have been better that she sang from her heart and not for the pockets of her record company. It's clear from the responses to this album that the pockets of the record company (and Rihanna's heart for that matter) might have been in better condition if a different approach to this album was taken. The team that handled this one should be fired immediately and sent on their way. I brought the album ($3.99 MP3 - Wouldn't have paid any more)to support her, but, for real.....I am confused by it and actually disappointed.

B002QEXN2K|5.0|I have liked John Mayer since I first heard him. I hadn't realized how truly talented he was until he began to play more blues guitar. I realize this is not like the last 2 albums but I really like it. It is pleasant, creative and smooth -- great to listen to in the car. I never understand why we, the public, expect recording artists to always write and play something like the last recording. A truly creative artist needs to change styles and express different parts of their personalities. So I don't get the lower reviews on this one. It is more like his earlier recordings but even better, as far as I am concerned. It is smoother and more defined in its expression. Heartfelt. But still put together with skill. I'd give it a 95 -- and only you old folks will relate to that one.

0061914177|4.0|Initially I wrote a pretty scathing review of this book. That mostly stemmed from the fact that within the book Gary constantly provides his email address and asks...no...begs for you to write him, promising a personal reply. He built an expectation and when I took the time to write him, asking whether he felt that his techniques would work in a retail sector that is mostly driven by price, he never responded. That neglect combined with his almost over-the-top delivery made me feel that the book, and Gary, were basically schtick.     Lo and behold, after my review was posted on Amazon, in comes an email from Gary. He apologized profusely for ignoring my email, again and again. One thing lead to another, and I ended up having a one hour chat session with him on topics ranging from our new baby daughters, our family businesses and eventually the lessons from the book. This guy is extremely busy (over 1500 emails per day!) and didn't need to give me any time. But he did, and that was much appreciated.     While I still feel that the basic tenets of the book can be found on any web marketing blog or web site, Gary changed my mind as to who he was as a person, and that makes the book resonate more profoundly. He's not just a loud-mouth sales guy with this crazy act. He really does care about the people who are taking the time to learn from him, and I believe the guy really does want to be an agent of change in the world (and I'm not just talking about the business world here). For instance, one of the things that Gary keeps driving home is that your family has to come first and foremost. So, you can \\"Crush It\\" in relation to business, your personal life, and in your relations with your family, etc. So, this goes way beyond just being a business book. I think this can be applied on a self help/holistic level for a lot of people as well.     So, I'd definitely check the book out. Gary has a unique voice that has resonated positively with a lot of people, but there probablywill be others who find his \\"yelling\\" to be annoying after awhile. I say, put that aside, get to the core message, and execute.

159562015X|2.0|A lot of people have complained that the book is no good without the code which allows you to take the online test.  I would say that the opposite is true.  The book is mildly interesting.  The online test is poorly designed.  You are better off guessing your talents than relying on the online test.  It is very disappointing that the users receives no additional information after taking the online test.  It just tells you your top five strengths, and reprints what is in the book.  It is not worth paying $20 bucks for the code and a chance to take the test online. Pick up a used copy, read through it in an hour, and you will get all the value this has to offer.
B0012QE4Q2|2.0|For those who give high ratings to 'The Other Boleyn Girl', I can only suggest that you either rent or buy the superb 1969 film, 'Anne of the Thousand Days'. Both films basically deal with the same subject but there's really no comparison. Where 'Anne' is a complex historical recreation and magisterial drama, 'The Other Boleyn...' is a ponderous soap opera, where numerous film-goers today have been taken in by the film's lavish production values (shot in High Definition), along with the three big name Hollywood stars who can't hold a candle to predecessors such as Richard Burton and Genevieve Bujold who really make you feel like you're watching flesh and blood human beings who lived in the 16th century.<br /><br />I haven't read the book which the movie was based on but I question why it was necessary to tell Anne Boleyn's story through the eyes of her older sister Mary (inaccurately depicted as the younger sister here in this film). Mary's part in 'Anne of the Thousand Days' is wisely depicted as brief and her bitterness toward her father for 'pimping her out' to King Henry VIII is much more believable than Scarlett Johansson's Mary who continues to hold a soft spot for the King despite being unceremoniously dumped by him and bearing a child who was dubbed a bastard. Mary is basically depicted as a saint who we're supposed to identify with because she has a 'good heart'. Unfortunately, most saints make for boring drama and Johansson's Mary is no exception. Johansson did well in Woody Allen's well-scripted 'Vicky Christina Barcelona' but she is completely out of her element in the 16th century. Instead of a world weary traveler in the Tudor court, Johansson's Mary is more like an Amish-like simpleton whose grim and ponderous expressions suggest that she is an actor of extremely limited range. Mary has little to do in 'The Other Boleyn Girl'. Her two big scenes (the love scene with King Henry and the birth of her son) are devoid of substantial dramatic conflict.<br /><br />What's worse is the suggestion that Anne and Mary were competitors for Henry's approval. In 'Anne of the Thousand Days', there was no competition between the two sisters. Mary's story was over when Anne comes on the scene. Genevieve Bujold defiantly states that she will never let the King do what he did to her sister and it takes a very long time in that film before Anne changes her mind. In The Other Boleyn Girl, Natalie Portman's Anne is a cold and calculating schemer from the beginning, inexplicably accusing her sister from taking the King from her. Later, she blames Mary for being responsible for the breakup of her secret union with Henry Percy. Ann's Uncle, the Duke of Northrop, orders that the two lovers separate. In 'Anne of the Thousand Days', the breakup is a matter of state policy. The head of the Catholic Church, Cardinal Wolsey, threatens Ann's lover and they're forced to part due to the King's designs on Anne. In 'The Other Boleyn Girl', Anne's undoing is attributed to what appears to be something like a bi-polar episode. After Henry rejects her because she can't bear a male heir, she becomes unhinged and ends up slapping him. In 'Anne of the Thousand Days', Anne is both the victim of Henry's cruelty and her own ambition to see her daughter declared the first in succession to the English throne.<br /><br />Screenwriter Peter Morgan's view of Henry VIII is way off the mark. Thanks to Morgan's superficial portrait, Eric Bana, turns Henry into a GQ model rather than the petty but complex Henry of history. For those who are offended that I dare suggest that Bana isn't right for the part, I strongly urge you to watch Richard Burton in 'Anne of the Thousand Days'; afterward, come back and tell me with a straight face that you think Bana was right for this part. What's missing in 'The Other Boleyn Girl' is how Henry relates to members of his Court. Who are his friends and confidants? And of course there's the whole political intrigue of the court whichis glossed over in 'The Other Boleyn Girl'. The key players, Cardinal Wolsey and the King's adviser, the deadly Thomas Cromwell, are missing. In 'Anne of the Thousand Days', there are a myriad of characters interacting with the King and as a result of these interactions, a full portrait of Henry's personality comes through. Here, Bana's Henry is dull and witless. What's more, Morgan's view of Henry and Anne's relationship has no real grace or drama. The best Morgan can come up with is a crude rape scene which reduces Henry to a comic book villain.<br /><br />'The Other Boleyn Girl' is not without a few good points. Ana Torrent is brilliant as Katherine of Aragon, depicting the quiet dignity of a woman terribly wronged. David Morrissey is credible as the steely social-climbing uncle who holds the strings in the family. Kristin Scott Thomas as the Boleyn mother acquits herself well but she's a bit too much of a feminist icon for 16 century England. Mark Rylance was much too ineffectual as Sir Thomas Boleyn but he looks very good as a 16th century nobleman.<br /><br />Production-wise, 'The Other Boleyn...' is filmed in sumptuous high definition and the scenes in the English countryside are a pleasure to watch. The camera work is for the most part pretty good with first-time director Justin Chardwick shooting scenes from a multiplicity of angles.<br /><br />In the end, 'The Other Boleyn Girl' is not the other Boleyn's Girl story. If you want the 'real McCoy', then you must see Richard Burton and Genevieve Bujold together. They are master craftsmen and you will be truly moved by their performances. The remake connects the dots but can never hold a candle to the 1969 production. Sometimes it's best to leave things well enough alone!Other Boleyn Girl'.

0307266303|5.0|I am no literary expert, but this book has to rank among the masterpieces of our time.  It's got story, plot, suspense, comedy, tragedy, and one gargantuan lesson for all of us.    It really is just the right amount of story telling like the mythical cast of characters pulled the plug on his laptop one day and demanded, \\"come on Chris, let's go for a run.\\"  There is a healthy dose of education but it's fascinating, compelling and, self evident.  McDougall taps the brakes in almost every chapter like he's saying, \\"wait for it...wait...\\" then 'kabloom!' you're discovering on your own new things about who you are.      Do you remember when you were young and running barefoot somehow seemed oddly natural but everything you've ever heard up until then told you to put on shoes or you'd get hurt?  Think of how you used to prance around barefoot light on your feet and how fast it felt.  Can you think of that form, high on the balls with your toes gripping every pebble?  Then later in life how your feet seemed to miraculously grow a size or two after you were supposed to be done growing.  Follow Chris on this journey and from this very humble reader I will tell you; your life will never be the same.  I promise.  Nearly everything you need to know about running begins and ends with this book but more importantly has been coded within you since you were born!    \\"Born to Run\\" cautiously leads you into a behemoth wilderness of unknown filled vigilant strangers, fierce competitors, and even life-threatening danger and guides you out hand in hand with a new, extended family of people who were Born to Run just like you.
B0000268M6|5.0|Ludovico Einaudi might be better known for his music when it's played at the BAFTA Television and Film Awards remembering those who passed away in the previous year. His music is light enough to allow dialogue but it's unforgettable and soothing those of us who mourns the losses. So this is my second compact disc by him and I'm not disappointed. I'm shocked that he's not more well known. This music would be ideal for Pilates and Yoga classes and I would highly recommend his music to be used in such places to allow comfort, peace, and a moment to reflect and de-stress from a stressful life. Anyway, his music is not for everybody. It's light but meaningful. It's ironic that I am writing about BAFTA here because it is what attraced me to Ludovico Einaudi's music in the first place. It has such a whimsical nature. His second track is worthy enough to relax you on the most stressed out days. His music has a calming and wonderful effect already. If you are looking for music to relax, regroup, and calm yourself, Ludovico Einaudi's piano tunes and performance is worth it.
B002MW50KO|5.0|Christmas in the Heart is just plain fun. If you want dreary serious Christmas music, it is not for you. However, if you are ready for a fun change of pace, this might just be the one you are looking for. It reminds me of the old LPs I listened to as a child, but with the cleverness of Bob Dylan. His voice is wonderfully weathered (as you would expect), and compliments the sweet voices of the accompanying vocalists marvelously. Our favorite on this recording is Must Be Santa. We laughed out loud with delight the first time we heard this one, and still wear enormous grins each time it comes around (and believe me, its a lot). Must Be Santa is a rip-roaring polka, with an accordian and modulations that keep the energy high. What a hoot!    I also am delighted that the proceeds of this album are to feed the hungry. With this album, you get a jewel, while you also give to our needy. What more do you want for Christmas?
B0026P3G12|5.0|We have all seen that clip of Susan Boyle, a frumpy old maid, from Blackburn, Scotland where she spent most of her years caring for her ill mother who passed away 2 years ago. Susan always had a voice and Britain's got talent was in Glasgow, Scotland and after a long day of uninspiring talent, she walks on stage in a frumpy dress and a terrible haircut. She's unemployed at 47 and volunteers at her church in her small village. She makes a few jokes and pokes fun about herself. She wants to be a singer like Elaine Paige who is best known for her roles in Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals. The judges like Simon Cowell, Piers Morgan, and a lovely attractive woman make silly faces. They are probably thinking \\"oh not another one.\\" They expect her to be bad. What they don't expect her to be is good and in fact, I think better than Elaine Paige at singing \\"I Dreamed a Dream,\\" from Les Miserables. Maybe it's because Susan finally gets her moment. Before she finished \\"IDream a Dream,\\" Simon's smirk on his face changes in total disbelief. She has made him and the crowd to be Susan Boyle converts. When you watch the video of Susan going on stage, nobody not even Ant or Des, the show's hosts, the judges, or the audience expected to witness television history or maybe a miracle in these times.     Susan Boyle's story is inspiring because there are so many of us out there who are just looking for a miracle and hope in a troubled world with a difficult economy where jobs are tough and hard to find, homes are being foreclosed, and insurance companies are getting away with murder. Susan's moment led her to London where she competed and came in second. But that's not bad. She got a record deal and is probably living a dream of a lifetime. She's one of the fascinating people of the year, 2009.    Susan is a nice girl who did all the right things. She went to church, sung in the choir, cared for her mother, and was devoted to her life in her small Scottish village. Overnight, she became a sensation. We have to allow her to have some flaws. Let her make some mistakes. She wasn't used to the press, the publicity, and being followed regularly. Now, she's better. She sang with her childhood idol, Donny Osmond, recently. Who knows what Susan's future will be? Right now, she's living a dream that few of us can only imagine. If it can happen for Susan Boyle, why not the rest of us. Like the song say, \\"I dreamed a dream so different from this hell I'm living.\\" I'll buy every compact disc. God Bless You, Susan, and keep singing.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Sound vibrates directly in us - creating, changing, molding. That's why music is so incredibly powerful, for healing as for pain.     Susan Boyle's soaring voice creates a truly pure, joyful space and for this I am deeply grateful to her. Thank you, Susan.
B0026CG3NI|4.0|It seems to be the appropriate title for this review. Kurt Vonnegut writes about his personal experiences in World War II as the Allies bombed the German city of Dresden which appeared safe. The narrator/author is Yon Yonson but it's really Kurt Vonnegut. Anyway, the book tells about the men who survived the bombing and their lives before and after. Billy Pilgrim barely escaped alive and was not of sound, mind, and body afterwards. He was haunted by his actions, his humiliation, and the inhumane conditions. He was also plagued by guilt. Billy's story could have made the book in itself. He married an overweight woman, Valencia who just wanted some man to love her and marry her. His life was plagued by tragedy as well. There were a few others but none stick so much out as Billy Pilgrim. Just because you survive, doesn't mean life will ever be the same again and it's not for Prisoners of War or anybody who lived through a war.
B002T45VX6|1.0|I ,like most,was eagerly waiting for this CDs release.I need to say,I am a firm believer in artistic growth...I understand not rehashing the same things over and over.Like any true artist ,you experiment,become bolder in your craft,expand and grow.When you become static...comfortable,you die .Some try TOO hard.I do not knock that,either.BUT,I have learned,if a CD  has to grow on you,you are giving the effort (or in this CDs case,LACK of!!!!)way too much credit.This is NOT LAUNDRY SERVICE,nor should it be.ORAL FIXATION,1 or 2,it is not.If her intent and desire was to do a 180 degree turn and create a uninspired Techno-dance mess,she very much succeeded.Bravo!!!Where I always thought Shakira excels in,over Britney and CLONES like her, is she is(or WAS)vocally talented,and writes,almost entirely, all of her own songs.She is ,added bonus, instrumentally talented.Point,she is as true and pure an artist as you CAN be.When did she decide she needed help?!In ANY of these areas!!!!This sort of @#$! died 25 plus years ago...mercifully ,for those  of us who lived through those DARK DAYS.Music,regrettably,now,is AMERICAN IDOL cookie cutter,excluding Kelly and Carrie.Now,I will try to recover what senses that were damaged by listening to this over priced coaster and remember Shakira back when she WAS an artist.Hate to add insult to injury,but,wish Amazon had zeroes.It would still be too kind a rating for this waste.

B001AQMBNC|4.0|Firstly, i gotta say WOW! i am constantly impressed with the re mastering of blu ray. most old films released for blu ray are are just touched up to a superb condition. The visuals of the screen are magnificent and this one is no different! Visually its just magnificent! if it wasn't for the Jeff Bridges looking so young, you could think it was a new film.<br /><br />Secondly, i saw this movie when i was 5 or 6, didn't like it... but aliens and no action made no sense to the eyes of a child :) NOW however, i love this film, and it is without a doubt Jeff Bridges best acting job!! the man is truly a gifted actor!<br /><br />I recommend this title for annyone who wants a great film, a different film, one that just stands out as one of the classic sci fi's

B001DUJNGS|5.0|I was fortunate enough to meet Michael Cretu and his pop-star wife Sandra in SF back in 1989, when she came to the US to promote her Virgin debut \\"Everlasting Love\\" and what an amazing day that was for me. I saw the limo pull up and of course Sandra was first out of the car, then out stepped Michael Cretu. I zoomed in on him as soon as he came in the store. We chatted for two hours about his productions and an upcoming album he was working on that was to be \\"something with gregorian chants\\". Little did I know, that was to be Enigma. He had not yet come up with the project name. It was a memory I will cherish for years to come.   If you like the female voice on the original Enigma albums, then try Sandra's Close to Seven\\" [[ASIN:B000M0ABH0 Close To Seven]]to start with. It was the release subsequent to the first Enigma CD and quite similar in production. Her other albums like \\"The Art of Love\\" [[ASIN:B000LXGRTO Art of Love]]and \\"The Wheel of Time\\" [[ASIN:B000063V2U Wheel of Time]]are winners too. Check them out.

I love noir and detective fiction so it sounded like it was right up my alley.<br />While reading the book I was engrossed and enjoying myself.  As a mental health professional, I found his \\"mental patient\\" dialogue unrealistic but generally short.<br />Fast pacing and unusual characters kept me turning pages.<br />When I got to the ending though I was just like \\"What?\\"<br />I feel he took the biggest cop out possible of a writer with the ending.

B002UPA4ZY|5.0|Being an Aussie fan of David Foster's music (since the \\"St. Elmo's Fire\\" days) I have followed his career as a musician, writer, producer, and arranger for nearly 25 years.  Following his knockout \\"Hitman\\" Concert, PBS Special, and ultimate CD/DVD release, I was so much hoping for a Christmas 2009 DVD release of a \\"David Foster and Friends\\" Concert Tour which has been underway since May this year.  Well, my wish has been granted with this soon to be released \\"Andrea Bocelli and David Foster - My Christmas\\" Concert from the Kodak Theater in Los Angeles, CA.  This concert dvd features the absolutely astounding David Foster and Andrea Bocelli (who always work beautifully together), along with extraordinarily special performances with Natalie Cole on the intimately arranged \\"The Christmas Song\\" and Reba McEntire on \\"Blue Christmas\\"; Mary J. Blige on the hauntingly beautiful arrangement of \\"What Child Is This\\"; and Katherine Jenkins on the operatically spellbinding \\"I Believe\\", all under the soaring orchestrations of William Ross.  Truly, this has \\"CLASSIC\\" stamped all over it.  If you are a lover of great holiday music, great musicians, great singers, and great orchestrators, this one's for you.
B002H3F7F6|3.0|I cannot decide if Sting is trying to sound like a grown up choir boy, a bad opera singer or a minstral!  His voice is just plain weird.

B000A6T1KE|1.0|The sheer face-palming stupidity of this movie is enough to make Insurrection seem even slightly reasonable.  At the very least, Star Trek Insurrection has the benefit of the doubt as to whether the bad guys stance of relocating the hippie-liberal people for medical breakthroughs could even work, as the medical miracle of the planet's atmosphere might be impossible to replicate, or impossible to distribute, or the hippie-liberal people would be willing to share it if only the wrinkly-faced bad guys would go away.<br /><br />\\"Star Trek Nemesis\\" has absolutely none of that.<br /><br />Nemesis probably had a special place in my heart somehow for being the first Star Trek movie I fully and completely remember seeing in theaters when it first came out.  I'm 70% sure I saw Insurrection in theaters, and 30% sure I saw First Contact in theaters.<br /><br />So maybe it had to take this long, or rather it had to take my maturing into an adult, and becoming a real Star Trek fan to realize the movie wasn't just a bust at the box office and franchise-killing, but was a complete mess of sheer stupidity!<br /><br />So the story is our guys pretty much have nothing to do but wait for another Borg attempt (unless Voyager ensured that wouldn't happen any time soon), and Commander Riker is about to go off with Deanna Troi on a honeymoon, then captain his own ship.  But then suddenly comes Shin-Zon, who stages a coup on the Romulan Senate and takes control of the Empire with the military's backing.<br /><br />For some reason, this is treated with a remarkable amount of hostility and uncertainty, despite the fact that the Federation and the Romulan Empire had been on hostile terms for many years, and that a sworn enemy of the Romulans had just taken over the Romulan Empire, and that this could lead to a great many new and interesting diplomatic developments between the two factions.<br /><br />Ideally it SHOULD be treated this way, but that would probably take too long, and have too much \\"exploring\\" and \\"negotiation\\" and \\"diplomacy\\" and \\"logic\\", all the things a Star Trek movie SHOULDN'T have, right?  Oh wait, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT STAR TREK IS ABOUT!  At least you'd think that from the Original Series and the movies.<br /><br />Instead, Shin-Zon is introduced and supposed to be someone to RIVAL KHAN NOONIEN SINGH in terms of sheer awe and power and evilness and such.  I have no idea of this is true, but I had heard that Rick Berman said that Shin-Zon would rival Khan, or even equal him.<br /><br />Rather than be a snotty pessimist, I will simply say that this is not possible because the writers did not even try to portray it this way, or else their attempts to do so ended up being edited out of the final script, or completely forgotten about.<br /><br />Shin-Zon is an artificial human created from Jean-Luc Picard's DNA by the Romulans.  They planned to have this clone created, rapidly aged, then inserted in Picard's place as captain of the Enterprise for some nefarious plan against the Federation.  Early on, this plan ends up being abandoned, and Shin-Zon is thrown away like garbage onto Remus, among the enslaved Remans.<br /><br />One of the Remans there takes Shin-Zon in, after seeing how he is horribly treated by the Romulan overseers.  Shin-Zon grows up in an environment of hatred of Romulans, hard work and torture.  Somehow he manages to gain ahold of much power and influence amongst the Remans, and stages a coup in which he assassinates the entire Romulan Senate, and gains power of the Empire with its military behind him.<br /><br />The vast majority of his story is over!  He can no longer be anywhere near Khan, because Khan's whole story was one that mirrored that of Captain Ahab in \\"Moby Dick\\"---a lust for revenge so overpowering, it destroyed him and everyone he held dear.  Shin-Zon achieves his revenge without losing anything, it seems.<br /><br />So here comes Jean-Luc Picard, his DNA twin, sent by the Federation to investigate, and evennegotiate if possible!  He can do what has never been done before for the Romulan Empire; make a peace treaty between the Federation and the Empire that can see them united, break down the Neutral Zone, and be a powerful and dominating force together in a strong alliance!<br /><br />Instead, because arbitrary action and \\"Anyone who isn't a part of the Enterprise and has spooky evil music play whenever they come on-screen must be a bad guy\\", Shin-Zon for ABSOLUTELY NO REASON AT ALL decides he has to attack and destroy Earth and the Federation.  Brbbrbrbrb, WHY?!?! WHY?!?!? WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY?!<br /><br />There is NO REASONING OR JUSTIFICATION AT ALL for Shin-Zon to arbitrarily ATTACK THE FEDERATION just because he's a clone of Jean-Luc Picard!  HE HATES THE ROMULANS!  EVERY SINGLE MAJOR PLOT POINT AND KEY IN HIS BACKGROUND POINTS TO HIM HATING THE ROMULANS!  AND SUDDENLY HE HATES THE FEDERATION, WHY?!<br /><br />This would be as if Khan, after marooning Kirk and taking the Genesis Project, decides to go and attack the Klingon homeworld.  WHY?!<br /><br />So instead of making any sense and maybe, trying to hunt down the military elements of Romulus that DIDN'T support him, or preparing to put down attempted rebellions on Romulan colonies and territories that oppose him, or maybe trying to make sure the military is pleased with him and strongly backing him, instead of THREATENING THE ONLY GUY WHO COULD POSSIBLY QUASH YOUR NEFARIOUS PLOTS with random acts of violence for even DARING TO QUESTION HIM, Shin-Zon decides to threaten the only guy who could put an end to his life and reign, and go after Earth because Earth is good and good is dumb.<br /><br />The rest is just fudge frosting on the cake of idiocy this movie takes.  This is a true franchise-killer, and while J.J. Abrams did good in \\"reviving\\" the franchise with \\"Star Trek\\", after this mess of a movie, anyone short of Uwe Boll could have revived the franchise.Romulan Empire; make a peace treaty between the Federation and the Empire that can see them united, break down the Neutral Zone, and be a powerful and dominating force together in a strong alliance!      Instead, because arbitrary action and \\"Anyone who isn't a part of the Enterprise and has spooky evil music play whenever they come on-screen must be a bad guy\\", Shin-Zon for ABSOLUTELY NO REASON AT ALL decides he has to attack and destroy Earth and the Federation.

So instead of making any sense and maybe, trying to hunt down the military elements of Romulus that DIDN'T support him, or preparing to put down attempted rebellions on Romulan colonies and territories that oppose him, or maybe trying to make sure the military is pleased with him and strongly backing him, instead of THREATENING THE ONLY GUY WHO COULD POSSIBLY QUASH YOUR NEFARIOUS PLOTS with random acts of violence for even DARING TO QUESTION HIM, Shin-Zon decides to threaten the only guy who could put an end to his life and reign, and go after Earth because Earth is good and good is dumb.      The rest is just fudge frosting on the cake of idiocy this movie takes.  This is a true franchise-killer, and while J.J. Abrams did good in \\"reviving\\" the franchise with \\"Star Trek\\", after this mess of a movie, anyone short of Uwe Boll could have revived the franchise.

B0013D8LCW|5.0|I put this DVD into my netflix list and it came. I popped it in one night and it was the most amazing, life altering, moving film, that I have seen in a long time. The film explores so many different avenues. It's not just a gay film. It shows a sense of family, following your dreams, doing what's right and being true to yourself. It doesn't have the stereotypical elements of a gay film AND it has a great ending. Not to mention that the soundtrack is SICK!! Shane Mack is amazing. I recommend the DVD and soundtrack.

0316066524|5.0|I've often heard this book described as \\"difficult.\\" Nonsense! It's long. It's complex. It's challenging. It covers lots of weighty subject matter. But it's also funny, intriguing, stimulating, and touching. Yes, I really meant \\"touching.\\" For all the talk about how Wallace plays games with the reader, sets up many unanswered questions, leads you through a narrative wild goose chase (all those things ARE true), the book is also stuffed with fully-drawn characters who really do hold our interest, and, yes, capture our concern. The book is drawn with lots of post-modern effects, but the story is driven by Wallace's humanism. It's not just a bunch of showing off. It's a great story, told in a masterfully experimental way. It's sad that we won't have Wallace around to write more like it.

B0026P3G12|3.0|Disappointing in that the orchestra generally overpowers her voice.  It is as if some director was worried that the voice might falter, so made sure there was a huge, lush orchestration on which she could rely.  My opinion:  her voice is powerful and sure.  Leave the orchestra at a normal BACKGROUND, and let the voice carry the day.  Also, she looks just lovely on the cover of the cd, so someone did a good job on something.
B00000064E|5.0|In a recent review, I called [[ASIN:B0000507XA Tape from California]] by Phil Ochs a classic for its inventive, barouqe treatment of folk. On the other side of the pond, England, around the same time, Nick Drake created another classic, Five Leaves Left.<br /><br />The similarities between Ochs and Drake are interesting. Both expaneded the guitar strumming scope of folk music with orcherstration, both suffered from depression--a much harder illness to treat in 1969. And both died young, Ochs from suicide and Drake from an accidental drug overdoese.<br /><br />But Drake was more musically subtle . He wrote about deeply personal issues, not the political and social ideas Ochs choose, and while Tape From California features hapsichords and huge scores, Drake used quiet and yes depressed string sections. Listen to \\"Riverman\\" to hear Drakes more pastoral approach.<br /><br />The quiet muted sound is from a quiet muted man. Drake often sings his Keatsian lyrics in a low tone, just above a whisper. You get the shy sadness of a broken young man in both the resignation of music and words.<br /><br />Drake is not trying to overcome his sadness, but rests in it, sitting still to witness whatever beauty he may be able to see and feel. His music indicates that was a lot, and there is a classical grace and vurnerability to all the songs. Through these he is able make you experiance his own sadness and resignation, and immediately, you connect with Five Leaves Left.<br /><br />Drake was also an excellent guitar player, and a lot of his songs have the impulse of celtic jazz. Backed by memebers of Pentangle and Fairport Convention, two of the best jazz-folk outfits in England then, these songs contain an expert ressonce that take them way beyond average folk.
B002MW50KO|4.0|I'm a huge Dylan fan but admit to cringing when I heard that Bob was going all elf on me. At the first listen, I didn't like it. The chorus singers seemed corny and there are some notes that, well, even by Dylan standards, were not hit. My 16-year-old son wanted to hear it. I thought he'd laugh his head off but he loved it. He found it different but warm and engaging. He made me listen to it 3 times straight through on a long drive and I don't know if it was Stockholm Syndrome or the music but I came to really like it. It's what we'll be playing as we decorate the tree this year.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|Doubt is not an easy film, which is what makes it work so well. The answers to the questions it poses are not readily evident<br /><br />In 1964, a young idealistic priest starts work at a New York Catholic boys school, which just enroled its first black student. The school is run by an old school nun, who favors discipline over nuturing. The priest and nun are played by Philip Seamour Hoffman and Marrel Streep. Amy Adams plays the younger teacher trying to bridge the two.<br /><br />Hoffman's charactor is accused of molesting the young black student. There is evidence to suggest he did, but evidence to suggest he did not. Both nun and priest bring their own biasis to their argument--they highly dislike one another on personal and politcal ground--so who you beleive depends may depend on who you agree with. If this sounds subjective, think of how Amy Adam's charactor felt when chosing sides. She is the kindest here and the only person with no clear agenda.<br /><br />This was right after Vatican II, which tried to update dogma in the Catholic Faith. Doubt is  also set during civil rights toumoil, and the indrodution of the pill. In 1964, the counterculture was not visable yet, but was budding. The film is about old vs. new, tradition vs. change, all the ambiguities surrounding this.<br /><br />You are probably more confused at the end of Doubt then when you began, but the challange this film lays before you is what films are supposed to and to rarely do now. It gets you thinking and discussing and debating, and that is more than enough.

B001FB562U|5.0|**WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD**       \\"The Road\\" is a powerful movie about the love of a man for his son. Viggo Mortensen's character is a simple man who shows unconditional affection for the boy he has vowed to protect. This emotional core is what sustains the film through times of absolute despair. The physical landscape is like a roadmap of purgatory: bridges have collapsed, mushrooms of smoke billow into the sky, earthquakes cleave fissures in the ground so trees snap and fall like matchsticks, and raging orange infernos consume woodlands, as if a glimpse of Hell is just beyond the horizon. Everything is grey and bleached of color, seen through a skein of ash. At times it seems as if you're watching black and white documentary footage; that's how stark and grainy this world is. All vibrancy and beauty have been scorched away by an apocalyptic cataclysm of global proportions.        The world has been stripped of all joy, like a corpse gnawed to the bone by rot. The only pleasure that remains is finding a hidden stash of food or the simple comfort of human contact. Hope is largely absent, so it must be manufactured.       The movie is permeated with doom. Never have I witnessed a story so bleak, and yet the dread is palpable. One cringes when the boy sits on a chair swing and it creaks, potentially drawing the attention of cannibals who lurk on the periphery like brutal phantoms to plunder survivors of their innocence. Viggo Mortensen is a coiled spring of single-minded determination: save the boy at all costs. This survivalist mentality has made him paranoid, which is realistic in a world where people have been reduced to predators. All he wants is to secure food, warmth, and shelter for his charge. The unforgiving landscape challenges him at every juncture.        The boy (Kodi McPhee) is in a state of fearful vigilance. His youth has allowed him to retain a strong sense of right and wrong in a world that has been leached of morals. He hasn't grown jaded yet, and doesn't want to. His generosity and kindness are probably what keep his father from descending into a vengeful, feral torpor. The boy is his conscience, reminding him of when people were civil with one another. It is a performance of amazing potency: several scenes are stunning in Kodi's ability to convey raw emotion. Even though acts of cruelty are commonplace, the boy fights for decency, making him instantly sympathetic. A part where the boy is stunned by a gunshot and goes catatonic while his father hauls him away and picks brain matter out of his hair is rendingly powerful.        The movie raises difficult questions. Would it be more noble to commit suicide than to succumb to the clutches of a stranger? Is trudging down a desolate road toward the unknown a better alternative than staying in one place? If one wants to survive at all costs, is it mandatory to become as grim and cruel as your surroundings? Or is showing compassion what ultimately separates humans from animals?       The end is a test in endurance. Death looms near. The boy has to make an impossible choice. He wanders down the gloomy shoreline and sees a man. Is he an apparition? A hallucination? A mental distillation of all his hopes and fears? Everything the boy craves appears on the beach: a man, a woman, two children, and a dog. Is this a vision brought on by malnutrition and fever? The woman bends down and caresses his cheek, saying, \\"I've been waiting for you\\". Is the boy actually lying next to his father, in a fetal position, fantasizing what he wishes would materialize? Is he willing himself to die? All I can say is that I was profoundly affected. All the hardships endured seemed to mean nothing on that tiny stretch of sand near a grey, frigid ocean. And yet it wasn't the destination that mattered, it was the road they travelled to get there.

B00008977N|5.0|The concert was amazing as I made it to this tour, but I have to give it a C- on Video quality or a 2 on the Star scale. That being said you need to look at how it was shot, dark, smokey what do you expect.  Plus I am sure they didn't have HD cams back then!! LOL  The addition of Paula Cole was very good addition as I think she sounds much better than Kate Bush. Overall a must have if your a Peter Gabriel fan, I review the music first and then the video in this case 5+++ stars on music, so so video quality as mentioned below.
B002VECM40|4.0|Twenty minutes into this film, I wasn't sure if I was going to like it at all. It was setting itself up as the \\"teacher helps an inner city kid\\" type of film, which has been overdone. I was very wrong. This is a film about a young girl with big dreams, and little else, as well as the ability to find and help yourself.<br /><br />Gabourey \\"Gabbie\\" Sidibe portrays Claireece \\"Precious\\" Jones, a teenager growing up in Harlem with an abusive mother, no father, learning disabilities, one child of her own, and one on the way. The viewer learns early on that this is NOT the feel-good movie of the year.<br /><br />Siddons is more than adequate in her role, but this movie, acting-wise, belongs to Monique. Her portrayal of Precious' mother invokes a wide range of emotions from the audience, and she was arguably the most memorable part of this movie. I will go on record as saying that Monique has probably locked up her Best Supporting Actress nomination for Oscar night, 2010.<br /><br />Gritty yet realistic, 'Precious' is a film that I think could be enjoyed by most adults. Despite its unnecessarily long title, I believe this movie has begun to find its audience, and I hope that it continues to do so.
0375714839|4.0|The Complete Persepolis contains Persepolis and Persepolis 2 in one volume. Although there is no indication where the second volume begins, there is a shift in the story. Persepolis is an autobiography in graphic novel. Marjane Satrapi grew up in Iran, and the book is as much a story of the Persian people and Iran's history as it is her own. It's a fascinating look at a country and its history, but it's most remarkable seen through the eyes of a child. It's incredibly moving to think and see how much geography plays into our own sense of self and autobiography.<br /><br />From a visual standpoint, Persepolis is simple and beautiful. There are frames so packed with meaning, I would stare at them for a few minutes. I would gladly hand several on my wall. It's an incredibly accessible graphic novel, as it's rather verbose, but Satrapi's drawings are powerful.<br /><br />Persepolis is clearly a powerful book, and I do believe it's an important book, particularly for Westerners. I think it's wonderful and smart, but I didn't quite love it. It moved me deeply, but there was some unknown element inhibiting my full personal enjoyment.

B001LRJH0U|4.0|I am a fan of western, in a different way than the most. I was born, raised and dreamt in a different culture, with a different language. However, Westrn was part of my young-adulthood reading. Although I enjoyed several spaghetti westerns, this western clicked somewhere deep within. Throughout the movie Viggo Mortensen managed to be on the sideline, in terms of action and such. The finishing cleans up the confusion a bit. The vindication of camaraderie could be a theme. However, I doubt it's that straight-forward. It was ultimately a good story, that can make any romantic very nostalgic. A part of my psyche cherishes that rugged life of wild-west, the chivalry, comradeship and such. It also connects me with the past memory of my feelings, [memory of feelings? go figure]--about my imagination of America, even before I was planning to come here. Within me, I always believed and carried a wild west. The way the man and his packhorse rode to the west, merging with the setting sun--lonely, but free, only companion are the horse and the dust of his trail, well, my soul yearns for it. The movie brough a part of that back.   Ed Harris and Vigo Mortensen--both acted well, so did Rene Zellweger. By the way, Rene Zellweger acted in a smilirly vulnerable role in another movie where her Jewish husband's brother bed her --result of her sexual frustration and loneliness. The movie does not have too much talking--and dialogues were meaningful, instead of being \\"filler-talks\\", cinematography is commendable, and I liked the soundtrack--the beats and instrumentation go well with the modern time. I think Ed Harris's greatest credit in this movie is to be able to use sound and dialogue to create a universal theme of friedship, romance, agression. greed, politics and sacrifice--in one nice amalgum. It seems the set was a small one. The make-up and costume seem great--especially the toguh, hardened look on both mai characters' faces.  I recommend the movie. Good show.

B000001ZS5|5.0|A true classic for synth lovers, not to be missed. The CD would be worth the cost of admission if it only contained the first several minutes of the first track. It overlays a somewhat dour and subtle line with a high energy set of lines that in combination is just brilliant. Sounds like something you might expect to hear in an out-of-body experience. The problem is that you can't hear the sample here. The sample for track 1 comes later in the track. So, just get it - and if the last track really ruins the experience for you, just re-burn the CD and leave it out, or leave it off your MP3 playlist.

I love Frank Warren and everything he has done.<br />Inside this book you will find the deepest secrets of strangers just like you, and if your lucky you might even find yourself in this book. The only reason I gave it four stars if because I feel like...people get much to caught up in reading postsecrets and often think those secrets are about them. For me, the first time I read it I felt so...Weighted down by all the secrets...Carrying them around for weeks and feeling deppressed even if they weren't my secrets to be deppressed about. So, I only advise you to read this if you have a good sense of Judgement and can tell the difference between reality and not reality. Take Caution, and enjoy it. It might just save your life &lt;3

0451450523|5.0|I've loved this story since I was a small child.  My first exposure to it was via the animated feature, done by the same group that animated The Hobbit.  I'm very pleased to have read the book and gotten more of the story.  It's a wondrous tale of searching for one's own magic, overcoming loneliness, and of a love that might have been... and the reclaiming of innocence.
B000ZECQ08|4.0|i completely and inequivocally agree with  z hayes (plano,texas)  on every aspect that she touched on.  Book 6 in the Harry Potter series was my absolute favorite and the movie just did not do it justice.  it was a decent movie if you've seen all the movies but never read the books however, if you've read the books it would be hard, if not impossible, to give this movie 5 stars.  really, im stretching it to give it four.  the added scenes add nothing to the movie and most of the scenes from the book that werent in the movie were vitally important to the plot and progression of the characters and story.  im not going to give anything away, i just need to say that the movie was a disappointment.  the characters are amazing in that the actors portraying them portray them perfectly and with the necessary depth.  my only hope for the final 2 movies is that the directly sticks to the book and doesn't go on about adding more unnecessary and meaningless scenes.  given that the final book is in two installments there is no reason not to lay it all out there and just really go for it.  more action, more depth, more special effects, more everything.  for those of us that have been following the series through 7 books and 6 movies i think it is vitally important to give us what we've been waiting for.  if i may say so, we arent looking for the directors interpretation of what the book should have been, we are looking for exactly what the book was laid out on screen in all its glory from start to finish.  for me, the whole point of the movie adaptations lays in the success of this last one and by success i mean accuracy, depth, and wow factor.  i want to leave the theater feeling like it was all worth it and in this one i really just didn't and that's not even including the disappointment and irritation that stemmed from the fact that my favorite book was a let down on screen.
B002LCOQQO|4.0|I purchased a couple of these new remasters out of curiosity; I read some good reviews and some mixed ones. I already owned these original CDs, and previously the LPs. Computer World sounds very different from the original CD, and definitely worse. While the original is a bit thin sounding, the new one goes completely in the other direction, pumping up the bass, and rolling off the high end unnecessarily. Not terrible by any means, but not good either. That said, the booklet is beautiful, and the packaging overall makes me want to keep it.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|\\"Up\\" by Pixar continues the amazing run of animated movies this studio has put out.  Just when you think it will be impossible for Pixar to top themselves, they amaze you by surpassing their already lofty standards.  I thought the only slight stumble from Pixar was \\"Ratatouille\\", but then they release \\"Wall*E\\" and \\"Up\\".  \\"Up\\" may be the best animated film I've ever seen and is about as perfect an animated film as can be made.  Every aspect of \\"Up\\" is first-rate -- a wonderful story, incredible animation, great casting (yes, voice casting is critical and Ed Asner is wonderful) and a movie that delivers across a range of emotions that connect with adults and children.  I won't bother recapping the plot, plenty other have done that.<br /><br />We have 3 children (5,7 & 10) and they all are equally mesmerized and entertained by this movie.  We all loved the movie when we saw it in the theaters and the Blu-ray version of \\"Up\\" does complete justice to the picture.  Watching this movie on a 52\\" HDTV at home, while not up to theater standards, certainly is about as close to being in the theater as you can get.<br /><br />Storytelling is an art form and we often take for granted how hard it is to create truly wonderful stories.  The folks at Pixar have spoiled us by making it appear too easy, constantly churning out movies that will be classics for generations, just like the old Disney animated movies.  If you have not seen \\"Up\\", do yourself a favor and buy a blu-ray player, or if you have one, then buy the blu-ray version of \\"Up\\" and treat yourself to a wonderful, hynotic and mesmerizing bit of storytelling.  It just doesn't get any better than this.
0375842209|5.0|I was a little skeptical about reading a book from the point of view from death, but it was a very easy read and an astonishing story about a young girl in Germany during World War 2.
B001OQCV24|3.0|When I thought about all the hoopla that surrounded the release of this film, I figured that the film would delve into the Mayan culture (which predicts the now-infamous world-ending date) and how people of the Earth would interpret in during that fateful year.  Instead, I got a disaster film...nothing more.<br /><br />Of course, if you a fan of the \\"disaster film\\" genre, then this may be one of the best films you see all year.  The special effects are incredible, and action is non-stop, and a few scenes (like the crumbling of the Christ The Redeemer statue in Brazil) that are iconic.  It compares favorable to other movies of its type, including \\"Titanic\\" and \\"Cloverfield\\".<br /><br />Where this film falls short of those films, though, is that fact that its appeal ends at \\"disaster\\".  The characters (at least the main ones) are almost blatantly ripped off from \\"War of the Worlds\\" (the Tom Cruise version) in terms of family dynamics, and by the end of the film you still don't find yourself really rooting for them with any heartfelt emotion.  Also, what little semblance of a plot that does exist moves by way too quickly, with no time devoted to fleshing them out or making them truly crucial to the story.  As I mentioned earlier, this movie sorely lacked any sort of discussion about why the Mayans predict the world to end in 2012, as well as more context on how the people of the \\"Arks\\" are chosen.  What could have been a fascinating character study in humanity instead is completely glossed-over by explosions and destruction.  Imagine The Dark Knight without The Joker, and you pretty much get the picture.<br /><br />Thus, unless you are a huge fan of incredible special effects and prolonged action sequences, I would advise you to skip this effort, as it just doesn't bring any more to the table than that.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|This movie was advertised as 'practically new' and it was just that. We have watched it and it plays great, the case was perfect!
B002VECM40|5.0|This was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It is a movie about rising above and redemption but it is not false or sentimental at all. The story and characters feel real. I almost feel like I was watching a reality show about a girl from Harlem. The acting was phenominal. The movie is about a 16 year old incest survivor from Harlem who is pregnant with her second child by her father. Her first suffers Downs Syndrome and is being cared for by her grandmother except on days when the welfare worker makes a home visit. The best acting comes from Monique who plays Precious abusive mother. The scene where she breaks down in the welfare office is unforgetable. This film will win awards on Oscar night. If I could give more stars I would.

B00006L9ZT|4.0|I bought this because I wanted a traditional production of a work that I think is betrayed by most modern directors, and for the excellent Wotan of James Morris.  He does not disappoint, nor does the production.  The greatest Wotan since Hotter, gifted with perhaps a more beautiful voice, and a handsome and eloquent actor, Morris looks and sounds like a god, and makes the transition from the young and brash character into the older and defeated one most creditable.  He sings the way you dream he should.  Also outstanding is Christa Ludwig as Fricka and Waltraute, and Jesseye Norman, as Sieglinde (though you have to suspend disbelief as to her being either a child of Wotan or Siegmund's sister).  Hildegard Behrens, while she never quite sounds like a goddess, and is not a Nilsson, a Varnay or a Flagstad, at least surmounts the vocal challenges of the role, and looks the part of the warrior heroine.  So with Siegfried Jerusalem, who acts well and does look like a believable Siegfried.  He sounds quite good at moments, and a bit less so at others, but again, surmounts the role, though not without effort.  Gary Lakes (Siegmund) and others do a creditable job. James Levine is a wonderful conductor throughout, and the images are quite evocative.  Sound is excellent.
B000TUXL0W|5.0|Better than his first and that is no small feat. Immediately familiar and comforting. Like Paul Simon and others before him, beauty is at its best when depth is more than a dark passenger. Challenging notions with sublime melodies- Doesn't get any better.

This album is awesome, all of the tracks are lively and upbeat to a certain degree, and well, I would definetly recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of the BSB, or just starting out with them, because I love them and their music.
B001EO748M|5.0|Another hit show filled with a beautiful cast. Now if Jonathan Rhys Meyers can just keep himself out of trouble with the law, the drink and the drugs it might have a fourth season too!
0385737947|3.0|Maybe I'm jaded after reading The Hunger Games followed by Catching Fire.  If I'd read this first, maybe my review would be more favorable.  Nice escapism but goes on a tad too long.  Didn't pull me in like the aforementioned books.
0545128285|4.0|Die-hard Harry Potter fans will no doubt want The Tales of Beedle the Bard in their libraries. This collection of wizarding fairy tales (complete with commentary by Albus Dumbledore) provides a behind-the-scenes peek at life in the wizarding world. You can just imagine matronly witches gathering their youngsters onto their laps and reading these stories beside a crackling fire.    But while this book is charming and entertaining, it is not an HP sequel, nor will it do much to satisfy your cravings for one. Aside from Dumbledore's commentaries, you'll find none of the HP characters you know and love and miss so dearly between these covers. And like Quidditch Through the Ages and Magical Beasts and Where to Find Them, this is a book true fans will enjoy but others probably wouldn't appreciate.    As long as you know what you're getting in to, you ought to thoroughly enjoy this little treasure.
B002IR3PSC|3.0|Tull fan for a long time but this DVD is more a curio than must have.  Very disjointed with concert video missing on a few songs then ends too soon on another.  Included is 2nd CD of the same songs on DVD.  Little odd.  Audio only on Sweet Dream, the very hip, One Brown Mouse followed by over-rated Heavy Horses. Broadcast video begins with classic Thick as a Brick.  Unfortunately, after an hour, video ends during Locomotive Breath!  Hello?    Audio only for Too Old to Rock and Roll, My God and Cross Eyed Mary.  Interesting for a couple of reasons:  this was a very early satellite broadcast so time ran out during the concert.  Tony Williams filled in short notice for John Glascok on Bass and finally, Uriah Heep opened this show!  Would be nice to see the whole concert.  Better option is Tull's Isle of Wight.  That's classic!
B001PJRAUS|5.0|This story is a very clever twist.  A light hearted romp through Pride and Prejudice with a delightful change in direction, story line, and I am sure a story that jane would have written if she were alive.  I truly believe that.  Great acting! Miss Price is a real pistol! I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys Austen and Pride and Prejudice, The Jane Austen Book Club, and Becoming Jane!
B002MW50KO|1.0|a knock off, rusty voiced, face slap of a hasty pudding mess.  spare me. Bob, go back to your roots.  you'd have to pay me to buy this.
0307269981|1.0|This really is rubbish. Sooooooooooooooo long winded. I mean, get on with it!!! So much talking about nothing going nowhere. Again, the can all be summarized in 4 to 5 pages. No story, atrociously slow development and a waste of time of your life. There must be better books out there that take the reader on an exciting journey of adventure and intrigue.<br />This is definitely not a page turner. Its a \\"put it down, pick it up again, give it another chance since it cost me so much, put it down cause its crap again, pick it up and lets just hurry up and finish with it\\" book.<br />Not recommended, by me anyway.
0307269981|5.0|I loved Lisbeth Salander in\\" The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" and am thrilled that she takes center stage in this sequel. She has been traveling the world, so she is a little savvier, but just as intriguing, complex and irresistible. She is truly a damaged soul, which is part of her charm. Her strong moral character is juxtaposed by her own set of rules concerning what is right or wrong. Layering this on top of her spunky dare devil attitude makes for one fascinating heroine, she steals the show. As with the first book the plot is fast paced, well researched and tight, a page turner with twists and surprises that will leave you wanting more. Compared to \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" there is not quite as much mystery and although satisfying the ending does not pack as much punch, but it's equally as riveting. In addition to complex unique characters, Stieg Larsson also gives us a fantastic thriller full of psychological suspense and insight into Swedish social and political culture. I am sure I am not alone when I say I look forward to the final book in this series and am sorry there will be no more.
B002T45VX6|5.0|This album is one of the greatest, if not THE greatest, pop albums of 2009. Filled with variation and very obvious and apparent electronia influences, Shakira always is able to create the best music. MUST haves on this album are: She Wolf, Did it again, Gypsy, Spy, Mon Amour, and Good stuff. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED if you buy this whole album!!
0446402397|5.0|This is an incredible debut novel. I really can't say enough about it. The plot is strong and fast paced. The character development is awesome and you don't have to wait long to be drawn into the book as it builds quickly. Once you are pulled in, it's hard to down, it's a page turner. I also love that it's fact based, as I find it intriguing to read about historical evens in an entertaining manner, but it also lends a sense of reality to everything. A real strength of this story is that there are multiple layers to hold your interest, each one intriguing and intense. One thread is based on the story of Russia's first serial killer and a bureaucratic system that is in denial, refusing to acknowledge or investigate, murders simply cannot exist, thus providing the perfect environment for more murders. I found myself in disbelief that this type of thinking could exist in a Nation. Woven in is also a fascinating account of what life held for the Soviet people under Stalin's regime. A life of constantly watching your back, trusting no one and living in fear, a witness to the worst humanity has to offer. To question the state was tantamount to a death sentence with a torture prelude. Trust no one, not your neighbor, your friend, your wife, your parents, no one. Again, where was the rest of the world when this was happening? In short, a great, great read with lots of twists and turns, suspense and intrigue. I did find some of the violence too graphic but don't let that stop you up from reading the book, there is not that much of it. The film rights to Child 44 have been sold to director Ridley Scott.
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|Originally intended as a re release of her hug debut album The Fame, Lady GaGa, after a dispute from her record label, decided to release The Fame Monster as her sophomore disk. Here is my track by track review.<br />1. Bad Romance - We've all heard it. Huge chorus and RedOne production...classic GaGa! Nothing else to say!! 4/5<br />2. Alejandro - My personal favorite on the entire album. It is INSANELY catchy, and will have you saying \\"Ale-ale-jandro\\" for days on end. Oh, and did I neglect to mention that this is another RedOne track? Nuff said!! 5/5<br />3. Monster - A track with some backing track courtesy of Space Cowboy, this is a solid track tinged with Auto-tune (except that when GaGa uses it it is not repetitive or stupid). \\"Muah-Muah-Muah Monster\\", like Alejandro, is bound to get stuck in your head. 4/5<br />4. Speechless - Dun dun DUN!!! The big balled that everyone has been abuzz with. I listened to this track expecting something boring (a ballad just for the sake of having a ballad). BUT..I was PLEASANTLY surprised!! It is not anything that you would normally categorize as a ballad. Stellar vocals and instrumentals make this one of the most memorable tracks. 5/5<br />5. Dance in the Dark - With an ominous \\"D-D-D-D-D-D\\" stuttering introduction, this song is about the darker side of romance and love that GaGa has experienced over the course of the past year of her fame. The chorus is the most memorable and killer part of this song. It has an almost opera/broadway feel at parts! 4/5<br />6. Telephone (featuring Beyonce) - The sole featured track on this album, this song starts off slow for the first 20 seconds or so, but then propels into an AHMAZINGG!!! track. A fast paced song, stellar production, and GaGa's \\"Eh-Eh-Eh-Eh\\" throughout the chorus is amazing. Beyonce's contribution gives a \\"gangsta\\" influence to the song, making it even better! 4.5/5<br />7. So Happy I Could Die - Ok...so this track is as stellar vocally as the rest, but WHY, oh WHYYYY does it have to be about inappropriate subject mattter!! Not even cleverly disguised (like in LoveGame with \\"disco stick\\"), I never like listening out loud to this track because of that. Definitely a misstep. 3/5<br />8. Teeth - Dang, the last two songs of this album had to be the worst? Really? oh well. Anyways..on to \\"Teeth\\". Such a stupid song. SUCH a STUPID song. Having said that...it is REALLY addicting!! Another awesome song..it's just that the song needs at least SOME meaning. 3/5<br /><br />Overall--<br /><br />In summary, this is a stellar, amazing album by the equally amazing and talented Lady GaGa. Much more focused and concentrated than her last album \\"The Fame\\", \\"The Fame Monster\\" is really enjoyable to the last two tracks which, despite being not as good as the rest, are AMAZING nonetheless. This would be an AMAZING addition to anyone's music collection. Must have tracks -<br /><br />Bad Romance<br />Alejandro<br />Speechless<br />Dance In the Dark<br />Telephone<br /><br />(and by that time, it would cost more than just buying the album!! So just GET IT!! =))riate subject mattter!! Not even cleverly disguised (like in LoveGame with \\"disco stick\\"), I never like listening out loud to this track because of that.

0143036742|3.0|(3.5 stars) This novel is full of quirky people and lively witty dialog. On one level it's a fun engaging read, as you loose yourself in the adventures of an 84 year old man lusting after a much younger 36 year old blond bombshell of a woman. I was pulled in almost immediately and I think this was largely because of the spot on description of this younger women. The author's portrayal of this woman as a \\"tart\\" is done with such spice, you just have to smile and keep reading. It's through this type of comic writing that the author leads you though the workings and family drama of this fictional family. I have to admit that even though the main male character is 84, his traits are universal to all men and although presented in a humorous manner are quite realistic. On a deeper more pragmatic level the book deals with a lot of life's frustrations. The author is very genuine in her portrayal of the difficulties of being an immigrant and the reality of caring for an elderly parent. This is a great change of pace book and a smart read but a few things did bother me. The plot is a little cliche, very predictable and at times seems to hover without enough change in pace or tone.
B002UXRH10|4.0|I must admit, I was very eager to hear what kind of music she would come out with after such a tumultuous year, and all I can do is smile and say \\"Wow\\". She is just great here. At first I was very sad to listen to it from start to finish, because she sounded so painfully naked, but that's what music is about sometimes. Her last album (Good Girl Gone Bad) was the first CD I owned of hers (the edginess is what keeps that CD in rotation in my car), but then I listened to her music from before that, and I like the direction she's headed. Bubble Gum Pop is uninteresting to me--she has so much depth to her, to just leave in her one box cheapens her talent. While I am saddened that her life experience gave her this much struggle at such a young age, I applaud her for channeling it in a healthy way and not doing something tragic in response to past events and loss.     So all in all, I give this album 4 stars (hard to get a 5 out of me). My fave songs are \\"Wait Your Turn\\", \\"Stupid in Love\\", \\"Hard\\", \\"Russian Roulette\\" and \\"Rude Boy\\".
B002K5FJOU|5.0|It may not be one of the greatest Miyazaki's films ever, but still it's very beautiful to watch, it remembers me of Totoro, it has the same innocence and charm. It's a must.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I started Weight Watchers in 9/09 and have lost 16 pounds so far. I got tired of running on the treadmill and my other two DVD's (SELF - Bikini Ready Fast and SELF - Slim and Sleek) which are also awesome by the way! I decided to get this DVD because of the other reviews. I did it for the first time yesterday, thinking I was in decent enough shape. Yesterday I couldn't feel my butt. Today, stomach, thighs, chest, shoulders, back and butt are KILLING me! LOVE it! It is the hardest 20 minutes I have ever worked out in my life! When I am able to walk again, I will definitely be doing this DVD again. Love it, love it, love it!
B002I9Z8G2|4.0|I think First Contact was by far one of the top films of the Star Trek canon, and after the bangup job that they did with restoring and remastering The Original Series, I was sort of hoping that it would transfer over into the<br /><br />For example, there was this piece of \\"fuzz\\" that was on the bottom of the screen while Picard and Riker were having their first chat (the scene where he's got Berloiz's opera really loudly in his Ready Room) that looked like it was caught during the film transfer. Seriously, it was huge!<br /><br />Otherwise, it's not too bad. The sound's loud enough to get the neighbors upset with you, and the film makes you forget some of the weaker TV shows and the last movies featuring The Next Generation cast.<br /><br />It's just an average transfer, and for an awesome film, it deserved better.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|For me this is the best so far, the vocal performance is stunning, the whole feel of the CD is laid back & nicely put together.  This has to be something to listen to in the early morning & let it wash over you, the musical spacing is just right.  Love it
B0018CMJSU|5.0|I consider The Godfather to be the greatest film of all time, and I saw it in the theater the first week it was released.  At the time we were all struck by the beautiful cinematography -- the sun-drenched scenes in Sicily, the fall colors of New England.  When The Godfather came out on DVD I was subtly disappointed because the quality of the reproduction simply was not up to par.  Not terrible, mind you, but not up to the standard of the theatrical release.<br /><br />This restoration goes a long way towards restoring the magic of the original release.  I cannot say for sure that it gets us all the way there, but it is a striking improvement. The colors are warm and vibrant, and there are few dust specs or flaws of that type. I am imagining that this is about the best that we can do, given that the film was originally released in the early 1970s.<br /><br />I was sorry to see that a few scenes from the original theatrical release are not included here, in common with the earlier DVD releases.  Nothing major, but a few scenes from Tom Hagan's confrontation with Jack Woltz, scenes of Michael with Kay Adams, and perhaps a few others, are simply gone.  I was hoping that they would be here.  I have seen them a few times on television, but never on DVD.  Too bad.<br /><br />Well worth having and enjoying.  Highly recommended.  RJB.
B0029XFNA8|3.0|What else can I say about the movie.  It is a classic.  This blu ray however is a wast of money.  The blu ray says it has a color version, but it does not.  The transfer is not that great ether.  I can still see flaws in the transfer.  Wait for a better copy.  And please when the disk says it has a color version, give me a color version.
0786868724|2.0|If I were visiting with Mitch Albom, and if we had an afternoon to talk and share, I would enjoy this recounting of a beloved Rabbi's request for his eulogy, coupled with his experience of meeting and understanding Henry and his ministry in Detroit.  Two men of God, while differing in theological preferences, become servants to their congregation and outreach.  I did become fond of the rabbi.  With a Chrisitian background, it gave me the opportnity to get closer to my Jewish friends.  I could understnd the respect and love he garnshed.  Too, I somewhat understood Henry's very different history from a life of crime to a man of God.  The prevailing message seemed to be...cherish the faith you have, revisit it, give freely.  While a powerful message, the book itself, despite its small size, was not a page turner, nor particularly inspiring or interesting.    It seemed a nice read but not one I could easily recommend.
B001R4MEYS|5.0|If you're a die-hard Slayer fan, and like early Mastodon, you might not get on with this. If you are prepared to see a band develop their own niche and become masters of their own vision, then BUY THE RECORD!    There's not much I can add that hasn't been said, but I wanted to say a few things...    I would strongly recommended you get the CD+DVD as the DVD is hugely entertaining.    It is difficult to describe how incredible this record is. The musicianship, composition, arrangement, vision and (for want of better word) 'production', they are all superb. One *whole* album that tells a story but not so obviously as to not leave a sense of mystery.    (Scholars of late 19th and early 20th century history [which I suspect don't include Mastodon themselves] might have to force themselves to accept some considerable creative licence with the Rasputin references etc. But hey, it's art...)    Two other albums that are, for me, as close to dangerous perfection that I've heard this year are Sunn O)))'s [[ASIN:B001UJSVTC Monoliths & Dimensions]] and Mono's [[ASIN:B001Q8FS9S Hymn to the Immortal Wind]]. If you don't mind experimenting away from the Mastdon path, I'd also recommend Wolves in the Throne Room's [[ASIN:B001RXB4EA Black Cascade]], Zu's [[ASIN:B001KKRD6I Carboniferous]], Tombs's [[ASIN:B001OTXM38 Winter Hours]], Black Bone Angel's [[ASIN:B002HF88D2 Verdun]], Eagle Twin [[ASIN:B002BYSG0E The Unkindness of Crows]] and Snail's [[ASIN:B002EC39B4 Blood]].    (I assumed that the Shrinebuilder [[ASIN:B002L132VU Shrinebuilder]], Kylesa [[ASIN:B001OBBR5Q Static Tensions]], OM God Is Good, Minsk With Echoes in the Movement of Stone and Isis's Wavering Radiant albums were fairly obvious - but if not, check these out too.)    It's late, I'm delerious and I thought \\"why not throw in these 'why not try something a bit different' recommendations too\\" so I did: Crippled Black Phoenix The Resurrectionists & Night Raider, James Blackshaw The Glass Bead Game and KTL IV.
B002AT4K9Q|2.0|What made the original and 2 sequels (horrible and cheasy sequels) at least decent was the campy nature and general love for import racing and streetracing. You felt that the movie was made by import car enthusiasts FOR import car enthusiasts. Sure the plot of the original might've been stretched and forced and at some points desperate, and the acting might've been somewhat cheesy, but overall you came to love the characters because they felt like real people, maybe not poeple you'd know or hang out with but real people. They messed up, got into fights, made mistakes, and became vulnerable and emotional. On top of that, the cars had a personality of their own, the car LINGO was interesting, and the overall love for cars was noteworthy. It was like the feeling of a car enthusiast going \\"yea, that's right\\" and almost feeling like they can contribute to all the gearhead talk of the first flick.   Then came the 2 sequels which while may have failed in the script and acting department, still won in the car enthusiast department. You watched the movie for the fast gorgeous cars, the hookups and the sexy women, and that's all you needed.     Now come in the 3rd sequel (or REAL first sequel) to the original; Fast and Furious. In short, the movie starts off promising within the first 5 minutes, but quickly becomes sunk and buried under its own desperate need to create a \\"streetracer kingpin crime\\" story that goes nowhere and achieves close to nothing. The film becomes boring after about an hour of overly serious talk and desperate attempts to get us to simply ACCEPT and STILL love these original characters from the first film even though they offer absolutely NO characterization in this new story of theirs.   To filmmakers: even if there were 5 F&F sequels featuring the same people and all of the first 4 films were golden, you STILL need to create worthwhile character situations and circumstances in the 5th film or else we'd hate it, memorable characters or no memorable characters. You cannot expect their performances in the original film to carry through to this one where there pretty much are no performances worth raving about.     The second tragic mistake about this film that the filmmakers made apart from deadpan characterization and an overlong and needlessly serious story and plot development is the complete absence of ANY sort of car enthusiast vibe or persona. Sure there are nice cars, and 1 noteworthy racing scene featuring nice hooked up cars (which lasts for like 5 minutes out of a 110 minute film), but there is NO car enthusiast talk, and NO excitement over street racing. They pretty much made a street racing movie without any real street racing nor ABOUT street racing. This is no longer a car enthusiast film made by enthusiasts for enthusiasts, it is now a crime drama 'reveal the druglord' movie made by greedy filmmakers trying to con enthusiasts by using the same characters from their earlier beloved Fast and Furious movie and trying to put it off as another dose of the same thing, when it indeed is nowhere NEAR comparable to the original.     And one more thing - what's with the forced hispanic \\"chicano\\" vibe of this whole thing? Now all of a sudden out of nowhere our main man Dom Torretto is no longer an average white guy gearhead but spanish? Was the first F&F movie too \\"white\\" for audiences? Did they feel they needed to \\"minority\\" it up to make it \\"cooler\\" and more underground like? Even the soundtrack is all a bunch of spanglish rap/hip-hop music that'll get on your nerves eventually. In the original there were various people and racers of various backgrounds and cultures, but they simply acted as such and didn't feel a need to rub it in other people's (or our) faces, they were real about who they were. Now all of a sudden everyone's gotta speak Spanglish and have a rippling bod? I am of hispanic heritage and I just find the whole thing forced and stupid. I can't imagine an average white viewer to be able to relateto this in the least, even IF they were a car enthusiast. Add a dash of a few scenes of grossly anorexic-thin girls making out with each other for \\"sex appeal\\" and you've got a forced and rushed film doused and marinated in CGI to simply make a quick buck by recycling old characters yet using them to no degree; they're all merely there for show to try and get you to buy a ticket.     On the upside, the blu-ray movie has really cool and interesting extras you might wanna check out. If you're a girl and find Vin Diesel and Paul Walker incredibly hot this is the movie for you, but I don't see any guys apart from burnout losers finding anything redeeming about this film besides a couple of decent action scenes.
B001EAWMGA|3.0|\\"Outlander\\" is actually an absorbing science fiction film featuring decent acting, above-average characterization, and a solid storyline. The protagonist has crash-landed on Earth, circa 790 AD in Norway, among the Vikings. He has inadvertently brought with him a member of a very dangerous dragon-like race who promptly starts killing Vikings. The protagonist is faced with the problem of being accepted among the Vikings, and also how to deal with the alien \\"Morwen.\\" It all sounds formulaic, and it is, but actually the storyline moves along briskly. The cinematography of this film is particularly good, featuring Viking mountain and seascapes.<br /><br />Not at all a bad flick. Recommended. RJB.
B00133KFGW|5.0|I love love love this movie. The music is beautiful and all the acting is very good. I must say that Freddie Highmore is so adorable in this movie as Evan Taylor/August Rush. I won't give you a summary of the plot, because you can read that in other reviews, but I will say that if you are a person who wakes up in the morning and always thinks my life/this world is a black hole of depression and nothing ever good happens then you'll probably hate this movie. However, if you are a happier person and believe that this world CAN be beautiful and inspirational than you will like it. Watch it, especially if you love music.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Wow, when I saw this in the theater, I was blow away. I honestly didn't think it was going to be as good as it was. I loved it.<br /><br />This starts out with us seeing Mr. Kirk on the USS Kalvin. He's then made Captain then has to set the self destruct to blow up and enemy ship. When all of this is happening, his wife gives birth to Kirk.  Things don't turn out as planned, the enemy ship isn't destroyed.<br /><br />Years pass (I don't want to give away to much) and Kirk is made \\"acting\\" Captain of the Enterprise.  He has to stop a Romulan named \\"Nero\\".  Nero plan's to destroy all of the planets in the Federation so he can get his revenge.  That's all I really want to say on what happens.  You have to see it first hand.<br /><br />There are so much positives to this movie. If you're a fan of Trek, then you'll be drawn in. If you have never seen an apy of it, then don't worry, you can still enjoy it, but not get all of the little jokes in it.  One of the jokes is what happens to the guy wearing a red suit.<br /><br />I also like how we're introduced to the crew. On how we meet Kirk, Spock and the rest of the crew.  It was also interesting to see how Kirk and Spock were not friends when they first met. As a matter of fact, they really hated each other.  That just added a lot to the movie.<br /><br />The casting is excellent!  Kirk and Spock were right on. The best casting came to Dr. McCoy. That was **spot** on. When he opened his mouth to talk, my jaw dropped. They couldn't have made a better choice.  I also liked Scotty. I hope we see more of him in the next movie.<br /><br />As for Nero, he was a very interesting character. What made him so interesting is what motivated him to do what he did.  He was a peaceful Romulain. He was a husband and a father. To make a long story short is that his world was destroyed and the set him out for revenge.  I won't say who or how Romulain was destroyed, you have to see it for yourself.<br /><br />This is a must have if you have a blu ray player. The sound and images are INCREDIBLE!!!  If you get Star Trek, I can promise you won't be sorry. I know I wasn't.!  If you get Star Trek, I can promise you won't be sorry. I know I wasn't.

B001PPGKRG|5.0|Handel's solo keyboard works tend to be overshadowed by Bach's and are thus rarely heard. This is a great pity, as there is much delightful music in these works. This is brought out by the young German pianist Ragna Schirmer in this 3-CD collection. Played on a modern piano, rather than on the harpsichord for which they were written, Frau Schirmer produces effortless, elegant performances that dance beautifully along.
B002JODV3S|4.0|Who ever directed/edited the camera work, was a musician... if not steve himself. the set list was only a blue powder short of perfect.  The only other area that annoyed me, was Steve raising his arm seeking an applause after each lick.

I am past the return deadline and have not figured out how to fix this order with Amazon.  My experience on this order was completely frustrating.  It took 4 weeks to ship and now that we finally opened it, it is missing parts.  How frustrating.  Sound quality and extras on what we received is great.  Update - to be fair, I have updated this post to note Amazon's very fast assistance to correct the missing cd. Thank you Amazon for standing behind your sales!
B002NPUCRQ|5.0|This album is awesome. I love the new six songs; also, the DVD has a lot of extras that you will enjoy to see. I LOVE TAYLOR SWIFT.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I bought this for my parents for Christmas. We've always loved the series and at the price we purchased - it's an amazing value. Beautifully done series!
B0027BOL4G|4.0|I completely enjoyed this film, even though yes - the information is found in many other sources, the assembling of the material was well done.<br /><br />The only problem the film seems to neglect is the simple fact is there is too many people for the amount of food required globally.  If sustainability is the end intention of the film, which I believe is the true message, then all this does is draw a call to action to fix (end) the realities of America's manipulation of abundant cheap food which ultimately will result in the same outcome; world hunger due to too many mouths.<br /><br />It is not politically correct to suggest we limit reproduction but essentially that is what is the only true solution to the issues on a global scale which the film dances around (however elegant it might suggest otherwise)  Let's be honest the population of the world looks like a hockey stick and the only result of such explosions upward are sharp corrections downward; which are witnessed in everything from collapsing ecosystems to stock market bubbles.  All are indicative of correction in some form or another and one thing humans have proven time and time again is our ability to \\"not change\\" until collapse/catastrophe but thankfully we adapt very well and change afterwards.<br /><br />Some of you may feel change can occur to avoid such limitations, or argue redefining the system can meet all our needs but if viewed as a whole - across multiple issues outstanding and the realities of our continued multiplication that in the end it achieves the same result; we are simply a bad case of fleas until the earth decides to rid herself of us - she will.<br /><br />Perhaps Earth Day should be renamed to People Day, since we are the ones at risk of exterminating ourselves... a simple asteroid can reset the whole process over again, and again, and again.. since we may have reached the limitation of this version.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|I know the critics beat Dan Brown up, he never claimed to be a brilliant writer, just one that does write entertainment and in this book I was entertained, and it is an easy read, which critics do not typically appreciate the value of. It has made me want to go to Washington, which I never did before, so it did open up some dusty areas in my mind, he did some interesting research into the Mason's which a few men in my family were, so I enjoyed it for what it was, an entertaining easy read. There were a few times I got a little lost, can not even remember where those places were, but I enjoyed it, kept the pages turning on my kindle and would try another book of his for an easy read.
B002N1AERI|1.0|epica's new album, \\"Design Your Universe\\" is an obvious enough title. There she is after all, on the front of the album looking directly to \\"you\\" or in my case \\"me\\". At first it didn't really bother me, but then I started to think more about it. I wondered if she could really see me. That's when I discovered the hologram effect in the album art. If any of you don't know, take the album jacket into the bathroom or anywhere with a mirror. Light a candle in the room, but turn off all other lights and shut the door. Hold the album jacket up to the mirror and look at epica's reflection. Slowly move the jacket at a 45 degree angle right and left. Her mouth starts moving and I swear I could here her say my name!. She really was looking DIRECTLY TO ME! I immediately burned the album cover in the candle and I could hear Simmone screaming. I don't recommend that anyone else try this. Ever since that day I have been drinking only orange juice, and I don't know why. I seriously can't stop drinking orange juice. I can't stop drinking orange juice. No matter how hard I try I just can't stop drinking orange juice. Orange juice. Juice. Epica.
0689865384|4.0|It's a good book. It takes you somewhere else, you wouldn't ever imagine yourself, but you identify with the characters and find commonalities with them so it's within reach. It's a fun, fast read. Definitely young adult fiction, but I really enjoy that it challenges our current culture and makes you question the world around you. Another good book.
0316069906|3.0|There was a lot of great information in this book, especially for those who've never contemplated the state of modern food.  However, the writing was choppy in a lot of places and struggled to stay on topic.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|This purchase was a gift for my (step)son. The quality of the DVDs and packaging was excellent. The shipping was timely and the package arrived in perfect condition. Overall doing business with Amazon was pleasant.    The story line for Sons of Anarchy is for adults only and this fact should be made very clear to all parents who have never viewed the series.     In a small and bucolic town in California, Charming, a \\"club\\" of anti establishment men and women live side by side with those of a more conservative outlook. The \\"club\\" embraces the violence and sexuality of the 1960's motorcycle clubs- men rule, women are subtly subservient, and society's laws are unimportant if in conflict with the needs of the club members. Riding Harleys,driving big engine vehicles, and covered with tats the men are sometimes handsome, always mean and violent, and have a code of ethics that applies to the society of the club, not society at large. The women are usually in tight jean and low cut shirts,their sexuality like a second skin. In contrast to all of this is the obvious love and loyalty the members have for each other. The interaction of the various love interests as well as the friendships interjects humanity into the storyline. The loyalty shown to a code, however misguided,allows viewers to empathize with the characters.  The stories follow the \\"day in the life\\" events of the club through various skirmishes with law enforcement, rival gangs,most notable the Aryan Nation.       This is fiction, and viewed as such can be a fun. The idea, in today's world, of a group of outlaws who defy the corporate minions,(in one episode a character punches a pesky administrator in the nose when said administrator seeks to have HER dismissed for helping a patient receive needed paid for by insurance medical care) or violate restrictive laws ( two characters share a joint openly in front of a hospital),can hold appeal. Make no mistake however, this is still violent sexual content. Women are viewed as property. Violence is shown to be a problem solving tool. Laws are shown to be obstacles to success. Not a story for everyone.
B0026P3G12|5.0|My heart has always been to look inside to the real person and not to \\"judge a book by its cover,\\" however I saw nothing wrong in the cover.  Susan Boyle represents \\"everywoman,\\" not those who have nothing more than outside beauty which quickly fades with time, leaving nothing behind.  She has an angelic, powerful, touching voice and I look forward to much more music from this beautiful woman. Each song on her CD speaks a message to the world from a lady who dared to dream.
B000070WJE|5.0|I was sitting at a train station in Europe, listening to my radio when Robbie Williams came on. I was blown away by his voice and immediately looked him up online. Slowly began purchasing his music, one album at a time, and now have made my way to Escapology - by far the best album thus far (I just purchased his new \\"Reality...\\" album as well which I have not grown to).  I been listening to the songs on this album over and over again and can't shut it off - 'Come Undone', 'Love Somebody', 'Monsoon', and 'Love Somebody' are some of my favorite hits.  If you are trying to get introduced to Robbie Williams, I would recommend this track listing or his \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilation.   Also surprised he is not big in the US....
0385340990|5.0|Gems:<br />A completely engaging story from start to finish.  A core group of developed characters mingled with history grounded in a 'real-life' account that brings the era alive through the eyes of average citizens.  Although heroic in their survival, the characters in the story are not over-played or over-sympathetic or fantastic.  Instead, the story rightfully depicts the life of several people during a time of war, each having their own unique story and coping skills that is beautifully developed through friendship, community, love and morality, as well as humor.  The heavy, and otherwise dreary themes are lightened, but not cheapened by the use of clever comic relief that is refreshing and inserted in just the right spot to make a heart-wrenching story tolerable.  Instead of being drug down by the topic, the story is uplifted and inspiring without taking away from the seriousness of the subject or historical period.<br /><br />Flaw:<br />I'm having a hard time finding anything to write in this section of my review.  Although in my opinion, it is not truly a con, I will say that the story is a bit predictable.  Given that it is told through letters, it is forced to go along a fairly predicable course, which leads to an obvious outcome.  However, this did not take away from the wonderful story, mostly because it was interesting and did not need plot twists and action surprises to keep me hook.  However, if you're hoping for a zing, it's not coming -- it will end how you think it will end, but it still feels right and in my humble opinion, agreeable.
B0000AK7AA|2.0|I only bought this movie because I had discovered Clint Eastwood was in it.  I collect all movies that he is in.  He just has a cameo in one scene and a few lines.  The story in this movie is not for kids and does not make much sense.  It is nothing like the Casper cartoons that I watched as a kid that I enjoyed.  It has a good cast but their talents are wasted on an awful script.  It goes to show you if Steven Spielberg is involved and you spend 50 million dollars on a movie people will come and see it whether it is good or not.  Eric Idle of Monty Phython is in it who is normally very funny.  They do not use his talents to their advantage in the movie.  He doesn't get much in the way of funny scenes.  Casper is portrayed pretty well, but he is put in situations that he would have never been in in any of the cartoons.  The father's death in the movie is made light of even though he is brought back to life later.  This would not be good for little kids.
B001I82RVS|5.0|Awesome! It's very entertaining, it's weird, it's cheesy, it's funny and it's extremely gory! It's not as good as The Machine Girl, but it's just as gory (maybe even gorier) and most of the effects are awesome! Nothing else to say really... It's simply absolutely *beep* awesome!     It's definitely in the top 10 goriest movies ever and that's coming from someone who has seen all of the movies that are considered to be gory!    I can't wait for Yoshihiro Nishimura's next movie!     Buy it! Unless you're a boring person who takes movies too seriously and can't laugh at the ridiculous.
B001EN71DG|3.0|I bought this set simply because it did have the original movies and it's the only digital version of the originals available. I actually do enjoy the added CG, along with the upgraded sound on the new versions, but i want to choose which one i want to watch. I'm hoping Georgie releases both versions on Blu-ray soon. I was hoping for Christmas, but that doesn't appear to be happening.     Jon
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I loved everything about it and the actors are brilliant. The story is simple but very emotional and that's what kept watching. I have everything wonderful to say about it, that's why I would recommend this to everyone who loves BBC period dramas.
B002JCSWUW|1.0|Mr. Eastwood - please remain with your Dirty Harry cop fluff and leave South Africa alone.  On the other side of the coin - who really cares?  It would have been really interesting to have locals play the leads and in Afrikaans and local native languages instead of the pseudo-Anglo accents.<br /><br />So - Stop exploiting!<br /><br />We can solve our own problems .....step away.  There's also a whole cesspool of undivulged propaganda buried in that period - and no one will touch it.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan's voice is unbelievable and from the first time I heard her on Britain's Got Talent until I heard this album, there is no denying that this is a voice for the ages.  Its clarity and feeling is unmatched and as I listened to her voice, I closed my eyes and found tears running down my cheeks.  Tears not from sadness but from the utter joy that came upon me from the sounds and feeling of her and the music.  This album was put together in such a manner as to show her sweetness and power that she can portray with her voice and inner feelings.  Some of the songs are truly words from Susan to everyone who has denied her in the past and who now can listen to her words that she can \\"do it\\" and it \\"can be done\\"! Thank you for this album and will surely be looking for the next one.
B002NY731U|5.0|I own every Megadeth album released and many bootlegs, some are great (Rust in Peace, Youthanasia)and some are not(Cryptic Writings, Risk)but this one is AMAZING!    This album does NOT dethrone Rust in Peace as the bands magnum opus nor take my spot for the second best album by the band(Youthanasia)but it IS the most pure-to-the-roots effort since Rust In Peace!    The themes are ambitious and so is the production, writing, playing (some of the best solos EVER)and vocal deliverance by Mustaine.           There are three sides to Megadeth imo; songs like Holy Wars, Hook In Mouth and Tornado of Souls are are flat out perfect classic Megadeth rockers.  Others such as Train of Consequences, Symphony of Destruction and When are more \\"modern era\\" Megadeth classics. Finally tracks like The Scorpion, A Secret Place and Crush 'Em are somewhere in between.  All three of these categories have had strong hit and misses in their respective areas    Endgame fuses the best of both perfectly and is an instant Megadeth classic!!       The best way to describe Endgame is to take the whole journey of Megadeth's evolution and only filter the best of all aspects.  Combine all of this with a grandoise effort and flavor likened to Rust In Peace and you have the excellent new offering which is Endgame.    This is Megadeth's Rust in Peace 2009 and their return to excellence!!    Don't miss this one droogies!!!
B001JNNDDI|1.0|I always keep my reviews short, I hate to bore people as much as the movie.  I guess because of the cast the movie was pumped up so much.  I wouldn't buy this movie but rent it first then you can decide.
B001OQCV24|5.0|OH DEAR CHILDREN ...... on what side of the pumpkin were you born?<br />OF course the wealthy, inbred filth lives on to create yet another corrupt society dominated by ignorance the the \\"fear of that happens after - glurk - death\\".<br /><br />Now that that's out of the way - the movie?  This far surpasses the Spielberg candy - these men have always given us superior and testosterone laced entertainment - formula?  Sure - just recheck old [the first] \\"Poseidon Adventure\\" - etc.<br /><br />Tremendous special effects - if only this were shot in IMAX and 3D - oh but then the paramedics would have to stand by.<br /><br />Atlantis?  Now have we forgotten the legend of LEMURIA?
B0028SVXR6|2.0|This album is not bad, but \\"not bad\\" doesn't cut it when Tremulant, de-loused and Frances were Amazing.  They have definitely lost a certain element that truly absorbed listeners; it might have something to do with Jon Theodore.  I understand they changed when they \\"followed their own creative instincts\\" as some reviewers have mentioned, but just because they change does not make it a masterpiece.  To this day I can still listen to Tremulant, de-loused and Frances without wanting to skip tracks.  That does not happen with the newer records.  They are not getting more creative, they are getting redundant with the same vocals, riffs and chops.  Their song structure in this and the past two records feels like they only make music because they can and it is expected of them.  It's plain stupid to say that fans should not compare the new records to the older ones.  WHY NOT?  If you listen to them because you like their music and then they change what you like about them, it is obvious that you'll compare the before and after.  There is such a thing as musical tastes and certain aspects of their new records are less appealing.  Some of the devoted fans will lie to themselves and pretend they are amazing no matter what they do.  Most of the people that love the new Mars Volta records just found out about them recently and were most likely introduced to these new albums first.  Bottom line, this Record is plain \\"not bad\\".
B001AQT0RC|5.0|We love this movie!  Decided to purchase the new BluRay release since our old DVD was somehow damaged while moving.  Really impressed at how sharp the images are. Great conversion to blu ray. If you love Contact, you'll love this new edition.
B002IVLH60|5.0|While others have come and gone Pearl Jam continues to pour out some great music. They have always had \\"it\\" just expressed in different ways musically now...like a bottle of wine that ages. Like and album worth its weight you have to invest a few weeks time into it to find all the good nuggets, songs you didnt like at all will soon becaome some of your favorites off this body of work.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B002QEXN2K|5.0|I love this new album.  I loved it on the first listen, I loved following John as he shared the making of it on YouTube, and I love it more the more I listen to it.    But then again, I'm a big fan of John's musical sound.    I completely understand where the critics are coming from, however.  The first time that I listened to Heavier Things, I thought that it wasn't as good as Room For Squares.  But the more I listened to it, the more I \\"discovered\\" its genius... and now this classic album is my favorite JM album of all time.  The first time I listened to \\"Continuum,\\" I wasn't completely crazy about it, but it did grow on me and soon I was in love with it.  And of course, seeing the magic as John transformed those Continuum songs on-stage from the \\"studio\\" versions to something completely mind-blowing is always an essential element, for me, in making permanent room in my heart for each and every song.    My point is that while I do see some merit in what all the naysayers are saying, I also think that John's studio work pretty much always has a certain way of not winning everyone over INITIALLY.  But I also think that John is a musical genius, and that everything he does is always done consciously, deliberately, and for a reason that might not be obvious to all of us... at least initially.  Sometimes the surprise comes later, when he takes a studio production and totally rocks it out on stage... and then you never listen to the song the same way again.  That is what happened to me on Continuum, for a lot of the songs.      On Continuum, sometimes I just didn't \\"get\\" why John kept the lyrics or guitar riffs so simplistic, so \\"beneath\\" his talent if you will.  But then in concert he rocks it out, and over time you come to realize... with the help of a few JM interviews along the way... that John does those things deliberately.  He has publicly said that he enjoys writing melodies and creative studio work, and that just because you CAN rock out doesn't mean that you always SHOULD.  He has stated that there is also a skill called \\"restraint.\\"  Also, with lyrics... sometimes the song, the music, the feeling that John wants to convey through the music would just be ruined with complex lyrics.  Maybe saying \\"I'm Perfectly Lonely\\" is all that needs to be said, over and over.  It makes the song sound lonelier when the lyrics are lonely too.      In other words, folks, I really believe that John orchestrates this stuff down to the wire.    That said, I really think that after the Battle Studies tour, anyone who is not a fan of the album now will definitely love it after they hear those songs performed live.      As for those who criticize it for being too \\"pop\\"... John has made it clear on many occasions that he considers himself to be a pop artist and enjoys writing pop music, and he makes no apologies for that.  Yeah, he can rock and sing the blues and play hip hop and get all jazzy on us... and he'll do all that again too.  But it'll be on his terms, and not from any kind of pressure he gets from fans or the industry.  So if pop music ain't your thang, maybe John Mayer just isn't for you.      As for me, no further convincing is necessary.  I am already in love with these songs.  They make me happy, they make me tap my foot and shake my booty, and they make me eager to see John doing them live.    \\"Assassin\\" is a complex song, lyrically and musically, and it is my favorite song on the CD.  I also think \\"Edge of Desire\\" is pretty great.  As for the others, I recognize that John has tried a bunch of new stuff and has had a lot of fun doing it... and I truly appreciate the effort, all around.  I find it fun to listen to, and I can't stop.    The new band sounds fantastic.  Steve Jordan's drumming on the album is spectacular and I would say pretty much \\"perfection,\\" and drives the whole thing.      I'm not going to go as far as to say if you like John Mayer, you will love this album.  Because I actually know a lot of John Mayer fans whoare a bit disappointed with it.  But for every one of those, I know another fan who loves it.  So judge it for yourself.  Just don't be surprised if you dislike it at first but then it starts to grow on you... and then six months from now you are in love with it.  That seems to be the effect that Mayer goes for.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|First off, i have been a metal-loving rocker for a lont time now, and while i was only a fan of metallica for quite some time... my freind had me listen to \\"Rust in Peace\\" by megadeth, and totally loved it.  After exploring other megadeth's stuff, i heard that their new album Endgame was coming out.  I had my doubts after the some-what dissapointment of Metallica's Death Magnetic.   BOY WAS I WRONG!!!  THis album is excellent in honestly anyway. The riffs roar, solos scream, and dave's voice i think is better than ever.  Aight here goes the track list....     1: Dialectic Chaos:  Best opener ever-- incredicle screaming solos over fast riffing make for an awesome yet short first track    2: This day we Fight: This song is awesome simply because of how fast and hard-hitting it is.  Although its kinda corny how mustaine uses the Lord of the Rings trilogy for inspiration for this song    3: 44 Minutes: The second single on the album and also my personl FAVORITE!!  A realy catchy intro of a  911 call and a solo that starts slow and builds into some pretty epic tapping a tremelo picking.  in the last 15-20 seconds of this song, brodericks soloing will pretty much leave anybody bowing down to his greatness.  Also a pretty catchy chorus too!    4: 1320:  Definately a solid song right here, and reminds us what an intro megadeth riff should sound like. Fast and hard, defintaly a good song    5: Biot the Hand:  Close second for personal favorite. Excellent lyrics with pounding riffs. Mustaine here really focuses on economic trouble and wall stret. this song includes my favorite line... \\"When its dog eat dog you are what u eat\\" refereing to wall street.  Reallly cool Song!!!    6: Bodies:  Pretty good song with really good instrumentals -- yet for some reason the way mustaine sings \\"bodies left behind\\" bugs me.. dont know why, but either way its another great song.    7: Endgame: Title track and also up there in the top 5 on the album. I think this one is about a  dream mustaine has about the president of the us taking over  america. Kinda funky the way he goes about saying it, but has probably the coolest intro and also a really catchy chorus.    8: Hardest part of letting go:  Ballad about love.. something mustaine rarely talks about. but he does so well.  slow intro which then speeds up into a riff that puts any dream theater song to shame    9: Headcrusher: 1st single? idk why... this is in my opinion the weakest song on the album.. although its really fast and includes a really cool bridge...the lyrics are really graphic and while i like a song i can connect to, i really cant do so when hes talking about your head getting squeezed until it pops.  Ill probably get yelled at for saying so.. but sry, just my opinion.    10: How the Story ends:  Doesnt really stand out but still the normal... good riffs, good lyrics, good solos, good song.    11: The right to go insane: originally titled \\"nothing left to lose\\" i think it shoudl have remained that way but u know whatever.  this one is also pretty catchy with some excellent instrumentsls.    sry for all the spelling mistakes.. didnt have mush time to write this, but in conclusion -- this album proves that thrash metal has returned stronger than ever, and whether u prefer megadeth or metallica, it really doesnt matter cause this album rocks!!!!!
B0000584V3|5.0|Being an Opeth fan for some time now and owning almost all of their studio albums, I think that \\"Blackwater Park\\" may be their overall best, even if it isn't my overall favorite. The first thing you'd probably think after reading that is, \\"What makes this Opeth's best album?\\". And my answer would be this:    \\"Blackwater Park\\" is probably Opeth's overall best album because it captures their songwriting at its best. Opeth writes each of the eight songs by going by what makes musical sense. The songs are more concise, with the sections being less drawn-out. This shows that Opeth was focused more on the content of the song, and not just writing a 10-minute song for the sake of writing a 10-minutes song (even though three of the eight songs are over 10 minutes, but regardless...).    Keep in mind though, I am NOT trashing Opeth as songwriters. I think they make some of the most exciting and interesting metal of their peers. However, on other albums some songs, as great as they may be, may have had passages that went on for a little too long, were a little too drawn out. I think here, Opeth's songwriting skills are at their peak: Each one of the songs is interesting and well-done, and there wasn't a second when I thought it was too drawn-out.    Of course, Opeth has also always been a band that is packed with musical talent. Mikael Akerfeldt, alongside being a skilled guitarist, is, in my opinion, the greatest death metal vocalist today. His growls are so powerful and gigantic, it's as if his vocals came from demons. HOWEVER! Mikael is also the possessor of a beautiful clean voice; when he sings cleanly over gentle, acoustic passages, shivers run down my spine. It's hard to believe somebody could be amazing at both demonic death growls and beautiful clean singing. The rest of the band is great, too, being on top of every change in each song and doing so with gusto.    From the brutal and intense heavy parts to the mystical and beautiful soft parts, this album just works.It's amazing to think that such a work of musical art comes from a band that can be considered death metal, but that's part of what's so great. Such a landmark metal album comes highly recommended to both death metal fans and non-death metal fans. For something that combines beauty with brutality, \\"Blackwater Park\\" is a high-water mark in an amazing band's history. Thanks for the time, and peace.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I purchased the mono box set as a gift. I had read a lot about the set and for a Beatles lover, it was a great gift.
B000W07EKW|5.0|This trilogy is simply amazing! All three movies are great and easily stand alone as films. Together they make a non-stopped, action-packed collection that will keep you entertained the whole way through. If you don't have this already, it's time to break down and buy it.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I love every single song on this CD! Usually I really like 2, maybe 3 songs on an album. Not this time. Every one is completely beautiful and moving. I don't think Susan Boyle is capable of singing a bad song. I can't explain what it is, but there's something touching about her voice. I waited a long time for this CD, and now I can hardly wait for her next one.
B00005O3VD|5.0|Funny Girl (directed by William Wyler) is a hilarious, wonderful musical lightly based on the life of comedienne and actress Fanny Brice. The film version is based on the stage musical that premiered on Broadway in 1964.<br /><br />Fanny Brice (Barbra Streisand) is a Jewish girl from New York City who simply wants to make it as a star. Eventually she makes it all the way to the Ziegfeld Follies and stars in some of Florenz Ziegfeld`s (Walter Pidgeon) productions.<br /><br />She soon falls in love with a worldly gambler (who she's met before), Nick Arnstein (Omar Sharif), and leaves theatre behind to marry him. The rest of the musical follows their rocky marriage and Brice's reemergence into theatre and comedy.<br /><br />Streisand shines in this movie. In my opinion this is Streisand at her comedic best. Her acting is natural and she delivers her lines perfectly. Her facial expressions are enough to make me laugh. She is a gem. Her character Fannie Brice believes all she has going for her is her humor but Streisand shows us that Brice is so much more than that. She is funny, caring, beautiful and resilient. She will stop at nothing to get what she wants in life.<br /><br />Every scene in this movie that was meant to be funny is. The \\"His Loves Makes Me Beautiful\\" is brilliant and leaves me wondering if they truly could have gotten away with that musical number in the early 1900s. Streisand's character refuses to sing about how beautiful she is and, in protest, shoves a pillow up her dress and pretends to be pregnant in the number.<br /><br />The \\"Roller Skate Rag\\" is also hilarious. It's humorous seeing Brice trying to roller skate and knocking the other skaters down in the process.<br /><br />The songs and musical score are amazing. The more serious \\"People\\" fits perfectly with the rest of the movie. It is one of Streisand's best performances in the film. Also, no one can forget \\"Don't Rain On My Parade\\". It's a signature Barbra Streisand song for a reason. She belts it out with enormous emotion and proves to us that no one could ever sing it as well as her.<br /><br />The supporting cast that consists of Sharif, Brice's mother (Kay Medford), Pidgeon and Georgia James (Anne Francis) complete the movie. Streisand is certainly the break out star in the film but it wouldn't be the same without the rest of the cast; especially Shariff.<br /><br />After I saw Funny Girl for the first time I listened to the entire soundtrack and found myself singing along to every song. It's my favorite musical and, like Paper Moon, I highly recommend it.us that no one could ever sing it as well as her.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout is great.  I just had my 3rd baby and didn't think I'd ever be able to get back my old boday.  This workout helps so much.  I've done excercise videos since I was 15 and this is one of the best.  Gillian's no nonsense, work hard, attitude is great.  I have recommended this to friends all ready.  It really does deliver
1573300403|5.0|I love this DVD. However, I wish they would have kept the \\"brace youself\\" at the beginning of the film instead of putting it at the end, lol :P  And I wish they would have included the 2 Bad short film in there as well. Overall, I loved it. I always love watching MJ vids. I would definitely recommend it to any MJ fan.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Elf (directed by Jon Favreau) is a lighthearted Christmas comedy that will suit the entire family. It should be on anyone's list of Christmas movies to watch.<br /><br />Buddy (Will Ferrell) is an elf that lives in the North Pole and makes toys for Santa. There's one slight problem, though. He isn't small like the other elves or nearly as skilled at assembling toys. His father, Papa Elf (Bob Newhart), admits to Buddy that he was adopted and that his real father lives in New York City. Buddy sets off to find his birth father (played by James Caan) and discovers much more along the way including a stepmother (Mary Steenburgen), half-brother (Daniel Tay), possible crush (Zooey Deschanel) and the true meaning of Christmas.<br /><br />Ferrell plays a child well. Buddy has no idea how to act around people that aren't constructing toys for Santa. He embodies the joys of Christmas time and displays Buddy's innocence of the world around him well. In my opinion this is one of Ferrell's best movies. It's impossible not to smile during a scene he is in.<br /><br />Deschanel meshes with Ferell nicely and the two have great chemistry. Her lovely, jazzy voice reminiscent of the 40s also adds a pleasant touch. When she is singing Christmas songs in the shower and at the end of the movie, it's simply magical. Ferrell's voice isn't to bad either.<br /><br />The movie presents a good message that both children and adults can appreciate. Believing in Santa requires a leap of faith and we are reminded why it is so easy for children to take that leap. Elf warns us not to lose our imaginations as we grow older and that family and friends are the most important things in the world. Buddy's real father, Walter, finally manages to grasp this idea at the end of the film and I'm happy that he does.<br /><br />The dialogue, jokes and themes are executed well by the director. Ferrell's innocence never gets tiresome and his reactions to life in New York City are hilarious. His views on life are a breath of fresh air and makes me wish I could see the world through his eyes.<br /><br />Elf is a movie that you can watch during anytime of the year. It's incredibly sweet and the entire cast is fantastic in their acting roles. The message of holiday cheer shines through in this film and generates laughs at the same time.could see the world through his eyes.    Elf is a movie that you can watch during anytime of the year.

0307269981|5.0|I read at least two books a week and this series of book is by far some of the best I have read in a long time. I ordered the sample on my Kindle but could not make up my mind from the first couple of chapters if it was going to be my kind of book. I am so glad I listened to all the great reviews because I could not put it down!

B000WS4QJG|5.0|I love this CD.  However, the only problem I have with this CD is some of the remixed songs. Will.i.am turned PYT sexual and trashy and I don't feel as if Fergie sounded nice in beat it either. But I love that they included For All Time in this CD. :] And the DVD, that was great too. I never get tired of watching that Motown 25 performance.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Yes, I watch Brit's Got Talent and Yes, Susan Boyle just knocked me off my feet, (thankful that I was in a recliner when she came on).  I pre-ordered this CD and the wait was so worth it.    Her voice is so clear and easy to understand, one can sing along, the background soft as it should be to such a voice.  She seems to be such a blend, and if I say Barbara,Ella and a host of others, there are those who might fully disagree with me.  So I will say that Susan is a blend of those who's voices that I love.    This Cd is great to play in the morning, at work, in the Dentist office, at dinner and also in the evening.  It is very soothing and at times a feeling comes over me that is just a great buzz during certain songs due to the beauty of the presentation and the voice.  Now coming from a 60-70 music gal, Susan Boyle opened by style of music choice just a little bit more.    What I love most about this CD is that I bought Susan Boyle and that is what I got, her voice powerful, clear and not over powered at all by the musicians, nor the background singers which are on Silent Night
B00180R06I|5.0|\\"Vampyr\\"(1932) is Theodor Dreyer's (a Danish director) first talkie film based loosely on the book \\"Camilla\\"(1872) by Sheridan Le Fanu. Fanu's novel is notable for introducing females into the Vampire genre. The movie, though in sound, is still largely a silent picture with little actual talking and features the haunting music of Wolgang Zeller. This particular film was restored using French and German prints. There are some sequences, or images, missing from the final film, such as the one on the front cover of the Criterion box, which is part a pan shot that was later cut.<br /><br />\\"Vampyr\\" is a very atmospheric and expressionistic film that follows more the logic of dreams than reality. Shadows dance on walls, or pass on the grass, like phantoms, detached from anything real. Ghostly images of Allan Gray drift off from his sitting body walking around the grounds and the building's interiors. It has been said that the film is somewhat autobiographical and reflected Dreyer's own drifting into insanity. Soon after making this film Dreyer had a mental collapse and entered himself into a sanitarium for rehabilitation. Dreyer wasn't to make another film until eleven years later in 1943, when he made \\"Day of Wrath\\".<br /><br />This Criterion set is quite marvelous. It has a 214 page book with the Fanu's sotry \\"Camilla\\", the screenplay by Theodor and Christen Jul, another booklet with critical essays by Mark Le Fanu, Kim Newman, and Koerber, and a 1964 interview with Nicolas  de Gunzburg. There are two discs. On Disc One is the original German version with a HD digital transfer from the 1998 restoration by Martin Koerber and the Cineteca di Bologna with English subtitles and audio commentary by scholar Tony Rayns. On disc Two there is a documentary by Jorgen Roos chronicling Dreyer's career, a visual essay by scholar Casper Tybjerg on Dreyer's influences in creating \\"Vampyr\\", as well as a radio broadcast from 1958 with Dreyer reading an essay about filmmaking. \\"Vampyr\\" was only the third vampire film ever made and the second using sound,<br />preceeded only by Murnau's silent film, \\"Nosferatu\\"(1922) and Tod Browning's \\"Dracula\\"(1931).ird vampire film ever made and the second using sound,  preceeded only by Murnau's silent film, \\"Nosferatu\\"(1922) and Tod Browning's \\"Dracula\\"(1931).
B0000029LG|5.0|This is an awesome CD. I love the fact that it's two discs and the fact that the first one is pretty much his greatest hits and the second is new stuff. I love his music. He's amazing.
0714843377|3.0|I could have done without reading this book. Everyone is different and have different experiences. You can't grow unless you feel like you have lot more to do or accomplish that is worthwhile compared to where you are. This book does not help you to fill in the gap. Again this is not a criticism. It is an observation. I usually value a book when I get one piece of nformation that is useful that I can implement in my life. There are several excellent resources that may be worth your time if you are serious about accomplishing your goals in life. I will mention just two of them here by the same author. These are no his orginal ideas at the same time he is able to package it in a way that is helpful to me.  Steve Scott has mentoring program for Super Achievers and second educational material is the Richest man ever lived.  I am impressed by the material content, specificity of action plan and the program. I am able to learn and follow the steps recommended.
B002OOG6YY|5.0|This was an awesome experience! I really felt like I was at a Marilyn Manson concert. I loved to see what it looked like while he was singing. My favorites songs were The Reflecting God, The Fight Song, The Nobodies, Disposable Teens, and Sweet Dreams. Some of the things he did were funny like humping members of his band, and much more. I highly recommend MARILYN MANSON: GUNS, GOD, AND GOVERNMENT- LIVE IN L.A.!!!
B00005QGAX|5.0|I love this special edition DVD and the fact that it includes interviews and songs like Streetwalker, Fly Away, and the Spanish version of I just can't stop loving you. Fly Away is beautiful, Streetwalker has a nice beat, and he sounds so sexy singing in Spanish. ;] haha.
B002X20W2E|4.0|I don't usually download whole albums but I did and I am not disappointed.  This is a strong album.  I didn't give it 5 stars only because there is one song that's not good at all \\"G4L\\".  Maybe it'll grow on me.  It is different than Good Girl Gone Bad.  I actually think Rihanna sounds very stronger.  This is more of a Pop Album where GGGB was more dance and R&B/Pop.  This is a definitive album for Rihanna and I hope it helps her move to the next level.  I think it is GRAMMY worthy.  If it doesn't get nominated and win awards then, I don't know what but it deserves it.  GET IT WHILE YOU CAN for $.99.  Still worth full price but why not.  My favorites:  HARD, Rude Boy, Cold Case Love and Stupid.
B002NOAF9W|4.0|OK, I have to admit I saw the Stones and company perform in '69 so I may have a different perspective-- arguably one that is more accurate. Yes the set is overpriced and there could have been more material packaged more efficiently etc. but, I must take issue with the reviews I read questioning  the value of including the Stones unreleased material because they were not great performances of those songs as well as the value of including the opening acts.      In terms of the performances of the unreleased Stone's material, their rendition of Fred McDowel's \\"You Got to Move\\" and performances of the standards \\"I'm Free\\" and \\"Satisfaction\\" are just as good if not better than any of the bootleg versions I've heard from the '69 tour. The sound quality is far superior. To characterize B.B. King and Ike and Tina Turner as opening acts and some how less than worthy of inclusion in the set misses the point of the whole reason for the 40th anniversary release, that is to give the to give the listener the flavor of the \\"69 tour. B.B. King's sings powerfully and plays some stinging single string runs throughout his performance and while its arguably not as soulful and intimate as \\"Live at the Regal\\" (but what is), it is clearly one of his better live recordings. The material from Wolfgang's Vault notwithstanding. Back in the day I saw Ike and Tina Turner perform numerous times and this performance is certainly one of their better ones. After all both opening acts would no doubt be at their best performing with the Stones.        In terms of the price, wait (if you can for a few months) and purchase it used or download the MP3 for about half the cost of buying the set.
B00026WU9Q|5.0|Got to be one of the best musical albums in any genre. I could listen to \\"She belongs to Me\\" a thousand times. When I listen to \\"Maggie's Farm\\" I can hear my late brother singing the song back in our home in Coventry, England. God, that was 45 years ago! I was 15, my brother was 26 and my hero. Dylan was cool and new.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|If this wasn't a true story, you would probably think it was far fetched. I think that's partially what makes it so good. The entire time you watch you just can't believe that this happened. A missing child, the wrong child returned home & forced on the single mother, a corrupt police force determined not to be embarrassed even at the expense of a child, nobody willing to listen, a mother labeled as crazy but still unwilling to give up & the ending that leaves you both horrified & amazed. Angelina Jolie delivers an emotional performance & I can't imagine anyone else playing the part. This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in some time.
0316069906|5.0|Everyone should read this book. Vegan, vegetarian, omniovore, carnivore - everyone. If you eat, you should read this.<br /><br />I've read many books on the subject of factory farms, our health, and the food we eat. This one is by far the best. Foer didn't start out as an activist or even a vegetarian. He began researching this book because he was about to become a father and wanted to make the best and healthiest choices for his son. Because he had no preconceptions or agenda, the book is all the more honest and thought-provoking.<br /><br />Many of my omnivorous friends have told me that they don't want to read this book. They don't want to know how their food is treated before it becomes their food because it's too appalling for them to handle. They don't want to consider that by purchasing factory farmed meat, they are supporting the very methods that they find so appalling.<br /><br />The food we feed ourselves and our family each day is one of the most important choices we will ever make. Yet most of us know far more about the manufacturers of our TVs than of our food.<br /><br />As consumers, our choices drive the market. If you purchase factory farmed meat (which is almost all meat, unless you are actively seeking alternatives), then you are supporting an industry responsible for horrific animal abuse, a major contributor to global warming and pollution, and the biggest reason for antibiotic resistance and new, dangerous viruses. The government regulation in these places is slim to none. And none of this will change unless and until the consumers make the demand.
1401923119|3.0|What's wrong with this passage: \\"A Baylor School of Medicine study, published in 2002 in the New England Journal of Medicine evaluated surgery for patients with severe, debilitating knee pain. (Moseley, et al, 2002) The lead author of the study, Dr. Bruce Moseley, \\"knew\\" that knee surgery helped his patients. \\"All good surgeons know there is no placebo effect in surgery.\\" But Moseley was trying to figure out which part of his surgery was giving his patients relief. The patients in the study were divided into three groups. Moseley shaved the damaged cartilage in the knee of one group. For another group, he flushed out the knee joint, removing material thought to be causing the inflammatory effect. Both of these constitute standard treatment for arthritic knees. The third group got \\"fake\\" surgery. The patient was sedated, Moseley made three standard incisions and then talked and acted just as he would have during a real surgery--he even splashed salt water to simulate the sound of the knee-washing procedure. After 40 minutes, Moseley sewed up the incisions as if he had done the surgery. All three groups were prescribed the same postoperative care, which included an exercise program.    The results were shocking. Yes, the groups who received surgery, as expected, improved. But the placebo group improved just as much as the other two groups! Despite the fact that there are 650,000 surgeries yearly for arthritic knees, at a cost of about $5,000 each, the results were clear to Moseley: \\"My skill as a surgeon had no benefit on these patients. The entire benefit of surgery for osteoarthritis of the knee was the placebo effect.\\" Television news programs graphically illustrated the stunning results. Footage showed members of the placebo group walking and playing basketball, in short doing things they reported they could not do before the \\"surgery.\\" The placebo patients didn't find out for two years that they had gotten fake surgery. One member of the placebo group, Tim Perez,who had to walk with a cane before the surgery, is now able to play basketball with his grandchildren. He summed up the theme of this book when he told the Discovery Health Channel: \\"In this world anything is possible when you put your mind to it. I know that your mind can work miracles.\\" (Lipton, The Biology of Belief)    They missed this fact: All 3 groups got postoperative physical therapy afterwards. Therefore, it may not have been belief that cured them. Why? Because there WAS a consistent factor in all 3 groups. It was the postoperative therapy. Even the knee doctor missed this.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|I have seen the complaints from many on disc scratches and agree there's the risk with these cardboard sets. But if you can get past that, this is still a fantastic show that shines no matter how it's set up. This ranks right up there with \\"The Wire\\" and \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" as the greatest dramas never nominated for a Best Drama Emmy. But thier loss is the viewer's gain.    It's amazing to consider just how much \\"The Shield\\" changed television. Before 2001, people figured that the only way to do real hard-hitting adult dramas was pay cable such as HBO or Showtime. But \\"The Shield\\" changed that forever, making people realize you could do daring TV without needing such utter freedom as long as it worked. And it does, in every way possible. Without this show, we wouldn't have \\"Nip/Tuck,\\" \\"Damages,\\" \\"The Closer,\\" or \\"Mad Men.\\" That's more of a legacy that most shows get but it's well earned.    In one set, the series is truly a novel for television, a look at a district so riddled with crime that the cops often have no choice but to break the rules to keep order. The character shine throughout and provide a fantastic roster: A beat cop struggling with his sexuality; his partner showing how hard it is for a woman to be accepted in a man's field; a noble detective who keeps being hopefuly despite the darkness of his cases; and the captain who's willing to put his goals of political office over justice. And at the center is the Strike Team, a group of cops who regularly bribe, accept bribes, blackmail, steal and even murder while wearing the badge. Throw in season-long guest appearances by Glenn Close and Forest Whitikar and you've got sheer brilliance.    The prime reason the show works can be summed up in two words: Michael Chiklis. The actor deservedly won an Emmy for the show's first season but should have been in the running for every one after. His Vic Mackey remains one of television's most amazing characters, a man willing to do anything to get ahead but Chiklismanages the impossible: Not only making a cheating, murdering corrup cop not only someone to root for but even a sympathetic figure to boot. Half the fun of the show is seeing Vic managing to pull his schemes right under the noses of his superiors and keep on top. Yet you feel the pain he does with his family problems and more. Thanks to him, the show shines as well as it does and the actor should always be remembered for his work here.    The extras are terrific with slews of commentaries, deleted scenes and more. The box set has a good booklet on the show as well as a bonus disc of new features, such as the real-life police scandal that inspired the series. But it's the show itself that deserves attention, not just for how it changed the rules of cable TV but how it happens to be one of the most powerful, shocking, emotional dramas ever. From the first shot to the stunning finale, \\"The Shield\\" is a must-have for a fan of TV, no matter what genere you like. And if the box set isn't perfect? Well, the number one rule of \\"The Shield\\" was always how it's not a pretty world but you make your best with it.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Taking into consideration that I have read many of the reviews on here, I was not expecting much from this cd. My question to those that have rated this cd poorly is \\"WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? YOU MUST BE NUTS!!!    If you are a Whitney Houston fan, you will LOVE this new cd. The tracks are slick, sharp, and makes you either want to sing along or dance yourself silly. I am soo soo pleased to see Whitney back!! I remember seeing her in concert twenty some odd years ago, when she first began her career, and I must confess that she is still a fantastic performer and a gifted singer, even still. The last cd, I loved from Whiney, was her double disc Greatest hits cd. I am confident that many of these tracks will appear on a Greatest Hits revision or second volume. My heart breaks when listening to I LOOK TO YOU, which is bitter sweet and sincere. MILLION DOLLAR BILL makes me want to dance by myself or get down and boogie in the car. Yes, I said boogie. : ) If you are on the fence about buying this cd I say BUY IT!! Clive Davis and Whitney took a long time to produce this cd and it was well worth the wait.    Whitney Houston is still a star, still a talented diva, and can still deliver first-rate tracks. I am still a HUGE fan!!
B002C1BHIO|1.0|I can not actually believe that anyone would pay more than $10 for any HDMI cable on this planet. I challenge anyone on this planet to show me a $30, $60 or $100 cable that out performs a $10 cable. In fact, there is no scientific evidence that would even support any HDMI cable out performing another in any noticeable area. Most people buy these HDMI 1.3 cables thinking they can some how get better performance but that's simply not true. Granted, it adds support for \\"Deep Color\\" (which is an expanded color gamut) but outside of a few high-def camcorders, there aren't any sources that actually use Deep Color. There also are no current or future Blu-ray discs that use Deep Color. So people, do yourselves a favor and save some money will ya?
B002E01LLG|4.0|I really wasn't to disappointed. My expectations were low.. But I was wrong! Sweet fight scenes, and good story. I was really impressed with the PQ on this one. The audio quality wasn't amazing, but far from bad. Highly recommend wthis to anyone who has a BD player.
0679746323|5.0|Early in their book (page 13) Jung Chang and Jon Halladay include a citation from a commentary Mao Tse-tung wrote as a student in 1918 on a book called \\"A System of Ethics,\\" by 19th-century German philosopher, Friedrich Paulsen.  Mao's self-reflected, self-involved observations gives us foresight into what is to come in this excellent study.    \\"I do not agree with the view that to be moral, the motive of one's actions has to be benefiting others.  Morality does not have to be defined in relation to others ... People like me want to ... satisfy our hearts to the full, and in doing so we automatically have the most valuable moral codes.  Of course there are people and objects in the world, but they are all there only for me.\\"    The arrogance conveyed by Mao in that one quote is breathtaking.  Unfortunately, it foretells what kind of monster he became, responsible directly and indirectly for the deaths of some 70 million people.  The authors peel back the layers of decades' worth of Chinese Communist Party propaganda and untruths about Mao and we find that he was completely self-directed, that the deaths of hundreds, thousands, even millions of his fellow countrymen meant nothing to him if it furthered his ends, which was his complete and utter control of the Chinese nation.      Reading this book has opened my eyes to Mao and the founding myths of Chinese Communism, its duplicity and recurrent criminality.  It is all the more troubling when contemporary Westerners - particularly former communications director Anita Dunn and others associated with the Obama administration - cite Mao as their model, someone from whose writings and thoughts they derive personal strength and guidance.      It would be my wish that Anita Dunn et al. read this book and absorb its lessons, and then repent publicly of their adherence to this monster and his worldview.
0312370849|3.0|I was loving this book, especially the sections about Sarah and how Julia discovered her story.  Unfortunately, a little more than half-way through, when the story told from Sarah's perspective abrutly ended, the book fell flat.  While I didn't find Julia's character as unsympathetic or whiny as some other reviewers did, I found the writing to be gratuitously syrupy, maudlin and draggy.  I couldn't put the book down during for the first 150 pages, but then couldn't wait for it to end.  All in all, I would recommend the book to anyone who appreciates reading historical portrayals through personal accounts and is not familiar with the horrendous wrenching of Parisian Jews from their homes in 1942 and the complicity of the French police with the Nazis -- even if you stop reading before the last page.
B000J233SK|3.0|This is a pretty overrated album. The singer is OK, and so is the material if taken in small enough doses. Taken full strength it is dull, depressing celtic elevator music. If you must buy it, put it in your mp3 collection and 'shuffle' it in with some better music (Miriam Stockley, Grey Eye Glances, Porcupine Tree, Jethro Tull jump to mind) and it will provide a semi-nice mix, but taken on it's own it bombs. Better yet, pass on this one.
B001T9O6UQ|4.0|this book was a decent book in my opinion; however, it took me a good few chapters to get into the book.  Taking the extra ime to read it is worth it because you may not always like something when you first read it but then you enoy it and you are then glad you read it

B0026P3G12|4.0|I love Susan's voice, but it's obvious that folks are trying to change her and that's aggravating!  I don't like how 'they' changed \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" and made it end so subtly.  I think she needs to fire whoever arranged and/or produced this album, cause she is better than this!!!  They also need to quit trying to make her look and sing like someone else......she is awesome AS IS!!!  This is a Dec 2 edit.....after listening to it for days, it has grown on me and I have also come to appreciate that Susan picked these particular songs as a personal expression of who she is.  Yes, the songs are mostly ballads and yea, somber and yea, lounge like music, but just listening to the majesty of her voice is still magical and deeply touching.  Love her voice and look forward to her next CD with some new arrangers, letting her display her spunk!
B002DW92SE|4.0|Typical Nick Hornby, well written, compelling.  I liked the characters and they are well developed.  The writing style gets you sucked in right away.
B000N6TYLW|2.0|I have to say, i think that Gilmore Girls was one of the BEST series on television. Every season was refreshing and exciting, and this last season started off the same, but the end seemed abrupt and wrong. Rory and Logan's ended relationship seemed to me like the writer was pulling a \\"That Girl\\", meaning that a woman couldnt have it all, there is no reason Rory couldnt have a relationship with Logan and pursue her career. So for me, i was left a little cold at such a sorry ending for such a great show. I really hope that someday the much talked about movie comes about to fix the story!
B001GZT57W|5.0|Great movie with 2 discs!  I get it from wholesale_deals, and it did come with the package of Iron Man Mask packaging. Great deal!
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|Unlike everyone else I did not notice any of the censorship that was supposed to be in the cd. My only problem with this \\"album\\" is the fact is that they are calling this ep an album. I love this album more than The Fame it has a more darker feel to it. My favorite tracks are Bad Romance, Dance in the Dark, and Telephone. These three tracks I couldn't stop listening to. Overall Lady Gaga did a great job on her sophomore album.
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|Having just discovered Lady Gaga through her video for \\"Bad Romance\\" on You Tube, I went to my local record store (sorry Amazon) and purchased the EP. This woman is FLAWLESS!!! The record is amazing! My club days may be over but I can still appreciate good dance/techno music and Lady Gaga is at the top of her game. And even though the record is censored, I still enjoyed the songs for their frankness. I do find it funny that the songs are censored and yet the lyrics are not. I assume that fans under 18 CAN read so I don't see what censoring the songs accomplishes. And all the sites carrying the video for \\"Bad Romance\\" are playing the uncensored version. So what's the big deal? Anyways, I am very happy to have discovered this talented lady and am now a major fan. Maybe at Christmas I'll treat myself and get the deluxe version to get her first album. Gaga Oh La La!!!

B00006CXSS|5.0|I will keep this short...    We are so fortunate to have film makers like Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, and historian and writer, Stephen Ambrose, who with their vision, was able to put together this masterpiece so that the world could see just a slice of what World War II in the eyes of Easy Company was all about. This is the finest piece of filmmaking, based on historical events and real lives. Rent it or buy it, start from the beginning, I guarantee you that you will want to have the whole series for your library. Once a year, we watch from beginning to end and we are reminded of the sacrifices that so many made, so that we could be here today.
B0026P3G12|5.0|What a sweet person, who loves music to it's core.  She has even religious music on here.  Everyone will enjoy and love this album.  I love the way she is recorded.  It's pure genius.  Such clarity, and barely visible orchestration.  It's just she and the microphone.  I would have liked to see more range exhibited here, but she doesn't disappoint in proving that she is quite a great controlled singer, and that she can shine so brilliantly.  I look forward to many more of her renditions.  I now put her up there with Barbara Streisand who can sing with such feeling and magnitude.  It's a great CD to even relax to.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|A few times, when I came home from work, there my daughter would be, \\"just stopping by\\", hold up in my bedroom, watching something called, True Blood.     With little or no extra time, I shunned most anything that wasted it, especially mediocre television. I questioned her judgement and refused to watch. Ha!    Fast forward weeks later, one Saturday afternoon with time on my hands, for once. I bounced around cable television a while, and then I found True Blood. \\"I'll give it another try,\\" I thought, not convinced myself.    I kept trying to critique the first episode, and then came the second episode, and the third, and I couldn't stop watching. I was thoroughly captivated.  It seemed I'd given this crazy story enough of my time, and now I was in love with it!     Sookie made me remember how I love Southern charm, Jason made me laugh, like a dumb blond. Bill was mysterious and romantic. And Tara was kind of freaky. Sam was sweet and EVERYONE seemed to be hiding something. Each character was unique and different and nothing like I'd ever seen before. It was pure, good ol' fashion fun, with a vampire twist.     Original, and quite delicious, and a lot decedant; (I never read the books, probably not a good idea, if you are the type who relates every detail back to the book) True Blood is so scrumptious you'll be wondering why you ever thought Vampires were evil...    I think now I should have listened to my daughter. In fact, a little \\"V\\" never hurt anyone....
B001GCUNWQ|4.0|It was a fun movie for all.  I liked the first two better though.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|Watching Rome, I was reminded of how much our society needs historical documentation to remind us how the world was once upon a time. As each generation comes into their own, they too will need reminding. And over and over and over it goes. The HBO drama Rome does that for us. Magnificent,it ended only after two seasons, rather abrubtly. It was absolutely inspiring. To have the city of Rome and culture and life as it was, re-created right before our eyes was like a gift. I loved every second, every minute of it. For historians, most of it was historically correct. There were some liberties taken, but all in all, it correctly portrayed that period of time. Kevin McKidd was excellent as Lucious Vorenus and Ray Stevenson as Titus Pullo, both Roman soldiers under Marc Anthony.     I highly recommend this series to keep in your video library, to share with your family and friends about how it once was in Rome.
B00138EZIQ|5.0|I have true passion about this release. These musicians have reputations that speak for themselves, so I won't. In 1984 this was my first CD. I've subconsciously memorized riffs since I first heard the LP.<br /><br />This blending of rock, synth and jazz stylings is unmatched in my experience. I first heard the LP through a state-of-the-art stereo when it first came out --my jaw dropped. I had to know who 'Chicorreaha\\" was. At that time, I had five years of rock drumming behind me and yet I could not fathom the precision of rhythm and blending of textures. Power and grace that when I hear it played softly, it plays in my head at \\"11\\". I've heard college drum lines who would envy how tight these guys played.<br /><br />This release changed my life at 16 and continues to delight me as I near 50.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Yes, we all know by now, Dexter was adopted and watched his mother murdered before his eyes when he was three years old. We know he's a killer and by the end of this first season, we know a lot more. But it's what we don't know that makes Dexter so enticing and makes one feel just a bit guilty, like looking into a peep hole, into the deep layers of a man who must, justifyably kill the killer, administering justice. So wrong, yet so right. A man, maybe not like Superman, maybe more like Hannibal Lechter, yet we feel he's much more Superman in the end. And that's what makes us feel just a little bit uneasy when Dexter takes the knife and stabs his victim/killer and we love love love it. One of the very best well written, acted and produced shows on television.
B0017R5UA0|5.0|Believe everything you've heard, this album is fantastic! If you disagree, you just haven't listened to it enough. Honestly, I didn't think much of it at first either. A few listens...not bad, not really my thing. After 5 or 6 spins it started to click. Then I fell down this deep, dark hole and stayed there for about two months. All I heard were the haunting melodies, beautiful hooks and layers of reverb that eminate from this record. My turntable shared equal time with the Sun Giant ep and the cd didn't leave my car because all I could do was LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM! I worried I would get sick of it or see through it if I kept it up, but I was obsessed! And it never got old! It truly is a modern-day classic. There isn't a track that I don't love, but I must say that \\"Ragged Wood\\" is just heaven. Really, listen to that song, right now while you're receptive to it. Smoke a bowl or do whatever you do to relax and listen to that song. That song makes me want to live! Equally amazing, \\"He Doesn't Know Why\\". This really is the closest we will ever get to hearing \\"Smile\\", if you know what I mean. And the Sun Giant EP, while less substantial, is freaking glorious! \\"Drops in the River\\" washes over me with so many layers of emotion I feel I have reached nirvana. I can't imagine a more beautiful song.     I'm actually a pretty skeptical guy when it comes to music. It takes a lot to impress me. To say I love this album is an understatement. I AM this album! This album is the entire world!      Sidenote: The vinyl sounds wonderful, and that's another thing I'm pretty picky about. I would expect nothing less from Subpop but honestly, you never know these days. I've heard some crappy pressings come from fairly big labels in the past 10 years. If you're having a hard time choosing between cd or lp, go with the lp absolutely. Free mp3 download card too.
B002NWRMVS|3.0|I have loved Norah since her first album. I like to get on Youtube and listen to those unreleased songs like \\"Love Me Tender\\" \\"I'll be your baby tonight\\" and others.  Her first album was amazing, the second one had some high points and her third did too just fewer high points. But we still had Norah's voice which I think is her big draw. Listening to her is like laying in a warm bath with a glass of wine. Or next to a glowing fireplace. I just find comfort in that voice.  With this album I can listen to some but not all of the songs. Her voice seems to be behind the music rather than in front or even equal to it. You hear the bass and drums and have to strain to hear her voice.  So as much as I hate to do this I can only call this album average. If I heard it and didn't know it was Norah Jones I would never buy it.
B001QVGE0W|5.0|What is more hackneyed than a plot regarding corruption in municipal politics? Hard to think of anything. However, an assortment of behind the camera workers put into the hands of an excellent cast the tools whereby they were able to create a satisfying human drama. Action there is, but it does not overwhelm the story of how people deal with each other. Al Pacino sets the tone not only by his own performance but by his influence on the entire web of relationships. Danny Aiello is excellent as a political boss while the brief appearances of Martin Landau and Tony Franciosa are like the few strokes of a masters brush which firmly sketch a character. Though there are moments which seem to be diversions from dramatic logic, they are minor flaws in a good product.
1603420398|5.0|First and foremost the best part of this book is the color photos of examples! Great for getting you started on a new project, and the instructions are very easy to follow. Suitable for novices. Highly recommend!
B000TGJ8CQ|5.0|Screenwriters, Director and Nicolas Cage combine to make credible this science fiction action film, and in the process create a fine entertainment. Flash forwards become flashbacks become flash forwards, thanks to the specifications provided by the authors for the ability to see the future. Particularly clever is the gimmick that one can see the future but that the very act of seeing and acting upon what one sees can change that future. Would that Edward G. Robinson, now long ago, would have had that kind of foresight, since what  he saw occurred inevitably, despite his best efforts to avoid it (John Triton 'The Mental Wizard' in Night Has a Thousand Eyes).  Cage underplays wonderfully well, the beautiful girl he loves acts like a beautiful girl with whom he would fall in love, and the FBI team chief (as you know, they are all women now) is suitably tough and impersonal most of the time. There is sufficient action to punctuate and motivate the film but the real star remains human. All-in-all, a fast paced and enjoyable 90+minutes with no deeper significance that what you see on screen. (Note, I do mild violence in describing  Robinson's fine movie in the interests of protecting the pleasure of future viewers)
0385040253|5.0|This book is the gold standard for knots.  I could write a long review, but others have already given details.  All I would add is that over several decades it is the book I turn to for any information or directions for knots, plaits, buttons, etc.  It is all there in easy to follow format and with all variations.  There are many other books available, but if you have this one you need no other.
0385504225|3.0|Where to begin? Started off strong, a page turner, I was interested, I cared. After about midway through I was literally bogged down by the book. Get to the meat already!! Could have been shorter and the ending was a bit of a let down.     Glad I got this from the library. Waited a month or so on the  wait list, but happy I did not buy it.
B001KVZ6FW|1.0|Some versions of the UP movies which are currently on the shelves of many stores do not have English subtitles or captions for the Deaf even though this is advertised on the case.  This is not typical of Disney to distribute movies of substandard quality and to allow false advertising.    About 10% of people in America rely on English captions/subtitles to be able to follow the movies comfortably.  By not including those captions/subtitles, Disney is denying a significant market from being able to equally enjoy the high quality Disney movies.  Since the typical Disney movies are meant to be watched by everyone in the family, certain family members will be left out of the family entertainment experience.    The right thing for Disney to do now is to offer a recall and DVD replacement with the audio and subtitles which were promised on the case.  Such actions will ensure the loyalty and respect of millions of Americans and continue Disney's commitment to diversity and inclusiveness.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|I honestly felt like a foreclosure victim once the credits begin to roll. I felt a disgust, then an anger at Paramount for basically jipping me out of my money to see this garbage. Allow me explain:    1) Incredibly dull. The first 45min are a complete and utter waste of time. The audience is treated to watching a young couple argue, eat cereal, brush their teeth, and watch a Ouija board burn.    2) Too lazy to even make it look like the \\"mockumentary\\" it's tries to be. For example, a psychic visits the house and the first conversation between himself and the couple is shamelessly edited. I thought this was supposed to be \\"found\\" footage.    3) Scary? Absolutely not. It's about as scary as watching a handful of cute puppies playing with fluffy kittens. It reduces the audience to cheap parlor-house tricks: slamming doors, broken glass, and loud banging noises- yes- the kind of tripe you'll find at your local neighborhood haunted house, although this time, you'll be paying a lot more to see it.    Honestly, this film really, really shook all confidence I had in \\"professional\\" movie reviewers and movie websites. I employ people to see \\"user reviews\\" not professional critics as you'll see the great majority of the public was disgusted by this farce.     **Also, an easy way to spot the fraudulent, studio reviews is they'll read overly professional. They'll also come across as movie experts citing several older, much better films trying to compare this garbage to them. I'm no movie expert and I honestly liked Blair Witch. This is not an assault on independent films at all.**    Paramount honestly should've given everyone who went to see this tripe a complimentary gallon of vaseline - because that's how much you'll need to survive the relentless gangbang the studio gives the viewing public. I haven't the slightest doubt hundreds of interns and temp workers were hired for the sole purposes of promoting this film through the internet - targeting younger audiences through facebook, twitter and other social networking sites. It really was disgusting.    LOL. Nice try with selling this DVD. I hope someone buys every copy in circulation only to return them after watching 10 minutes of this heaping sack of excrement.
B00004W510|5.0|This is a wonderful and utterly unique record that has stood the test of time. Caution:Richard Manuel will break your heart when you hear him sing \\"Whispering Pines\\".Strongly recommended.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|I am buying this CD for my cousin in England for XMas. I've had this CD/DVD for sometime now. My sister had it before me. That was when I first heard it. I was immediately struck with the sincerity and power of it. I was over in England playing my cousin's guitar and she is a big Neil fan too. I played a number of tunes including a couple Neil Young tunes. She and I are pretty much on the same page when it comes to music even though she is an ocean and a continent away. I like that. This CD (and DVD) are tied with \\"Comes a time\\" as my favorite Neil young CD's. This CD is very refreshing especially in a time when there is so much over production and so little space in some of today's music. To hear how much beauty one voice and one instrument can have when a true artist is at work is refreshing and powerful. Neil's guitar playing is right on and beautiful. His voice also right on pitch and time, right in the groove. This is all just coming from one guy. No extra stuff or help with modern equipment. Just one guy with either a guitar or a piano and it is really wonderful.
0312370849|2.0|This novel began with a good premise and described a lesser known excerpt about the horrors of the Holocaust. However, this is a case of a good idea taking so many wrong turns as to make it painful to finish. The only reason I completed this predictable, amateurish, juvenile work is because the first part sucked me in and I kept hoping I would be surprised--A major miscalculation on my part. The majority of the book read like a youth novel; I seriously kept wondering if it had been miscataloged in the library. The following passage sums up the book perfectly: \\"His voice seemed odd, contrived.  I realized I had wanted him to break down, to cry, to show me some form of emotion. Why? No doubt because I, myself needed release, needed tears to wash away pain, sorrow, emptiness, needed to share my feelings with him at a particular, intimate communion.\\" As in the quote, the novel is odd, contrived, unrealistic; the author tries hard to manufacture false emotions without connecting the reader to the story. Do you really want to read 320 pages of release, pain, sorrow, emptiness, sharing of feelings and intimate communion all in one sentence? You would be better served by reading about the Vel D'Hiv on Wikipedia or elsewhere and using your time for more important literary works.
B001S6Y0AQ|5.0|I've seen Dave Brubeck in concert 3 times, most recently in October 2009 in beautiful Shea's Theater in Buffalo, NY.  One of Dave's sons, Matthew, even made the jaunt down from Toronto, CA to join the quartet with his cello, after the intermission.  Fantastic!<br /><br />Dave always takes the time to explain the origins of his music, and he told a few stories about the music on Time Out.  It was the first jazz album to sell over a million copies.  And it's as fresh today as it was 50 years ago when it hit the radio waves in 1959.  Enjoy the beat of Blue Rondo a' la Turk and the quintessential Take Five.  This set also includes previously unreleased live recordings at Newport and a bonus DVD that's lots of fun, too.  Go back in time with this one, then enjoy the glorious ride into the future!
B0016Q2D5M|4.0|2008's \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" is a loose adaption of Jules Verne's classic book set in modern times. Here, the story involves Professor Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser), his nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson) and Hannah, an attractive Icelandic mountain guide (Anita Briem), and their many misadventures as they stumble upon a an old mine and \\"volcano tube\\" that drops them deep into a marvelous subterranean world. Can they make it out alive?<br /><br />One glance at the poster or dvd and the viewer will instantly know what s/he is in for -- a fun, mindless adventure in the spirit of \\"Indiana Jones\\", which is understandable in view of the fact that the first Indiana Jones film ripped-off two scenes from the 1959 version of \\"Journey\\" (the 'guiding light' and huge rolling stone sequences). This 2008 rendition even features a thrilling rollercoaster-like railcar sequence a la \\"Temple of Doom,\\" although it's done better here IMHO. There's also a t-rex sequence reminiscent of \\"Jurassic Park,\\" but the oversized reptile is more cartooney here (interesting how filmmakers still aren't able to outdo that t-rex sequence a full 15 years later!).<br /><br />I won't compare this version to the 1959 rendition with James Mason, Pat Boone and Arlene Dahl since that film was made a half century ago! Needless to say, these are two totally different movies from two totally different eras. I will say, however, that it's not as long & tedious and there's no pet duck -- lol (not that I dislike that one).<br /><br />Normally I'm not into mindless \\"blockbusters\\" like this but if they're done right and I'm in the proper mood for mindless fun adventure I'm usually able to acclimate and enjoy them for what they are. Such is the case here. Brendan Fraser is the perfect actor for these types of films (e.g. 1999's \\"The Mummy); he's got that likable, benevolent 'everyman' charm. In addition, Anita Briem is easy on the eyes. It's surprising that there are only three main characters in the entire film, but they have great chemistry and you can tell they had a fun time filming; it transfers to the viewer.<br /><br />This is a family-friendly misadventure with the requisite goofy humor, which caused me to bust out laughing numerous times. I think it's better than the three Indiana Jones sequels (\\"Temple of Doom,\\" \\"Last Crusade\\" and \\"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\"). The only reason I detract a Star is my mind started wandering a bit after the t-rex sequence late in the film. Other than that, this is a highly entertaining zany adventure flick full of spunk and wonder. That said, I'm glad it only runs an hour and a half as films of this ilk should stay around the 90-minute mark so as not to risk overstaying their welcome (e.g. the three \\"Pirates of the Carribean\\" flicks).<br /><br />I also enjoyed the desolate, mountainous Icelandic locations seen early in the picture.<br /><br />One last thing: The dvd features the option of viewing the film in 3D or regular (one side or the other) and provides four pairs of 3D glasses for the former. I tried the 3D version and wasn't impressed; the 3D gimmick just doesn't do much for me and I especially dislike the dingy overall picture it offers. Needless to say, I recommend viewing the film in non-3D.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: Turn off your brain and have a blast!ire film, but they have great chemistry and you can tell they had a fun time filming; it transfers to the viewer.<br /><br />This is a family-friendly misadventure with the requisite goofy humor, which caused me to bust out laughing numerous times.

B00000AFDW|3.0|`Psycho Circus' is not the first nor was it the last fraud perpetrated on KISS fans by the firm of Stanley and Simmons. A reunion album may have turned into a great idea but Ace and Peter are little more than special guests on this LP. The album itself tries too hard to capture the glory years of the seventies with two unbelievably embarrassing songs that quality control should have prevented from appearing (I won't tell you which two because once you hear the songs (look at the titles) it will instantly be obvious. It is also that the original KISS toured in support of this record (man Ace and Peter must have been paid a ton!) since the band was not technically a band by this point. Bruce Fairbairn was less than enamored with the playing of Frehley and Criss that session people (including future KISS lead guitarist Tommy Thayer) played almost all the songs (Ace's \\"Into the Void\\" being the lone tune that all four members actually played on). The liner notes won't tell you that but how many times have bands lied on their liner notes (especially KISS!)? The title track and \\"I Pledge Allegiance\\" are decent even good KISS songs and the aforementioned Ace song is worthwhile. I also like \\"Within\\" which as one reviewer has already mentioned seems like an obvious `Carnival of Souls' leftover.  I haven't heard `Sonic Boom' but seeing how `Psycho Circus' was the last real KISS album for over a decade, I don't have high hopes. As Gene has made fairly obvious on his TV show, KISS is now more than ever a corporate brand and not a productive artistic rock band (it is hard to believe Gene made his fame and fortune as a musician, not as a carnival huckster). Longtime fans may enjoy `Psycho Circus' but then they already know the deal...welcome to the show...a true masquerade...
B001AVCFK6|4.0|If it weren't for my 11yo son I wouldn't have seen this movie. I wasn't looking forward to another Star Trek movie after the last few. Boy am I glad my son wanted to see it.    Other than a few distractions such as Spock always looking like he was smirking this movie left me wanting MORE.  After enough time to get used to the characters, even Spock about to bust into a smile was ok ;)    The story is a good one on the whole. Just don't get distracted at some key points and you can follow the plot without having to rewind it to figure out what you missed lol.    I am a big fan of the original series and TNG, and a few of the movies. This one is going to be right up there with my faves.
1433502410|1.0|Even though tracking shows the the book was delivered the designated receiver never got the Bible.  The error is probably with the Prison system.
B002UXRH10|5.0|Well, I must say that I am pleasantly surprised by this CD. I didn't want to like it because I thought it was too dark. But, after hearing the songs more it's grown on me considerably. It's a challenging CD, to be sure, as is the packaging. But as a whole, it's probably one of the stronger pop records to come along in a while. Rolling Stone called this CD \\"goth R&B\\" which is a pretty good description. Other descriptions I've heard were \\"hard-pop\\" and \\"harsh-pop\\" \\"dark-pop\\" or \\"confrontational-pop\\" (lol). It's simply pop music that is rough around the edges.    The first three cuts, \\"Mad House,\\" \\"Wait Your Turn\\" and \\"Hard\\" are like the introduction. \\"Mad House\\" is actually the invitation or warning and \\"Wait Your Turn\\" and \\"Hard\\" set the tone for a darker and more aggressive Rihanna. I wish \\"Mad House\\" was longer, actually. I liked the layered harmonious and ominous circus feel to that track. Rihanna sings \\"Come on, come on, come on in....\\" and I picture some somber and crazy looking woman standing on the front porch of a dilapidated house like \\"Fight Club,\\" (lol) motioning in a leery passerby to come join her in her house of pain.    The fourth song \\"Stupid In Love\\" opens with the line \\"Let me tell you something, never have I been a size 10 in my whole life...\\" This was a great opening and I take it to mean that she found some other girl's belonging in her boyfriend's things. The rest of the lyrics are more repetitive and simple. Overall it sounds like someone hitting themselves in the head and saying \\"Girl, you are so stupid!!! Stupid! Stupid!!!\\" There's a lot of self-loathing and regret in this one and it feels real and raw. One of Rihanna's better vocal displays.    Next up is \\"Rock Star 101\\" and it goes the complete opposite direction in that now that she knows she played the fool, she wants to drown her troubles in a wave of partying and aggression. Playing a fool for the guy in the previous song has taken a beating on her self-esteem and her \\"swagga\\" and girlfriend wants IT ALL BACK. The song isn't really rock and there isn't a guitar solo (Slash is the featured guitarist). But, it does have rock elements in the heavy, crushing wall of sound created with the synthesizers and guitar. This works nicely after the self-defeating \\"Stupid In Love\\".    Next up is the brooding \\"Russian Roulette,\\" which was a very unusual choice to kick off this project. This is a challenging song and it took guts to release it first. It seems this song is about how love is a dangerous game of chance. The use of metaphors was lost on some listeners who take everything literally, but I appreciated it.    Then there's \\"Fire Bomb\\", which is quite a lovely surprise in that it's more rock and upbeat. The tone is a bit sunnier, but the words are not. She wants to take her no good man out with her in a blaze of glory! She makes it sound almost beautiful, though. You really picture a long, hot summer road with two troubled lovers racing each other. This song is fantastic and has potential to be a radio hit.    \\"Rude Boy\\" is an upbeat song basically about quick meaningless sex. After a bad break up, some go this route. The beat is nice, but the song itself is forgettable.    \\"Photographs\\" follows \\"Rude Boy\\" and it has a pretty but soggy melody. It kinda reminds me of \\"Save A Prayer\\" by Duran Duran. I cannot stand Will.i.Am's rap part, though. So annoying.    \\"G4L\\" is a dud for me. This seems to be a fave for some because Rihanna talks a lot of smack here. I'll have to give this another listen, but it was the only song I really did not care for.    \\"Te Amo\\" is a winner! This song makes good use of her accent and the beat really makes you think of some place tropical. Beautiful song about unrequited love on a dance floor.    \\"Cold Case Love\\" is up next and it was co-written by Justin Timberlake. This is another strong cut. Loved how it continues to build, although the ending is too long. Great vocals from Rihanna and top-notch production. I can hear the ache in her heart on this track, as I can on \\"Stupid In Love.\\"    \\"The Last Song\\" closes the CD, of course, and it does so with beautiful vocals and guitars. I guess it's like she's saying this my last song about this soured love affair. I'm leaving it all on the road and now I am done. I've had my say! I kinda like the sad, airy ending to what sounds like a very passionate, tumultuous and violent ride. I am glad Rihanna decided to share the experience because it makes for a fascinating journey. I never thought Rihanna, of all pop stars, could make a CD quite like this one. It reminds me of Christina's \\"Stripped\\" in that it's a break from her usual sound and it's more personal. Janet's \\"Velvet Rope\\" is another example. \\"Rated R\\" is a more cohesive work than those CDs, however.    Much love and respect to Rihanna for not repeating herself with \\"Good Girl Gone Bad Part II\\" or trying to cover up her pain with music her heart wasn't into. She has co-writing credits for at least 8 songs that I counted and she is an executive producer as well. It is good to see someone so young taking a hands-on approach in their career! Now I look forward to songs that turn inward more and discuss what it's like to stand alone and eventually learning to open your heart again.
0316017922|4.0|A good description of how strong families & opportunities have and do affect the final outcome of an intelligent or a not so intelligent people.  Ive seen many brilliant Pakistani Drs who spent 2-4 yrs sitting and clearing USMLE exams in 90+ percentiles but were rejected visas because it were the post 9/11 era.  The anti racial comment at the end of the book is very moving
B000089RVR|5.0|I had damaged my original Dido cd and am thrilled to find a new one.
0307716988|4.0|When this book was published in 1988 I was only 11 years old. 20 years later I read this book, after the author has gone to heaven. I'm glad that this book exists. I'm glad that Michael eventually agreed for the book to be printed after a last minute hesitation about it.<br /><br />I love the book. There're many photos of Michael himself and with the people he loved and adored. There's one picture of himself that he drew , which are precious for me, a big fan. On the hard cover, Michael's signature printed in gold. He had wanted the fans to feel like they owned a signed copy. That was a nice touch to the book, and a very sweet thought of Michael as always.<br /><br />Those aside, Moonwalk let us know a little more of Michael's feelings and views. I said \\"a little\\" because I think he had reserves. He never like the idea of his life being exposed to everyone out there. The book offered him a chance to let the public know more about him but he never really went very deep of various things he talked about. I guess for someone whose privacy was literally non-existing, writing a book like this is already a big breakthrough.<br /><br />I know Michael was talented, but the book let me know just how much more talented he was. He really was born to become a \\"King\\".<br /><br />I had expected him to tell a bit more about Brooke Shield but it was just a one liner. But hey, who are we to say what he should or should not write in the book? He told of what he wouldn't mind for the public, for the fans to know. Everyone has that right. It is HIS book afterall.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|I was shocked, and dazed to find out that the reboot of Doctor Who was only going to have the spectacular Christopher Eccleston for one season. I was somewhat surprised that an actor I only really knew as \\"Barty Crouch Jr\\" from Harry Potter was going to be the new Doctor.<br /><br />Now, after the third season with him as the Doctor, I see that he was definitely the right choice for the role. He has made the role his own, with three very different companions (four, if you count Astrid Peth in Voyage of the Damned).  The Fourth Season features Donna (who was the Runaway Bride before Season 3), but old friends do return, especially but not limited to the Universe-at-Stake Two Part Finale (The Stolen Earth/Journey's End)<br /><br />We get a range of episodes--a Christmas Episode (Voyage of the Damned), a trip back to the ancient past (Fires of Pompeii), a \\"bottle episode\\" (Midnight), an episode without much of the Doctor at all (Turn Left) and much more. It's a wide ranging season, showing the range of the actors, the writers, and the show itself.<br /><br />Yes, a couple of the episodes are weaker than others, but Doctor Who has always been about the highs and lows--and fans will vociferously disagree which ones are which!  Still, I feel that the overall quality is extremely high.<br /><br />This set is perfect for the Doctor Who fan in your life--be it yourself, or someone else.<br /><br />The Full list of episodes (as spoiler free as possible):<br />1 - Voyage of the Damned--Christmas Special<br /><br />2 - Partners In Crime--The Return of Donna, and the Fight Against Fat<br /><br />3 - The Fires of Pompeii--Donna and the Doctor land in the Ancient Roman Empire. But dark things are afoot.<br /><br />4 - Planet of the Ood--We learn more about the Ood and the secret to their servitude<br /><br />5 - The Sontaran Stratagem--Martha calls back the Doctor to Earth. A good thing, since the clone alien Sontarans are up to no good.<br /><br />6 - The Poison Sky--Part two of the Sontarans plan.<br /><br />7 - The Doctor's Daughter--Fifth Doctor Peter Davison's Doctor takes the titular role. How did THAT happen? Watch and find out!<br /><br />8 - The Unicorn and the Wasp--Agatha Christie, an alien, and the answer to a real life mystery about her life.<br /><br />9 - Silence in the Library--Start of a new two parter, and the introduction of someone the Doctor doesn't know, but knows him rather well...<br />10 - Forest of the Dead End of the Two Parter as the Doctor and the mysterious River Song take on a shadowy enemy.<br /><br />11 - Midnight--A Bottle Episode, one of the best of the season as the Doctor fights an alien, and the paranoia of his tour bus companions<br /><br />12 - Turn Left--A Donna centric episode.

0066620996|5.0|In the last year I have been trying to develop the Engineering Club that I sponsor into an enduring during company.  The Book Good to Great has provided me the insight to achieve this goal.  For example, in reading the chapter on Level 5 Leadership, I realized that I have been a Level 4 Leader- the success of the organization has dependent too much on my guidance. So, I have decided to have members take ownership of their organization:  For example, the officers of the club will start running the meetings, instead of me deciding the agenda.           Also, technology does not make a great company. In fact, in the past several companies with superior technologies have not become great companies. For instance, Apple computer has always been a better machine that the PC, but it almost went out of business because it lacked a Hedgehog approach. In other words, companies that applied technology consistent with their core values increased momentum toward greatest. Thus,   incorporating the latest technology will not make a great company  Furthermore, a company's flywheel starts to move when they develop Hedgehog vision, focus in one area where they can be the best in world.  Do not expect the wheel to move fast at first, it will start slowly. For example, its hard to change the state if inertia. Yet, if you apply enough force, a company can move in the right direction.  Furthermore, once you get the flywheel moving in the right direction, each application of the force will only increase it momentum, \\"inertia in momentum.\\"
B0026P3G12|5.0|When I first saw Susan Boyle on Britains got talent, I thought, Oh wow, what a voice.  After listening to her first CD, I kept saying to myself, on each tract, OH WOW, I can't believe it took so long for her talent to be discovered.  I was stunned when I listened to that CD and the versatiltiy of her music.  Her music is an absolute treasure to the ears.  Even my 10-year-old grandson, who loves ACDC and Metallica, said \\"gramma, her voice makes my ears happy\\"!!  Need more be said?
0385342020|4.0|I absolutely loved this book! I was a bit put off by the premise, but I ended up not being able to put the book down. The characters were really engaging, and I like the 20s twist. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has enjoyed Kinsella's other books. It is similar in some respects, but very different in others. I certainly did not feel as though it was something I had read before.
B001RTCP1A|3.0|3 of 5 stars to the sci-fi movie Pitch Black. This is the second movie in the Chronicles of Riddick series with Vin Diesel in the role of Riddick. The movie opens with a passenger transport space ship starting to crash into a world (the ship had been knocked off-course). The ship is carrying Riddick plus several other passengers. The crash breaks the ship into lots of big chunks and Riddick is landed far from the main group of passengers. The world appears to be a hot dry planet (a desert) with three Suns. So, the handful of survivors seek water as their first task. Things seem to go OK until nightfall when bird-like creatures come out of hiding and start killing/eating people. The group is re-united with Riddick just before nightfall. From here the plot is simple and not too interesting: get to another part of the crashed ship to the shuttle to escape from the planet. Of course, between where they are and where the shuttle is are those birdlike creatures. You can guess most of the rest.<br /><br />If you didn't see the first movie of the Riddick series you'd have no idea who this guy is and why he has shiny eyes. The movies does little to give you any of the back-story. For that matter, in this movie Riddick is a not too interesting character and there is no development that would lead to a future story. So this is a good sci-fi movie with a very predictable plot. Yes, I do recommend it.
0618918248|5.0|Dawkins begins by telling how many atheists, while not believing, approve of those who do. They begin with, \\"I'm an atheist, but...\\" and then go on to describe the benefits of religion in others. I am a Christian and no less so after reading this book. To me, the existence of God is plain as day. I simply wasn't considering changing my views.        I was, however looking to understand where the other side is coming from-why they believe what they do. Dawkins explains his side brilliantly. I highly recommend this book. Dawkins writes with a rythmn and flow that fiction writers should envy. It was very conversational. I was afraid he would dazzle with technical terms and try to intimidate with scientific shop talk. He didn't.       I don't mean to oversimplify Dawkin's views, but a short quote will help explain why he believes God does not exist.       \\"The temptation (to attribute the appearance of design to actual design) is a false one, because the designer hypothesis immediately raises the larger problem of who designed the designer.\\"       It's the famous turtle problem, also known as infinite regression. Ultimately, we come to something without a cause and the atheists say that thing could be the universe itself rather than a supernatural being. It's a very old arguement, but still a devisive one. It doesn't resonate with me personally-I just assume we'll know when it's time to know.      One thing that stands out was Dawkins explanation of irreducible complexity. He compared the existence of irreducibly complex systems in biology to that of the arch in architecture. The scaffolding necessary to produce an arch is removed after the capstone has been placed. Dawkins applies this method, or one like it, to evolution.      Another thing that stood out for me is that we almost want our scientists to be atheists. If they are satisfied with the end of what's explainable (God did it), then they will stop looking for answers. The scientific method requires that one,at least temporarily, ignore the possibilty of a supernatural factor.       Again, I wanted to understand where they are coming from, and Dawkins explains his views very well.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Inorance is not bliss when it comes to the healthcare crisis going on in this country due to the food people eat and how it is produced in our country. Producers of our food count on the American people to remain ignorant due to lack of interest, laziness or simply choosing to turn a blind eye to this subject. Their time is limited though because people are getting tired of watching people they love die of disease and are beginning to search for answers. This movie has many of the answers contained within the information provided. It is the raw truth. It is hard to watch at times. It is even harder to comprehend that food producers, politicians, and our government whom we believe are taking care of our best interest are not doing so but instead serving their own interest - mainly for profit at the expense of health, our lives and the welfare of our country. Every person needs to watch this film - you will never be able to look at food in a grocery store quite the same way again and you will always make conscious decisions on what you choose to eat and spend your money on. I am buying a copy for every member of my family and for my closest friends.
1591841666|1.0|I read the entire book, and feel it could have been a great book if it deliver on the promise of the title of knowing when to quit and knowing when to stick with something. It does not. The Dip is about the place between the exciting new start of something, and the slump before mastery, or what Godin says \\"Being the best in the world.\\"    This book in my opinion is in the dip. It had a good start, but is far, far from being the best in the world on this important life changing subject. What the book needed badly is tools for evaluating when you should quit and when you should stick it out. This book felt like more of a rant then a serious study from an expert on the subject who has real life experience or who has worked through the process with a good number of people and learned effective tools to share with others.    It seem like Godin quit while still in the dip with writing this book. Maybe he should have followed his own advise and stuck it out and created something great, or quit before he published this book.
B001993Y2C|5.0|I can hardly recall why I started watching this show, but what a great decision that was. It is the most intriguing, smart, rewarding series that I have ever seen. I rented each disc of each season before purchasing. It is a rare show which pays off so handsomely in the finale. It is a journey to the end, but it is worth it. Like Seinfeld, the show decided to end--it was not forced to do so. As such, it ends deliberately and with satisfying closure (though the rumor is that there is more to follow).<br /><br />Much has been made of the box in which the discs are contained. Truly, it leaves much to be desired. There is a good amount of seemingly wasted volume at the center of the box, which serves only to add bulk. The discs are protected with nothing more than thin cardboard. However, with 20 discs to be enjoyed, I was never going to leave the discs in this box to begin with. A cheap, vacant cd holder works just fine. What's more, one of the purported benefits of blu-ray is the scratch-resistant coating. The decision not to utilize the native sleeves had more to do with convenience than fear of damage. As attractive as the overall package may be from the outside (that is, before noticing the scant protection), I did not purchase the Battlestar Galactica series for the box. I purchased it for the content. You should, too.<br /><br />My recommendation to you is to make a decision to experience the series. If the unfortunate packaging keeps the cost low, this is a good thing. Indeed, Universal appears to be planning a season-by-season blu-ray release. The cost of purchasing all seasons individually would multiply the cost of the collection. Also, watch the price. I purchased for less than $180, and there was no indication that this was part of any sale (and this was not through a third party seller). In other words, keep it in your wish list and when the price drops, buy it.

B002QEXN2K|4.0|John Mayer's fourth and 2009 effort \\"Battle Studies\\" is a solid album that captures the story of man dealing with recent heartbreak.  It's interesting: Mayer is usually an artist who branches out with song topics on each track, but on \\"Studies\\" each song is another form of him venting about heartbreak. The funny thing is, this concept and album hardly grows dull and actually works.  The album starts with \\"Heartbreak Warfare,\\" a great opener with a title that suggest the theme. From there, the album is a good mix of catchy tunes and a few filler tracks. Standout tracks include the first single \\"Who Says,\\" my personal favorite \\"Assassin,\\"  a Robert Johnson cover in \\"Crossroads\\" and \\"Perfectly Lonely.\\"  Like almost every Mayer album, there are a few tracks that just don't standout - but they aren't bad tracks either. \\"Half of my Heart\\" (feat. Taylor Swift) is catchy, but Swift fans will be hurt she doesn't do more than background vocals and part of the song's chorus.   Any John Mayer fan is going to enjoy this album. Is it his most inspiring body of work? No, but it's entertaining and an easy listen. Although the concept of dealing with heartbreak is strong, Mayer finds a way to do it while making the songs pretty upbeat considering the song topics. If you're looking for some new music and don't expect a classic album, try this out. It's definitely worth a listen. Mayer does a good job of entertaining his audience.
1416594787|5.0|I am halfway through this book and I must say this book is well-written and well-documented.  On page 130, Dawkins describes a move by the creator of Conservapedia when he attempted to discredit the work of Dr. Richard Lenski.  The Creationists requested the data kept by Lenski and his team and Dawkins describes the exchange between Lenski and Andrew Schlafly (editor of Conservapedia).  I went to Conservapedia and read the complete exchange.  It's quite funny.    Here's the website:      [...]    Anyway, I'm reading this book about three chapters a day and I can't wait to finish it.  I will be reading the book again to digest the information I didn't pick up the first time.    Give it a read -- if you weren't convinced before, you'll have a hard time holding on to the mindset and beliefs that caused your hesitation to begin with.
B001CU1RRM|4.0|For someone who enjoys Michael Jackson's music, but isn't a diehard fan, this is a perfect way to get your MJ collection started. Almost every Michael Jackson song from his career (ranging from The Jackson 5 days to his last album \\"Invincible\\") is found here. There are a few MJ hits that should have been included, but the songs that are on here are definitely excellent!
B001FB55I0|2.0|Terminator \\"Lite\\"<br /><br />Very mild spoiler alert...<br /><br />The title of Terminator: Salvation is a contradiction-in-terms (or a promise of false hope...), in that this Terminator film will not be the \\"salvation\\" of the Terminator franchise, for there is something lacking in this fourth installment of the Terminator series.... And that is the vision and technical expertise and guiding hand of James Cameron... TS director McG is no James Cameron...<br /><br />The first two Terminator films are modern classics-there is nothing in either film which does not contribute to the clockwork precision of their plots, which exhibit flawless logic... There is also a sense that the epic significance of the events depicted in the first two films is not present in TS-which ends with the promise of a sequel...<br /><br />This film should have been the penultimate tale of the war between Skynet and the ragtag human resistance-but it gets caught up in unnecessary subplots and implausible developments... Major characters do exceedingly dumb things in TS...There are spectacular action set-pieces alongside jaw-dropping, \\"why would anyone do that\\" stupidities...<br /><br />In this Terminator film, T-600's fight like humans... Unbelievable! Realistically, if a T-600 got it's hands on a human, it wouldn't waste time punching or throwing, it would simply and instantly kill him... Plus, there are far too many scenes in the film reminiscent of Spielberg's War of the Worlds... Especially with the \\"harvesting humans\\" sequence...<br /><br />The story told in TS is in no way original or thought-provoking or awe-inspiring-as were the first two Terminator films, in spades! The breathless, euphoric  feeling I left the theater with after the first two films was not with me after seeing TS... The climax of TS is a huge letdown, with several incredulous developments relating to the human heart... TS is a dumb film, far too dependant on frenetic, extended, CGI action sequences to mask the insubstantial, illogical aspects of it's plot...<br /><br />Christian Bale's John Conner should have been the focus of the film throughout, but he isn't... TS is essentially an ensemble film... Bale did far better work in a far superior film, with a similar dystopian theme and setting: Reign of Fire. The other characters in the film are never fully developed-especially Helena Bonham Carter as Dr. Serena Kogen of Cyberdine, who is seen in a short prolog set before Judgement Day, and then-towards the end of the film-as the face of Skynet... Why? Remember Zemeckis' Contact? McG did... I would like to have seen more of  the relationship between Conner and his pregnant wife, Kate, played by Bryce Dallas Howard-but we learn nothing more than they are quite fond of each other... The subplot featuring Sam Worthington's Marcus Wright and Moon Bloodgood's Blair Williams starts out promisingly, but quickly becomes a detriment to the film's plausibility... Star Trek's Anton Yelchin (Chekov) is quite good as Kyle Reese, the true \\"McGuffin\\" driving the plot of TS...<br /><br />For the first half or so of Terminator: Salvation I was caught up in the story being told, the unsatisfying denouement of the film brought me back to Earth... And I felt cheated yet again by another mediocre installment in a series which began so wondrously...<br /><br />Grade C.Christian Bale's John Conner should have been the focus of the film throughout, but he isn't...

B0029LHW4U|5.0|AIC is without a doubt one of my favorite bands of all time. The deep and dark sound of the music combined with the uniquely magical and ethereal voice of Layne Staley fit perfectly together. I still remember the moment when I found out Layne died. I was utterly shocked and just didn't want to believe it was true. It sucked totally, thoroughly and completely. I felt so bad for the rest of the band and people who actually knew Layne. Selfishly, I was mourning the loss of such a unique and talented singer and the band I loved. I knew AIC was dead along with Layne. No one could possibly match his voice, lyrics, and presence.    Tonight, I simply cannot believe it. It is an understatement to say that the album is amazing. AIC has been resurrected. I've only listened to the album once, but am absolutely struck by the most wonderous disbelief. I have never felt such emotion in listening to a music album.    1. All Secrets Known (5/5): I cannot imagine a more perfect opening for this album than this song. The lyrics are perfect. Jerry both describes the feelings the remaining three members of AIC feel in resurrecting the band, but is also a message to their loyal fans that they are back but acknowledging that things of course will not be exactly the same.    2. Check My Head (5/5): Now they get back to the business of AIC with an energetic, distorted, heavy and deep song that I loved AIC for, even with the old \\"oh yeah\\"s. Fantastic song. You can't really tell Layne is gone in this one. It sounds just like good old AIC.    3. Last of My Kind (?/5): Brilliant choice for the third song for the AIC fans. William takes command of the lead vocals here and it is here that the cold spash of water hit my face. Layne is dead. The instruments sound exactly like AIC, but Layne is gone. In his place is a voice that will no doubt take some getting used to. Now I'm back to thinking \\"AIC is dead\\", but at the same time, I like the song. It's simply unfair for me to rate this song right now, as the pain is getting in the way. It is a really good song though.    4. Your Decision (5/5): WOW. ...wow. I'm speechless. What an amazing song. This could be one of my favorite AIC songs of all time. Here again we hear old AIC. William's voice isn't very noticeable and it is like Layne is still here. Fantastic song.    5. A Looking In View (4/5): Not a bad song at all. Starts out dark and heavy, like good old AIC. Jerry carries the vocals here with William and again it's hard to tell Layne is gone.    6. When the Sun Rose Again (4/5): Again, not a bad song. Like the previous song, Jerry and William carry the vocals together. This works.    7. Acid Bubble (3-4/5): Not sure about this one yet. It could grow on me. I'm closer to giving it a 4 than a 3. It is different sounding and usually with time, that's a good thing.     8. Lesson Learned (4/5): Great song. Good old AIC.    9. Take Her Out (4/5): I like is one a lot. Great song.    10. Private Hell (4/5): This is a great song and is a strong 4 leaning to 5.    11. Black Gives Way to Blue (5/5): I'm left speechless and emotional by this song. Again, WOW. ...wow. This song is an incredibly powerful eulogy to Layne. If anything, it's much too short, but I can understand that, as I could imagine being in Jerry's place and not being able to sing this song for very long without getting overcome by sadness. It is a perfectly respectful tribute to their lost friend.    12: Black Gives Way to Blue (5/5): Same song as number 11, but with Elton John on piano. Amazingly beautiful and respectful. Thank you so much Elton for adding such beauty to this song. It's very hard to listen to this song without becoming emotional.    13. Your Decision [Live] (5/5): Same song as number 4 and done beautifully live.    In closing, after listening the the whole album for the second time, I am very close to saying that this may very well be my favorite album of all time for so many reasons. Jerry, Mike, and Sean along with William have successfully pulled off what I thought was absolutely impossible. Yes, this album didn't have a deep and dark \\"Angry Chair\\", which I loved, but this is a somber album for very understandable and respectful reasons. I cannot wait for the upcoming concerts in March, which I will most likely see in both Chicago and Minneapolis, to say nothing of more albums and songs from Alice in Chains. Thank you so much AIC, not just because you guys didn't frak this up, but also for a stunningly, incredible comeback.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This woman is truly blessed and is being used in a MIGHTY way to inspire  all who look about and find it hard to hope.  It's about all who have tried,  all who have faced insurmountable obstacles, all who have seemingly failed &  all who have been on the verge of giving up, but moved on in faith.    I pray she always maintains some aspects of faith in her songs.  RARELY do I get an album and like EVERY SONG, even songs I never cared much for  before. When Susan sings them, you feel your soul stir and your gratitude rise.  PERFECT for a Thanksgiving timed release!  She truly is a bright beacon of light  and faith in an otherwise dark and dreary world.
B002Y4KWS0|2.0|I've been downloading the new show and watching it like everyone else here, and I have to say that this Stargate offshoot is different.  I think the writer and directors wanted a darker Stargate show that set it apart from all the others, but in doing so they have a plot line that seems to get darker, bleaker, and in many ways more frivolous, and pointless.<br /><br />I am doing my best to continue to watch the show, and I have high hopes that they will somehow swing things back into alignment with the Stargate shows of the past because this new group of people, stuck on that ship they can't control, and the powerlessness of all the crew leaves very little room for a decent plot, or a story.  I seriously doubt that there will be a season 2.

B001P06GX4|4.0|If you want a great game to play with friends and family, this is great. Very good for people who are good at spatial problems and like Tetris. Its competitive, but not overly so, and pretty addictive. We tried the 3D and it was not as fun as this - basically you take shapes and put them corner to corner on the board and try to place all your pieces while not letting the other players place theirs in your area. Try it at your own risk!
B00009W0U4|4.0|Remember watching the imfamous flogging scene and thinking: \\"Hmm, this couldv'e been about seven minutes shorter.\\"?  That pretty much applies here.  Granted, I understand and even applaud Gaspar's decision to expose the ugliness of rape and revenge, but there is a such thing as overstating your case.  Make no mistake, this is not PORN.  Alex doesn't resist her attacker in the beginning, only to change her mind the middle, and then have a screeching orgasm at the end.  No, this is more like OZ.  It's brutal, animal and sadistic.<br /><br />In fact, this movie's first act is so jarring with it's graphic (and in most cases DEVIANT) depictions of sex and violence, it can leave you with a dizzying sense of vertigo.  I think that was the idea behind the spinning camera at the beginning; which is another technique that was overdone.  I think this was to prepare you for the goings-on in the Rectum nightclub.  As if the name itself wasn't an indication!<br /><br />Now for me, the saving grace of this film is the second half.  It's just...wonderfully done.  I'm sure by now you've read the many reviews that tells you the film is being shown in reverse order.  With that in mind, you have this image of such horrible violence, and yet it's tempered by these three characters that jump out at you.  They're not the victims or beserkers that you see at the film's opening.  They're just regular thirty-something people out having a night on the town.  As the film draws you closer to the end (well, beginning), you almost ALMOST forget what's about to happen.<br /><br />I was very impressed by the format and storytelling here, and that's the main reason I gave it four stars.  I've never seen this done before, and was surprised at how well it worked. I don't think this was an exploitation peice (although it really did straddle the fence there).  I think it was just three good people that suffered a horrible misfortune and reacted to it in a very believable way.  I think it's important enough for a single viewing, but I wouldn't recommend it for your collection.  It's REALLY brutal.  Enjoy and Be warned.iewing, but I wouldn't recommend it for your collection.  It's REALLY brutal.  Enjoy and Be warned.
B002LE8EFQ|5.0|This first album by Susan Boyle is purely and simply an opportunity to enjoy her beautiful voice. What makes it even more special is the fact that her star quality has not been created through marketing dedicated to those who were blessed with perfect boney structure or a fabulous figure. Her \\"to be someone\\" as she promised her mother resulted from the blessing of a voice like an angel. Her humility appeals to me on a level of no other \\"super star\\". I hope she is able to remain \\"just Susan\\", dream her dream and enjoy a long and successful career sharing her beautiful voice with us. If she can, I will be there to support her.
B001VPJYZK|4.0|I'm a Desperate Housewives lover, so I liked the video. My only issuee is that for some reason, they had a lot fewer new episodes last year, but still charged the same amount for the video. The cost should be in line with the number of new episodes received. I guess as with everything else....it's the almighty dollar that rules the world.
0312370849|5.0|Sarah's Key was a gripping and powerful book. It revealed to me a part of Holocaust history that I had never heard of before- the Parisian roundups conducted by the French themselves. At first I was annoyed by Julia's modern story, it was too lightweight compared to Sarah's, but it all tied together in the middle, and I really connected with her. It's a novel I want to keep on my bookshelf and share with my children someday.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I like this series alot and when it first came out i just kind of ran into it on the tv but i am glad i did. It is packed full of swords and magic. Craig Horner is terrific as well as his co stars. Enjoyable and I look forward to seeing where the series goes from here.
630469654X|5.0|This is a good movie to watch with your spouse or sweetheart. It's romantic without going too much in that direction while the action scenes are exciting without dripping gore. My teen-aged kids saw it for the first time and they liked it as well.  I wouldn't recommend it for really young kids,they probably wouldn't understand it anyway, but it's definitely one I would recommend for a family home movie night
0385504225|2.0|I skimmed the last couple chapters just to \\"finish\\" the book.  In reflection I feel this was written more for the money than for the reader.  I have read and enjoyed all of Dan's other books, but this was a big disappointment.
1401322425|5.0|First: I never write product reviews.  However, after eating delicious meal after delicious meal thanks to this cookbook, I just had to offer my accolades to the list.  My husband and I love to cook.  We love to try new recipes at least a couple of times each week.  EVERY meal that we have tried from this book has been great.  Mushroom risotto? Yum. Italian bread and cabbage soup? Amazing. Essex fried rabbit? Delicious.  Indian carrot salad, steak and Guinness pie, rhubarb fool...aaahhh.  These are just the recipes that I'm thinking of off of the top of my head -- I know I'm forgetting many other stellar ones that we've tried.  This might be the best Christmas gift I've ever received.  Also, the gorgeous photography and interesting discussions on gardening and sustainability make it an interesting read as well.  I highly recommend this book.
0385532458|5.0|This is a book I couldn't put down.  An excellent read and I highly recommend it.  This would be a great book to read on a plane.  Not too heavy and exactly the light reading I enjoy when I travel.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|My friends, the Blu-Ray version of this film is nothing short of outstanding. Watching it recently, I could count the hairs on the actors' heads in some scenes. That's how crystal-clear the video is. It could have been filmed yesterday.<br /><br />The backgrounds have been rendered exceptionally well. In one scene, George is standing in the office of the Building and Loan, gazing at a portrait of his father on the wall. Under the portrait is a paper containing a quote, presumably one of his father's. I won't spoil it here but the quote can be read clearly by the viewer. In none of the previous releases of this film (VHS, DVD) has the clarity of the video been so well rendered.<br /><br />The Colorized version is a big improvement over previous releases as well. The colors are vibrant and bright. In previous releases the colors (or what there were of them) were dull and faded in appearance. The BR release is a welcome change from those earlier versions.

1439138311|5.0|Brooklyn presents brilliant characterization OF Eilis Laccy. We can see how this character transformed from the shy, innocent Irish women to a strong woman.   She is really a life like character. Author has very artistically and beautifully created her surroundings in Ireland. He perfectly narrates development of Elis in the new environment. Several changes take place in her life as the novel moves ahead. We see the confusion and homesickness of a young girl. Author has documented Eilis's gradual transformation from girl to woman. Eilis herself does not know what he wants. She has to face various odd situations. Sometime lack of decisiveness creates problems for her. Really it is so well written that reader can easily find himself immersed in the setting.  Colm Toibin has done a commendable work. In so few words he tells a lot about major and minor character. With the help of his skills he brings to life the character of Eilis. Really it deserves 5 stars.
0762434279|1.0|This book is excellent... but the copy they sent me is so tiny! I am not happy and very upset. Make sure when buying this book you don't get ripped off like I did. It's so small I can't even read it. I hope I can at least get a refund?

B001GCUO1Q|3.0|The Canuck who goes \\"snikt\\" is back and in his own feature film, and my tepid reaction goes along the lines of \\"Um.. oh.. huh.\\" X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE is serviceable enough, but in no way does it elevate the X-Men film franchise to new heights. There's always peril in disclosing a character's mysterious past, that the doing of it may possibly sabotage the character's existing appeal. Sometimes, things are better left alone, better left to the viewer's imaginations lest the reality not live up to all the fun speculations. In having long-withheld details from his murky past finally revealed, Wolverine ends up being less interesting. And the big, exciting reveals end up not so big, not so exciting. For a vehicle featuring a mutant berserker who's the best at what he does - which is fighting - X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE lacks punch.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman isn't bad as Logan. Okay, I had to get over the fact that Logan in the comic books stands at only 5'3,\\" and not 6'2,\\" which is Jackman's height. Because, for me, part of Wolverine's appeal is that he's often the smallest runt in the place and still he tears  up the shizzy. Another thing is that Jackman doesn't quite convincingly demonstrate that utterly berserko rage that Logan succumbs to. So, not feral enough, vicious enough, scruffy enough, or, yeah, smelly enough. Hugh Jackman isn't bad as Logan. But he's too, I dunno, elegant? Tame?<br /><br />The film begins somewhen in 1845, which is when young James Howlett's (Wolverine/Logan's real name) mutant abilities first truly kick in. We note James' popping of his retractable bone claws, the tragedy in his home, the panicked dash thru the woods, the show of togetherness by Victor Creed, James' older half-brother, and then we're off to the opening credits to catch brief glimpses of James and Victor adventuring thru various wars down the decades. Thru the years Victor (a very good Liev Shreiber) becomes increasingly bestial and amoral and you could see James growing more and more concerned about this. It was never gonna end well between the two. If you read the X-Men titles, you know this, that Wolverine and Sabertooth are the bitterest of enemies.<br /><br />In telling Logan's story, the movie skips key junctures in his past, or since this is the movie version, maybe Logan simply never did venture to Madripoor or get married in Japan. During 'Nam, we do see him and Victor being handpicked by Colonel Stryker for Team X, a black ops unit peopled with hardened mutants. We witness Stryker's interest in the rare metal alloy known as adamantium, and we fans know how adamantium impacts Wolverine later on. The movie cherry picks (and sometimes throws a curve on) elements from the Wolverine mythos. We follow Logan as he encounters Silverfox and later undergoes the excruciatingly painful Weapon X experiment. The film peppers in various superhero scuffles as Wolverine and Sabertooth separately throw down with various mutants, all this culminating in a showdown on Three Mile Island. But the disappointing thing is that most of the action sequences don't get you up as they should.<br /><br />I get the sense that Gambit and especially Deadpool were spotlighted with eventually having them star in their own movies in mind. Except that Taylor Kitsch underwhelms as Remy LeBeau. On the other hand, Ryan Reynolds as the mouthy merc Wade Wilson is very promising. Ryan Reynolds is at his scene-stealing best and, in one scene, as Wade Wilson furiously deflects bullets with his flashing swords, he solidifies himself as the baddest dude in a roomful of bad dudes. So I'm sold on the Deadpool movie. Actually, that whole sequence in which Team X invades a well-defended structure in Lagos, Nigeria counts as the most scintillating action sequence in the film. However, what they later do to Deadpool is just too much. I also wasn't down with the out-of-left-field reimagining of Blob. A fun thing, though, is that I once again get to play the \\"Identify that Cameo\\" game. Most prominent are a young Cyclops and Emma Frost. But see if you could pick out the others.<br /><br />The movie gives us a momentary glimpse of Logan being happy, the operative word being \\"momentary.\\" We see Logan suffering a tragic loss and giving in to his inner rage and losing his inhibitions. And yet, as portrayed by Hugh Jackman, when Wolverine loses it, in my eyes, he doesn't lose it enough. The PG-13 rating may also be to blame for this. Word is that a sequel is already underway. I'm crossing my fingers for an Alpha Flight sighting.<br /><br />Lastly, Wade Wilson just cracks me up. Mouthy as he is, he doesn't really get a chance to mouth off. However, he does manage to get on Sabertooth's bad side when he observes that Sabertooth has the \\"fingernails of a bag lady.\\"ame. Most prominent are a young Cyclops and Emma Frost.

B0000025KI|5.0|1980. Like today, our country was in the grip of economic recession, rising unemployment and political unrest. Obscured by the Reagan myth, the years that followed the \\"Reagan Revolution\\" worsened before they improved, as manufacturing jobs fled overseas, devastating the communities they left behind. Released in October of that year, 'The River' reflected the mood of a country reeling from sweeping changes.     Musically, this is the album where the E Street Band hit its stride. After a year+ of finding their trademark sound and chemistry on the \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\" tour, the band headed back to the studio to record 'The River.' What makes this album great is Bruce, Steve Van Zandt & Jon Landau's attempt to capture the raw, visceral impact of the band's live show in the studio. Thus, most of the music was recorded together, as a band, with minimal overdubs. It's a messy, compressed mix--like it was made for A.M. radio, where 'Hungry Heart' became a hit--but it had an immediacy that no other Bruce album had before or since.    From the unabashed exuberance of 'I'm a Rocker' to the resigned desperation of 'Stolen Car' the album covers the emotional waterfront. Stylistically, The River draws from Bruce's & (especially) Steve's encyclopedic knowledge and rock & roll and R&B but gives a nod to contemporary influences as well, such as in the bashed-out punk rock spirit of 'Crush on You.' The country influences (i.e. Hank Williams, Roy Acuff) which play an even greater role on Bruce's follow-up album, 'Nebraska' begin to find their place on tracks like 'Cadillac Ranch' and 'Wreck on the Highway,' the latter borrowing lyrical imagery from Acuff's classic song of the same title.    20 songs in all, The River contains many of Bruce's finest moments and points the way to the blockbuster album that he would release 4 years later. 'Born in the USA' may be the better album, but The River will always be my favorite. To me, the emotional center of the album occurs at theend of 'Independence Day' when the protagonist says to his father in farewell, \\"Papa, now I know the things you wanted that you could not say...I swear I never meant to take those things away.\\"     'The River' is a testimony to fragility of the ties that bind us together. We struggle to find security and subsistence for ourselves and our families, but too often our efforts are undermined by forces beyond our control. 'The River' is an elegy to those who placed their faith in the American Dream. A dream deferred.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This is her first CD.  Wow!  Some of the songs made the hair on my arms raise.  She is so utterly talented and there is such a sweetness to her songs.  But her voice:  the heart and soul in her voice.  She hasn't even come into her own yet.  I can't wait to get her next album.  She is so lovely on the cover and she left comments on each song.  What a talent she is.  I am so looking forward to attending a live concert and more music.  I am also a fan of Sarah Brightman, Elaine Paige, Andrea Bocelli, Josh Grogan and Il Divo and of course the Great Pavorotti.  I am going to be a fan of hers for a very long time, enjoying her watching and seeing her growth as a performer as time goes by.  This CD will be a favorite when I travel, while I am at home.  She is so versatile.  And with her angelic voice, she can really bring on the gospel music.  I am so thrilled.  I am happy to be one of her fans.  I feel so fortunate to have a copy of the CD so quick.  I love her and she makes me feel so good when I listen to her music.

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Few Movie companies have as good a track record as Pixar. With better story lines than most Hollywood dramas, Pixar never fails to impress and most of the time astound! 'Up' is a beautiful looking film with a very emotional theme and is probably a little too adult for the younger kids. Pixar leaves out the wisecracking side characters and adds depth to the story of an old man who loses his life partner and must find a way to keep on going. He decides to complete one of the many adventures he and his wife had planned for so many years, but like many of us never seemed to get to it. Yes!, it does sound a little too deep for an animated film, but animated films have come along way and if this is the direction they're headed that's fine by me!<br /><br />The film has some of the most impressive animation ever done and the characters are, well.....almost real! Pixar hasn't really had a bad film and this is certainly among one of their best, but with winners such as Wall-E, Finding Nemo and Ratatouille, I'm not sure if this slightly downer is going to become a film to watch over and over again. Don't get me wrong, this is a fantastic film and deserves a heap of credit trying to follow Wall-E, but with such an emotionally adult theme, I'm not sure who this film is targeted for?<br /><br />The 4 disc Blu Ray is loaded with interesting extras and the usual standard DVD, digital copy blah, blah, blah, and is certainly one of the best Blu Ray releases I've seen so far. 'Up' is not always as \\"up\\" as it should be, but it is one of the most beautiful and poignant films I have ever seen.
0743487486|4.0|Alfie Kohn deserves recognition for his extensive research, not just for his own spouting opinion, how to become better parents, as reflected in Unconditional Parenting. I agree with the concept that children should be motivated intrinsically rather than extrinsically. Namely, children should behave properly and study industriously for their own good rather for material rewards or fame. Our sages said, thousands of years ago: \\"Study and do good deeds not in order to get a prize.\\" On the other hand, I am averse with Kohn's quote of a study claiming that discipline applied to children is based on either power or love \\"Power-based discipline includes hitting, yelling and threatening. Love-based discipline includes everything else.\\" To my understanding, discipline basically means listening (for example, the Hebrew term for discipline is mishmat = the root is to listen) \\"Hitting, yelling, offensive ordering and threatening\\" are not necessarily a part of discipline.<br /><br />Caring for and being attentive to a child's interest and needs is true love. All parents, other than some abusive ones, love their children and obviously wish to see them happy as kids and eventually be happy as adults. Disciplining a child does not imply that that the parents no longer care for their child. I agree with Kohn that the level of love should not be contingent on the child's behavior. Caring for the child should indeed be unconditional. However children must be disciplined. Parents' life experience had taught them, at a high cost, how to act, behave, and avoid pitfalls. It is the parents' duty to convey those lessons to their offspring. The fifth Commandment reads\\" Honor your father and mother so that you may live longer\\" This Commandment, given by God or written by man (whatever you believe in) is compelling. Nowadays, we are able to produce computers or travel to the moon. Our technological sophistication can not intrinsically ignore the wisdom of sages who lived thousands of years ago. Children that are implanted with the seeds of respectability for parents, elders and teachers do thrive.<br /><br />I was born 83 years ago in a small town in Poland. My father was a strict disciplinarian. The standard of living in those days would be categorized today to be below poverty level. Still, children seemed to be happier then than they are today. I never heard about kids committing suicide. I did not see teenagers killing themselves even during the Holocaust. Nowadays, many youngsters, enjoying personal freedom, where \\"love and reason\\" prevail, kill themselves. Some parents and teachers are being assaulted and randomly even murdered, by children where the \\"love and reason\\" is the norm at home. My great-grandparents had twenty eight children. In the absence of indoor plumbing, disposable diapers, telephones, refrigerators, cars etc. it was obviously more difficult to raise children then than it is today. Parents had no time to apply reason or persuasion dealing with their kids; parents' word was the law. It seems that the children raised themselves by observation. They noticed the deferential esteem manifested by their parents towards their parents' parents. Children inhaled the aura of deference for parents and grandparents. I remember my father visiting his ailing mother every day. My stepmother was an avid reader. \\"There must be something good about it\\" my brother commented. The older I get I am more appreciative of the values instilled me as a child, via disciplinary methods. My parents' principles were my beacon in time of darkness. My strong desire to be reunited with my extended family kept me, as a teenager, striving to survive three years of captivity in concentration camps in Nazi Germany. My empirical life had convinced me that even grown children will only gain by being \\"disciplined\\" by listening to their matured parents. Our sages said, thousands of years ago: \\"Who is a wise person? A wise person is the one that learns from his experience,but the wisest person is the one that learns from somebody else's experience.\\"  Nowadays, we are able to produce computers or travel to the moon. Our technological sophistication should not intrinsically ignore the wisdom of sages who lived thousands of years ago.<br />Dr. Benjamin McLane Spock (1903-19998)  in his book Baby and Child Care, published in 1946, urged parents to be more flexible, to be permissive parents whereas the previous conventional wisdom had been that child rearing should focus on building discipline. Some critics had later blamed him for negative results. Fifty yers later, in a TV interview, Dr. Spock himself said that if he would have enough time left he would have revised many of his early theories about permissive parenting. Alfie Kohn may reach to the same conlusion when he reaches the age of 93. My wife, at 25, was a follower of Dr. Spock, as many mothers were in the 60s. She and I could have done better parenting of our young children by utilizing the methods and wisdom of our authoriterian parents. Our grown children, like all grown-ups could have gained a lot if they would have been disciplined, listend to their aging parents.<br /><br />Alter Wiener, author From A name to A Numbererson is the one that learns from somebody else's experience.\\"  Nowadays, we are able to produce computers or travel to the moon.

B001GCUNWQ|4.0|I know a lot of folks thought this wasn't the best in the series, but when is a third sequel the best in a series? 'Ice Age Dawn Of The Dinosaurs' is a fun movie with plenty of eye candy and heart. It may not be the best, but its a worthy edition to the franchise. The animation is beautiful, they have retained the original voice cast, the Blu Ray is loaded with interesting stuff and sports a sweet transfer. What's not to like? If you like animated films, this one should be in your collection.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I, like many people, have been leaning toward preferring organic and natural.  I'm not sure if my principles were weak or what, but I found my dedication toward this way of eating fading over time; I often thought, \\"well, what's the point, almost everything in our environment is toxic anyway...there's no point in even trying to eat healthy.\\"  However, this film revitalized my interest.  It was refreshingly disturbing at times, in terms of the treatment of animals and the food corporation's treatment of farmers and workers.  I only wish there was a booster dose available every so often, just in case I lose my determination to do better for my own body and our society as a whole.

B002QEXN2K|4.0|\\"Room for Squares\\", John's refreshing debut had its major label release only days after Sept. 11th. John had already begun building a treasured organic buzz at South by Southwest by its burgeoning new label, Aware Records, out of Chicago via an EP, \\"Inside Wants Out\\". It was one of those rare times when a marketing launch could not be more perfect. \\"No Such Thing\\" touched a sentiment in me and hundreds of thousands of others with its salute to one's memories of puberty, teen angst and youthful exuberance. There was nothing particularly outstanding about the album, it was just a simple little minor masterpiece that would grow on me over time. I became one of its most vocal proponents and told almost anyone that I thought would enjoy a new refreshing and honest debut, \\"Room for Squares\\" rates as one. It was just a solid collection of songs that immediately reminded me of my first listening of \\"Sweet Baby James\\". And again it had earned that much sought after, elusive, \\"organic buzz\\".........a must have, as dictated by the \\"cool\\" inner circle of music lovers.  At the time, i saw a lot of potential in John. Good songs, good voice and a good look. 4 millions albums later, \\"Room for Squares\\" brings John the first of many Grammy awards for the soulful, pop \\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\". That album stayed on the charts for 2 years.  He would sidestep the sophomore jinx with the surprisingly r&b leaning, \\"Heavier Things\\". I remember streaming an advance listening on MTV's site and immediately surrendering to its opening number, \\"Clarity\\". That track would become a personal fave. John was also quite prolific, releasing several live digital only albums from his first headlining tour (He had already stolen Norah Jones thunder as her opening act in, support of \\"Room for Squares\\". Those dates would be captured under the banner of \\"As Is\\". On some nights he would open with \\"Clarity\\" and other nights, it would be a near closer......but, it would always remain a crowd pleaser, openeror closer. At the tail end of that album, \\"Daughters\\" would infuse the album with one more commercial jolt and his 2nd Grammy. An official live album, \\"Any Given Thursday\\" would be released on CD/DVD and proved a testament to his power as a touring act. He would transform his pop/folk songs into hot urban jams that soldified his mass appeal.  So after multi-platinum albums like \\"Continuum\\", more Grammy awards, a credible turn into the Blues with the Gold, \\"Try\\" Live! album.......John was indeed ubiquitous. A columnist for Esquire magazine, a mini-series on TMZ, a leading Tweeter and courtships from Bravo and other networks about different projects............you have the makings of the first Mega Star of the Millennium. His matinee good looks appeal to both men and women alike, hip hoppers and teeny boppers.  So here comes his 4th studio album, \\"Battle Studies\\" with its stunning photography by Albert Watson (Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Christy Turlington, Kate Moss, etc.) and art direction template  from Columbia Records 60s album covers. The first single, \\"Who Says\\" has not crashed onto radio playlists, save for Triple A, where it has at least hit the summit. \\"Who Says\\" most assuredly doesn't sound like the kind of song that more reactive Rhythmic or even Top 40 stations are currently rotating. John's music doesn't sound like this at all. But he somehow lingers around. His warm persona, a geat musical diversity that is noteworthy, entertaining heartthrob/major hottie antics aggregate to yet another #1 album that one suspects has a few Grammy nominations and awards due it.  \\"War of My Life\\", \\"Heartbreak Warfare\\", a cover of \\"Crossroads\\", \\"Half of My Heart\\", All We Ever Do Is Say Goodbye\\", \\"Perfectly Lonely\\", \\"Edge of Desire\\", are solid copyrights from an artist who beckons to me what James Taylor would possibly mean to today's audience........James was soulful in his vocalizations, James had the hippie's respect while still getting on to Top 40, John has the hip hoppers while still getting on Mainstream Top 40, both are/were major hot el  artisto sensitivo and both gentlemen sell a minor massive quantities of their music. This one works. Mazel Tov, Otra Vez, Monsieur Mayer.

B001UV4XUG|5.0|If you want a comprehensive review, look below, I just want to say that this movie is great.  The story shows how love has its ups and downs, and much like real life, things don't always turn out as you would hope.  That being said, I am extremely happy I saw this movie and that it didn't fade into the background. I recommend it for anyone who likes a good story, a great soundtrack and some beautiful cinematography.
B00288KNLS|1.0|Ok.  I am going to get lambasted by other reviewers I am sure.  However, I write this brief review as a parent of two girls (3 and 9) and not that of a self-purported film critic.  THIS MOVIE IS DARK.  I mean dark in a manner beyond mere creepy at the 9 year old level.  This movie caused my 9 year old to start crying about half way through.  My 3 year old wanted nothing to do with it about three minutes into the opening scene and left the room.  She was apparently smarter than me.  I had to stop the movie immediately when my 9 year old started crying.<br /><br />The opening scene alone was designed in such a manner I associated the scene with a movie about a dismembering serial killer or filicide (killing of one's own child). However, I dismissed these thoughts as being overly protective or analytical.  Big mistake on my part.  I should have trusted parental intuition and I would caution you to do the same.  Watch the movie yourself before you let your children near it.<br /><br />Following our termination of the movie, I talked to my 9 year old about the movie for 10 minutes trying to prevent her from internalizing her feelings.  She had issues with the opening scene as well but did not say anything.  Her opinion is that the movie opened in a dark way but then became \\"pleasant.\\"  However, at the point where the parents were insisting they would sew buttons into the eyes of their child she believes the movie was portraying \\"something evil\\" (her words).  The music is also noticably morbid in my humble opinion.<br /><br />Then again, I could be wrong.

After having the headset on for more then 10 minutes it started hurting my ears to the point where I had to take it off and run sound through my external speakers. Also the sound from these aren't that great with a lack of bass. I'll be returning them and trying out either the Fatality headset or Razar's offering. I'd advise people with bigger heads to stay away.

Whatever Cusack dishes out, Driver throws right back. As with many of his (or her) movies, Cusack's sister, Joan Cusack, is also cast in this movie. This movie will end up in the \\"classic, must see\\" section of movies soon! Don't wait till then to buy it!
B001OQCV24|5.0|How did the Mayans know that the world would end in 2012?  What made them so smart?  These questions remain unanswered, on screen just as in life, but for goodness sake, what does it take to make you guys give up five stars to a movie?  This picture has everything, and then it has everything else piled on top of it like a big yummy sundae dripping with chocolate sauce and nuts.  We went on Thanksgiving Day, traditionally the one time in the year when fifty percent of the audience is sleeping off a gigantic meal, yet this time around, people were screaming in terror and wonderment.  Screaming and pounding their fists on their seats and clutching their neighbors even if you didn't know them from Adam.  At that point none of us were worried about the likelihood of a Mayan prediction.  The screen told us what was happening...  the world was suffering from Earth Displacement...  the inside of the earth became a microwave...  Yellowstone Park turned into a volcano.  There haven't been too many good movies set in Yellowstone Park but let me tell you, those scenes there are unbelievably tense.  I wonder if Yellowstone will suffer a dip in tourism because after seeing 2012, you'd have to be crazy to visit there, just in case the Mayans were right!<br /><br />John Cusack stars as a novelist whose book Farewell Atlantis has some eerie parallels with what's happening right underneath his feet.  They never do explain why his book is so similar to the events of 2012, but I fogured that maybe he had a little Mayan predictor-y blook in him.  What happened to Cusack?  He was never an Adonis, but now it looks as though someone had punched him in the mouth at birth.  What a mug, and yet, he underacts his way through a part which another actor might have botched utterly.  There are scenes where he and Amanda Peet are trying to comfort each other and give the other one strength that are really beautifully done, but what's weird is that Peet, who has gone through the same ordeals as Cusack or nearly, still has on every mg of her makeup on and her expensive haircut still lovingly teased into just the right suggestion of earth-ending anguish, while Cusack just looks like hell.  Maybe the audience wouldn't stand for it to see him with a plain woman, or even an average woman.  Well, more power to the star system!  On the black side of things, we have Thandie Newton utterly exquisite as the art consultant daughter, Laura, of the US president, Danny Glover, and she meets cute with a top geologist called Adrian (Chiwetel Ejiofor), and they are pretty evenly matched according to looks.  Glover plays the US president as though he were shellshocked going into the movie, with touches of Reagan's last days of dementia.arly, still has on every mg of her makeup on and her expensive haircut still lovingly teased into just the right suggestion of earth-ending anguish, while Cusack just looks like hell.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|Great sound quality. Sure it could have been better if it was remixed but it's a lot better then the un-remastered versions.
B001Q2RXJC|5.0|When Saxon entered Rampart Studios in February of 1980 to record their breakthrough LP (and second overall) \\"Wheels of Steel,\\" the NWOBHM was just starting to really unfold, and would arguably peak later that year, with debut records being released by the scene's top contenders, most notably Iron Maiden, Def Leppard, Diamond Head, Tygers of Pan Tang and Girlschool.    With the exception of Iron Maiden, none of those groups however, not even Def Leppard, would chart that year as high as these working class boys from Barnsley.  With the strength of singles from the record such as \\"747 (Strangers in the Night)\\" and the title track, \\"Wheels of Steel\\" actually at one time reached #5 in the U.K. national charts.  Astonishing, especially for an independent, underground recording from a previously little known heavy metal band.  (Can you imagine that happening in the U.S.?)    Listening to this CD you can hear why.  This was then and now the ideal music for speeding down the freeway with this particular album blaring loud (probably on an eight track at the time).  The aforementioned title track is particularly earthshaking, taking the deceptively simple but highly catchy riff patterns of bands like AC/DC before them and merging them with the reverb of early Motorhead.  Side 2 of the original vinyl opens with the track that best embodies this spirit, \\"Freeway Mad.\\"  The record's second half actually proves to be speed metal city for the most part, on standout scorchers like \\"See the Light Shining\\" and \\"Machine Gun.\\"  Sure, Motorhead and Judas Priest before them had at times been fast, but Saxon were FAST.  You just did not find tempos this rapid in music in 1980 without crossing over into hardcore punk, making Saxon one of speed metal's true pioneers.    These 2009 remasters are infinitely superior to any previous pressings of their early albums, both in sound quality and packaging.  They boast a much fuller and more roomy sound than older editions, more like listening to the original LP, but without the expected crackles and pops of 30-year-old vinyl records.  To add to that there are great and informative liner notes with input from frontman Biff Byford himself.  The icing on the cake is that each CD contains a reproduction of the original LP's back cover, making them essential for collectors.    Saxon would just keep getting better and better and followed up \\"Wheels of Steel\\" with two even better LPs (one later the same year!).  \\"Wheels of Steel\\" though remains a defining moment in the band's career and brings you right back to the excitement of the early NWOBHM scene.  Highly recommended.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I didn't expect to like this series.  The characters just drew me in, and now I'm finding myself eagerly awaiting Season Three!  I liked Season One better than Two, primarily because the whole thing in Season Two with Marianne the Maenad was dumb, irritating, and I just didn't care at all what happened to her.  It seemed a weak spot in the story line and a detraction from the regular characters we've come to know and love.  In discussions with other Truebies, I find I was not alone in my reaction to the Marianne story line.  But the \\"regulars\\", Sookie, Bill, Jason, Tara, Eric, Pam, Sam, etc., are like old friends now, and I love to see their personalities develop as the series goes on.  As to \\"Team Eric\\" or \\"Team Bill\\"...wow, that's a hard one.  Bill is the true-blue romantic love that seems the most destined to last, for Sookie.  But Eric...hmmmm...I have a feeling we'll see some surprises from him in the upcoming season, and aside from being astonishingly gorgeous, his personality does grow on you (or maybe that's just the glamour talking..).  Go and take a little visit to Bon Temps, I think you'll find it a nice place to hang out.
B001Y8WAJQ|5.0|During my formative years, an older, more experienced \\"seen-it-all\\" metal veteran friend of mine played a song and band I had never heard up to that point -- it was Saxon's \\"Denim and Leather.\\"  In hearing it, I was instantly addicted to the awesome, reverby power chords in the song and the timeless lyrics of metal brotherhood and the D.I.Y. spirit that anyone who wants to can get up and start a band if they so desire.  This song embodied the very essence of the NWOBHM scene that spawned Saxon, one in which bands released some of the most exciting hard rock/heavy metal music the world had ever known, largely through independent and self-financed recordings made outside the bounds of major labels and record executives.  I luckily found the LP used at the time at a local mom-and-pop record store (remember those?).  (This was back in the early to mid-'90s, when both Saxon's and most NWOBHM releases in general were only available on CD in the form of outrageously expensive Japanese imports, that I by default couldn't afford.)    Years later though I did get my hands on the 1996 Holland import CD pressing on Disky of the vinyl record I'd long cherished, \\"Denim and Leather.\\"  Let me tell you that I've never been more disappointed in my life!  Not only was the packaging terrible and almost nonexistent, but the sound quality was noticeably \\"cleaned up\\" and sterile, all but stripping this masterpiece of its original rawness and power.    You can imagine then how much I rejoice now in 2009, when Saxon's early releases FINALLY get CD releases that for the first time do these essential recordings justice.    Never has this been more apparent than on the group's strongest outing to date, \\"Denim and Leather,\\" originally released in September 1981.  Finally, that awesome reverb and big roomy sound of the original vinyl is back and forever frozen in time on CD, and without the expected crackles and pops characteristic to old records.  Unlike previous pressings, this sounds just like the vinyl.    \\"Denim and Leather\\" contains some of Saxon's all-time classic songs and ones still played live by the band to this very day.  Aside from the aforementioned title track, the album features the single \\"Never Surrender,\\" a fast and true heavy metal anthem for the ages about soldiering on and never giving up, even when people and other forces of opposition stand against you.  If Saxon's music doesn't embody this spirit, I don't know what does.  \\"Play It Loud\\" is an earthshaking number about cranking this music up loud and proud, even when people try to silence it, and this particular record was tailor made for doing just that.  My all-time favorite though has to be the speed metal scorcher on the LP's B-side, \\"Fire in the Sky.\\"  I've always loved it.  If the frantic tempos and awesome reverb of this track don't blow the roof off the place in no time flat, nothing will.    If that weren't enough, each reissue contains liner notes with input from frontman Biff Byford himself and even a reproduction of the LP's original back cover, making them essential for collectors, so much so that I've officially retired my worn old Carrere vinyl pressing of this album.  (It goes without saying that I also have sold my copies of the previous, inferior CD pressings and upgraded to these.)    In short, this is one of the greatest heavy metal records of all time and finally in a reissue that gives the recording a new lease on life.  Highly recommended.
B0010V4TZU|5.0|i've read both sides of the spectrum....frankly i freaking love this album and cant wait til Jan for the new release!! Was hooked 1st time i herad \\"A Punk\\", not to mention my 3 yr old begs me to jam it as soon as we get in the Element. I wouldnt say its totally original but they do show signs of sum originality. If you like these doods try and pick up Talking Heads album \\"speaking in tongues\\" or Paul Simon \\"Graceland\\" and even Peter, Bjorn, and Johns good album!! Writers Block....feel as if they infuse above mentioned together as well as a twist of their own. If this wasnt helpful sorry....it jus means yer lame!!
0385532458|2.0|A little disappointed at the work that seems more of a high school english student than that of a great author as Grisham is. I hope his next regains what he has done in the past.
0525478183|4.0|I too, thought this book was brilliant and exciting. In reality, I read this whole book in one sit down (which took me about 5 and a half hours) because I was just so engrossed in it.  I don't want to write a book for a review for a book, so I'm going to keep this short.  The story is excellent, compelling, and never uninteresting. I give it all my praise and suggest anyone who may possibly read this, to read the book.  I have only ONE gripe about this book, and it kills me so. This only gripe being how easy everything is. How everything just falls into place a little too perfectly that allows Quentin to search everything he needs to while looking for Margo. How his parents are so oblivious. How he can pull everything off with never a single consequence etc.  That, to me though, is not NEARLY enough to dissuade you from reading this book. It is an excellent read and I recommend it to ANYONE looking for a good mystery/thriller.

B002MW50KO|1.0|Terrible so-called singing. Dylan never was much of a singer, but I didn't realize his voice was this bad. His fans, however, will lap this up like the hungry dogs they are. Some people are gluttons for punishment.
B000UMXCTY|1.0|Product review, not music content-    First, the artwork on the discs is identical to the the box art. The mini-LP jackets are not high quality like the Japanese sleeves. The inner paper sleeves that hold the CDs are glued and not resealable so you will likely tear them and discard them when opening. The version I have has a cheap cardboard slipcase, not a picture box, and the booklet is comprised of just track listings.     There may be a few versions of this set, so beware. Maybe the version with the actual box is very nice...

B000Q6GX5Y|1.0|Half an hour into the Blu-ray DVD of \\"300\\" I switched off in order to belatedly study the Amazon reviews, in order to discover if anyone else found the sound so badly muffled, with mumbling, whispering actors, but it seems I may be the only victim, with the volume of our quite new Sony Bravia TV turned to maximum level.    As I have several revamped 70-years-plus films on DVD, including the 1938 masterpiece of Errol Flynn's and Olivia DeHavilland's \\"Robin Hood\\", with clear sound, I am baffled as to why 2007 sound technology can be so crudely and feebly inferior.    As for \\"300\\" itself, I wondered why they bothered to try to improve on the original \\"The 300 Spartans\\" film featuring Richard Egan and Sir Ralph Richardson, created so magnificently in 1962 with credibly effective Spartan armour and uniforms, not the almost-naked he-men ludicrously unsoldierly portrayal of King Leonidas's \\"300\\"!!!      Having endured the rest of \\"300\\", its music not too bad except for the occasional now crudely-fashionable overdone, mindless percussion, the sound quality was at its almost inaudible worst during scenes back home in Sparta, but very loud during one of the add-on interviews with producers.  The only character to impress me with credible portrayal was the courageous Queen of Sparta.    As a campaigner for facts on global warming, I am well used to disputing reason versus fantasy, so I recommend study of Amazon viewers' opinions on the 1962 film, some damning or praising the 2007 version of the Spartans' truly 'magic' action in and around a mountain narrow coastal pass in what is now Turkey, long obliterated by collapsing sediment.    I firmly commend the book \\"The Year of Thermopylae\\" by Ernle Bradford (Macmillan, 1980), which includes a now topically controversial mention of 480BC Persian King of Kings Xerxes boasting of Aryan stock!!!  Also now topical is Bradford's study therein of 480BC developments in close-quarters weapons, because 20th century former cavalry colonel Allan Mallinson's 1790s-1830s novels surely provide ample evidence for the versatile sabre to be reintroduced in today's British Army in Afghanistan!    The 1962 film remains an oft-viewed treasure to me, while the 2007 Blu-ray DVD monstrosity is destined for the next charity bag.  If the film makers want something also stupendous to work on, I suggest they accurately study the colossal Sea Battle of Salamis, with the fleets of Greece and Persia confined to narrow waters, with bloody fighting across the decks of all the ships jammed tightly together.  There is far too much sheer magic in true or as near as possible true history for its needing to be fantasised.    Alan H Dale.

0760700451|5.0|A story of two sisters who search for marriage partners. What is nice about Jane Austen is the quality and quantity of conversation, so that the reader imbues a sense of the 1800s among the countrified gentry. The memorable characters run the gamut from respectable, cultured Colonel Brandon to his opposite John Willoughby, who is out for a good-time with the ladies. The lady between them is Marianne Dashwood--inexperienced, beautiful, artistic, and idealistic. She is lovingly censured for her candor and romanticism by her older sister, Elinor Dashwood--rational, proper, loyal, and stoic. Before they marry an appropriate partner, a whirlwind of misjudgments, gossip, and surprises threatens to upset their chances at happiness.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I never watched the show while it was on TV due to my dislike of Martin Sheen and the political slant of the show. I am glad i finally started watching as I found the show very interesting and easy to watch. I even have to admit Sheen was likeable in this role. Leo was my favorite character and it was sad to lose him before the series ended. Toby, Josh and CJ were difficult to like thanks to their extreme arrogance.<br /><br />I highly recommend.
B001E57SH8|3.0|I simply expected more from Zippo. The lighter works... most of the time. It's just not reliable enough for me to only bring it when I want to smoke a cigar.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Simply amazing, she can be classy and humble at the same time but there is nothing humble about her voice. Strong and rich, she sings her heart in the selection of music on this CD. What I find most appealing is the liner has the lyrics to every song and Susan has added her own comment as to what the song means to her, very revealing and personal, especially \\"Who I Was Born To Be\\". Beautifully done, definitely five stars plus.
B000063DHL|4.0|I remember buying this album on the first day of release, how excited was I!....Great memories.  The first real cracks in the maiden armor was on this album.  This is when bruce started singing out of key,  which is not good when you can't even sing in key on the studio records.  Still a pretty good album.
B002BWP47E|5.0|Watching \\"The September Issue\\" is a joy, as it would be to watch any master craftspeople at work. Anna Wintour and Grace Coddington and quite simply just very, very good a the job that they do. Funny too...we hear Grace in one scene saying how she likes the soft look of the shoot she has just done. In the next scene we see Anna asking her minions to print the same pictures out again as they are kind of \\"misty\\" and to try and sharpen them up. Fascinating to watch Anna Wintour narrow her eyes when she hears a direction for a planned shoot that she doesn't like. Simplistically, Anna is \\"head\\" to Grace's \\"heart\\" but the full relationship is quite complicated. Anna doesn't hide her censure but when she does finally say that something is acceptable to her you can see that it means a lot (even to Grace).
B000063DI9|3.0|This wasn't a bad album,  but it's not nearly as great as their earlier stuff.  This is when maiden started to decline, actually, somewhere in time was when the first cracks appeared. Still, both albums are good.
1439102813|5.0|This is an extremely compelling novel, written in a sensitive and compassionate style that allows you to feel what it's like to be diagnosed and live with Alzheimer's disease. Prior to reading this when Alzheimer's was mentioned my thoughts and sympathy were always focused on the family, not the victim of this terrible disease, now my heart will go out to Alice. The writing has such a personal feel to it that as Alice struggles with each new phase of this disease and comes to terms with the depth of what she is being robbed of, it is easy to forget it's fiction. It's absolutely heart wrenching to watch her slowly lose control of her mind and life, made even more tragic because she knows it's happening. The author also shows the effect on the family as hope for a cure becomes less and less a viable option. This emotional story will bring tears to your eyes and a passion for finding a cure for Alzheimer's.
B000063DFQ|5.0|the best of the bruce years.  Was my favorite as a kid, and stands up nicely after all these years. I think maidens best was piece of mind, killers, powerslave and maybe the first album.
0061537969|5.0|I loved this feel good original book. Garth Stein not only entertained me, but gave me a new found appreciation for my dog. Non animal lovers don't be put off, it's not an animal story. It's about life, love and relationships. The central character for this story is a lovable, devoted dog named Enzo (who is also the narrator). Told from his point of view brings a very an interesting perspective about human behavior to this heart felt and genuine story about life and its struggles. Rarely does a book bring me to tears or make me laugh out loud, and this book achieved both. Although I would categorize this as a light read it has a lot of substance and several messages through out which make you ponder some life questions. The characters are believable and somewhat flawed for a realistic view on life. Not only do you fall in love with Enzo but you will be rooting for his owner Denny (somewhat of an underdog,sorry couldn't resist).
0385504225|1.0|Very disappointing follow up to DVC.  As many reviewers have commented this is almost a cut and paste.  Indeed there were times when I wondered if Dan Brown had even written it himself or just rented his name to it.  It gets one star for sending me to Google to look up Melancolia I by Durer and getting me to think a little more about the architecture of our capital.  Otherwise the principal characters are extremely irritating (for two supposedly super intellects they remain obdurately ignorant throughout), the Neotics sub plot is irrelevant, the villain is unbelievable, and the end is so vague I still wonder if I perhaps missed some great revelation.    At least now I know what my friends' fathers were up to all those years ago when they took off to the lodge.  I thought they just wanted to get some peace away from their families.  Little did I know they were plotting world domination.  Sadly this is sure to be a major blockbuster and will doubtless be released as a poor Tom Hanks film within a year.
0375842209|5.0|Although this book is labeled Young Reader, it is packed with enough personality and thought provoking substance to make its appeal much broader. Initially the young adult label put me off, but it was recommended with such enthusiasm I bought it anyway. I have since learned that is has been marketed as a young adult book in some countries and as an adult novel in others.It is helpful to know beforehand that the narrator is Death; otherwise you may find the start of the book a little confusing. Looking at events from Death's perspective gives the book an interesting twist and a unique perspective. You feel his compassion and confusion as he is witness to the brutalities of the human race. You sense his understanding of human weakness and frailty.The book is set in Nazi Germany providing a background for a variety of characters. You meet the hard lined obsessed Nazis and the German citizen willing to risk everything to hide the Jews from them. You quickly become emotionally involved with the title character Liesel and her best friend Rudy as you watch the war come closer and intrude more and more on their day to day lives. The story and the characters are believable. The book is intense, memorable and beautifully written in a clean style. I highly recommend it.

0385341008|5.0|I think what resonates most with me about this book is the witty distinct style of each character. When I first noticed the book was in letter form I was hesitant to buy it; feeling this format may hinder the flow of the story, making it seem like homework. To my surprise it actually enhances the intimacy you feel towards the people in the story. I choose the word people rather than characters because as you come to the final page of this book, they are real, you want to fly to Guernsey and meet each one. I also love the fact that the book is historical fiction; it adds a certain depth and reality to the story. Most of what I have read on WWII deals with the years when the war was full throttle; \\" Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\" takes place post WWII when people are trying to put their lives back together. You still get vivid pictures of the isolation and desperation these people felt during the war, but you also feel the pain they all share knowing that some things will never be the same. It takes much effort to resume a normal lifestyle and the author's presentation is realistic; at times heartbreaking, at other times heartwarming.

B002HWRYJE|2.0|Look, if you are a fan of the original series, you might well be seriously ticked off by this movie. It literally invalidates the entire original series. Stuff happens in this movie which could not have happened and you may get the impression that the writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, and director JJ Abrams never saw the original series. I think that last part may be true. But according to what they say on the DVD the modern audience is not sharp enough to handle real plot and real dialog. What they say you want is non-stop fast-paced action regardless of the story.     Ok, so here are some truths. Spock never had it off with Lt. Uhura. The movie rather assumes that Kirk is an only child, yet he had a brother Sam, that was mentioned in TOS episode \\"What are Little Girls Made of?\\".  Kirk was born in Riverside Iowa, not in space. He took over as captain of the Enterprise not from Chris Pike, but from Robert April. Evidently,his eyes changed from blue to brown along the way - too much Romulan ale, perhaps. Vulcan was never destroyed, there was no black hole, Spock's mother was not killed, and on and on and on. The plot holes are big enough to fly a Constellation Class Starship through.    But remember that this movie is based around time travel and changing history. I don't want to spoil the writer's plans for the sequel (ok, yes I do) but things may well be put right in the next one.    So much for throwing rocks. The portrayal of Kirk by Chris Pine is abysmal and badly written (I had 1 rock left). However Spock is quite well done and Zachary Quinto played him with real empathy and skill. John Cho was quite a good young Sulu and Simon Pegg was a really believable Scotty. Chekov was all wrong in comparison to the Walter Koenig character but he seemed to be what Pavel Chekov was supposed to have been all along. He is not the half-witted ponce that the one in TOS was. But McCoy, holy cow, Karl Urban was nearly flawless! He was even able to overcome the lame, stupid, and patronizing dialog he has given. Most of it was fine but some was just insulting to fans. But his performance was so good as to be nearly worth the movie itself and is the only reason it gets 2 stars and not 1.    The special features portion is pretty lame and the blooper section is thin and obviously padded with filler.    Star Trek is not nearly as good as it could have been, the writers are commercial screenwriters and not storytellers, the special effects are mostly designed to keep the WWE generation amused, though they are generally pretty good. If you have a Star Trek collection, go ahead and add it but let's hope the next one is far better!
B001PU8N0I|5.0|This is a beautifully acted and directed production of the Dickens Classic.  The leads are handsomely played and wildly entertaining.  I found myself riveted to each episode.

B000MGUZMA|5.0|2004's [[ASIN:B0002IVN9W Funeral]] took all indie rock fans by surprise with its sweet, charming, intriguing sound and overwhelmingly original lyrics. Receiving perfect scores from nearly every critical publication, Arcade Fire definitely set a high standard for themselves right off the bat.<br /><br />Neon Bible is a darker, more mature, and more progressive set of Arcade Fire tunes. From the first haunting whisper of \\"Black Mirror\\" to the powerful fadeout at the end of \\"My Body is a Cage,\\" Arcade Fire paints a convicting picture of the consequences of America's focus on commercialism. With vivid parallels and resonant parables, each track becomes more and more commanding with each repeated listen.<br /><br />Album highlights, including lead single \\"Keep the Car Running,\\" \\"Intervention,\\" \\"No Cars Go,\\" and \\"Ocean of Noise,\\" each bring their own unique songwriting element to the table. Gripping lyrics abound in each of the aforementioned tracks, specifically in \\"Intervention\\" (\\"You say it's money that we need / As if we're only mouths to feed / I know no matter what you say / There's some debts you'll never pay\\"). The careful simplicity of each phrase also adds to the lyrical brilliance of leader Win Butler, as it did so prevalently additionally in Funeral.<br /><br />Though some Arcade Fire fans may not be accustomed to the album's frequent application of large arrangements or heavy organ usage, the employment of these techniques is artistically and sonically fitting and also adds some versatility to the band's catalogue. For example; organ-heavy tracks like \\"My Body is a Cage\\" and \\"Intervention\\" relate lyrically to spirituality and ecclesial conflict, making the strong presence of the organ a vital part of the songs' arrangements.<br /><br />After listening to both albums many, many, many wonderful times, I have come to the apparently uncommon conclusion that Neon Bible outdoes Funeral with its concise composition and its dark melodies. Don't get me wrong-- Classic Arcade Fire songs like \\"Neighborhoods #1 (Tunnels),\\" \\"In the Backseat,\\" \\"Wake Up,\\" and \\"Neighborhoods #2 (Laika)\\" are tough to beat or even break even with. However, Neon Bible definitely has its own classics and is a force to be reckoned with for Arcade Fire fans and other indie rock fans alike. 2007's best indie rock album, hands down.rhoods #1 (Tunnels),\\" \\"In the Backseat,\\" \\"Wake Up,\\" and \\"Neighborhoods #2 (Laika)\\" are tough to beat or even break even with.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Hey I did alot of research on this dvd before I bought it and this is only my second day but I honestly have to say that parts of my body hurt that haven't hurt since I was born I love the fact that the parts of my body that I really want to improve on are the parts of my body that hurt the most. I will keep my review updated, and as far as knees go I have a horrible knee and I'm not light and my knees arent bothering me, so I would def recommend getting this dvd its definately worth the money. And as I said I will keep my progress posted.

0684824906|3.0|In Team of Rivals, Doris Kearns Goodwin produced a highly readable work that effectively brings you back to the daunting days of the Lincoln Administration.<br />In Team of Rivals, we get a view of the war from the White House, not the battlefield. For devotees of political history, it should prove of special interest.<br /><br />Ultimately, however, this view of the executive suite doesn't quite live up to its potential to tell the epic story of America's great upheaval. Kearns Goodwin has hit the convention ciruit with the book, showing how corporate executives can benefit from studying Lincoln's approach to governance. Portions of the book read like notes for PowerPoint presentations for just such a crowd.<br /><br />When she is summing up sectional themes with the intention to provide bullet point `to-dos' for the executive crowd, the prose path gets rocky. The occasional turgid straights strand this book short of such presidential biographies as Morris's take on T. Roosevelt, or McCoullough's portrait of  H.S. Truman. Kearns Goodwin's book does not stoop so very low, but it skirts the netherland of formulaic history-books-tailored-to-the-needs-of-today's-executive;  this segment has its pantheon, an ever-changing one led by such titles such as Patton: World's Greatest Salesman; How Robert E. Lee Would Hire; or, Stonewall Jackson on the Art of the Deal<br /><br />Kearns Goodwin builds the case that Lincoln's hardscrabble frontier experiences significantly separated him from his rivals. He bested them because he was more a doer .. 'more accustomed of working to shape his own destiny.'  But while he knew the rough side (like such that followed him as Lyndon Johnson), he was `tremendously temperate and patient.'[p.254-255, paperback edition]<br />He comes off as a bit of the quintessential Midwesterner. He never seemed to be off balance. He seemed to avoid extremes. Not a small temptation in the Republican party of his time. Not a small temptation in the America leading up to and including the Civil War.<br /><br />He could fumble and stumble about, as he did with a succession of Union generals. And as he did with the notion of emancipation of slaves. Yet he could make necessary decisions. And when he found his army chief in Grant, and his political manifesto in the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln appeared as a great leader - but, still, a remarkable mix of the firm and the mild. [p.262] All and all, this comes across in Kearns Goodwin's writing, but the pontoon bridge that gets it over is a bit of a feeble artifice, build to suit the dual and devilish purpose of telling history and cheering on corporate managers.<br /><br />No doubt, today's management class needs some new insights in order to better manage. But general conclusions taken from Lincoln's four years in power are probably not enough to deter them from continuing to do what they are already doing, albeit with a slightly more sophisticated sense of nuance. The book lacks the fire of history experienced, and, as such, a lecture based on the text  is most likely a quick route to reinforcement and buttressing, not illumination. But if you eat up them U.S. history books, you will probably have more joy than pain in the reading of Team of Rivals.Civil War.

0307454541|5.0|I read books the same way I eat, with lots of variety.I read mysteries the same way I eat brownies, quickly with not enough savoring going on. I read long novels the way I eat beef stew, making it last, enjoying all the different flavors and hominess of it. I read chick lit like it's a sorbet, sweet and light, and just right for the moment.<br /><br />So, when I picked up The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson, I was expecting a quick mystery read. I ordered it on a whim, when I saw that Stephen King had highly recommended it. Hey, if Uncle Stevie recommends it, I'm game.<br /><br />At first, I was concerned, it opened up with Mikael Blomkvist on trial for libel. This was a concern on several levels. One, Mikael Blomkvist. I don't do well with translated novels. My brain spends too much time trying to get used to the unusual names to focus on the story. And two, trials for libel are not my kind of mystery. Every once in awhile, I'll get into a courtroom drama, but they're not my favorite. Luckily, I kept reading. Because after a few short pages of trial talk, it started to get better, and better, and better.<br /><br />As it says on the back of the book, this story combines murder mystery, family saga, love story, and financial intrigue into a complex and atmospheric novel.<br /><br />It's a mystery that reads like a favorite dramatic novel. I highly recommend this book.  This is book one of a trilogy, and I plan on reading the whole series. Unfortunately, with Stieg Larsson's recent death, there will be no more new books.

It also makes a lot of noise when on the hardwood floors.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|I am just enough of a nerd to get red shirt jokes.  So I went in to my first viewing of this movie with a decent knowledge of the universe and an open mind- and was handsomely rewarded.    This movie has it all, emotion (I teared up in the first 5 minutes), action, humor, hot men (and ladies, if you swing that way). The casting is brilliant, and the actors do an excellent job of interpreting the character rather than parroting the already iconic performances of their predecessors. No one wants to see a 90 minutes long Shatner impression, and Chris Pine doesn't torture us with one. Instead he embodies the bravado, humor and charm of Kirk in his own way and does a charming job. Quinto goes a little further in adopting Nimoy's mannerisms, but just enough to make the character feel right.    I know several of my more hard core trekkie friends take issue with parts of this story. To them I say, with love: Get over it. Its a movie, and a good one at that.     The blueray has nice special features- the gag reel is funny. I'm not big on those things, but they are there for those who are. The sound and picture quality were good (probably even excellent, once again not really my thing). The menus on the DVD seemed a little boring and a little light on content, but who the hell buys a DVD for the menus. The packaging leaves me a little bored, but once again I bought it for the movie not the box. I appreciate the inclusion of a digital copy.

The battle sequences are detailed without being too much. The complexity of the relationship between Po and Cat is fantastic. And the story is always moving somewhere. This is a must read!!
B0026P3G12|4.0|I received Susan's new album.  Her incredible voice was still there.  However, the song selection did not do her justice at all.  The strength and quality of her voice needs music and lyrics to show it off...all 12 songs, not just two or three.  From that standpoint, I was disappointed.  I keep flipping over to the several I like and the rest seem like a waste of my time as I can't identify with the words or music.  Believe it or not, my favorite song on the album is \\"Who I Was Born To Be\\" because it had so much passion in her voice along with her beautiful tonal qualities.  That passion was lacking in most the other songs.   But I'm looking forward to more albums by her.  We so need to hear refreshing voices with clear words you can understand, tonal quality that moves us into our own dream world, and music that is inspiring rather than ear-popping.  Thanks Susan, for having the courage to step out and for being the joy you are to so many of us.  Helen

1439102813|5.0|My dear wife, Barbara, has had probable Alzheimer's Disease now for over twenty years.  It started in her mid-fifties.  For the past three years, she has been almost unconscious.  But, when I touch her lips with a spoonful of food or tumbler of liquid, she can still open her mouth and swallow.  The doctors are amazed at this.  They tell me they have never had an Alzheimer's patient last so long, and who can also swallow at this very low point in the disease.  I am blessed in that I am able to take care of Barbara in our home.  All of this to say, STILL ALICE is a magnificent book!  I could not put it down, because it connected so powerfully with our particular experience.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who is being impacted by Alzheimer's Disease.  Lisa Genova has captured the essence of early-onset Alzheimer's better than anyone else I have read.  I give this book my highest recommendation.

037571457X|5.0|I have been wanting to try reading more graphic novels for awhile now. It can be a daunting task picking from a new genre of book to read, but thanks to twitter, I had a ton of great suggestions. Persepolis stuck out in my mind because I remember the film adaptation of it being nominated for an Oscar. I dove into this book, and had a hard time coming up for air.<br /><br />Once I started reading this book, the artwork stood out as interesting, unique, and not at all what I would have expected from a graphic novel. Many of the images need no words to express what the author is trying to get across.<br /><br />What stood out to me the most though, was the amazing story of growing up in revolutionary Iran. I would argue that one of the best ways to understand a period of history, is to hear the story from the people who lived it. Marjane describes so many aspects of her childhood during such unstable times. I love when she talks about getting cassette tapes on the sly, and how her parents sewed pop culture posters into her dad's coat to smuggle them into Iran for her. Moments like that in the story remind the reader that she wasn't just a child living through a war, she was a child just like any other child. She wanted posters on her wall, the latest music, and had crushes on boys.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, I was reading this on the bus to work one morning and a man asked me how I was liking the book. He then told me that he was a teenager in Iran during that time, he told me a bit about his experiences and how very frightening a time it was.<br /><br />An absolute must read for anyone and everyone! I loved this book and can't wait to start the second book Persepolis: The Story of a Return.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I had purchased both the stereo and mono box sets.  I'm a hard core Beatles fan and think the Beatles should be heard as they were originally intended, in mono.  The first 10 albums were originally recorded in mono and later on remixed in stereo.  I have found one remaster set is just as brilliant as the other.  I love the way the mono set was packaged.  Each CD is a replica of the original album complete with original liner notes, inner plastic protective sleeve and paper album sleeve.  It comes in a white slip-out box with \\"The Beatles\\" in black letters with a picture of an apple beneath it.  Just as the stereo remixes sound brilliant, clear and crisp, so too does the mono remix set.  To be honest with you, I can't and couldn't choose which remix set is better.  They are both brilliantly done and they both sound beautiful.  If you have the original vinyl LP or the original CD release, forget them.  These remaster sets just blow all that away..  If you're as big a hard core Beatles fan as I am, then both remaster sets are a must.  I listen to them to try to pick out the differences between them.  I wonder if Capitol Records are going to complete their \\"The Capitol Albums\\" series now that the remasters are out.  I sure do hope they will as the American versions are also nice to hear.
B00008G8LV|5.0|Exceptionally great movie. Perfect script. Perfect acting by Michael Douglas. The script, powerful and loaded scene after scene. Writing skills at their best, which has contributed to the movie's success more than all other aspects combined. Michael Douglas has brought out the spirit of the story extremely well. All other actors have done very well, too, and so has the director. The strong message of ethics presented makes this movie appropriate for teens as well as adults.\\"
B0026P3G12|5.0|I found this CD to be every bit as wonderful as I had hoped. Her clean, clear and concise voice gives the music a very pleasant feeling. Unlike so many other new artist, her versions of these timeless classics don't sound contrived. I sat and listened to the whole CD and wondered where the time went. I hope to see Susan Boyle try something a little more daring in the future. I think songs like AveMaria would lend itself well to her. And I'd love to hear her do a Gospel Album. This CD gets A++.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Technically, this is a fine project and Boyle's voice is in fine form.  The raw talent and power of her original U-Tube performance of the title song is elipsed by the version here, as Susan disappears into the lyrics and becomes this poor warf in the song.  Simply stunning performance.    The timing of this CDs release could not have been better and the inclusion of \\"Silent Night\\" and \\"Amazing Grace\\" will only attract people who purchase holiday projects, as well as those who would have purchsed this in the first place and there are MANY, myself included.  It was certainly worth the wait.    Her rendition of Madonna's \\"You'll See\\" is absolutely wonderful and I'll bet has silenced any and everyone who's ever called her \\"Susie Simple\\" or \\"Susie Bong\\". The original song, \\"Who I was born to be\\" is another vocal stunner. There's nothing \\"simple\\" about the way that her honest, riviting version of \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" captured so many, both young and old.  I watched U-Tube versions of the \\"Britian's Got Talent\\" Tour and kids were screaming for her as if they were attending a Jonas Brothers concert! And already, they're predicting that she may move as many as 700,000 copies of this CD in the first week and this is in America alone! \\"Rehab\\" by Eminem moved 608,000 earlier this year, so it's in first place.  This will top it and possibly end up being the biggest seller of the year.  How? Well, according to billboard, Taylor Swift has the biggest seller and it's still under two million.  Boyle could easily top two million before the year end charts from Billboard.  However, since their system is based on chart position and points, a lessor selling CD will end up being their top seller.  Let's hope that billboard starts going by actual sales one day.  It's amazing that Josh Groban had the number 2 selling CD for two years running (Noel), which outsold everything out there both years.    Note to all of the young record executives: You can sell artist based on just talent. We know that sex sells, but everyone gets tired of the same old thing, over and over again. I find it interesting that Rihanna's new CD is underperforming and I also find it interesting that, all of the younger artist have to stoop to tackiness (see the cover and back cover of \\"Rated R\\"), just to sell a record.  Record executives have been complaining that people are not buying but stealing music these days.  Well the truth is, THEY HAVE NOT BEEN SELLING MUSIC. Now, learn somthing that you should have learned from all of the millions that Josh Groban has been selling as he's outsold all of the Beyonce's, Jay-Z's, hip-hop stars and half-naked MTV wanna-be artist and did it without ever having a top 40 billboard charting pop single.  When you make music, the people will come out and buy it and remember not to cater to just one limited group of people.  Note that all of them are buying Susan! \\"You are WHO YOU WERE BORN TO BE\\"
B001OQCV24|3.0|2012 is talked about very much these days, I'm sure everyone has heard about the world coming to an end in that specific year. The Maya civilization's calendar ends on that specific day and there are various beliefs about the date. The movie 2012 is about the apocalyptic event, it shows us what could happen. The movie starts in 2009 and goes to the following years gradually and explains what happens in these years that relate to the 2012 date which I thought was well made. It follows the stories of geologist Adrian Helmsley and of divorced father Jackson Curtis, a writer who works as a limousine driver who works for a rich Russian. Helmsley learns from his friend in India while visiting him that the earth`s temperature is increasing and that it will lead to the end of the world. He informs President Thomas Wilson of this. The other story has Curtis learning about the end of the world and tries to save his children and his ex-wife. There is this huge plot about the end of the world and the stories of two individual`s struggles because of it. One wants to save the world and the other wants to save his family.<br /><br />There have been a few doomsday movies in the past few years and this one is no doubt capitalizing on movies like The Day After Tomorrow`s success. 2012 ends up being a little long at over 2 hours and a half but there are plenty of special effects that will amaze you and keep you interested throughout the movie. The characters are interesting but not to point that I really cared about them that much. I know this movie is based on the said 2012 event but some things in there just don`t seem very realistic or convincing. 2012 relies perhaps too much on special effects rather than on the story itself. It`s a good serious attempt at making us live the end of the world (if you believe in it) trough more than 2h and a half, it`s real honest and to the point. It is true that the ones that could be saved would be the rich an powerful people but seeing it makes you realize it.I liked 2012 but I would say that unless you`re really interested in the end of the world you`d be better just renting it when it comes out on DVD instead.ize it.I liked 2012 but I would say that unless you`re really interested in the end of the world you`d be better just renting it when it comes out on DVD instead.

B0026P3G12|4.0|Although I did give this cd a healthy 4 stars, it's a shame I couldn't give it 5.<br /><br />The lady has a spectacular voice and while I admit I was surprised at how different it sounded, as opposed to the YouTube presentation of I DREAMED A DREAM, it didn't take away my enjoyment of most the songs.  Which brings us to the disappointment of the title song, I DREAMED A DREAM.  How sad the producers could not work out a way to include the original performance from Britians Got Talent. They took a song that was done with a palpable desperation from a woman who clearly understood this was her last great chance at escaping the life to which she'd been born and turned it into a generic version of a beautiful song. Don't get me wrong, the words and music to it are so incredible it would be difficult to totally ruin it, but I truly hoped they would leave it and her alone.<br /><br />For me, the best of the cd is YOU'LL SEE, previously done by Madonna. This could have been written for her voice and was a wonderful choice for her. Much better than the original version.<br /><br />Number two on the list was the suprising WILD HORSES. I don't know if I'd produced it quite this way had I been in charge, but it is still a beautifully done song and a brilliant choice.<br /><br />Then we have CRY ME A RIVER, AMAZING GRACE, HOW GREAT THOU ART, WHO I WAS BORN TO BE, PROUD -- all solid.<br /><br />Honestly, I didn't much care for DAYDREAM BELIEVER way back when Davey Jones was singing it, and I still don't. Not that she didn't do a good job on it - I just don't like the song.<br /><br />I missed the emotional letting go that I saw on YouTube. All these songs, no matter how well they're done, lack the depth of her original performance and none of them truly allow her to let herself go to the heights of that time.  I still can't watch her sing I DREAMED A DREAM without my eyes filling with tears. This is a cd well worth having and listening to repeatedly.  I am already looking forward to her next one and hoping for a little more stability in song choices as well as a thoroughness in picking new material that showcases what she can really do.stability in song choices as well as a thoroughness in picking new material that showcases what she can really do.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|I kind of came into this movie in the middle but all I can say from what I saw is when the little girl did her talent performance. Let's just say I cannot view Rick James' \\"Superfreak\\" the same again.  For one thing, this family is dysfunctional from the word go. Big time back seat drivers, but in spite of their own quirks and such, they do rally behind the little girl so that she could enter The Little Miss Sunshine contest and enter it she does. I am a bit surprised how they came cross country in such a broke down vehicle, but then again, I seen worse, and if your determination is more than the circumstances, that wins through. But when that little girl did her song, I fell out. First of all, you got all these prim, grown looking little girls up there looking Jon Benet Ramsey clones doing cutesy stuff; but you got this little girl  dancing to \\"Superfreak\\" albeit not appropriate for a little girl, not for a beauty show of Jon Benet clones, and when the folks went off, I could see the mother's concern for her child shine through for a bit, but when they joined her, I saw a family who showed love and concern for the smallest of their family. So to me, they can't be that dysfunctional.Quirky, not your average, everyday family, but family nonetheless.

B002KWLUU0|2.0|While I agree with a previous reviewer that this album is only deserving of two stars, I wholeheartedly disagree with the reviewer's contention that Prefab Sprout was never one of the greats. Steve McQueen, Jordan, and Swoon all rate with the very best of their era. Unfortunately, LCTWWM is a lackluster effort in almost every respect. Let's start with the fact that these are demos. So, Neil Conti - one of the best drummers in the business - is replaced by a machine. That's a huge loss. Additionally, Wendy Smith's unique, ethereal vocals aren't present. That's another huge loss. Wendy's vocals, by virtue of being even more otherworldly than Paddy's, provided contrast which gave his vocals some weight. Then, there's the fact that Paddy's instrumental voice is best expressed through the guitar. He's a better than passable guitarist. Sometimes - such as on the re-recorded Steve McQueen cuts released a few years ago - he's brilliant. Unfortunately, his guitar is virtually absent from these procedings. Finally, we have the songs themselves. While each song can stand on its own as a decent composition, the theme is so narrow and relentless that it becomes tiresome. Music is God's gift to the world... OK. One or two songs could have covered that thought well enough. There's a reason this languished in the vaults for so many years. It's too flawed to ever be regarded as a major work by a major talent. Only the pent-up demand of the faithful caused this to be released.

I felt like I was forced to react to this exalted status.  Well, I have to conclude that it is probably impossible to single out any movie as the best, but if I had to it wouldn't be \\"Citizen Kane.\\"    This is not to say that I thought it was a bad movie at all.  However, Welles's innovative use of the camera, which causes so many to regard it so highly, was so relentless that I was frequently pulled out of the story to consider the artifice of it, making it feel rather cold and technical.  I found the story involving, even though I couldn't really connect with the characters, and would still recommend it.

B000ZELISO|3.0|Was this movie actually based on the book? I realize there are time restrictions for movies, but when I couldn't even explain what some of the scenes or plot was about to a casual fan friend of mine, that left me sad. How about at least giving us fans an \\"under edited\\" version for the DVD! Come on, the burrow never burned down and Dumbledore died, where's the funeral scene! These last two theatrical installments are miserable! I'm just completing  collections at this point. I just hope they don't flub the final two movies. At this current rate of deviation, they might as well make Harry Potter a vampire in a homosexual love triangle in the deathly hallows movies! My advice would be to read the books for a plot, see the movies for mental imagery then, reread the book to figure out what you just saw. p.s.(the audio books are awesome!)

At first it seems rather odd but it is interesting how the author created this story.<br /><br />It is well worth reading and will be beneficial in any of the courses that I will be teaching.

B00078XGRO|1.0|My God, I've seen most all the Next Generation series at least three, four times now.  This movie was horrendously bad due to the script primarily. It didn't connect with me on any level and was more a special effects and high tech Hollywood set movie.  Characters were far underdeveloped and I'd say the script writing was on a nearly amateur level.  People who vote high on this movie I'm convinced are doing so due to the Star Trek name to save face.  I'd love to rate this movie highly but this was a bomb in every way.  Had it not been for the special effects and outstanding high tech sets, this movie would have really been exposed as horrendously bad.  It's like putting large boobs on a homely women and expecting people to think she's a model because of the size of her breasts.<br /><br />One interesting note, a guy brought this movie over for me to see claiming it was one of the better of the Star Trek NG movies.  I was forced to watch this piece of garbage for two hours of my life because if it, and our friendship is now over.  This movie ruined a perfectly good friendship.
B001U0HBPG|4.0|In most cases, I prefer the book over the movie but in this case I preferred the movie version of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. It is a modernized version of the book and I liked that it took the story to a deeper level that the book in short story form did not. The premise of the movie is loosely based on the book but has taken more creative liberties to expand on themes and events that didn't occur in the book. In the movie, Benjamin is born as an old white man and ages backwards but is not raised by his family and instead is abandoned at a home for the elderly and is essentially raised by a loving and nurturing black woman who lives and works there. Benjamin fits into this environment and new family well and develops relationships and an understanding of what happens as one ages normally. Benjamin is played by Brad Pitt who does a fabulous job and is easy on the eyes to watch as he gets younger. A love story and beautiful relationship develops with Cate Blanchett's character that shows their relationship and the short years that they were able to be a family and have a normal relationship. I didn't like how they ended the movie and how Benjamin chooses to live his life as he ages into infancy. This movie isn't a love story but more of a story about death and aging.    I believe that the book and the movie are about life, death and aging. Both are about finding our place in the world however we come into the world and managing to make the best of that experience. We all age in different ways and in Benjamin's case is an extreme example as he ages backwards. The premise is that he is different and has to learn how to live life to the fullest being different.
B0006AAS5G|4.0|I own the Swiss-quartz version of this watch (which is brilliant) and I was expecting the lower Japanese movement to be similar in build quality and construction. Unfortunately it is not. I purchased this as a gift for a family member figuring that it would be identical to the version that I have aside from the movement.<br /><br />The Metal on the watch just isn't constructed with the same material as it is on the higher end Swiss models that Invicta makes. The crown and chronograph buttons feel as if they can be easily stripped when screwing them down. The biggest complaint I have with the watch is the fact that the watch doesn't appear to have a \\"lap timer\\" function. I'm going to call Invicta to see if this is a faulty functionality or if that's just how the watch operates.<br /><br />For those who don't know:<br />A \\"lap timer\\" function allows you to pause the stop watch on a chronograph while it still keeps time. This is so you could record a \\"lap time\\" and resume the timer and it will jump to the correct position that it would have been at had you not paused the timer. This is normally done by starting the timer with the top button and pressing the bottom button. You would then resume by depressing the bottom button again. This watch just resets anytime you press the second button.<br /><br />On the good side. It is a fairly well constructed watch. The casing feels heavy, but not cumbersome. It looks like a $400 watch, but cost less than $100 bucks. If you're a watch enthusiast or if you've owned anything better than a Seiko chronograph then go for the Swiss model. This applies to ALL Invicta watches.

Focus and contrast was not as sharp as I expected - perhaps the poor packing/shipping had some effect on this or perhaps it is a bad copy.

031606792X|3.0|As you read this book, Meyer creates this suspense that builds throughout the book, but then everything turns out differently than expected. Meyer tends to do this in all of her books, where there's this danger that seems like they can't get out of it, but at the end, everything turns into a happy ending. She rushed things in this book too much. But, of course, if you are a dedicated Twilighter, you are obviously going to think it's the best finale ever. Give me your imput, critical readers.

B000W1MEFG|5.0|I've been trying to find this album again after first falling in love with \\"My One And Only Love\\" about 8 years ago (probably due to a girl). For the life of me, I couldn't locate it anywhere on my computer's hard drive (somehow the only track I had that didn't make it after my last machine crashed), nor could I remember its name nor the artists.<br /><br />I knew (or thought I knew) it had the word \\"Love\\" and had a tenor sax, but as powerful as Google is, it couldn't tell me the answer, nor could it tell me that, \\"duh, John Coltrane was the most obvious answer, what was I thinking?!\\"<br /><br />Tonight, Sonny Rollins' cover of this track started playing from my iTunes library and within seconds it all came flooding back. Coltrane, Hartman, tenor sax, bari vocals, Tyner on keys, gorgeously restrained bass and percussion, and all of these beautiful, romantic, and deeply-considered gems. Just downloaded it and fell back in love.<br /><br />You'd be well advised to do the same.
B000V8I2QU|3.0|I think this is Bruces best ever song writing. It just gleems with sparkle, coming from all corners of our american society. From the family who morns their Gypsy Biker dead in Iraq, to the old man who longs for the days when he would get all the chicks, and now finds himself just a face staring back from the shop window, this truly is his best. Simply, because he is more introspective than ever before. He is that man who can't get the chicks, he is the man mourning the dead in Iraq and perhaps most terrifyingly is watching vietnam unfold all over again, 40 years later. He want to know not just what happened to his country, but what happened to himself? It's the most middle america album since Born in the USA.    Pure brilliance.    I do, however have an issue with the production of this record. Bruce appears to be caught up in what is known as the loudness war. Every single album made from about 1995 and on has been pushing the volume levels to ridiculous hights, and while that doesn't seem like an issue, it's a very big issue. While I don't own the cd version of magic, I do own the mp3's as well as, Vinyl. Vinyl, the magic format that makes it almost impossible to sound bad. On the vinyl, everything appears in a wall of sonic brilliance that doesn't hit the digital limits that make the magic cd and mp3's sound so bad. I cannot describe the cd version well enough, but lets just say it sounds like every song is coming out of those white ipod earbuds, even when you have a system that can make it so that on Bruces earlier albums, he's right there with you, singing to you in your own private concert.  It's so freaking bright, so brittle on the high end, it makes my ears bleed. The volume level is wayyyy to hot. Sounds as loud as christina agulara's back to basics, which is one of the loudest of the new millennium. If that is what bruce wanted, then I have to question his thinking. He's trying to modernize himself. He, like many in the industry, thinks that the louder and brighter his record sounds, the more people will buy it. This, from the guy who said he hated the posters proclaiming him the future of rock and roll. NOW he wants to sound cool? Why now? The louder the record gets, the closer he gets to sounding like every bad pop record out there, and further from the man who innovated on Born To Run.    Besides, people, as you can tell from the other reviews on the site, hate the way it sounds as well. I'm sure most of them can't pin point why, or that they would know to get the much better sounding vinyl version, but they're mad. Plain and simply, they don't like it, which is a good thing.    But hey, try it out for your selves. It may just be me, but if more people know the truth, then maybe we can go back to high fidelity.    Because this couldn't be any FURTHER from high fidelity...

This Pelican Kindle edition of The Tempest doesn't have active footnotes for the Kindle, unlike their edition of The Merchant of Venice which I downloaded at the same time.  Without active footnotes, you have to click through several pages to get to the information referred to and then click several pages back to where you left off reading.

The first time i went to see it i was high off my mind. then i thought id give it another go so this time i went sober. it was still quite possiably one of the worst movies i could have ever seen. im glad that i wasted 10.50 to see everything that was in the trailer. Go watch the trailer and if your not LOVING and i mean LOVING the trailer then do not even waste your time because i promise you, you will be very disappointed.

B000EOTTV8|3.0|This is one of those movies that makes you wonder why it even got made. It's really a far-fetched little tale, but Felicity Huffman does a bang-up job in the lead role, and you get to see a lot of pretty scenery along the way as Bree and Toby traverse the USA. The critics generally liked it because it's \\"different,\\" but that's not always a good thing. I'm glad I didn't spend the time and money to see it in a theater, but as a Friday Night renter on DVD, it held my interest.

B0026P3G12|3.0|I wasn't expecting anything great from Susan's first CD except \\"I Dreamed A Dream;\\" others would have too much control. Susan hasn't been in the business long enough to know what to expect, let alone stand up for herself in a way that isn't labeled \\"diva.\\"  There are interesting song choices that were, apparently, hers; including ones from the Rolling Stones, Madonna and The Monkees.  Many of the songs were great, but about half the album was overproduced and waaaaay to slow.  What's interesting is that most of the negative reviewers love Susan, just not the CD.  Many blame Simon Cowell, but if you look at the liner notes - HE DIDN'T PRODUCE IT!  While it is his company and he may have had a hand in it, the producer was a guy named Steve Mac.  However, even if you agree with the negative reviews, please buy the CD anyway!  Give Susan the support she needs for another shot; she's got a beautiful voice, a touching story and deserves all the support she can get.

B000069KGM|5.0|It is hard to beleive that lead singer Peter Catera wound up doing theme music for a Karatie Kid film, or that Chicago made a slow but abysmal slide into synth pop. When Chicago Transit Authority came out in 1969, this was such a promising debut, I am pressed to think of a better one.<br /><br />\\"Introduction\\" starts the album, and is a multi-part suite, featuring fantastic jazz drumming, a great trumpet solo, and a firey  guitar part that introduced Terry Kath as one of the best of the era. The way the parts are put together is increadible; taking about five great little songs and turning them into a classic big one. Just listen to the way the song ends with a dissonent horn attack, and you'll know this band understood jazz asthetics. This band was ready to make a mark.<br /><br />And they were right in the storm's eye. These were the days of progressive, free form FM radio, and this album was taylor made for it.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|This is a great movie. I grew up with the \\"Original\\" Star Trek tv series and all the versions and movies that have come since. Some have been better than others, yet all have been entertaining. This latest film has great casting, a storyline that is fun and just as plausible as any that came before it. There are some great lines and plenty of action. A few times it even brought tears of joy to my eyes. Some people are just too picky, enjoy it, and remember it is just a movie.
B0026P3G12|5.0|We knew her voice as incomparable; with her CD we know her as an incomparable interpreter - thanks to the way the selections allow her to sweep us from reality to dream and back again. \\"Wild Horses\\" - the powerful urgency of the words 'wild horses...' following the sense of helplessness Susan is able to conjure up softly, subtly. \\"I Dreamed...\\" in which her clarity and volume at the high notes achieves what we have to acknowledge over and over again: the incomparability of the premier female vocal artist of our time.     What could follow two such riveting songs? A recording of one of the greatest torch songs of all time. Susan's \\"Cry Me a River\\" brings us back from the swelling magnitude of \\"Dream\\" to the reality of one person, one moment, and she wins us all over again with \\"plebian\\". It's all her song, killing them softly her way.      So - from this moment, how can it continue?  - One of the greatest songs of Christian brotherhood, in which Susan shows us there is no end to her interpretive skills or to the ability of her voice to become the beauty of the words. She - and, it has to be said, the arrangement and the choir - shows us what the song means, not only to her, but to us: humility.     One wonders what can follow the insurpassable. But \\"You'll See\\" haunts. The sweeping orchestration, a few poignant notes from a guitar - and the compelling pace that comes really from Susan who alone has the truly beautiful voice necessary to lift us through the words to new height, while still, behind it, the soft conviction of her voice diminishing at moments to a hush.     And then we are returned again to dream: \\"Daydream Believer\\" - \\"too slow\\" a self-purported critic has claimed. But isn't this the point where dream and reality merge? Where 'looking in on' is what most people - sadly, softly - do?     \\"Up the Mountain\\" follows, mirroring the transition from #3 to #4, and reality again gives way to the dimension of belief overcoming pain. Certainly, Susan's interpretation makes us forget that this is merely an interpretation and not real life, real feeling. Or isn't this just the best of interpretation - real feeling?    But now one wonders how this ends without a let-down. In four steps: 1) Gently. \\"Amazing Grace\\" recapitulates the humility sounded in #4, while recapturing as well her amazing ability for a capella - clear, rich, beautiful. 2) Softly. But taking the power with us of \\"Born to Be\\". 3) Tenderly. The understanding of simple aspiration to be loved for self, to make \\"proud.\\" And, finally, 4) Signing off: to the simple, melancholy plucking of a guitar, Susan signs off from this one-of-a-kind journey between dream and reality, with 'end of the world.'    What's left? The closest thing we know to a song of universal meaning - in what is easily one of its most moving renditions.     No CD for the cynical.
B002OVEB5S|2.0|There's really nothing interesting here. Ok you have new Slayer album, like in every 4 years, or so.    The thing that irritate me the most is the manner of 'singing', which is rather spitting words with speed close to punk/hc bands. 80% songs here have fast rhythm, and it isn't something at what Slayer is really good these days, these are just average tracks. After 3 tracks you can't really distinguish track 8th from 9th. Best track here is not surprisingly rather slow, 'Beauty Through Order\\". Sound production is decent, but again you would expect something more from Slayer, I suppose..     Not even close to 'God hate us all'.

B0000D8HDF|4.0|Transcribing the greatest cycle of music from the full symphony orchestra to the comparatively limited scope of the piano would seem like an insurmountable task. And for most great pianist-composers it probably was, except Franz Liszt. I believe the inimitable success of Liszt's achievement has not been fully recognised either by pianists or audiences. In fact, to find any of them programmed by a major (or minor) pianist is somewhere between rare and impossible.<br /><br />To my knowledge, only four pianists have committed all nine to disc: Katsaris, Biret, Howard and Scherbakov. Both [[ASIN:B000IY062K Scherbakov]] and [[ASIN:B000002ZT9 Howard]] have their merits--my lack of enthusiasm for Biret's annoyingly willful playing (currently being re-released on her own IBA label together with the Concertos and Sonatas) has been amply described elsewhere--but Katsaris surpass both of them with a substantial margin. Even though Liszt's ability to think up endlessly varied piano textures and figurations is beyond reproach, some level of repetitiveness is virtually inescapable in certain movements (e.g. Second/II, Sixth/II and Seventh/I)--there is only so much one can do with ten fingers and the percussive mechanics of a piano.<br /><br />Trading Beethoven's epoch-making orchestral writing for Liszt's pianistically inflated reductions--sounds like an absolutely preposterous venture, does it not? Indeed, regardless of how extraordinarily Katsaris renders the Third, Fifth and Ninth Symphonies, it goes without saying that Beethoven's originals are as priceless as they are irreplaceable. Still, and forgive me for swearing in church, forced to live with one version only, I would actually consider choosing the Lisztian versions of the Fourth and Eighth. Katsaris's trademark ability to vary repeats (he observes most of them throughout) and to augment sonorities (especially in the lower bass tessitura) work wonders here--as well as in the Eroica's Funeral March, where his ripping sub-bass cluster chord creates an earth shatter at the end of the fugal 'development'. His tempos are generally grand, in the traditional manner (too much so in the Third/II and Fifth/III), but daringly exciting in Finales of the Third, Seventh and Ninth.<br /><br />What deserves special mention is Katsaris's world-premiere recording of the Ninth Symphony. Initially, Liszt found the fourth movement of the Ninth impossible to transcribe for two hands only--hence, it took another two years until the four-hand, two-piano version of 1863 was replaced. What Liszt achieved here in terms of extending the boundaries of piano playing is in the same league as his own Etudes and Alkan's Op 39 Etudes, the Concerto for Solo Piano in particular. The first movement is impressively grand--Katsaris's recapitulation is, again, truly earth-shattering. The Scherzo's multiple voices come across with unbelievable clarity. But the show-stopper is the Finale, where Katsaris's sheer stamina in the near-impossible cascades of notes demands to be heard. The plus added to the four stars is to highlight that Katsaris's Ninth should be part of any piano connoisseur's discography.<br /><br />Just having reviewed V&auml;nsk&auml;'s immaculately played and recorded, but emotionally inhibited, [[ASIN:B002QEXN6Q Minnesota cycle]] on BIS, I concluded that we are not likely to see the revolutionary romanticism of Karajan's first BPO cycle being surpassed in these post-period times. Therefore, with an unfailing bias for the piano, it is most refreshing to immerse oneself in Katsaris's extraordinarily romantic and pianistic Beethoven Symphonies--caught in serviceable, if somewhat unnatural, 1980s Teldec sonics.<br /><br />REFERENCE: This Oneord creates an earth shatter at the end of the fugal 'development'.

Definitely not a film you will want to miss if you love Westerns or Clint Eastwood. Just don't expect to feel particularly cheery afterwards.
0307588335|5.0|This book is written very well and provides lots of information in a way that is understood by anybody from a high-school graduate to a business manager.  I saw the authors on book t.v. and was glued to their lecture and couldn't wait to get the book.  The thing that grabbed me was a co-author stating that this book was written to be more like a novel than a technical handbook on what happened.  He said that a carpenter (?) told him that 'this book made me understand finance'. That , plus the paragraph or two that he read aloud (very exciting), sold me.    I recommend this book highly.  It is a page-turner; you won't put it down until you've finished.  Some reviews have 'accused' the author of being a mere low-level employee (elitism at its finest).  It is the 'mere low-level employees' who usually have a much better understanding of what is going on than upper-level management.  In fact , it is probably a more interesting read than had it been written by someone on \\"the 31st floor\\".    My spouse read a few pages of it and has asked to take it with on plane business trip; so it does grab you.  Of course the author has an ego; we all have egos; ego adds excitement and personality to the story.  Who wants to read a book by somebody who has no ego?  Not me anyway.    Try it, you'll like it.        .
B001TWT0AE|5.0|This John Wayne western is unusual in that it goes beyond individuals and its conflict captures the changes that were taking place at that time. The old Old-West was a world of settling disputes by oneself through violence, of huge tracts of land owned by cattle barons, of territorial status, and of minimal imprint by civilization. The new Old-West became a world of settling disputes nonviolently through law, of small tracts of land owned by farmers, of popular democracy and statehood, and of \\"modern\\" amenities such as literacy, schooling, and railroads.<br /><br />Liberty Valance is no simple bandit: He is a hired gun (representing the old Old-West) fighting on behalf of the cattle barons who want to prevent statehood. Ransom Stoddart, the lawyer (representing the new Old-West), had been robbed, beaten, and repeatedly humiliated by Valance. Tom Donovan (John Wayne), the skilled-shooting citizen, held off Valance at one point, but otherwise was not directly involved in actions against Valance.<br /><br />Lawyer Stoddart wants vengeance, and learns how to shoot a gun. Donovan coaches him. Stoddart and Valance have an appointed duel. Does the inexperienced Stoddart have a chance? The outcome is unexpected and surprising.

B0000CD5FN|5.0|Before I start this review I should state that Joe Strummer is my hero.....I actually don't have any others especially since Elvis Costello became obsessed with trying to be remembered as one of country musics finest but Joe is top of my sicophantic list. Putting that aside, StreetCore is pure gold. It is by far the best of the Mescaleros offerings and has a complete range of tunes to keep us old punks and world music fans satisfied. I have to go on record and state that 'Burnin' Streets' is one of my all time favourite songs and even my teenager and 4 year old love it. It is a song that seems to have mass appeal and some great images have been laid to on 'You Tube' which is a great walk down memory lane for all of us who were Clash fans.     Dig through any of the tracks and you will not be dissappointed down to the last line on the final track \\"Silver and Gold\\" where Joe says \\"that's a take\\" which is sadly poignant given his untimely death. His redo's of some classics are not out of place and do justice to the originals which is no mean feat given their pedigree. There are no weak links here it is all pure Strummer brillance.    Joe Strummer is a classic and though we may never see another one like him again we can be thankful that there are reminders like StreetCore out there that remind us that the candle that burns the brightest burns shortest.......    RIP Joe....and thank you!!
4789009637|4.0|I am currently using this book in college in a course I am taking. This is the third type of Japanese book I have experienced. Its really good. Its not meant to be a self study though. Its kinda of written for a class room environment.
B002C949KE|5.0|This book offers a substantial and solid look into behavioral economics.  It is well written, to the point and an easy to read style.  It is a suprisingly quick read given the amount of content.  What really caused me to give a 5 instead of 4 is most of this I either knew or intuitively figured.  However, my measure of a good book is that: If I would have explained the topics in this book I would have said it exactly the way he did.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|Delve into the exciting story of the Dorrits, with the head Dorrit long a prisoner in the famous Marshalsea Debtors Prison: his son & two daughters come often to visit him (one called Amy stays with him there), but they also work to gain money for all of their upkeep.  When Arthur Clennam returns to England after many years abroad in China, he goes on a quest to discover the truth about 'Little Dorrit', as Amy is called, who works as a seamstress for his mother, and particularly how her father came to be in the Marshalsea.    Filled with murderers, liars, deceit, destruction, cunning & much more, this story is filled to the brim with interesting and unique characters, as only Charles Dickens could give us: from rags to riches is this story, showing the best and worst of 1820's British society:      As always, I was a little reluctant to put this in to watch, as Dickens is almost always notoriously depressing at times ~ he did not disappoint in this instance, nor, I find, did Andrew Davies and the BBC...the whole thing was most excellently done!  I was well pleased with the actors & actresses chosen, they played their parts well: the story was both intriguing and gripping, and I found that I just couldn't wait until the end to find out the truth that some characters were trying so very hard to hide.      For those of you worried about family-friendly content, in typical Dickens fashion this story is filled with evil characters, dark species of men, and wicked women: there lots of unsavory things going on, most of them revolving around murders, violence and betrayal!  Everything was handled with taste, however, but I would not recommend this for the young: there is a bit of language, some violence, adult situations, lots of threatening of beatings, flirting, seduction, etc.     I would recommend this as another exceptionally well-done Dickens tale, with the full 452 minutes doing the story every bit of justice it deserves: not for the faint of heart, but this series is cut into little bit-sized 27 minute pieces (except for the 1st and Last Episode) ~ I greatly enjoyed this series!
B0026P3G12|5.0|Wonderful album!  Susan Boyle shows the world that she is truly gifted. My husband, who usually dislikes popular music, was so touched by one song that he choked up and when my daughter and I wanted to hear the album again, he was all for it. We've heard it several times already.  It doesn't get old.  What gorgeous tone she has. She really sells these songs in a pure, ungimmicky way.  When does the next one come out?  We're ready for it!  Congratulations, Susan
0385737424|5.0|So much has been said by other reviewers, both eloquently and analytically insightful, that I have little to add. This is one of the most engaging and heart-swelling stories I have ever read, and I loved everything about it. What an absolute pleasure to share Miranda's journey! I can't wait for my children to read it - I'm just sorry I can't hand it over right away instead of having to wait for Christmas!
B002K0WBXW|4.0|I love Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock, but they were not the real reason I went to see this movie.  I went to see it because it looked really funny.  Which I must say, I did laugh A LOT. So I would reccomend it for anyone who wants to get a good laugh.<br /><br />For those of you who do not know what 'The Proposal' is about: A pushy boss (Sandra Bullock) who has been threatened to be deported.  The only way she can think to get out of it is to get married, to her assistant (Ryan Reynolds). The assistant decideds to go along with a few demands of his own, one of which is a promotion. With the news of the marriage, a sneaky immigration clerk tries to get proof that the marriage is fake. Bullock and Reynolds try to show off the marriage to his family in Alaska to have some proof.<br /><br />Basically thats the jist of it. Anyways, i liked the movie a lot, and the only reason I am not giving it five stars is because the movie is predictable. The ending is anyways, but other than that the movie is great with a ton of amazing laughs.
006135323X|5.0|A fascinating collection of behavior economics, studies, insights, and stories. You don't need an economics background to understand it. I think anyone interested in psychology, decision making, and general human nature will certainly appreciate this book.<br /><br />UPDATE: His most recent book, the Upside of Irrationality is great! It focuses more on the positive side of our irrationality (and the negatives too). Dan gives a good summary in his own words: http://www.youtube.com/watch?&v=dPQj547KXPE
B001QOGYBS|5.0|Frankly, they had me by opening the movie with \\"The Ballad of Davy Crockett,\\" which by the way, is mistakenly listed in the credits as performed by The Wellingtons. Actually it is the soundtrack version by the MelloMen, but I've seen it mislabeled elsewhere too. And the highly underrated \\"Love\\" from \\"Robin Hood.\\" How nice.<br /><br />The entire score is as unconventional as the film -- dominated by banjo and rhythm tracks to give it an \\"independent film\\" texture rather than the now-obligatory John Williams-type score (not that I don't love those scores too, this is just a fresh approach and avoids the modern factory film feel).<br /><br />Even the titles are clever, all in keeping not only with a singular director's vision, but also very much in the Roald Dahl style. This particular book, by the way, is perhaps one of the most challenging to bring to film since it is one of the few Dahl stories without magical fantasy elements.<br /><br />I think the overall takeaway, and the thread through all the other comments on this topic is -- intelligence. That's a prized commodity in so much of today's entertainment, animated or otherwise. This is a film as smart as a fox.
0060899220|5.0|A well written, easy to read, depiction of what goes on in restaurant kitchens. It has more of a men's locker room spirit than I realized. To his credit, Bourdain gives a balanced view and also describes the experience of a chef who had a very different kitchen experience than him.
B0000C5RQF|3.0|I have two issues with this DVD production:    (1)  You forced to follow the camera, which sometimes veers away from the action you'd rather be watching.  For example, one of the leads will be singing something terrific and you want to focus on them, but instead the camera zooms in on some incidental character who isn't doing much.  The worst instance is when the Queen of the Night is singing her second aria.  Just at the height of her solo, when you really want to watch her face as she sings all those difficult notes, the camera pans down to Pamina, who's lying inert on the floor like a garden slug.      2)  I question taking Mozart's brilliant music and combining it with the heavy, dark Germanic symbolism.  I guess this was Mozart's fault; it's too bad he was writing for the Germans, who rarely seem to enjoy anything airy and sensual.  At least, in this performance they don't.      Here's a third issue:  Pamina looks like a washed-out, damaged potato.  She's got gray eye shadow, her teeth are misshappen, and her costume is a smudged, dirty white.  And her lover looks middle aged and jowly.  Nothing to excite you!

B000MRA5EM|3.0|Deep Sea is visually beautiful. The audio, however, is poorly mixed. The \\"background\\" music is louder than the narrative and is annoyingly loud when the volume is turned up loud enough to hear the narration.
0385340575|3.0|I like Reacher and the way he finds himself in problems most people never get a whiff of? Unfortunately, Lee Child has let go of the action filled hard boiled character we all loved so much. Now he is simply swept along until some obligatory action on his part brings him into the fray. This would normaly be ok but the story is stilted on several levels not the least of what is Childs disdain for american foreign policy. I love the acton and enjoy good stories but leave your personal political bent out of your stories. Don't risk destroying a character we all like so much. Let me end like this book is good read as they all are but still missing something. Oh wait, that is the old Reacher.

What a breath of fresh air, with all the GARBAGE music coming out right now, it's great that i can go into a used CD store and find a gem like this from back in the day.  Every song on here is great, nothing sub-par...it's all TOP NOTCH!  man, Prince is serious...dude has talent like no other.  I'm addicted to this album\.  Sure it took me all those years to finally hear it, but better late than never.
0061719544|5.0|I hadn't read a book for ages but wanted to read this one. Like Craig I was born in Glasgow and he manages to get across perfectly what it's like growing up in the West of Scotland and all it's divides. He is very humble about his achievements (Scottish people are!) and overall there are many things in his life so far that I can relate to. A very funny and honest book
B001PCNZTK|5.0|The best live album I have ever heard, this is what live metal is all about.  You are treated to Halford and Priest classics aswell as some Fight jems from Halford recent past.  The set list is awesome, the riffs are amazing, the vox are wonderful and Halford doesn't miss a note.  If you want true, pure metal LIVE get Halford LIVE Insurrection!

B00005AQF7|5.0|Snoop Dogg back in 1993 was the biggest thing to come out of westcoast at the time. Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre WAS westcoast and this album is the significance of the title that they held. 1993 was a classic time in Hip Hop, East Coast was dominating with classics from Nas & Wu-Tang Clan but Snoop was in a class all in his own. Dr. Dre came out with his classic debut album \\"The Chronic\\" in 1992 and he introduced us to this guy named Snoop Doggy Dogg on classic singles \\"Nuthin But A G Thang\\" and \\"Dre Day\\". Snoop's style in rapping has a singing esque to it, his flow was like no other, he could ride beats like it was nuthin and it was so silky smooth.<br /><br />Doggystyle is Snoop's BEST ALBUM of his entire career. He has never been able to duplicate or rejuvinate this kind of album ever again. Snoop had lyrics back then (not saying he doesn't in the present), but his lyrics were brand new and very relevant.  I think his problem rite now in rapping is the fact that he has never changed which is why he has become very tiresome and evry predictable. Doggystyle is an album that can fully represent Westcoast music all on its own. The production was handled soley by the one and only Dr. Dre and this is G-Funk at its primitive best. All tracks are worth listening too, and some are just straight KRAAAAAZZZZYYY that you'll just keep hitting repeat over and over and over. It's 2009 now and over 15 years later, this album still sounds great. This album is a definitive classic and every music lover needs this album in their collection. The only problem I can think of this album is the constant unecessary cursing and nasty sexual content, but I mean c'mon the title of the album is warning enough LOL.<br /><br />Top Tracks<br />1) Who Am I (Whats My Name)? - Dr. Dre's best beat ever created for Snoop. The second the song starts, you'll just start banging your head until you head pops off. Snoops lyrics are straight forward RAW. and you'll wish he can rap like this again. 10/10<br /><br />2) Ain't No Fun (If The Homies Can't Have None) - this is my personal favorite off the album. I would consider this ladies song on the album even though it is quite negative towards women. The song features the early begnnings of 213 which conists of \\"Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg & Warren G) as well as Kurupt in his prime as well. The song is in one word \\"NASTY\\" haha. the lyrics are all sexual but its pretty funny and direct. The prodcution is so smooth that you can't help but fall in love with. 10/10<br /><br />3) Gin & Juice - Everyone knows this track. This is Snoop's signature track basically outlining \\"a day in a life of Snoop doggy dogg\\". This is Classic Westcoast. 10/10<br /><br />4) Doggy Dogg World - This is the R&B track of the album. I absolutely love the overall feel of the song, cuz its such a laid back chill song. The hook of the song will grab you right away. Great track in general. 10/10<br /><br />5) Murder Was the Case - this track took me a while to like, but I love it now. I will technically name this the sequel of song \\"Deep Cover\\" just without Dr. Dre. The production is the darkest on the album, but still has the typical westcoast synths in it as well as bumpy basses. This is Snoop's most gangsta track on the album. 9.5/10e Homies Can't Have None) - this is my personal favorite off the album.

B002BFBAWO|5.0|This is the film Kristen Stewart was shooting when first approached about \\"Twilight.\\"     Those expecting a comedy may feel short changed.  Comic elements surround a bittersweet but ultimately satisfying core story and prevent it from getting too dark.    This is writer/director Greg Mottolo's reminiscence about a summer job in 1985.     Jesse Eisenberg (\\"James\\") and Kristen Stewart (\\"Em\\") have a lot in common.  Both are out of high school and attending college in the fall.  They meet as summer employees at an amusement park and are drawn to each other, but things are not all that they appear. He's a virgin, and she's not ...  and there's a car crash there waiting to happen.    Roger Ebert wrote:  \\"What surprised me was how much I admired Kristen Stewart, who in \\"Twilight,\\" was playing below her grade level. Here is an actress ready to do important things. Together [with Eisenberg] and with the others, they make \\"Adventureland\\" more real and more touching than it may sound.\\"    Take his word for it.    Kristen Stewart's \\"Em\\" comes alive as a real person you won't soon forget.    Don't expect laughs -- expect to be deeply moved.    This movie is honest and sincere, with real substance.
0670020478|4.0|This is the first self-help book I've read start to finish, so my take on this title is with inexperience in the genre.  (I presume many out there read MANY such books so my review will be of little use.)  This is a great book to stimulate thinking about what your passion could be.  If anything, the time spent reading the book is also time that you force yourself to mull over what it is in life that moves you.  Instead of asking you to sit for 10 hours on an unguided (and likely frustrating) process to figure out what your \\"Element\\" is, you are better served to read this book.  I found myself stopping many times to reflect on Robinson's concepts and examples.  I would strongly recommend reading this book with a notepad to write down your ideas - many of mine have receded into my subconscious unfortunately.  Your strategy for this title is that the book is a means to and end, not the end.<br /><br />The cons to the title is that most of the examples of those who found their passion are frustrating in that their passions were insanely obvious to these people.  The examples serve a great purpose but we need a few that represent us in the mass middle who don't have a strong pull into any specific area.  To that end I left the book feeling that for a great majority of us we won't find a passion that is equivalent to Paul McCartney's or Meg Ryan's.  I suspect many of us will never have such a magnetic draw to a specific \\"tribe\\" but smaller draws to many tribes.  Also, none of the examples had someone finding their passion in the fields that Robinson subtlety derides - office work, corporate jobs, non-artsy, non-musical, non-creative work.  The only reason that the arts can flourish is because of the millions of us willing to produce, day in and day out, digging ditches and running wire, programming routers, growing food and cleaning toilets.  How do these workers find their passion?  Can their passion lie in these fields?  We can't all be artists, musicians, or actors, and if people made such a decision our economy would implode.  So how do the rest of us find our Element?<br /><br />I give credit to the writer for pushing his personal story to the rear of the book - Robinson came from great hardship and most writers (and all politicians) would have used such a back story as a cudgel.  Robinson draws from it as needed to make points.  Also, like many, I was drawn to the title by Robinson's stirring speech on Youtube.  At the end he touches on education but by then it is a sidelight to the book, which is a little ironic.  He's right - our education system is an outmoded disaster, so he was preaching to the choir on that point.<br /><br />All in all, this is worth the time, if anything, to force you to reflect on what your Element might be.eople made such a decision our economy would implode.

B000RPTQ1C|5.0|I heard Coldplay the first time a decade or so ago when a local radio station played Yello, suggesting the band could be big.  I immediately rushed out to buy the album, Parachutes, and was mildly disappointed.  Although the album in itself is fine, Yello is a definite high mark on it.  I was, therefore, a bit surprised when Coldplay had become big a few months later.    A couple of years elapsed and In My Room was released as the lead off single to their follow up album.  Again, great track and the first half of the album was great.  As an album as a whole I still felt something was missing in making it worthwhile, like some sort of Radiohead/US lite version (which they were actually commonly accused of being).      When I heard the Speed of Sound of their X&Y album I decided to give Coldplay a rest.  It is a decent song but devoid of any progression in sound.     When Viva was released it was hyped as being a different Coldplay with Brian Eno steering them to new territories.  Violet Hill, the lead off single, gave, however, few signs of any improvement.  Although the title track and Lovers in Japan became hits and more importantly, songs that I did like, my interest based on past experience in listening to the album was limited.    A friend of mine owned the album and urged me to borrow it, stating it really was much better than Coldplay's previous records.  Since his musical taste aligns often to mine, I decided to give it a decent try.  From the very first notes until the ending, I was stunned during the first listen.  It is as if the group have transformed into a different entity.  Eno's influence is all over the record, with the aural landscape blending with simple melodies.  There is barely a weak track on the record, except maybe the previously mentioned Violet Hill.  Samples of great tracks can be found on YouTube of Strawberry Swing (fantastic video) and Lovers in Japan; both actually expressing the experimentation abundant on the album.    The main gripeis maybe the non inclusion of Life in Technicolor, which starts the album but while the version is superb, only instrumental, it would have been better also getting the long version with lyrics.  That version is available on the mini album released a few months later, Prospect March, but apart from that one track little value is in that record.    Having listened constantly to this record this year (2009), I decided buying X&Y when I saw it on sale.  It is, however, like their previous ones, OK (Fix You is great) but not anything to get excited about.  Viva la Vida is the one Coldplay album to get, save the rest for their compilation some time later.

B002NXSRW0|4.0|When military partners Duke (Channing Tatum) and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans) get involved in the super covert ultra team G.I. Joe thanks to botching up supervising the delivery of nano-mite war-heads on behalf of the US Army, they join the team to try and track the war-heads down before they're unleashed on the world. To make things even more difficult for Duke, his ex-girlfriend, Anastasia \\"Ana\\" DeCobray (Sienna Miller), also the \\"Baroness,\\" is part of the team responsible for stealing the nano-mite war-heads, and he is torn between trying to figure out what happened to her and also doing the right thing not just for his country, but for the whole world.<br /><br />Yet Duke and Ana aren't the only ones with a past. Opposing ninja warriors Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee) go back to when they were children and trained under the same sensei. It wasn't until a tragic event in their youth drove the two apart, only to meet now, years later, and settle their conflict once and for all.<br /><br />With only the safety of the world resting in the hands of the best of the best of the best, team G.I. Joe has their work cut out for them as they try to save the world from the rising C.O.B.R.A.<br /><br />This movie is lightning. Seriously. Right from the first minute straight through to the last this sucker moves at breakneck speed with non-stop action, fireballs, lasers, bullets, super-powered armor, kung-fu, car chases, car crashes, aerial battles and a whole ton more.<br /><br />It's been awhile since I've seen a movie where I felt like I was moving at the speed of light and G.I. Joe delivers that in spades. I went in expecting an action movie. I got it. I went in expecting a military movie. I didn't get that but instead got something between the Avengers, Desert Storm and James Bond. It didn't feel like an army movie and for that I was thankful because, though I like history and military fiction, I have a hard time watching army movies. Don't know why. Just can't get into them. Also, all that olive green is nauseating after a while. Thank goodness that stupid color is absent in G.I. Joe. They wear black, thank you very much.<br /><br />The overall plot was cool. The problem was the pace. It was just way too fast.

1597801577|1.0|Please . . . springs? I guess the author never heard of biodiesel. Or nuclear power. Or solar. Or . . . well, you get the point. The problem with agribusiness selling sterile hybrids that are very vulnerable to insects/disease is a real one and a good plot point. The rest of the world building and characterization is pretty much dull nonsense.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This is an excellent album to showcase Susan Boyle's vocal range and singing ability.  Those that were looking for more of an opera or theater show tunes album may be disappointed in the variety of music in this CD.  I love her voice and I was very pleased to see she can actually sing all different types of music which appeals to different groups of people.   I am looking forward to purchasing more of her albums, hopefully each will be more organized into one type of music per album so those looking for songs like \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" will be pleased to add those albums to their music collection.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|This is a great book.  I was worried it wouldn't be as it was a spin off of a tv show.  I am glad to say I was surprised.  Its a great read.<br />My only warning, try not to read while watching the show.  I found it was hard to keep the two separated in my head.  Yes, the characters are named different in the book, but they are  the same.<br />I happened to be reading the book around the time the episode was on that had Becket reading the book, and I knew exactly what they were talking about.<br />So even if you have never watched the show this is a great mystery with comedy to keep you giggling.
0439023491|5.0|Suzanne Collins does not disappoint with this sequel to Hunger Games.  Coming in strong, starting where the first book ended, I felt like I had never left the story - I had never lowered that level of excitement.... of fear for what was next for Katniss and Peeta.  When the unthinkable happens I cant think that there is any way out... how could there be?<br /><br />I am really pleased how clean Suzanne Collins has kept both of these books.  There is plenty of teenage \\"opportunity\\" for her to take the books a different direction and she doesn't.  I actually find that refreshing.<br /><br />My one regret is that when I started Hunger Games, I did not know until I was into the book  that it was actually one of three, Catching Fire being the middle book and the third not due out to fall of 2010.  If I would have known that I probably would have waited (or at least tried!) so I could have read them all together.  Now I have created a longing in me  to know what happens next....MUST READS!

0671015206|3.0|Tons of great info in this book, but they need someone like the Freakonomics guys or Malcolm Gladwell to make it a little more appealing to the mass market. I know they sold millions of this title, but I wonder how many people actually made it all the way through?    Here's what I learned:  1. Standard of living/spending does not equal wealth  2. Those who look like they're millionaires usually are not  3. Don't give cash to your kids to support a lifestyle they cannot support on their own  4. Buy used cars!  5. Live below your means    All great tips. All things I hope to put into practice. But I had to wade through many dry-as-a-Thanksgiving-turkey chapters and charts that to me weren't where the real meat (no pun intended!) was. All the same, a worthwhile book.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Though many will tell you this version of Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Predjudice\\" is watered down for the American taste, they cannot deny the fast pace and appeal this movie has brought to a classic work of literature. Though true that earlier versions may have been more accurate to the original text, this production's vision has brought a fresh perspective to an earlier day that will touch younger viewers and inspire the more experienced to revisit Jane Austen's world again. Superb acting, beautiful photography, well written screenplay and sensitive directing has culminated in this very fine movie. Five Stars. KCL
B001LF347E|4.0|After seeing season one and now following season two, I must say this series totally grows on you! It's entertaining, funny, romantic, dramatic and with plenty of actions! If you like arthurian legends or just a good medieval story, watch Merlin and you won't be disappointed! I can only hope the DVDs will soon be released in the USA!
B001ET0826|5.0|Come must be one of the most underrated Prince record. At the time of its release, it followed on from the universally liked Symbol and Diamonds and Pearls. Difficult to get to grips with straight away it seems to have been the record that signalled the end of Prince's relationship with Warner. At the time there were rumours that Warners were disappointed with the album as it did not contain the tracks that they were expecting, notably, \\"the most beautiful girl in the world\\" and did not market it as well as they could have. Prior to its release, a promo film (the Beautiful experience- which starred Nona Gaye) was aired in Europe and it featured some of the tracks, including \\"race\\", \\"papa\\", \\"loose\\" and \\"pheromone\\". The track \\"come\\" was included but was a very different sort of song, funkier as opposed to the jazzy album version. Two tracks which weren't included were \\"days of wild\\" and \\"interactive\\". Why they never made it onto the record is neither here nor there, but certainly at the time, the messages out in the media was that Warners were disappointed with Prince and Prince was non too pleased with Warners. Between the disputants, ultimately it was the record \\"Come\\" which lost out and was not plugged the way it should have been.   Interestingly, this record, as far as I am aware, is the only one in Prince's released discography where all the tracks are single word titles. The record is very much a more serious and mature album and  even \\"orgasm\\" has its place in this record. This is a record I used to play all the time in 1994 and 1995 and have gone back to it many times in the intervening years (not something I could do with say \\"the gold experience\\") and definitely ranks up there with \\"sign\\", \\"parade\\", \\"lovesexy\\" and \\"the rainbow children\\".  Not to be dismissed.
B000AGTPUU|1.0|Souless is what describes this product. So much talent and money just wasted because it lacks soul. It' lack of soul is total and complete. It is painful from the moment it opens to the closing. Absolute disaster. People who put their name of this product should be so very ashamed of that fact.     I just could not find any redeeming quality at all of this thing and that's a shame because it was supposed to be that special something even I wished hard it was.
B00008977N|4.0|To put it simply, this is a great concert. The sound is great, a great stage act, great playing from all musicians (not familiar with Paula Cole but she is okay too). However, the video quality is horrid. It's roughly equivalent to watching YouTube video on an HDTV. Seriously. It is very low resolution. How important that is to you is, well, up to you. I enjoy \\"watching\\" a concert as much as listening so it's a bit disappointing that it looks as bad as it does. However, despite that drawback, it's still a great concert and sounds great. It's probably still worth it to most people if you are a fan but just be prepared for the low quality video. It won't be one on your reference videos but you will still enjoy it.
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|I think this blu ray needs to be reviewed in two different capacities; quality of the disc, and quality of the concert.  Both are exceptional.  The picture and sound of the blu ray are outstanding. Vivid colors and boisterous music. You can almost feel the sweat flying at you (and these guys get sweaty).  This is really the next best thing to actually being at the concert (and maybe even better!). The other part is how good the show itself is.  I'm a huge Killers fan, and they played everything I really wanted to hear.  Even though it's a concert for the Day & Age album, they still played the best songs from all 3 other albums.  And played them they did.  It was an amazing show and they really put their hearts into. 5 stars!!
0671449028|5.0|Reading to your child every night may, at times, pose to be a challenge.  So finding the right books that will enagage them is vital.  The Going to Bed Book illustrates the play, bath, and sleepy time routine mothers understand so well and reinforces how when the day is gone it's time to rest.  It is a board book but the delivery is suitable for age ranges from 2 through 5.  Great addition to the bedtime routine.
B0026P3G12|5.0|BRAVO SUSAN BOYLE! Wonderful. Marvelous. I love it. She sounds so pure and clear. She raises my spirits. I love the song choices but I think I would love anything she sings. Every song is my favorite. I can't wait until her next CD. Yes, all are similarly arranged but I still love every one.
B00005JO1R|5.0|I already have this movie and have enjoyed it since it came out on DVD.  This was a gift for a friend that kept borrowing mine.  Enjoy.   When I first saw this movie, I thought the music was dubbed in, but it was not.  If you are a Cash fan you will enjoy it.  If you just like a good story that happens to be true, you should probably enjoy it too.  Since I grew up with Johnny Cash, I thought I know his story, but there was more.
B001U0HBPG|5.0|Wow!  \\"Benjamin Button\\" is such an extraordinary movie that long after it is ended, it lingers in your thoughts.  A  baby born with all the characteristics of an aged man, and abandoned by his widowed father, is not expected to live. But live he does.  In a twist on the normal aging process, he ages chronologically, but physically he ages backwards, becoming younger, healthier and fabulously good-looking until he reaches old age and the transformation is complete.<br /><br />Most people comment about the amazing technological effects of accomplishing this physical transformation, but what gripped me was the outstanding acting.  Pitt is mesmerizing in this role and it is too bad he did not win an Oscar for this performance.  How he lives his life, old, disabled or in the prime of youth is inspiring. It speaks to one's will and the power to overcome any obstacles.  His character's curiosity to learn as much about the world is also moving: no matter where he is or what he does, he seems to fit.<br /><br />Kudos to all involved and a recommendation not to miss this exceptional work.
B000NU2CY4|5.0|Yes, Im crazy about this movie also for reasons too numerous to mention. So I'll summarize;  a) Russell Crowe (wonderfully sympathetic), Joachin Phoenix (skillfully descends into insanity), Connie Nielsen ( yum, yum)  b) Big budget has allowed Scott to film a grand Roman epic.      1) Terrific opening battle scene with the Roman war machine launching a 2nd century AD blitzkrieg on the barbarians.      2) Excellent computer created spectacle of Roman grandeur.       3) Great sets of the emperors palace, senate, and lavish costumes.  c) Ridley Scotts directing trademarks;      1) Staging of intimate scenes filled with personal tension.  The eerie candlelit scenes between Phoenix and Nielsen, with Zimmers haunting music in the background, make the movie for me; \\"Busy little bee!\\".  Scott does this same kind of staging in Bladerunner and Empire Of The Sun and it is hypnotic.      2) His love of historical subject matter.     This and Ben Hur are the greatest Roman Empire movies ever made.
B002UXRH10|5.0|I like this CD! I can actually listen to the album all the way through! My favorites are; Rude Boy, Stupid In Love, Rockstar 101, and Cold Case Love. I would definitely buy this album!
1416511946|4.0|Most of us are not famous and most of us don't have Nikki's Bank account.... this here is a tale of drug addiction to the extreme, money is no object so the junk never runs out, any person who has done hard drugs will find it easy to relate to Nikki Six in this book. This is truly is a must read for any person who wants an inside look at the horrors of Heroin addiction.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|This is one of Pixar's best movies to date. Extremely touching and heartfelt, but funny at the same time. I've watched this movie with children and adults and everyone found something they enjoyed. I love the packaging of this set: Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital Copy. It's everything you could want, and is fantastic for households with some DVD players and some Blu-ray. Definitely a good buy!
031606792X|1.0|TERRIBLE book. I can't believe I read this entire series. I'm thoroughly ashamed. After every book, I just couldn't believe the next one could ever be as bad as the last. How wrong I was. And going along that logic, since this was the last book, it was essentially the worst.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|It's an amazing movie, about many different aspects of life. But what I noticed was the double bind between the owner of the cafe and her husband. He didn't do 'nothin' so his wife  yelled because somebody in the family has to do 'somethin'. She wept after he left, just before Jasmin the German lady limped into her life. And she's just left her German louse of a husband who had irritated her so much that she'd rather hitchhike than be in the same car with him.     The two men seemed to want to keep track of their mate, but not enough to address their 'issues': apparent lazienss and extreme sensitivity to his 'manhood' in one. But boorishness, and 'non-involvement' with their wives in both. Jasmin isn't the kind of lady that can  ignore something that needs cleaning up, fixing up, so she goes to work, cleaning up, and getting order out of chaos. They evolve into women who can do something themselves,     The scenes that showed the two twists (I think they are 'moebius twists', a ribbon twisted a half turn) that appearred in the sky and in pictures on the wall of Jasmin's room was a true mystical encounter to me.     The  music was haunting as long as it wasn't the clamoring of the son, who seemed equally non-involved with his mother's harsh living conditions. That made the screeching excusable. I wondered why men do what causes women to do what they hate most.     I loved the Jack Palance, he was really into the character. It's a classic movie.
B0011HF6GE|4.0|Bon Iver was another one of those artists that come out of nowhere.  I heard about them through an automated recommendation and I am thankful I have discovered him.  I've never really liked music this slow and folk-like before, but for some reason I really feel like this music speaks to my generation.  At the time of this review, I am barely into my 20's and I can really connect with this music.  It's a little sad and a little mystic at the same time.  Bon Iver makes music that takes you places.  And most of the time he takes me to a very very relaxing and enjoyable place.<br /><br />Unfortunately I can't be 100% passionate about the whole album, yet.  It takes a while to grow on you.  But immediate and lasting favorites are \\"Flume\\", \\"Skinny Love\\", and \\"For Emma\\".  I became attached to those tunes at first listen.  The great thing about this album, is that none of the songs are annoying, or bad songs.  It's all listenable through and through.  I give it 4 stars because some songs are 10X more memorable than others.  The other songs will still sooth you and treat you the way good music does.  So unlike other albums that have good songs and bad songs.  This is an album with all good songs.  Some just take us a little higher than others, like my personal favorite \\"Flume\\".<br /><br />Everyone owes this style of music a listen.  Here's a great way to start.  Bon Iver creates music that's very hard to dislike.  It speaks to your heart, and it's easy on the ears.  Preview the album, I say.  Before long you will have these songs stuck in your head, and your going to want to purchase the album.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Up is a great movie.  It is more of an adult movie than a kid movie.  Don't get me wrong, my 4 year old loves to watch it, but many of the ideas and themes are for adults.  Being in my mid thirties, this movie speaks to me on many different levels.      Get it and be prepared for a visual spectacle and great story!
B002Q4TKZY|5.0|First let me say that I own the DVD. When I saw that it had become available on Blu-ray I ordered it. As you can probably tell it is an import from Australia. Because of this, the case is slightly thicker than a normal case. The movie comes as a single disc.<br /><br />The audio/video transfer was well executed, the movie was gorgeous to begin with, and it's nice to see they managed not to mess this up (unlike \\"Hero\\").<br /><br />The only reason for the 4 stars was that the extras are not 1080p and as a result will not play on my PS3 so I won't be enjoying those.<br /><br />As with the original, the movie is in French with English subtitles.<br /><br />As for the movie, very briefly, it is the story of a young woman who goes on a mission to help others despite her own problems.<br /><br />If I were to classify the story, I'd say romantic comedy with a side of fantasy.<br /><br />It is an adult movie so there is some nudity, for those who have not seen it.<br /><br />If you've seen the movie, then you already know this, the jump to blu-ray was worth the $34, for me anyway.<br /><br />However, as always, rent it first (as a DVD most likely) and decide for yourself.
B000I0QLZU|3.0|Ever since taking the video game world by storm with the 1996 release of Tomb Raider, it seemed only a matter of time before the series' buxom heroine, Lara Croft, would find her way to Hollywood. Fast-forward to 2001, and gamers worldwide were anxiously awaiting the release of Lara Croft's first foray into the realm of live-action in \\"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider\\".    \\"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider\\" chronicles one of the many adventures of Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie), a modern-day, female version of Indiana Jones. After uncovering a long-buried secret from her father's mysterious past, Lara learns she must seek out a powerful object known as The Triangle of Light. Upon embarking on this perilous quest, Lara soon discovers that she is not the only one interested in the artifact. A secret society known as The Illuminati hope to attain control of the Triangle, and if they succeed, our world could be in grave danger.    The fact that this movie is based on a wildly successful video game franchise almost guarantees that at best it will be viewed as a guilty pleasure by those that enjoy it. I for one can confirm that while I did enjoy the movie, the experience is firmly cemented in the aforementioned arena. Now, some could view this status as a bad thing, I for one do not, in most cases; especially, if the creative forces behind the film appear content with that rating.    The moment the movie began it was crystal clear that this was never intended to be taken all that seriously as a film. From the writers to the director and stars, basically everyone associated with the movie undoubtedly knew that this was to be nothing more than pure, unadulterated fun. Just watch ten minutes of the movie and you understand instantly who this movie was geared towards. Obviously, its primary focus was to entertain the core audience of gamers that love the franchise and any teenage guys (or adult men) who enjoy non-stop action, explosions, guns, and above all... seeing Angelina Jolie on screen. Inall of these areas, I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this movie succeeded with great ease; hence, the guilty pleasure status.    Written by Patrick Massett and John Zinman (both are writers on TV's \\"Friday Night Lights\\") the story appears to have one simple goal: take the audience from action scene A to action scene B and so on. If you're lucky, there could be a little bit of character development sprinkled throughout, just enough to feed the potential sequel; other than that, the plot is fairly thin and not particularly imaginative. Although, for a movie like this, I really didn't expect much more, so I'm not that surprised by the lacking storyline. However, due to the fact that the video games, on which the film was based, are actually quite rich in story (especially nowadays); I for one wish that the writers had put in a little more time and effort into making the story interesting rather than filler between action set pieces. Like I said, the writers clearly had one goal (albeit a far too simple one) and in that they succeeded, but a little more work would have been appreciated.    Helming the movie is director Simon West, whose previous work on the action-packed \\"Con Air\\" and the thriller \\"The General's Daughter\\" proved he had what it took to make an entertaining movie. In terms of this film's action, there is no denying that Simon West provided some very exciting action sequences; however, there were a few shortcomings where the action featured visual effects. These flaws, I believe, exposed Simon's inexperience in the realm of CGI, and became a slight detriment to the final product. While scenes involving predominantly real people were fast-paced and exciting, those featuring virtual characters looked awkward and lacked the momentum that carried the other sequences so well. Case in point would be the opening scene involving the training robot that Lara fights. There are moments in this scene that look great, but other times it looks amateurish at best. Despite his action movie experience, perhaps someone more proficient than Simon West in the use of visual effects would have been better suited to direct this film.    Even though Simon West's directing was sometimes hampered whenever CGI was present, that doesn't absolve the various effects houses from shouldering some criticism. Some of the special effects in the movie look great even to this day; however, there were others that looked weak upon the film's release and look just as bad, if not worse now. Due to the fact that over ten different visual effects companies were used on this film, perhaps \\"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider\\" is yet another example of too many hands stirring the pot. Honestly, when this film was released there were numerous other movies in theaters that were just as CGI intensive, if not more so, and many of them looked excellent from start to finish. What it boils down to is this, there is no excuse for a movie with a budget as big as this one's (around $115 million) to not feature top-notch visual effects. Shame on the various effects houses for not producing better work than what was on display.    In an all-out action movie, such as this one, it's not surprising when the cast doesn't exactly receive award nominations or blow anyone away with their performances. To be honest, I doubt anybody expected any different from a video game adaptation. Although, there was one member of the film's cast that was a bit of a surprise to me. It wasn't the choice that surprised me, but the fact that the person actually accepted the role. The cast member I'm referring to is none other than the star herself, Academy Award winner Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft.    What made the surprise a pleasant one, aside from the obvious appeal of Angelina in the role, is that it's fun to see actors and actresses who are willing to set aside the critics and the awards from time to time. Whenever a star chooses to participate in a project because it's fun and shows potentialto be a real crowd pleaser is almost always a treat. Of course, this decision could have turned very ugly for Ms. Jolie had the movie not been a success, as so many other equally talented actors and actresses have discovered. Even though the risk was potentially great, I'm sure the reward of a growing fan base as a result of a successful adaptation was well worth it in the end.    Prior to her casting, Angelina could have easily passed as a real life version of the character based solely on her looks or at least served as possible inspiration for the character's appearance. Another reason her casting surprised me was because the role was so unlike most of her previous work, which had been predominantly dramatic in nature, not counting \\"Gone in 60 Seconds\\". Even with her relative inexperience in the world of action films, Angelina handled the role rather well. There were just a few moments where she seemed a little uncertain of herself, but generally she stayed true to the character's confident nature as depicted in the video games.    Aside from Angelina, the remainder of the cast wasn't really comprised of any really recognizable Hollywood talent. Well, let me clarify, veteran actor Jon Voight (\\"Transformers\\") does have a few scenes as Lara Croft's father (he also happens to be Angelina's real-life father), so I guess my statement's not completely true. His appearance in the film, basically a glorified cameo, did assist in providing the movie's extremely sparse dramatic moments, lending some weight to an otherwise lightweight affair.    Actor Daniel Craig, who has become much more recognizable the last few years thanks to his role as James Bond, appears in a relatively generic role as a rival tomb raider who fancies himself Lara's better, despite all evidence to the contrary. Daniel plays the role as one-dimensional as the very paper it was written on. He never once injected any real sense of life into the role to make it more exciting or interesting for the viewer, and as a result his character is easily forgettable. Yet, I must give him some slack, because clearly the script didn't call for much depth to this character, or any others; so, perhaps he wasn't confident enough in his career or craft to make decisions that would affect his character's story.    The other actors in this movie were adequate for their roles, but just like Daniel Craig's, they were fairly straight-forward, cookie-cutter cut-outs of typical action movie characters we've seen a thousand times before. British actor Noah Taylor did provide the movie some fairly humorous moments as Lara's assistant and technical genius, Bryce. Again, aside from some good comedic timing, Noah didn't really bring anything terrific to the role, but he was at least more memorable thanks to his humor than most of the other supporting roles.    It occurred to me while watching the movie that the lack of any truly interesting characters, aside from the titular one, coupled with a fairly unoriginal and basic plot, could have served as an example of how not to make a film adaptation based on a video game or otherwise. However, the film's terrific turn at the box office allowed it to emerge victorious over its various inherent faults. Despite its drawbacks, I have to say that \\"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider\\" is a superficially entertaining action adventure. Just be sure to check your brain at the door first.    \\"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider\\" is rated PG-13 for violence and brief sensuality.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|Viewing Shelter was like watching a miracle unfold before my eyes. While staying at a friend's house over the Thanksgiving holiday, serendipity intervened and allowed me to catch this sublimely acted and beautifully nuanced piece.  I don't think I'll ever be the same.     To me, what often separates the good from the great when it comes to film is that good movies manage to come up with something new while great movies are able to make standard material, even the highly cliched (boy meets boy/girl), seem completely original, authentic, and fresh. Shelter definitely falls under the latter description. What is miraculous is that it went a step further by having the narrative, music, and visuals completely wash over the viewer - like surfing a giant wave. The result is a sense that the film is an intimate chronicle of one's own journey for affirmation and acceptance, even if the details of one's life are completely different.    Just in time for the holidays, this DVD definitely tops my Christmas Wish List but in more ways than one: The soundtrack is beyond amazing and I hope to own that soon. Although I typically avoid movies that are made out of books, I would love to see the reverse take place and have a book made out of this movie. (It could be fictitiously penned by and written from the perspective of the character of Shaun, since he was a writer.) I also hope to see a sequel or a TV series even. I've read dismissive comparisons to the O.C., but if the Here! network (or any courageous channel) needed to put a contemporary spin on the typical family drama, I think this would be a great launching point. I kept yearning to see more as the characters moved forward with their lives and their relationships matured.     One could tell that everyone involved in the production, cast and crew, were totally invested in making the film. It's easy to understand why audience members like myself have been pulled in so passionately and completely.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Crusty, \\"set in his ways\\" Korean War vet Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) confronts a threat of gang violence in his community and his own prejudice when he tries to help his next door neighbors who are Asian.  Everything has already been said about this film--- just watch it.  Great movie about family, life, loss, and relationships and opening your heart to others.  Another Eastwood hit!!!!<br /><br />***HIGHLY RECOMMENDED***
B002K0WBXW|4.0|You can't go wrong with cutie patuties Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Although the story itself is not very original the cast is great making this a great must-see romantic comedy. The cast also includes Betty White, Craig T Nelson, Mary Steenbaurgen, Malin Akerman, and Oscar Nu&ntilde;ez. Betty White is superbly funny.<br /><br />I bought this movie after having seen the movie online. This is one of those movies that I had to have a physical copy of in my DVD/Bluray collection. The movie also comes with French and Spanish Language tracks. I use the Spanish Language tracks of movies when I have family(mom, aunts, etc.) visit. Definitely a must for anyones romantic comedy collection.
0385504225|1.0|I bought this book because my son made me do it the day it came out, the I had to put it in my suitcase and haul it to China where he is going to boarding school.  No I did not read it on plane because I like to travel extremely light.  No I did not read it before I took off but I saw some bad reviews and warned my son.      Once he got it he put his head in it like he did with Angels and Demons.  However he seemed unhappy about midway.  When he finally finished he rolled his eyes.  I took the book from him and became the next victim of wasting 2 nice mornings of my time and screaming in the end \\"WHAT?\\"    We fought over AD.  It had the adrenaline rush.  What is this book?  \\"Secret\\" everyone is trying to protect is no secret at all.  The all-powerful villain is just an idiot(yeah, drawing a circle with dot on your head will make you King of Darkness) out for personal revenge.      And not only do the female \\"scientists\\" have no chemistry with Robert in every novel (I don't mean anything derogatory, I am a female scientist), now she is getting older too.  50 something.  Have they already someone in their mind to do the movie?      Hopefully the money I wasted can teach my son (who aspires to be a writer)a good lesson about how NOT to write.
B002LE8EFQ|5.0|You can read any review, I just want to say that her voice is solid gold and diamonds to my ears
B00197YZ7M|5.0|There's something nostalgic and simple about this film. I don't believe in adultery by any means but I wanted these characters to stay together.
B0002JJBZE|4.0|Excellent!  Exactly what I was looking for, and in great shape!  Thanx so much!
B002KSPKRS|4.0|First I would like to get the few cons out of the way.<br /><br />-Price:  This headset is EXPENSIVE.  Even with a small discount code I had it was pushing $170.  I would only recommend this if you need to stay quiet during your game time, such as apartment dwellers like myself, staying quiet for the spouse, kids, dog, etc.<br /><br />-Wireless:  Both a pro and con.  I have my wireless router 1 foot away from my xbox which I have to keep the receiver for the headset by because I have to connect the USB power to the xbox.  By doing this my wireless router interferes with the ear force receiver, giving it a loud cracking/popping noise every few seconds.  I had to disconnect the router and hard wire the xbox to the modem and turn the wireless router off.<br /><br />-Volume:  You cannot even hear anything on the headset until you turn the volume dial halfway.  Now I will admit that the loudest setting should be plenty in a completely quiet room, but if there is a lot of background noise, for example a lawn mower in the backyard the volume may not be enough to drown that out.<br /><br />Now that all the cons are out of the way, I can say that the sound on this headset is EXCELLENT.  Of course you will not get a TRUE surround sound experience, but being able to hear every little detail at 2 am is just great.  The microphone is adjustable and detachable so you can store it away if using your headset for a late night movie session.<br /><br />And you can also use this with the PS3!  I tested out a few blu ray movies and found that some of the audio formats were not working with the headset.  I am not a big audio expert, so I am not sure if I was doing something wrong so I am not going to knock points off for that.  I was testing out Rambo in case anyone wants to try it out.<br /><br />If you are able to keep the surround sound at 11 at night, by all mean keep doing that and skip this.  If you need a excellent, comfortable and reliable headset, this is the one to pick up.
B0026P3G12|4.0|Although I don't have the album, I have listened to some of her songs. I am SO glad Susan Boyle came into the music world the way she is. This should let ever \\"average\\" or \\"ugly looking\\" person know that talent can and will override your looks anyday. For example, these days, there are VERY FEW people out there that are good looking AND can sing (ex: Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey). There are some \\"average looking\\" people that can sing (ex: Clay Aiken), and then there is Susan Boyle, a woman that received weird looks because of the way she looks...until she opened her mouth and nothing but beautiful vocals exited her throat. No, I am not saying she is ugly. This woman has been told things like she will never make it simply because of her looks, she will not fit into Hollywood, etc. I really hope she has enough supporters to prove people wrong. I really hope this was an eye opener for a lot of young people today. As some older ones already know, looks only get you so far. We all get old and will die, so instead of trying to poke botox in your butts, enjoy life and focus on your talents.
B0001IN0DA|3.0|Big Show VS John Cena: Cena is still in his rap gimmick and he does one before this match. However, this isn't one of his best raps he's done. The match is good and Big Show does a really great job in this match and the ending was well done. Cena wins the US title in a good opener.    RVD and Booker T VS Dudley Boys VS Cade and Jindrak VS La Resistance: This match started good and towards the end chaos ensues. All wrestlers enter the ring and brawl, you cannot tell who is legal anymore, and the tag team champions somehow retains the tag titles in all the chaos.    Christian VS Chris Jericho: The wrestling in this match was fine but I just found it a little boring. The ending was a twist.    Evolution (Ric Flair, Randy Orton, and Batista) VS Rock N' Sock Connection: A very good and entertaining match. Foley was the weak link in this match but he did hit a nice elbow from the apron onto Flair on the outside. Orton pins Foley in the end with an RKO out of nowhere. A good showing by both teams.    Torrie Wilson and Sable VS Jackie and Stacey Keibler: Skip    Cruiserweight Opening: Poor Ultimo Dragon, he was such a force in Japan and WCW. WWE didnt know how to market him and his run in WWE is probably forgotten by many. He pins Shannon Moore in the opening match and then taps out to Jamie Noble. This match is pretty standard with Chavo Guerrero retaining the belt in the end via cheating but it looked like it was botched.    Goldberg VS Brock Lesnar with Stone Cold as Ref: This match sucked beyond belief and words cannot describe the horror of this match. Do not watch this and avoid ever watching this and you'll thank me.    Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty VS APA VS Bashams VS The World's Greatest Tag Team: This match is the exact same thing as the Raw match but a little worse.    Victora VS Molly Holly Hair VS Hair Match: Two good women wrestlers but I still didnt watch it. The end result was pretty goood though.    Eddie Guerrero VS Kurt Angle: These two wrestlers always deliver a good match and this was no different. A great match and I loved the ending.      Kane VS Undertaker: Paul Bearer makes his return as Undertaker's manager. The match was short but was good. However, the ending sucked as Kane hits a chokeslam on Undertaker but doesnt cover him and walks around the ring for a few minutes and Undertaker gets up and beats Kane.     Shawn Michaels VS Triple H VS Chris Benoit: A very good triple threat match that saw Benoit realize his life long dream of winning the world title.    Overall, a mixed WrestleMania. Half was good and the other half wasn't bad but nothing you'd go out of your way for. Lesnar-Goldberg sucked beyond belief though and i'd stay far away from that one.
0061914177|5.0|I picked up a copy of Gary Vaynerchuk's book \\"Crush It\\" to read on my way to a conference in San Diego. Get the book here from Amazon, not at the airport unless you're funding your own stimulus package for airport book stores. :)<br /><br />If you're not familiar with @garyvee and Wine Library TV, like I wasn't when first meeting Gary at Blog World Expo a year ago, Vaynerchuck is a poster boy for a small business that has leveraged passion, product and social media to stimulate incredible business growth and community around his brand.<br /><br />After BWE, the next time I saw Gary was when he keynoted at Affiliate Summit early in 2009. That was an experience. His \\"tell it like it is\\" style isn't for everyone, but personally, I like it.<br /><br />That charisma and personality on stage is great for entertainment value, but it was the real-world insights and tips that he gave from his personal experience building a business using social channels that kept him top of mind for me and caused me to buy the book as soon as I saw it.<br /><br />I don't know Gary Vaynerchuk personally and he certainly doesn't know me, but I thought it would be a good book to review for the readers of my blog at [...] and also here on Amazon.  The book is short, 140 pages or so, but that short form is consistent with his direct approach. It starts by outlining the importance of passion and Gary's three rules for success in business and life: Love your family, Work super hard, Live your passion.<br /><br />\\"Passion is everything.\\"<br /><br />From there he shares his \\"hard working immigrant makes good\\" story of coming to the U.S. as a child from Belarus and numerous examples of how \\"hustle\\" and business savvy have been a part of his DNA from neighborhood lemonade stands to building up his father's liquor store business from 4 to 50 million to creating another new business of his own, Vayner Media.<br /><br />\\"It's never a bad time to start a business unless you're starting a mediocre business.\\"<br /><br />The essence of this book is to find out what you're really passionate about. Work your ass off, communicating that passion using whatever media format and channels are the best fit for you and the audience you're trying to reach. The passion will show through in the content you create, the connections and community you build and the legacy (more important than short term financial gain) you leave from building the business.<br /><br />\\"Story telling is by far the most underrated skill in business.\\"<br /><br />Along with advice on creating content, choosing the right platform, being authentic, finding like-minded participants on the social web and social media marketing advice, he offers several ideas on monetization (some of which I'll be implementing now), the value of patience and being adaptable.<br /><br />\\"Be patient. In time, if you continue to hustle, you'll grow your presence and improve your skills to the point where the fish - really, really big fish, will be jumping straight into your hands.\\"<br /><br />Vaynerchuck admits his own contradictions, like do what your passion tells you no matter what, but also be adaptable in how you execute on your passion. He also makes a few comments that fly in the face of marketing (social or otherwise) key principles, like don't pay much attention to analytics, but go with your gut.<br /><br />\\"Anything is better than zero.\\"<br /><br />Despite contradictions and rare advice that would make most marketers cringe, there's no mistaking the success Vaynerchuck has achieved following \\"The Best Marketing Plan Ever\\" which he shares in the latter part of the book. He even goes so far as to offer a checklist and several business ideas he says he doesn't have time to go after himself, so go for it.<br /><br />\\"Legacy is greater than currency.\\"<br /><br />For those looking for step by step instructions on how to develop a social media strategy and the specific tools to execute, this book has some of that, but it's moreabout inspiration than \\"how to\\".  To get anything out of a workshop or testing social tools yourself, you need to be inspired first anyway.<br /><br />I think \\"Crush It\\" is an excellent book offering personal stories that illustrate the importance of passion, patience, hustle and the value of doing what you need to do to be happy. Success takes hard work and this book does a great job of showing anyone the framework for making what really makes them passionate and turn it into an online business.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0061914177 Crush It!: Why NOW Is the Time to Cash In on Your Passion]]irst anyway.

B00005JPTK|5.0|Will Smith is simply brilliant as the sole survivor, Robert Neville. Will delivers movingly and convincingly on a script that really focuses on giving us a picture of \\"what it would be like\\" ... to be the last man on earth, living off the land in NYC. This is the real strength of this movie: there's really not a lot of blood or gore or zombie scenes at all. Yet I was riveted as Robert goes through his \\"typical days\\" in NYC. Every moment was full of pathos and full of menace, too. And occasionally we got some relief from Smith's trademark humor that blended seamlessly with the rest of his performance to give us \\"what it would be like\\" with a powerful delivery that just leaves me almost breathless.    There's an effective use of flashbacks that partly tell us the story of how we got to where we're at in this grim New York City; and the flashbacks also serve to give us an overwhelming contrast between Life Before and Life After the apocalyptic disaster wiped out the city. Yet use of flashback was sparing, which I found all the more effective.    Cinematography was excellent throughout, the storyline and script are brilliant, the use of a dog, Samantha, as a key actor was perfect to show us both Robert as companion and Robert as lonely, isolated survivor.    I won't give away the ending, but think it was satisfying as far as it goes, but not nearly as appealing, from my angle, as the foregoing material. That brings up my one complaint: the title. By the end of the movie, we have some sense of the meaning of the title. Yet it still seems to me to feel cheesy and really unworthy of the movie.
B001CD6FKI|5.0|A came into Speed Racer expecting to be entertained and just that. What actually happened blew me away! I was gripped and mesmerized. I felt like a little kid again hanging on to each scene. The bright colors and over-the-top characters, combined with the amazing special effects, made this movie a thrill ride of excitement that blew me away!
B002UXRH10|4.0|After a couple of years, the lovely Rihanna returns with a new album (not just a re-release--THANK GOODNESS!!!). After going through the domestic violence case this past year, she claims in interviews that she has grown a lot, and has transferred it into her work. And how did that turn out? Read on for the Track by Track Review.<br /><br />1. Mad House - Nice Intro..dark tone and setting for the rest of the album (I'm not going to rate this track, though)<br />2. Wait Your Turn - Very reggae-feeling with Rihanna's voice. Not the normal RiRi that we all grew to know and love on GGGB. The minute I heard the F bomb I was really shocked (I don't really like vulgarity in music that much). The chorus is the best part for sure. 3.5/5<br />3. Hard (featuring Jeezy) - The beginning is a little awkward. But after that, it only gets better. The chorus, once again, is probably the most memorable part, along with the verses by Jeezy. Stellar production makes this a solid track that is definitely one of the better of the \\"new-Rihanna\\" tracks. At first listen, you may not like it (like I didn't enjoy it when I first heard it), but give it a second listen and you might like it. 4/5<br />4. Stupid In Love - Whew. Now that the gangsta-tracks are over, we hear a ballad by Rihanna. This track, aided greatly by a piano background, is a stand out track. I believe that this track exemplifies the emotions of Rihanna greatly. 4/5<br />5. Rockstar 101 (featuring Slash!!) - Back to rocker Rihanna. Something just seems to be missing from this track to make it epic. Oh well. Another example of the edgier Rihanna that everyone is talking about...and I'm not a huge fan. But another good track (where you should probably give it a second chance after you hear it for the first time). 3/5<br />6. Russian Roulette - Lead Single. Two words--simply spectacular. The dark, scary background piano gives this ballad an edge that truly, in my personal opinion, sums up her experiences from the past year. Oh, and just a SIDENOTE..the vocals are AMAZING. 5/5<br />7. Fire Bomb - A mid tempo song, the title of the song actually deceived me. I thought that it was going to be yet again another song about being a rocker, bad*ss, blah blah blah. But it's not this way, and this song is all about the lower registers of Rihanna's voice that are rarely heard in her music. \\"The lovers need to clear the road\\"...I really liked this song. The sirens and crackling fire at the end of the song topped the cake. 4/5<br />8. Rude Boy - With significant sexual innuendo throughout the song, the production give it almost a Jamaican vibe, most likely inspired from Rihanna's small island roots. A little repetitive, but still a nice track. 3.5/5<br />9. Photographs (featuring will.i.am) - A slower paced/mid tempo track, this is one of the better songs of the album. The auto-tuned track contributed by will.i.am truly makes it much more memorable. 4.5/5<br />10. G4L (Gangsta for Life) - Another \\"gangsta\\" track, this one gets very very repetitive. One of the weaker tracks on the album. But still enjoyable! 3/5<br />11. Te Amo - Just to preface/explain this song first. This song was written by a man from a man's point of view, and Rihanna decided to sing it. So this should clear any confusion...hopefully. The story of the song follows one of Rihanna's friends who has deep feelings for her (loves Rihanna), and Rihanna likes her as a friend, but as nothing more. On to the track. This song was leaked a while back in June, and its Latin influences are apparent. This is one of the best songs on the album. (and one of my personal favorites!!) 5/5<br />12. Cold Case Love - Starts out with old style, organ-like pipes. This is a rather lengthy song for Rihanna, but then again the whole album is about \\"breaking the rules\\" in a way. Very minimal backing track at the beginning of the song gives it a cool feel. At 1:30 or so, the backing leads way to quite gorgeous instrumentals and snaps. At around 3:45 then, production really takes over. A REALLY nice track!!! One of my personal favorites. 4.5/5<br />13 - Appropriately titles with giant vocals. This really just serves some more emotions from Rihanna. A solid track, but overall just an OK way to end an awesome album. 3.5/5<br /><br />Overall -<br /><br />Although not as consistent as GGGB, this album is probably stronger overall. It is really about breaking the status quo and using music as a platform for emotional expression (which i thought was the original purpose of music in the first place!!) A great effort from Rihanna. A MUST buy.e of my personal favorites. 4.5/5  13 - Appropriately titles with giant vocals. This really just serves some more emotions from Rihanna.

B001QWBM62|5.0|Had been looking at smaller mp3 recorders for onlocation voice overs and double system sound support. The Zoom H4n exceeds my expectations, is smaller than expected and frankly is built better than many published reviewer's report. It's audio quality far exceeds the lower priced handhelds, and it has been a pleasure to use. One desired feature for future versions would be a simple screw-on angled stand permitting XLRs and power line connector clearance.
0470477237|4.0|\\"Online word of mouth has made many traditional marketing strategies obsolete\\". Those are powerful words and central to the theme in \\"Socialnomics\\" by Erik Qualman, Global VP for Online Marketing for EF Educatio. I've seen Socialnomics online and in bookstores, but it wasn't until I connected with Erik on Twitter that I decided to buy and review it.<br /><br />I appreciate Erik's \\"It's a people driven economy stupid\\" characterization because it's how I've viewed social media since our digital marketing & PR agency started blogging (MarketingBlog.com) and using social news/bookmarking sites in 2004: as technology that facilitates word of mouth. When presenting at conferences, I often say to audiences that if a company has strong word of mouth in the offline world, then Social Media may be a powerful option for them. If not, perhaps social media can help them get word of mouth started.<br /><br />While many companies are \\"doing social media\\" as many marketers put it, most are shooting from the hip. Socialnomics explores the impact social media is having on the way companies are developing and marketing products that reaches consumers directly and eliminates middleman waste.<br /><br />Here's the chapter breakdown:<br /><br />Word of Mouth Goes World of Mouth - Social media beats porn? Wow. Social media can seem like information overload, but the reality is that your network can filter the noise as can search engines that increasingly rely on social signals. News is push and bloggers are news. Publishing business models need to adapt as do marketing departments that want to best leverage social media communication channels.<br /><br />Social Media = Preventative Behavior (What happens in Vegas stays on YouTube) - Social media enables people to be open about their interests and lives attracted by the notion of being part of something. Individuals and companies realize this openness and are adjusting what they publish accordingly. Once something is published on the web, it's forever.<br /><br />While some companies work to drown out negative sentiment and commentary about their brands, products and services, others see the opportunity to engage with customers about their concerns and leverage that insight to create better solutions.<br /><br />Social Media = Braggadocian Behavior (It's all about me, me, me) - Social media is becoming a bigger part of people's lives involving relationships, communications, and entertainment. Both Gen Y and Z aspire to changing the world around them using social media, maybe because their interpersonal skills in the real world are hampered overuse of social tools.<br /><br />Obama's Success Driven by Social Media - Great breakdown of the Obama campaign's use of social tools like video and what companies can learn from it.<br /><br />I Care More about What My Neighbor Thinks than What Google Thinks - Social what? Socialommerce - the transactional, search and marketing components of social media. This is more about the pull of social. Instead of us going to what we want via search, what we want comes to us via social media. 76% rely on recommendations from others vs 15% that rely on advertising.<br /><br />Death of a Social Schizophrenia - The initial popularity of representing different personas will give way to real transparency of character as social media participants mature and realize the difficulty of maintaining different identities.<br />The best marketing investment companies can make in a social media world is in the quality of their products and a focus on being the best. Quality and focus facilitates word of mouth and referrals vs traditional push marketing, so marketers will need to adopt new roles that involve listening, engaging and reacting.<br /><br />Winners and Losers in a 140 Character World - Great mix of good and bad examples of social media use by companies. Being honest is appreciated by consumers and the future of social media advertising means including both advertisers and audiences in the content creation process. SEO and social media go hand in hand, a topic that TopRank could write an entire book about.<br /><br />Next Step for Companies and The \\"Glass House Generation\\" - The last chapter focuses first on putting search agencies out of business, PPC agencies that is, through a socialnomic model where search engines get paid for sales, not clicks, by advertisers. At the same time, Google's efforts with social search (the Google and Bing deals with Twitter and Facbook post date the book) are important and warrant marketers' attention. YouTube after all, is the second most popular search engine, not Yahoo.<br /><br />Companies should consider carefully, whether to build their own social network vs using a social network platform that already exists, such as Facebook or LinkedIn. Social media will play a huge part in jobs and recruiting, especially for those job seekers and employees that successfully use social tools.<br /><br />When writing a book, you have to pick your battles with a topic like social media since there are so many angles, approaches and topics that could be covered. I guess that explains why there are so many books on social media.<br /><br />Socialnomics does a good job of presenting high level analysis and practical impact sandwiched by stories that marketers can appreciate. The key points bulleted out after each chapter are handy and I recommend reading them before you read the actual chapters.<br /><br />I appreciate the nod to the SEO value of social media content, but my heavily biased opinion is that there's a lot more to be said. Search Marketing agencies that speak social fluently (like TopRankMarketing.com) are distinct from PPC or advertising agencies.  I don't think advertising is going away, but it's certainly going to change and adapt according to advertiser shifts in budgets. Some of that may go to social advertising and some may go to something new not covered in the book.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0470477237 Socialnomics: How social media transforms the way we live and do business]]TopRank could write an entire book about.

B001U0HBPG|5.0|This movie was a little bit long but still very good and entertaining the cast was stellar!! Rent it buy it but do see it!
B000002A46|3.0|The cd came quickly but the cd case was broken.  Delilvery was excellent though!
B001AQO3WY|4.0|These episodes, like the book, show all aspects of war.  Good, bad, and gray.  Generally speaking, seems like a roadtrip movie with ambushes and RPGs.  Characters are varied and complex and change throughout the story.  Their diverse personalities gives an array of emotion from humor to fear in the same instance.  Overall, a good look into the lives of these Marines during the intial invasion of Iraq.    Like I said, it shows both good and bad in war.  The good is the brotherhood of the Corps and the family structure that is a battalion.  Also, helping the local populace with basic needs and ridding them of violence as much as possible. There is also good in killing of insurgents and attempting to rid the region of extremism.  However, I appreciate the showing of the darker aspects of warfare.  Showing artillery indiscriminately bombing cities and villiages.  Showing the inevitable accidents of killing civilians. Also, issues from command with unprofessional officers and leaders who make decisions without knowing the full story.    Well done episodes that provides realism that is rarely shown when telling a true story.  Would get a five star from me if the book was not so much better.  I recomend both the video series and the book to anyone who is interested in warfare.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I absolutely love this series. i rented it, watched every episode, then had to buy it. It's difinitely not for children but fun entertainment for older teens and adults. i love the characters. Especially \\"Sookie\\" played by Anna Paquin,and Bill the vampire she falls in love with. i highly recommend this series and can't wait to see season 2!
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|I have to admit not being a fan of the Director, Tim Bekmambetov. Somewhat disappointed in his Russian Films Nightwatch and Daywatch. However, in his American directorial he delivers!! An abundance of profanities and over the top action sequences that are beyond extreme fill the screen in a dizzying array of visual adrenaline. Holding you in a tight breathtaking grip with its interesting visual techniques, humor and acting. James McAvoy (the sweet faun from the Chronicles of Narnia) plays the loser we all know, Wesley Gibbon. The guy, who just trudges through life allowing himself to be walked upon, humiliated and has no desire to escape it, except in a bottle of anti-anxiety meds. Enter a beautiful Woman, Fox (Angelina Jolie), a mysterious wise man Sloan (Morgan Freeman) and his life instantly changes from Billing Reports to Gratuitous Violence, Mastering Weaponry Skills, and Assassination. Believe me when I say what the Matrix introduced, Wanted has mastered. The director is a skilled artist at using the camera in conveying visual emotions of Wesley like I have never seen before, wait I take that back, seen it in Night Watch. I definitely recommend this deliberately humorous, action packed, violent, profane, to-the-extreme film to be seen on the big screen - check this one out!!
0307588335|1.0|Does Mr. McDonald want us to believe that he had no responsibility in the collapse? He was an employee and a shareholder of the corporation. Where is the moral outrage in the trading pit? The traders that left before the collapse were also shareholders. What was their motivation in keeping silent about the gross mismanagement of Lehman? They ALL had an obligation to sound the alarm--LOUD AND CLEAR!! They all lacked character and courage.
0811868419|5.0|This book is so beautiful and sweet.  The artistry is impressive and the content is whimsical.  I absolutely recommend buying this.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|The fact that any decent critics -- not to mention flacks in disguise like Roger Ebert and Peter Travers -- gave this highly unoriginal, amateurish film a high rating, that Steven Spielberg monkeyed himself out like a trailer-park idiot (on the level of Shrub choking on a pretzel) in reference to a \\"possessed\\" bathroom to help generate buzz for a project he was about to purchase, and the general public forked over more than $100 million precious recession bucks for this cardboard thrill ride is quite disappointing. This bland misogyny parable makes \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" and \\"The Last Broadcast\\" look like \\"Citizen Kane\\" by comparison.<br /><br />Yes, I think we all know by now that horror movies which don't succumb to tossing around buckets of gore or parading monsters before the camera every few minutes create more tension, but the studios don't buy into intellectual horror specifically because the money's in more meat-headed fare. Newsflash: Most of the general movie-going public are knuckle-dragging oxygen wasters. By god, the latest \\"Friday the 13th,\\" which cost a mere $19 million, scared up $65 domestically, and there's nothing more shocking about a Jason Voorhees slashfest than the Mandrill cage at the zoo right before feeding time.<br /><br />Studios don't take gambles, period, and this is not intellectual horror anyway. The icing on the cake is the cheesy reworked ending that leaves room for sequel after sequel (and mark my words, \\"Paranormal Activity 2\\" is guaranteed to be a gorefest). Besides, the formula for this outing has already been successfully tested: Hype it and they will come. Throw in a few stories about people bolting from the theater mid-film (I wouldn't be surprised to find out people were paid to run from the aisles) and presto! No wonder a useless hamster cat-toy is the best-selling holiday item for humans this year. I'm a rat in a cage, indeed.<br /><br />The acting, adequate at first, quickly turns annoying and unbelievable (this couple is too trailer trash to actually live in a nice area of San Diego -- the boyfriend is too much of a borderline personality to realistically be \\"engaged to be engaged\\" with anybody, and the girlfriend is like some latchkey kid who never grew up; I'm not surprised at all by how things turn out for the guy in the end. Like I said, it's just a supernaturally tinged exercise in personality disorders.<br /><br />Even though there are no special effects, no manifestation of evil, this film still manages to go for cheap frights. Think of the black cat jumping out of the darkness in a Hammer film ... and nothing more complex. And if you actually think the scenes of the camera filming the bed ARE scary after the 10th time -- this thing is like \\"Groundhog Day\\" without any of its charm, for chrissakes -- you deserve to live in the bubble with which you surround yourself.to actually live in a nice area of San Diego -- the boyfriend is too much of a borderline personality to realistically be \\"engaged to be engaged\\" with anybody, and the girlfriend is like some latchkey kid who never grew up; I'm not surprised at all by how things turn out for the guy in the end.

B000MRA5EM|1.0|The music on this DVD is louder than the narrators.  It is very annoying.  I cannot understand what they are saying.  The visual is great, but is ruined by the poorly mixed audio.  I wish I could get my money back.
0385341008|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. It held my attention and I could not wait to get back to it. I wanted to know what happened to the characters. Did the couple finally realize they were in love? I wanted the ending to be happy. I considered the book time well spent.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I pre-ordered 6 copies of \\"I Have a Dream\\" for Christmas gifts.  I could have saved a lot of time online shopping many different sites and products!  One gift for All at a bargain price.  The mail carrier brought my order yesterday.  Because I've ordered many things for Christmas at Amazon, I didn't know what the box contained.  I am going through a very difficult time in my personal life and am seeing a therapist weekly ($ 25 co-pay each time).  I immediately played my CD (I can only spare 5 for gifts!) and tears began to flow down my face.  Susan's voice and the lyrics spoke to me about things she couldn't possibly have known in my life.  (I'm asking the FBI to check if my phone or my therapists' office is wire-tapped!!)  Susan makes me feel as if she understands my entire life.  Think I'll cut back on therapy.  Her CD brings beauty to the world and peace to me.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I just received my pre-ordered CD from Amazon.com today.  It is well worth the wait!  I got goosebumps listening to Susan sing Amazing Grace, How Great Thou Art and Silent Night.  Of course, I loved all the songs.  Susan's voice is incredible and I am so glad that the whole world now knows Susan Boyle!  For all those who own this incredible CD, don't forget to pull out the insert and read the liner notes.  The lyrics to all the songs are followed by a few thoughts on the song by Susan herself, in her own writing.  Susan dedicates this CD to her much beloved Mother.  Very touching.   Susan, you have made your dear mum very proud.  We thank her for giving us YOU.  We are proud of you and  our prayers are with you.  God bless you, Susan.  Take care of yourself and Pebbles.

I sent an email to the seller and they tolled me to go after HP for replacement under the factory warranty. This is the first time in my life I ever had a problem with a new toner cartridge or ink cartridge. I think they are selling used stuff.
B001GCUO4S|5.0|It's still a decent movie.  Like other reviewers said, it has been done before, but the unique (and gruesome) kills are what makes these movies.  Usually, that what makes a sequel.  Same premise, but different actions.  Alot of reviewers didn't like it because it was just \\"another mindless sequel.\\"   This is not true.  This movie is a great movie, if you are someone who is not a nit-picker, and don't take the movies they watch, to seriously.  If you're just looking for entertainment, this movie will do just that.
B000SINT52|4.0|There are two types of liberals (or were back then), those who did their research, and those who didn't.  I'm undecided about Michael Moore, but I can say that what he's promoting is mostly to be against Bush, and I agree with that.  However, I would suggest Greg Palast's film Bush's Family Fortunes: The Best Democracy Money Can Buy as a better film to show, if you want to expose Bush.  Greg Palast might not be as entertaining, but he clearly has done more research and interviews both sides.  Michael Moore does that as well, but he really tries to push them to look bad.  Greg Palast also lets the story tell itself, Michael Moore tries to tell the story.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I just finished 60 days of the 30 Day Shred.  I did level 1 for 10 days, level 2 for 20, and then level 3 for 30 days.  After the first 30 days, I hadn't really lost any weight, but I was noticeably more toned, my clothes fit better, and I felt better about myself.  After the next 30 days, I was even more toned and had lost about 5-7 lbs.    Pros:  - It works.  I'd been doing the Firm videos for several months, and wanted something more effective.  Although I haven't reached my weight loss goal yet, I can see my cheekbones and clavicles again, my glutes are more toned, my thighs look and feel great (and the ugly lines on the outer thighs are gone!)  - It is fast.  I have very limited time in the morning, what with having to get my son to school.  25 minutes fits in perfectly.  Even though she keeps saying it is a 20 minute workout, and there are 3 circuits of 3-2-1 minute exercises, each level actually takes about 24-25 minutes with the warmup, cooldown, and transitions added in.    Cons:  - It's boring.  30 days of Level 3 was extremely boring.  I know some people mix up the levels, but I wanted to do each one individually for a certain time period.  Now I will probably mix them up.  - Some of the exercises, especially in level 2, were somewhat hard for me to understand how to do correctly, so I didn't feel like I was getting the proper workout with them.    Other tips and info:  - I rented this on Netflix first, and after one session, I ordered it from Amazon.  - I wasn't sure how regularly to do this, and other people have asked the same question.  The first 30 days I did 5 days on, 1 day off.  The second 30 days I did 5 days on, 2 days (the weekend) off.  At the end of level 2, she does say \\"See you tomorrow\\" so I think she expects you to do it without too many days off.  - I had 3 sets of hand weights for level 1 (3 lb, 5 lb, and 8 lb), 2 sets for level 2 (3 lb and 5 lb) and 1 set of level 3 (5 lb)  - Many people complain about the ads in the beginning.  If your DVD player has a memory feature, pause/stop it at the beginning of the workout and it should start right there next time you turn it on.  At the end of each workout, I go back to the menu, select the level I want, and then fast forward to section 2 (the beginning of the warmup).  Next day, it starts right there, no waiting.
B0013BNY2Q|1.0|Now before I say anything about the album let me tell everyone that I love R.E.M. if you're talking about old R.E. M. from 81-88 and 92-94.  R.E.M. have not put out a good release since Monster.  When this album came out I foolishly had high expectations for it.  The last 3 albums were poor.  Up being too electronic and boring.  Reveal being decent with some moments but not great.  Around The Sun I never heard buit heard nothing but negative things so never bothered to listen to it.  I thought hopefuly by their 4th album without founding member Bill Berry they could get it right and rock again instead of being real mellow.  Well the songs are more guitar driven now but there is absolutly no life to them.  They're just boring and I wasn't able to listen to the whole album.  I found it completly unlistnable and was not the great comeback I hoped it would be.  R.E.M. have put out great masterpieces like Murmer, Reckoning, Green and Automatic For The People.  Monster was the last album I liked.  Ever since then they have gone downhill.  I would probably say this is their second worst album next to Up.  Sorry fans but I couldn't get into this one at all.  The songwriting and playing was weak.  I'll have to say I'm done with R.E.M.  If I want to hear an R.E.M. album it's going to be Chronic Town through Monster with the exception of Out Of Time (their ultimate sell out album.)
0307269752|5.0|I began reading this book with a measure of cynicism. However when I picked it up and read for a hundred pages, I couldn't put it down. This book keeps you hooked with plot twists, fascinating characters and insights into human psychology. This book is a gritty and explores the darkest sides of corruption, human morality. and insanity. It's a shocking page turner and definitely not for children or those with a weak tolerance for dark stories. The book is a page turner, no doubt about it. Personally, I emerged from reading it truly entertained, optimistic and I highly HIGHLY recommend it to those who aren't afraid to dip into a dark, action filled thriller.
0385504225|5.0|Another Dan Brown Classic. Would recommend to any fans of \\"The DaVinci Code\\" or \\"Angels and Demons\\".
0385504225|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Angels & Demons\\" and enjoyed \\"DaVinci Code\\", but have to say that I liked \\"Lost Symbol\\".  It was another quick read by Dan Brown, but throughout the book I kept having flashbacks of the previous two books.  Brown's writing is easy reading and does come with suspense, but when I finished the book I felt neutral...nothing special here.
B000JU7NCE|3.0|This dvd I was a little excited about so I read some reviews on here to see what people had to say about it.  I would have to agree on the negative reviews with this dvd.  The quality isn't very good.  Too many cheesy effects over the video which to me is very distracting.  This dvd was taken from 9 different concerts on their Festival tour in various countries to very huge audiences.  This is also the first tour with Porl Thompson since Wish.  The song list is pretty good.  They actualy play some rare songs in here that I haven't seen them play live in a while but some of the playing is a little sloppy and Robert's singing sounds lazy at times.  Probably the worst part about this dvd is that there are no keyboards at all.  This was a very big mistake from Robert as I always thought keyboards were an essential part for The Cure.  Oh sure Three Imaginary Boys was without keyboards.  But that was 1979 and the band was just getting started.  After many albums later all with keyboard we all expect to hear keyboards.  I am a huge cure fan and have collected a lot of their work including bootlegs.  This is worth having for the collection but don't expect an amazing concert film like In Orange.  When they will ever put In Orange or Show on DVD I have no idea but we really need those.  In fact I also agree with other reviews that Trilogy is a better live dvd then this.  If you don't have Trilogy get that one first then get this.  This is an ok dvd but The cCure can do better.  I know this was edited by Robert Smith and I think he's gone off his rocker ever since he let the horrible Ross Robinson produce The Cure album for them.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I love Sarah Brightman and have ALL of her recordings, BUT! just my opinion, she certainly has Susan Boyle giving her a run for her money..Just bought Susan's first cd and I know will buy them all as they become available.........
B001BPJJ1E|4.0|I had never seen this film before, as I was only 1 year old when it came out and from what I have read, it did not get distribution in the States anyway. But I am an avid follower of Mark Lester's. He really was the perfect Oliver, and such a charming screen presence that I find myself slowly wanting to watch all of his movies, which leaves me with one BIG problem: Most of them are not available on DVD. For someone who still holds a pretty big cult following, he has one of the worst DVD production rates of any former child actor. If I were him, I would buy all the prints of my films and release them myself. But, I digress, which leads me to this movie.    Truthfully, there is not much to this movie at all. Boy meets best friend, boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love, best friend shows a brief flash of jealousy, boy and girl decide they want to get married, best friend marries them with the whole class watching. Along with this distinct lack of meaty plot comes a HORRIBLE DVD transfer which made me feel like I was watching an old kinescope on a bedsheet. Now, that would be the minuses. But you know something? I was utterly charmed from beginning to end and was certainly not sorry I bought it. It is an awesome little time capsule of working class London circa 1970, and seems to have been filmed with very few extras. Scenes at the beach and at a school athletics competition feature onlookers who seem to have been pulled in off the street, which adds a lot. Mark Lester is charming as usual, and Jack Wild, the Artful Dodger himself, is a riot at times playing the best friend as a cheeky boy who always gets into trouble. And then there is the soundtrack. I knew a few of the Bee Gees early songs, such as To Love Somebody and First of May, but this film also includes overlooked gems such as In the Morning and Give Your Best. Put simply, the movie would be worth buying for the soundtrack alone, but with Mark Lester along for the ride and a few amusing scenes here and there, it was well worth buying in my humble opinion.
0385737947|3.0|I thought this book was ok.... I just finished it and am a little disappointed as a whole.  It was very hard to stay with it in the beginning.  I found the language changes pretty odd - with no real explanation for them.  They werent even very creative.  I mean, lets just change the f in the beginning of THAT word to sh.  Was that just an effort to attract teens and still get it past the school librarians?  The whole premise of the book is pretty interesting - it was just hard getting past the first part.  I just really was'nt buying any of these guys.  The story gets moving about half way in and alot of the action is well written.  The story is original and exciting - I just wish the author had done a bit better job with the characters.
B00011CZRE|5.0|Of late, movies such as National Treasure,  The DaVinci Code, and Angels & Demons intrigue with their clue-solving protagonists, their chases, and visuals. Se7en is a thinker's \\"chase the clues.\\" Its smart script brings the Seven Deadly Sins to murderous life in a type of Danse Macabre orchestrated by John Doe. The testosterone-driven and intellectually dull Detective David Mills could be said to illustrate Everyman.  Despite Detective Lt. William Somerset's brilliance and assiduous research, John Doe \\"solves\\" the crime for the detectives with the message: the consequence of sin is death, physical and psychological.
0439023491|5.0|While I really enjoyed [[ASIN:0439023483 The Hunger Games]] greatly, I have to admit that I wasn't quite sure what merited a sequel. The original book is seemingly a self-contained tale, and while there were definitely some interesting threads left to explore, the question of how to explore them seemed to be the big hurdle. So kudos to Ms. Collins for not only writing a sequel that expands on the original in every way, but does so in such a way that it never feel unnecessary, unneeded, or unplanned. Essentially, Catching Fire does two things: it gives a more in-depth look at the dystopian world that Collins has created, and it pushes the plot towards something more far-reaching than just the games: the threat of rebellion and civil war. I said in my review of Hunger Games that Collins had created a fascinating world, and Catching Fire only confirms that; the more details and background we get on Panem, the more complex and fully-realized we begin to realize Collins's world is. There are some who have complained that Catching Fire suffers from \\"middle book\\" syndrome, in that it's largely setting up for the final book, but I disagree; there's enough new material here, enough exploration of Katniss and the other surviving main characters from the first book, and enough slow weaving of the plot threads (with some truly stunning twists along the way) that I found myself gripped. Katniss is a great character - far from the bland, do-nothing heroine of some major series (I won't name names, but it rhymes with Bi-light), she's complex, self-empowered, and not always the most heroic - in other words, she's a teenager, through and through. Much like The Hunger Games, Catching Fire is part adventure story, part detailing of the effects of war and battle, part social commentary, and it all somehow works, and (in my opinion) even outdoes the first book. It's a great read that solidifies my feelings about the series; I was curious about book two, but I absolutely cannot wait for book three to arrive.book three to arrive.
1416550542|5.0|I enjoyed this book from start to finish. Not a bad page in the bunch.  I loved all the twists and turns, even the ones I saw coming.  I loved its \\"fairy tales\\", and the way the whole book seemed just a bit far-fetched like a fairy tale. Great characters and a good pace.  I'll remember this one for a long time. I'll be looking for more by this author.
B0026P3G12|3.0|I love Susan's voice, but I was a bit disappointed in this CD in that all the songs were slow.  I would have liked to have heard more variety - some up tempo songs as well.  Also, I was hoping that on the CD, she would sing the entire song \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" and not just the abbreviated version that was done on Britain's Got Talent.  Was also disappointed in \\"How Great Thou Art.\\"  She has a lovely voice for this song.  It is a wonderful song in it's entirety, but all that was on the CD was a repetition of the chorus about four times.  Personally, although I love her voice, since all the songs were slow, I couldn't listen to it all in one sitting - I got bored with it.  Also, Susan has a powerful voice, and there were places in the CD where that power could have been used to good effect, but it wasn't.  I felt that she was being stifled.  Her voice sounded beautiful, but emotion and power were lacking in my opinion.  I hope that on her next CD she has a mixture of up tempo songs as well as the slow ones.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|This is an excellent movie that I can not stop watching. First time I watched in HBO was just to watch something I hadn't seen before, but right after the first scenes I got so wrapped up in this movie. Excelent, Superb performances of all the characters, specially the lovely couple of mismatched man and woman and the little boy that keeps interfering in their romance once and again.  Kidman was funny, gracious, and romantic. And Drover, oh Drover! so tall and handsome and rugged! Beautiful man! Beautiful torso! And good actor.  I wish it hadn't finished when it did, I wanted more and more story. I watch this movie On Demand before it ends, I Tivo recorded it and I will buy the DVD.  I recommend this movie to all, it's not a chick movie, its a movie for everybody!  Watch it, folks!

0307473465|5.0|I read this book today.  It is clearly and distinctly written; it approaches extremely difficult questions; it does not answer them.  It seems to have a lot to say about pity and judgment, in everyday life and in sorting through the history of the Holocaust, again and again.  For this book, pity is not an emotion that adheres stably to one group of people:  without detaching us from the need to pity the victims and survivors of the camps, pity twists like a dagger through the novel, through our lives and history, and no one can be sure that it will not suddenly rise up in our lives.  And maybe we should be surprised in this way more often.

B002NXSSBU|5.0|This 24kt remaster of Never A Dull Moment sounds great and if you have a cd player with an HDCD decoder, it will sound even better. This was Stewart's 4th solo album and I believe clearly the best album of his career. At this point in his recording career, he had sang on two Jeff Beck albums, the classic \\"Truth\\", a great album, and Beck O'La. Then he recorded Small Faces with Ronnie Lane and gang, then the Rod Stewart album, Gasoline Alley, Every Picture Tells A Story, which included his big hit Maggie May that launched him and The Faces to stardom; then came this album. Two groups play on this album, the Faces play the first cut True Blue, great drumming by Kenny Jones, the rest of the album is Stewart's great recording session band which also features Ron Wood (same as Faces) on bass. The drummer for the other songs is Mickey Waller, who has an unusual choppy style of drumming that is brilliant. There isn't a bad song on this album.
B000002552|5.0|This is one of my top 5 Bob Dylan records, and that says a LOT given a) the sheer breadth and quality of the man's recording career and b) the incomplete nature of this compilation. It is definitely the most fun album that Bob ever recorded, which is perhaps due to the fact that these songs were never meant for official release, something that has been mentioned here before. The style of the record is loose and informal and the songs are catchy, relatively short and upbeat. Some tracks don't have any drum accompaniment and sound very stripped down (Yea! Heavy and a Bottle of Bread, Crash on the Levee, Clothesline Saga, etc.). Dylan's voice is unbridled but relaxed here and gives a lot of life and weight to these songs without taking away from their simplicity. As a fan of The Band, I was overjoyed to hear so many examples of their immense versatility--Manuel shines on piano and some truly amazing vocals on tracks such as \\"Long Distance Operator\\" and \\"Orange Juice Blues.\\" Robertson had me smiling ear to ear the first time I heard him crashing around on drums for \\"Apple Suckling Tree,\\" and \\"You Ain't Going Nowhere.\\" And Hudson's organ is just beyond explanation. He really puts everything together. The Band's own songs are excellent too, whether or not they technically \\"belong\\" on this album. The mix of voices (Dylan, Danko, Manuel and Helm) create a texture and range that are not heard on other Dylan albums.    This is not a \\"concept\\" record nor is it a good example of a cohesive Dylan album. These are just lighthearted, warm, creative songs that really do sound like they came straight out of the artists' home. There is a casualness and an intimacy here that is lost in big studio productions like \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" which shares certain stylistic elements with \\"The Basement Tapes,\\" but takes a lot more from horns, harmonica, etc. The lyrics are all classic Dylan, but you won't find any epics like \\"Sad Eyed Lady\\" or \\"Desolation Row\\" here--its mostly humorous stories andcharacter studies on such interesting folks as \\"Tiny Montgomery,\\" \\"Bessie Smith\\" and \\"Ruben Remus.\\" It has been said that around this time, Dylan was writing about 10-15 songs per month, and you can just feel the creative peak that he was reaching here. This album really never gets old and it still feels fresh in its true Americana sincerity. Listening to it is like visiting old friends. I just wish that they would release the rest of the Basement Tape songs so that we can have a complete understanding of the true genius that manifested during the months spent at Big Pink. Some of my favorites here are: \\"Odds and Ends,\\" \\"Orange Juice Blues,\\" \\"Yea! Heavy and a Bottle of Bread,\\" \\"You Ain't Going Nowhere,\\" \\"Open the Door, Richard\\" and \\"Nothing was Delivered.\\"

0060558121|1.0|The premise is intriguing: Gods are brought over from other cultures through the minds of immigrants and eventually manifest into real beings that walk amongst the rest of society.  Then as people stop believing, the gods grow weak and old.<br /><br />But with as much potential as this storyline has, Gaiman's delivery was a huge disappointment.  He manages to make it entirely implausible.  And I really don't mind implausible.  Hell my favorite genre is implausible. ... Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Mists of Avalon... I normally love fantasy or books that rework old mythologies.  But good fantasy should be written in a manner that makes the reader believe.  Gaiman failed miserably in this regard.<br /><br />His character development fell flat.  The most well developed characters in this book are still only two-dimensional at best, and when it came to the \\"new\\" gods, there was no character development at all.  None of the characters in this book, whether they were gods or mortals, had any redeeming qualities... not even the protagonist ... nor did the plot itself.  Who was I supposed to be rooting for?  Shadow?  Wednesday?  Laura?  I couldn't relate or sympathize with anyone.<br /><br />I know the gods in ancient mythology are flawed, but these gods are beyond that.  They lie, cheat, steal, kill for no reason....  What good are they?  Who would pray to these gods?  No wonder people stopped believing in them.  There's nothing to cling to.<br /><br />And ~why~ are the gods fighting to begin with?  What are they fighting for?  This isn't a good versus evil storyline.  It's simply evil versus evil.... And I don't mean that in a good \\"fire fighting fire\\" sort of way, either.  It's totally pointless.<br /><br />When I pick up a book, I expect it to either entertain me, enlighten me, inspire me or some combination of the three.  It did none of those.  If it has no bearing on reality, a novel needs to possess some redeeming aspect in terms of insight, morality...  something.  This book fails miserably.  It's just offensive.  Vulgar.  Depressing.  Boring.  Awkward.  Ugly.  Clumsy.  Chaotic.  A good premise poorly executed.t's just offensive.  Vulgar.  Depressing.  Boring.   Awkward.  Ugly.  Clumsy.  Chaotic.  A good premise poorly executed.
B002VECM36|4.0|If you want some extremely bloody ninja action, you'll get enough for three movies with Ninja Assassin. I can't think of a film that has as many limbs being cut off or higher body count than this one. Maybe the first Kill Bill flick and that's really saying something. After reading a lot of reviews from the critics, I expected a horrible story and acting to go along with the carnage, but neither were that bad. I never heard of the lead actor, played by Rain, but he is suppose to be a big singer in Asia. His performance was on and off, but his physicality stole the show. I felt the scenes that showed the main character's training from a young boy to a man at a secret assassin fortress added some depth. That sensei doesn't mess around!<br /><br />Even though ninjas prefer to engage in combat in the dark, I like how you can still see what is going on in most of the fights. The many action scenes are the highlights for sure. They are brutal beyond belief, but some of the blood was a little too CGI for my tastes. Still, there were many creative kills using various slice and dice weapons. The opening scene has the most memorable kill, setting the tone for the rest of the film. And how can you not love seeing massive ninja stars being thrown at a machine gun rate of speed?<br /><br />The story is your typical martial arts fare and the acting ranges from pretty good to mediocre, but you should know better than to watch this for either of those elements. I remember a couple of weeks ago saying how the destruction of the Earth, as seen in the movie 2012, won't likely be surpassed. Well, I doubt there will ever be another ninja film that throws as much violence, gore and action into just a little over 90 minutes. If there's a sequel, you can count me in.
B002QB1910|5.0|I could't wait for this albulm to come out as soon as I heard \\"Russian Rullette\\". That was the most cleverly written song I've heard in a long time from the R&B world. I love how Rihanna uses more or her native accent in this album. I am not the type of person who wants to hear lovey dovey songs, so I'm glad she brought this edge/anger out in her voice/lyrics. When put the album in, I didn't have to skip tracks at all. It's one great song after another. Well Done!
B002UZCJP2|3.0|First off, I'm happy to say that Surrogates was much better than I thought it would be. I didn't plan on seeing it in theaters, but I was bored one day and the reviews hadn't been too harsh. There is a lot more going on here than in most of the mindless drivel that comes out in the month of September. Sure there are some nifty action scenes, but this movie plays more like a drama with sci-fi elements and some thought provoking ideas on humanity. It's a little slow at times, but at around 90 minutes, it doesn't overstay it's welcome.<br /><br />Bruce Willis is solid here as usual. Nothing really special from him, but he's still the guy we know and love. The supporting cast features two beautiful women in Radha Mitchell and Rosamund Pike. Not only are they nice to look at, they make the most of the limited material they are given. I thought it was pretty funny how the filmmakers made all the actors so attractive as the robots and went out of their way to make them as ugly as possible in human form. Except for Bruce Willis curiously, who just looked flat out creepy as a Surrogate. Ving Rhames and James Cromwell add name recognition to the cast and perform rather well in their small roles.<br /><br />The SFX are good at times and lacking at others, but nothing too bad or distracting. There is one neat twist I didn't see coming and the ending felt just right. Not too optimistic or depressing. I saw Gamer a few weeks ago and it shares a lot of similarities with this one, but Surrogates is a much stronger film with bigger ideas. I wouldn't rush out to see it, but this flick is worth a rental, especially if you enjoyed I, Robot or The Island.
B001B71NOI|5.0|This is not a hard-core rock-album like some of Reznor's previous works. In fact, the two weakest tracks (in my opinion) are the only two that explore his techno-metal roots. However, if you're looking for a surreal trip into the mind of a genius, then give this a try. It's not his best album, but compared to much of the music offered up by the over-caffeinated, morning-zoo, pop-culture, radio-world at our finger-tips, this is pretty d@mn good! The album increases with strength as it progresses even as it mellows, and by the end, you'll be adrenalized by the power of Reznor's music, tone and lyrics.<br /><br />And as the Beastie Boys once prominently proclaimed, \\"you can't fart on that!\\"
0385504225|3.0|This book kept my interest with numerous twists and turns and a plethora of interesting history, symbology, and speculative 'science'. But I found the ending to be a big disappointment, in fact after reading the whole book in a day and a half I couldn't even make myself read the last few pages. Also, one thing kept distracting me which I also recall from DaVinci Code or one of his other books: when the author uses the term 'flashed on' to describe when someone is remembering something. It seems like an attempt at saying 'remembered' in a hip way, but it is infuriatingly distracting and pulls me right out of the fiction. I guess you could say I flashed on the fact that he had used 'flashed on' in the past.
B000B7BRMM|5.0|I love Diana's voice and to have her ring in the Christmas season has been pure joy!
B0015ABRE2|2.0|I'm a big fan of Dexter, and I really enjoyed season 3. It took a couple of episodes to get into it, because several new characters are introduced and for a while it seems unfamiliar. But the stories are immensely intricate and satisfying. Great show.    Why the 2-star review? Because the DVD \\"extras\\" are not actually on the DVD. You have to go to a web site to view them.     Want to enjoy the extras from the comfort of your couch? Tough! Showtime doesn't want you to.     But didn't you PAY for this DVD? Doesn't matter. Shut up and watch the way Showtime wants you to watch. You may think you're a Dexter fan, but you're not: you're a potential video pirate. You're lucky to even get an actual DVD in the box.    Plus, the extra interviews are uncut, and the quality is poor. One segment has a solid minute or two of a high-pitched tone that drowns out the sound. Some people might like the rawness of the content. I find it to be just annoying.
B0026P3G12|5.0|A glorious showcase for this lady's remarkable voice with some predictable song choices and one truly inspired, unlikely winner. For Ms Boyle to have recorded I Dreamed A Dream (from Lés Miserables) was a foregone conclusion since that was the song from the British talent show that launched her into YouTube stardom and brought goose bumps to millions, yours truly included.     Other chestnuts, while perfectly worthy renditions are nevertheless fairly predictable (though no less beautiful for that) when a voice like Ms Boyle's is on display. Amazing Grace? Check. Cry Me A River? Check. How Great Thou Art? Check. Silent Night? Check.    Ms Boyle's voice seems custom-fit to soar in cathedrals and echo in spires and the apparent preponderance of religious-themed songs or, at least, songs that sound religion-inspired on her album is not very surprising. A hint that Ms Boyle may be more than a one-trick pony, however is provided by three song choices on the album.     One is Daydream Believer, originally recorded by The Monkees as a chirpy, peppy uptempo pop song. Ms Boyle slows it down and gives it gravitas and depth. Another is Madonna's You'll See, again suitably measured in pace yet dramatic    But the song that really blew me away was the unlikeliest choice of all: Wild Horses by the Rolling Stones. Susan Boyle doing Mick Jagger? Holy guacamole! She pulls it off and how! Wild Horses is a stand out bluesy number from the Stones' Sticky Fingers album [[ASIN:B001WCN23W Sticky Fingers]] and Ms Boyle treats it with great respect. The delicate piano accompaniment and her wonderful voice, restrained at first, then soaring gloriously through the chorus makes this an instant and complete classic, a beautiful reinterpretation of a great song that transforms it into something wonderful and fresh.    On my personal, arbitrary scale, I've rated seven songs of the twelve as five stars, two as four stars and half a star, two as four stars, and one as three stars and half a star.
B002UXRH10|4.0|When I first put the CD in, I'm like \\"this is garbage\\" and took it out. Then I read reviews saying that it's a great CD, it's just different than the Rihanna we know. So I gave it another try. Upon listening to it more, I am really starting to like it. Give Rihanna a chance to grow on you and I'm quite sure you will like it too.
031606792X|1.0|Let me first start off by saying that I am probably a little too old to be reading these books(29), but they were getting rave reviews so I had to get in on it. I loved the first three installments to this series, however, you can't even begin to imagine my disappointment and utter disgust after reading this garbage. As seeing how many people have commented on this, I don't have to get into detail about how wrong this is on so many levels. Trust me people, believe what you read, this is awful. It's like this book doesn't belong with the group! I don't recognize any of the characters I came to know in the previous ones. Seriously, Stephenie Meyer should have stopped after Eclipse. I can't help but wonder why she wouldn't put her all into this and not just throw any old thing together just to complete it.    I for one feel completed cheated and let down. I find it unbelievable that she stated in one of her interviews that if she had to do it over, she wouldn't change it. OUCH! Did anyone else feel that? Man that hurt! Hopefully in due time I'll bring myself to read another one of her books, but as for now I need time to recover.

1599869470|5.0|This book probably won't make you rich but it will open your mind to a higher way of positive thinking. Let's face it we are surrounded by negativity everywhere we turn. Media, office, school, home, friends and even family. This book will help you sort it out and separate it so it doesn't interfere with you creating your own life/destiny. Also bear in mind this was written a long time again.
B00288KNL8|4.0|Coraline: 7 out of 10: Whom is this movie for is a question that dashed through my mind while watching it. It is too scary and adult for most children. The film is full of High Octane Nightmare Fuel and retired adult entertainment stars with naked elderly puppet breasts... come to think of it that is High Octane Nightmare Fuel as well.    As for the adults in the audience, I fear that in my case the film was too distant. I never felt emotionally attached to our plucky protagonist. In part because she is not a very nice girl (nor terribly plucky now I think about it) and partially because the film seemed to place her and her predicament at a distance.    On the other hand, I was floored by the sheer artistry of the film. Visually this is simply one of the most stunning films I have ever seen. Director Henry Selick who helmed such stop motion masterpieces as James and the Giant Peach and The Nightmare Before Christmas has taken his art to a new level. Words simply cannot describe the visual delights that lie inside Coraline.    While I found the story somewhat distancing I also recognize the depth of the tale. Coralines two universes mirror each other in a complicated web rather than a simply black and white as one might expect. The ocean here may not be that wide but it is amazingly deep. To bad the water was a little cold for this swimmer.
0061719544|5.0|I normally don't read very often or when I do, it normally takes me forever to read it.  However; I saw this book and since I always enjoyed Craig Ferguson on the Drew Carey Show, I figured that I'd buy it.  I couldn't put it down!!  Two days it was finished and 5 friends of mine are lined up to read it.    Throughout the whole book, it's so easy to be drawn in by the lovable loser that you're just hoping pulls his head out of his butt (or as the book says...habookie) long enough to get his act together and completely cheer when he does.    I openly laughed on several occations and teared up a few times too.  I wish everybody in this country was so openly happy to be here!!
