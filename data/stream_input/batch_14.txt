B0008D6NK0|5|I love it works great. Not had any trouble with laser like some have stated. I would recommend this to anyone needing help to park in a tight area.
B00Z7KIZPA|5|I've had the &#34;Car Cache'&#34; for over a year and it's the best accessory I've EVER bought for my car.  My purse is always within reach and it doesn't sit on the dirty floor and slide around or spill everything onto the passenger seat or floor!  The model I have is the tan but is not a &#34;pocket.&#34;<br /><br />I like these so much that I've given as gifts.  I want to purchase more for gifts but don't see the tan available in the Purse Pouch.
B002EVWE8O|5|I have only used the wash/wax so far...<br />It's cleaned my camper with little to no effort<br />Left a nice shine!!<br />Size of each product was surprising considering my RV dealer was a lot higher in price
B007TQ7ZDS|5|Exactly what I needed!
B00REJX5BQ|2|Thought the support of cover was stronger!
B006QH560A|5|Perfect
B0002JMU3E|5|Easy to install. Great performance.
B00L8WSJL6|3|It was the kind of t-shirt that I wanted. Except, of course, the size was too small for me.
B009UP4GMO|5|Brought brakes back to OEM performance.  You can't beat orignal equipment.
B0041RQF0C|5|I'm certain it would great  if I could just figure out where I put it. Lol<br />Been looking for it for a week now.
B008WY65PK|5|LOVE AMERICANA and this will be so perfect for my white car's antenna.
B006OMCU6A|2|It was not the correct replacement for the existing part. It resulted in a waste of time and an unnecessary trip to the repair shop.
B004J0YNYG|5|great price and product
B001O0TZ7E|5|Fits Subaru Legacy 2009
B00EDQ1AV0|5|As described. Exact OEM part.
B003XU6B0C|4|These are high quality gloves, and fit very well.
B0031GUR6C|5|fit fine
B00AX8DEK2|5|Very cute and well made.  Makes me smile when I look at it.
B000GZP9FK|4|Great so far, went on easy.
B000WK8EGA|4|For the price, I like it... It seems a little flimsy to me. I see it vibrating, and I also don't like the fact that the hardware is only black... but that may be due to the price. The height is perfect, and the hardware allows for a large variance of customization on location and angle. I like that aspect a lot!
B00S5OPU6M|5|This light works great, was easy to fit and is very effective
B00T8UY9PA|5|Very bright but had to add another battery. They work very well with the second battery. Considering I have a 52 inch light bar and two 4 inch cub lights.
B000EDSSMA|5|I like it
B003NG0YGI|1|Fell off the very first day, don't know why
B002NRNQ9A|5|Fits just right and looks great on my Ninja ZX 14.
B00LRG5HWW|1|The stems broke off during the installation it was very weak and poorly made do not recommend it to anyone
B003WZX7UA|5|Have not used them yet, but seem like very good quality.
B007TG7HXG|2|Considering replacement after only eleven months.  Previous Bosch wipers held up much longer.<br /><br />Either this bar style is inferior to traditional spring wipers or the quality of rubber has gone down drastically.
B0047DDB70|5|perfect fit, easy install, great ride. End of story.   UPDATE 8/29/16 Not a lot of miles on these but still no problems. No squeaks, great ride, still very happy.
B00H4JCQGQ|5|Very nice covers most of the windshield
B00NM1XL0K|5|Got these for my husbands 2012 Chev 1500, He installed them and loves the look. All the lights worked/fit and as others stated he only had to flip half of them to get the polarity right. Great look with the crisp bright white light. No more of the off white/amber looking stuff
B00192JGDU|5|I like this table very much is very helpful
B00W45JVFE|5|looks nice on my cars Bumper.
B001Y91MFI|5|Generic matching plastic wheel cover at a great price. Only needed one, broke a tab on installation-careful  - my fault - still used.  Very fast delivery.
B000VU57YS|5|very happy with quality of product and shipping was fine and works as advertised
B003BL1H0M|5|Look great
B000C5K5RQ|4|ABOUT AS GOOD AS YOU CAN GET.
B00Y90NMCK|1|I bought this because it was a good price and said it fit and was compatable with my 2003 jeep wrangler. It clearly was not and does not fit.
B004PX1FAC|4|Works great. Had to wipe grease off chains it is shipped with. Had to fix a chain for the trolley on my I beam. Hook wasn't big enough
B000C81FZO|5|working just fine
B0066S6W3Y|2|packaging was very poor. foam rubber &#34;padding&#34; on cart was damaged. foam rubber padding on cart is barely sufficient to protect the car top. I will have to add additional padding to protect my convertible top. However, the cart was easy enough to assemble and it works well enough. Just the padding is poor.
B0076MBL0S|5|Great
B00SAAESH8|5|Excellent
B005SJDMLC|5|I am pretty happy with these lights.  I had thought that they would be under the factory glass but they are not.  They replace the factory glass for the parking lights and fit in the exact same spot.  At first I was a little bummed because I didn't want to take out the factory glass but after the install was complete it looks great.  They are extremely bright and look great against the chrome bezels.  My only complaint would be that you would need to get a quick attach/detach wire harness for them or you will not be taking the bezels off with out completely removing the lights from the bezel.  I did not know that.  Pretty easy install even though there was zero instructions.  Not even for the wires saying which ones were which.  Trial and error will eventually lead you to the correct layout but they really should have that included at a bare min.  The picture I added was taken in the dark so you can see the lights when lit.
B007TM5P0C|5|easy to install and works great
B00Q3WWCJG|4|Good  price  and fare  quality .
B000CCDLEI|4|This works with the VDO sender.  The only unexpected detail is, the scale marks are irregular - they are NOT evenly spaced like the picture on Amazon.  You have to wonder if it's a misprint.<br /><br />I didn't check the pressure with a mechanical gauge but it does warn me when my oil pressure approaches valve-clatter level.
B000NCOKV0|5|Keeps my two motorcycles charged and ready to go at a moments notice.  Both fired right up after being on these all last winter, like they were never parked.  Works awesome!
B00681BE2S|5|Easy to program works perfect
B00915JI08|4|works great..
B00IFWTHEU|5|I was extremely happy with this purchase.  My armrest was torn and it was taking away from my beautiful interior.  Its a perfect fit for my A4! BDiggs
B001RBCU90|5|This is super easy to apply. Shipping was fast!
B00MSSYHEW|1|Easy install. Looks good.....<br /><br />But after an hour of being in the sun... They just fall off...<br /><br />not happy
B00CRT8IRY|2|The black tape that are on the glasses  are peeling and I haven't even had them that long
B009AA2FAY|5|Part did the job. Sensor went off.
B0051MYLS4|5|HANDS DOWN!!! Did I say that yet?? So this thing is great. Foam center with micro fiber liner. Helps it to absorb the soap or wheel cleaner (less waste) and doesn't scratch your rims. No metal at all!! The foam center folds to help reach smaller spot on the rims. I have used other products ranging from Target, Auto Part Store and Amazon. All in all HANDS DOWN best tire brush.
B002R0L4GA|5|When I went to replace the blinker bulb, I found the socket had distorted the portal in the light assembly where the bulb and its socket could not be removed.  So, I looked in Amazon for a replacement, found one, and ordered this light assembly for my 2007 Ford Focus wagon.  I received this part quickly and was able to install everything in less than 10 minutes that includes a new socket for the bulb and a new plug that I spliced onto the old wire harness.  The light assembly once installed looks just like the original.<br /><br />In the future and in need of something similar, I would look to TYC to fill the need because of my experience with their product.
B00KTIUG5C|1|I was able to program these remotes but they don't work more than a couple of feet from the car. I ended up taking them to a locksmith who tested them and said that their signal simply isn't strong enough. I ended up buying another one elsewhere.
B013VAL2KM|5|I'm obligated to disclose that I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed by this product at first - I was hoping I could use these bulbs on my German car (36mm festoon, 42mm festoon, and multi-sided wedge bulbs), but they were the incorrect size and light direction for that application.<br />However, I do happen to have a Subaru which was able to use these bulb and they worked great for that! It brought some extra light into the interior of the car having these new bulbs, and gave a nice new-age bright white look opposed to that nasty yellow light.<br />This product comes only with festoon and wedge LED lights. The wedge lights are unidirectional in the way they project light - so they may fit into wedge sockets on cars other than Japanese, but they light projection may make them less than ideal for the application. The festoon bulbs measure 30.2mm (ish) according to my cheap-o calipers. They did seem slightly bigger than the festoon bulbs out of my Subaru, but worked just fine.<br />From my count, this package came with 8 festoon bulbs, and 10 wedge bulbs.<br />One thing to note, these LED bulbs do have a +/- terminal - if you put them in and they don't work, try flipping them around.<br />All in all, I'm pretty impressed with these bulbs, especially at the price point they are offered at. It would just be nice if they manufacturer would provide some more specifics about them on their product page here.
B000VAXG82|5|Perfect replacement, good fit (wires are about 4 inches longer than OEM, but that's no problem, just a wire tie).  Installed this O2 sensor about 6 months ago, worked perfectly from the start and is still working perfectly.  This sensor cost about half as much as the NAPA dealer was going to charge.  It fits our 05 Pilot perfectly except I had to re-route the wires upward away from the fan and wire tie them to the spark plug coil mounting bolt.  Manually reset the code using my Innova code reader (another Amazon deal!).  Thanks, Amazon.
B000E0UXYE|5|Best price. No magic here other sellers wanted 3 times the price these guys are reasonably priced.
B000CMHTZU|5|Very good quality.  The drawback is with my 35 inch tires on my 2009 F250 King ranch they touch the tires when I turn on either side
B00853A6S0|5|This took the place of a big bulky bed tool box that I took out. I love this under seat storage! It's sleek and easy to install.
B000IG5PZQ|5|We use these clocks at my work for by machines for clocks. These are a great price and hold up very well to dirty conditions.
B009T9Y608|5|Fits and looks perfect for its not plastic but its not carpet perfect for have duty boots.
B0024E6V30|4|This filter does a great job of cleaning up the water. The only issue I have is that it greatly reduces the water pressure. Tried a new one thinking it was clogged but it didn't help much.
B00475I38K|5|Ok
B000WK2AN8|5|Using this on a 2000 VT750 Honda Shadow ACE. Rides comfortable on preload 2/5. I am 185lbs and motorcycle does not carry extra loads. I see no problem if i decide to carry an extra passenger. Installed quick and easily.
B000ARPVO8|1|Poor QC - Lucas must have messed up and forgot the thickening agent. Like others have said, red oil all over the place.  Threw away the tube.
B0010FS0ZG|5|Perfect fit for my 2008 Audi A5!
B004WQJOBY|5|Found these on a Google search for the Mercedes part number for TPMS for my car. Took a chance and installed these in my 2003 SL55 AMG based on the review from Mark Twain saying that they worked on his 2003 SL500. Thank you! Very satisfied. Took at least 5 minutes of driving before they activated but just followed the directions in the owner's manual. Price jumped up $10 each since my order a week ago but still a great deal compared to $190 each from the dealer or $150 each from the local tire shop!
B006LGKIM2|1|I wouldn't buy this even if it's a dollar.  It doesn't work.  It doesn't stay upright and keep falling over.  Waste of money.
B005GQTHNE|1|Item not as described. 2015 Camry has one left and right spring came with two left. Waste of my darn money and time. Not to mention to have them put on and now to take back off the one that fits. Pissed beyond words. Never again will I order!
B00ECTQFIQ|5|I bought two of these to use as a sleek alternative to to big bulky turn signals on my motorcycle (combined with my integrated taillight)and they work  and look great.
B00P5YOCSC|5|a bit bigger than stated
B00LCBH478|5|These struts seem to work geat and the price is good. I was also impressed by how quicly i received the item- great business to buy from. Just a pointer though- i had to remove the retaining clips before the struts could mount. Then i just slipped them back in afterwards. I didnt see that part in the instructions, but i could have missed it.
B008G35SZK|5|For the great price my expectations were not high, so imagine my surprise when I received a quality product.  Installation took me about 1/2 hour with no issues.  When I turned them on they aligned perfectly with the tape marks I had made on my garage door.  I'm very pleased.  Time will tell how long they last but no one can expect plastic to do well in the sun and at this price it is not a problem to change them out every few years if needed.  I do miss the old glass head light lenses. [[ASIN:B008G35SZK Driver and Passenger Headlights Headlamps Replacement for Toyota Pickup Truck 811500C010 811100C010]]
B00MQ5Z5F2|5|Life saver. I've had to jump start my Chrysler 300m with this more than once. Works flawlessly. You can get a couple dozen jumps on one charge. Flashlight is more than you'd think, but less than you'd hope. Not a replacement for a dedicated light, but great in a pinch. As for charging phones, tablets, laptops, etc...it's also great. High enough output to quick charge, and at 18,000 mah, it will keep most devices alive for quite a while. Only complaint is the size. Especially in the case. I wouldn't recommend it unless you want it for its jump starting ability. There are better phone charging packs available.
B003XX21TO|3|The zipper on the rear window broke at the starting point after about 10 times of opening and closing. I got about 4 good months of use out of it.
B00FX479WK|5|First time using any sort of iron/tar remover on my paint...I have to admit I was a little nervous. All I kept thinking was what if this stuff eats through the clear coat! Following the instructions, I gave the bottle a good shake with just about every spray, and sprayed liberally across each panel covering the entire vehicle. Within a few minutes I started seeing streaks of purple running down the paint! This stuff WORKS! Don't let the smell of this stuff scare you away either...it isn't too pleasant, but it gets the job done. I washed it all off and proceeded to go over everything with a fine grade nano skin sponge. I'm pretty certain that the nano skin didn't do much after using this stuff. I will definitely be recommending this product to everyone. All the little blobs of road tar around the wheel wells and running boards sprayed off with ease. This is a great product!
B0019SVYMK|5|Heavy, solid, chrome plate. Lots of compliments.
B00S7NX0RW|4|These fit my 2013 Jeep Patriot Sport perfectly.  I thought they would feel more heavy duty, but they are fine.  Even though some mats were folded, they still laid out flat with no problems.  They will definitely be easy to clean, especially since I have a lot of jobs on the beach (photographer) and always get sand in my car.  I noticed the price went up since I ordered these last week.  Yikes, I guess I got them in time.
B00FO6Y1D2|3|I liked the stickers ( bought one previously) but for some reason these had black ink/dye all throughout the magnets as if they had rubbed together and the ink ran ? I liked the Magna Card sticker better ( one I purchased previously) .  crisp, clean and bright.  no smears of any kind.
B002YKER7G|5|These guys are awesome and the soap is great. I have a busy garage and this hand soap cuts the grease and filth. Easy on your skin too! Ultra fast shipper
B000GU7DNG|4|Minus 1 start because it's pretty expensive (at least I thought so).
B013SAJ1FS|5|Great quality thank you but would like a case for them to be stored in .
B000EQ83I6|5|good price
B00IZN0VQM|5|very easy to install, prompt delivery.  no brainer.
B00XM7JAV8|1|Tried to get these tight where they wouldn't move with foot pressure and the clamp broke in two. Nothing against beer cans except when my hi way pegs are made of them. Don't waste  your money.
B007EF9G7M|3|The good, quality piece, fast shipping and easier return.<br /><br />The bad, Does not fit my truck and SINISTER did NOT respond to my emails!<br />I have a 2003 Ford excursion 6.0 PS, The bolt pattern was not the same, it did not fit.<br /><br />So I had no choice but to return the item and I still have no intake that I want to buy.  :(
B002ISTEA4|5|Love these!
B00HXHRQLO|5|sounds good easy to install.
B010MHV00O|5|Perfect fit
B00MMRH3WM|3|Fast shipping, fast transact. But the paint didn't quite match the color. I expected to be pearl white with silver but the touch up paint is white no fine silver what so ever & the price is a bit pricey for a little bottle. I'm  sorry I'm disappointed with this paint.  : (
B002NGCO30|5|Great
B005VNWFP4|5|Already in use, very good!!!
B000HA9PR2|4|I ordered this, 75-033 Battery Syringe Filler from Plews, to do maintenance on a few of older batteries, for the boat.  I will use it for filling and adding necessary electrolyte as needed, based on the specific gravity.  On is surely bad, but others have responded well and are charged up fully.  Will test now and hopefully they will hold up.  This is the best way to fill in a residential garage.  I put the batteries in a plastic utility pan to aid charging and filling with out spills.  I like the price and utility of this Battery Syringe Filler.  It should last me a long while.
B00BFE5NN4|5|Good quality, factory product but it was the wrong one for my car.
B000CSGT32|5|These last a loooong time! I can go 20k before replacement now!
B00XEH89EK|5|This thing is amazing! I would get this a million times over a GoPro The hardest part about installing this is hiding the wires. The only con that I can see, is that in the Shoei helmets, the speakers area little to big for the factory holes. All you have to do is leave the ear foam in and just use the Velcro.
B000HBNU9K|1|did just as directed and the headliner fell down the next day. Back to square one.
B003ETZAMC|5|Excellent
B00MQ7UCDU|5|Good product, genuine GM storage tub. Fit my 2015 Sierra 2500HD extended cab.
B00U0XPLHY|1|These look great, but the metal threads can potentially damage your Tire Pressure monitoring system.  If the threads seize up, the only way to remove the valve cap will result in a damaged sensor and instantly flat tire.  I learned the hard way, it costs about $80 for a new sensor.  I'm back to the ugly all-plastic caps.
B00PL7TWJ2|5|Excellent product. Very well made and also very useful. I recommend this product to anyone looking for an item like this to buy. This is also a good company that shops very quickly to you...
B007SCPSFU|2|I had bought one of these a few years ago and it was excellent.  Quality has now apparently decrease.  The material is much softer - it no longer is a hardened material.  It bunches up when you put things on it.  Unfortunately, I'd look for another brand now.  Should have returned it, but it's too late now.
B002Y31IGG|5|Very good price, fit was perfect! Thanks
B00A6G5R4W|5|Using one for a boat battery and one for a jet ski. They seem to work great so far.
B00SH33Y00|2|Worked good as runners for a couple weeks. Now flickering. Used them as tail lights and started smoking instantly
B009G5ERVS|5|Very happy with the price and how fast this arrived. Will buy again over the parts store.
B00I0EDRSA|5|Best sticker ever, all top gear fans know exactly what this sticker means
B0006IX87S|5|our water tastes great
B0073JDJEA|1|These were soo cute, I thought they were perfect for my fiat.  I had no idea that they would end up costing me over $100 to have all of my valve stems replaced.  When I went to have my oil changed they informed my that they couldn't get the stems off and saud I would need a tire shop to fix it.  My husband also tried to get one loose when my tire was low and the stem was coming off.  We had to take it to a tire shop and replace all of the stems.  So I would NOT recommend these at all!
B00BMWL2J8|4|Item arrived quickly and works well
B001FY2F6C|5|Fit well.  Came on time.
B006C1CG12|5|Great product works perfect
B00F8JAHVA|5|Better clip and housing than the original and better grade wire and gauge is thicker too.
B0020LFQ5G|5|Worked perfectly
B005CBNWD4|5|Love it.
B000MS830E|5|I have had these in different cars. mainly drag cars. I had one in my show car and bought another red top for my 64 Nova street car. These are great batteries. I always recommend a battery tender when battery is not in use. This goes for any battery
B000C5C48O|5|Great Price
B00C5SOMIQ|5|Can't beat the Monroe brad.and price for a Monroe Quick strut. Easy to install. A little disappointed that WA charges tax for online purchases.
B004GCTFRW|4|It is good and fit my Chevy Impala
B00MC6H0AI|5|Well worth the money!
B005JPGTNI|5|great product
B000WLHGJA|5|Great product!
B001KQ43H4|1|Broke after 4 months- unimpressed...
B000JFHNG0|5|Thanks for the quick delivery, great price and fine product.  The unit is well built.
B0096UB054|5|Good quality and brightness for price.
B006K8GKBO|4|Works well
B004SSAF0K|5|big enough
B007UTN60K|5|Perfect brush for cleaning wheels.
B00QFSAPP6|5|Awesome lights for the price.
B00Y5EL1EG|4|Nice but would be better if they had a way to lock to the adapter instead of the little screw that comes loose
B0019O1BS6|5|Fit perfectly.  Just like the oem filter. Great price and with prime, I got it in 2 days.
B0084X6IB0|5|love the zombies, put it on the car window above the gas tank and the station attendant loves it too, very durable compared to some I have boought
B0006ZFRQG|2|The mechanism for switching between raising and lowering is poorly designed.  There are small diameter pins that hold the springs around the larger pins and they are weak.  The lower one broke on the first use.  The silver portion (maybe some aluminum alloy) of the locking mechanism is partially bent or deformed.  I bought it to remove some stumps, but I am not sure I would be comfortable using it on a vehicle.  Pieces to the mechanism need to be replaced.  The problem is with lowering.  When I could not get the jack to lower, I just tipped it to the side to release the chain (stump removable).  I have seen and used better quality farm jacks, but I was looking for one of the cheapest jacks (~$50) for the stump removal project.  If safety will be a concern, then spend the extra money...
B002GTKAHQ|5|About a 2wk ny delivery.exactly what we ecpected.nothing broken or damaged.highly satisfied with this buy.the mirrors fit perfectly onto our 95 Honda cbr 900rr with no prob
B00EZY337E|5|very bright, easy to install
B0041CC5HY|5|Works Great<br />Might have just got a socket that fits and drill a hole in the side, rather than buy the 70 DOLLAR socket they sell
B00UV07AGG|4|They are great
B00OQNK65G|3|I just ordered wrong ones.
B00EWE3HT6|5|Good fit, good price.
B00JIACMF4|5|The price was the best I found on the net and it works like a champ.  I followed a couple of How To videos on You Tube and had the job done in about 30 minutes.  Now that I've done one, it could be done in fifteen.  The instructions could be a bit more detailed but the product is great.
B00OPU5R86|5|Very good product.
B00CFBV8FI|5|Great kit! Had the project knocked out in 3 hrs. Make sure you buy a tensioner wrench.
B001DRHMRI|4|I've been using these for awhile and they have always had fast shipping and all of the pieces have been included, even a new pan gasket.
B000CF5LCK|5|2003 Toyota Tacoma PreRunner 2.7 Perfect fit! The shop wanted $450 to replace the exhaust.  If you are a man, with tools or you can borrow tools putting this on will be a piece of cake, Nancy boys that play video games all day this will take all weekend, either way save the cash and DIY.<br />Cut the bolts off the old muffler, take off the O2 sensor (you may need to cut the bolts here too), drop the spare, release the hangers, and pull the old bitch out.<br />Send the new muffler in from the back, hang it, that attach to the flange.  You will need an exhaust gasket and I attached the flange with Grade 8 3/8&#34; 1.25&#34; hex bolts, washer, lock washers, nuts.  The O2 sensor connected with 13mm nuts, this is a good time to put a new sensor on.  Also you may need a buddy to help you send and hold the muffler, a real buddy-a guy in levis and boots, not the guy in capris, flip flops and a striped tank top.<br />Do it!
B0000AXQN1|5|replace switch in my 2007 Baja outlaw worked perfect... very well made better than factory
B00VXFKGE6|5|It works better then any other nozzle Ihave ever had.
B003UHH0ZS|5|Turns out for year 2005 and above are not required anymore.
B00RZTD4H0|5|Best seat protection I've found for post-workout! I love the neoprene material and the wetsuit look and feel! It's also cute!! Thanks!
B0042Z0E6E|4|I purchased this to put at my pool since the concrete gets really hot. It works great except my patio chairs snag on it. It is cushy on the feet. Make sure you measure the space you put this in, it is really wide :) It looks like a nice patio rug.
B005HR3VYS|5|Just as described.  Easy install.
B004GOBLCC|5|This grill Looks great on my 2002 Yukon.  This is my first time installing a slip on grill and i've had it on for about 3 months now and shows no sign of coming loose.  You have to remove the grill to install it, but it turned out to be pretty easy. My Yukon looks so much better, its billet aluminum and the grills on this are 8mm, nice and thick.
B004BWU8H8|3|Would not fit with the supplemental side airbags installed in the seat.
B000EQCYXG|5|Shipped fast, good air filter for my 2002 Yukon and low price.
B00J15IEZ8|5|Great
B000IOFVUM|4|GOOD
B007P1JNUK|5|Its work very good for my lexus gx470. Thank you
B000WJWTW6|5|nice high quality
B000JJI8O2|3|Received with a small dent on lid. But the tool box was what I was looking for.
B00PJ7740S|5|Very nice. Delivered quickly. I'm happy with purchase.
B00AZJFWJ0|4|nice
B002JC6YAC|5|These fit perfectly on my 2006 Toyota Tundra 4 wheel drive access cab.  Easy to install and even easier to install if you remove the original wiring harness from the original tail light and install it in the new tail light. Keep the new wiring harness and bulbs as a spare.  If you do that there is no need to go under the vehicle to disconnect the original wiring harness and the three harness fasteners.
B000FIY08U|5|Works perfectly.  Looks exactly like the original that came with our portable cooler - but this one works!  Great for 12v pump for blowing up pools and rubber boats, too.
B001DRNNK8|5|Buy it here or at your MB dealership? here of course :) great price and works as well as the OEMS.
B001EP0G72|5|a very good deal
B0007ZE7XY|4|Ran out of hardener,  had to go to NAPA &amp; get more!
B00WH2XSQC|5|I really like the design!!!!! I was kind of an idiot and didn't look close enough at the description, only at the color, and ordered white thinking it was black. The only thing I can say is that it was a little difficult to put on, only because little details kept sticking to the paper, causing part of the sticker itself to stretch (it's difficult to explain, I apologize if you have no idea what I'm saying). But I really like it, and I recommend it!
B00SGGWGS4|5|I love my Oxford Leopard Print License Plate Frame! I was so excited to immediately mount/install it when it arrived, and luckily, it was so easy to do so - I did it myself within minutes! I chose the Red Leopard to match my red Jeep, and I have already received compliments on it! Eye catching and stylish, but still perfectly designed to go with any vehicle! I was very impressed with the durability and ingenuity of the frame too. For the reasonable price, it far exceeded my expectations. I will definitely be doing business with Oxgord in the future, as shipping was prompt and product is fantastic! A great addition of personality to any car or truck. Disclaimer: I was given a discount on this product to test and asked to give my unbiased, honest review.
B006B3DB4C|5|Worked perfectly
B0009IQZH0|5|I only needed these for polishing my windows after cleaning my car, and these work great on removing any left over residue from glass cleaner. I like my glass to be perfectly clean and shiny, these be good for anything else you need for wiping/polishing/shining on your car. great material and could be useful in the house as well.
B00QRHDIPY|2|This item only deliver .100 amps of current and not the 300mAh as listed and hence my problems.I tried to return it ,but the dates has been closed by the seller.....
B000BUQOCC|4|Very easy way to clean out the black water holding tank. It did leak a bit, but I took care of that by placing it in a trash can so not a big deal to me. In the past I've tried to spray the tank down by just using a garden hose and the squirt attachment but it didn't do much. Since we've had the camper , the tank depth indicator never worked. It says it's empty now. We will see if it registers correctly as it fills up. Haven't been camping since I've cleaned the tank.
B002UIW58U|5|Great stuff, buffing leaves a great clean shine
B000FW61SI|3|you can see through them, but it's a little fuzzy. But for the cheap price it was just OK
B000E5S3BY|5|8% better fuel economy, more power and less engine noise.
B004J7B900|5|Great fit!
B00GZLR7J0|1|Rips easily. Didn't last even a year.  Had to use duct tape patches within just a few months.  Extremely poor quality.  Should not be labeled &#34;heavy duty&#34;. Even though the white fabric on the roof stayed intact, the gray fabric is as thin as copy paper and fell apart/ripped/tore in multiple locations.
B0001EFSTI|5|Such an awesome tool!
B00XK8PPC2|5|These mats are great they are easy to clean, and keep the carpet cleaning as well. A+ A+A+
B00KVOOIMQ|5|Took to locksmith to have cut and synchronized. Works perfectly. Saved $100 I bough this key plus one with the entry and lock buttons. Happy customer!
B00IY3YLCI|4|Lights work pretty good. Construction is fair and it comes with all the hardware you need to mount. Be warned though the description says 2 pair. It's only one pair. You get 2 complete lights to make 1 pair.
B0009H529I|5|Great product I have used them for years with no issues.
B004J38H68|5|Great product
B00559C4AA|5|Great product
B000IZC1C2|5|Melted in the Texas heat.  Mirror fell out of the plastic. Provided great views while it lasted.
B008VPZOHA|5|excellent
B00L9F39R6|5|[[VIDEOID:170a42d1a8ff46d0418a62422d971e13]]This unit works well. It is very robust and that is good news as it will probably stay put on a metal car body. For my purposes I removed the magnetic feet and hard mounted this using the mounting ears. If you plan to mount on a plastic golf cart roof you will probably need to reinforce the mounting area. All the LED elements are working fine.   My ThunderEye was installed on a electric Canam Commander side by side vehicle that is used for Volunteer Sheriffs patrol. The light bar works great and I can recommend this item.   Note: As others have noted the power cable is only 9 feet long and that worked OK for me. Even if you need to purchase a short extension cord this unit is a bargain.
B004A69U9M|5|Perfect
B0002SRCK6|3|This set is okay I wouldn't recommend this product.
B00KTHWGQA|2|4 of the 5 buttons worked on a 2014 Buick Enclave. The remote starter button does not work on either of the 2 remotes I bought. Remotes were programmed by dealer.
B00MAV2EZ6|5|Perfect size for my 4yro
B001KQCC9K|5|This works very well that I order three more for the rest of my windows.
B00ECJ447A|5|It's a PERFECT FIT !!! Thank you fot having it fot a great price too. Will be ordering again !!!!
B0080HJL7S|5|Let's face it! Cars get dirty- especially if you have kiddos! I'm always reminding my kiddos to pick up their trash as we leave the car but more often than not something gets left behind and the next thing I know, I have car full of trash! Luckily, the Rhino Car Gear bag has come in handy and helps keep my car clean!<br /><br />The bag arrived quickly and was packaged well. I love the solid black color with the Rhino logo on the outside. The inside offers a leak proof grey liner. I love knowing that my kiddos can toss almost anything in this bag and don't have to worry about it leaking all over my car. Plus, the liner is super easy to clean when needed!<br /><br />The bag clasps in place around the headrest in your car. We chose to put it around the drivers' seat where my kids can easily reach it when they are in the backseat. It clicks in place and the straps can be adjusted if needed. The top is velcro, so simply pull it apart to toss trash in and velcro it back shut when not in use. It's really simple.<br /><br />The bag is durable and holds quite a bit! We used it on a trip out of town and it held all of the trash from our stop to get food as well as the kids snacks and drinks.<br /><br />I also love that it's versatile. While it's meant to be a garbage bag for your car, I plan to get two more to hold items that I need in my car. One for my pup's items when we are on the go ( poop bags, water bowls, extra harness and leash, etc.) and a second one for tissues, wipes, and other items we constantly need in the car. I plan to hand those off the back of the second row seating.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with  my Rhino Car Gear bag. It's helping me teach my kiddos to clean up after themselves and making it easier on them as well.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received the following item for review purposes only. all opinions remain my own and were not influenced.

B004SJL8C8|4|Good quality at lower price
B00QMTAZ1W|5|Good panel
B004A5706I|5|rusted like 3 days after I put them on. they were 10 dollars and my doors shut tighter now.
B005MR6W0I|5|Sized right and fit perfect for my son. He works his boots hard and these stand up to it. Shipped quick.
B0100FK1X0|2|Frame only.  No mounting hardware.  Disregard the image, the frame's top crossbar is lower than the top of the cab.  Frame came scratched.  Generally, I like the Backrack but it's not without issues if you buy it on Amazon.
B000FFF3GG|5|Great product.
B00FJDL0J8|5|Leaves my faded black plastic trim look like new!
B003SYFPJ6|5|Perfect, Very easy to install
B00L274YLG|5|Added the perfect appeal to my rock warrior after painting the Toyota emblem black to match the reset. The red and white on this are stable enough to stand out. Gives a nice sportier look.
B004QJWM20|4|Looks good and seems sturdy, but had to do a bit of jerry rigging to get it on, one of the nuts inside the steps broke the weld (looks like it was suppose to be attached with 3 welds inside the step but only one looks like it was connected) so when I first tried to put the bolt though the bracket the nut inside the step broke loose, was able to get something to hold it in place so when I hit it when a impact it tighten fast enough it cinched down good.
B0046I3I8I|3|After 2 months of Rving the seams are starting to rip. Pretty cheaply made but works for the time being.
B0007Y4Y74|5|Fits the original light, no problem, THANKS, you saved me from changing the whole light.
B000CCG00K|5|Put on GMC 1500 5.7l sounds perfect. Not too loud but not too quite.
B00O7TXHBO|1|I bought these for my 2006 commander and they don't work
B0031743MU|5|This was super easy to install, and I have had absolutely no issues with it. The difference was very noticeable. I don't shift up as often as I used to because it generally runs at lower RPMs :). I haven't tested the MPGs specifically but I know it has improved in that area as well.  So happy.
B00ATQ0CR6|5|An inexpensive replacement part.  1/3 the cost the dealer charges.  Well made. Should be replaced every 50,000 miles , or 5 years , in my opinion.
B00CUAWJ6G|4|I used some CarPro TRIX before running this nano skin sponge over my paint, and from what I could tell it didn't seem to do too much. Maybe it is too fine, or maybe the trix dissolved all of the tar and iron particles out of my paint well enough to not grab anything while going over the panels. I think I'd recommend starting out with a medium nano skin if you've never clayed or used a tar/iron remover before. Nice product overall.
B00544ZDDQ|3|5 month life
B007XXG768|5|Well, bought this for my brothers car. And they fit perfect and where easy to install. And no leaks, made his car sound a lot better and it equaled out the chip sensor that was having fits. Very pleased. Thank you again. Well worth the price....  Seal
B009AN2AQK|2|Not so good
B004RVDVIG|3|Was what I wanted but a bit bigger then I expected. Smaller would be better.
B000ETAPXY|5|Fair
B00GZKC6EW|4|Just what I needed. Came on time.
B000C53QUY|4|Easy to install, virtually plug and play. Makes the truck track a lot better vs my OEM shocks that were pretty much shot. For the $ they are hard to beat.
B000ED0QES|3|It worked fine
B000HBNTX2|5|Normally I wear nitrile gloves when doing the dirty-greasy garage work...  Some times they tear, or grease gets all over my arm. This stuff does what it claims..  Rinses-off easily and doesn't leave a bunch or greasy streaks on the sink.  Cleans really well, really fast, and has a long shelf-life..I just used the last of a 10 year old bottle.  Plus it's not petroleum-based.  Yeah it smells good.
B0010DV7P8|4|Shipped fast easy to install
B000FPZXEI|5|The product is great. Very heavy, and looks nice. The included screws are too small a diameter for my 88 YJ,  though. I had to get some 12-24 screws from Home Depot. Not a big deal, but kinda inconvenient.
B00UO7K0L8|3|The untold story is that this comes as two bottles of paint. A base coat and mid coat. You are on your own for clear coat.
B0041E21V2|4|Easy to install and works well but rhey tend to rattle some when I am off road
B005K0235K|5|Very happy thank you
B00VPHZDQ8|5|Installed easily and works great
B001GH1LWM|5|Work great lifted the front of my truck back to factory hight
B005JZGIHK|3|Subaru outback 2015 doesn't latch MIDDLE SEAT ONLY. The tongue fits car buckle, but the car's tongue won't engage with the extended buckle due to small ears that prevent using wrong buckle.
B000ARPVNY|5|my engine never ran smoother
B003L9K9HQ|5|Very good chain lubricant.
B00JHEG80G|5|For the price they're excellent. I would recommend this to anyone.
B00WID0OEE|3|Nothing special for what it cost.
B00BJ7Z3EQ|5|Exactly as advertised, high quality , very satisfied!!!
B00S4HHVLW|5|Got a good deal from amazon warehouse and no longer I have to keep my tired in the trunk when towing the jet ski.
B00CLMBE5A|5|works great!
B001DRHMRI|5|Perfect fit for E90 (2006 325i).
B00MJV0ARQ|5|Perfect
B0009N0W60|5|Very happy with purchase
B00EG1MTGW|5|Excellent packaging.  Bolt on prime and started in one pull
B00QU6KDX2|1|These are shown as silver in the photo but when I received them in the mail after waiting almost three weeks I opened the package to find four ELECTRIC BLUE colored caps!!! CRAP!
B00HTOB0NG|5|A1
B0002MAANI|1|I as unable to get strap thru buckle in such a way that it would hold. Strap just pulled back out. It locks going in and slips coming out. The instructions indicate that you can slide the strap under clamp and pull tight, don't hold this way. On the buckle it has a diagram showing putting strap up through bottom of buckle and out though front, This would probably hold, but was unable to get buckle treaded this way.
B0083H5Q06|5|Fit great on my 2004 Chevy Silverado 1500. I'm not a mechanic and it only took me about 30-35 minutes to install it.
B007JMTNZA|5|Great thanks
B000R9VVDO|5|Perfect for rv traveling
B00KTIR1ZU|2|Only one of the two received was able to be programmed to my car, quickly identified as a knockoff by the tech after opening it up to see what the problem was. The other one does work fine though.
B00JGTYKFW|5|I wound up buying three of these shades, one for each of our cars. I was tired of going to Pep Boys and buying the RECOMMEND shade, only to try it out and it doesn't fit my car.
B00FM6URHI|5|Easy instalation.. fit perfect.
B000UHD74E|3|Nozzle was way too short for my 2012 Explorer AND it fell off inside which took some work to get out.... disappointed.
B0039BQGHS|5|Good as gold
B000MD4YKM|5|Works great works as good as 40 dollar one you can buy at John Deere.
B0024NOAFM|5|Arrived faster than advertised and was a perfect fit for my car. Well done!
B009K6ZH6W|5|Perfect for my 2014 Audi S4.
B00J54J1SE|3|This brand didn't match the other competitor which is closer to my real color so I just painted over yours. They have a better spray button on top which is comfortable for the finger over yours.
B0002M9UUW|4|I have had mixed results with Hella bulbs. I recently replaced a pair of bulbs in my girlfriend's car after one of the first pair of replacement (another common high output brand) bulbs died after 15K miles/1 year. I did one side, she did the other with me talking her through it. Within less than a month, one of the bulbs exploded with dark spotting on the bulb. This is classic failure associated with touching the glass. However we were very careful not to touch the glass. So either the bulb picked up some oil or grease from the car during installation or the bulb came dirty.
B00NBNMLRS|5|quality good
B0009JKGJ2|5|I love it
B00HCOPV24|5|love it
B010IPQ3SO|5|Worked well
B004PX6R0K|1|The description is &#34;Replacement Creeper Wheel - Pair&#34; and the package picture shows a pair of casters. The listing says &#34;sold in pairs&#34;. It comes with a single wheel per package so now I have 3 wheels for a 6 wheel creeper. Very deceptive.
B00NWF822S|5|Nice to know you can still get OE for a vehicle bought in 2001 that's still running like new.
B00RM6X9I0|4|Even though I measured, they are a little big and fall down while in use.  Looking for another brand now that fits better.
B00N9NRLKW|2|Inexpensive communicator...good sound..one slight problem...the instructions are an abomination of the English language..I'm trying to pair the 2 units....if someone can explain to me what this means I'd appreciate it..&#34; Two V6 was on the long press the power button for approx 3-5 seconds. The state of alternating red and blue lights flashing, press the either power button of the V6, the red light off, blue light flashing, start into search matching state. After about 5 to 7 seconds, two V6 red light off, blue light flashing, pairing successful&#34; HUH?? Then it goes on to say...&#34; After the success of pairing, short press the Open key, can enter the talking model&#34;...HUH??... WHAT is the Open key??
B0007LL0CO|5|hopkins trailer connector  7blade has a set screw on front of connector,remove set screw and take a screw driver to the rear of the connector,and stick your screw driver thru the hole and lightly tap on the front piece.The entire front piece will fall out.The piece you have in your hand will be a circular end with seven screws.I don,t know if you just start connecting these wires if it will work right.The wire connector has to be prepared first.The seven wires will have to be stripped about 1/2 inch from the front wire.This is where your screwed if the old connector will not come apart,you will have to do some more research to determine what colored wire goes where?The directions that came with the connector are poor.The directions tell you what screws are what,but does not tell what wire goes where.How about that?But you can look up the color coding at hopkins on the internet.part number 48505 at camping world.
B000PKX0K2|5|excellent product.
B007EDGQJU|4|Quality of product was great. The instruction sheet was worthless. Absolutely told you nothing on how to mount it.
B00KY0ND7I|5|works great
B00S3QHF8S|5|Very good
B00RKIE7FO|5|This unit was the perfect addition to our Jayco 1207 pop up camper.  Made a weekend in the mid 90's comfortable at night and gave a spot to cool off during the day.  Install was only a few hours, too my time.  There is a great you tube video on the install of this, it was a great help<br />  Definitely recommend for others.
B00P3FU4EY|5|great item
B00K9Z3R2O|5|Great fit. Love it.
B00KVQS6B8|3|Very strong product however it did cost me alot of money to be stretched to fit my gear shift area.
B004SS6EMI|5|Excellent car cover for garage kept cars like my Sunday driver hotrod.  The cover is light, keeps the dust off and fits well.  And the price is just right.
B000CP8Q9A|5|Like OEM FORD 2003 windstar.
B0002SA21W|3|Should come with snap grommets
B000C39C86|5|Good quality
B00LCBK6CS|5|Works as described!
B000B8JUNY|5|Excellent

B004ME6CJI|5|Nice!
B00GNU37QU|5|Good product, very easy to install wolith the plug n play harness
B00WFHHUKE|5|great for hooking up  LED'S
B00KCQSM9S|4|Only the 2 front seats fit really well, but not the back passengers seats tho
B00F5MCL1E|3|Did not work as expected no matter what number I selected also my house water pressure is 85 psi
B0045N2A6A|1|Cover deteriorated after just a couple of months. Very dissapointed.
B00LEBLI82|5|Perfect find plan to get more!
B000EH2SPO|5|Great
B0137B5HEC|5|Very good
B009IE2O30|5|I use this in my 07 Toyota Tundra for the front and rear differential and in the transfer case. Great price.
B000C2SCFQ|1|only get 1 connector information at time of purchase indicates 3
B0017YHGXC|5|This item has far exceeded my expectations; I use it with the optional Weco cover, and I get temperatures of -7 degrees. I am now in the process of setting up a custom installation for it in my motorhome for use as an additional fridge/freezer, to add more capacity. A very good product.
B000MUOPNG|3|a little bigger than thought
B000XBKNCQ|5|Everything fit perfectly. Before rebuilding I got 8 mph. Afterwards I got 13 mpg to 14 mpg. On my 18 foot pontoon.
B00BSEZIQI|1|Do not work in anything in my RV. Would not buy again
B00A2OBW24|4|Fits fairly well. Like colors. Material could be a little more durable.
B009O0HIHA|5|Perfect fit
B00O92T1NC|4|👍
B00B03MGLM|5|All parts included.<br />I Could not have made this for this price!
B003YJPG26|5|Very well built! Replacing similar ones that have lasted 14 years.
B000BGOCPM|5|Fit perfectly. Had to work a little at getting the tie connected, but would expect that as you don't want it coming off.
B007LICL56|5|I ordered these with a license plate cover and they look so great.  Very sparkly, solid screws.  Highly recommend these!
B0009IQXJ0|5|This is the best I have found for shiny tires. A little goes a long way. I apply it with a wax applicator and paper towel off any excess after a while. It lasts for a couple of weeks of street use. Twice as long as most other brands I've used.
B005GXQ6EK|5|Excellent product!
B000BZG5YE|1|This part didn't fit my 2000 Toyota tacoma. The connector is was the corprete. I found this out after I installed it. Not happy.
B000GU5WO8|5|Installed on 2007 Honda Shadow VT-600CD (VLX Deluxe).  Not the most robust quality of material, but for what it is and what it does, it works great.  Very happy.
B000GKD5NI|5|Excellent
B004SHYZ8E|5|Good
B007PC7DOW|5|Have not used these yet, but they fit perfect, I tried them on the studs to see how they fit. I got these as spare parts.
B000GVA5KS|5|excellent, works well
B00E9HSHH8|5|super product and no problems!
B002M2MMXM|5|This product is very nice and the service too.
B00V7MNCZK|3|MAY NOT FIT ALL APPLICATIONS LISTED.
B00TMCH1QS|5|Looks great on my tool box
B00PU0MRZG|5|You'll have to be creative with this, hooking the ends to the sides isn't straight forward in a JK Jeep.
B00361V162|5|If you are a tool guy, read on.  If you are a &#34;do it yourself and make do guy&#34;, you can probably stop with the next sentence.  Do you need this to replace a heater element for your Suburban water tank, the answer is no.  You can find an socket somewhere.  But, as far as I am concerned, this is a specific tool for a specific job.  It makes taking the element out and installing a breeze.  I am a tool guy and want to have the right tool for the job.  This works great.  It attaches to your 1/2 drive socket set.  It matches the element lug perfectly. It fits the access hole to a tee.  You will have no trouble removing the element with this socket.  Is it worth the money?  In my opinion, yes.
B0065TGOWI|2|Looked great! However, it did have this really annoying whistling noise.
B00XO6BW40|4|good for a cheap tool
B000Z0HVHA|5|Absolutely the &#34;cats meow&#34;
B00Y2DZEOS|1|It took a month to receive because it ships from Thailand. 1 of the rear pieces had warped plastic and wouldn't fit.
B00G6FRNA8|2|I'm very disappointed...<br />four of the LEDs didn't work properly and two LEDs didn't work at all... very disappointed... I wish I could return but i lost two all ready :(
B00FDX6YAE|5|great for installing LED's in older vehicles
B000IEVL10|3|2013 Honda Ridgeline. Same day delivery. Only 3 star because instructions were slightly wrong and plastic hardware given was not good. They easily were ruined by using instructions. If you install do not use plastic bolt as instructed by running deflector in between hood gasket then trying to add bolt through gasket and deflector. Instead add bolt from deflector on inside of gasket, the gasket adds to much thickness and you ruin bolts trying. Other reason for 3 star is I'm not sure how solid this is going to hold on. Last reason for 3 star is they need to give extra bolts, u you only get the exact amount you need and I lost 2 down my engine compartment never to be seen again. Luckily O'reileys is a few miles away
B000HA9PZ4|5|Only complaint is that I would like a spring or a detent to hold the lock in place. I rarely need to adjust the winch tension for my purposes though. It's also quite strong - I was easily bending 1/2&#34; rebar through the winch hole on a project.<br /><br />I ended up drilling two holes in the back plate and mounting it that way, and the install looks clean this way.
B00AMBKD3Q|1|Never worked:(
B00KTKGSI4|5|great price, oem so perfect
B000RNU4BA|5|Perfect fit at first seemed to be off as some posts stated but this is a true exact fit product as it should be. I am very pleased with this product solid construction perfect finish. If you have install issues with fitement stay with it all hardware will line up and start by hand once everything is correct. 5 star product
B004BTBUXC|3|It doesn't fit my 2015 Civic as the picture shows. I guess Honda changed the interior design for the 2015 model, so the pieces no longer fit. The cutout of the piece that goes to the driver's seat did not match well with location of the trunk release. I ended up having to move it a little bit to the right, I guess I can live with it.
B00HW2H6UQ|5|I chopped holes into them so I can use the side skirts and rear diffuser with them!<br /><br />Take that mopar! Saying I can't use them together
B001HLIMD8|5|Very soft and comfortable!
B00OKQYBXC|5|Looks great
B00ANZHG4U|5|Great for cleaning glass with just water. No streaks left behind
B007WR25FC|5|Love this gear. it's like a family suitcase and easy to strap.
B00FSIN0U6|1|I was very happy with this bulb at first (2 months ago). It worked great but now only 3 of the 25 leds are working right when I really need the light the most in the RV. Because there is only a 30 day return policy im stuck with it. WASTE OF MONEY WHEN THINGS DONT WORK. I would gladly exchange but looks like im another sucker that bought this light since there is no option to do so. Looking at the reviews it seems they all work till the amazon return policy lapses. Even if I was to buy one again they upped the price by a dollar in the last 60 days. GOLD STARS GETS ONE STAR FOR THE ONE MONTH IT WORKED.
B00LASK56A|5|Excellent product Love it
B002969BQW|5|This is a good product. It worked great with the paint I ordered.
B005OYOMTW|4|Love Ventvisor. One disappointment--The Ventvisor on this model leaves the rear of the rear windows open for rain when the window is opened any amount.
B00Y2ZT4S8|1|It doesn't fit!!!
B00IU34ZIW|5|Super fast shipping excellent product
B00MN9DNNW|5|Nice bright lights
B000GTU5E6|5|Fits my 2000 Honda Shadow 750 ACE. Plastic spacer can be shortened to adjust preload if a softer ride is required. I set my spacer length according the the included chart and the bike rides well, maybe slightly on the stiff side. Front end drive under hard braking is well controlled.
B00OO1R2AC|1|Does NOT fit 1987 4Runner. Main mounting holes are too close together. Unfortunately, Amazon gave me the green fits your vehicle.
B00GWTAAIA|5|Works fine. You just push it straight onto the Schrader and it shows your pressure. Each tick mark is a # of pressure, which makes it easy to read. The gauge holds your measurement until you tap the bleed button. Other gauges read to a higher pressure - one my car tires and bike tires will never reach - and are difficult to read, so I like this one.. Also, you can bleed off pressure using the button above the gauge to set it just where you want it. Just a normal gauge though - not liquid filled or anything and the needle bounces around when you bleed it.
B000EDST1K|5|Perfect. Just as advertised.
B00PL0LU9Y|5|Very impressive, I feel it light more than the OEM of Toyota Avalon 2013+<br />I have given my brother my OEM bulbs and used it 8000K about 2 years, 8K nice color but poor lighting to compare with 4300K. Now back to 4300K with this bulbs &#34; XC PHILIPS OEM 4300K D4S&#34; Actually I liked it a lot.<br /><br />For those who love loves the color white or white clear these bulbs 4300K not for you. I would recommend this&#34; XC PHILIPS OEM 4300K D4S Xenon &#34; for those who love the OEM 4300K color and Power Lighting in road<br /><br />I take many pictures its seems blue but in real life yellowish.
B001F0G7SI|5|Worked great little off from factory but works great and a great seller
B003VZLJFG|1|I got a great workout from it but the results wasn't that great. I even gave it a second round but still not much difference. I just wanted to give this a try before replacing the entire unit. See my photos.
B008YAVIOK|5|good protection
B003RF6TO6|5|I ordered 06 yamaha 700 raptor universal fan yesterday it came the very next. Talk about super fast shipping. Very pleased with the fan very good quality made in Italy wish is was better then China. Definitely going to order from theses guys again.
B005NLQAHS|5|I have bought several of these and keep them in the glove box of all my cars.  This has been especially useful in the situation where my kids were away at college (many miles from home) and their car was acting up.  I had them plug it in and get the codes using Torque and then we could trouble shoot remotely and or determine if they could drive the car home or if they need to get it to a shop in their town.<br /><br />I also use one of these in conjunction with the Torque Recorder app which can impose the gauges I choose into the video.  I mount the cell phone to the windshield and off I go.  This has allowed me to answer one of the more common questions I get about any particular autocross track I have run which is how fast do you go.  Whereas before I had a general idea, now I know exactly and where I was able to go any given speed.  This also allows me to analyze other performance characteristics of my car while I was on course.
B00PZ07U58|5|This was so simple, it's made to fit, I did have someone help 2 people 20minutes done,work's great.good price
B00KTIY7U2|5|Works perfect
B00IG1C3IC|5|Love this decal, got one for myself and one for a friend, put mine right under my registration ;D<br />They even tossed in an extra decal that I wasn't expecting so that was cool, two thumbs up.
B001OMVCN2|5|I LOVE LOVE LOVE having this in my truck.  I am a road warrior and typically connect and disconnect at least once a day.  This allows me to dial in the pressure for load then unloaded at the touch of a button.  I blew a bellow from not having the minimum psi and this has solved that problem as well.  No more not having enough air, or too much air, finding air.  No passing tubes through a fire wall to install, though the install still takes a fair bit of time.<br /><br />Worth a note.  Instructions say not to install under the hood and out of direct wet areas.  That was actually a tough to place to find.<br /><br />I have used for a full season and it has worked flawlessly.
B00KQHVBOQ|1|cheap quality, not  as advertise,
B005TOLSBC|2|Timely shipping. Looks as pictured. Was too small to fit the chip in my key fob for my 2005 Pontiac G6. Maybe I could have filed it down but I was afraid I'd break the chip. Couldn't use it.
B00537FBIG|5|GREAT HITCH  EASY INSTALL  GREAT PRICE
B001GC0L8C|2|One of them arrived with a dent in it. The black coating on the inside also peels off in under a year.
B003FUY4BI|5|I used this formula 20 years racing dirt track, its not a softener, but a conditioner, I use now to get extra life out of Motorhome, and Trailer Tires.  I apply 2 times a year, its like hand creme for your tires.
B0082365AQ|4|Very lightweight and the wheels come off in a second which is great because you'll probably have to replace the tubes after a couple of uses like I did. No thorns or foreign objects, just really cheap tubes that spit at seems or leaked around valve stem at normal prescribed pressure.
B0010DXYHC|5|Fit my 2002 VW Passat GLS pefectly.
B001CEG90I|5|Nice product
B00ZGGORFM|5|Fast shipment appreciate I received as described. Used it on my 2005 softail for just the motion alarm. Very loud alarm. Excellent, thanks.
B000C9QA08|1|Total waste of money. Clutch has 23 splines when it should have had 10 splines. Release bearing is too small for transmission shaft.
B00332GB6Y|5|Very nice Hood Scoops. Worth the Price
B0002SA4GU|5|Arrived quickly and fit great. My Sami is sexy now
B0041CDPQO|5|Great price for a great item. Works fine and is of very good quality. Picture looks like item, accurately described.
B000HBM37A|5|I used this to seal a car trunk that had water running the door  gasket and into the ribs that hold the gasket to the metal.  That resulted in the water coming out at the lowest point into the trunk.  It is runny so make sure you tape off or cover things it could drip on... it also required me to be fast and operate in sections.... NO LEAKS now though.<br /><br />It dries a hard dense rubber so you won't be pulling it off and putting it on.... it is not a flexible gasket feel.<br /><br />I had some left over... so...<br />1) I did glue a sole back onto some sneakers... put it in the clamp over night to dry and it has been great for weeks.<br />2) It says it is electrical compliant.. I had a car USB charger I bought on Amazon that fell apart in our hands before we ever used it.  The plastic clips that held it to the metal plate broke... I used this rubber to glue the two together... knowing it should not create short.  It worked Great glueing the plastic to the metal.<br /><br />Shelf life... you can see in my photo that I had some dry chunks after about 3 weeks of post use sitting.<br />It skims over quickly so you want to get your bond before that happens.
B003IS3HV0|5|I really like this product.  It's a conditioner, not a cleaner, and this seems to throw some people.<br /><br />It was used on a new leather laptop bag first.  As recommended in the &#34;most helpful review&#34; of this product, a drop of water did not bead up so the leather isn't coated.  No cleaning was required, it's new with no signs of dirt or stains.  The conditioner was absorbed readily and evenly with only a slight darkening of the leather.<br /><br />On a pair of new Blundstone work boots, the conditioner soaked in readily and evenly.  There was no apparent darkening with use but the color was already quite dark to begin with.  After a couple of hours, and before buffing, the boots were dry to the touch and the finish was not shiny or sticky.<br /><br />From reading a number of the reviews, there seems to be several recurring issues.  Follow the instructions and be aware of the following points:<br /><br />This is a conditioner, not a cleaner.<br />If your leather has a coating on it, you may not like the result of using this product.<br />Test on an inconspicuous spot first.<br />After applying, let it soak in overnight.<br /><br />Your experience may differ, but this worked well for me.
B0104GEEDI|3|It fits good and does what we need to do.
B00T74X2GY|1|Nope ,it doesn't work .
B00ANWV6C6|1|CRAP!!! They don't have clips, so they don't stay on!
B00CGFPW64|5|I work in a body shop and I use it everyday. Thank you!
B00062Y9OU|5|I've been using it for months and it works great. I recommend it.
B004FH29PI|3|Works well reflecting the sun, but the design for how you store it is worse than other solar shades I have purchased in the past.
B00192JGY4|5|Fast delivery, great quality and work so very well, use it on my portable fire pit tank and trailer tank, so nice to see where you are at for fuel. Highly recommended.
B00EA0ZB7I|4|2009 Kawasaki Concours 14- Mounted under side view mirrors on my motorcycle. They look very good. Bright, not directional though, more of a flood. They work fantastic in conjunction with high beams. I turn them off at night when oncoming traffic approaches, except on the freeway or on Fridays. I run them at all times during daylight. I added clear silicone to all potentional leak spots. No moisture or condensation inside unit. I do ride in the rain and park it in the rain.  DO NOT USE THIS HARNESS: [[ASIN:B00O72R7Z8 Mictuning LED Light Bar Wiring Harness 40Amp Relay ON-OFF Waterproof Switch(2 Lead 12ft)]]  It smoldered under my gas tank and nearly caught fire at the relay and connection terminals at LED light wires.  Use this one instead: [[ASIN:B00QFSAPP6 OPT7® Off Road LED LIGHT Bar On-Off Power Switch 40 Amp Relay Wiring Harness (Dual Light Bar Harness)]]  This harness and these LED's work great. See attached pics
B00192QB3I|4|a+
B00BG922Z0|1|I bought these to replace a failed set of Recon LEDs I bought.  14 months in on Recon's 12 month warranty and half of each light went bad.  Recon was more than happy to sell me another pair at twice the price of these but wouldn't warranty them so I took a shot with these.  Just as with the Recon's the &#34;tab&#34; that snaps into place is paper thin.  If you put any pressure on it whatsoever it will snap off and no longer seat properly.  Be very very careful as you install these and remove more fasteners than you think you need to as any stress at all on the tab will render the light useless.
B0037YKLB4|4|Just what I needed
B000HS4QA0|5|Very nice. Put these on my 1990 FLHTC to replace the stockers which were falling apart. I picked these because of the removable end-piece which allows access to the air valve on the left hand side. They look sharp and feel great.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Keeps the inside of our vehicle from heating up with the LA heat wave.
B004OI82NG|5|What can I say it is an OEM coil pack, great price fast shipping
B0044UQAKQ|5|Timely delivery and a great 'classic' product.
B009F10S3Y|5|Looks fantastic on my car!! It puts an inch on bumper so It doesn't scrape. Shipping was on point!
B00K6BR99I|5|This fit my small winch perfectly
B00G49DVGG|5|My car is regularly parked under a tree and after a solid month of rain, the odor inside became too much to bear. I tried other products and they just masked the underlying scent. I saw this in my local auto parts store and decided to give it a shot. The scent was too strong for me initially but it quickly subsided. The major point is that it eliminated the musky odor that I had no success in eliminating with other methods. I would agree with the other reviews, completely clean the inside of your car including vacuum. From there just follow instructions.
B00K325MC6|5|Perfect. Used to fix car AC then recharge r22 house AC.
B000E0P6UK|5|Just what I needed
B00RM327NG|5|Strong magnet and holds well to the vent.

B00BTHNEDI|5|Woke great good light
B005NLQAHS|1|As others have noted, on my 2015 ram 1500 it puts on a light show of flickering dash lights that never end when I turn the key off, though it does connect and work when the truck is running I'm afraid to use it as I don't know what control anomalies it may present
B002GO93I8|5|Worked well ,easily installed
B003TKNUBE|5|DC sports in mazda 3 HB 2007
B00EAOIHR0|5|Exactly as expected.  Fit into my Explorer with ease.
B000VVSPX2|2|Great quality, much softer protective material inside than I've seen on other covers I've used from other manufacturers. It packs down real small too so is nice for traveling.<br /><br />Update: Took a 10 day road trip in mid-October from NY down to TN. This did ZERO against keeping the dew off of the bike overnight. In fact, the dew was enough to saturate the cover and totally soak everything underneath. It would have been better to not even put the cover on. I guess this is fine to keep the dust off, but that's about it. &#34;Water-resistant&#34; as it was described, is totally and completely inaccurate. I wish I kept the box, because this would be on it's way back to Amazon.
B00OT602BI|5|Better than expected
B000CKGAV6|5|Works well so far, easy installation and bright lighting
B000WNM5K8|5|Excelent
B00F0QAPBI|4|Gives the car a different look I'm satisfied with this purchase only thing i dislike is the emblem that comes on the shade. It says &#34;avs&#34; in silver I'm going to try and take it off lol. Only reason i put 4 stars or it would be 5. Really well packaged as well.
B00GZHBBZK|1|Didn't fit Q5 and didn't come with all hardware
B001AGPEDQ|4|As described,  factory fit
B00GZLMEN4|5|item arrived promptly and as represented.
B00HV5RBT0|5|Very sastified
B00JA3BMDW|5|much much better than I expected for the price. One great buy!!!!
B0097MWSVQ|4|Good job cheap good
B00R8LASUG|5|Good
B00K8DD8C6|5|Easy to install and saves from cranking
B00PKFANFC|5|It fits with e-golf and even matches the color (blue)!
B0001EFSTI|4|Very helpful multi tool, and well made. Only thing is opening bottles requires some extra care as the serrated blade must be exposed to use the bottle opener. I could see someone who's had a few too many cutting their finger trying to continue the party.
B005ST8EFG|3|Not bad for the money but lacks the smooth rounded edges of the BMW stock mats.  Also, doesn't have the velcro attachment pad like the oem.
B00JNHYZ4I|5|Exact Color, Shipped safely. Much cheaper than going and having the dealer get one and put it on. Did not do the drilling, rather put it on with the tape. Has been on several weeks, hot weather and car washes and all. No issues or problems. Happy happy!
B00E1J13AW|5|I really like these. They match so perfectly that you don't even notice that they are there. Very pleased.
B00CGGXQV6|5|Second truck I have owned that I installed this type of cover.  I love it.  Would buy a third time if I switch trucks again.
B0074DFE5W|5|Perfect fit.
B001KO7S2S|5|xvuChu FWD checvguvuc
B010SH8OFW|4|I liked it but this was way shorter then expected. I thought it would cover the entire hand rest of my Chrysler 200. It's okay if you just looking for something to keep it from getting dirty.
B00IUSISU8|5|Great quality. Very easy to install. Just make sure the rubber tab from the old light shud be removed very carefully. The stick part comes apart and then u gotta use doublesided tape.
B00KSZ5F5C|5|Great product! Looks awesome in the hood of my car
B0026Y3YGK|3|Can't use in conjunction with Truxedo tonneau cover.
B005P0BQ7G|5|good
B00WNGV0WG|5|My 4 year old son and I love this tray!  It is firm enough to be a table, but soft enough with the car sit so it all fits nicely together.  I read the positive reviews and my review is a glowing positive as well.  Thank you for a great product.
B00I796582|5|Great product, perfect price.
B000QBA51M|4|I installed these on two previous cars with not a single issue or problem in ten years, even driving through automatic washes with rotating brushes? I just installed these on a 2011 CR-V and had a problem getting the windows up without binding. I had to put a drop of super glue in two places, one at the bottom rear of a rear one and bottom front of a front one. Also, I recommend that you use something like cotton balls to clean the channels instead of the flimsy little wipes that come with it. I used about five cotton balls with alcohol on each window track. Once installed, they fit well but not perfectly. Hoping I can get through next weeks car wash without problems.
B009EJRBZ0|1|I seldom leave a review but this was such a let down. This item is a piece of junk. I was able to blow my pool inner tube up way faster by mouth then with this. I would never recommend this to anyone it went strait to the trash.
B000TDT8KG|1|I let the glue dry for 2 days.  I put the mirror on, drove about 3 miles and it fell off the windshield.
B000CIV4QY|5|I used it as a return fuel line (Welded to filled hose)......Fast Shipping.
B006ONRS9I|5|Easy installation.  Bumper feels solid
B00A19QVHQ|5|Awesome!!
B00HYI8NF0|5|Has worked beautifully on our camper's faucet.  Didn't have to buy a new costly faucet - only this small, inexpensive piece.
B007JWPVO2|5|Installed easily - works well.
B00M0443ZW|5|The brightest LED bulbs I have ever put in my vehicles by far. I used these as reverse lights and what a difference; its like having spot lights back there at night when you're in reverse! YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!!
B00FJUZY8Y|5|A handy cart for household use. A plus that the all four casters swivel.
B00J4PJOQ8|5|Good quality!! Rotors... thanks..
B006WPQNB2|5|Excellent product,  works as intended, fun to use, best used alone.
B00KHRCE1E|5|I put this on a HD batwing fairing. I thought I had soaped it up well enough not to risk misalignment as well as get the air bubbles out.<br /><br />I was very fortunate it found it's mark the first time and without air bubbles. I couldn't lift it off.<br /><br />Great decal and looks great!
B00LHUI4XM|5|This license plate frame was exactly as I had expected.
B002EWWJ2Y|5|Weatherguard 1918 round base arrived in great shape tks Greg whiting
B004VG0N38|4|Meg's always meets or exceeds expectations - great MF pads (thus far)!  I use them with a Porter Cable DA polisher and HD Speed for surface corrections and general polishing.  That is a winning combination.
B004HWSWIE|2|Nice flag but it's not orange. Can't use it on the dunes
B000CPAW2O|4|Works fine, just what I was looking for.
B0068EUZJ8|5|As advertised
B00N9XVPAE|5|Really impress with this produce!! Got it to use in my bassboat but ended using it for my vehicle first to jump start it. Did it's job in cranking it. Really like it's size for storage in my bassboat and vehicle!!!
B00COYNZHK|5|love them, they have a  safety lock so they not slide
B007QXQKNA|5|Excellent service, lights work perfectly and look amazing.
B001GS1PMM|5|I was skeptical about buying one for my 2015 Street Glide, but the stock windshield just plain sucked.  Way too much buffeting for me.  I bought a Klock Werks Flair, tint, 6 1/2 inch and it solved my problems.  I get less wind now than I did with the Ultra that I had before the Street Glide.  I'm 6 foot and weight 275 with a 30 inch inseam and wasn't sure what size to buy, but the 6 1/2 did the trick for me.  With the fairing vent closed, I still get some buffeting so if you don't have a vent in the fairing, you may want to try the 8 1/2.  But I keep mine open anyway and am very happy with the results.
B002ZBWKAU|5|Just what the Dr. Ordered!
B000NM104K|5|Love the outdoor shower!
B000C1IH70|5|all ok
B0073W8FA0|4|Great product, loks sharp..but took 2 weeks to arrive.
B001VXXUWK|5|Some people commented that the lens was hard to see through? Remove the protection from both sides before you complain. The face shield looks lie it will do the trick.
B007POF798|2|I bought a set of these several years ago for $1.00 and they lasted for several years. Finally were needing to be replaced so I purchased these. These are extremely poor quality, two pockets ripped just loading it with CDs. I'd suggest looking for another brand, this one will not last long.<br />Also, mine came white and gray, color wasn't super important to me though.
B001COAS78|5|same as OEM at way less $
B00PBGDHNU|5|so far so good
B000GV789O|5|Product showed up sooner than expected, well packaged good installation instructions and overall product exceeded expectations!
B002R0P00G|5|Excellent quality and very good price.
B001PH0WUU|1|Waste of my money.
B003SZ80BK|3|This is a generic version of the door panel, NOT exactly OEM. Having said that, it was sufficient for what I needed. There's a lack of instructions for installation, so I watched some youtube videos that helped me out. It works in a pinch.
B000OO4PVM|5|Worked great!
B012A4VLJ2|5|I didn't think I would like to talk on my phone while I am driving, hands free or not. But after getting this device, I am starting to like having my phone available to me in the car. I have a Note 3 and the setup went without a hitch. I did some testing before I needed to use it for real and I was able to talk and the other party was able to hear me very well. They could tell I was in a car, but was able to understand me perfectly. It connects to my phone every time and I have not had any issues with it so far. I am glad I do have two vehicles thou. I initially hooked this up in my truck and there was a very bad hum when talking, but in my other car it is clear. So, if anyone experiences any hum, it might be the vehicle and not the devices issue. I highly recommend this hands-free Bluetooth device.  I got this at a discount in exchange for an honest review.
B002E5FOR8|5|Wonderful! Easy to install, fit perfectly, and works very well! No complaints!
B00G2BINUK|5|It fits beautifully. We are very happy since we live in the Sunshine State.
B00XM7JBTO|1|The clamps provided with these Chinese knock offs are garbage.  Save your time and money.
B00A82A3RK|5|Works as expected.
B0052UBO62|5|Woks very well. No problem programming it.
B003NI15E6|5|Great transaction and product!!!
B001GKQZQG|5|Did what it's designed to do. Worked perfectly for my situation. Not badly priced either, will have to wait & see about longevity of this unit.
B003ZOF09Y|5|It is a little on the pricey side but does a great job either pulling the air in or pushing it out. Very quiet on the lower speeds. This is our second one we have purchased to go in our 5th wheel. Love that it has a remote control with a temp monitor on it.
B003BHR0RK|1|Same Part ## Different Caps,does Not work/Lock on my truck
B00G93E0CG|5|The first I ordered was shipped without any attaching hardware. I couldn't find any way to just get the hardware other than return the hitch and order a peplacement. Other than that, it's a lot stronger than the original.
B00029WYDU|4|Best of it's kind on the market
B00YWC1WWM|1|This product is garbage! It's a poorly executed Chinese nock off. Save the hassle, buy the kuryakyn brand or actual harley.
B003EOVM60|5|Review this but review never loaded...
B003BZD03K|5|Great for tight spots.  Good quality.
B0044B0Y9S|5|Excellent
B003O0YM0W|5|Work great!!!
B00ZJF7GTY|1|Bought these for my 2011 Chevy Silverado.    loved them, however after only 3 months, they all went out within maybe a day of each other. they look great in the beginning, then they perform like s***.    DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE LIGHTS!
B000FPY6V4|1|Listed under power steering boxes, but this is for manual steering. Fit robot says works for power steering...
B0066TA2Y8|1|Bolt head is too tall, and hits the fuel pump eccentric.
B000RI0BGI|3|The mats are well-constructed although the holes do not match on the driver's side. I would recommend these to protect your Honda Accord floor.
B00GT6TZQE|1|I needed an EGR Cooler for my 2006 Ford F350, so I figured what better way to research the best than with Amazon reviews.  Well, before you purchase, do your research.  FoOr this EGR cooler's reviews, check out J. Durham's reviews.  Yes, he has two for the same item.  If you go into his other reviews, you will find all sorts of 5 star reviews for other items.  Then checkout Hollywood Bob's other reviews, again, he loves giving out the 5 star reviews.  Of course, throw in a review with less than 5 stars once in a while to keep Amazon from finding out it may be a reviewer benefiting financially,  Move on to Chuck's reviews.  All 5 stars and gosh, he really likes those supplements, not that supplements have ever been associated with scams.  And last but not least, Card A Hanson claims this EGR is perfect for his CAR.  Yes, Houston, we have a problem.  Take away all the suspected 5 star reviews, and what you have here is an item that appears sketchy at best.  I am leary to purchase an item from a distributor such as JGC Parts which may be arranging to beat the system in an dishonest way.  That said, perhaps both Hollywood Bob and Chuck are big time into supplements as well as EGR coolers.  They are kind hearted souls which see the best in everything, thus 5 star reviews for everyone.  I have tried to address the concerns for valid reviews with Amazon with limited success.  The only way I can even get this review to post is to have it appear as just that, a review for the New EGR Cooler for the Ford 6.0L trucks.
B0041U3KH0|1|The internal wiring was improperly manufactured, which caused delays at installation. Luckily I had the tools and know-how to fix the issue and avoid returning and reordering. Once installed, it has a slightly different appearance than factory units when the light is on, because the texture in the transparent red plastic is different, resulting in slight deviation of brightness and diffusion pattern from original Jeep tail lights.
B000CFME2A|1|No, spark plug in package!
B00BGYL8MS|5|Love it, super smooth screwing on, feels soft and comfortable, and the leather is well stiched. Fits my 86 toyota pickup perfectly. I think the imprint of the grears on top is just right for the look of the thing. Came within two days! Smelled slightly like an automotive shop when I put my nose up to it but doesn't reek like some reviews said. So worth the money!
B00GSAUHB8|3|Doesnt fit on a jetta. It's too big and the sides flop down too much. And because the 2 sides are vonnected there's no way to change the size really. Does block the sun though and i think it would work well on a bigger windshield than a jetta.
B000BUU5YU|5|Just what I needed. Power cord on RV wasn't quite long enough.
B009SR01EQ|3|Diaphragm went bad almost immediately, was able to find replacement diaphragms in China. Works great now.
B011KHEHWS|5|I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />So I know this will sound lame, but I don't wash my car. I just go through the car wash and have the machine do it. BUT, for the sake of leaving a review, I went through the wash today and chose to not use the blow dryer (haha- a blow dryer for a car!). I got out at the end, and used this towel.<br /><br />I drive a Chevy traverse and this towel dried my entire car. And it could have done more. Holy crap. Like, I didn't have to wring it out or anything. It dried the entire thing. I think I kind of like it. I'll probably get another one so my husband can keep one in his car. I'm also thinking it will be nice to have in the house since my kids are always spilling stuff or playing in the bathroom. It's like a one man team on spills or wet spots. I'd recommend this to anyone who loves their car or hates spills!!!!!
B003CK0K82|5|good bearings very good price arrived on time
B000E4JT5Y|5|High quality stuff
B000CNAUG4|5|If you have aftermarket aluminum heads or 351 heads on your 289/302. You will need head bolt spacers because the holes in the heads are 1/2&#34; and the head bolts are 7/16&#34;.
B000C2GFOG|5|Fast shipping and great price. It's the same as the OEM part so it fit and works very  well.
B000IDYKQO|4|My husband ordered one of these for both of us. Thankfully I haven't needed to use it and I really couldn't care less about having one, but it does fit quite conveniently on my keychain and it's kind of nice to know it's there. I have not had any problems with the blade, and as an attorney I take my keys into courthouses almost every day.
B001V8U12M|5|A must with a cordless drill. Makes camping set up super quick
B000CCDMB0|1|As a check tool it works fine. I used it on a ford 5.0 v8. As an piston stop it bent and much cursing ensued.
B00AKHRU7Y|5|Good quality for the best price. Frame off made this simpler than if groin underneath...<br />Very happy.
B001W9OP86|5|I usually don't write reviews for products that I purchase, but after buying and installing these seat covers I felt that I had to. I have used many different seat covers purchased from various auto parts stores in my 2011 Toyota Sienna but these seat covers fit and looked the best in the van. Unlike many other seat covers, these have a buckle mechanism that runs from underneath the seat to the front bottom portion of the seat cover. Once that buckle and strap is connected it prevents the seat covers from slipping off when someone sits/gets off of the seat. The seat covers are made of a material that doesn't attract a lot of dust. Many of the negative reviews are from people who either didn't watch the included installation video that came with the seat covers, or either the install did not come out how they wanted it to look. With the proper time and effort put into an install, these seat covers could look like the car came with them installed from the factory. I would honestly purchase again if needed and recommend these seat covers to anyone.
B004YJW95M|5|Great product
B00IRBPCF2|1|Size and weight ok, but I rounded off the 4mm the very first turn. It's just junk to me now.
B000CMHVJO|5|Get two of your friends to put it in makes it way easier. And read the directions twice.
B00AO4Y0L2|5|good price and product.
B007J5H1CO|2|Only gave two stars for prompt delivery, the product arrived and the wafers are dried up. They have a moldy smell not leather, very disappointed.
B00681BE2S|5|yes it work good
B011FW5QVO|5|I can't even think of a reason why these werent factory I love then they work perfectly shipping was turbo I will order again!!!
B004K2FLP8|5|5 years later and still work. Just as good as a fluke meter. Only which the test leads were longer. Toyota master tech
B008EMGBH2|1|I used to be a K&N fan, every vehicle i purchased I put K&N cold air intake on it first thing. Well this one is either a copy of K&N or they have really become flimsy and have no quality control. The directions are simple, I was 90%finished in 20min (I'm not a rookie), but the first obstacle the air filter sensor grommet  (the hole was oversized, with grommet in place the sensor popped into the grommet it fell out on its own, i did not check the size of K&N hole I inspected my grommet found nothing wrong with my reusable part) also thought I could just find a grommet that fit no big deal. But 2nd, (the lid would not align with any holes to install, every hole was half off in the opposite direction of the last. No way was this thing going on, and if it did no way was I going to put up with this everytime during cleaning. I measured lid holes and found them to be 1/8&#34; off for every hole. I also found that one of the tack welded nuts was missing so mounting lid stopped there) I hope that this is found to be a cheap Chinese copy, I ordered air raid (my first order ever) may be there greatest customer as I go thru trucks. Will post a review on what K&N says, I put note in the box in case quality control is fresh outta college.  I'm a mechanic that could have installed this in 20min or less. But I won't install flimsy defective items in my truck. The filter looked to be true K&N. Other reviews got luckier than me.
B00BEN38BA|5|Installed on my 1999 4 door, 4wd GMC Jimmy. Made of one piece of solid steel about 3/16&#34; thick, extremely solid. This will no doubt last the life of the truck. Search for the &#34;how to&#34; sticky on s10forum dot com if you need help installing.<br />Lift was about 1.5-2&#34; I didn't take exact measurements. Front was leveled by tightening up the torsion bar bolts, don't bother buying torsion bar keys. I think I was riding on the bump stops before because the truck rides much nicer since I've lifted it. Most importantly it looks great and should fit 31&#34; tires now!
B0070NFGMC|5|had this for over a year, it still works and I have been putting it through pure hell, no issues.
B0009H51U8|4|Easy to install. Fits perfectly.
B0009IQZTI|4|Perfect fit. Arrived on time.
B00BT9FVTQ|4|Nice little switch.
B0085FP1D8|5|Fits and looks great!
B00ZZ4IMYC|1|Ordered this decal the first time, received it and noticed a lot of detail was missing from the design from its picture. The legs were not there, the crown was missing pieces, as well as many finer details. I wrote to the seller, they replaced it with a new decal, it's just as bad if not worse. POOR QUALITY AND SERVICE! save your 5 bucks and find a better product.
B00JRE6APE|4|Great product but only issue I have is the key and lock don't exactly lock and unlock smoothly. I have to play with it a bit to use it.
B003VAT8KE|5|Works great. Price reasonable.
B0042HF5GG|4|It was bent to fit in the packaging. Almost cracked the plastic was so stressed. I just duct taped it. Works fine. I give the packager a thumbs down
B00B7QLESS|4|Works fine, with no dangerous and unmanageable &#34;safety&#34; features.
B0009IK4FO|5|perfect fit for hatch window on 2006 Malibu Maxx
B00BD4OL20|5|Great product
B001DRJMVW|5|yep. loving a filter is a good thing..Works fine with the c230 2003 MB
B00032KC3K|5|AAA+++ just as ordered!
B0042VVKGG|4|All 4 work without issue.  Great size and is small enough to easily mount out of the way.  Not sure but I think it is supposed to be able to mount to my visor but cant see how.  -1 for that.  Simple enough fix w zip tie.
B00180FSLM|5|2004 Chevy Avalanche
B008XNZZ7O|3|It's OK at eliminating odors but the scent is not really something I liked for my vehicle; it smells so artificial.<br /><br />I would recommend to eliminate odors only.
B002935IV2|4|It rained alot on our trip and the padding slid backwards a bit. It also damaged the paint on the top of our car. But it did its job so were satisfied.
B000CNJAYC|1|This fan does not have NEAR the cooling capacity of the stock Ford fan I have come to find out. DO NOT USE THIS ON A VEHICLE YOU TOW WITH!!!! Also after only two years on my vehicle many parts were very rusted and one in particular so much that one of the fans fell off.
B004A56ZPU|5|This was exactly what I needed for my 1978 2500 Chevy Van. My old vent window latches were getting loose and not holding the windows shut anymore and then I bought these ones. They lock right into place and hold the windows perfectly.
B004AIHKT2|5|Just what I needed thanks!
B00K7935KQ|5|Perfect black license plate covers to replace the ugly ones the dealer puts on your car.
B00Z9FN0DU|1|Didnt even fit in the sockets
B00B6CEM3C|5|Delivered quickly. Works just as advertised.
B00Z2RCCE8|2|Good enough if you keep your speed under 55 mph
B00T20TO9W|5|Just the right size
B00LXBENYY|5|Worked perfect!  Simple to swap out the guts. I think one reviewer complained that it did not have the ford logo on the back like the original, well, the one I received had the ford logo and it was actually BETTER than the original.<br /><br />Extra note: I was CONSTANTLY setting off my alarm by accidentally pressing the alarm button.  Whether it was the keyfob in my pocket or it was when I had it in my hand with other items.  So.... since I don't ever expect to be tackled in a parking lot, I disabled my by simply removing the small round metal contact piece on the underside of the button.  I kept it in case I ever want to re-install in the event that I sell the vehicle etc.
B008CLM7VO|4|Just as everyone else reviewed, these are pricey, high-quality, but the screws! Stupid thing is, these rock boards/nerf bars are pre tapped for 10-31  stainless!  Somebody in management/accounting decided to save a few dollars and switch the stainless screws to some generic pieces of crap. Save yourself the time, take a trip to the hardware store, get some angled head stainless steel 10-32 screws and it'll be perfect with some Loctite or nylon nuts.
B004WWYRL0|5|Works as supposed to.
B00F1ZX9KM|5|Excellent product. Very well made and also very useful. I recommend this product to anyone looking for an item like this to buy. This is also a good company that shops very quickly to you...
B00G3EAGO2|5|Amazing clay bar for maintaining that show room feel!
B00RIVNP1K|5|Shipping time was great. I received the item within 3days after making the purchase. It fits great in our Equinox!
B00IIS5YZC|5|Fit perfectly.  I actually have a &#34;rhino clone&#34; (or are they really the same???)  At any rate, fit very well, packed very well, arrived very quick.  Installed in 15 minutes, which included time to remove my broken original shield.  My original was 1mm thicker.<br /><br />ONLY complaint is that there were no &#34;rubber grommets&#34; that my original had.  I reused my orig AND the original bar clamps as they were heavier duty.
B000IG7PMM|4|other than a little leak when i got the bottle, this oil is great. Its been in the truck for 1 year now and still working great
B005MESQPA|5|Good

B000W7GLB8|5|Perfect for my wife's CRV which we use for diving and the dogs
B010W6L654|1|Got a H4 Bi Xenon kit, very disappointing, Weird light pattern. The bulb has the shroud missing that blocks light from entering the HIGH Beam zone of the headlight through the opening in the main shield, when Low Beam is on. Therefore lots of stray light exits acting like you got High Beam on when in fact it's Low Beam. The picture they show of the bulb on Amazon has the shroud on it. So don't know what happen, maybe they changed bulbs, but it does not match what is being sold.  I am not into blinding oncoming traffic, too many drivers flashed me. I have another brand with shroud on bulb that has no issues. They are going back, too bad. Get your bulb fixed right and it would be great kit. This is the second kit like it. Had to gave it 1 star because it's not usable as is.<br /><br />PRO:<br />- The slim Ballast is great, takes about 10 sec to fully light up<br />- Easy to install but they all are the same regardless where you buy from<br /><br />CON's:<br />- Stray light from bulb<br />- weird light pattern blinding oncoming traffic<br />- bulb missing shroud to block light on Low Beam
B00UULX2ZE|5|I hesitated to buy this based on price alone. $25 for a plastic organizer seemed high, but honestly it's worth every penny. The plastic is sturdy and the organizer goes together perfectly for a tight fit inside the console. Very happy with my purchase and very happy that I can access everything in the console without digging through a mess.
B008Y36KCC|5|Perfect !!
B000CRAXNK|5|fit well
B005IV0FN8|5|Easy to install, they look great too. Definitely recommend these lights.
B00E7W2YS8|5|Love them. Made well and easy installation! Hold up against the wind and fast driving. Curl stays perfectly.
B002UCYRZU|5|Fantastic
B00MOKMYD0|5|They were easy to install with both sides labeled correctly for proper installation. They are sturdy and look great.  I shopped other ones for twice the cost and these have not made me regret buying the more expensive ones.
B000OUZYAW|5|It made my79 year old father so happy to roll around and work on his car,.... Nuff said
B004LX3AS6|5|Looked at the Battery Tender brand that I owned many years ago and decided I wanted something smaller and with newer technology. Bought the NOCO brand and was very pleased with the product. It took a little longer than I expected to charge my Harley battery but since I was not in a hurry it was not an issue. Have been using for about 1 month now and am very pleased with it. I would recommend this product.
B00I51L28K|4|I used the boot off this kit. The knob felt way too cheap. Don't throw your OEM one away!
B003TL6CMC|3|Electrical connections did not fit. Had to cut and splice wires to get mirror adjustment to work.
B000C7YQ2Y|1|This is the second one I have bought, because the first one broke on the first time I used it. Now this one just broke. For some reason the lock tumbler does not stay in the cap as you pull out the key.
B00FOSSQJU|5|Met my requirements for a fuel additive that was needed, especially to keep the injectors clean.
B000Z0HVHA|3|not necessary for the car charger light comes with a car charger. cost too much to return.
B00J9Y23SU|1|The mat did not fit.  I have a Ford Edge Titanium and it wasn't even close to fitting.  I previously owned two other Ford Edges and had Weather Tech in them.  I was disappointed that this wasn't acceptable.
B00ZY1MIFA|5|Lovely product
B00EECR98G|5|Good price fast delivery
B00OO1OCHI|5|fit and works great so far
B007Q4Y0GI|3|have yet to instal, but wanted to review, feels flimsy and cheap but will attach eventually, better than nothing at all.  if you want oem looking handle, this is not it.
B00B508A4M|1|One of cheapest made, over price floor mat out there. when they get wet, your slide off, won;t lay down flat,and won't stay in place. will sent back.
B00W1WGR5M|4|It fits well with my 2016 wrx

B002G27IAK|5|Awesome
B00U44GX9E|5|Nice shirt......True to size.....Fast Shipping.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Love this car shade, it works great.  I am surprised each time I get back in the car, that it doesn't feel that hot inside. Would recommend.
B008U9HO0C|5|This is what we were looking for. It worked perfectly. Very pleased with this item
B00HVTYWLG|3|haven't but them on yet but i like them
B00IJHWCSY|4|Appears to serve their purpose; although they are a bit flimsy.
B000EDQR3M|5|I spent 2 days fixing my broken screen door and decided I needed a push bar to keep the screen from getting damaged again.  The door I have is wood frame with aluminum insert that everyone always pushed on, it broke out the screws, broke the wood, pushed out the screen...after fixing I attached this and it worked great, but I noticed catching the door with 'the rump' when closing (automatic spring), so I bought another bar to put lower and works great.  The only thing I don't like is it makes an awful rattling noise when the metal clanks on each other.  I applied some silicone between the pieces and it helped.  Looks a bit tacky, but works great, bought another for my other door, so far they have held up great!
B001EMRSAS|5|Works great on my SBC ZZ4 motor.
B000NWA8YS|5|Like it
B0067QWTU0|5|Awesome! Bought for my 2012 civic si coupe and fits perfectly. Front, rear and full back seat floor mats<br /><br />8/29/15-
B000GVBY8K|5|They fit nice and look good. Replaced ugly buckhorn barns
B000GU3EB6|5|Fast delivery.  Works perfect and fits great.
B004IA94JQ|5|I bought the SAE wrenches at the same time. Both have worked just fine.
B00ZQ3AJI4|4|Came in sooner then the eta was given. Fit perfect straight bolt on. Time will tell on how long they will last but for the price will not complain.  Way cheaper then most parts stores also.
B006JXSNGA|3|very small rope and hooks but still works to secure small things
B00FZFYJ2K|5|.It's was a great feeling ordering an item, and it was the correct part. What a relief.
B00MYS1UIM|5|This product did a great job restoring the color on our 12 year old leather seats. The seats look close to new again. Very pleased.
B00O83SIQI|5|Fits my 88 silverado... fresh!<br />Order some led reverse lights 2😉
B00M1LI5VM|2|It lasted for 2 weeks and then it flew off my wheels, the adhesive remained on the wheels but the rubber itself flew off
B005M16QY6|1|No
B008SEM724|5|Installed easily in about 10 minutes each.<br />Pleased with the product...
B0084AA2LK|1|Did not work as advertised . Not worth what it cost with the delivery costs.
B0009IQXXG|5|Great Service and Product
B000C9FX74|5|These were delivered promptly and were the correct fitment. Nicely machined and properly shipped, and they went on without a problem. I haven't put that many miles on yet, but they bedded in well and are providing good stopping power without any odd noises or vibrations. Great transaction!
B00HL2EAYW|5|A+++
B002PMOPOS|5|best filter
B00062YUUS|5|set my dwell right on the money, very good price and fast delivery.
B00XV5YCFA|5|Love it
B004HCS4PK|5|I've used Mequiar's products for years but nothing they have ever made surpassed all my expectations like  Ultimate Past Wax. It will amaze you and will make you happy each and every time you wash your car, the water will bead off like you've never seen before. Summer is almost over, order a can of this wax now and prepare that ride for winter.
B004SCETXU|5|I bought this for my Honda CRV which does not have any  licence plate frame to place my licence plate. I used this along with zip ties and it worked perfect. All hardware came with the kit.
B00SBZRR8O|5|Just like the ad states, this will help your back. I am getting older and my hands are not as strong as they used to be so holding a gas can up to fill a mower, blower, etc... has become almost impossible. This fit right onto my 5 gallon gas can and works a charm. Highly recommended.
B000COS56K|5|Great price and works very well.<br />Thanks Moroso
B0016KFX3C|5|Awesome, easy install. Be sure to have a telescoping magnetic stick and a piece of yarn would help to fish the parts through. Will need to drill a little also, be sure to paint exposed metal!
B000630204|5|Nice , great delivery.<br />Thanks<br />Spectre
B00167VG90|5|Great product, I thought it could have gotten here a couple of days earlier but all in all I am very happy with these mirrors.
B00M4M0FCK|5|#1 the bristles are white #2 I'm 98% sure it's the same as the carpet brush the bristles are pretty soft but my tires don't get that dirty and they are low profile so the brush works perfect besides the different color ect. im gonna order some more
B00VL4OJJC|2|THEY WOULD HAVE GOT A BETTER REVIEW BUT THEY WILL NOT TIGHTEN UP TIGHT ENOUGH SO WHEN I REST MY FEET ON THEM THEY SLIP,MOVE. THEY DON'T HOLD ON TO THE BARS ON CANYON CAGE!
B007RHX0ZG|5|Worked like a charm - probably saved $150 dollars doing it myself
B00DB9AADY|4|Nice lights....perfect fit only drawback is no wire diagram...
B001EYHK9U|5|Very satisfied with strap.
B004IME2ZK|5|Works great!
B004P23VQO|5|It took a little longer than I  thought it would to put on the first time, but I love it.  Aesthetically and functionally this top is great!!
B003ASZAB8|5|Works great for my needs I use it on my tractor to pull a cart and other items would recommend this ball mount.
B00VS0T7IC|5|Very happy with this purchase.  Very easy to use.
B00EVMT6A8|5|Perfect
B000C2SJJA|5|Fit as it should.  No problems.
B00OTMES3A|4|I own a 2006 Legacy GT, it was a perfect fit. It sound great for the price and it's a fairly easy install if you are doing it at home. It comes with everything like gaskets and bolts. The catback exhaust will only fit the turbocharged Legacys like the GT, GT limited and the Spec-B. The exhaust set up in the 2.5i is slightly different do to the fact there is no turbo so the engine doesn't create as much heat or pressure... I highly recommend if you have a turbo charged model Legacy like me.
B00480GYF8|4|way stronger than my stock lights but not incredibly incredibly strong.
B00PYQC3BO|4|needs modification but worth the effort.
B00877SL2M|3|Three of the leds did not even function... but the rest have stood the test of time in my Evo's plate light sockets. I would still recommend them but only for something sheltered from the elements; like a dome light.
B0066RI08U|5|Great factory replacement.
B00407XA2Y|1|Huge disappointment!!  The color in the can did not match the lid AT ALL.  Except for that it was in a red shade the color that came out of the can was like fire engine red and NOT metallic!  The lid is a metallic burgundy.  I sprayed my $300 kitchenaid mixer with this hideous color and now have to figure out a way to get myself out of this mess.  If I had used it on my toreador red car and sprayed it on, I would have been livid!  Its almost as if a few lids fell off in the warehouse and the workers just randomly put lids back on with out knowing which can to actually put them on!
B004HEBN1A|4|EXCELLENT PRODUCT for the money compared to smitybyilt and other leading roof racks that cost $400-600 bucks, only difference is its made with lesser gage metal and bolted together instead of welded but you can't tell the difference it's very sturdy when bolted together and we'll built, the paint is not the best and arrived chipped and scratched but that's understandable for the price so I automatically painted it with some rustolium flat back paint cans to protect it which cost 3 cans for $15 bucks total overall very satisfied. Looks great!
B0051D3MP6|5|Excellent charger. Works great!
B0130NLX8G|5|We always need extra space in our car to store things. Especially since we have a 7 year old son sitting in the back seat. This bag comes in handy to store kid items, grocery items, and takeouts.<br /><br />Here's what I like about this bag:<br />- Convenient and quick access to items than storing in the trunk.<br />- Large storage space, can store lots of items, about the size of a grocery bag.<br />- Storage nets on 3 sides for more storage space.<br />- Foldable, both top and bottom. Fold top to hide what's inside the bag. Fold top and bottom when the bag is empty (fold flat) to allow ease of access to back seat.<br />- Sturdy, good quality, and good looking.<br />- Easy to attach to back of seat, hook under headrest.<br />- Inside of the bag is waterproof.<br /><br />Good convenient storage bag to have inside the car that I highly recommend.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
B004JKW2J4|5|I bought this, along with Pro Series 63153 Rambler Hitch Cargo Carrier for 2&#34; Receivers (Automotive), and ended up being the perfect combination.  This, along with the rack is 24&#34; wide, and when I first viewed the rack and this bag, I thought I had made a mistake in buying a size that was too big, and that perhaps I should have bought something with a 20&#34; width.  Once I packed the unit for the trip back home, however, I was very glad I bought this size, as we were able to get almost all of the stuff from our Tahoe into this unit, and then had room for our dog to have it's own seat.  The quality of this was absolutely first class.  Very heavy duty.  The locations on the bag where the tie down straps hooked were very heavily reinforced, similar to what you would see on an expensive river raft.  Tie down straps were plenty long enough, and our stuff stayed dry even with multiple rainstorms in our 1250 mile trip.  I cannot think of one single negative thing to say about this purchase, and I can be very critical.
B0073X3R5M|5|Great product. Lightening speed delivery!
B00U98Y69O|5|Drive gel cushions are well-made.  This one can tie to the seat of my husband's scooter so it doesn't slide around.  The other cushion we bought is in his manual wheelchair.  We love the gel cushions!
B005PZMLDY|3|I have 2015 Civic SE, here is my experience with the covers.  Pros: 1. The material.feels nice in hands, but probably not so durable. 2. Fit reasonably well, although not perfect (too big). 3. The installation guides on their website was somewhat helpful.  Cons: 1. The backseat cover is borderline impossible to put on completely. 2. Leaves visible marks. For example, if you leave your keys on the seat and sit on it, you will end up seeing visible marks on the cover for days.  Backseat covers included in my package are two solid pieces. Putting the cover on the part where you sit on wasn't a problem, but the piece that covers the back cushion literally does not fit since 2015 Civic has three separate pieces for the back cushion. I managed to put the cover on the part of where you sit on. It was so difficult to get the backseat cushion off in the first place. Of course that's not the manufacturer's fault, but rather it was Honda that made it a difficult task. I had to go through several Youtube videos to figure out how to take it off. Once I got done with the seating cushion, I realized the part where you lean your backs on are composed of 3 separate pieces. I have no idea how would one solid piece of cover cover three separate pieces especially considering the back cushion left no rooms on the two sides (no rooms to wrap the cover around it).  If you have a 15 Civic like I do, save yourself some time and buy another set that's easier to put on.
B0016KA9RW|5|My Grandson looked so cute in the outfit.
B00B1UL0IO|5|Perfect, just exactly what we needed when we needed it!
B0039Z5TYU|5|I've had reflect a gold on the end tanks of my stock intercooler for about a year now. Put simply, it works. This tape is especially effective on the turbo side, as it only gets to about above lukewarm even after hard daily driving. Not too hot to the touch on either side of your hand. The throttle side stays even cooler than that consistently. I even had enough left over to line the underside of a grimmspeed heat shield! Definitely a good mod to tide you over till you upgrade to a bigger intercooler, in which case I will repurchase to apply onto as well. Highly recommended!
B00ARUPXTQ|5|Fit my 2003 Expedition perfectly. Also received it very quickly.
B00TXQ8UTK|4|satisfied
B007D7QOH6|5|Still going strong after a few months.  Rapid delivery and an excellent product
B00PK0VKK4|2|The seat covers comes with attachments and NO INSTRUCTIONS!  I had to rig these seat covers to fit.  On the white strip are patches of brown paint.  I am very disappointed in these seat covers.  Do not buy!
B0000AXY62|1|I recently purchased a used motorhome. It had one of these locks installed in the receiver. I don't know how long it had been there but I decided that because I didn't know it's history I could not trust it. I drilled out the lock and and pulled the pin out of the receiver. It's a good thing I trusted my instincts as the pin had two stress fractures on it and it showed other signs of wearing. I suspect that had I decided to just use it as is then it could have ended in catastrophe as it wouldn't have been long before it failed. Suggestion: If you have one of these locks make sure you inspect it on a regular basis for wear and stress fractures. If it shows any signs of wear then throw it away, don't use it!
B00GYDBPL0|5|I loved it, it's very pretty and seems durable!
B00NMQEINY|1|The damn things didn't work and the company won't return my calls for help, useless don't buy anything from this company.
B00MN92QI0|1|Trying to return it
B000COX484|5|Fast shipping and great price. It's the same as the OEM part so it fit and works very  well.
B000C41LAC|5|The product  work perfectly. May wish to consider  recycling  old products to remanufacture.
B0083Y0WL2|5|It was better than I expected! Definitely saved me a lot of money!!!
B00BD5GSWA|2|Ordered this for my Fiat 500 Abarth listing said it would fit, however it doesn't work w/my car. I made it work by using the bucket seat covers for my back seat & the bench seat cover.
B0031HEIDY|5|Great bulbs.
B0115LTXFA|1|Sticks out about 2 inches past the bumper. Looks out of place from side of vehicle. Im going to have to cut it drill and tap to get it closer to bumper. Also the whole plate bracket is held on with 1 small screw. Not sturdy enough. Plate can be spun with not much force.<br /><br />Updated: removed 1 more star due to the fact that their customer support says this is how it is supposed to fit. Im sorry, but this is not a good fit. Their excuse is that you need hand room to install, which is wrong. Im going to keep the thing and modify it to fit properly. Shouldnt have to for 40 bucks though. I urge everyone who is looking at this to spend the extra 30 bucks on the grimmspeed.<br /><br />Another update, i ground back the taper on the aluminum tow hook bar and got it threaded in further. It looks better, but still not perfect. Ill probably take another half inch or so off soon.
B0039Z3SRA|5|I used to mount speakers in roof of ranget
B001GCMAUY|5|My husband wanted these as he just bought his first Harley Davidson bike. He wanted some good riding boots. I actually own the same identical boots but the actual Harley Brand, I bought about 12 years ago and still love them. The ONLY difference is the Harley emblems otherwise they are identical even in quality. He thinks they are very comfortable and great protection for riding. He has worn them for long rides even in the heat, he thinks they are great and his feet don't tire or get too hot.
B00OA66IG0|5|son loves this product
B00CRJCGZY|5|Perfect size to throw in the trucks tool box, along with that spare filter.  Makes that unscheduled filter change on the road easy!!

B00DKWJA1K|5|Know I have more protection for my Ram dash
B000C5608O|5|Very good part. Fits well and looks to be as good as or better than the OEM part I removed. Truck tracks better with the new ball joints. For the money Moog parts are great. I will purchase again when the time comes.
B001XUD46S|5|Know my Ram have more protection
B004SS8DCM|2|nice size material is skimpy
B000N3W8J0|4|Not much to review, it catches dirt from your wash mitt while placed in a bucket
B008Y7R4M8|5|Good parts shipped fast works great
B0025CXPYY|5|This worked great.  I read reviews for similar items that reported the tool bending and such.  I had no such problem with this one - it worked great.
B00RTLUPVC|5|good
B001PWFPE8|3|This works great but the hardware isn't stainless or galvanized so its going to rust quickly.
B00YHILLCW|4|The mirrors look cheap and one of them had a small scratch when I received them.  I put them on my Toyota Sienna, and they do the job.

B000YPR4YG|5|easy Install.
B00LK35H4U|5|As advertised. Oem
B00N0DLNZA|5|Great switch though somewhat confusing, at least it was for me. I'm going to try and simplify how to wire this bad boy. After playing around with the switch for a while, and ruining one (I had to buy another), I figured out how to properly wire it up. You basically need two positive wires. In my attached pictures, the two white wires are positive, the black is negative, and the blue is the switch wire. I spliced my positive and just put another lead on it to give me the two. With that being said, just run the positive and negative on the top and bottom pins, then run the other positive and the switch wire on the outermost pins (it doesn't matter if you switch them around, so long as they are both connected).<br /><br />Note that the led is ALWAYS on, whether the switch is activated or not.<br /><br />I hope this helps.
B00KY0DM56|5|This fit my 1992 F150 with 300 CID Six Cylinder Perfectly.  A really good deal.
B009DK9IGU|5|This is one of the best investment's i made. I have a '99 crown victoria and the thermostat housing cracked. It was a no brainer to go with EVEN FISHER. Good quality,better design. Had a mechanic friend install it. Very happy.

B00GXHUXV0|5|It definitely stands out in a crowd of cars and is perfect for my silver TARDIS
B00MVMMIA0|5|Nice bright white light slightly brighter than original incandescent bulb that was replaced.  Less power consumption too.
B00CRYMEKG|5|I got this as a replacement after breaking the ring on the top of the last one.  It works PERFEFT, and was very easy to switch everything out.  It also arrived before the estimated date.
B004B2GL6U|4|Fits perfect! Plastic clips poor quality!
B0009X9F72|5|Worked great and was worth the price
B007M5QGRM|5|Very easy to install and high quality
B00FJSIPPA|1|It doesn't work.  Over and over and over again it doesn't work.  It worked for a little while, now it doesn't.  Tech support is very nice, but only works M-F 9-5 EST which means they are never there when I have time to try and figure this out.  They even sent me another VCI and it still doesn't work. &#34;VCI cannot communicate with tool&#34; over and over again.  Is my laptop broken?  No.  It works with everything else.  When in doubt blame Windows I guess.
B002UC19R4|5|Excellent product and easy to install in my RV.
B00S8JNBTM|1|Resistors did not work. Emailed seller describing the problem and I was issued a refund.
B003G97FBY|5|excellent product.
B00FADIZYA|4|Can't find them anywhere else other than a dealer.  These clipped on differently but they still work great.
B000Y87R4K|2|NICE LOOKING DECK FILL. VERY POORLY MADE.  THE OUTER DIAMETER IS NOT 3 1/8 INCHES ITS JUST UNDER 3 INCHES. SO THE DESCRIPTION IS WRONG . WHEN I RETURNED THIS ITEM TO AMAZON I TOLD THEM ABOUT THIS AND THEY HAVE NOT CHANGED IT YET. THE ITEM IS CHEAP SO I GUESS YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. I RETURNED IT AND WENT WITH MY ORIGINAL IDEA, SPENT THE $60.00 AND HAVE WHAT I NEED.
B00IPA1O6Q|5|Great product!!!
B00LIUNX0K|4|Not a perfect fit for 2001 Jetta diesel
B0021YZER2|4|Pleasantly surprised how effective it work on hard water spots on glass showers. Will use again to get remaining spots off. Would definitely recommend to anyone with this issue!!
B00065JM8U|5|Great
B0109QWR9Q|1|Junk no good I would never buy this item got to get it from de dealer I waste my money
B008KZQTHA|5|Great was just what I needed.
B00JL7ZSZK|5|Instructions were a little weird. But once you figure out one side, the other side will be quick. Fits perfect.
B00KMYYQ5O|5|Great stuff. Put it on boat lift canopy using paint roller. Too windy for sprayer.
B00S8WEFMQ|5|Great price and looks good!!
B000C5E3HY|5|Perfect fit, installation took about 10 seconds. Just what I needed
B002YKDJ3O|5|Frikin awesome
B001GMX93G|5|Great price. Easy to install
B001EP292C|5|good to go
B00HRZVC6W|5|Fits my vehicle as advertised. I would recommend. A little less than the dealer in terms of cost and very similar product, if not the same.
B000BGHYJS|5|An easy fix for a slow leaking tank valve. Opted not to pay the big expense to cut out the bottom to access old valve for repairs. Added this at the outlet and it has worked flawlessly since. If you can afford or able to make the correct repairs on a leaking valve do that...otherwise, this is a viable option!
B000IZ7XAC|1|The nuts are listed as fitting a Chevrolet 2500 HD truck. They are at least 1/4 inches short and do not reach the threads on the lug nut. Assuming they fit, I installed all 16 on two hub caps. Since I opened all 4 packages  I am unable to return.
B0044B30TO|5|This is an OEM filter it allowed me to save $50.00 in dealer fees to change it. It is really easy to do.
B004I8M03K|5|Exactly what I needed. New OE style at an unbeatable price. Crystal clear lighting and grants you full adjustability so you don't get stuck with cheap knock offs that aim up into the trees. Just make sure you remember to put the screw that locks in the corner markers or they will pop out!
B00TJ8ECF8|1|I bought a pair of these mirrors to put on my commander, after only 2 days of trail riding, the plastic flange that connects to the clamp broke, I contacted the seller, who sent me another pair, it did take three weeks however to get them, then after another couple trail rides, the same plastic mount broke.  These mirrors will not withstand the vibration of trail riding. Not much good. Now I am trying to get my money back.
B00MEPIRQ8|5|good
B00BOFTOP2|5|quick shipping is about all there is to say, I mean it's a shorty antenna and it adds style love it what else can I say everybody seen them
B000FCEOT6|5|Great fit, reduces heat inside car,  rolls up and secures with velcro.
B00OCGD34I|5|Easy to install and a nice way to spruce up your interior. This kit even included 2 plastic shims to assist in removing the bulb covers. Real easy to install and makes the interior bright and modern looking. No more yellowish color; just bright white. The trickiest ones are the license plate ones but since I have owned other Honda/Acura vehicles, it is easier and faster to replace.
B000CB7DG6|5|OEM, for my BMW 330Ci.
B0089IFQR2|5|Nice look and fit
B0021KZFCA|5|Works great
B007KCXNJ6|5|Perfect replacement.  3 screws and your done.
B00ENNQIP6|5|I already installed the hid 50w kit in two of my cars in march of 2015.i ordered the bulbs for my third car that came with factory 4300 k hid bulbs.made a huge difference these 8000k bulbs are brighter and also the light is slightly blue which enhances the apperance factor.very happy with the product.No flicker or any other problems thus far.
B00IPS3LRS|5|Exactly as described.
B00NQ198LC|5|Just what i was looking for, sturdy, well made and cost was less than anywhere I could find them  Thanks
B001GMN6FM|5|bought for my wife, she loves it.
B00CXAC5MG|5|Just what I needed to get generator power to my camper. Appears well made and durable.
B003U4P3U0|5|Get suds and great wax for a awesome wash! If you like wax in the soap this is it!
B004DRYQ3I|5|Looks great.  Fit great.  Price was great
B004AEQSE4|5|Just like the previous reviews said- only product that doesn't require a lot of &#34;compressed-air&#34; time to remove the product. Works great!
B0013I2GJQ|5|Great color and good brightness. When the lights aren't on, the housing shines blue a little bit, which is awesome. Thank you!
B001PY9D2Q|1|The pushrod would not snap in the master cylinder on first one I ordered.  It took so much force that it broke the plastic piece holding the slave cylinder pushed in and the slave cylinder piston blew out onto the ground.  Got a replacement took off the plastic piece on slave and installed slave in the transmission so the slave piston would not blow out and tried to install the pushrod on master cylinder.  I put a extreme amount of force on it and the push rod would not go in.  Talked two Dorman technical help guys and did not even know what he was talking about one of them said if the piston blew out you do not have to bleed it because it is pre bled.<br />Also on one of them had very little brake fluid, there was some fluid in cylinders but the resovor was dry so it was not prebled.
B00JA3BMDW|5|Does the job!  Great product, great price
B007NLQO0O|4|Keeps my Subaru well maintained with fresh filters and Rotella T6
B000N32110|5|Is what it said it is.
B0133WU3K8|5|For a 2015 VW Golf S  TDI 4 door.  Install was incredibly easy.  It took 15 minutes including the 5 minutes it took to get the cardboard box open.  Everything lined up well and was perfect.  I am more than thrilled.  Fit and finish was perfect.  Thank you CURT
B00BIA2P9A|5|Excellent MF towels!
B00F8KUTWQ|5|Most excellent!
B00BTSFN54|5|I own three motorcycle helmets and have one of these on each of them.  I have used two of them for intercom communication numerous times and they work extremely well; they are loud, clear, and easy to use.  They are also easy to link to each other.<br />I use it even more often riding solo to listen to music and make calls.  The music controls are very intuitive.  The dynamic range on the speakers isn't very good, but is acceptable as it is hard to accomplish in slim speakers to fit in a helmet.  The calls come in loud and clear and most people that I talk to have no idea that I am on my motorcycle, even  traveling at ~70 mph with my visor open.<br />I am obviously very happy with this headset that I have made it a repeat purchase.<br /><br />There are a couple features that would be nice to have, such as bluetooth layering.  And the voice controls could be better also, but aren't necessary to operation of the headset.<br /><br />This comes with two different microphones and plenty of attachment options for each part of the system such as adhesive tape and velcro for the mic, the battery, and the headset.<br /><br />I had an issue with the microphone on my most recent headset and I contacted Sena after everything had been installed.  The customer service was excellent and they sent me a replacement in short order.<br /><br />I would recommend this headset and would purchase this again if necessary.
B00C53LZTK|5|works great ,programed different from instructions, should be turn key off and on 5 times
B002PQQDOO|1|I have a 2007 Toyota 4runner Sport Edition V8. The headlights fit perfectly. The main issue is that the headlight bulb SOCKET, Turn Signal bulb socket, and the parking light bulb socket does not fit inside. I have duck tape holding the bulbs in place. I have reported the issue with the company and they asked me to return the headlights. I can not return the headlights because they are already installed on my vehicle and I'm not going to spend more money on labor in taking them off and I don't have anything to replace it with. Duck tape will have to do for now. It's time like this I wish I would of purchased the headlights directly from Toyota instead of trying to save a couple hundred on aftermarket.
B00BD4SMWK|5|They fit great in my car
B003MXKVJ2|5|It fit
B009B43VF2|4|DOES NOT HAVE MOOG GREASEABLE BALL JOINT
B007ACI9UY|3|Dimensions on the description is way off. It's a decent construction but you're given some cords to secure it to the sissy bar. You can fit some water bottles and some small items but not much else. It looks great but just not very functional.
B00KTIX6J0|5|Great experience.
B000B6DG54|1|Satisfied with the paint coverage. As other reviewers have mentioned the brush is low quality. This paint is not heat resistant. The paint on my front calipers bubbled. Now I need to put in a considerable amount of work to fix the flaw. My rear calipers look great so if your applying to ricer this will most likely work out for you. If your applying to street performance or track car look elsewhere.
B00H7HD9DO|1|The quality is s***, it's like wear and tear quality. If you have a ford focus do not get this it's a waste, and it don't even fit properly.  . It's really a one and half star, only good thing was it came on time. The mats are pretty good worth about $29.00, but still don't fit in my car ughhhh super upset....
B000WO8MKY|5|Very comfortable grips. Reduced vibration lag and strain on hands and legs a LOT over stock grips on a KLR250, and were also wonderful on my KLR650 as well. Trimming may be needed for your application, but that is easy.
B0013REXO8|4|Looks good installed easily.
B003YOF66C|5|Deleivery was quick and product met expetations
B000NU87PM|5|its in my F 150
B000EDQR3M|4|It worked fine on our front screen door with modifications. I had to send the second one back because my back door was smaller and it would not fit. It is 32 inches whereas my front door was 36 inches.
B00JA3BMDW|5|Quality product. Fast delivery.
B00JTIP8ZQ|5|The curve feature is definitely cool and it's only extreme from looking at it from behind. I also purchased six 8&#34; black covers which completed the look........nice!!!
B003SYHA0S|5|Great price and easy to install. It even came with the bulbs which was a bonus. I callled places to try to get a replacement. The prices ranged anywhere from $50-80. Would deal with this seller again.
B000CB3X4W|5|Great price and easy to install.  Glad I can still get refills.
B00TUKY03O|4|Worked well  in our 2003 Ford F150.
B00KULAV8K|1|How can i rate it, it when its not the right match?
B005G5RMP0|1|Absolute trash...it looks like someone just quickly carved up some plastic in their garage. didn't even fit...will absolutely be sending back.
B000KL38U8|1|Poor  fit!!! I don't know who was on the lazor that day but they must have been sleeping. did not contact the company .I fill if you advertise you are the best, you have to take the heat. dollar for dollar not worth it.
B0064QUWS4|5|Very nice. Delivered quickly. I'm happy with purchase.
B00R54ULN0|5|Very high quality, as in all of the Rag Company products you can't beat their microfiber line up.
B000RH20T0|5|Great for road trips, held more than I needed for the weekend. I have a wide pad for passenger back rest and the velcro straps are too short for it. I managed to secure it with another strap, extention straps can also be purchased from manufacturer, S&H costs more than the straps. Pack stayed in place, had it sitting on the seat instead of rack. Easy to put on and take off.
B0002NUNKW|5|I trust 3M products to work as expected.  Enough said.
B004IY5HMK|5|I have this on my 2012 Honda Fit for pulling our 14' fishing boat. Works great, don't have to worry about scraping anymore!
B000HS4QA0|5|Very comfortable, good instructions, love em.
B000CMF4UC|5|Gorilla automotive &#34;The System&#34; turns all your lug nuts to wheel locks. Creating 5 locks per wheel (in my case) to locks instead of just one.
B002HRNP8S|4|The product arrived in a neat package. Took 5 minutes to place on my car and it works very well.
B00EPQUH3A|5|Perfect fit
B003UT5VKW|4|So far so good. Got some stains out of a seat that a foam type cleaner didn't get out. Cleaned up some floor stains with a little help from a brush. Cut it and put it in a spray bottle gallon should last a long time.  Smells nice.
B0031BTF92|5|Doesn't blow off my head. Grips fine at 70.
B008OYV53K|4|They looked great on my 2013 Kia Optima. The only complaint is the trunk emblem started to weather after approximately 24 months. Other than that, it gave the vehicle a cleaner more stylish look.
B006WAQDGM|1|When I purchased this, it was thru another page and people posted that it fits their 2007 mini cooper S...  Wrong! does not fit and you can't safely drive because of mis match.
B00R1XEPFU|4|These are ok, but I do have a complaint about the variety of characters. For one thing there's no teenagers or big kids. I have two teens, a ten year old, and a baby...I had to make the oldest three all the same size. I only have one baby, but what if I had twin boys or girls? There's is only one boy and one girl baby.
B000V9FWTE|5|It works great for my 91 yj... Unfortunately they forgot to pack the fasteners with it, the instructions say that they are included but I could not find them anywhere... I did not contact Rampage but I'm sure they would have assisted me. The center console is as advertised which is why I give it 5stars..
B007IKOX7Q|5|Great product
B00D1CQVIY|4|Great product
B00HCMYKK0|1|Awesome design. IF ONLY the sticker came off after applying!;!!!
B00LL6PK2K|4|Since I travel so much I usually keep a few automotive essentials in my vehicle like oil, a few paper towels,wind shield washer fluid and of course a tire pressure gauge. In the past I've always had the traditional style tire pressure gauge.  I could never quite tell if it was working properly or if I was even reading it properly.  That's why I decided to purchase the Best Digital Tire Pressure Gauge, with a digital read out it takes all the guess work out of the equation. It's made checking my cars tire pressure a breeze. Unlike other tire pressure gauges this one comes equipped with a blue LCD light. The blue LCD light works wonderfully it allows you to be able to check your tires pressure in the very early hours of the morning or even at night. It's perfect because if a time or situation should arise and you would need to check it in non day light hours you are prepared to do so. Being prepared for any situation is always best practice, especially when it comes to things going wrong with your vehicle.<br /> The larger size  of the numbers on the digital read out makes it cinch to read your tires pressure. The width and design of this tire pressure gauge is made so it fits comfortably in the palm of your hand. It has scalloped edges so you know exactly where to place your fingers for a nice firm grip.  It comes packaged with six very basic and easy to follow steps on how to use it. It also gives you the option on which unit of measurement you want to see your read out in. It gives you a choice of PSI, KPA, BAR, or Kg/cm<br />You don't have to worry about turning it off either. The best part is, that  you can either hold the button for three seconds and cut it off manually or it has a thirty second automatic shut off on it.  The automatic thirty second shut off works best for me because it seems that I always forget to turn stuff off and inevitably kill the batteries in my stuff. I can't tell you how many times I've gone to use something and discovered the batteries were dead.<br />My husband is a mechanic and got really excited when he opened the package he thought it was for him, the look on his face when i told him it was for me was priceless.  I let him try it out and know he wants one for work. Looks like I know exactly what to get him for his birthday. Although I'll probably end up getting him two. One for his own personal vehicle and one for his toolbox at work.<br /> I purchased this item at a discounted rate in exchange for testing it and giving an honest review of my findingss were dead.<br />My husband is a mechanic and got really excited when he opened the package he thought it was for him, the look on his face when i told him it was for me was priceless.

B001GJ3FIS|2|Just ok - not great quality but the does the job.
B00G620ZVU|5|I was very impressed with these. I put one on the front of my zero turn mower for when i get caught late in the evening mowing and man, it is great. I would put more of these on my truck for back lighting, and may put some on the front bumper for off roading. They are plenty bright for what I needed, and fairly heavy duty; the bracket is a little thin though, but as long as you aren't banging it into piles of mud or brush they'll be fine.
B000ABE9BK|5|Search no further! I couldn't find this in Any Auto Parts store. Who knows why. It's only available here so don't waste your time looking.If you've used it you know what it does. Simply the best De-Greaser/cleaner on this planet. Just wear some gloves unless you like getting Hang-Nails.
B000C5CELG|5|Works good
B00AJTL5K6|5|Great to deal with. No problems.
B00VHMJRI6|1|Camera came DOA. After reading that others had to return one or two of them before they got one that worked I decided to spend a little more money to get something that definitely works and won't crap out. Especially since I don't want to cut a hole in my bumper for this camera, have it not work, get frustrated, but another camera that might be a different size, so different size hole in the bumper. No thanks, that's a little too much pissing in the wind for me.
B000X9EGFS|5|This is a compact portable air compressor with a big heart.  Great for camping or garage.
B003XGYDE2|1|THIS PRODUCT CAME MISSING PIECES AND DID NOT PROFORM AS IT STATED IT WOULD . WAS NOT ABLE TO BLOW UP ONE STICKEN THING. UNFORTUNATELY UNABLE TO RETURN DUE TO MY INABILITY TO TRY OUT THIS PRODUCT DUE TO ILLNESS. WOULD NEVER BUY ANOTHER ONE OF THESE . VERY BIG ---GINORMOUS---MISTAKE. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.
B001C6JCBE|4|Order this hose for a 87' Toyota Pickup and the hose it was a couple of inches shorter from length. The material is was great and everything else. Just the length was slightly shorter.
B00CXAD2FK|1|this motorcycle is garbage my son only used it like 4 times and then it broke I called the company to replace the part and they took like a month to send it after I put the part my son did not have the chance to ride it because the piece broke again I would not recommend it to anyone to buy this bike.
B007QEAU2Q|5|product arrived in perfect condition and worked as advertised.
B004YWTZEM|4|good value for the price
B001P11SCM|5|Great product. Works awesome.
B000WK713C|5|good deal arrived on time
B00008RW9V|3|Use then for baseboards and miniblinds~~they do the job, but they don't make them like they used to, Sound familiar?
B004B2GL6U|5|Excellent Product
B000H3Q2FC|5|Perfect for my backpack
B000GU121K|3|Nice, only if it fits on my bike like it should. It's a good thing I'm handy and do special machine work with a mechanic experience. So, I modified the attaching stud with my own machined bolts and bushings to make it work. I'm happy with the pegs because the out come was fabulous for a faction of what they appear to be anywhere else! Don't buy it unless can do your own modifications yourself! Good luck!
B000E2CVI8|5|So easy to install and remove. No more crushed filters that won't come off. Will never use one without a nut on end again. Ten second removal with ratchet extension. No problem on my 50 HP Yamaha boat motor or 950cc motorcycle which uses the same one.
B00K779ICM|5|Fit our RV perfectly.
B00AN80YGO|1|Nice bolts but not all the ones in the photo are included in the kit
B005JPH4HS|4|I'm not a pro, I just do my own cars. As a mechanic, I love the fact that they are double sided bonnets.<br />And the 3M quality, makes them last longer than an average one.
B008KQ9OHQ|5|Small amounts of distortion it would seem. But it's not bad.
B002J858HQ|4|smells good, but doesn't last long
B00VR6ZXR6|4|Arrived a little later than stated, look great
B00OZ115Z4|1|I purchased this item to replace a set of rizoma rear sets that were damaged in an accident. These are the barriers that I ran into whilst installing them.<br /><br />MISSING PARTS: These did not include screws to attach the carbon fiber heel guards.<br /><br />INCORRECT PARTS: the brake side fit with the exception that the bracket that holds the brake cylinder was not manufactured correctly resulting in .5 inch play when operating the brake. The shifter side was not even remotely correct. If I didn't have the old remnants from my rizoma set I would have been SOL. I had to use the adjustable portion of the mounting bracket as well as the shift linkages from the old set to make this work . The ones that came with the set would not have worked with any amount of modification.<br /><br />SHODDY MANUFACTURING: In addition to the brake set having an abundance of play, it also flexes due to a design that is not strong enough to support the pressure from the foot pedal to the brake &#34;pump&#34;.
B00BVPU4J0|5|UPDATE: 5/18/16 It worked great but now broke again, wouldnt recommend unless you plan on replacing the same part a year later.    It fixed my problem in my 2004 honda accord in my front passenger. All the other locks worked except this one and this was the item needed.
B004H78NQ0|1|These are NOT OEM parts - they are a knock off from China...
B00HG0A2NM|1|This is not heavy duty as advertised.  The arms are not a solid bent piece of aluminum.  The inside of the arm is welded at 3 points.  The weak weld cracks and then catches.  One trip out and it ripped like paper.  Called Pro Armor and emailed photo, but they were not helpful.  They said they'd sell me a single arm for $99.  Don't waste your money!  Look for one that is a solid piece.
B00G0HA4OY|5|Fit perfectly on my 328i and about $20 cheaper than the price I was quoted at the dealer. You just have yo get it painted at your local paint shop (just like you would if you purchased from the dealer). Worked on my BMW.
B006B2ABC8|4|Fit my 2006 TRX250EX with out issue.
B00G18CZN0|5|good price and product.
B00ARJP34W|5|Great price and running well. Got rid of my misfire!
B00KZPN6UQ|5|I went with smaller tires on my car. It threw the speedometer off enough to where I didn't always want to do math. I bought this. Installation was this simple...<br />1. Unbox everything.<br />2. Toss the pad on the dashboard.<br />3. Toss the unit on the pad.<br />4. Plug it into the cigarette lighter, and choose mph or kph.<br />5. Use soapy water and a credit card (as a squeegee) to install reflective tape.<br />6. Drive, and always know your speed.<br /><br />Good product. I'm happy.
B001P11SCM|5|This was a really easy install in my 2000 Ford F250 Super Duty with a factory 7 pin plug. It had wiring already in place under the dash, I plugged in the harness 3035-P into each side and I was done with the install inside the truck once I screwed the mounting bracket in place with the provided screws. The trailer brake didn't light up, so I had to keep looking. What I found was that it is a common issue that these trucks didn't come with the fuses and relays needed to make the 7 pin plug work properly. I found I needed to install a 30 amp 'maxi fuse' under the hood. It was fuse number 28, this powered the trailer brake control circuit. Add maxi fuse #16 (30 amp) for the trailer charging circuit. Then there are two relays that need to be added. They were in a small black box next to the master cylinder, I popped the cover off and there were no relays in there. Those are for the charging circuit and backup lights circuit I believe. Hope this helps someone.
B001GF7MJA|4|What I like:<br /><br />1) inexpensive compared to accordion style.<br />2) does it's job well.<br />3) the custom fit is nice, though being of the roll up variety, it tends to bow in the middle a bit, but this hasn't dampened its ability to keep the heat to a minimum.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br /><br />1) rolling it up is a bit of a pain.  not sure if the folding kind would have been a better choice, but it was cheaper, so there's a price for less money.<br />2) the cut out around the rear view mirror could stand to be smaller to eliminate more sunlight.<br />3) bows in the middle a bit, but bit so much that it keeps it from functioning properly.
B001SG8Z1Q|1|I am in no way intending to bad mouth Dorman or Amazon with this review.  This plug did NOT fit my, completely stock, 2011 golf TDI.  Build quality seems pretty good, but the specs need to be checked.  If I had torgued this bolt down, I would have cracked the pan.<br /><br />Plug on the left is stock.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for the speedy refund.
B000C42QV0|5|How could I have possibly went wrong with the KYB brand AND the low price. Fastest shipping ever. Arrived 5 (yes..... five) days early. Unbelievable price,product and seller
B0089SLGIU|5|AAA+++ just as ordered!
B007KDL6J4|4|These worked great. I used them to put Newer Wrangler JK wheels on my Cherokee. The spacing puts the wheels just at the edge of the stock flares and the black coloring hides the fact they're on your jeep. The only thing I found disappointing was the lack of Rugged Ridge Stickers in the box.
B00EDORMWI|5|Love em, crisp white light with a slight hue of blue.
B00C7Y8LGW|5|Delivered quickly, worked great. Thank You
B00DQ9U2HS|5|Excellent product. Very well made and also very useful. I recommend this product to anyone looking for an item like this to buy. This is also a good company that shops very quickly to you...
B001DRH9MQ|4|Fit well parking brake works again
B00LEBLI82|1|Dim Dim Dim, not usable as a replacement for an RV interior bulb.
B0028JQZ5U|3|I loved this at first, but ended up returning it after dealing with that headrest.  The headrest doesn't add any comfort for me.. Just a bunch of drawbacks.. It hangs up/catches on things; it makes its own decisions; and it flops out/down when trying to store it vertically or horizontally on the garage wall..  Good in theory, but only degrades what would otherwise be a good creeper for the price.<br />P.S. Never get a plastic creeper or one with only 4 wheels.. Unless it's free on Craigslist and you weigh 70lbs or less.
B00P00U0BY|3|Good fit on my seats and good look
B007T12QPU|5|Ok
B000BUU5YU|5|Needed it for our new site. 50' of cord just wasn't enough.
B00HQP3PP4|2|First off, this is for a GLA45 AMG (was told it is the same fitment).  There is a problem in the design.  The heavy metal plate holder is designed to sit towards the left.  The weight of the plate holder caused the tow hook post to unscrew every time (turning it to the left).  There is no possibility to seat the plate holder to the right, due to CravenSpeed's design.<br />I solved the problem by going to my local auto parts store and buying a $4.95 plastic plate holder.  I drilled a hole in the left center of the plastic plate holder for CravenSpeed's tow hook post bolt.  Worked perfectly on my GLA 45's 2400 mile trip where the front plate was necessary.  Basically, I paid $79 for the tow hook post and bolt.<br />CravenSpeed could easily solve the design problem by doing exactly what I did - include a plastic license plate holder - and lower the price to the consumer.  I contacted CravenSpeed about the design flaw and sent photos.  Two weeks later, I have not received a response.
B00QXYUJBW|5|Makes changing those 15qts a breeze. Don't know why I waited so long to install. Works great.
B007Y87B2G|5|4 months after I installed this and it is still running strong. Better than the crappy AutoZone or Advance Auto ones. My car is a Mazda Tribute and it takes about 3 hours to change the alternator, which is ridiculous, so for me it is important to get one that will last.
B000C427K0|5|Not sure how much of a review I can really post.. Have been using on my 96 Skyline, the wrench off feature is awesome. Never had an issue, will continue to purchase this filter.
B001JT5CFY|4|very good quality. The grip handle is just a bit too large for my wife's hand.
B001Y8XS6U|5|Fit and look great on '98 Intrepid, bringing new life to the car. People only break the hubcaps by trying to make them too tight in fear they will pop off. On my steel rims I left two wire sections inside the plastic tab and it still popped in with a satisfying thud. Definitely recommend, especially for the price.
B00H9S71LW|5|Great product!
B00K9Z3LNY|5|Awesome solution, love it.
B003M2EPV8|5|Great product
B00MXGROV2|5|Received in perfect condition in less than 3 days and free shipping!  They look great on my 2014 4Runner SR5.  Easy install in less than 30 minutes.
B008OY88IU|4|Just what my bike needed looks good
B00COYNZJ8|5|gift for great-neice
B00BFG2NU8|4|Included more then what was indicated!
B00BGZ3QAY|4|It's nice pretty cheap as far as the price goes,it catches a lot of lint. It fits nice and snug and it arrived on time.
B00A1A6PT4|5|Excellent product to upgrade an inferior OEM part. Install took less than an hour, luckily none of the bolts holding the tensioner were frozen. Be sure you get all the old one out of there before install! The OEM elbows broke off inside, and I pulled two large pieces out and then I was able to fit these in place. HOWEVER, the bolts wouldn't line up correctly so I thought this product was incorrect. When I checked again, sure enough there was another 1/8&#34; or so of broken OEM pipe inside the housing still which was getting in my way! Once I took that out this fit perfectly!
B000WMCJPK|5|Easy to install.  Matches perfectly with my old one.
B00VWNRBQ0|5|Excelent
B006W25ZAU|1|Bad product I believe it to be wired wrong or internally shorted  the  wire colors don't match the lights don't turn on in the proper order I would not recommend us
B001VSJFM4|5|very good
B00U6NUNL2|5|Just what I wanted! Touch up paint doesn't always turn out the way you want.  So, I covered all my door edges not only to protect my car but others too.  Accidents happen this product mitigates the damage!
B00537LD1A|4|I found that these bend more than I needed for 3M car bra removal. I preferred the orange ones.  Good for their niche I'm sure.
B00EYBXV4I|5|Worked great for me. All the right joints in a kit. However, it doesnt include one front driveshaft  Ujoint and the ball centering kit. But thats all good with me!
B002669U3O|5|Super awesome!
B004MUI7OA|1|Doesn't fit to my 2007 Camry.
B000ZLSF74|5|Works great! I use it on the windows and siding on my house and highly recommend it!
B002MQCY7C|5|Just installed - that went as instruction no issues. It is a little small for my hands, but will see after some getting use to, how easy it is to clasp, unclasp is no sweat finding opening for male part will take some practice, so many years of threading strap thru D rings.<br />Quality is good
B001KVW6EQ|1|Didn't fit seat belts on American Airlines or Southwest - totally useless
B00IOREE94|5|Fits and works
B00026Z3E0|5|Love it.  Using it to hold up my trailer for my boat.
B007U6IBGW|5|So far, very good. Looks great from the front. From behind, its a bit &#34;old fashioned undergarment) looking. My neighbor was like...&#34;hey 🙋 your car is wearing underwear.&#34; So, if your neighbor is not a d*ck, this shouldn't be a problem. Snug fit. Easy to put in and take off. Stayed on during some major winds. The cord used to tighten the cover back at the trunk is way long. Why? The lines that is used to tie the cover to the door handles are totally important, but almost not long enough.<br /><br />Overall, an excellent buy. Perfect cause I thought it was plain stupid to spend hundreds on an &#34;official&#34; cover. Here to not being stupid!
B006IKGOUQ|5|Theyre pretty dark, i mainly needed goggles for the early ride to work and found it very difficult to see so definetly not for sun down but they fit great over my perscription glasses and fit inside my helmet with no problem at all
B00V2XHMBY|5|They work great! Love them and very bright.
B012DG24G6|5|Excellent, all the way around!
B004BGN0L0|5|Awesome!  In the past I've purchased a similar product from a competitor.  I decided to try this product because they offer it at a retail level in the 1 gallon size.  I extremely clean car, so I am apt to use a cleaner like this one almost daily!  So before I committed to whole gallon of this wonderful product. I tried this size first.  I will be buying a gallon of it very soon.<br /><br />Like it's competitor's product.  I would not recommend you use this on a super dirty car.  It works much better if the car is moderately dirty.  Heavy mud, grime or grease should be washed with a good and safe soap and water first.<br /><br />Also, you don't need a lot of the product to go over car that has been rained on and spotted.  If you note the amount of product missing on the pic from the nozzle to grip area of the bottle.  That's how much I used when I used it on my Mustang GT. I also recommend you shake the bottle.  It seems to activate it even more.<br /><br />I was completely blown away the results when applying this product to glass and plastic!  No film left behind, streak free clean.  Even feels smooth to the touch.  Unlike it's competitor's product which is a chore to get a clear window.
B00D4OOU7S|1|did not fit as they said they would
B00EA0ZB7I|5|These are awesome lights. Work perfectly for what I need. And the price is unbeatable!!
B00JIVLAR4|5|Replace old one with no problem
B009DJMQO2|4|very good
B00HR0BK1E|3|Not my first hoodflector, but I must say it was a very easy install; holes and screws lined up perfect. BUT I don't like how it sits on top of the hood and the sticky tape adheres directly to the plastic chrome and body paint. Previous vehicles this wrapped around the hoods front edge, protecting that. Also it is not low profile as it sits an inch above the entire hood line. If I had seen good pictures of this before I probably would have bought something else. BUT, its on and I don't want to peel it off my paint and chrome (that could be worse!!) -AVS got lazy with this design.
B000143LHY|5|Works great for smoke!
B007KCZ9B6|5|Look like new now. They fit just as the originals did. I've had them for about three months now the old ones faded after about ten years.
B00ZPB3D3K|5|Just what I ordered and what I needed.
B001JDE6ZW|5|You get what you pay for here.  They are not super stable, but serve the purpose
B00120KDGI|5|Good quality, fast shipping, great price!
B00U0NF7SC|5|Fast shipping.. Just as advertised
B000C9DPDS|5|Great replacement, but returned as my others just needed adjustment.
B000C0Y9FA|4|The replacement unit works well so far. I had to modify the cable support bracket to fit because the housing was shaped slightly different from the original. I was glad I watched youtube videos showing how to install this because of the need to push out a wire from the old connector and insert it into this new connector. Other than that a pretty easy replacement.
B003WHBVDI|2|what i received is not what is pictured... what i got was a straight spout, the one in the photo is curved... as far as design, portable is a good idea but for the price..eh...  it needs a handle for one-handed pouring and should come with instructions or diagram for assembly and use
B008923LSO|5|Great
B00XM6VSFA|1|Didn't fit, now I have to return it, dissappointed!!!
B005JC5BIA|5|Had them wielded to the backhoe front and back for when using chains.  What I was looking for.
B00B3YMJCE|5|Well designed bag that offers plenty of storage, ease of use, and style.<br /><br />Attaches easily and securely to your sissy bar and you're off and running with the storage you need. multiple compartments make it easy to store and get to what you need.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B004X2B9LA|5|gmc acadia. works good.
B00XXO870K|2|would not fit over a stack of four 225/60/17.  The description is misleading as I thought it meant the hide would cover up to 25&#34; inside diameter tires.  It is commonly understood when you say it fits over 25&#34; tires that refers to the inside diameter of the tire.
B00FOOV40W|5|Worked fine until it melted just like the original. Must have another problem in the circuit
B000CJ428K|1|The product picture is misleading. You don't get right angle grease fittings and they don't mount on the center as shown. But the real problem is that the grease fittings are necessary because the rubber shaft seals are crap. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU BUY AN OEM UNIT WITHOUT GREASE FITTINGS. No matter which you buy you will REALLY need a ratcheting box wrench or the install will take forever (at 1/8 of a turn each time). This Moog unit has a 15 mm nut. I will return next year (if I fail inspection for this part again) and let you know if this part is holding up. I installed this part mostly because I didn't want to go through the hassle of a return.<br />Eric Hammel
B000CQPQ06|2|90/no perfect
B00493UPL8|5|Part fit just right, great price and delivery.<br />Thanks AC Delco
B00898LAJ0|5|Very satisfied with this mirror.  It fits snug, no noticeable vibration, clear image, and looks good.
B000GU0YFK|4|They were a good addition to my motorcycle.
B00GSAUHB8|5|The transaction went off perfectly.  I'm very pleased.
B011UCNZB2|4|Fits my CRV 08 AC Sanden compressor. the ac lines. Look up the honda forum and there was somebody who replaced his magnetic clutch .
B00HRXTZ36|4|Extremely difficult to install.  But once on, they look great!  Takes a lot of fussing and experimentation to get them to go on properly.  It's remarkable how well these two pedal covers really finish the appearance of the Touareg.
B004AIOZFO|4|5 star if not for the nut thing (big thanks to the other reviewers).  Worked great for 2007 ford escape.  Boo the the bad reviews from people who had 2008 vehicles.
B00O5EIQ12|5|Exactly as advertised.
B0009IBJE4|5|Received on a timely basis and the charger works as advertised.
B000E7UIWO|4|A nice assortment of bungee cords with solid hooks and good amount of stretch. So far... Very good.
B007W45QA6|5|Fit great and went on faster than the removal of the old system.  My truck does 'breath' much better now - Thank You
B000ND0WB6|5|good
B000FQ21R4|2|WEAK RUBBER
B0052FRYOS|4|Good
B003NU0EM8|1|The suction cup detached from the handle the second time I tried to use it. It cannot be reattached.
B00OLYE7JG|2|I ordered these and was expecting a higher quality product than what I received.  The two sets of stickers were two different colors.  It looked as though one set had faded and the other set was the original color.  Very disappointed.
B00DTDH00S|3|Great exhaust system, but what I received was not what was pictured in the illustration.  What I got was indeed Cobra's PowerPro 2 into 1 pipes, but after the install I noticed the whole exhaust assembly was much shorter than what was pictured.  The end of the muffler is approximately 2 inches short of reaching the rear axle, and the header pipes are routed a little differently, and that's why I give this product 3 stars instead of 5, I like how the pipes in the picture look more than what I have on my Super Glide.  The exhaust note is deep and much louder than what the stock pipes put out, you know it's a Harley just by the sound, music to my ears.  The fit and finish (chrome) is first rate, the instructions on how to do the install was easy to follow... typical Cobra quality.
B004A6LUNG|5|just do not over tighten this filter 3/4 turn from contact up to 1 turn.
B008IK7TSA|5|Needed a little adjustment but worked great!
B00LNL3CGO|5|Worked perfect
B003NWR1J0|5|WORKS GREAT, LARGE 2&#34;
B0002SRL20|5|Finally broke down and bought a good one to replace the three Chinese ones that are broken couldn't be happier .
B00EEG8RGA|2|Good but it coast me more for shipment
B0016LE80K|5|Does what it says.  Heavy duty.  Confident it will stand the test of time.
B004QJSL34|5|Excellent Product ! !
B00VQ3MUEY|5|The switch works great but the built in blue LED's look a little cheap.
B001TZ4I76|5|Honestly the best rear bench seat cover I have found. I love that I can still use the function of the rear seat as it folds out and down and I don't have to move the cover. Looks awesome too!!
B003JSLWWA|5|I have 4 batteries in my boat. one staring battery and three deep cell batteries. Two of the deep cell batteries are set up in 24 volts. I did not have the room to mount the gen4 on my boat and did not want to use alligator clips on the batteries so purchased 4 @10 foot long Noco quick disconnect cables, cut both ends and attached 1 end to each battery and the other to the gen4. there is a rubber boot on one end and that is the end that I attached to the battery that makes it water proof when not charging. Now I have 4 quick disconnects. By the way all the batteries are all ways charged perfectly and all ways ready for the next days fishing. one more thing my charger is plugged into a 15 amp outlet, don't ask me how it can do that, but I guess that it why they call it the&#34;GENIUS&#34; this is one very happy customer.
B000Z0HVHA|4|I have an outlet in the third row, but not the second.  As I wanted a &#34;permanent&#34; solution to run a line to the front seat area, this is great.  I don't think it would last forever if someone wanted to plug/unplug it daily.  Also, If the male end was bit shorter or did a 90, it would be less obtrusive.
B00CGGXRK6|5|Looks good.  Took about 10 minutes to put on.
B00PT18QAQ|5|Very nice and comfortable to use.
B006U88YCW|5|Excellent item.
B00J6ZI4JE|5|Installed on a 2015 toyota rav4 le very easily. You may have to remove a small plastic beauty plate covering the tiedown that has to be removed prior to install. The fit and finish was just okay. Some dings and a few imperfections on the surface of the hitch but it is a hitch....box was in perfect condition on arrival. Would buy again!
B00PT18QAQ|5|Perfect.  Very fast delivery.
B0041DODDC|5|Works great for the oil filter housing on cars. I had one before but somehow it got lost. This is a great replacement.
B000VNAIQ2|5|Gd product / shipping by pony express
B0002JMIEK|5|Nice wax to use goes on so smooth and wipes off very easy to a sparkling shine !!! very happy with purchase !!!
B001OBHACK|5|Make sure you order left and right model numbers. Works great on 95 wrangler 2.5L notice difference in stopping power. Everything you need for swap.
B004HGTXUQ|4|Everything needed in one package .No need to chase around finding all the pieces.<br />Good delivery time.
B0013RIOMK|5|Got this my birthday and it is awesome. Snapped right in like it's always been there and it makes my front of the jeep look completely different.
B000AMBNPY|4|This product is quite thin, but it does help with the bright and hot California sun. Just wished they are able to make these screens covers the corners of windows better and may be a little larger in size too. But this is a product I depend on all year, but especially in the summer.
B00KTIW9AC|5|Took the guts out of the old shells put'em into the new shells, now they work like brand new.
B002CMOUBO|5|Good
B0040M4LRC|5|Very good price and cool
B00KTICEZ2|5|Thanks, works great!
B00EPDKURG|1|I was excited to get my new seat covers. I had them on my seats for exactly one week and one day and they began to tear along the seam that connect the back to the seat. Very disappointed!!! Returned for a refund. Will see how this works out...
B000G6M3VC|5|Strange review.  I just purchased one of these, and I purchased it because it's the exact same one that I'm replacing my old one with.  I purchased the old one 20 years ago and it's seen one heck of a lot of use till today when it went out, probably because the battery finally went. I check my tires once a week or so on two vehicles, one that has tires that leak, so it got a  lot of use.  So, I'll check back in 2035 and let you know if it goes before that!  I'm happy its still around because I don't want to have to adjust to another shaped gauge!  I do keep it in the house where it's not subjected to heat.
B003RYOWH8|4|The video instruction definitely helped. The 2 front seat covers fit my 2015 Camry like a dream.
B000C2Q1V8|5|Thought A/c was going out. Discovered the fan was bad. Now is like new again. Ice cold
B00SLKTXAY|5|Fit just as the factory hose.
B000ARPVNO|4|Amazingly this stuff actually worked. I've had a consistent leak. One bottle of this and I haven't lost any fluid in months.
B00KTHZMPM|5|Great!<br /><br />Works like a charm. No issues.<br /><br />The only thing is one of my 2 keys has buttons that are easier to push. The other I'm having to use my fingernail to engage them....but no biggie, bc the store I got them cut at totally demolished said key.
B000CCMLD0|4|A little high on price.
B00MQU88J2|4|I had a brake light on the roof of my van go out. Was just a strip of lights inside the plastic housing. Can you just buy the lights from General Motors? Of course not. You have to buy the $265.00 complete unit. Wrong. I bought these and 1 strip was perfect . Fit great. Price even better. The leads are 11&#34; long where I saw someone asking. These lights are really also. Good Deal.
B0050SFVO2|5|Reliable
B0013FY1YM|5|Works perfect and looks just like the original part.
B008F9FBSE|4|Awesome
B000AMBNRC|5|great
B007G2IN04|3|On the whole a very nicely-done product from billet aluminum, but marred by one silly and avoidable defect: one of my thumbscrews fell off onto the driveway before the thing had even seen the water.  Kuuma really should use circlips or spring washers to retain those thumbscrews instead of just flimsy split washers.  Mill away a bit of the thumbscrews' thread near the plastic base, pop on a circlip and presto!  No more silly defect marring an otherwise fine design.
B00YMN5M3G|4|Works really well.  Just wish you could talk to multiple people at same time.
B00OW0NQGE|5|Nice key chain. Looks good. No problems with it so far. Leather is really stiff but maybe needs breaking in. Comes with two additional rings.
B00UKIUJ12|5|It's a great sticker
B006H34AE6|5|This brush is amazing. Other reviewers had said so much, but you don't really understand how good this brush is until you use it. I had to lay down carpet stair treads so my fur machine of a border collie could climb the stairs without sliding after he had back surgery. Those carpet treads attract fur like a magnet, and I use this brush to get rid of it. Even when you don't think there's much there, this brush manages to pull out whatever lurks between fabric fibers. It's fantastic on upholstery (chairs, couch, car seats) as well as on rugs and carpets.
B00OV7HKA6|1|Wouldn't even charge my iPad!
B00JIME8QS|1|The key could not be cut correctly by 4 different independent locksmiths in Boston.  The very last locksmith claimed that the key is out of spec.  He copied my original key using his blank on the spot and that key worked fine and gave it to me for free.

B003WOZOUM|5|Good size for a mid-size station wagon.  The strapping is a little befuddling, but once figured out it was solid.

B009VOQ05U|4|How to install for new Toyota Tacomas<br /><br />Good solid rack...great deal for $100<br /><br />For toyota Tacomas, you can not use the hardware included because you do not have access inside & under the bed rails. What I used was 1/2 zinc lag screws that were 2&#34; long along with 2 washers for each screw.  Mark your holes on the plastic cap liner on the bed rail and predrill your holes with a 5/16 drill bit. Remove the plastic rail cap first so that you can see where you are drilling....you want to drill thru the metal to create a smaller hole for the lag screw to go in. Once the holes are drilled, set up your rack and screw in your lag screws with 2-3 washers.  I hand screwed mine in slowly with a ratchet. Do not overtighten the screws or you will break the metal hole that you punched thru when predrilling.<br /><br />I also used a reciprocal saw to cut the H cross bat down 2 1/4 inches in order to decrease the rack height.  Flip the cross bar upside down and pop out the end caps to cut off some height.  USE THIS END TO SLIDE DOWN ON THE MALE END and you can decrease the rack height a little more. Replace the plastic caps on the opposite end.<br /><br />Good luck!
B00NWF5RUI|5|Excellent product! Original GM packaging.<br /><br /> To pair with vehicle.<br /> Hold the unlock switch down on the drivers door. While turning your ignition on and off two times. Let go of unlock switch on door. Hold the unlock and lock buttons on your remote down simultaneously for approximately 15 seconds. Door locks will lock and unlock. Let go of unlock and lock switch on the remote. If you have more than one remote all remotes must be done during this time . Once all remotes have been done, turn ignition switch on and off. Process is complete.

B001DCH2FK|3|Squeak in reverse, therefore I cannot validate noiseless statement as they are not. Two professionals validated they were put on correctly.
B00GV8UVNQ|5|Quick ship. Attached easily. Perfect!
B0022XXEOC|3|A great idea and once you have it installed properly it works great. On my Suzuki Boulevard it took a little work. First remove the throttle and cut 1/4&#34; off the handle bars.

B000C9191I|5|I replaced the muffler and tailpipes a few years ago on my 1990 Chevy K2500 350 pickup with extended cab (141.5” wheelbase) and this was a perfect fit. As another viewer stated the pic is wrong and this muffler has a 3” inlet with two 2-1/4” outlets and I’d also suggest using the Walker site to get the correct part number and then shop around for the best price. I had to replace my engine because it was burning oil so I also replaced the crossover pipe, converter and had to add an extension pipe because the new converter was shorter than the one it replaced. All were Walker pipes (or Dynomax which is also Walker) and all fit perfectly. I now have to replace the muffler again because it’s filled with soot from the oil but I used a compression clamp and it bent the intermediate pipe in the muffler inlet so much I had to cut it off at the muffler and add a short extension so don’t use compression clamps if you think you’ll ever need to get it apart later… I went with the stainless lap preformed clamps the go over the pipes… like the SmartParts 300300 & 320300.
B007WR25KW|5|They work great. Easy and quick!
B006EHHNPI|5|After a lot of looking around, landed on this to cure the knocking sound in my friends' 2005 Five Hundred with dual zone auto climate control.<br /><br />Their car had a knocking sound coming from behind the passenger side dash.  This particular sound would happen for 5-10 seconds after turning the car on.  Some youtube videos show a culprit motor just off to the left of center if you're looking behind the glove box.  In my case, the motor was off to the right of center on the ductwork behind the glove box.<br /><br />The original part was stamped 5F93-19E616.  This new part was stamped 8F93-19E616-AA.  The box this new part came in... wait for it... yet another number:  8F9Z-19E616-A, along with the YH-1880.<br /><br />When I opened up the old part, found the failure mode to be stripped teeth on several of the gears.<br /><br />Bottom line, this does a great job fixing the banging sound.  This does not require pulling any fuses or anything to install.  Took about 4 minutes, a flashlight and an 8mm socket and ratchet.
B004W4OOKW|1|Looks nice but low light output and kept shorting out the computer error code short to ground. SPYDER support was worthless buyer beware!!
B000E4B7PY|5|On time and as described.
B007SOODHC|5|great quality product, good prices & fast delivery...
B005FY9HVE|3|this set is ok , but youll need to go to a supply store and replace the Plastic seals on the end of hoses, with rubber , cause they otherwise will leak
B008G1WEWC|5|They worked and fit perfectly and cam with new reflectors, seals and screws.  For the money I couldn't be happier!
