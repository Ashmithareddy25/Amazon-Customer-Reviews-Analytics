B00DR0PDNE|5|This is truly plug and play.  I got the book to unlock the untapped and found that i didn't need it.  However, it wasn't a waste.  I use the Chromecast exclusively for Netflix and link off my phone and it works like a charm.
B00AN0KGWE|5|Such a great show. The writing is phenomenal. I will warn you it's got a lot of language, gratuitous nudity, a some of the most graphic violence I've seen in film lol. None of which bothers me, but for as much medias as I've consumed over the years, I was still somehow surprised at the levels of all of it. There'll be scenes with important dialogue, meanwhile the supporting cast will be moaning so loud I begin to wonder what my neighbors think I'm watching lol. But you can't turn it down b/c of the conversation...oh well.<br /><br />The costume design, dialogue, and world they've created are spectacular. I don't usually do this but I even watched the special behind the scenes stuff after I finished the season (spoilers). They really go all out to immerse you in the world. Which...isn't completely based on reality, but borrows a lot from real cultures then mixes in a bit of magic. But not enough to call it a fantasy. It never feels like the main focus of the show, but it's definitely a strong undercurrent.<br /><br />Season two was *slightly* worse than the first. The dynamics of the show shift compared to season one and I just favor the other. But I'm sure it'll change again in the next season. Still 5 stars.
B008LA7RM0|5|can anyone dispute the fact that this is one of the best albums in all of rock and roll history? no they cannot, can they dispute the fact that it is better than sergeant peppers, yes they can...have at it music people ;)
B00BCOQSSQ|3|The tools are there for this to be a great series.  Huff's imagination was wonderful and really set things up for the following books which is where the meat of the series will probably take place.  I would think that the book may have needed more length to get more character interaction, but the as I said, the tools are there to develop a fantastic series.
B0000025F7|5|Originally written November 2008: As a tribute to Michael Jackson, I only wish that [Michael Jackson,] Epic/Sony would release this album with the original artwork featuring Michael Jackson's face [(when he was black and before his nose surgeries)] and his nice afro. I fortunately bought this CD in 1991 which featured the original artwork of a handsome young man and may he rest in peace. [It is just a shame what has happened to his appearance.]

B00003CXI1|5|I read all of the Harry Potter books and enjoyed them all emmensely. I was very scared that the movie wouldn't be able to live up to The Sorcerer's Stone, so I was skeptical about going to see it....<BR>But, finally I caved, and I am so glad that I did because the movie was just as enchanting as the book itself...  <BR>It was so true to the book I couldn't believe it... <BR>Such a great movie...

B000ICLHIE|5|If Sam Cooke has the most beautiful singing voice of all time, Tom Waits has the grittiest.  In a strange way, this comparison is not out of the question.  I have always felt that it was impossible to accurately capture Cooke's voice and do it justice.  It transcends modern recording.  Wait's voice is the same way. You should earmark $100, buy this album, a Sam Cooke album, and donate the rest to a New Orleans charity.  It will make a difference in your life.
B00005JKCH|4|SPIDER-MAN was the the #1 film of 2002; it was a blockbuster liked by critics and loved by audiences (especially kids). But after repeated viewings, the movie becomes a bit stale for me after awhile.<br />The film's good points though are Tobey Maguire's solid potrayal of Peter Parker/Spider-Man and Kirsten Dunst as the lovely MJ. The bad points were the wearisome Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe was good though) and the pathetic dialogue this film has, especially by the villian. It was a bit long as well.<br />I'm giving it four stars though because of the way it looked like when I first saw it. It was fun, somewhat exciting, and the performances were grand. And also because I like Sam Raimi, the director, because he made a favorite movie of mine before. It was DARKMAN. It was way better then SPIDER-MAN, but Raimi did a good job at building a comic-book atmosphere for this movie.<br />Every kid in this world has flocked around this movie, which is a bit annoying for me. It's not better then the more plausible X-MEN 2, but it was good enough for a viewing.
B0059XTV4Y|2|Just rented this.. I have to say it is one of the most disappointing movies I have seen. The love story itself would have been great, it is a beautiful story in real life but.... it got lost in a mess... I'm still not sure what the point of the second plot line was or why it was relevant to the story... I feel like I wasted 2 hours of my life watching it and another 5 minutes writing this review. To end on a positive note, the costumes and stylization of the movie was beautiful.
B00IKZX1ZI|3|Over done.
B00BATINVS|5|This is an interesting, quick read on retraining your brain and the way you think. Helpful but not earth shattering. I can't wait to read their other books.
B0097HSS4M|4|Now I'm not saying this is photoshop bit seriously there's some good features in this app. Mostly socialesque coloring and stuff but blemish remover and a few others like brightness and color fix work rather well. I come from a heavy adobe background and I think this little apps &amp;#34;auto&amp;#34; fix works better than adobe's does. Well worth the money. Buy it!
B0050SYS5A|1|Doesn't work properly.  The second you put this on your kinect, it wont be able to track you and wont be precise enough to play any games any more.  I can't believe a company can get away with marketing something like this.

B0054JZC6E|5|it works really well it is super fun and perfect for kids=):) it has no blood or groosom parts I love it
B0048KXRR6|5|My kids absolutely love this movie!  Just as good as the first one was!  Hope they do part three soon!
B0058Z4NR8|4|The author lays out his thesis in the first chapter.  Then the remainder of the book is providing examples of one nation after another and explaining what initially appears to be exceptions.  This is a comprehensive and well written book.
B0094K1WZE|5|Plenty of well thought out and executed action.  Leaves one wanting at least one more mission wherein Tom Cruise and his wife are reunited (but only after some impossible obstacles are faced and alleviated.
B000002KO1|5|I first heard &quot;Brass in Pocket&quot; right around the beginning of 1980.  I thought to myself - 'man, the 80s are gonna be great when it comes to musics'.  I immediately went out and bought the Pretenders debut album.<br />The irony became that &quot;Brass in Pocket&quot; is possibly the weakest song on the recording (though I have little use for &quot;Space Invaders&quot;).<br />&quot;Precious&quot; and &quot;Mystery Achievement&quot; are possibly the best opening and closing numbers on a record ever.  Sandwiched inbetween are some wonderful, underrated recordings that rarely got played.  &quot;Lovers of Today&quot; and &quot;Private Life&quot; are much more subtle than &quot;Tattooed Love Boys&quot;, but it works.  And the almost pop of &quot;Stop Your Sobbing&quot; and &quot;Kid&quot; really fit in nicely without becoming sell-out material.<br />Everything else is just as good - though as mentioned, &quot;Brass in Pocket&quot; may have become too overplayed for me, but that's just quibbeling on my part.<br />The Pretenders have put out a lot of other good work (their 2nd and 3rd albums), but it does pain me to say - they've never matched the accomplishments of their debut disk.
B007G5O3K0|5|I was an A-Ha fan back in the eighties and just recently found them again when I saw Morten Harket on the Billboard Music Awards performing with Pitbull and Christina Aguilera.  Not only had he not aged a bit in almost 30 years but it made me revisit my love of A-Ha.  He has the most amazing voice with a vocal range that cannot be matched.  While A-ha disbanded in 2010 I was thrilled to find that were solo projects out there.You are in pure heaven listening to this cd.  I don't know how America let him slip thru their fingers all these years.  This talent while appreciated abroad should have had more! I would recommend this to anyone who loves a true vocal gift from the heavens as this is surely where Morten Harket came from. Pure genius!
B00FCAJZEK|5|Maybe the most interesting of the solo concerts from that period; covers a range of feelings/tones, from dark to exuberant. A master at work. I am surprised, though, that he didn't yell at the audience for applauding while the compositions were being played. I understand he was prone to audible annoyance when someone coughed or sneezed or whispered. Not here, though. He seems to be feeding off the audience's appreciation.
B003L77GH4|5|Very good and exciting. Couldn't wait to see the next dvd. A little scary at times. As well as comical. Highly recomend this season.
B00GCE3TCE|4|This is a very compelliing book.  You have to realize that it is death writing the book.  I enjoyed the book and the movie goes along with the book very good.
B005FLX1HS|5|awesome music
B008JGSM6G|5|Addicted.
B00005Q45W|4|This new disc is fine. I don't mind the backing vocalist, she has a very good smoothe voice. The backing arrangements are spartan but they work nonetheless. Leonard doesn't really sing per se, he sort of narrates or 'talk sings', this is fine too.<BR>He has a cool sounding voice. Why nothing really bowled me over on this disc, I do have a couple of favourites: A Thousand Kisses Deep, Here It Is and By The Rivers Dark. Sound quality is very good. You either like his style or you don't, I like it but I doubt I'd buy his whole catlog.
020530902X|5|Twenty-one years ago, a professor in one of my English Lit. classes brought out a book that was NOT one of those texts that you thought you were going to have to take along into the next life in order to finish it. The book was quite the opposite. It was a small 78 page publication that was no more intimidating than a comic book. <br />I was a student that needed help in my punctuation, word usage, and style. I hoped, as did all the students, that the day would come when we would be published. The professor said, &quot;If you're ever going to make it in the writing field, this book will be your best guide. Stick to the principles mentioned in its pages and you will achieve your goals. That is, assuming you have any writing ability in you at all.&quot; <br />Currently, I am taking a refresher course through a correspondence school back East. Guess what book is part of their curriculum? You're right, it's The Elements of Style. This time I have given the book a strict credence, and in the next few months I will have my first publishing credit.<br />I believe, The Elements of Style, is still the best book on correct writing techniques there is on the market. It was so tweny-one years ago and it will be so twenty-one years from now.<br />M.D. Cummings

B001NLKWLW|5|This story was beautifully written and was able to hold my interest throughout. I loved the way Kate Morton moved from past to present and back again. It was a little difficult to keep track of the story line at first but the book was totally engrossing. A great read!
0395645662|5|Even though I read it a long time ago.It touched me deeply.It pointed out the views of life.And showed how harsh life can be.My opinion may not count but you should read this book.

B000T9OP7G|1|only got one disc. was really looking forward to watching it right now. i open it and see that only disc 3 is in there and disc 1&2 is no where to be found. that is not fair. where are the other 2 at?
B00005JLXE|2|Another Marvel Comics character makes it to the screen. DAREDEVIL is co-produced by creator Stan Lee, which raises the viewer's expectations. This isn't the first movie to feature the character: Daredevil was previously played by Rex Smith (from the short lived TV series STREET HAWK) in the 1991 TVM, TRIAL OF THE INCREDIBLE HULK.<BR>Ben Affleck plays Ben Affleck, who is trying to play Matt Murdock: a lawyer, and former Hell's Kitchen resident blinded at age 12 by toxic waste (that happens to fall off a fork-lift) after witnessing  the death of his prize fighter father Jack \\"The Devil\\" Murdock (David Keith) at the hands of thugs (phew!).<BR>As always happens in comic books, this toxic waste may have deprived Matt of his sight; but has heightened his four remaining senses. So of course Matt does what has to be done: He dons a silly costume and becomes a vigilante fighting for the rights of the little people and keeping the city safe from crime. <BR>But Matt/Daredevil appears to have met his match when he crosses paths with Wilson Fisk, a.k.a crime boss The Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan, who gained 18kgs for the role) and his henchman, Bullseye (A shaven headed Colin Farrell with a bullseye tattooed on his forehead, hence the name).<BR>However, Daredevil gains an ally in the karate kicking superbabe Elektra Nachios (ALIAS's Jennifer Garner), daughter of multi-millionaire Nicholas Nachios and together they join forces to try and topple the Kingpin (After she nearly beats the heck out of him, in an admittedly good fight scene). But tailing Matt is tabloid newsman Ben Urich (Joe Pantoliano) who is trying to uncover the truth about the urban legend of Daredevil. A weak attempt at adding a subplot.<BR>DAREDEVIL steals elements of BATMAN & THE HULK TV show; and when you combine this with a cliched script and a wooden lead, it all adds up to 100+ minutes of wannabe- hip; two- dimensional Hollywood drivel.<BR>Good production design is one of DAREDEVIL's few redeeming features; but the movies \\"Special Effects\\" include a camera tilt of Daredevil's feet splashing in a puddle! What a suspense builder! Even BLOOD FEAST (1963) had visuals superior to this!<BR>Also, check out this brilliant dialogue exchange when hero and villain finally meet face to face:<BR>Kingpin: \\"Daredevil!\\"<BR>Daredevil: \\"KINGPIN!!\\".<BR>Wow.<BR>DVD extras include both audio AND text commentaries by the producer and director, and an \\"Enhanced viewing mode\\" function with a Behind The Scenes featurette narrated by the Visual Effects Supervisor , as well as popup factoids you can watch during the movie. That is, if you're still interested. Bring on SPIDER-MAN 2, I say.
B00IWULSTC|5|Neil DeGrasse Tyson is the man! The concepts are late highschool science topics, but the history is great. Good for all ages and abilities.

B0045HCJQW|5|Love LOVE this movie.  Many stars Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewart, Katherine Hepburn and many others.  Have always wanted to own this.  Came in a timely manner.  Not scratchs, skips etc.
B004SBQAN8|5|fantastick
B00008K7AM|1|It's official! The days of 'Happy Gilmore' and 'Billy Madison' are over.  After seeing 'Little Nicky' a few years back, I prayed to the movie gods that it was just a fluke.  But after suffering through 104 minutes of school-age jokes and tired sexual inuendo, I have lost hope in seeing anything from these producers that doesn't insult my intelligence.  To be fair, some folks will like this movie.  Sadly, I'm not one of them.
B004LWZW4M|4|The movie was in great condition although the cover photo looked as if it might be a fake. All together this movie is one of my favorites and I am satisfied with the product.
B0049J3QF4|5|This is a great movie for kids and so easy to rent thru amazon.  My son loves to watch this and it is easy to rent on the computer and instantly watch it on our tv thru our xbox.
B00TU9UO1W|4|This is a pretty decent science fiction movie.  It is intriguing and a real though provoker.  I enjoyed it.  I like that it is a longer movie.  Mathew McConahey needs to stop mumbling though.  The movie shows both the strengths and weaknesses of humanity.  It also demonstrates that there is a lot more to the universe than we imagine.
B005ZOBNOI|4|Liked the main characters. Not a big fan of the VanHouten part of the storyline.  Well written, page Turner.  Would recommend
B003VVFGWC|5|Love it!! Very entertaining and the plot is very well written. Extremely surprised. Would recommend for everyone to see it.
B000NQRR1Q|4|Some films are about plot, some about characters, and some about the form, the journey you take.  This is definitely the latter.  Oh, the plot keeps us going, and the characters are all interesting though they never really move forward.  But the craft is there, and it makes this movie worth watching at least once.<br /><br />Depp is fine as the main character, an amoral \\"book detective\\".  Frank Langella is wonderful as the millionaire book collector who sets him on his journey.  And Emmanuelle Seigner is wonderful as \\"the girl\\" - the unnamed companion/protector who provides most of the movie's occult mystery.<br /><br />And plenty of mystery there is! I'll give a spoiler here: the ending is ambiguous.  A mystery is set up and you really never truly find out the solution.  However, it's so much fun getting to the unsatisfying ending that you may, as I was, feel rewarded by the journey.<br /><br />And herein lies my warning: please don't go into this thinking that it will be a horror-noir with a satisfying ending like Angel Heart or Lord of Illusions. This film is arguably more accomplished than either of those in terms of sheer craft.  However, it is slower, more deliberate, and WILL NOT ANSWER THE MYSTERY in an overt way as those films did.  But in a very good way it leaves you thinking about the non-answers and asking questions, which, for me at least, was a rewarding experience.<br /><br />There are flaws: the ambiguity is frustrating at the end. There is no way you can solve what happened given the clues in the actual movie itself (there are a few more clues in the original novel, but that shouldn't count, especially given the divergence of plot).  There are two mostly-boring car-chase scenes. Sometimes characters are a touch stilted, which wouldn't normally be a problem except that Depp is extremely naturalistic here, and the styles clash somewhat.<br /><br />But, quibbles aside, I'd recommend this film highly.  Not perfect, and not completely satisfying (nor meant to be!) but well worth the journey, even if you never really get to the end.
B0072GPQNG|2|We thought that this movie was a very Dark one.  We also thought that it was very long for the story it was trying to convey.  We are sorry that we spent the money on it.  We wish there was a way to return it.
0670024783|5|Sue is such a good storyteller.  I would read anything she writes
B0006GAO5Y|5|\\"Rocky\\" is about a man. It is the story of a man who exceeds past all normal expectations and makes the most out of what he is doing. What is he doing? Boxing. Why? As Rocky says in the film, \\"You have to be a moron to want to box.\\"<br /><br />Rocky is played by Sylvester Stallone, whose only other film before \\"Rocky\\" was \\"Weekend at Kitty and Stud's,\\" and, as you can probably guess by the title, it was an X-rated movie. But Stallone gives just about the best performance of his career here. Before he started getting into recycled action movies and unfunny comedies, the man had talent, as seen shining through in \\"Rocky.\\" Somewhere along the way he lost that talent, but it's pretty evident that he had it at one time.<br /><br />Stallone wrote the script, which is about a down-on-his-luck Philadelphia man named Rocky Balboa. Rocky is your average tough-guy you see walking down the street, but this film takes a closer look INTO the guy walking past you, and not AT the guy walking past you.<br /><br />He lives in a beat-up, old apartment, infested with roaches, and he barely makes enough money to support himself. His job? Rocky retrieves money for loan sharks. His real job, however, is to break the loaners' thumbs if they don't pay up. He's a muscle man.<br /><br />After he returns from his \\"job\\" every day, he takes time to do what he has been doing for the past six years, which is boxing. Then, after that, he takes a trip to the local pet store to see the love of his life, Adrian, who works there. He constantly tries to impress her and talk to her, but she is shy and literally does not talk much throughout the entire film.<br /><br />But things change for Rocky after heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) decides that he wants to make a big performance on the 4th of July. He wants to appear nice by letting a regular Joe Schmoe fight him in the ring. All for show, of course. As he is looking through a book of local boxers, he points his finger at the letters THE Italian STALLION, a.k.a. Rocky. He says that fighting an Italian is perfect. \\"An Italian found America,\\" Creed says. If he fights an Italian-American on the 4th of July, it will be symbolic and will also make Creed look good.<br /><br />But Rocky doesn't realize this is all for show. When he receives word that Apollo Creed wishes to fight him in the ring, Rocky begins to train long and hard with Burgess Meredith, which results in the famous scene where Rocky runs up an entry of stairs in Philly with the music \\"Gonna Fly Now\\" playing in the background. This scene is spoofed by films world-wide, and it's one of the cornerstones in film history. You will see it all the time. It's just one of those film moments that are marked down in history.<br /><br />The most entertaining thing about \\"Rocky\\" is how innocent Sylvester Stallone comes across in his role as Rocky. You feel for him when he is trying to impress Adrian and she shrugs him off. The scene where her brother invites Rocky over, and Rocky keeps saying, \\"Are you sure she knows I'm coming?\\" is a sign of how the guy has been put down. And then when she comes over to his apartment, he acts nice and talks to her. He's not trying any moves on her. He just enjoys being with her. Rocky is a bit of an idiot, as he himself admits, but he's a sweet idiot.<br /><br />And the end, when Rocky fights Apollo Creed, is amazing. A nobody who actually stands a chance against the heavyweight champion of the world. Creed and Rocky are being battered by each other. Creed goes into the opposite corner as Rocky, and one of Creed's managers says, \\"This guy thinks this thing is for real -- knock him out!\\" You feel sorry for Rocky there, because he is giving the fight all he's got, when it was just a publicity stunt from the beginning, but he didn't even realize it.<br /><br />Things like that are what make \\"Rocky\\" what it has become over the years. It is a great film, and it has many classic moments that you will see spoofed in filmsall the time. You should probably see it just for that fact.<br /><br />But the truth is, if you take away all the underlying intricacies, \\"Rocky\\" is just the story of a simple guy who gets a chance to do something amazing, and he gives it all he's got. I think we've all gone through something like that before, and if so, you will be able to identify with \\"Rocky\\" all the more.spoofed in films all the time.

B001TW69J4|5|This is the first AAL album I've heard (it was their first was well), and I'm totally blown away.  The compositions are amazing, the guitar sounds are really tasty, and the programmed drums are very convincing.  If you're a fan of progressive, guitar-driven instrumental music, I don't think you'll be disappointed in this record.
B0057KXR80|4|Well it was about time, since korn has been dropping albums every year.    I am liking the mix between old and new and you can definitley tell that Wes is back with the edge.    I will wait until the vinyl is available and then i will get the MP3 download.
B0000032LS|5|I first saw RHPS on December 12, 2002 when I bought it on VHS.  I've been a huge fan since then.  Not too long after, I bought the soundtrack, which I never seem to stop listening to.<br />Science Fiction/Double Feature-5 out of 5-A wonderful opening song.  It seems to tell you right away what this movie is: a spoof on all of the past Science Fiction movies.  Richard O'Brien is great singing this one. ;)<br />Dammit, Janet-5 out of 5-Great singing by Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon(B.B. and S.S. =P).<br />Over at the Frankenstein Place-5 out of 5-Great song.  I really love singing back-up and Riff-Raff's verse in this song.<br />Time Warp-5 out of 5-I love Patricia Quinn as Magenta.  I always sing her parts in this song.  Also, the dance is so much fun to do.<br />Sweet Transvestite-5 out of 5-Noone could ever pull off the role of Frank N. Furter like Tim Curry.  Tim has the look and the voice.<br />I Can Make You A Man-5 out of 5-Great song.  Tim really sounds great here.<br />Hot Patootie, Bless My Soul-5 out of 5-One of my favorites from this album.  Meatloaf, I believe was the best choice as Eddie.<br />I Can Make You A Man(reprise)-Great finish.  I really like Mendelssohn's wedding march re-done with a rock sound.<br />Touch-a Touch-a Touch Me-5 out of 5-Susan Sarandon is great as Janet.  This is a great song.<br />Eddie-5 out of 5-Jonathan Adams is great as Dr. Everett von Scott.  This is a great 60's style rock song.  Very fun to dance around and sing to.<br />The Floor Show-100 out of 5-The best song on the album!  My favorite part to it is &quot;Wild and Untamed Thing&quot;.<br />I'm Going Home-5 out of 5-The saddest song on the album.  I always get sad during this song in the movie because I know Frank's murder is coming up.  =(<br />Super Heroes-5 out of 5-It's sad because what Brad and Janet were singing about, summed up, is that they had a taste of a seedy life and it was abruptly taken away from them and they feel the repercussions of their actions.<br />Science Fiction/Double Feature-5 out of 5-A re-telling of the movie, in song form! =D<br />This movie isn't for everyone.  You'd have to have a very open mind to be able to sit through it.
B000W91RUG|5|The thing that endears me to this show is that I have known guys just exactly like the ones depicted here.  The writers must have too for they have the characters down flawlessly.  Sheldon is, of course, my favorite and I want so much to be annoyed by  him but I just can't, you have to love him.  That, I think, is the whole appeal of the show.  You want to be annoyed by these guys but you cant.  All you can do is sit and watch and laugh out loud.  In a time when there is so much stupid comedy, this is intelligent writing.  I hope it has a long run and I will definitely be watching every episode.
B006FPFTMS|1|Wasted my time downloading.  Wasn't what I expected.  Will delete.  Will continue to look for something that will better fit my needs.
B003P2WO5E|4|I had never read any work by this author until he stepped in to complete Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series.  The incredible way he finished that task led me to pick up this book.<br /><br />it is daunting to launch into another series that may (per the author) run for 10 or more volumes, this one is off to a compelling start.  Mr. Sanderson has once again come up with an innovative system of magic.  The main characters of the story quickly become compelling, and their individual stories hold their own within the framework of the larger tale.<br /><br />This book is definitely worth the time investment to read ... and now that the 2nd book is released you'll have something to move right along with.

B00TXZM4ES|4|I’ll never love a Darkness album as much as One Way Ticket so I won’t be comparing this album to that. Permission to land is their other classic but it’s 12 years ago so that’s not a fair comparison either – even though this album is the closest thing to PTL they’ve done since.<br /><br />So comparing Last Of Our Kind (LOOK) to the previous album, Hot Cakes seem appropriate. For all of the “good” tracks on Hot Cakes, it really only had one A grade track – Concrete. Some B pluses – Nothings Gonna Stop Us and Keep Me Hanging on. The rest were solid B’s with the one dud – She Just A Girl, Eddie.<br /><br />Last Of Our Kind is more solid and consistent, while still retaining a good variety of tunes. It’s rockier in parts than they’ve been in a while, some of it would class as hard rock. They’ve thrown in some fun, of course, but are a tad more serious than they’ve been in the past. More mature as many have called it.<br /><br />At first listen, I thought ‘Oh Dear….’ There wasn’t a lot to like on first run through but I had faith the songs would improve on me.<br />Barbarians has been out for a long time now and it’s a fun, catchy and rocking song. Pure TD tongue in cheek and a great track.<br />Open Fire (the lead single) took me a while to get into and it doesn’t rank high in my list of favourite TD songs. It’s as un-TD as TD does…. A good track but certainly not classic.<br />Last Of Our Kind is one of the new tracks that stands out on first listen and only improves from there. It’s hard not to get the chorus stuck in your head and after a couple of early run throughs of the album it was the track that stuck with me the most. It remains the stand out track.<br />Roaring Waters is a good mid-tempo rocker. Is perhaps the track that sounds the most like something from Permission To Land. Again, very likeable, but no classic. Some interesting tempo changes at the end.<br />Wheels Of The Machine is a slower track. Kind of aLove Is Only A Feeling feel about it. Another “nice” track without hitting any great heights.<br />Mighty Wings had me thinking of a Cheap Trick cover perhaps but not to be. It’s epic to say the least. The start had me thinking of Queen’s Flash Gordon soundtrack. Then you hit a Megadeth-like guitar intro and verse that progresses into a Def Leppard Adrenalize inspired over the top falsetto chorus. It perfectly fits the track 5-6 space that rock epics often occupy on an album.<br />Mudslide comes and goes pretty quickly. An OK track and though it brought a smile to my face on first listen, I could do without the Mrs Brown(‘s Boys) bookend speaking.<br />Sarah, O’Sarah has a Friday Night sound about it. The album needed a ballad like this and it’s something The Darkness do very well. A fun and catchy tune.<br />Hammer & Tongs is the third “official” pre-release track and perhaps the catchiest track here. A familiar opening riff and likeable chorus make for a solid track. It’s perhaps a bit lightweight and hangs around too long.<br />Conquerors, let’s face it, is a B Side – if B Sides existed any more. It’s not album worthy and not how an album should be closed. Sure it’s an OK song but Justin should sing it. It wouldn’t have made it onto any previous album.<br /><br />So without comparing it to Permission To Land it seems that where the majority of individual track comparisons come from!!<br /><br />All in all, some of the tracks don’t hit the heights of those before them. There aren’t too many stand out awesomely classic songs but as a complete album, it all works very well.
0756405890|5|As the first book in the Kingkiller Chronicle, \\"The Name of the Wind\\" does a good job of setting the stage and developing the characters that will then (I'm assuming) play a bigger role in the two following books.<br /><br />The interesting thing about this book - well, the Chronicle in general - is that it is split between two different time frames. In the `present' time, the main character is an inn-keeper hiding on the edge of civilization. He is fairly happy in this new role...except that deep within himself there is a longing for the glory days of old. So he begins to tell the story of this life to a scribe who wanders into the inn on accident....<br /><br />This is where the second time frame comes in - the time frame of the past. It is in this time frame that takes up the lion share of the book as it is full of daring adventures, romance and history (the history is important as it helps one to understand the new world created by Rothfuss for his characters).<br /><br />Being a fantasy novel, there is magic and the like - only in this series, the magic is more along the lines of Clarke's third law:<br /><br />\\"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\\"<br /><br />In Rothfuss' universe, this means that the `magic' used by the characters are based upon `scientific' laws and principles. For example if a character wanted to lift an object using `sympathy' (one of the types of `magic'), the user would have to use enough force to lift that object regardless if they were actually touching it or not. In addition, matter can not be created nor destroyed - thereby removing some of the more unbelievable uses of magic (as opposed to `believable' magic) promoted by other fantasy books.<br /><br />All in all, \\"The Name of the Wind\\" by Patrick Rothfuss was a good book - great characters, great plot, perhaps a tad long...but overall alright.<br /><br />Nope, the saddest part about the book is that fact that book two was just released this year - meaning that I will have to wait three to four years for the last book of the trilogy. :(ok of the trilogy. :(

B00011RPB0|5|\\"Lost in Translation\\" is director Sofia Coppola's remarkable study of the isolation and intimacy that people experience in both emotional and geographical environments. The film takes place in contemporary Tokyo where retired B-Movie actor, Bob Harris (Bill Murray) has come to film a commercial for a Japanese whiskey company. Harris spends his days enduring the bizarre yet entirely believable process of shooting a commercial in a country whose language and culture are completely beyond his understanding. He spends his evenings alone in the bedroom, the gym, or the bar of his lavish hotel where practically every moment seems surreal for one reason or another. In the bar, he meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) who has followed her photographer husband, John (Giovanni Ribisi) to Tokyo where he is working on an extended project. <br />At first, Bob and Charlotte develop a casual friendship based on their mutual sense of loneliness, lack of fulfillment, and their response to the sheer oddity of their surroundings. But soon their friendship develops into a deeper sense of understanding and intimacy, and with this come new complications. Both of them are married to spouses who for one reason or another are inaccessible, Bob is much older than Charlotte, and while he has experienced financial success and built a family, she is still at a point in her life where she is young and unsure of where she is headed. Charlotte almost never sees her husband, and the few times that she does he is busy cavorting with his colleagues and clients. Bob receives regular phone calls from his wife, but they only discuss her remodeling plans for their home. <br />In the hands of an unskilled filmmaker, this situation would be ripe for all kinds of clichéd and predictable behavior. Instead, Coppola shapes their story with impressive ease and with an extraordinary understanding of the human soul. There is a lot of subtle stuff going on between Charlotte and Bob, but we never get bored or confused as their relationship develops and then conflicts arise. Similarly, despite the fact both characters are lost in Tokyo with its intense, pop-culture energy, the film never condemns or makes fun of that place. Like their personal lives, Tokyo for Bob and Charlotte is simply a space that they inhabit but in which they also feel utterly lost.<br />While \\"Lost in Translation\\" explores some very serious themes it remains a hilarious and low-key film from start to finish. I have to agree with critics or reviewers who state that this is the best role of Bill Murray's career. Johansson also delivers an extremely skilled and subtle performance. There are also many extraordinarily funny scenes in which Bob and Charlotte find themselves interacting with people or in situations that they don't understand. During many of these scenes the film pulls no punches when it comes to fully exposing some of the more bizarre and eccentric qualities of contemporary Japanese culture.  Much to its credit, however the film does this in an upfront fashion without stooping to insults or stereotypes-it's simply too honest to do that.<br />I highly recommend this film for its humor, its insight, and for the remarkable performances from Bill Murray, Scarlet Johansson, and the city of Tokyo. Coppola should be highly commended for her creative genius as a director and as a screenwriter.
B008XG1X18|4|loveing every second of this app. took way to long to get up and running but it's here now. it does seem to take longer to open than other apps but works fine once it's opened. fix the speed and I'd give it a 5.

B00B4VI8MQ|5|This game was a great and entertaining way to relax. The story line was a bit cheesy but over all it was a fun game.
B00005176F|5|Here Blur have compiled an excellent Best of from lots of mediocre albums. They have handpicked the best tracks from their 6 albums and it is a surprisingly good CD worth owning.<br />Here we have the classic grunge-pop of 'Song 2', the ultimate indie-rock of 'Beetlebum', the fantastic gospel ballads 'The Universal' and 'Tender', the down-trodden, beautiful, lo-fi 'No Distance Left To Run', and the soaring 'She's So High' and 'This Is A Low', the latter being their best song ever.<br />Even slightly silly tracks like the funky 'Girls And Boys' complete with great bass and the overly cockney Britpop of 'Country House' and 'Parklife' sound pretty good when taken away from their respective albums and put in a more mature compilation. The cockney act isn't bearable across a whole album, but fun when only representing two or three tracks.<br />I don't like Blur, I don't like Damon Albarn. I love this compilation. Must be a canny choice of tracks. Now, if only they can make a regular album of entirely quality...
B0094M2ITG|5|A good easy tread with a reality expectation about a real world frame.q
B00AB0Z88S|5|Go log in and buy this now!  Don't think about it make a move.  This is an awesome visual experience.
B003NQ9LHQ|5|Classics are a classic for a reason. I purchased this second copy to catch anything thrown in for the anniversary. Also, because I wanted a second copy for my house at the beach.<br /><br />It's worth the money to make sure it isn't left behind. I depend on it because I care about my craft.
B0083GQ2A0|3|Great scenery is the backdrop of this formulaic allegory of nature's revenge against the wanton, selfish destruction of our planet by humans. The characters and plot line are uber cliche, but well worth enduring to be treated<br />to an extremely satisfying conclusion of the tale.
B000J1AGQI|3|Average.  Some of the acting was so 'scripted'. They worked hard to make Sam Elliot look 'toughass' with select phrases here and there when he doesnt' need it to begin with so it ends  up looking like the directors tried too hard.<br /><br />I'm not much a Platoon fan (the movie), but that movie is better then this IMO.<br /><br />Apocolypse Now is better then both by a long shot.<br /><br />I like Mel Gibson but some of the acting was just too 'scripted' and fake. Kinda disappointing.<br /><br />No disrespect to Vets who enjoyed it, but from purely a movie perspective, there are better options.
B00005Y228|4|Kylie Minogue has created an amazing dance album. In my book that earns her 4 stars. Though the songs sometimes lack quality lyrics, the beats and music create an atmosphere the makes this album truely one of a kind. I'm not a huge fan of dance pop so i subtracted one star for personal taste. Some of the standout tracks are &quot;Fever&quot;, &quot;Love at First Sight&quot; and &quot;Dancefloor&quot;. For those of you who haven't heard these songs I now offer you a breakdown of each song:<br />1) More, More, More- I was watching some show on VH1 about disco music and heard this song. It's a remake of a huge hit from the 1970's. Kylie's version sounds better than the original. It has a super disco beat and is a very enjoyable song.<br />2) Love At First Sight- Kylie's current single. I originally bought this CD and only listened to her first single but this song got me to explore the whole album. This is a super song. It makes a person feel happy and hope that you will find love at first sight.<br />3) Can't Get You Out of My Head- no matter how hard I try I can't get this song out of my head. At first I thought it was stupid and annoying but it just grew on me. I had to have this album. The song is an infectious mix of synthesized pop and kylie's unique vocals.<br />4) Fever- sounds like a slow song but gradually becomes something that is totally danceable. One of the stronger lyrical songs on this album. I recommend this to anyone that is crushing on someone. It makes you realize that everyone experiences the same feelings.<br />5) Give It To Me- This song is a bit to much Britney for me, but just like Britney you begin to really like this song. It's like a faster tempo &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot;. It's generally an enjoyable song.<br />6) Fragile- It is like a ballad that is placed on top of some fast beats. It is a pretty song but would have been better if it was just a ballad. This is the weakest of the songs but it is still better than most dance pop i've heard lately.<br />7) Come Into My World- Another addictive song. The beginning sounds like Madonna's &quot;Ray of Light&quot; but the song changes after that. The chorus sounds a little haunting. I think it's a great mix of everything that they decided to put into this song. My only recommendation is that you listen to this song.<br />8) In Your Eyes- This song has a beat that will stick with you forever. I bet this will be a huge hit on dancefloors. It follows in the tradition of the rest of this album, a danceable song that sounds different from the rest of the songs out right now.<br />9) Dancefloor- I have this song on repeat. It's a short song that leaves you wanting more everytime it ends. This is the standout song of the album. I hope that this is released as a single because it is excellent.<br />10) Love Affair- another great dance song. Has a disco feel to it as well. It has very pretty lyrics and Kylie's voice turns this into what could be a huge hit. The chorus is a description of a love affair and it well written. Very danceable.<br />11) Your Love- Very similar to the previous song but with a slightly different feel. Is prettier sounding than lots of dance songs which rely on beats while this song relies more on vocals and there is even some use of guitars in this song.<br />12) Burning Up- starts a slow song for about thirty seconds and then she says &quot;I'm burning up&quot; a zillion times and then it goes slow again and fast again. This is the trend for the song. It sounds terrible when I describe it but it actually sounds really good.<br />Basically this is a dance pop CD. If you like dance pop you'll love this CD, if not you might enjoy it anyways. A lot of people I know like this CD that you would think would hate it but it's really popular.d lately.<br />7) Come Into My World- Another addictive song.

B00BVYNSLC|5|Can't wait for the third season!
B00IMYVCEY|4|The item was exactly what I ordered. There was no problems redeeming the UV codes. You just have to redeem them through the Universal Digital Copy web page. Doing it this way only requires that the activation code be input to identify the movie. All six movies were redeemed and are in my Vudu account. Would recommend this set even for people in the US that are put off by other comments that the codes would not work in the US. I live in Texas so they do work. I bought the set to watch all of the movies again before buying the new movie when it comes out on Blu-Ray.
B005ZOBNOI|4|Saw the movie and read the book; the book is much better, more complete.  Nice story!
B005LAJ22Q|5|The first season of this show was often clumsy with its unfamiliar characters, and usually focused too much on the zombie/horror aspect, which we had all seen too many times before to be much affected by ... In other words, because we didn't know much about these characters, we didn't care too much about their efforts; whether they survived or not was a matter mostly of indifference. The presentation was amazing, yes, but still, the show only showed promise; it was not a good product.<br /><br />Season two is different, an amazing experience. The characters are developed in such a way, and the zombie world portrayed in such a dramatic light, that it transcends the horror genre and becomes more theater than anything. Wonderful stuff, almost Shakespearean. Some of the best writing I have ever seen for television. Brilliant acting and direction, with a superb cast. The Rick versus Shane subplot is amazing for several reasons: 1st, the anti-hero is portrayed as being superficially right, but morally wrong, so that we are led to question which is the more valuable trait in this world, the survivalist instincts Shane possesses, or the conscience of a moral man, which Rick maintains. Rick (the moralist) is consistently wrong in his decisions, yet has the favor of the group, whereas the villain of the season becomes Shane, who has nonetheless acted more heroically than any of the others. Yet in the end, who lives and who dies in this new world, and why? A wonderful paradox unfolding, very engaging to watch. The romantic triangle between Rick, Shane, and Laurie is deep in a way that puts most other television writers' efforts to shame. You have the fact that Shane is responsible for saving Rick's family again and again; without him, he would have no reason to continue on. And you have the nature of Laurie's love, a continual question. Did she love Shane or only find comfort with him? And you have Shane's love, continually disregarded throughout both seasons (as Rick declaresto him at one pivotal point in the story, \\"You think you love Laurie, but you don't.\\" The viewer, meanwhile, is not so sure.) It could even be argued in the last two episodes that the anti-hero becomes the hero only to be killed by the hero turned anti-hero. In any case, it's a very thoughtful underpinning to the whole.<br /><br />I found other plot developments nearly as engaging: the vain efforts to find Sophia, the \\"judge, jury, and executioner\\" episode, where Rick is called on (again) to decide which is more important: the safety of the group, or the preservation of his humanity, and the whole hope issue in a world where civilization has vanished and mankind faces its \\"extinction event.\\" This last was toyed with in the final episodes of the first season, but not nearly so well as here.<br /><br />A beautiful scene unfolds in a deserted bar between Rick and another survivor that I found striking: it is impossible to tell who is acting rightly and who in the gray or the black, who the villain. Everyone and everything is mixed up here, heroes and villains, friends and enemies.<br /><br />Shane soon proceeds down a path to murder Rick ostensibly \\"for the good of the group\\" yet does not do so, placing his weapon back in his belt at one point and raising his arms. We are given the feeling that he may not be capable of murdering his friend outright. A great scene.<br /><br />Not anything to complain about here, other than I wish there was more of it. The Walking Dead seasons are too short.
B008Q085Q2|4|A fine film in all matters technical and artistically. The performances are ace, the production design is stunning, with one foot planted in historical fact and the other treading the best of modern film noir!...ZP
B0002IVN9W|3|I suspect that, like many who picked up the CD, it was done based on rave reviews elsewhere. However, after giving a couple of listens to this CD, I have to admit being mildly disappointed. I was expecting tremendous things, but &quot;Funeral&quot; did not deliver. Perhaps it is the victim of heightened expectations; I don't know. Still, there are some excellent moments on this CD; however, they do not add up to a classic - certainly not one that ranked very high on critics' polls. The lead singer has both an off-putting and intriguing singing voice. It reminds me a bit of Roger Waters of Pink Floyd. For a debut album, this is very good. The talent is there, and I expect great(er) things from Arcade Fire. For now, I would easily give the nod to fellow Montrealers Stars &quot;Set Yourself on Fire&quot;, which is the better of the two CDs.
B007FG9LIE|1|Absolutely ridiculous story! I was tempted many times to stop wasting my time reading this absurd tale, but felt inclined to finish it just to see where this silliness culminates. I did find out.! Good grief!
B006LSZECO|4|I did enjoy this book ,it kept you wondering which way it would go. I didn't like the ending. It was a messed up ending. I will probably go see the movie when it comes out and hope for a better ending. Lisa
B000E1ZBGS|5|Fantastic Movie
B00H2EQFBK|4|Enjoyed the shows
B0095R64AO|2|My wife wanted to watch this and I reluctantly agreed.  Se really liked it, found it funny and generally a decent romantic comedy.  I never got into it.  The basic plot just did not grab me so the rest of the movie just kind of went blah for me.  I wish I could give a better description but really I just lost interest in the first 20 minutes and rest is a blur when I try to remember it.<br /><br />One thing I can add is that we rented this on Amazon Video and continue to have a great experience with it.  We use a PS3 as our Blu-ray and ome media player.

B000002N2Z|5|This cd has to be the best eveer made, the band is totally awsome!  Chino's (the lead singer)lyrical ability is incredible, not to mention the awsome riffs drums and bass lines.  this cd is best listened to in it's  entirety at a loud volume.  All of the girls will want to borrow this one!   BUY IT!
B004SBS8LA|5|love the look and feel of Rio- fun to have different objectives, great graphics, and boss fights are a great idea!
030726999X|4|I bought the three book set through Amazon and the price was great.<br /><br />I finished the first two books really fast and the second one was the better of the first two.<br /><br />This third one is a difficult read.  It is character-laden to the point of being rediculous.  You almost need a few reference pages to reinforce who the characters are and what their purpose is in the story line so you don't get them mixed up. You want to read it because you want to know what happens to Salander but you will have to slog through a lot of stuff before you do find out.  And, in the end, you won't know who the heck half of the people are and why they have to be in it in the first place.<br /><br />It is tooooooo much work!

B000PKG7I4|5|Amy is bad.  I have a hard time saying 'was' because I still can't accept that she's gone.  Such an amazing talent, it kills me that we won't be getting new music from her.  When she first came out I didn't even bother to buy her stuff because I hadn't heard her sound and I assumed I wouldn't like her.  What a surprise.  Amy could hold her own with any of the past greats (like Billie Holiday, whom I love, or Etta James).  Yet her sound is fresh and new and could be listened to alongside any current artist.  I just love her so much.  Her voice was an unbelievable gift. I played Back to Black until I damn near wore the tracks off the cd and then had to buy another.  I bought Frank yesterday and I'm in love already.  Such a jazzy, funky, yet totally original sound.  I looove her voice.  So sad that she's gone.  I only hope that before she passed, someone told her how unique, original, creative and totally talented she was.  She didn't get nearly enough credit.
B00DHSK3RM|1|Very disappointed with this product!  I found this guide no help at all and actually deleted it.  Was looking for something when I started game that would help me understand moves of game.

B00BD99JMW|1|I have never anticipated a book being released as much as this one.  I loved the first two books and recommended them to everyone.  I will never do that again.  I loved Four and Tris together, and wanted a happy ending for them.  I feel upset the author would end the series like this.  Four and Tris being together were what made these books so moving and addictive.  Now I wish I never would have read this series, especially Allegiant.  I will never watch this movie, read any more books by this author, and will tell everyone not to waaste their time reading this series.

0738711500|5|I have been reading Tarot cards for many years and have used several different decks.  I came across this deck and book when I was looking for a deck and book set that would benefit a new reader.  While many people suggest starting with the traditional style Rider-Waite, I found the colors dull and the images lacking.  This deck is beautiful and inspiring, and the accompanying book is very well-written and organized in a very thoughtfully-planned way.  The learning method suggested is one of the simplest yet effective plans for learning and interpreting the cards in a realistic and meaningful manner, and is also an excellent way for an experienced reader to re-connect with the cards or to attune to a new or different deck.    This set gets high marks from me and I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in Tarot.
B0065GC0BA|5|The best book I have read for a long time! So sad but inspiring and beautifully written and regardless of the heartbreak it was rather amusing. Great characters. This is the first book I have read from JoJo Moyes but it won't be the last
B00499NHLC|5|I viewed this on my laptop. I had no trouble  with the internet connection. (Sometimes internet connection in our rural area causes problems.) Audio was perfect. If I had a complaint about the video service it would be the suggestion of adding subtitles. (But subtitles would be for any program or film, not for Sherlock specifically.)<br /><br />I love this version of Sherlock Holmes. I love that it is modernized and yet still holds qualities from Doyle's books, such as wit, devotion, and detailed case studies. Of course the benefit to this series compared to other Sherlock series, is the amazing minds of Steve Moffat and Mark Gatiss, plus Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman.<br /><br />As a viewer without traditional cable or satellite TV, I was unaware of this series in its beginnings. I am thankful that I did not have to wait the two years for series three. (Thank you, Amazon.)<br /><br />This show runs a bit differently than American TV shows as each episode is an hour and a half long (vs. 50 mins.) and there are typically only 3 episodes per season (vs. 18-22 episodes).
B000FP2OPY|5|Supernatural is easily my favorite show. I purchased season 1 followed by all of the other season, and I would highly recommend them to everyone. There is emotion, comedy, thrill, and suspense. Great story following the Winchester brothers!
B00D7Z4GQY|4|A good vacation read!!  It kept me glued to my chase lounge for a couple of days!  :)
B0088W6LGY|5|Love it!
B00D8CSVLW|4|Definitely a return to form for mr Grisham , although the ending is quite easy to see coming. Well worth it!
B00H7MSYKC|5|Great way to learn the animals of the world. Good for memory help and for teaching young children. Love it.
B00EEN66SY|3|The movie was actually very good. My only guilt with liking it is that the characters were based on real people, who are probably thrilled there was a movie based on them. Hopefully the consequences they faced were enough to not make them act like such sociopaths anymore, but it seems like most got a slap on the wrist. Thieves are the most despicable people!
B00JCW0BCY|5|This book is extremely well written and it talks about a very important subject. Everyone should read this book and think about these issues.<br />It certainly is thought-provoking. I am grateful that I have read it. Thank you.
B009LGO88E|4|It does what it's intended to do for monster hunter but it's unfortunate that it's not applicable for most games. It kind of gets tedious to take it off for some games and put it back on only for monster hunter.
B004XJRQUQ|5|I was hesitant  to read this series because of the hype surrounding  the new movies. I thought it would be similar to the twilight series. I could never have been more wrong. I was immediately swept up in the story and finished all three books in two days. Katniss is a real character and I respect that Collins showed how terrifying taking lives can be for one who survives it. As a reader I fell in love with Peeta and he is a character you can root for. Overall one of the best books I've read in a long time!!!
B000002UCE|5|This is one of the best albums of all time. The song Imagine is truly a classic....maybe the song of the last half of this century.  This is John at his very finest.
B00LU0P9L4|1|Looked fun tried downloading 3 days ago and it is still trying so I stopped it.
B00IJJUIMY|5|Treat read. Harry Bosch is one of my favorite characters
B005CVWWJY|3|An easy read (perhaps a bit too easy) and moderately entertaining, I would guess the audience who will enjoy this book the most are 15-30 years of age and have a well above average interest in computer games, movies and all things related.<br />I usually read more hard core sci-fi like William Gibson and Bruce Sterling, so to me it just wasn't serious and complex enough to really interest me in a profound manner.<br />That being said, I found the book very difficult to put down and read it at a faster pace than usual, so it couldn't have been that bad.
B00DHKKN6Q|5|Don't miss the best in the eastern coast .Seriously don't miss this awesome game. You will be drawn to it for hours.
B00005LC1H|5|I love this show!! you gotta see it!
B005ZOBNOI|5|Loved and enjoyed this novel!
B0080BFWAE|5|very funny
B008Z9YLV2|4|Close to the book.  Difficult to fault the deviations, though.  It would have been two hours (or more) longer, if they had followed the book correctly.  The passion and drama of the book did show through.  Well done!
B004DLPXAO|3|It's fine
0062365584|5|Opposites attract.  In humans, the attraction may not be initial, but we can become drawn to mates from whom we initially repel or we can repel after years of atraction.  David Nicholls has created two lives who came together, together made a third, then as each of the three attempted to come to terms with the changing \\"us\\" of the family, entertained us with the ch-ch-ch-changes that occurred after one decided she was done.  Following the announcement of an imminent separation wanted by Connie, the wife and mother, the family followed through with a European summer journey where the son explored his own \\"us\\" while the estranged elders experienced their changed relationship.  Nicholls created in, [[ASIN:0062365584 Us: A Novel]], through the eyes and memory of Douglas Petersen, a witty, humorous and often times insecure personality, an exquisite story which provided in 180 extremely short chapters a well-written, challenging tale of family history using lively backdrops of hotels, museums, restaurants and more.  This kept me reading at each sitting more than I'd intended and my only criticism of this novel is that it caused me to be late more than once.
B00GCE3TCE|5|It reminded me of the story Ann Frank.  I liked it because the detail of the story made the characters seem real.  The author made you feel like you was there with them in the war and against Hitler.
B00JB3MVCW|5|It was an excellent movie and I strongly recommend it! Although it was not totally Biblically accurate, No man or woman knows each detail of what took place then and it is a moving version of the story of Noah! The acting was awesome not only by Russel Crow but by each of the actors and actresses that played in the movie. I was left wanting more, but that is the case in all really good movies.
B0055SWM08|5|great game! lots of challenging fun! keep making these please! I could play all day. keeps getting more and more challenging. it's making my mind young again.
B002HJ9PTO|5|I use this on my go-pro 2 on my scoots , no wind noise no matter how fast I'm going . I give this an A+  .<br /><br />TheReaper!
B00DR0PDNE|5|Honestly, out of the box, I was like ugh what a waste of money because I couldnt want Amazon Movies or MLG.TV. Till I realized there's the chromecast extension for google chrome. Ive been able to watch everything I want off of Amazon, MLG, TWITCH, and more.<br /><br />I have my TV mounted on a wall behind my computer desk and if I ever want a movie or tv show running in the background with the click of a button on my browser tab it'll pop up on my tv. If i want a family member to see something on my browser without them hovering over my desk they can see it on my TV. Seriously you cant beat the 35 bucks to have this little device, once you get the grip of using it you can't be without it. This is definitely something I will travel with to any hotel so I can watch a movie without paying an outrageous hotel movie rental charge. I'm not signed up for netflix or hulu but for Amazon Prime and among other sites that are free online to watch latest episodes or movies.<br /><br />If your not a must see now type of person then you could get rid of your cable bill with just catching up with episodes online using this device. If im feeling lazy I just use my phone to watch movies, but for the chance to watch more shows and movies I would recommend just using your google chrome browser on your desktop computer, and yes desktop! I dont use a laptop or tablet I use my desktop with the google chromecast extension available for your google chrome browser.
B0061PEAUY|5|BONES ARE FOREVER :I know this is a good book because I have read all of her other books over the years. Unfortunately, my copy of Bones Are Forever was bad and I had to call and report it.  It seems that I kept reading the same pages over and over....I was told that they had had lots of problems with that book and credited my account $3.12.  I see that it is still offered on you life and wonder if it is the same copy I had or what.  I would still like to read the book.
0316322407|4|My wife and mother in law loved this book.
B00AZMFJYA|5|I love Star Trek I've loved it ever since the 1960's and I a specially love this new movie I hope they make more in the future.

B005AUWXZ0|5|My Son Love It
B0041KKYBA|5|This book explains what happened better than any other book written on the subject and it is easy to understand.  How the banking system is so totally ----ed up that is.  It will make you mad.  Buy it.  Read it.
0784011176|5|This is a brilliant movie. While not a 'chick flick' it does look at things from a woman's point of view but that is what makes it more intense, romantic, poetic and moving. Beautiful dream-like cinematography and score  make the New Zeland coast and jungles come alive. Beautiful ensemble acting  by the 4 leads especially Anna Paquina and Holly Hunter. Sam Neill is also  great as the husband who slowly goes insane, and Harvey Keitel surprised me  in this un-typical role for him, he's always been a great actor and this is  proof of it. Beautifully filmed poetic scenes and a special 'women's touch'  courtesy of Jane Campion. From a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a 9!
B006CUZ7FA|5|This was an enjoyable second installment to the Harry Potter movies.  It is one of my favorites as well.
B002TLSSXO|5|I use these daily. I hung them up on my kitchen wall & so handy. I do not need a spoon rest anymore as they never touch my counter/table.
B004SIP86Q|5|When I ran across a VHS tape of this, in a thrift store, I had never heard of the movie, or of the true story that it was based on.<br /><br />I only knew, given the date of the release (per the VHS tape sleeve), that it would represent one of the first feature films in which Kate Winslet appeared (it turns out that it was *the* first) ... and I recognized the actress who played the other lead role (as in, I strongly suspected that it was an actress I'd seen in productions since, but had never seen her at so young an age, and had no idea that she'd been acting this long), but I hadn't previously known her name (something that can be said of many terrific character actors), and suspected that it might be one of the first feature films in which she appeared (as with Kate Winslet, it turns out to have been Melanie Lynskey's feature film debut).<br /><br />I was also intrigued by the fact that Peter Jackson directed, co-produced, and co-wrote the screenplay for the film -- and given the honors bestowed upon him over the past decade, I was curious to see an example of his work from early in his career.<br /><br />Fran Walsh, Peter Jackson's long-time writing (and life) partner, had originally heard of the events (upon which the film is based) when she was 10, and news of the associated crime and trial were reported extensively in newspapers (in New Zealand, where the events occurred), and had shocked the country.<br /><br />Fran remained interested in the case... and after she recommended to Peter that they write a screenplay based on the events, it was ultimately decided that they would focus on the girls' friendship, rather than the murder and trial -- and there are several reasons why it made/makes sense for them to have done so.<br /><br />Interestingly, Fran Walsh and Peter Jackson engaged in a nationwide search for people who had had close association with Pauline Parker and Juliet Hulme (the girls whose actions form the basis of the film) back when the friendship,and the events in question, took place -- 40 years before.<br /><br />According to online sources, this involved tracking down the girls' former classmates and teachers, 17 of whom were interviewed... and speaking with family friends, colleagues, neighbors, psychologists, police, and lawyers.<br /><br />Importantly, the background research for the film also included Fran Walsh and Peter Jackson reading Pauline's diary, which contained daily entries of detailed description of the friendship, and events associated with such.<br /><br />All of the voiceover narration in the film is of excerpts from Pauline's diary (this is conveyed to the viewer via a brief statement, at the beginning of the film).<br /><br />Fran Walsh searched 'high and low', in a widespread search of schools from throughout New Zealand, for someone who looked a lot like Pauline, and could act. The difficulty in finding such an actress ultimately culminated in the discovery of Melanie Lynskey.<br /><br />The first casting calls took place in 1992. Kate Winslet won the role of Juliet, over 175 others who had auditioned.<br /><br />The incredible performances of the co-lead actresses in this film is rendered all the more astonishing when one considers their respective ages at the time of filming (Winslet was born in October 1975, and Lynskey in May 1977).<br /><br />Peter Jackson's creative direction for this film is quite amazing, and the visual effects used (and back in the early 1990s, no less), to bring the rich fantasy life of the girls 'to life', are not only highly creative, but visually captivating, and the montage 'sequences' in question (and especially when they 'overlap' a reality-based scene) are innovative and 'arresting'.<br /><br />As with various other fascinating 'older' movies that I happen to ultimately 'stumble upon', I am then curious (after viewing such a film) about what others had to say about the film, and especially from back when it was released.<br /><br />It turns out (andwhat an odd little coincidence this is) that I happen to have watched this film (yesterday) on the 19th anniversary of the date associated with Roger Ebert's review of the film.<br /><br />And while my few movie reviews don't tend to focus on a 'retelling' of a film's plot (given that so many other reviews tend to already have done so), and do, instead, focus more on things I find to be exceptional or noteworthy, or convey reflections I found myself 'chewing on' after viewing a film, etc., I did find a few of Roger Ebert's comments to be rather interesting, and find that I am in agreement with him, when it comes to his 'take' on the film -- and thought I'd include a few excerpts, for those who might not have viewed other (and plot-centered) reviews of this film --<br /><br />------------------<br />The movie shows the crime as resulting from a tragic confluence of coincidences: Two girls, both emotionally unstable in just the right way to complement each other's weaknesses, are outsiders in a Christchurch girls' school. [...]<br />------------------<br /><br />------------------<br />The girls are separated when one contracts tuberculosis.<br /><br />They begin to write each other long, detailed letters about the events in an imaginary country they have created, with dream castles and heroic figures with which they identify. Jackson uses fantasy sequences to make this world as real for us as it is to the girls, who inhabit it as an alternative to the daily lives they find dreary.<br />------------------<br /><br />------------------<br />Casting is a delicate matter in telling a story like this, and in Melanie Lynskey as Pauline and Kate Winslet as Juliet, Jackson has found the right two actresses. There is a way Lynskey has of looking up from beneath glowering eyebrows that lets you know her insides are churning. And Juliet, superficially so \\"bright\\" and normal, laughs too much, agrees too quickly, always exists just this side of hysteria.<br />------------------<br /><br />------------------<br />The insight of \\"Heavenly Creatures\\" is that sometimes people are capable of committing acts together that they could not commit by themselves. A mob can be as small as two persons. [...] In the case of Pauline and Juliet, that truth is complicated by their own emotional maladjustments. What makes Jackson's film enthralling and frightening is the way it shows these two unhappy girls, creating an alternative world so safe and attractive they thought it was worth killing for.<br />------------------<br /><br />Lastly, on a final note...<br /><br />This film was released in 1994, and to well-deserved critical acclaim, and high praise in reviews from around the world. Laudatory attention was focused on the acting of the co-lead actresses, and for Jackson's directing, as well as for the screenplay, which was co-written by Walsh and Jackson, and was nominated for an Academy Award (that year's award for Best Original Screenplay ended up going to Quentin Tarantino, for \\"Pulp Fiction\\").<br /><br />Of the various terms used by others to describe this film, and its acting, direction, cinematography, and script...the following descriptors are among those I find to reflect my perception and 'conclusions', as well --<br /><br />Exemplary, imaginative, disturbing, stunning, haunting, incisive, shocking, complex, thoughtful, astonishing, unforgettable, superb, dark, masterpiece...<br /><br />This is a riveting story, told in a magnificently rendered fashion, and is considered by some to be the best true crime film they've ever seen.<br /><br />I remain 'taken aback' by just how incredible this film is, and will now be sure to obtain a DVD version of such -- especially given that the DVD releases in Region 1 format include an 'uncut' version of the film, which is 109 minutes, versus the 99 minutes found in the original runtime version (and which is associated with the VHS, laserdisc, and DVD Regions 2 & 4 releases, as well as the version streamed onNetflix and HuluPlus).<br /><br />This film is an early peek at the genius of Peter Jackson's remarkable directorial talent and vision, and the great collaborative writing from the earlier years of the now-20-plus-years-along team of Fran Walsh and Peter Jackson.<br /><br />That being said, Melanie Lynskey is reported to have said that Jackson and Walsh acted as co-directors.<br /><br />\\"Heavenly Creatures\\" is a riveting film, and its masterful production highlights an originality in filmmaking that is a wonder to behold.
B00F87ZUYG|4|Hey I love the show but I think it is losing a little excitement, I have only watched a couple episodes I hope we get something new. Right now it is getting a bit dull.
B0064J6OMO|4|The movie started out funny, fizzled for about 20 minutes but ended up being pretty funny.<br /><br />Both actors are believable in the portrayal of two guys who switched bodies. This isn't a raunchy comedy it's more of a chick flick. Overall several laughs were had. This movie is much funnier than \\"Horrible Bosses\\". Not as funny as Cedar Rapids though.<br /><br />I would recommend watching it.
B007ZRZF8I|5|this is a great app for the kindle fire. in app purchases are annoying but not needed to play. over all, GET THIS APP!!!!

1476715904|5|Such a beautiful book. This is my second book written by Colleen Hoover that I've read. I simply couldn't put it down. Made you laugh,cry..read it. You won't be disappointed!
B00I8Q77Y0|5|This game is better than flappy bird hands down! I love how the pipes change color as well as the bird.
B001QPBKJI|3|I'm only reviewing the short 30 second sound bites provided by Amazon.  Based on those alone, I decided not to purchase this album.  Though Ms. Mutter's performance is technically accurate, the music comes across lackluster and unimaginative.  There is nothing here to set it apart from other renditions of the same piece.  It's like looking at a very good copy of the Mona Lisa.  You know in your heart that something is missing, but can't quite put your finger on it.  The cover is the best part of this album.
B00BEZTMQ8|5|Muy Buena Película, en un formato adecuado, no he tenido ningun problema con ella para visualizarla. Una adición recomendable para todos los que nos gusta LOTR.
B0025VLELQ|4|We all found it to be very much worth watching after all this time.  And the young childern in the house loved it. They are a new generation of Starfighters.
B00026ZG10|5|I can not tell you how often we have watched this movie it has serious moments and funny moments. Fast paste also.
B00BVYNSLC|5|Great show. Exciting story lines, great characters and amazing acting.
B0042U94UQ|5|My family enjoyed both movies, it kept the attention of my 10yr old grandson and his cousin, not one complaint.
B00DR0PDNE|4|Great gadget!  My tv is a few years old so it took awhile to get it all connected, but then it worked great.  One thing it won't do is play your own recorded video. .. of your family, etc off your device  unkess you post it from a site like You tube.
B00005BF9Z|5|Manu Chao (Called Mano Negra at the pretty beginning), known internationally, is one of the most creative, innovative singers, the music world have ever seen. <br />High recommended
B00006RIO7|5|AHH i love this movie and soudtrack so much! i have seen the movie 4 times so far and almost know all the coreography for &quot;all that jazz&quot; one of my favorite songs in the movie.  i love that scene the best but i love the &quot;cell block tango&quot; almost more! i cant get enough of the soundtrack and movie! im listening to &quot;all that jazz&quot; right now! after this movie catherive zeta-jones is my favorite actress! i was so happy about the awards at the oscars it recieved! best soundtrack ever!
B0024FAR5M|4|I don't have cable and this is a great way to watch as if I'm really watching the series the first year. I watch one episode per week. Every Monday I watch one show and can't wait to watch next week.  The dvd arrived in short order. Thank you Amazon.
B00006SFBD|1|This has to be a joke! When ever my office gets bored we crank this cd up and laugh ourselves into hysterics. Damnation is an awsome album but then when I picked this up I couldnt stop laughing. Great stuff for the kids!
B009UX2YAC|4|It is a good game, it's challenging and fun. It does take some time to download and some times it glitches. It does not glitch all the time time for me. Also, every once in a while I have to go to the home screen and  tap the app again, but other than that it is a great game!!! 👏😄
B000N3STBQ|2|What an incredible album, recorded and mixed at the legendary Hansa Studios in Berlin, where Bowie's Heroes was recorded.  Oh, wait.  This version was mixed recently, using pro-tools, without the wonderful ambience of Hansa... without Gareth Jones and Alan Wilder at the helm.  Unfortunately, it shows.  However, the extras are worth getting, and I dare say it's worth buying just for an A/B comparison with the original issue just to show how real acoustics beat out convoluted (their word, not mine) reverb algorithms EVERY TIME.
B001HXG8PK|4|Love the Dark Night love the music Zimmer is one of the best  and Nolan is outstanding - Batman Returns was just as good maybe even better.  Cant wait for the third installment this summer.  Should be special but alas that might be the end on Nolan's Batman
0312600844|5|I'll just add another voice of praise for this superb book. There's no need to be fancy or pedantic: Freedom is a masterpiece. I don't remember ever being so addicted to a book for over a decade, and that's what most important--this book reinstilled in me a love of reading that's lain dormant long enough for me to forget it. I'd forgotten books could be this good, but this one is. It's a wild, dizzying, brutally insightful, wonderfully heartbreaking novel--not enough good can be said about it. Walter Berglund's rise to fall in his final meltdown was one of the most exciting things I've ever read. And though this novel is more literary than other literary works (puts their aspirations to shame, in other words), it also moves along as smoothly as any airport pop lit. Franzen understands people in their conflicting idiosyncrasies too well. The only negative that can be said here is that anything else will pale in comparison. What can be read after Freedom?    The negative reviews are mostly kneejerk contrarians or ad hominem attackers. That is, people don't like the book a) because other people (too many other people) like it, or b) because people don't like Franzen for extremely nebulous reasons, such as he's \\"pretentious,\\" a word that's been so abused and misused as to mean nothing anymore, or that he's a crank, or an elitist, and even if this is true, which not one reviewer negative or positive has any clue of--even if this is true, it doesn't mean that art and artist aren't infinitely separable. They are; they always are.
B00B0NDF26|5|If you're a Tegan and Sara fan already you won't be disappointing.<br />This album is a little more straight forward and less cryptic than previous albums, but I love it nonetheless.
0345803485|1|This book is so bad that reading it will make anyone think they can be a successful writer.  I agree with all the other reviews that criticize the nauseating over-use of the same old adjectives, phrases and descriptions.  A gorgeous, Ivy league-educated, wealthy 27 year old CEO would want a backward, unsophisticated, tripping and falling all over the place, frumpily dressed, works in a hardware store, wears no make-up and doesn't fix her hair virgin???????  It is laughable.  His character is somewhat interesting but her character is so unbelievable that the story turns into a comedy that made me lose interest fast.  If you are so curious that you must check it out, just go to a bookstore and read a bit.  You will be glad that you didn't waste your money.<br /><br />One last thing....the author keeps referring to \\"sex' as a body part.  She writes \\"he cupped my sex\\", \\"he grabbed my sex\\", etc.  I think she is using the word sex as a noun for crotch or vagina.  Is this a British thing?
B00CLD65X0|5|The writing is great, as is the acting. The storyline is interesting. And it is great to see how an older generation comes to grips with &#34;modern&#34; day change.
B008Z9YLV2|5|Very surprised by my enjoyment of this series. My 11 yr. old pushed me to watch the first two. We saw the newest one today in the theater and loved it. Great storyline with excellent casting. Phillip Seymour Hoffman will be missed.
B00P77ZAN8|2|This game, just like world of Warcraft, is ruined by blizzard's demand for money. This game allows you to play against computers, normal or hard difficulty, as well as play against other players for free. To play adventures / dungeons (to gain cards) or just to get more cards, you'll have to pay as much as $25! Each! That's USD! You can grind for weeks to unlock the first level of the dungeons... I forgot why I quit playing WOW until I started playing this... It's a shame... Update: I just saw the update requires precise GPS location now! Uninstalled! Minus one star for this alone.
B001KP2J3U|4|As much as I consider David Suchet the quintessential Poirot, this rendition with Peter Ustinov is quite entertaining and has a lot of additional &#34;star power&#34; that provides further interest for the viewer.  Ustinov as Poirot in Evil Under the Sun is also enjoyable.  As my daughter pointed out,  Professor Mcgonagill (of Harry Potter fame) is also in Evil Under the Sun among other well known actors.  The scenery alone is worth it.
B00HL2EN6W|5|My boys love this!!!
B00005JLR8|4|Not being knowledgeable about movie techniques, I base my comments strictly on feelings aroused by the movie: <br />puzzlement - if they are immigrating from Ireland why are they driving across a border (finally realized they came in illegally through Canada)?  Who is this Frankie they keep talking about (Oh, it's the deceased son)?  What did they say (wish they wouldn't mumble some of the important lines)? <br />Sadness - Once you get tuned in, the family's adjustment to America, to being poor, to living in a slum, to not finding work, to finding each other after the horrible loss in their life... it's sad. <br />Joy - the moments where the family successfully connects or communicates with each other, or with their neighbors, particularly the black artist evoke feelings of joy. <br />Beauty - despite the depressing setting and the depressing loss of Frankie, the family is beautiful and their innocence touches even the dying neighbor who before was consumed with anger at his fatal disease. <br />In the final summing up, it is a movie that touches you, makes you think, and sticks in your mind.  Isn't that what movie making is all about?  <br />
B00L9B7IKE|2|Messed up people
B000XUBFE2|5|Great read!  Death is the narrator-It's a  very intense story- a few tears shed. I would recommend  this book to anyone.
B00IINPXLW|4|I like the game but it is yet another one that almost requires that you buy items to help. I personally found it frustrating.
B003Y5D776|4|A must have for MacBook Pro  Retina! If you want something simple and clean and don't want to use a big interface, this works perfect. There's no mic input on a Retina so this works great.
B006LSZECO|3|Mixed feelings.  Initially I hated Nick and Amy. And then I got to the second part of the book and hated Amy and felt sorry for Nick. He wasn't really a sleaze..he became what Amy created him to be. She is the worst fictional character ever created..not a single redeeming quality.  I would have given the book five stars if the author would have seen it through to a believable conclusion but unfortunately the plot twist at the end exists for the sole purpose of being unpredictable. so the end was very anti climactic
0553386794|5|This is what i call a good reading and so as the Series itself,.<br />But i was a little disappointed when they killed off one of my Favorite<br />Characters,(drogo) at the beginning.<br />So as i know, how the series will END...
B00005JN7O|5|\\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" is an evolutionary experience. Movies have never been like this; but they should be! The visual intensity is nearly unbelievable. The Fictional Universe of the story took on a dream like quality do to the production methods. The whole movie seemed more real, more believable, because of the `memory' like elements used to produce it. The soft edges, and brush stoke quality of the characters blurred the lines between \\"live action\\" and \\"blue screen\\" creations. With any luck movies will move in this direction from henceforth. The evolution of the movie has been a long time coming but with the appearance of \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" that evolution is here now.  <br />  <br /> <br />
B00O0OR65E|5|Easy to level up and very fun to play glad I found this one.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5|It's great but I wish it had online multiplayer
B0083Z614S|3|Since I'm only 1/2 way through I find it a good book especially for young people to read.
B004GJDQT8|3|i like amazon for shopping but due to having so many android devices. not all of them can use android with it being supported like the ouya amazon still has yet to set u its apps for the ouya setup and controls this is why i took a star<br />the other reason i took a star is they keep sending me emails about amazon prime that i have it and it has never been used  this is because its not as clear to use what can you do and what cant you do whats the point of watching anything on prime if you have to pay for everything worth watching individually this is why  took a second star
B00J8CGU64|5|My only thought is how many brokers actually live with this mindset.....oh, that's right, It's sales. This is what happens with drugs and money? Just Crazy&#62;
B0063IH60K|5|Classic with options to suit your playing style. I like to use the deal winning hand for my kids. Great app.
B000OLROWC|5|Great!
030746363X|5|I read 4 Hour Work Week over a year ago and Tim's advice has really helped me be more productive and generally happier. 4 Hour Body is Tim changing my life all over again. I've been treating the book as a reference and adopting Tim's strategies one chapter at a time as encouraged in the book. I have to say I've been impressed with how quickly results are showing. After just 3 weeks of following the Slow-Carb Diet to around 90% of specification I dropped > 10 pounds, > 2% body fat, and whipped my good and bad cholesterol numbers into shape. I know my results would be even better if I followed the advice more closely, but this works for me.    I really love that you can pick and choose what you want to get out of the book and that his methodologies are still effective even if you don't take them to the sometimes extreme degree that he does.
B00E3BK0QQ|4|I wish the free game modes were longer.<br />But the story was good.I like the adventure wondering what lies around the next corner
0545123267|5|At the age of nine, Grace is torn away from a swing she is playing by a pack of wolves that come into her yard.  Surely she should have been killed, but one wolf - one with particular captivating eyes appears to save her.  Since that day Grace feels a connection with the wolves and sees the wolf with the eyes many times throughout the years around her home, almost as if he is watching her.  In an odd way, Grace is comforted by the wolf's presence.<br /><br />Then, when Grace is seventeen, a boy she attends school with is killed in a wolf attack and the hunters take to the woods.  Grace finds a boy on her doorstep with a gun shot wound... oddly, the boy has very familiar eyes... almost like her wolf...<br /><br />Yes, I did it.  After Shiver has sat on my book shelf for a long long time, I finally took the time to read it.  I had heard the comparisons to the Twilight series, and before you groan about me comparing books... there is a method to my madness....<br /><br />First of all... my only real dive into the paranormal as far as vampires, and wolves go is the Twilight books (other than The Passage, but that is really not a comparable book as that is so much a deeper/ complicated read).  And I have to admit after hearing buzz about Sam (Shiver) being a much more likable that Edward (Twilight), I had to bite...  (no pun intended.)<br /><br />Ok...maybe a little bit of a pun....<br /><br />In the early pages of this read as I was introduced to Grace and Sam, I started making a mental list of what I thought so far of the Sam/Edward comparisons:<br /><br />1.  I like that in Twilight we get to know Edward and meet Edward before we are introduced to the vampire side of him.  I found it harder to connect with Sam in the beginning and I feel that is due to me first knowing him as a wolf.  I felt I had to work harder to think of him as human.<br /><br />2.  I didn't find the love connection of Sam and Grace as totally captivating as Edward and Bella.  Edward's love for Bella made you have to book crush on his character as he is so emotionally there for her.  I didn't feel it as strong with Same and Grace although I found Grace a much more likable character than Bella.  No where near as ditzy.<br /><br />My initial plan as I read this book was to come up with a whole pile of comparisons for this review... I was actually excited about it and even thought about a separate post on Sam VS Edward, which maybe... as I read through this series may still happen - but not now and here is why:<br /><br />As I read on and shook off my prejudices, I really started to get into the story line and found it less easy to put the book down and leave it as I had in the early pages.  By the middle of the book I had driven to my local book store only to find out they did not have Linger and not wishing to wait, I ordered it immediately on-line.  I enjoyed the alternating  chapters told in each of the main characters voice.<br /><br />Today, I took the liberty of the holiday weekend to SHIVER under a new blanket from my hubby until I got warm and could LINGER through the end of this book.  I loved that it is set in my home state of Minnesota and I imagine as I am in central Minnesota that I am about two to three hours from Mercy Falls, where Sam and Grace are.<br /><br />In the end, I was really surprised and impressed on how much I enjoyed this read.  I  am looking forward to the arrival of Linger!as he is so emotionally there for her.  I didn't feel it as strong with Same and Grace although I found Grace a much more likable character than Bella.  No where near as ditzy.      My initial plan as I read this book was to come up with a whole pile of comparisons for this review...

0385342055|4|Ok, I agree with the majority that at times Becky's shopping and the craziness she creates gets to be a bit much.  But at the same time, I think that is her charm.  It is the essence of who Becky is, and that craziness is why we fell in love with her in the first place.  It wouldn't be her if she wasn't doing all of the scheming, plotting, shopping, and making her 'People will call her The Girl Who............' statements.  I still find enjoyment in Becky's stories, and will keep reading them as long as Kinsella keeps writing them.
B002QE3CTY|5|My daughter,15,  loves this book. She is now reading the rest of the series. She likes the suspense and the danger that the teenagers face.
B001ANSS5K|5|Great young adult book...loved the characters and felt like I was right there with them. So far I'm loving this author!
B0027MJU00|5|Simply put-an intense and solid story. A page turner. Late to bed just to fin I should reading it and it is a strangely satisfying and unsatisfying ending. No fairy tales here. The best book I've read in a long time. Great character development.
B0025UHKNS|4|Excellent product for runners !!!I recommend without questions!!l A little difficult to manage at beginning...But after some hours you can take care of all.

B000069CWE|5|This Cd is Awesome. No matter what anyone says this cd ROCKS! I love it and Listen to it right after I listen To Hybrid... Everyday! I recomend it to anyone cause it has all sorts of genres of music mixed in one: Hip hop, Techno, Rock, Mellow ect. This is one of thoses cds you have to buy no matter what anyone says just to own it!
B0098VYCCE|2|I don't care for Kristen Stewart's acting.  She acted just like she was Bella in the Full moon movies.  I don't recommend it.

B00BP4Z8XY|4|my kids loved it great movie!
B00436GNVC|1|First, let me say after I first heard Rockferry I became a Duffy fan and eagerly anticipated her next CD. Rockferry is still very much on my iPod playlist and one of my most favorite CDs. With that said, I couldn't be more disappointed in this newest CD. I couldn't get into any of the songs. As some reviewers stated if you were a big fan of Rockferry you may find you don't like Endlessly. This is very true in my case. What happened to that \\"back in the day\\" soulful, R&B catchy sound that I loved on Rockferry? I wasn't looking for a repeat of Rockferry but I really hoped this latest CD would have that old style soulful sound. Sorry Duffy, but I'm going to remain hopeful that I'll like your next CD.
B00H3GZMIE|3|Great CD
B00E8KLWB4|4|This gAme is interesting and addictive!  It is very hard to put down so far.  Looking forward to opening new levels.
B00CWY76CC|4|If you like puzzle games, this one is for you. This game will get your mind and eyes sharp. Great non-violent game for the whole family.
B004SJ3BCI|5|I love playing this game.  My husband and I take turns which makes it even more fun.  When I miss by one, it make me angry myself sometimes though.
B0051ANPZQ|4|Should be ready by all students - middle school and up.  Auggie experiences bullying but he is able to withstand it.
B009NH6AOQ|4|Had a scratched DVD but the season was great.
1400032717|4|I picked up this book on the recommendation of a friend who said it was written in a very \\"interesting\\" manner. The author did an excellent job writing from inside the head of an autistic young boy. The read was both entertaining and enlightening.
B004UJAOLM|5|Gut-wrenching teen angst that turns in to adult angst and is passed on to the next generation. I read it about 30 years ago and loved it and enjoyed it all over again.
B00Y6QF0PE|5|I am sad that the rest of the books are not out yet! I love how E.James describes his part! It's amusing how Anastasia sees a complete side of Grey.
B006LSZECO|3|Interesting and enjoyable except for the ending.
B000002U8I|4|Tina Turner beat the odds with PRIVATE DANCER.  Radio stations and music journalists tend to give older artists half an ear at best.  Thus, superb works like the Everly Brothers' BORN YESTERDAY, Lou Reed's MAGIC AND LOSS  and Ringo Starr's TIME TAKES TIME, to name three stand-outs from the  over-40 bunch, bounced from the bottom of the charts to the cutout bin.  Fortunately for the public, PRIVATE DANCER got deserved airplay and ink,  and the R&amp;B singer had perhaps the greatest success of her career.  As  was the case with the other works I mentioned, PRIVATE DANCER offered songs  about life experience, and who has lived more than Tina Turner?!  Whether  the commands are &quot;Show Some Respect,&quot; &quot;Better Be Good To  Me,&quot; or &quot;Help,&quot; it's more than just words (and music) on  paper she's following.  Get PRIVATE DANCER, songs about life from someone  who lived it.
B004KWVDWI|4|I think this is one of the best films Steve McQueen ever did. Its a compelling story of imprisonment, punishment and repeated escape. Its also somewhat restrained in terms of violence (its still violent at times, but not overly so). McQueen makes the part work through the force of his own personality. Though nominally about a French subject, this is in every respect an American film with American characters. Its true to its physical setting and they do a wonderful job recreating those locations, but its not in any sense true to the culture of that setting.    The film isn't all that much more impressive on Blu-Ray. The whole film seems to have been shot in a soft focus style which results in no dramatic difference in terms of picture in Blu-Ray. The sound is of course better. Its not that the blu-ray is bad. Its no different than the original theaterical experience and it will simply not have the same \\"jump\\" that other titles put on Blu-Ray do.     I have mixed opinions on the blu-ray book format. I like having extras on Blu-rays. But there never seems to be much tnought put into the \\"book\\" part. It always seems to end up being mostly a collection of stills with obvious material about the film presented.
B006YC74E8|5|I don't do many photos on my tablet, but I have played around with this app and have found it to be quite fun.  I've never had any problems with it at all.  It has done everything it stated it was capable of.  I guess I can't ask for more!
B00003CWTI|4|Sure, there's a music video stuck in the middle of it, and yeah, it's pretentious.  But PT Anderson creates engaging scenes and dialogue (watch  Henry Gibson at the bar) and pulls you all over the place.  Guess what?   It's a fun ride.<br />It's possible to be a fan of Altman and enjoy this  movie.  In fact, go watch Short Cuts or Nashville right after watching  this.<br />It's also not for everyone.  It's dark and it meanders and be  advised that it's profane.  That's what the R rating means.  Watch it, then  go check out Hard Eight and Boogie Nights and watch for the same camera  tricks PT Anderson has been using since his first film.  Coffee anyone?
B007MJSSCY|5|Ok, is there a movie where it bombs when Maggie Smith is in it?  I don't think so ... this was a surprise story and very heart-warming ... about a young boy learning about his family's history - knowing where you come from.  This is what I love about Europe - they actually care where they came from - their roots.  The story is told in a fanciful manner!  Watch it!!!!
B001LMAK88|4|Great actors in this movie all in all good movie.
B005K17RU0|5|this app works wonderfully on my kindle!  i get a detailed forecast and everything.  i just wish i didn't have to enter a new city if i travel but otherwise its great.
B0091WNK8M|4|We loved it!  42, 42, 12, & 9 years old.  All good.  We'd watch it again tomorrow!  Don't miss it.
0805091742|5|I looked over the other reviews of this interesting book, and there are many of them that you will find very useful--so I'll just try to list some highlights.  As Dr. Gawande points out, a checklist can't be too long (people won't use it), yet it must succinctly cover the most essential considerations of the situation at hand.  Although what follows isn't a checklist, I'll try to focus on the most essential characteristics of Dr. Gawande's book:    First, this is an easy-to-read, engaging book.  I'll bet that you will find it hard to put down.  It is interesting enough to make you want to read the book and serious enough to deliver important messages.    Second, the value of using checklists springs directly from the complexity of modern life, whether we're talking about surgery (the author is a surgeon), flying an airplane or building a skyscraper.  By the way, in reading this book I have developed a newfound appreciation of how complex the construction business can be.    Third, checklists are not just for simple, straightforward tasks.  Checklists help people communicate and work together better, especially when the unexpected occurs.    Fourth, checklists are important regardless of the time available.  Indeed, when the cockpit crew of US Airways flight 1549 lost both engines over New York City, they had only three minutes of airtime remaining.  The first thing they did was to get out their checklists.  (You can read Captain Sully Sullenberger's excellent book for more details.)    Fifth, checklist usage has saved numerous lives, including one of Dr. Gawande's patients.  His candor in discussing that episode is laudable.    Sixth, humans being human, mistakes will inevitably occur.  Checklist usage is important when the potential cost of human mistakes is great.    Seventh, the mere act of creating a checklist focuses the mind on the most important characteristics of our tasks.    Eighth, like anything else, it takes practice to produce and use checklists effectively.    Ninth, practice comes from commitment and personal discipline.  Indeed, one of the most important things Sully Sullenberger did was to maintain his composure and discipline, even while the gravity of his situation must have been racing through his mind.    Tenth, as I read this book, my mind frequently reflected on how a checklist approach could be applied in some of the business and academic practices that I am familiar with.  That's the real beauty of this book--it gets the reader thinking about ways to improve life.
B00B7FXYJG|5|It would be worth the money to go out by it if you like Batman this one is this DVD of dark Knight cartoon it was really really cool I really liked. I give this a rating of excellent.
0440243688|3|Not as good as previous Reacher books.  Lots of padding -- not as much action.
B00ARHAAZ6|4|Every book that Sanderson writes is filled with magic. He is a true master at creating unique worlds and characters.
B005LN5UOC|5|Awesome headset people online say they can hear me very well
B009KHDT0C|2|I could not into this movie even my mom got up and left the room. I tried again before my 24 hr limit was up but it still did not capture me although I love Johnny Depp. I just could not watch this movie. Maybe I will give it another try sometime.
B000667GFK|5|Even though I must admit I am a huge Luis Miguel fan, I must also confess that not all of his CD's have such a powerfull impact on me as his last piece of work, \\"Mxico en la piel\\". With supreme arrangements, Luis Miguel manages to revive jewls from the past in a sofisticated maner, deffinately, a must have CD, not only for heart felt Luis Miguel fans, but for anyone who appreciates quality music.
B0007LGCB8|5|My husband loves these! He is always wearing them. They are super comfortable and very durable!
B009ZQC7MY|4|It was a good season, I really was not happy with all the death surrounding child birth, but we shall see what next season brings.
B008602KQI|3|This movie was mildly entertaining at best.  I fell asleep, so, I don't know, maybe it was a great movie!
B0058VW36U|5|I bought this for my 3 year old and started playing it with her (she would not have figured it out on her own) and I really enjoy playing it.  Good motor skills for her and logic skills for both of us.  It is a fun way to spend some time together.
B003NFM3JK|5|Well pleased
B000005Z0G|4|2Pac is the best rapper ever. Hands down. No 1 can compare 2 his lyrical talent. I wish he was still alive 2day 2 show people that. Even though he has put out so many awsome records since his death, some people still dont respect him. Like this loser P. Myers who wrote that this album is garbage. U like ZZ Top man! That's garbage! Don't ever disrespect a legend. I can't believe u said that. If u don't like rap, don't review it.  This may not be the best cd 2Pac put out, but nothing he has done has been bad.
B003297I1U|5|Great toy. Very durable. My son loves his crane and the other Bruder toys
B00AFROVQC|5|This is a great start to the series. I didn't have too much expectations but I was extremely pleased with the book. I've enjoyed all the books in the series so far and I can't wait for the next one. Enjoy!!!
B000OVLBGC|5|This is outstanding film both in the superb acting and realistic story.  A little slow at first but picks up after about 30 minutes.  The ending is truly gratifying.
B00005N83M|5|This album is half improved from on the six. The first half of the album delivers strong vocals with catchy beats. The second half differs little from On The Six although is a little improved. The album booklet for this cd was done very poorly. Her lyrics are done in black text on a plain orange background.<br />*indicates J. Lo helped write it<BR>Love Don't Cost A Thing-One of the strongest songs on the cd. This song is catchy and gets stuck in your head easily-5/5<br />*I'm Real-Good beat but the lyrics arent really singable. This is a good dance song-4/5<br />Play-This is my second favorite song on the cd. Catchy beat and great vocals make this one of the best songs. It makes me laugh when she says I just wanna dance. Is that a crime? This is a fun song-5/5<br />*Walking On Sunshine-I like this song.It has a latin beat-4/5<br />*Ain't It Funny-The original version of the Ain't It Funny remix, this song has a Latin beat and is very fast-4.5/5<br />*Carino-This song also has a latin beat. It is the first of many songs that sound like they have some annoying guy singing in them or maybe it is just bad singing by J. Lo but other than that it is a good song-4/5<br />Come Over-This is a slow song that when I heard for the first time I couldn't stand. Now I have started liking it and it is nice to throw in a couple slow songs on the cd-5/5<br />*We Gotta Talk-This song also has the annoying voice but J. Lo's vocals are excellent. I like the lyrics to-4/5<br />That's Not Me-This is one of the weakest tracks on the cd. It is not slow or fast and nothing special-2/5<br />Dance With Me-This song is pretty good but nothing special-3.5/5<br />*Secretly- This song is the other ballad on the cd. Although it is not as good as Come Over it isn't that bad-4/5<br />*I'm Gonna Be Alright-This song also has the annoying voice but is pretty good-4/5<br />That's The Way-This is a fast song but again it has nothing special and it has the annoying voice-3/5<br />Dame (touch me)-This songis a duet with Chayanne and is in Spanish-3.5/5<br />Si Ya Se Acabo-I don't like this song her singing in Spanish isnt very good-4/5<br />*I'm Real-My favorite song on the cd. I don't think she should swear in this though. It says in the album she helped write and puts Ja Rule's name no where. I thought Ja Rule wrote it??? Anyways this song is similair to Ain't It Funny.<br />Production-The production of these songs is nothing special-4/5<br />Design-The album cover is designed very poorly although it does have lyrics in it-3/5<br />Next Singles-Walking On Sunshine<br />Top 5<BR>1. Play<BR>2. I'm Real (remix)<BR>3. Love Don't Cost A Thing<BR>4. Walking On Sunshine<BR>5. I'm Real<BR>Overall J. Lo's album is really good but I am looking for improvments in her next non remix album.
0790729628|3|Having seen the original cut of Blade runner, I recommended it to everyone who mentioned an interest in sci-fi.  However many told me that they rented the movie (director's cut) but couldn't follow it.  Much to my chagrin I  found out why.  The original cut had Ford providing a voice-over that  explained some of culture, environment and   gave insight as to why he  (Decker) quit the force.  So much was lost by removing he voice-over. In  the  director's cut, you're left with the scene of Ford flying off with  Young to live out what remains of  her 4-year lifespan.  The original has  the same scene but the voice-over explains how they beat the system ( and  Olmos ).  Hands down the original  cut with Ford's voice-over would easily  earn at least 5 stars, yet this director's cut was too deep, especially in  the scene where Ford confronts Hauer. This could be an fine example of it's  genre.  As it is, I bought this DVD in the hopes that Ford's commentary  would be there.  Still, I pray that someone will re-release the original  cut on DVD.
B00004RF8J|5|Who thought a 60s B-film by Roger Corman could be adapted into a successful Broadway musical? And who would have guessed that the said musical would be filmed to make a true `80s cult classic?  Surprisingly, almost everything about this film works. The plant himself looks pretty cool and his movements are realistic. He has several funny one-liners throughout the film, not to mention some memorable singing parts. His rough voice (which is oddly reminiscent of a black soul singer) was provided by Levi Stubbs of the Four Tops.   Whoever did the casting for this film was a true genius-Rick Moranis was born to play the nerdy florist Seymour, and Ellen Greene's lisp and high-pitched voice make her perfect for his romantic interest, Audrey. This film also features Steve Martin as a sadistic dentist and Bill Murray as his all-too willing patient. John Candy is hilarious as the talk show host ''Wink Wilkinson.''  And lest we forget the Greek chorus line which appears in several of the musical numbers-they're good enough to have their own musical. Heck, even the homeless bums who sing during ''Skid Row'' are talented.  The songs, which are all done in the style of earky 60s rock and roll, have catchy melodies and clever lyrics. (Seymour: I have so many strong reservations/Should I go and perform mutilations?) Stand out numbers include the darkly funny ''Dentist!'' and wonderfully over-the-top ''Suddenly, Seymour'' (who knew Rick Moranis could sing?)  I, for one, am glad they gave this film a happy ending (as opposed to the original version.) It somehow makes the rest of the film seem more good-natured and light-hearted.
B000002GY9|5|Singing, er, speaking, the blues.  The blues of everyday, down and out, bowery bum existence.  This is the stuff that America, with all its vinyl counters and late-night places to hide from the cold with a hot cup of joe was made of.  Good stuff.  Rick says check it out.
B0083DJUMA|5|This book definitely opened my eyes even further to the new industrial revolution taking place in America. Additionally, I jumped in on two of the 3d printing stocks as I finally fully understood what this technology has the potential to do ... and am very happy with that decision :)
B00ID4I0FM|5|One of the best space movies j have seen lately. Good space movie. Good space movie. Good space move. Need more words.
0060853972|3|I think Sir Terry Pratchett is the best writer England produced in the 20th century, hands down.  And I think Neil Gaiman is also brilliant.<br /><br />Which is why I was a wee bit disappointed in this team effort.<br /><br />The jokes are clever, the characters witty, the satire sharp.. but there was not one character in this book that made me really care about him or her.  Terry Pratchett's work fairly bursts at the seams with three-dimensional human (and nonhuman) characters who are smart, dumb, funny, tragic, solemn and silly -- sometimes all on one page.  Neil Gaiman has a deft touch with human beings--witness the opening scenes of Anansi Boys, where he never actually states that his lead character is a black man, but clues the reader in with tiny details.<br /><br />For some reason the characters in Good Omens never quite make it past the 'well-drawn archetype' stage.  I'm not sure why--it might simply be that GO was an early effort on both their parts, or, as a later edition says, \\"this was written before they were Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman,\\" but were only a newly-fledged SF writer and a young journalist.  In either case.. I have the book, I will probably keep it, but if I had to cull my books I would let it go before turning loose of ANY of my other Pratchett books.<br /><br />Worth reading at least once.
B000002H5I|5|This is probably one of the first albums I heard that I ever really listened to in my life, and I was always thinking how on earth this could be coming from an artist who at the time was barely known? This type of music is rare in CD release, and it is so astonishingly potent, so brutally truthful, and one of the greatest things for Chapman should ever be remembered. Staying out of the spotlight only made me want to know this person more, and I feel I can relate to her a bit through her music. I doubt that ANY artist can reach the harsh reality in here with much success, and I think it was this debut alone that launched Tracy to superstardom. From poetic lyrics to stories of plain life and its painstaking lessons, it is the deep introspection here that keeps me reutrning. My absolute favorites on this are \\"Talkin' Bout a Revolution\\" and \\"Fast Car\\", a couple of the very few songs that I can NEVER get tired of hearing for as hard as I try. All the music here is worthy of listening, and I always used to find myself stealing this disc from my parents to take to school with me it is sooo pleasurable:). My experience here is of great satisfaction and high recommendation to the point of coerce.
B000003CMB|5|the allman brothers band have always been the best southern rock band, and the least political of those groups.  They had a resident guitar god in Duane Allman, who is also famous for being a session musician, and they were famous for their southern style jams on live albums like this one, which is universally considered their best album overall.  terrific guitar work and licks abound, the band pulling off one of the best live sets ever recorded in rock music.  If you are a fan of live music or rock in general, you have to have this.  If you like southern rock you already do; if you don't you can't possibly be a real fan yet (Lynyrd Skynyrd, while good, aren't as classy or classic a band as the Allman's.  You should get both in your collection).  Also get Eat A Peach, their best studio album overall.
B0054JZC6E|4|somewhat fun games. there are a few boring ones, but they can be challenging, and turn into somethings you have to complete!
B003XT60KO|5|Brilliant! Well written and easy to understand.  Makes the usually boring subject of economics interesting.
1567184855|5|In the beginning of this book it's very dry and sterile. This is because the author wants to make sure you understand that he was not a believer in anything before he stumbled across this. I read it twice as it's filled with so much \\"new\\" information to me that I gained an even greater insight the second time around. I've also read the follow up book Destiny of Souls. This book opened my eyes to a greater understanding and awareness of life and it's meanings. I was raised a staunch Southern Baptist and then when to Assembly of God churches. I saw a lot of hate and manipulation going on yet I knew I believed in God and Christ but did really see it in man made religions. I wondered where in the Bible God/Christ said to get Him the finest clothing available..He didn't yet so many of current pastors/ministers, priests etc etc use \\"church\\" money to buy them. NOT in the Bible. They drive around in high priced cars with private jets and limos. Christ didn't ride around in a fancy chariot or wear fancy clothes or shoes. He didn't have men carry him around in a chair on their shoulders like the Pope does. NONE of these people are of God/Christ. Since reading these books and getting a much greater understanding of God/Christ my life is now one of joy and wonder and I pray more now than I ever did and He does love all of us. I no longer attend four walled churches and do not \\"pray in public like the heathen do\\". My life is much richer now than it ever was and I'm not talking money wise.
B00J2VSS0C|4|Fun game, even though it's not always obvious what the final goal is for the game.  Have not spent any money on in-game purchases...hopefully, the game can be finished without spending any money at all.
B00992CF6W|5|this is my favorite but on 0.7.3 it crashes whenever you try to use a bucket on kindle so there's water all over my favorite world and I cant get it away
B004MC8CA2|5|So easy to use! I love it! It is easy to download offline versions. I just wish you could use plans offline
B009AOFNU4|5|Absolutely love this product. Works flawlessly with my mobile devices, and didn't require that much effort with my computer. It is a bit small for me, but I have pretty decent sized hands. Especially with for the price, this is a great controller.
B00AGJ4HC2|5|I really enjoyed this game when I played it for the first time last night. It is very simple while still having enough depth to make it fun. Once everyone knows how to play (and it's super easy to teach) it goes pretty quick. Each turn is just draw one play one so as long as people are paying attention it goes really smoothly.
B004EPZ06G|2|The movie is almost a copy of the first, except that the funny parts are missing. It's like a bad remake.<br /><br />**(Not much of a) Spoiler: Stu's getting married, Alan inadvertently drugs everyone, they wake up not remembering a thing. Chow pops up naked. They figure things out, get to the wedding last minute, Stu stands up for himself, Mike Tyson shows up.<br /><br />Seriously.
B000062YAZ|5|Slayer is one of the most heaviest bands ever and their brutality is headbanging enough for decapitation. This CD is not very long, but is very fast, brutal, wild, and will kick your a$$. I prefer South Of Heaven or Seasons In The Abyss more because of the more structured music and more melodic style, but this is thrash - 100% thrash, pure thrash, a little bit too pure but who ever said that was a problem? About 30 minutes of mayhem later, you will find your neck hurting, or if you are a singer, your throat will be soar like a razor blade cutting your throat. This is a must have for 80s thrash metal.
1484707230|5|Exactly what I wantebd for a gift. Delivery was on time.
B0063GORYU|3|I rated this game low due to the fact that there are too many pop ups. Holy heavens. We all need to get paid but this is ridiculous! Please be more people friendly.
B00NEJ7MMI|5|Absolutely beautiful!
B00HCMG6LG|5|I hate to stop playing the game so much that I even some times have to play while my kindle charges.
B0024FAG6M|5|Don't watch it for the cinematography or the special effects. Don't watch it for the acting, music or costumes.  Just watch it. It was never meant to be a blockbuster, just a low buck art film. It is not a shining example of any of the casts best work, but it has a deep message and is a window to the era.  I suppose if we were living in that era it's avant-garde message would have stuck us and we would have cheered the performance.  Today, not having lived in that era, and spoiled by modern techno-cinema, I missed a lot, but I did see many comparisons and points that were trying to be exposed.  Compare them to today.  I dare you.  After you watch it then run the commentary or the special features and see if your observations were correct.
0802473156|4|Fabulous book! Made me think about love and relationships in a completely different, hopeful, and HELPFUL way. I first borrowed in on my kindle, and then purchased copies for a few close friends and have since recommended it to others.  It's a great starting point to begin to understand all the complexities of any relationship! Thank you Dr. Chapman
B005S9EKCW|5|A beautiful movie that I will watch over and over through the years.  This movie is filmed beautifully and the music is some of the best ever written.
B000002UW1|5|The second of two of the bands finest albums in succession, after Life's Rich Pagent in 1986.  Along with Murmur and LRP, Document is a masterpiece.  It's predecessor, Pagent, was a very upbeat album, with songs like \\"I Believe\\" with its gleeful banjo riff, and \\"These Days\\" with lyrics like \\"happy throngs, take this joy wherever you go.\\"  Document is decidedly darker, though just as vibrant.  <br />There isn't one song on this disc that could even remotely be described as week.  Political commentaries like \\"Welcome to the Occupation\\" and \\"Exhuming McCarthy\\" are gold, and it's sad to think that there are no bands around today who would tackle this subject matter on a pop album - even sadder to think that REM is now one of those bands, now preferring to sing about \\"sugar cane that tasted good\\" and so forth.  \\"Occupation,\\" along with \\"Fireplace,\\" \\"Lightnin' Hopkins,\\" and especially \\"Oddfellows Local 151\\" seem darker than anything the band had explored on its previous albums, other than an occasional \\"Feeling Gravity's Pull.\\"  Most songs, however, still retain their \\"catchiness\\" and hook appeal, other than the completely inaccessible and awesome \\"151\\".  <br />I don't understand people who cry sellout with this album.  To me, a song like \\"Moral Kiosk\\" or \\"Maps and Legends\\" has just as much pop appeal as \\"The One I Love\\".  Hell, \\"Driver 8\\" sounds more radio friendly to me than any song on this whole album.  The band's star had been in full ascention for years, it was just the right time for them to finally crack the top 10.  The \\"mainstream\\" finally realized in 1987 that REM was a damn good band.<br />My personal favorite track is the sitar driven \\"King of Birds.\\"  I've never heard anything like it by any other band.  It's a strange lyric over a marching-style beat, but still catchy as hell.  And of course, right up there with \\"Birds\\" would have to be that quintessential REM showstopper \\"End of the World,\\" still exciting even upon endless listenings.
B00846REIS|5|I was very pleased with this book.  It was very similar to 50 Shades, but still had its own story.  I cant wait until the 2nd and 3rd books come out!!
006092988X|5|This book was recommended to me by my 8th grade teacher. It is absolutly beautiful! It's so easy to relate to, and it is an easy read. I loved it! I would recommend this book to anyone.
B00PTB7B34|5|Really good besides constant frame dropping when deploying units on the battlefield but over all I love this app 5 stars
B000LBB4IA|5|Kids liked it.  Ages 3 and 5.
B0093H8H8I|5|It is a good chip at a good price - it gets the job done, without having to spend a fortune.
B005LAIIKI|5|This is might be my favorite &#34;newer&#34; Tarantino movie. It's a tough call between this and Basterds. The cast rocks it.
0670022950|5|In The Better Angels, Steven Pinker has finally hit his stride and established himself as a true public intellectual.  In what is by far his best book, Pinker makes a compelling case that we live in the most peaceful, violence-free period in history, and that there is a clear long-term historical trend of the reduction of physical violence of every kind and at every level.  What is extraordinary is that, not only does this fly in the face of conventional wisdom, but no one seems to have made this argument or even suggested this before.  The book is long, detailed, and full of graphs, charts, and statistics, but that is because it has to be - for the Conventional Wisdom insists that this claim cannot possibly be correct.  Conservatives believe that society is in a breakdown mode due to the decay of traditional family and religious values; liberals believe that violence is endemic to global capitalism and imperialism; the average person believes the criminals and child molesters are running wild on the streets.  But Pinker demonstrates beyond any reasonable doubt that just the opposite is true. This is perhaps the most important single development in all of human history, and it is simply astonishing that no one seems to have heard of it.  And probably no one else could have written this book besides Pinker, with his brilliance, his willingness to challenge conventional wisdom, and his omnivorous reading habits in many disciplines, from science to philosophy to literature.<br /><br /> Pinker's book sets out not only to document this trend, but even more ambitiously, to give an explanation for it.  And here Pinker is successful as well (with a few caveats, mentioned below). Greatly to his credit, Pinker departs from the standard evolutionary psychology approach (in which we are deterministic &#34;demonic males&#34; and so forth) and ventures to give a sort of explanation that is almost entirely out of fashion these days especially in scientific circles, and that will come across as sentimental softness.  But Pinker makes a compelling case that it is not our instincts, our &#34;mental modules&#34; or &#34;stone age minds&#34; that have caused the decline in violence, but rather our REASON and our MORALITY.  There is, Pinker says, nothing more powerful than an idea (415).  Over time, people have come to develop their rationality and their moral faculties in a way that makes violence no longer an acceptable way of solving problems.  Moreover, government plays an essential role in this process (despite the fashionable conservative mantra that government is the source of all our problems).  By establishing a monopoly on force, the state made the single most important contribution to violence reduction.  And by providing universal education and ensuring that commerce can take place in a nonviolent setting, the state set the stage for ever-decreasing levels of violence.<br /><br />The one pervasive flaw in Pinker's approach is his dogmatic, reflexive bias against religion.  In Pinkerworld, all good things came out of the Enlightenment and the Scientific Revolution/Age of Reason, and everything that happened before then reflects ignorance, superstition, and anti-humanism.  This bias distorts his historical analysis, for instance entirely discounting the influence of Christiantiy.  Like so many New Atheists, he quotes at length from the violence of the Old Testament, but entirely ignores the opposite message of love, mercy, and forgiveness, notably (but not exclusively) in the New Testament.  Jesus is after all the Prince of Peace, and his message is to turn the other cheek, not resist evil, forgive, love your enemy, etc., etc.  One would have thought that this moral revolution might have figured large in a book on the decline of violence, especially as Christianity is the world's biggest religion.  But Pinker dismisses it in a couple of lines, presumably because it threatens his ideological view that nothing good can possibly come from religion.  Similarly, Pinker sings the praises of teh 18th century idea of universal human rights, but almost entirely dismisses the fact that all major religions discovered the idea of the Golden Rule thousands of years before.  However, the thesis of the book stands even despite this bias, and indeed the development of religion in a direction towards nonviolence if anything would only strengthen Pinker's thesis, if he were not so dogmatically hostile to religion.<br /><br />This is a powerful and important book, and it should have a wide influence on public policy debates.  Unfortunately, since politicians get votes by scaring voters about the terrible evils out there (terrorists, criminals, etc), it probably won't get the attention it deserves.  It is also a 700-page tome, and hence most people won't have the time to go through it carefully.  But they should - it is that important.eligion.

B0092S4WLY|5|I absolutely LOVE this game. My only complaint is that I completed all the floors and need the new ones to come soon....really soon. So please hurry and add new ones
B000000NN1|5|The music on this masterpiece is beyond anyone's description. All I can add is the fact that I hope that \\"Heaven & Hell\\" is the last thing that reaches my ears before I pass on ( Hopefully after another million listens).
B00FEMJF6O|4|I enjoy playing this game. I've only been playing for a month. I enjoy it a lot. Haven't has any problems so far.
B004ZMWUCU|5|Very good read.  A story that touches all your emotions.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|As with most any novel, a book can drag, but this book is not all that much. A good story of family, real-life concerns, deceit and truth! I cannot wait to get to the end where I'll know if my theories are correct.
B00K2CHX9C|5|good dvd and fast delivery  thanks
B00003CXBK|5|I found the movie breath taking and I was on the edge of my seat all the way through. I wouldn't recomend it for children 12 and under because of the blood and Gore.
B00000JGOH|5|I felt that Shakespeare in Love was awfully clever and a pleasure to watch, over and over again. I find that, while personally discussing this DVD, that the majority of people who either felt that it was an undeserving  piece of fluff or overrated were those who simply could not/would not/did  not/have not enjoy(ed) Shakespeare no matter which form it was presented.  The dialogue, quotes and plot lines from both Romeo and Juliet and The  Twelfth Night keep me coming back for more.
B004W89N72|4|Pretty nice app could use some small improvements. Really nice faotd. Not really clunky and easy to use worth a dollar but glad it was free.
B002MQYOFW|4|These was a great novel, romance mixed with action. Kept the pace of the story steady. The ending creates wonder!
1616550414|5|I really love this book. I bought it for a friends birthday, and it is definitely worth the money. I had to open it because it looked like there was a huge scratch on the front cover, (it was just the plastic, thank goodness)so i got to read it a little bit before I gave it to him lol. For all the fans out there frustrated that a lot of things in the game series have been confusing, this is the perfect book! It explains the timelines and explains a lot. There is also concept art for most of the games and also a comic at the end to kind of add more explanation to the beginning of skyward sword if i'm correct. This is a very large book, in both size and content.
B0071XO8RA|3|This book was just okay. There were times when the plot was very engaging and it turned into a page-turner, but other sections of the series really lagged. Some plot points felt derivative of other recent science-fiction works, but I appreciated the characterization of the principle characters.  I don't know that I would recommend this one to others, but it's fine for a long train ride.
1469984202|5|This story is one that will haunt my soul; it  encapsulates the human condition and wrecks havoc on our well wishes with little regard to our sense of fair and wholeheartedly explores us at our most desperate and raw.  It is a masterpiece.  My only regret is that it is done and that I may not discover  this magnificence again.  Well written, thought provoking, humbling and an amazing read.  Enjoy!
B008LV8TSU|5|Colorful to a fault, rich and woven; I never expected to like this book so well.<br />Read it. It truly deserves it.
B00E7PQVHK|4|Picked this up for free during Amazon's end of year promo. I've only played through the first campaign so far and have not tried multiplayer - I prefer my games local and single player anyway, so I may not be the target audience. Overall, I like this game, but it's a little bit of a mix.    The art is fantastic to look at. There are a number of tutorials, making it easy to learn the game. And the battle system is neat - I was half fearing yet another match-3 game, but that's not the case.    My biggest criticism is that campaign is very character level-oriented. It seems to me that it's pretty difficult to beat a challenger more than a level or two above yours, since levels are related to your units strength, number of units, and your HP. This means the campaign is a fairly linear series of battles, reinforced by the lack of random encounters and the node-based map. The RPG-ness (so far, but I don't expect this to change) is limited to a few unit stats, a storyline, and maybe some simple map puzzles. It would be better to think of this as a puzzle game than an RPG.    The controls are a close runner up annoyance. I don't want to have to fight the game misinterpreting where I wanted to put my units, I'm already making mistakes myself (almost always because I accidentally formed a wall I didn't intend to - but those are my fault, so I'm OK with them). A better selection mechanism or an undo button or something would be a huge improvement.    One minor thing that could be improved is that for a while I didn't realize you could tap on the map to do something even when there wasn't any character or indicator, and was stuck for a while trying to figure out why the obvious grotto location in the first chapter wasn't advancing the plot.    I was half expecting some sort of IAP since that seems to be the model these days, but it's a pleasant surprise not to be nickled and dimed.    3 stars base for a decent game (though I was a little disappointed since I was hoping for moreRPG based on the Might & Magic franchise and the app description).  +1 star for the great artwork and high quality (though it's sort of to be expected since Ubisoft is big).  +1/2 star for no IAP.  -1 star for frustrating controls - the game won't do what I want once every few battles and it hasn't really changed the outcome, but it's very annoying for a strategy game to not do what you want.
B00N1JQ2UO|5|This movie is amazing in 3D! Very well done movie, I was blown away.
B002MQYOFW|5|This book is wonderful, I absolutely love it!!! There is action,humorous moments, suspense and most of all romance which I guess is why I like it. All in all its a great book and I can't wait to read Catching Fire!!!!!!!!!!
B00KR6332Y|5|Great, great sound!!
B0051QIGP4|4|Let me just start by saying that although I consider myself a little monster but had this album sucked I would have been the first to say. It's amazing! Definitely a lot of upbeat techno-ish beats on this album but I'm not complaining. If you listen to the WORDS you'll understand why I really do love this album. Did I mention it was only $.99...yea that doesn't hurt either. Gaga and Amazon definitely made a great choice & in my opinion are trendsetting for future artist.
B005544TRQ|5|Love it!
B00J8CGU64|1|The world would not have been missing anything if this movie weren't ever made. It was vulgar, disgusting, soft porn, and full of all kinds of drugs. It clearly was stating that unless you did cocaine you can't get rich. What a joke! It was just not needed in today's sick, sick world!

B00JVZ0DQG|4|Nice game to play. Lots of fun.
0316010669|5|A fascinating study of how the mind works and the effects our gut reactions can have on our decisions, \\"Blink\\" hammered Gladwell's point into me in an engaging and entertaining read. The writing is easy but intelligent, and I loved the specific examples and stories, particularly one about the war games. Not only do they help support Gladwell's notion but they're enough to create enjoyable stories by themselves.<br /><br />The main idea I took away? First impressions aren't everything, but they're a lot more than you realize.
B00C1BVAYG|5|Awesome!
B0056CUZRA|5|Great book, flows effortlessly from decade to decade as it follows a family and their neighbours through interesting lives.  The historical content is absorbing and well researched.  Although a long book, each page was well written and held my interest from start to finish.  Highly recommended, particularly for those interested in anglo-saxon history and the class system.
B003XTYDMQ|5|Bc it's amazing. Duh. Why else would I buy it? This series was the best.  I LOVE Logan the most.
0062301233|4|This book is written for college-age and younger men and boys who want to reinforce their hope that they can become great men and change the world.  There are no big words to break their concentration, or insights into social behavior to challenge them.  War and Peace it is not.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the book is entertaining and provides the reader with an overview of Elon’s world.  Details about Elon’s personal life, his marriages and upbringing are touched on, but not elaborated.  Brief sketches of some of his friends are provided, but left this reader wanting much more.<br /><br />The book does provide plenty of names of players in the high risk world of electric cars, space exploration and alternative energy.  But the explanation of the details, motivations, conflicts and resolutions of a mix of highly motivated men and some women in and out of the Elon organizational charts was not satisfying, at least to me.<br /><br />I was disappointed by the lack of technical information about the underlying technologies of SpaceX, Tesla and Solar City.  What technical information there was seemed to ring true, at least to this former machine-designer.  I wanted more, but probably most readers who aren’t engineers and technicians won’t miss it.<br /><br />For what it was, I think Ashlee Vance did a heck of a job.  He made many observations about Elon, the man, which I found interesting though not profound.  The book was mostly a history of Elon and his quest to put humans on Mars while providing green energy and green transportation alternatives to those left behind on the Earth.<br /><br />Sometimes the book had a gushy feel to it that bordered on hagiography, but Ashlee deserves a lot of credit for getting close enough to Elon that he could snatch the information he did from this alert and calculating man-on-mission.
B00BJS7104|5|Blood, guts and comedy.. what more could you ask for?
B000000OAN|5|Top 3 reasons to buy this album: (1) The Prophets Song; (2) It's Queen in their prime; and (3) See 1 and 2.
B00ATDOVNK|5|its good it keeps you intetrested<br />very fun, and makes you want to carry on through the levels to find all the objects
B008673ZAQ|4|Middle book<br />Had to look<br />Just as hot<br />But iffy plot<br /><br />Part two of the three-part series serves mainly to link the opening to the grand (I hope) finale.  Secrets are revealed, even more secrets are withheld, and links with the past keep popping up everywhere for the lead characters.<br /><br />The ending is disappointing in its indecent haste to explain everything and wrap up the loose ends in one chapter.  On the \\"believability\\" scale, it's definitely at the bottom end.  However, the emotion conveyed is visceral and all-consuming, the lead characters still share an unbridled passion for each other, and the writing for these parts is as good as ever.<br /><br />Rated: 3.5 stars<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 3, 2012
B009ZXT4BY|3|This is so unfair at least select some stuff for my the demo and make a lit a lite version

B0054TKAZW|5|Good show, done well.
B005HEVBGG|5|this ia a great  series to watch and has everything that a fan loves in the Star Trek Package. I have seen all these episodes and still enjoy watching them all over again after all these years.

0792151712|4|Overrated by its admirers, underrated by its critics, \\"Titanic\\" is neither a masterpiece nor an abomination, as some have been wont to label it.  What it is, in fact, is one of the greatest anomalies in cinema history--a genuinely stirring, wrenchingly powerful drama, saddled with a screenplay so banal and unconvincing you can't help but marvel at its stupidity.  Never before has so much been wrought from so little.<br />The plot by now is well-known, and far be it from me to waste Amazon.com's valuable space by subjecting you to a recap.  What should be mentioned, however, is that amidst the clichés stands a love story that, against all odds, succeeds.  Certainly, Leonardo diCaprio and Kate Winslet are given some of the script's worst lines, but the sheer strength and likeability of their performances elevates them above the paper-thin stereotypes they have to work with.  It may very well be the acting coup of the century.<br />The same can hardly be said of anyone else.  Side characters, such as Rose's materialistic snob of a mother and her scowling snot of a fiancé, are so wooden that their very presence becomes painful.  Even Kathy Bates, as the \\"unsinkable\\" Molly Brown, can't do much to enliven the proceedings.  And as the now-ancient, modern-day Rose, poor Gloria Stuart is forced to say things like \\"A woman's heart is an ocean of secrets,\\" while Bill Paxton and his crew have nothing to do but look on and pretend that they're actually taking her seriously.<br />But once ship and iceberg collide, \\"Titanic\\" finally kicks into gear, and what follows is both thrilling and utterly devastating--a disaster flick of the highest order.  Director James Cameron is nothing if not a technical and visual wizard, and the way he presents the ship's sinking, documenting a tragedy of unspeakably massive proportions while still managing to tighten the screws on Jack and Rose's situation, is quite brilliant.  Indeed, \\"Titanic's\\" second half is filled<br />with individual momentsthat grip and resonate, and Cameron even manages a few instances of heart-stopping lyricism.<br />In the end, \\"Titanic\\" is a big, dumb, unwieldy mess of a movie that by some undeserved miracle finds a way to soar on the wings of its own excesses.  The script is enough to make even the most incompetent of wordsmiths cringe, but the fact that the film still moves and engages--almost in spite of itself--suggests that it has moved into a realm where words no longer matter.  That's not necessarily a good thing, and it certainly doesn't bode well for the future of screenwriting, but it's an achievement nonetheless.  I suggest that when watching the film again--and it holds up remarkably well under repeat viewings--you try to remember \\"Titanic\\" as it was before the hype blew it to smithereens, before it won James Cameron a pair of Oscars to match his cojones, before Celine Dion's unmitigated screeching drove radio listeners to mass suicide.  Lurking beneath all that unsavory window-dressing is a surprisingly powerful moviegoing experience.

B00P42WROG|5|always read king  no 1 writer have never been disapointed
B009IEXKXI|5|I don't usually write reviews, but this is one of the best books I've read in a while.  The sci-fi is almost inconsequential to the adventure.  I've recommended it to several people who are not sci-fi fans and they all loved it.  Awesome story and excellent writing.  I would love to see more from this author.
B00JNQMKT6|5|Great book and it made a good movie. Book was best of course.
B00B49L7Y4|5|I loved this film and the spirit and soul of Rodriguez - A humble man, and a man of wisdom; many pearls to take from his story (i.e., wealth and fame are fleeting; there's no shame in hard work, etc.); to top it all off, the music is pretty darn good. Highly recommended!
B004EPYZZ8|5|One of the most intense, hard hitting, real, emotional, inspiring, hit you where you live right smack dab in the face movies I've ever seen in my entire life & that's saying alot as big as a movie collector I am. You're a fool not to at least give it try, cause I can pretty much almost guarantee, you'll at least like it, if not, love it. It's your loss if you don't see it. Also, considering this is the first time I've actually taken the time to put in the effort to actually review a movie on Amazon, that should tell you something.
B00H58VGIA|5|My wife read it and all she said she couldn't wait to get back to the book!
0792156684|5|After seeing this movie multiple times, I have to say this movie definitely is a future classic. One of the very few movies that have a good plot to go along with stunning special effects. The characters are very  believable and James Cameron's attention to detail was better than any  other movie in history.<br />I've talked with may people about this film and  I've never heard a bad word said about it... even from the most harshest  critics. Unfortunately, when viewing other people's comments on amazon.com  about this movie, I'm convinced people will never be happy with anything  and will continue to find fault with everything. I believe most people who  claim they don't like it only say they do just to be different. Making over  a billion dollars worldwide, I guess not everyone shares their  opinions.<br />This movie is as close to flawless as you can get.
B00OY0G2LI|1|USB attachment broke the first week, the charger itself only lasted a few weeks more.
B004UID2LC|4|this is a pretty cool app! it can be really slow when it starts to download..<br /> . but other than that i like it! works well on kindle fire Cuzz you can still listen to music even when there is no Internet.
B00MUCX6AW|4|Liked it. For an &#34;action&#34; flick you can connect with the characters well. Good humor too.
B003XF1XOQ|5|I think it was as good as the first book. I wish that all the people that died didn't have to.it will probably will be a two part movie unless they cut a lot out.
B00MNYTWMI|4|Loving this game. The cool downs are mildly annoying, but other than that I like it.
B003UYUP58|4|Very informative, slow going in later chapters, nice recap! Overall it was a book well written, and very  worth reading!
B0045JEPXU|1|I've heard a lot of his songs and I think he has one of the most annoying voices in all of hip hop besides Lil Wayne.  His beats are too stale and repetitive.  It's an ear sore to listen to this crap, Even my wife (who loves hip hop) doesn't like his music much.

B004GJDQT8|5|Amazing experience!
B0001DI0FI|4|This is another great movie from Russell Crowe after such gems like \\"Gladiator\\" and \\"A Beautiful Mind\\".<br /> Unlike many pirate ship movies that portray pirate life as sunshine adventures of fun and happiness fighting bad guys, M&C showcases the true side of what it's like being a pirate or a member of a ship crew during the early 1800s: Bleak, depressing, and uncertain. To me, this is very good.<br /> Some scenes in some areas of the movie were a bit hard to stomach in my opinion but overall, this is a really good movie. This is a DVD worth having.
B00ATPVA78|3|Don't prefer games that charge for hints, helps, extra stuff, especially when the game is free at first.  Would rather buy the game outright.
B007HACDLK|4|Another very good Mitch Rapp story. The story flows well and contains good detail. Rapp makes a great hero, he's real enough but also enough of a superman to keep the story going. i recommend all the Mitch Rapp stories.
B000E97Y6K|3|The film is fantastic on many levels- King Kong looks amazing. I am not so sure about the casting especially Jack Black who I normally love. Kept feeling like he was on the verge of being comical. But what lost me were the long chase scenes with the dinosaurs. Too much too long.
B002JVWR4A|5|My wife loves Bones. Would recommend.
1598561634|4|This same edition of the Hebrew Scriptures is published bound together with the Nestle/Aland 27th edition of the Greek New Testament as Biblia Sacra Utriusque Testamenti. Students interested in both languages should check the web pages of the Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft or Amazon.de to compare prices.
B00NOPQU2K|5|This book had me enthralled from the first page, keeping you constantly guessing who did what and when. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a psychological thriller.
B00000K31Q|5|You just HAVE to see this movie! It's one of the best I have ever seen in my life! Julia Stiles made the person that she played beleiveable! It's cool that it's the same plot as the Shakespeare The Taming of the Shrew. I saw 10 Things I Hate About You over and over! It's THE BEST MOVIE!!!!!!
B004T32SOK|1|A search for dropbox brought me to this app which is not dropbox but similar. I prefer dropbox however since I have been a long time user. Not sure who is to blame for this app getting dropbox's results but I am disappointed.
B001NHNG64|5|Great book start to finish and kept me on the edge of my seat! Never a dull moment. Recommended read.
B001PP9ALY|4|not your typical approach to killing a criminal.  Even though the technique of a bullet to ACTUALLY angle around an object/person to make its target is not realistic...it's still damn entertaining.
B004EPYZP8|4|I went with a friend to see the movie as she had read the books, and I am glad I did! Afterwards I have since read the entire series of books.
B004H4XL7E|5|Very informative! Definitely will help with my sales going forward. A nice change of pace from the usual suspects off sales books out there that just talk about how to smile and dial.
B00425S1H8|5|I use it to control a Celestron NexStar telescope using Stellarium. Works perfectly.<br />Way cheaper alternative than buying a dedicated USB cable for the scope.
B00ALM822K|5|I can't wait to see the movie, it was definitely worth reading and I could read it over and over again a million times.
B00DBSZEH2|4|Taking a radical detour from the original fairy tale, you have a sexy brother and sister turned witch bounty hunters. Using &#34;magiverized&#34; weapons and brute force they encounter a series of powerful and hideous witches and even trolls get in the mix. Well written with just a sprinkle of humor, it's an entertaining film and great escapism.
B00BWYFTNG|5|For anyone who missed grabbing a Daryl Dixon figure from the series 1 release, this is a great and affordable way to get the figure. You won't be able to find a series 1 Daryl figure for under $150 at this point so this is a great buy. The series 1 release of Daryl came with squirrels that he had hunted for dinner, this 2-pack does not come with those as he did in series 1, but he does come with prison keys. That is the only difference from the series 1 Daryl to this Daryl in this 2-pack. Also, the paints apps are much improved over the series 1 Daryl who had some pretty sloppy paint apps. McFarlane seems to have rectified that problem this time around. Also, I really like how slim the box is for this 2 pack, only about 2 inches thick which is great as most manufacturers tend to make obscenely large boxes and this takes up very little room.<br /><br />The only difference from the series 3 Merle to this 2-pack Merle is the color of his shirt. The single issue series 3 Merle has a white shirt, this Dixon Bros 2-pack has Merle in his black shirt. Other than that, the accessories and figure are the same. The box art, the presentation all looks very nice. I am now looking forward to the new Daryl Dixon and Motorcycle boxed set coming out in March of 2014 even more so after seeing the great job McFarlane did with this box set.<br /><br />For anyone who already got the series 1 Daryl and series 3 Merle, you may want to skip on this if you can't find it for under $30 as you aren't getting anything too exclusive other than some prison keys and a different colored shirt for Merle. For hardcore collectors or anyone who missed out on getting Daryl can now finally get him at a reasonable price.
B008476HBM|5|Engaging...wordy, but it grows on you.
B000E1ZK3M|1|I read the book and thought that a movie about Desert Shield/Desert Storm would be interesting. The special effects and photography were great. especially the scenes of the famous destroyed cars and busses of the poor folks who attempted to flee Kuwait and the burning oil wells. The war and the locale is probably pictured accurately but the Marine unit personnel portrayed in the movie didn't act like any of the soldiers, Marines, and sailors I had the privilege to serve with for 22 years. The guys in the movie were a bunch of Hollywood sterotyped animals. They constantly fought among themselves and seemed to have IQ's that seldom exceeded 80. The \\"why am I here?\\" theme for the \\"hero\\" of this wasted evolution goes on and on ad nauseum. It was difficult to have any degree of pride for this collection of disorganized misfits and if this is the Marine Corps of the 1990's and beyond God save us. If you want to see soldiers, officers, and Sargeants as they actually are, please watch WE WERE SOLDIERS.
B005OZE9SA|5|Great Value!
B007J4T2G8|3|I admit my curiosity was piqued when I saw this book ignited such controversy on several of the morning news shows. I also don't normally read romance novels only because I have such a vivid imagination that such books create unrealistic expectations for me. Overall I thought this book did it's job. While it's no literary feat like \\"Lady Chatterley's Lover\\", it entertained but I think more than that it made the reader ask themselves would they want this, what would they do.<br /><br />I'll start with what I like about the book-<br />I thought it was addicting because I was so caught up in Christian Grey's psychological make-up. He's dark and mysterious, but yet on some level I understood him (or at least didn't judge him). I was so interested to see what he would do next (but not so much what Anastasia would do next). I in no way found this book to be about violence against women. I thought the author went through great pains to make it clear to the audience that Anastasia was in control and consented to everything. I do think unbalanced men may interpret this the wrong way and not understand the difference between violence and consent to pain or understanding the difference between hurting someone and causing them pain.<br /><br />The cons-<br />I didn't read about the author first, but it was evident to me several pages into the book that the author must be English. As such I found some of the dialogue unrealistic for two Americans in their early and mid 20's. That was distracting. At times it seems like the book was written by two different authors, as if she realized she lapsed into English culture and suddenly reverted to American.<br /><br />Without revealing too much his introduction to Mrs. Robinson did disturb me a bit, what she did was not legal.<br /><br />The descriptions of their encounters were a bit repetitive, and there is a gross over use of several words (baby, holy, beautiful, etc.) that became irritating. The encounters were described in such a technical manner. I really dislike many of Grey's one-liners.<br /><br />As the book went on I found Anastasia to be utterly annoying. I had hoped that as her character progressed that the writing for the character would progress. But neither happened. She remains very flat for me, however the \\"sub-conscious\\" and \\"inner goddess\\" characters had much more \\"life\\" and I came to enjoy their antics. The descriptions around them were so vivid and not repetitive at all. Unlike the descriptions of Christian and Anastasia. However, I realize that Anastasia is in her early 20's and is bound to be annoying because she doesn't know better. I'm sure I was equally annoying at that age. The way she pushes or approaches the issue are annoying, or at least it's annoying that by the end of the book she hasn't really grown in my opinion. Now that is to say that I don't think all women in their early 20's are this annoying, but Anastasia seems particularly sheltered which lends to her cluelessness about how to deal with Grey.<br /><br />I do think this book is quite expensive in general, but certainly when compared with the quality of the book. Since I noticed the price increased, the publisher is clearly capitalizing on the popularity of the book.
B000002UAO|5|Totally satisfied with this purchase.  A classic - a must have for Beatles fans.
B00FATEJYE|5|The best kindle game ever! Graphics and response are incredible, building a roster and boost/support deck leads to endless possibilities! A must have.
B007FG9LIE|5|Read it in two days, very exciting and suspenseful.
B00785P2QC|5|This game is a great entertainment for younger Kids and older. I love how it shows you where to find things in the beginning. It is a very fun game!!
B00M7URUUE|2|The plot tends to be very contradictory. Visually it's pretty stunning, but you have to ignore a lot of gaping inconsistencies in the plot as it relates to the Christian religion and morality in general.
B00HHJPUFM|3|I loved the first installment. However this left me a little flat. There wer good moments, but overall not as good as the first.
B00015YVD6|5|Great movie!!!
B005GFPZYK|5|I read this book to honor Chris. A very good read.
0345357116|5|Next to The Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales is probably your best resource for learning more about the history and behind-the-scenes events that took place during, and before the War of the Ring. <br /> <br />The book begins with a summery and overview by editor Christopher Tolkien, who as you may have figured out, is John Ronald Reuel Tolkien's son. There's also an introduction, explaining why Christopher Tolkien left some texts unaltered, or why he altered, or did not give altered versions, or definitions and clarifications between differing versions of similar stories...it's all a little long-winded and not entirely necessary in my humble opinion. But perhaps it is important to some. Unfinished Tales is, after all, a large compilation of the scraps and tidbits of information that Professor Tolkien scrawled out in spare time, put together and alongside entire revisions of different stories. I can't imagine the sticky process it took to put this all together. <br /> <br />The book is divided into four sections. <br /> <br />The First Age section entails the story of Tuor, the escaped slave of Morgoth, warned by the \\"god\\" of waters, Ulmo, of the impending danger to the bulwark fortress of Gondolin. Tuor journeys with the aid and guidance of a sea-faring Elf, Voronw, to the stronghold of Gondolin, and offers his message at last to its great king. Since the tale ends here (with only cursory description of the events that followed), I recommend reading The Silmarillion first, if you haven't already, to find out how it turns out. I have, but some of the details were difficult to recall. <br /> <br />Following is the incredibly tragic (and in this rendition, long!) tale of Turin, or rather, Narn I Hn Hrin, the tale of the children of Hrin. I read it because I didn't want to leave anything skipped, but it's only a more detailed retelling of the same story found again in The Silmarillion. It's such a sad, sordid tale that I don't think I would have lost anything by skipping over it. <br /> <br />The Second Age section tells the story of Aldarion, a future king of Nmenr, whose love for the sea is threatened by his love for the maid Erendis, vice-versa. I thought the story was woven incredibly well, except for the fact that it ends abruptly. (I was upset, until I closed the book and remembered that -- duh -- they're UNFINISHED Tales!) From all indications, the ending wasn't too happy anyway. But the story is still of high value for its descriptions of the island of Nmenr. <br /> <br />There is a brief recounting of genealogies of the line of Elros, the first king of Nmenr, and then a scattered gathering of information about Galadriel and her relationship to Celeborn. Various different versions are compared, very little is concretely presented.  <br /> <br />The Third Age is probably my favorite section. It would appear that interest, at least in my case, grows stronger as the time draws closer to the War of the Ring. The first story, The Disaster of the Gladden Fields, is virtually all-new material regarding the march of Isildur after he cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand, how Isildur's army was overtaken by orcs, and how Isildur found his end. There's even a little information about what King Elessar (Aragorn, of course) found in the tower of Orthanc following Saruman's demise!  <br /> <br />Then there is the tale of the great grandsire of the Rohirrim, Eorl, and his assistance that he provided to Cirion, the steward of Gondor, in his greatest need, much as Thoden later did. Unfortunately, this tale tells of how Eorl led his troops forth, and all kinds of details about his journey -- and cuts short just as the battle begins. Don't blame Christopher Tolkien though...it's one of the Unfinished elements. We're also told of the pledge between Gondor and Rohan, and of the gift of the land of Rohan to the Eorlingas. <br /> <br />Then we get some more, extra information about the Quest of  Erebor, where Bilbo Baggins of the Shirewas first persuaded to join thirteen dwarves on an impossible mission to reclaim the great dwarf treasure hoard which was stolen by the dragon Smaug. It is told from Gandalf's perspective to the hobbits inside Minas Tirith following the coronation of Aragorn, which gives it an added bonus, much like seeing extended material on the special extended DVD of the movie. <br /> <br />There are also stories that fill in what happened during the Hunt for the Ring, including a confrontation between the Nazgl and Grima Wormtongue, and the other goings about that the Dark Riders conducted. <br /> <br />The Battle for the Fords of Isen is background, merging with the story in The Two Towers just as Thoden and his troops arrive at Helm's Deep. It also deals with Thodred's death, and the valor that he, Elfhelm, Grimbold, Erkenbrand, and omer and other generals showed during the decline of Rohan's kingdom. <br /> <br />Part four deals quickly with three things: The Dredain (the forest-dwellers briefly seen in Return of the King book, and also the originators of the Pkal-men), the Istari, and the Palantiri. All three fill a mere forty pages, but still provide many interesting and awesome facts about the Seeing-stones, Gandalf's arrival upon the shores of Middle-Earth, etc. <br /> <br />There's also a large index of names and places in the back. <br /> <br />This book is fundamental for hard-core, book-reading fans of Tolkien. You can learn all sorts of behind-the-scenes events that took place in Middle-Earth, and then shock (or repulse) your friends, or just fill out your knowledge of Tolkienology with peripheral information. It's not quite as enjoyable to read as the linear, completed works like the trilogy, the Hobbit, or even the Silmarillion provide, but still very useful. Most likely the fact that you're looking this book up means you should buy it, and I recommend you do.
B00CUG8GAS|5|A very different look at the impact of the African colonial independence and post- independence conflicts told with humor and pathos.
B006ON41FC|3|Kind of like that Dead Runner game that was the faotd awhile ago. Same concept, whether it with paper airplanes, a ghost or a squirrel, this game has been done before. Nothing out of the ordinary. However, I do love these types of games! Very fun
B00BLCHYKU|5|Addictive!!!
B000003N8G|5|Viva Charlie for standing up to the Portugese dictatorship ...not too long ago !!!!
B00F8L2VO4|4|I am learning rather quickly.  I really like it but lesson 1 I was confused when to use Der, die and das for example.  I had to look it up on the internet.  Der is masculine and die is feminine.  I wish they would have explained that.  But so far I like it.
B00E8KLWB4|5|Awesome!!! I really fell in love with this game. My mother and sister play with me. It's challenging but fun. Gotta get it.
B0091XT2VK|5|Good storyline good action. Highly recommended.
B005PK56TA|5|I couldn't stop myself from watching one episode after the other!
0547884591|5|First - this book is a monster - but don't let that scare you off. It is easily read in bit-sized chunks, and is very interesting.<br /><br />When Tim announced that this book would be about cooking - I was a bit disappointed. Personally - I enjoy fine food, but don't have the time or patience for cooking anything more than utilitarian meals. When I learned more about the book - I became intrigued. While it does cover a lot about cooking, the real lessons are around Meta Learning (or learning how to learn) -- which is incredibly useful. How many times have you wished that you could learn something faster or become more effective? This book will help you do it.<br /><br />Not to mention, there are some other really fascinating topics. For instance, I come from a hunting family, but never had an interest in it when I was a kid (instead - I preferred computers, video games and reading -- and later girls). In the past few years, I've become enthralled with the outdoors and getting closer to nature. The \\"Wild\\" section hits hard, in that respect.<br /><br />BTW - I have the Kindle version, since I'm traveling abroad and don't want to lug an extra 3.75 lbs around -- however, I do plan on picking up a hard-copy of this book when I return home. Since it is setup like a reference book (much like the 4 Hour Body) - being able to pick it up, skim through it and flip to specific sections would be very helpful.
B00AE4OGCU|5|Very engaging and hard to put down, lost my self in it a couple of times and stayed up very late to finish
B000001E2W|3|I want to be real honest here; this is not a four or five star album.  I'm a huge Anthrax fan and think this album is a lot of fun.  But four or five stars should be for excellent or essential albums and this just isn't up to that level.<br />Produced to fullfill contractual obligations with Island records, this live album captures some of the fun of the band just prior to Joey Belladonna leaving the band.  So if you want to hear Anthrax live with Belladonna and Spitz, then this is for you.  The first 2/3rds is a live venue in California and the sound quality is merely good - not perfect.  The last four songs are from a live in the studio session for a radio program.  Sound quality is better on these.<br />This is not bad! If you already love Anthrax then don't hesitate!  But it's not a good selection for the first Anthrax album you buy.  For that, I'd recommend, Among the Living, Spreading the Disease, Persistence of Time or Sound of White Noise.
B00BVYLBP2|5|Would give it 20 stars if possible - this is a great series - binge watch to catch up - cannot wait for next season!!
B006GLLXXK|3|too much porn
B00H2EQFBK|4|Characters are intriguing and likable. The plot is deep and addictive. I like how the story involves history and religious beliefs of the Nordic peoples. I will contnue watching the second season.
B000002UTY|5|Classic Filmore West Rock.  Just as good as as it was on vinyl years ago (too many).  Has the longest recorded version of \\"Who Do You Love\\" that I have ever heard.
1607747308|4|This is a great little book.  I was able to open it in the middle, read a little bit and totally get what she is saying.  I then went back to the beginning and read it. I weeded out my books with her method.  When I look at the bookshelf, I feel such satisfaction.  She has a u tube video where she demonstrates how to fold and store t shirts and socks.  I have enough room in my closet to hang my t shirts, but I did redo my sock collection and it is so much better!<br />Christians- I did think she got a little extreme about your stuff giving you joy.  I don't want my possessions or my house to become idols.  But this is a great book to help you let go of stuff.
B00005TT77|5|Being a huge Beatles fan, it didn't take me much to buy this album. The artists and bands recruited for this stunning soundtrack were well picked. Considering how wonderful this album is, it might as well be an unofficial tribute album to The Beatles. Not only did the artists do a faithful rendition of their version of a Beatles song but they also were able to recapture the spirit of The Beatles in the song. Even my least favorite vocalist Eddie Vedder did a bang up job on &quot;You've Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot;. Perhaps that was because he was uncumbered by the distorted guitars of his band Pearl Jam that allowed Vedder to show the listener what he is truly capable of as an artist. I absolutely adored Rufus Wainwright's beautiful cover of &quot;Across the Universe&quot; along with Sarah McLachlan's &quot;Blackbird&quot;. However my very personal favorite track on this entire album is Nick Cave's breathtaking &quot;Let It Be&quot;. Nick Cave is my very favorite male vocalist and his deep, rich baritone voice made the song even more amazing. I loved every track on the album. Not a single dud on here which surprises me since i am not a fan of Ben Harper, Eddie Vedder and The Stereophonics. This collection of Beatles covers is a must-have for Beatles fans. I don't think they will be disappointed in it at all.
B004HX0P2Y|5|Great movie.  Love the action and the comedy intertwined.
B009UX2YAC|5|I love this game, it is so fun and addicting, totally a free app, love this game so much I give it five stars make sure u get this game.
B0089LOG02|4|It was an excellent read. However, when my kindle registered the book as 90% read and my anticipation was high, the book was suddenly over; followed by a excerpt  from another book. I felt disappointed and left hanging.
B000001FAW|4|RIP too Maurice Gibb a Very Gifted Musician.I first heard this album as a kid my mom bought it&I Enjoyed it alot back in the day.\\"You Should be Dancing\\" was Slamming way before it even made it's way too \\"Satuarday Night Fever\\"&whatnot.\\"Subway\\" was the cut as well.I really enjoyed the Harmony,Writing&Production on this Album.
B000O8OTNC|5|Great product.  Small enough to keep in pack without adding extra weight and works well on my boot knife.
B00003CXS4|5|Awesome movie!  Highly entertaining and fun plot line. Mickey is one of my favorite characters played by Brad Pitt. And Jason Statham's commentary throughout just adds to the entertainment.
0553582011|5|just wish the author would come out with the new books already. now I gotta wait 7 more years for the next one!
B0049P1VHS|5|I got this at a great deal during thanksgiving week DEAL of THE DAY, for like 5 bucks, great buy just waiting to get 2 and 3. The package was good no problems, no scratches, looks new and it is lol, thanks again!
B00003XB8K|3|I bought the CD for its hypnotic rhythm and was unpleasantly surprised by the often hokey lyrics.  The entire CD is full of cliches like, &quot;silence must be heard&quot; and &quot;modern crusaders.&quot;  The  incorporation of O Fortuna works in some songs, but for the most part, it  sounds like Enigma is trying too hard.  In all, I'm not thrilled with this  CD.
B0036S4B6M|3|I was always that person to roll their eyes when people made the comment of &#34;the book was better&#34; after seeing a movie. Then I became a reader myself.<br />In this case I wish I had read the book first. I watched the first season of the show on Netflix and LOVED it before realizing it was based on a book, so I ran out and hit up my library. Sadly I found myself skimming through parts that were familiar to me from watching the show. At that point I just wanted to flip to the end to see what happened.
B0063GORYU|4|I love the game but find the adverts quite intrusive
B001KDQ4KQ|5|Sucks you in right from the beginning of the book. Easy to fall in love with the characters and their emotional story.
B006P0FD4W|4|minor plot spoliers<br /><br />I am not a fan of this series. The stories are too slow to build with long scenes of nothing and then the scare is minimal. This movie is the spoiler for the series as we find out from the subtitle \\"It runs in the family.\\" We do get an explanation. This is a prequel filmed in high quality DVD using a VHS camera. The acting was better in this one. Lauren Bittner was convincing as Julie. In one scene she puts on a mask and scares the guys. She is so happy she got one over on them, she jumps around with bubbly joy. Also extremely realistic is young Kristi (Jessica Tyler Brown) who convinces me she has an imaginary friend named Captain Howdy, er ah Toby.  Likewise child actor Chloe Csengery did an excellent job as Katie as she goes screaming across the room.<br /><br />There is a sex scene that is comical. Dennis (Christopher Nicholas Smith) starts out mouthing \\"wack-a-da, wack-a-da\\" porno music and as a romantic sort stampedes right to Julie's chest. There are some strange events going on in the house, so it gets wired for VHS tapes. Now as I recall the longest VHS tape setting was 6 hours (some were 8 hours) which means they would of had to been changed out frequently and viewed for paranormal activity with some scenes lasting for a second. With multiple cameras going 24/7...well you get the idea of how tedious and impracticable this becomes. In one scene the stationary VHS camera is looking at the entire girl's bedroom and then the next second it is focusing on Kristi's bed. While they used the amateur camera for a realistic effect, they didn't stay true to it, which made for a better movie. Maybe one day they will discover how real movies are made.<br /><br />What is not credible is the wife not believing what is going on and refusing to look at the evidence on film. They had to do this so they could keep the constant build up. Dennis filming everything with the camera at grandma's house didn't make much sense. At some point if you are being chased, you stop filming and run. If you are hiding and need to be quiet, you don't keep the camera on. The chase scene is hard to justify filming in all of these types of movies. I felt a little short changed on the ending.<br /><br />Like the other movies, it starts out slowly, but it doesn't sputter and grind its wheels like they did. This is my favorite of the three.<br /><br />F-bomb, no nudity, comical foreplay scene. Was that a 1993 Free Willy stuffed whale in this 1988 movie? Now that was really unexplained.being chased, you stop filming and run. If you are hiding and need to be quiet, you don't keep the camera on.

B00NQWTGZE|4|Not inspiring but very beautiful music
B000FC2L1E|5|I am enjoying the Outlander series and the Voyager, the third in the series, did not disappoint.  Gabaldon's plots are always engaging and take me where I least expect it.  I am trying to cool off a bit until I read the fourth novel in the series though I already have begun to miss my literary friends, Claire and Jaime.<br /><br />If you are new to the series I suggest you read them in order.<br /><br />I have given the books to my mother so we can talk about all the adventures together.  It has been a great way to connect more with my mother.  Young or old, Gabaldon takes us on a fun ride and no one wants to get off when it stops--including me!
B008IJT0CE|5|Love this app! I use it daily
0399255370|5|We received this as a gift and have since shared it with so many others. The story is cute and my child loves it. A real page turner! Highly recommend.
B003Y5H5BA|5|NOTE: I did NOT watch the original TV series, and was not even born yet. However, I'm not so dumb as to miss references to the original and since I did not watch the show (whether that means it was a good thing or a bad thing), they were still funny to me.<br /><br />It's a great movie, though. Jonah Hill is always funny. Channing Tatum not so much. However, in this movie he really steps up for once and you can see he's a pretty good actor. Newly found respect for the guy. Maybe he's got a limit on his emotions, but it all fits with his character here and it's not his usual performance. After seeing this, I could imagine he would be a pretty good fit in some other comedies down the road.<br /><br />As far as plotline, it shares little with the original. If you watch it, you'll see it's more of a modern sequel to the original rather than a remake, so don't be upset that they're just taking the title from it. Which, essentially they are, but it's not frustrating. The story itself is not too incredible, but it's not what makes the movie. It's the way things happen, how people say things, and the characters who progress this story so well. The one-liners are some of the best I've ever seen, very much like Pineapple Express- a great one-liner movie.<br /><br />Another thing about this movie is it's just not a story with characters, but it's basically a parody of, well, society these days. Specifically high school. Between the cool kids being eco-obsessed, studying, tolerant, yet popular shows how kids these days have changed. It mocks the \\"good-old days\\" when cool kids gave wedgies and laughed at losers. With the two main characters seeing the changes first-hand, you can really understand them and the school they go to. Secondly, it mocks cliches in a big way. I won't spoil things, but it puts jokes on car chases, lack of originality in movies, and especially the angry, black police captain. Again, it's not a cliche in the movie, but rather it knows damn well what it's doing and offers a straight-up parody of it.<br /><br />I hear few complaints about it, especially how someone I know (who thinks he's a professional movie critic, by the way) explain how it's just \\"depending on laughs by sticking in the f word between a sentence.\\" Sure, it has some of that. But not in a distracting manner. In fact, I'd say some of the funniest lines are things you don't even notice the first time, like a line in the background or a reference to something earlier in the movie you may have missed. It's written well, and may take more than one viewing to fully understand.<br /><br />Give it a chance. You'll like it. If you don't have an open mind and are not looking for fun or are angry about how it gives 21 Jump Street a bad name, you won't enjoy it. But put it aside for 2 hours and just enjoy the movie for what it is. It's great.
B00L9B7IKE|5|A girlfriend of mine recommended this book for my most recent beach vacation so I went ahead and bought it on amazon, which is at a great price! Anyways, I couldn't put it down when I had the time on the cruise ship and couldn't figure out what was going to happen the entire time. I'm so glad I continued to read, not that I was ever able to put it down, but so many books I just don't finish because I become bored. Paula Hawkins wrote this book so nicely, allowing for the reader to be in the shoes of all of the characters in different times becoming so engrossed in the story. Great read, and if you figure out what's going to happen at the end you might want to go into CSI work!!
B000ICXQXI|4|It was a good movie for its time. I had to watch it for class and it was one of the few that didn't suck.
B00F8H0LM2|5|Great Fun and Free. (The exact same app on my Windows 8 computer or Windows 8 phone would have cost $1.99, each). Which do you think is the better deal? Well, I think this is the better deal, and wish Micro Soft good luck.
B008JFUO0Y|1|nowhere near as good as the original
030788743X|5|I don't write many reviews. In fact, I don't write reviews at all, but having just devoured Ready Player One in a few hours, I felt compelled to.<br /><br />Ready Player One is a geeky book. There is no denying it. Cline tries to explain obscure 80s cultural references and technical jargon. These explanations can be a bit annoying if you're already familiar with them, but I don't blame Cline for trying to make the book a bit more accessible outside of geek circles.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, I inhaled this book in one long breath. The pace was fast though the characters were perhaps underdeveloped. Even so, I think a lot of geeks will self-identify with the characters which makes the book all the more enjoyable. I know I did.<br /><br />As much as I love stories where the future is, well, futuristic, Ready Player One paints a far more realistic picture of a world where oil is outrageously expensive and humanity has escaped into virtual worlds. Crime, poverty and the inventive perverseness of the human psyche thrives.<br /><br />However, this isn't a dark book, but an adventure and a very fun one at that.
B000077VR3|1|This movie has the look and feel of a Disney animation/live action movie. The plot and the storyline are very similar to Disney movies. Even the singing reminds of animation films like The Lion King. This is a kid's movie. The only part I liked is almost at the ending where Satine and the Duke have to 'consummate' their relationship. For the rest it's pretty bland and unsurprising and that counts for photography, story and setting. I recommend Terry Gilliam movies if you want some real substance.
1883217040|5|AWESOME BOOK! A must-have for ALL musicians interested in broadening your understanding of Jazz or any genre for that matter.  I am a Bass Player and find this book to be the best of all the theory books Ive purchased. You WILL NOT be disappointed investing in this book!
B005LF9OCE|5|Season seven is the greatest and himym is hilarious. This season highlights major show changing events with wit and humor perfectly. It's enjoyable
B00N35P5MW|4|challenging and relaxing
B00C8S9W0G|5|Highly recommend.<br />Good read. The whole series. But Mrs.Gabaldon needs to Wright a great finish. Take your make it good.
B00HY7YXIM|4|This series was well written and delivered.  I loved the locations and felt like I was really in the scenes with the actors.  Rebecca and Max had a great chemistry and their love was undeniable.  I would loved to have seen more life between the two before the finality of the show.
B0088W7VNG|5|Liked it
B007SOQBCM|5|Works great on my kindle
B006ZB3V2C|1|I get this message within one minute of starting the app.  It took me five tries to turn the beta sound off after the app cajoled me into turning it on, because of repeated failures, but it made no difference, the app still failed quickly after startup.  I am using an 8.9&quot;kindle fire HD.<br /><br />Given the unreliability of the app, I can only rate it one star.
B005K17RU0|5|works great,weather seems to be just about spot on. I have had no problems with any part of this app.
B004VMUS9G|4|As the title suggests, this app is a great way to keep alarms and time and such.  However, the alarm is startling and annoying, as it is too loud in my house and wakes everyone inside.  On a positive note, the app is very user friendly.  It has abilities to wake with passcodes, draw patterns, and even to solve an arithmetic problem.  Every function is programmable in some way.
B00N1JQ452|5|good movoe
B0002E5O9G|5|Wilkison at his finest and as a long time fan of this telling of the story I feel musically this was the best. I have seen it live 6 times and 2 times with Wilkinson. The 25th Anniversary had some great additions.
B008JMKN4Y|4|I gave this book a 4 just for the fact that I could barely keep from reading it in one sitting. I<br />Although it seemed at times to drag a bit it was well worth it.  The relationship between Abby and Travis was definitely believable due to the fact of how ridiculous the author made this guy towards Abby. Travis was  so codependent of Abby that he did everything that you would think someone who is madly in love would do. Even if it is embarrassing to most people he still did what his heart told him to do.
B00003CWOL|5|Lots of people are saying this film is blasphemous and anti-religious, and that it pokes fun at God.  Do you know WHO says that?  The people who have NEVER seen it and only think it does that because the 700 Club told them  so.  In reality, this film is very well researched and even though it has  some wild parts as far as religion goes, you'll know when it's just a joke.   And when he's being serious about religion, you're sitting there thinking  &quot;yeah, he's right&quot;!  It's meant to be fun and intellegent.  This  is not a Jim Carrey &quot;slap myself in the face 20 times to get a  laugh&quot; kinda flick.  It's smart, intellegent and funny.  But I'll be  the first to say, if you can't laugh (even just a little) at  religion...then don't waist your time (and for that I pity you).

B00E7Z7D2M|5|Robert Glasper caught my eye several years ago and has not disappointed me yet. This album is an underground one which rocks!
B007ZGO7EM|5|The layout is excellent.  Easy to use.  I have used it over 20 times in the last few days.  I will retire my handheld calculator soon!
B009YR74F4|5|Big Clint Eastwood fan and this is a great one
B005LAIHQS|4|It has been a few years but the Men in Black are back for their 3rd movie. Will Smith (Agent J)and Tommy Lee Jones (Agent K) reunite at the sparring duo trying to keep order in the world with our secret resident aliens.<br />I haven't seen the previous MEN IN BLACK films for years but I thought MIB III lack the energy and sparkle of the first two. Tommy Lee Jones seemed tired and maybe that is why they went back in time to have Josh Brolin play a young Agent K. Of course, there was humor in having a middle-aged Josh Brolin say he was 29. Those Men in Black agents don't seem to age well.<br /><br />It is fun to have step back in time to 1969 with all the funky hair and costumes. Hey, who knew Andy Warhol had actually been an agent back then? Funny touch. The film seems to drag on a bit and there just isn't the enthusiasm as in the previous films. Back in 1969 we see that Agent K had a passionate desire for Agent O (Emma Thompson as adult O and Alice Eve and 1969 O) Brolin does a great job of capturing the mannerisms and speech patterns of the older Agent K but the young and older Agent O have no resemblance to each other except for a British accent.<br /><br />Jermaine Clement is delightful and unnerving as the evil Boris the Animal who sets the travel back into time in motion. Boris \\"Don't Call me Animal\\" is pure evil and he may be the one to destroy Agent K and alter the course of history.<br /><br />There is a very special element to MIB III that finally comes to light near the end of the movie. It's worth seeing this poignant and sweet tribute to Agents K and O as a bit of their history is revealed.<br /><br />I have to go back and watch the original MIB. It seems the best to me but maybe because it was the original and so fresh at the time.
B00JP5ONY0|5|Well done, inspirational and funny.
B00HV2KPNW|5|It speaks for itself! It's a funny, whimsical, and beautiful story. My two year old loves it and the songs are great.
B0015ABRE2|1|I can't give an honest review for this product because the seller never sent my product. I love Dexter so I'm sure the DVD is amazing but I guess I'll have to purchase it else where to find out.
B00DR0PDNE|4|This is a great unit, I rated it 4 stars, as every unit I received, seemed to have some scrapes on it. Not sure what that was about.<br /><br />Anyway, for the price, it works great, don't expect anything less from Google. This unit will stream whatever you throw at it, as long as there is an app that works with it.<br /><br />Mirroring feature could use some work, little choppy, but otherwise great.
B002JVWRAE|5|My interset was caught by the Twilight series. When I ordered this \\"Vampire Diaries\\" I really thought I was wasting my $.  Was I ever WRONG. I fell in love with the show.The actors are really better than Edward.  I can't decide which one of the vampiries ( Damon (Ian) or Stefan(Paul))is my favorate.Elena(Nina) has out done herself with her bouble part.   I will follow the series through to the last show..[[ASIN:B002JVWR9U The Vampire Diaries: The Complete First Season]]
B0094BB4TW|1|This app is horrible! It works sporadically. More often than not it fails to load and I'll end up getting a network error message.
B00IEG0JOY|5|A very useful app much needed for kindle
B007EECSFA|4|I certainly could not have imagined the outcome of this novel. Surprised, indeed.Having lived through this era I could relate to the experience of this family.
B000FC2L1Y|5|I love the Outlander series.  They are some of the best audiobooks I've listened to.  I don't think I'd get through them if I didn't have a long commute and if I tried to actually read them rather than listen, because I don't have that kind of time.  The stories are good, the characters are endearing, and the writing is rich and descriptive.  I like a lot of description.  I want to hear what things taste like, what color the clothing is, etc.  If you want something that is elegant and spare, try Hemmingway.  But if you want a rich, detailed story this may be for you.  A bit too much detail in the sex scenes for my taste.  But, all in all, an nice long voyage of a story.
B000002VCQ|5|This is a classic and a must own for any Whitney Houston fan if you only buy one Whitney Houston album in your lifetime buy this one this album delivers so well the singing, the style, and the pitch of her voice so nice and graceful this is a great classic album to own I love this album just about every track on this album is wonderful and is a classic I love this whole album!!!! This is Whitney's first album so therefore it is her debut album and a very nice one!!!!!
B0050DIWFC|5|I would have never guessed the ending. Great read
B004XJRQUQ|4|Overall a great series of books that makes you think about the possible similarities to events occurring in time and place in history.  Could we be headed towards the direction Panem followed.  Let's hope that we remain civilized enough to never have to experience anything like the Hunger Games.
B00005BKZJ|3|Great Movie I have watched in many times A + A + A + A + A + A +
B006ON41FC|5|This is a simple game that is also cute. If you don't like that openfeit thing just turn off your wifi.
B00P596I8Y|1|I have no idea why this film is well rated. It is terrible. The boy and his mom are not likeable and I found myself wanting them to get Babadook'd.
B008Y2FRFO|5|This is awesome, I miss the good old games. I could play all day. just need more coins..try it you'll love it too.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Very entertaining! A game that you will not want to stop playing, I really enjoy the challanges that it creates.
B0000844M8|5|This is a great movie  I saw it years ago and it was worth watching again.  My girlfriend watched it with me for her first time, and she loved it.
145162607X|1|Ugh. I had to slog through this one. It just seemed mired in details that did not advance the story. Is it bad that I enjoyed the author notes more than the actual story? Philippa Gregory is one of my favorite authors and I love her fictionalized historical tales but this one was a miss for me. :
0307592731|3|Propelled by the pain of a recent divorce, the grief of losing a loving mom, and the abandonment of  two fathers, 26-year-old Strayed takes the \\"road less travelled\\" on the 1100 mile path from the Californian Mojave Desert to the border of Oregon and Washington. Hoping to find insight into her problems, or at least personal focus by going from a geographical Point A to Point B, the author submits herself to a grueling, almost masochistic-like pilgrimage. But despite constant complaining about chronic feet pain and suffering blisters and contusions throughout her body, food and drink cravings (Snapple will probably offer her a contract), supply packages not showing up, and dangerous men and animals, Strayed does not veer from her goal.<br /><br />  Beginning with her childhood and the death of her mom, and then moving to her hike with flashbacks to poignant scenes from her life, Strayed skillfully weaves an engaging, gritty memoir over 15 years after the events. The highlights of the book are the colorful people she meets, the random kindnesses she experiences along the way, and the personal growth she achieves in knowing that if she can accomplish this she can surmount anything, and go forward in her life. Unfortunately, however, the book seems purposely laced with sensual descriptions meant to tantalize (for example, she keeps us informed about her condoms, potential paramours, and when she is not wearing underwear) and a detailed loveless, sex scene with a guy she picks up at a bar.<br /><br />  Readers, however, expecting a traditional Christian conversion story like A Walk Across America by Peter Jenkins, because of the words \\"Lost\\" and \\"Found\\" in the title, will be sadly disappointed. The only acknowledgment of God comes when she uses his name with an expletive after her mom dies. The \\"Lost\\" apparently refers to her inability to shake her inconsolable grief, her drug use, her directionless life, and her difficulty committing to a monogamous relationship. The \\"Found\\" in the story seems to mean finding the inner strength and courage to do something very challenging, her purpose in life as a writer, and her stability with a husband and family.  Although the story is rewarding in the sense that a tormented, articulate, young woman finds success as a wife, mother, and author, there is no indication that she ever becomes reconciled with her heavenly Father, or even grapples with this possibility.<br /><br /> In short, her story shows her eventual triumphs in both body and soul on her trek, but leaves the \\"spirit\\" journey largely unexplored.<br />\\"You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.\\"<br />(Jeremiah 29:13)
B0091WNK8M|5|Video streamed smoothly and clearly. Brought back memories from when I was a kid. Even had a bowl of Rocky-Road ice cream.
0316067598|5|A difficult book to put down.  I wouldn't recommend you start reading if you have to get up early the next day.
B004J4WNL2|3|Found a lot of points were just common sense or observations I have already made about people over the years..<br />Many Parts were interesting.
B009HXG9UQ|5|I couldn't recommend this more. Just watch it. Bruce Willis, Edward Norton and Bill Murray make for a wonderful trio.
B00AREIAI8|5|I think this game is good for anyone who likes horses because it teaches you how to take care of a horse, also it is very hands on.
068484267X|3|I didn't finish it. Nuff said.
B00005JLWN|5|Excellent film - Highly recommended - 5 stars - do I make my point?  This film is amazing; full of action; full of exciting, ironic twists; and reminds a person of the book 1948.    Scary though in that it is a mirror of what the recent Department of Homeland Security report said -- anyone not agreeing with the current government is a danger to society.  The original report (as of recent the websites I have seen are watering it down after public outcry - or putting their own words in it to make the position of the document seem less offensive) labels these people as terrorists - read it!  It is there in black and white!  The report specifically mentions veterans as being potential terrorists!  Again - try to find the original copy online - recently the websites are watering it down after public outcry.    In Equilibrium, the personal thoughts and opinions of the individual are seen as a threat to the government head - called \\"The Father.\\"  This leads to the imprisonment of those who do not agree with the established system.     Equilibrium presents us with a fictional society where emotion (hence private opinion as to what is best) is required to be sacrificed by individuals for the (government defined) public good.  This film is a fictional, but harsh glimpse at what history has proven socialism always evolves into.  The reason history has absolutely no record of a non-evil socialistic society is shown in portrayed here.  Mankind has an inherent sense of greed and selfishness.  Therefore, when an authoritative figure is set up to become the entity to distribute everyone's private goods among all society (socialism) - for a state of equilibrium - the fact that, \\"absolute power corrupts absolutely\\" rears its ugly head.    The \\"father\\" in this film is so very typical of what \\"absolute corruption\\" results in: the \\"Father\\" forces his opinions on the masses, and (as in all recorded, historical instances) - allows only himself (and immediate friends) the very privileges he denies the citizens!  The parallelism of this film - although a fictional world not yet existing - to historical accuracy is an amazing parallel to witness.    Equilibrium also accurately defines the human emotions of greed and selfishness to be the cause of war.  However, as seen here, these - always- are also the basis of evil regimes that kill their own citizens!  What a paradox!  This film accurately does show the way to combat these evils is NOT to sacrifice the rights of the individual and \\"spread the wealth around\\" b/c when individuality is lost, then existence becomes nothing but a play-toy for the few who wield the authority.  The citizens become puppets living only gratify the indulgences of the privileged few.     Get it - watch it - feel it - learn from it - be entertained by it - but do not let the truth behind this enjoyable film slip through your fingers.  No wonder I heard so very little about this film in the news media!
B00GMA414S|4|bought it for my little nephew
193609648X|5|Beautifully designed and wonderfully layed out will try a few of these real soon . This book is so wonderful in color.
B00BEZTMFY|5|wonderful story
B004FGMDOQ|3|This book was certainly not predictable.  It is filled with surprises.  I think it will stir the imaginations of young children.
B004PGAQMW|5|This movie was action packed and kept my family's attention. This movie was worth the purchase and my kids enjoyed it.
0140544518|5|One of the funniest children's books I have ever read! My nephew loved it too!
6301978587|5|Streisand's stunning directoral debut still stands the test of time.  The performances, the costumes, the score, and the direction are all superb.  It is clear that Barbra, who lovingly dedicated this film to her late  father, really believed in the story.  Her love and dedication shine  through in every scene.<br />A film that would be perfect for special edition  DVD treatment.  MGM, can you hear me?
B005H0IW6W|5|Daughter Loved it!  She played it everyday since Christmas.  Now I am going to have to buy her another one of his albums.
B0034DGPEU|1|Our Book Club recently read this book - not one of us liked it.  Thought it was based too much on The Help - which was a far better written book.  Nothing new to be learned here - wicked overseer, horrible treatment of Blacks - incest between families, etc.
B001I5M9SC|2|Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  This time it's my fault.  This is the second audio only so called BluRay disc that I've bought from Amazon, not realizing that they produced no video output.  Amazon customer service was most courteous in refunding my first purchase.  Amazon however has not yet indicated on their web pages that such discs are audio only prominently enough not to fool fools like me.  My only excuse is that the music material is so very much to my liking that I ordered it too quickly.  Hopefully, I won't do this a third time.  Amazon could help more.
B002SR2PKG|5|This is a fantastic epic with an ending I didn't see coming at all.  Every character was finely fleshed out, and the town of Derry itself was its own character.
B008JFUQ3O|5|Fast delivery, love the movie!!
B00E8KLWB4|4|This game keeps me occupied while I am bored. The updates great and the are no bugs so far. I recommend this game.

1609611543|5|I had the highest of any blood pressure on the scale, my entire body was hurting, I had that 'fog' memory, couldn't keep a thought, felt like I was dying. When I found out about this after watching Dr. Davis' video presentation, I decided to stop immediately. I started noticing a difference on day one. Day two was even better and it's gotten better ever since. It was as if my body had finally said to me, &#34;ah, finally, I can start to correct myself.&#34; That's what's been taking place with me. 180 degree turn of events. No more high blood pressure, HDL's are normal, no pre-diabetic, no 'fog', better feelings, no more joint pain, eating better, feeling better, and most of all...I lost over 40 pounds in 7 weeks since stopping. YES! It's true, Dr. Davis says it in his book...you will lose the weight by losing the wheat. I didn't have to exercise at all. It just came off. I'm losing about a half pound per day and know my body is getting back in shape where it needs to be. I'll never go back to eating wheat at all. I also stopped eating anything with corn or soybeans. That's me, but everyone is different, but wheat is forever off my menu. The thing to remember is, if diets never worked for you, this will because it's NOT a diet. That's the best part. It's a lifestyle change for the better. Thank you, Dr. Davis.
B00004YTZE|5|The only studio album of Johnny Thunders & The Heartbreakers. The production is somewhat rough, but finally that also is a charm of this music. All songs are great. Especially I would like to mention Pirate Love\\", Can't Keep My Eyes On You\\", Chinese Rocks\\", It's Not Enough\\" and of course Born To Lose\\". Highly recommendable is also the corresponding live album Live At Max's Kansas City\\".
1449415881|5|This is a fantastic way to start every day. Had it last year, and couldn't do without it for 2013!
0739368044|3|How long can this story go on? I feel like we are trapped. The author just keeps going on and on. I just want it to be over!<br /><br />The story continues and if you are looking for this story to end on the last page of this story, think again!
B00Y6QF0PE|4|I know there are many negative reviews about this book. I did,however, enjoy it I have always wanted to know Christians side. This gives you a glimpse at it I do hope she continues with the trilogy. Obviously this is the same story so I am not sure why people would have thought differently. Here we start to really learn why he is who he is. It's a quick read
B00LXLM05I|5|Great game would recommend to any and all people.  Kinda hard to get stars which are important but otherwise great game
B00KBCN9X2|5|Excellent read!
B00G5G7K7O|5|We babysit for a couple of 5 year olds and all I can say is they love this movie. They could watch it every day. They know all the songs and the hand motions.  I must say I really enjoyed watching them watch this film.
B00005JMJ4|4|For a good time, make it Lost in Translation time. This movie is quite good, and is most of all, different from all of the other movies that have come out this year. <BR> Writing the plot would be useless, as you can interpret it any way you want to. Sofia Coppola is obviously more gifted in directing than she is in acting, (see GODFATHER 3 bleacch.) and won the oscar for best original screenplay.<BR> I sincerely liked this movie and the characters in it, you can just watch this movie and fall asleep with your eyes open, transfixed on the tube. <BR> The bonus features really could have been a little more extensive, but they were okay, including interviews between Bill Murray and Sofia Coppola, amongst others.<BR> If you want to see the world from a different perspective for 120 minutes, rent or buy Lost in Translation, you'll be glad you did.
B00942OO7U|3|I  was not aware of this true story.  So I found it very interesting but also wondering how much liberty they took with the truth.  However, overall it was worth watching and good entertainment.
B00GZ0ML4C|5|Some seriously cool segments of battles between the &#34;SON OF BATMAN&#34; and Deathstroke.....what more can a fan of Batman want? DC hits yet another grand-slam with these original movies! Vastly entertaining, fast paced, applaudable voice-over work......with a PG-13 rating. FANS OF BATMAN, EAT YOUR HEART OUT!!!!
B006UG90RM|5|Wow, pleasantly surprised as an old VH fan, don't know why I waited so long to pick it up but glad I did. Band and album sound great, just good listening.
B007VUA7VO|5|I use this all the time. It lets you know how much time you have left for almost every application.
B00011RPB0|4|The deserving winner of the Best Original Screenplay, this film is unlike almost every American film of the past decade.  Sharing more in common with the films of Jean-Luc Godard or Wong Kar-Wai, \\"Lost in Translation\\" marches to its own beat.  And Bill Murrary has never revealed his soul more openly.  A true gem.
B007J4T2G8|4|It's spell binding!! I have really enjoyed reading this book. I really like the complex relationship of Christian and Ann.
B000ZMVAXO|5|So easy to use, so simple, and sooooooooooo rich in sound quality I usually record the tone that it has.
B002IKLZZY|5|My  favorite  movie  of  all time    (well,  I'm  old.....)
B00FZM8Z7I|5|Great movie ever and in 3d it is even better
B00BAXFECK|4|I have a very busy life, so reading is quite a luxury. It is rather difficult to find a book that really sucks me in...the Goldfinch was exactly what I needed! I truly didn't want it to end.<br /><br />Only 4 stars because the ending was terrible. Very disappointing.
B009JZTOG8|4|This is a great show! It really brings all the fairy tales and legends together in one place. Whoever created the idea and implemented it is a genius in fantasy. The acting suffers at times, but not to the extent that the story line suffers. This series is  a celebration in creativity.
B000002B1M|3|Not a bad album honestly. It's an older Nas album, but he was better then. Very pleased with this. But the plastic cd case was cracked when I recieved it.
0756404746|5|I'm nearly done with it and ordered the sequel, The Wise Man's Fear.  The story flows well.  The characters are very well-developed, Kvothe is so fracking likable.
B0055OO4V2|5|Thank you!
B003KRJNBW|3|meh, and I LOVE Denzel... I kept waiting for it to get better
B001EN71DG|3|I have been waiting to get this on DVD for a while. The scenes are remastered and the sound is excellent along with the effects. The shortfall is they changed some of the scenes so this set is not as I remember the original. If you can get over some added scenes and changed endings then you will enjoy this DVD set.
B00LXLM05I|5|fun and intuitive game play.  excellent use of the touch screen.
0385503954|2|This book is overrated.  The opening sections are so slow that I found myself skimming (something I rarely do).  I only stuck with it because of the numerous positive reviews it has received.  The middle section was more interesting.  The book was fairly predictable, except for the ending, which was annoying.
B00GE32RRG|5|Highly recommended for anyone who wants to understand and fully take advantage of the power of the subconscious mind.  One of the best books I have ever read.  Will read again.
B00SH00N3Y|4|I enjoyed the video,
0060555661|2|I attempted to read this book to educate myself a little bit about the finance/investment world... Perhaps not for the novice, it was really hard to get into reading. I gave up and donated the book.
B004U7JYXS|5|Good
B00BVYNSLC|4|Guilty pleasure!
B00F2LKJ4Y|5|I purchased this movie for the kids. They love the movie and I recommend it to others with children or adults with that inner child! Was a OEM movie and not a knock off.
B0094K1MH2|5|Having read the comic books, this movie did them justice. I watched with my son and daughter and they loved it too. It's a movie that I recommend to watch with the kids. At the end, my daughter (10 years old) asked: &#34;When are we watching the sequel?&#34;
B004XJRQUQ|4|So good. Every word read left  me wanting to read more. I as more invested in these characters than any others in recent memory.
B000AGTPUK|5|I sort of wish I had got the Double Disc edition, but what I did get in the single disc edition was and is so magical, I can honestly say I am more than happy with it. <br />The sound is totally beautiful; if you have a theatre sound system at home, this will be a beautiful watch. Every moment is a precious journey into the heart of a world of \\"Believe\\". Tom Hanks and Bob Zemickis must be commended for their roles, and their young actors who voiced that beautiful song done at the end of the train must be commended for such a heart rending performance. <br />The biggest and best step with this journey is decided to get on the train: its a wonderful, beautiful, and sublime experience. <br />
B0033DOIHC|5|This book was great!  I've read many of this type of book and this is one of the best.  I was disappointed when I finally finished the (second book) The Girl Who Played With Fire and can hardly wait for the third one (The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest) to come out.<br /><br />The main character is both entrancing and non-mainstream in more ways than only her tattoo.  I've grown to love her and the other main characters... and miss them now that I'm done with the (so far) published series.  Sadly... only one more left and then they're ended.
B00IRISI42|5|Kept me guessing until the end. Great setup for the next John Puller book with potential that his mother is still alive and potential romance with Veronica Knox!
B00CH87HF4|4|Good rpg for the road or for your lunch break at work or when your bored at night. Requires massive patience if you don't want to spend money in the in app purchasing section, but hey who can complain it's free. I do wish the was a bit more diversity among the enemies and the gear. Still a great game that is fun playing.
B0057R5XRG|5|The reason I love Blu-Ray. The sound is great on this trilogy and I was impressed with picture also. Good to have in the collection.
B009XIXVU6|5|I was hesitant to choose this book having loved &#34;The Kite Runner&#34;. Maybe Hosseini will ruin his reputation I thought. It's true that this latest novel is not as memorable or as intense as the Kite Runner, however, it is true gem and it certainly helped me through some hot summer days. A perfect holiday read.
B009UX2YAC|5|Love love love this game it is super addictive and really fun and never gets old it updates really fast and works great :)
B004YM6JI2|5|First, this gets 5 stars because of speed of delivery and packaging. I happen to love this series also. I started watching season 1 because of boredom one day. Not sure how I obtained it but I had Season 1 and 2. I'm a junkie now and when I like something I don't just go half way I go nuts, so says the hubby. I don't believe in moderation. I bought the other 6 seasons, 2 at a time on a weekly basis. Again, if you are going to purchase a TV series my advice is to buy where the bargains are and Amazon, so far is that vendor. I would recommend this to anybody looking for a great deal who loves Supernatural.
B00003CX5P|5|My son was very excited that he got this movie.
B009UX2YAC|1|How do I update the app because all its telling me is the stupid details and not how to go to the next stage dummies
1589795474|5|I wish I had read this book when I was 20 years old.  A good book with great advice.
B008JFUO4U|5|great movie
B007IXWKUK|5|I Really enjoyed this book as well as the first one. Definitely will pass it on as a must read.
B00SYTTBMC|5|Such a great album. I like it even more than Boys & Girls. This is definitely an album you want to turn on and take in, as an album, not just to cherry pick tracks.. not to say that I don't have my favorites.  Future People, Dunes, This Feeling, to name a few. Give it a listen, a long slow listen.
B00005JMFQ|5|This is a very nice feel good movie. This buy was a replacement as we lost our original copy.<br />I highly recommend this film for it's warm situations and humor. Gotta love Hugh Grant as the<br />dancing PM.
B0089LOG02|5|This book was hard to put down. I didn't realize it was historical fiction before I started reading. Rich characters and storyline.
B00CWVG1Z8|5|I didn't know what to expect from this movie but I really liked it.  There was an unusual cast of stars but the whole cast was fantastic.<br />The supernatural elements worked with the story....100 % better than those in the awful Twilight &#34;quadrilogy&#34;
B000002L80|3|After their debut album, the Talking Heads began building music of excess-- extra musicians, layered instrumental arrangement, polyrhythms, and so on, driven on by David Byrne's sort of all-accepting view of music and in part fueled by Brian Eno's production wizardry.  After an album that was more electronic then organic (\\"Speaking in Tongues\\"), the Talking Heads did a complete about face with \\"Little Creatures\\", presenting an album of essentially stripped down pop music. <br /> <br />Now granted, stripped down pop is not a bad thing-- it's just that the band appears to have surrendered their edge along with their heavy production.  While the music manages to reclaim a bit of that timeless quality that made the first four Talking Heads albums so great, the music is lacking.  From my perspective, I suspect it's because it's a lot more restrained-- the instrumental arrangements are a lot less edgy and Byrne's vocals fall in a comfortable middle range tenor rather than his usual higher, tense vocal. <br /> <br />Truthfully, none of it is BAD-- it's all pretty enough pop music (\\"Perfect World\\"), and the reflections on children on sweet and often quite clever-- albeit goofy (\\"Creatures of Love\\", \\"Stay Up Late\\"), and certainly there's no question that opener \\"And She Was\\" was destined to be a hit-- it's a great piece with a fantastic hook and a great vocal harmony on the chorus.  It's just that most of the pieces are pretty much undistinguished (\\"Walk it Down\\"), and the Talking Heads were never about undistinguished songs. <br /> <br />This album, along with the rest of the band's catalog, was just released in dualdisc format.  The remastering makes that version far more desirable as it sounds fantastic and is worth the extra cost. <br /> <br />Trutfully, had a band other than Talking Heads put this out, I'd probably rate this higher, but the bar was set pretty high by \\"Fear of Music\\" and \\"Remain in Light\\".
B0036S4C6G|4|Funny quirky and thought provoking.
020530902X|5|My well worn copy of Strunk and White has been a constant companion to me the past 30 years.  No MS Word style and grammer editor can ever take its place.  Along with Margaret Shertzer's Elements of Grammar, and the New York Times guide to Editing, this book should find itself a place on the desk of any serious writer even if your accumulated published works only consist of a few well thought out letters to the editor of the local paper.<br /><br />I have recently provided a copy for my home schooled 13 year old to improve his writing.  Its a book that will never go out of style as long as English continues to be written.
B00271DNP4|5|Watch it! Very Good.
B008XX6J4C|5|Great CD!!
B003EEMIV8|5|The truck is very sturdy and met all expectations. My grandson would agree!
B00AHSIQWE|1|I didn't even finish watching the movie, but then, I've never really been into Batman. Take or leave it? Leave it!
B00T40UK20|5|It's great.
B003Y5HWMW|1|So I love the series, I absolutely do.  That's why I figured I would by the blu ray and support it.  However, the blu ray arrived at my house (kudos to Amazon for helping with a minor issue there by the way) and its unplayable on my computer.  Turns out the DRM requires a HDCP monitor and a digital connection.  Now I understand yes piracy is a large issue, but when you make it impossible for people who actually buy the product to use it, that may be a good reason why that way has become a LOT more popular.<br /><br />So the TL:DR<br /><br />Don't purchase this, the DRM is terrible and there is a possibility doing the right thing can come back to haunt you.
B00AEBB8YW|5|I liked the movie better than the original but my DVD came in a case that had the center holder broken so the DVD is  shaking around in the case.  I have had to put it in a paper sleeve which Is hard to keep track of and to keep from getting scratched by the others.
B00003CY0V|4|I liked the premise of this movie, and Travolta plays a good &quot;bad guy&quot;. This movie has Police, Bombs, Bank robberys, Car Chases, Hacking, and many other commonmd things found in action movies. But it has one thing taht most Actioon movies dont have: it was convincing... well almost. It struck me as a DELL Commercial... ALL the pcs even the servers are DELLS that it the only thing that makes it less convincing...
B00015BJ0E|5|One of the better Jazz c.d.'s around.  What a performance by these two great ones.
1410427188|3|Becky Brandon (Bloomwood) is back. With her daughter Minnie now a toddler growing as a partner in shopping. But, Minnie may be picking up some habits from Becky. Her favorite word is \\"Mine\\", she is banned from multiple paces, and that is just outside the house. Combine that with Becky and Luke still living with her parents, (the houses just keep falling through) and Luke now has extra stress at work with a nationwide financial crisis int he works.  So, what does Becky do. She plans a surprise party for Luke for his birthday, even though he has made her promise not to spend money and she has to wear everything in her clothes at least three times before she can buy anything new. Becky tries to plan the party without help, but may have to remember who she can turn to in the end.  I am not sure why I read these books sometimes. Yes, I enjoy them and fly right through them. But, the shopaholic books usually stress me out too. Becky just keeps spending that it stress me out to buy anything or spend money while reading them. I know that is silly, but I get so wrapped up in what the character is doing I take it personally I guess.  Kinsella has built this character well over the course of the books. But, there is no where for her to go and she doesn't seem to learn anything in the plot or through the books. This is another one that she accomplished her goal, but didn't learning anything.  I happened across this book in at the library, so I grabbed it. But, I don't think I would go out of my way to read more of the Shopaholic series. I am hoping to read Kinsella's other books soon and hope those keep growing like her past ones have been better than the Shopaholic series.
B002NTGKSM|3|Movie was cool. Not my favorite animated movie but unique. Kinda creepy though for small children.
B00FEHXCIG|4|Most of the movie Tony stark is romping around Sans armor, but.... the beginning and ending are worth it.
B0091QS88K|5|My daughter loves to play this game and it loads quickly and easily too! I like it because it can entertain her while on the road or waiting for an appointment!
B00JOT3HQ2|5|So... JUMPING into it
B00F87A7HG|5|KOL have always been a favorite of mine.  This album has some fresh new sounds.  It's great for preparation for their upcoming tour.
B0089LOG02|5|Loved this book. So many surprises in it. The characters are so real. I felt like I knew them all. Read a lot of books in my book club but this is my favorite so far.
0300108834|5|A well written and engaging read, but the focus is narrower than the title would suggest.  My 9-year-old loved having this book read to him.  Be aware that the focus is very much on Western civilization, and, presumably due to the author's background, there is a disproportinate focus on the Germanic peoples.  The author makes sidelong glances at China, India and the Americas, but you will have to look elsewhere for a history of these regions.   <br /> <br />With that in mind, I can recommend the book to parents who like to read to their 4th-5th graders, or to good readers at these grade levels.
B00008YJHC|5|SOME MAY SAY THIS IS NOT THE PIXIES SOUND, BUT MY FRIENDS, SINCE PIXIES MUSIC HAS BEEN A VERY IMPORTANT & INFLUENTIAL IN THE POSTPUNK-ALTERNATIVE SCENE, IT'S NOT STRANGE TO ME THEY CAN SEARCH FOR DIFFERENT SOUNDS AND NOT BE A COPY OF PILGRIM OR SURFER ROSA, IMAGINE IF DEPECHE MODE STILL SOUNDED LIKE \\"JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH\\" AND NOT LIKE IT SOUNDS TODAY. <br />LIKE A SONG FROM EDDY BEDDER GOES \\"DO THE EVOLUTION\\" BUT JUST DON'T SELL OFF, AND PIXIES ARE FAR FROM SELLING OFF, THEY'RE JUST EXPLORING MUSIC.
0345451325|5|Personaly, I haven´t realy read the Book ,but I know a lot of people how have ,and all of them agree in one thing, this Book is great.<BR>If your thinking on buyng this Book , then you probably have already heard about the Xbox´s Killer app ,Halo.<BR>This book does not tell the story of Halo, its a prequel to the events pasted on the game, so its spoler free, and sets the mood for the game.<br />So what are you waiting for?Go buy it ,GO GO GO.
B00GKKTZZU|5|I love all of Kresley's books and have been waiting for this one for a long time. If was a great read the whole way through, never a dull moment. Also loved how Kresely had follow up stories to some of the other characters in this book. Can't wait to see who the next book will be on.
B00000K19E|5|The MATRIX creates surrealistic view of humanity verses technology with technology winning out -- or so it seems. The story tells of humans being slaves to living machines, but kept in a virtual world to prevent any  uprising.  Ironically, to tell the story -- new technology makes it happen.   But, it was the genius of the Wachowski brothers, their insight of what to  present, the extra effort of the cast and crew that make the unreal --  real, the impossible -- possible.  Once again, the human spirit endures.
B002ZG98UA|5|Milla is perfect for this type of movie, I love her! She is feminie, yet a warrior, my idol! Don't much care for all the &#34;matrix&#34; effects, but overall, the movie was great, good plots, never know what is going to happen next, and great stars involved! Highly recommend!<br />Paula
B000OCXFCO|5|Let me start by saying that as a huge Megadeth fan since 1988, figuring out which stage of Dave's career I want to listen to when I have the craving for some of this awesome band is a big part of the enjoyment.  Before my short review of the newest creation, United Abominations, let me say this...  I've read many reviews of the band's catalog on here and find it funny how each different album is a bunch of people's favorite while being a number of people's \\"pathetic excuse for a Megadeth album\\".  I have yet to find one I don't like, although one or two took a while to get into (The World Needs A Hero, for example).  To imagine a \\"thrash\\" band with a lead singer without much vocal range lasting into the later part of this decade 15 years ago (while maintaining a certain amount of mainstream popularity), would have seemed insane by itself.  But to be able to distinguish each subsequent album from each other with the limitations this format and vocal style can bring is what makes Megadeth one of the best bands out there still today.  To say what my favorite album isn't possible.  When I want to hear pissed off, drug induced eighties thrash, Peace Sells it is....When I want the best technical speed album ever made, RIP gets cranked.....If it's memories of my favorite high school album, out comes Countdown.....Awesome mid-90's metal with a different edge?  I'm taking Youthanasia or Cryptic Writings out of the rack....Then I remember my favorite under-produced late 80's gem, SFSG..SW.......The beginning?  Killing, it is....And the most bashed album, Risk, definitely has a place in my collection as well.  Of course I can't listen to all these right now, because my current fave, System is on rotation.  Ripping all my CD's to the pc and putting on a \\"Megadeth shuffle\\" gives me 11 hours of the best mix I could want.....ALL OF IT!  Forget the two greatest hits packages, they couldn't put them on 5 CD's, let alone one.<br /><br />After that essay, I won't spend too much time on my actual review, except to say....WE HAVE A NEW MEGADETH ALBUM, and guess what?  It ROCKS!!  Did I expect anything less?  Of course not.  Pleasant surprise having Christine Scabbia (of Lacuna Coil) on the remake of one of Dave's best songs, A Tout Le Monde, for sure!  The rest of the album sounds a bit like a cross between Rust In Peace and The System Has Failed, and it works well.  Awesome riffs and solos once again.  It certainly can't be said (by those who always use the term on here) that Megadeth sold out on this one.  I have yet to hear when they have, but that doesn't matter.  What matters is that as a fan for almost 20 years, to have the mighty Dave Mustaine (with whatever supporting cast he is using) still making the freshest, non-dated music within this potentially limiting genre, is a welcome gift with each new release.<br /><br />This album is another 5 star release from this band that has no equal.....you won't be disappointed if you relish in all of Megadeth's music as I do.<br /><br />Coulda done without the \\"Hey Jihad Joe....We're coming to get you!\\" line in Amerikhastan, though.tual review, except to say....WE HAVE A NEW MEGADETH ALBUM, and guess what?

B007RTAR64|5|This is a beautiful doll, which looks just like the real Katniss. The details are great.
B00IBZ5YKW|5|I didn't think it possible to top the original book, Wonder, but The Julian Chapter is more powerful in terms of profound life lessons. Adult readers will certainly identify with the actions and motives of the characters. It lead to some wonderful conversations with my 12 year old son about why people bully (it takes a different and more sophisticated form in adults, but it's still bullying) and what true remorse is all about.  Great read.  Kudos to the author.
B00992CF6W|4|The only problem is that you do not have red stone, and you can not make things explode. You can place TNT but you can't ignite it. Even when pouring lava all over it lol<br /><br />I understand that there are limitations on tablets and phones, but it would be nice to blow stuff up and create machines on the go.
B00063MBU8|1|that reviewer is stupid along with simple plan. this is crap that was made for the trash can. if you want good punk, indie turn to ANBERLIN, mae,  copeland, senses fail, the academy is.. and armor for sleep.
B004UJAOLM|5|I am sad for anyone who cannot appreciate what, in my estimation, is the greatest novel ever written.  I still remember, like it was yesterday, the trance-like quality that held me captive when I emerged from reading it.  I knew then that I would never again read anything so great, and I never have (and now I'm an old lady)!<br /><br />One reviewer said he could have no sympathy for the main character, the great lover Heathcliff, because he was cruel; but it is precisely this dichotomy in Heathcliff's character that makes him so fascinating.  Though he can, indeed, be wicked, he is capable of both a love and grief so great that it transcends that of mere mortals.  So, if you have no sympathy for him, you cannot help but be in awe. If you are looking for a sensible, more mundane love story, this book is not for you; but if you want to be swept away to the windy Moors on a sea of sublime passion, then do read this masterpiece.
B009ZQC7MY|5|It's wonderful to feel so invested in these characters. The story is simple but the relationships are marvelously complex. Just when we loose a family member, we gain a new one. It just works! I love the streaming - am a binge watcher. I can't imagine having to wait for another episode.
B00BEIYP1W|5|Saw the star rating for this movie and recorded it recently on a free preview weekend on cable.  4 1/2 stars, how bad could it be.  Actually it was better.  Lived thru the 70's but never really watched racing.  Jackie Stewart, Chris Economaki, Mario Andretti, Al Unser... I'm done.  Oh wait Danica Patrick later but that counts right?<br /><br />Back to the movie. Didn't even know this was based on a true story when I first started watching.  And even though I saw the star rating, I was still skeptical.  This was not your typical sports movie with the Hollywood clichés, Rocky music etc.  Characters drew you in to the story.  Very well performed.  You do not have to be into racing or Formula 1 to enjoy this movie. I think anyone will enjoy it.  I sure did.
B00G5G7EXY|2|Movie freezes up on chapter 8
B00A6CT012|5|I have been following the blog for about two years, and always enjoying the insights and advice. I bought the book thinking that it would just consolidate a lot of pre-existing blog posts. I was very wrong. The book is a much more in-depth and thorough look at how to make zero waste a feasible lifestyle.<br /><br />The book is well organized into sections dealing with different areas of the home and life, so there is no need to read it in order. You can just skip ahead to the sections most relevant to you. The author's enthusiasm is evident throughout, and her research is incredibly thorough. She includes a plethora of resources to ease the transition to less and zero waste for anyone willing to try.<br /><br />There are many books about environmentalism, sustainability, and adopting a greener lifestyle. What I love about this one, is that it makes unnecessary looking at statistics and studying the impact of excessive waste in more detail. It's understood that we know the impact is masses. Rather than overwhelm us with this information, the author chooses to focus on practical, actionable advice and strategies for incorporating meaningful changes into our personal lives. Her advice on reaching out to companies and government officials is also thoughtful, simple, and easy-to-follow. It's almost miraculous that a book about a lifestyle change that seems so extreme manages to sound so feasible and not intimidating.<br /><br />There's a lot of great advice here, and I have a feeling I will be rereading and revisiting parts of this book for a long time to come.
B0054JZC6E|4|the games are combination of easy and hard which I like. there are tons of games for everyone. good fun.
B00EEL0LGY|5|Best game I have played.
B00AAQRNQ8|5|I had a Logitech G9X gaming mouse and it broke.  I was looking for a replacement to get me through until it could be repaired, but this mouse is great.  9 buttons and the responsiveness is what you would expect from a more expensive mouse.  The feel and weight is perfect and so far this one has been better than the Logitech.
B00EMAGCJM|4|Really good songs! Especially &#34;maybe your right&#34;!! I never liked her that much but good songs :) I listen to it all the time in my car
B00FAPF5U0|1|Just a money maker for Amazon....so damn adictive and so easy to buy helpers!<br />Now they want more words for my review.....so I could just repeat what I just said.....I wish I had never downloaded this &#34;Free&#34; game....as the old saying goes....there ain't nothing FREE  Hetty
B007SOQBCM|5|I enjoy how well this works when I want to watch streamers in bed.
B003PVPXOE|3|It was an interesting movie, but I was confused on why it was made into a movie. At the end, I wasn't sure why I wanted to watch it.
B00005N5SF|4|You know, when it comes to  big-time over-the-top sci-fi cheeseball, the third season of classic `Star Trek' really hits the spot! In \\"Plato's Stepchildren\\", you've got Spock dancing the mamuschka around Kirk's prone body; Spock showing his `talent' as a singing sensation, and some of the more over-the-top Kirkian heavy-handed monologues out there! Oh yeah, this eppie's also got a midget... or is he a dwarf? I don't know the diff myself. Maybe I'll research the contrasts someday, but for now I'm too lazy, and basically couldn't care less. Oh yeah, let's not forget network prime-time's first interracial kiss-which wasn't nearly as gratuitous as some of Kirk's other liplocks. G-Rod & Company definitely did their best to make this `infamous' moment as subtle as possible!<br />Then there's `Wink of an Eye', where ol' Jimmers catches the eye of Deela, the comely leader of a race of hyperaccelerated beings. It's not too bad as far as third-season `Trek goes, but it does have its silly moments. The over-done `Jim-gets-romantic-with-the-babe-of-the-week' plot element is given yet another showing here. In fact, there's more than kissing going on in this instance- there's a moment where Kirk & Deela are in his quarters, and he's putting one of his boots on! Does that mean...? Hmmm.
B00C1BUYX4|4|Very enjoyable movie.  Probably I cannot add too much to what others have said. I do feel that Daniel Day-Lewis deserved every accolade he received. I really felt like he brought us closer to the historical Lincoln. And Spielberg is undoubtedly a master craftsman. But sometimes it seems a little too contrived and manipulative. I've been here before maybe in Saving Private Ryan or Schindler's List.
B0063IH60K|4|I have been playing solitaire for years on my desktop computer and down-loaded this free on my new kindle. Enjoy the game and it is a good pass time when you have time to just relax and unwind.
B00GSJ9X4Q|5|Great product. Recommended for macbook pro users looking to upgrade their hdd. Fasten the speed triple time the original hdd. Easy to install both software and hardware.
B001IBIHQ4|5|the same guys that did band of brothers pulls another amazing series out of their sleeve. very moving and definitely worth watching
B008JGSM6G|3|I like the game.  What I don't like is that they charge you for hints.  The game was free which is one reason I choose it, but what I didn't realize when I picked the game was that you only get 3 hints then they want you to pay for additional hints.  Don't think that's quit right!
B009UX2YAC|4|Addicting.  Wish it would explain moves,prizes more and how to use them.  There is no place to go foe explanations.  Such as collecting all 20 dragons.  What benefits are they?
B008Y2FRFO|5|Helps me take my mind off problems.  Even though it is not real money, I love to see the. Totals.  Gives me a great break.
B0051ANPZQ|5|Fun writing style delivering a special message. It should be required reading for everyone. Bullies come in all ages and for all situations. Loved the part when the bully made a turn around with his life. We all make mistakes.
B0044XV3QY|5|Sensory overload. An amazing bundle of goods for a decent price.  I'm not even going to mention how many times I've seen this movie..............I don't even know.  Amazing stuff.
B000002G7E|5|Wow. I can't say enough about how much I love this album. This is definitely in my top three albums ever, but I must warn you all, these songs will only be appealing to a very small section of the general public. There are copious amounts of feedback on every one of these songs, and most people will probably find this quite irritating. However, for those of you who do not mind an almost unbearable amount of noise, have I got a treat for you. 6 near-perfect tracks that make up the best VU album ever, and are sure to delight Velvets fans. <br />The album opens up with an instantaneous cry of \\"White light\\" as we are launched into a 3 minute barrage of feedback and jagged production. Don't let this take away from the greatness of the title track, \\"White Light/ White Heat,\\" which combines a commercial rock and roll harmony with lyrics about shooting up  heroin (Such an ingenious contradiction!).  <br />Next, the listener is treated to an eight-minute narrative about a young man who males himself to his girlfriend, \\"The Gift.\\" The story is actually quite humorous and I found myself laughing out loud many times. Meanwhile in the background, a beautiful cascade of instruments jams on for the entirety of the track. <br />If you can survive this far, you get to hear what I believe is the best track on the album, and the most extreme song the Velvets ever recorded, \\"Lady Godiva's Operation.\\" This track features a three-way lead vocal of Lou Reed, John Cale, and Sterling Morrison, who really took it to another level with this. Some lyrics are spoken, while most are sang. Noise is used as a leading instrument, and once again feedback is used profusely. <br />Next comes the most commercially accessible song on the album, \\"Here She Comes Now.\\" While it lacks the lyrical depth of what Lou Reed is capable of, the music is enjoyable and its a delight to listen. <br />After that 2-minute recovery period, the all-out musical assault returns from the first second of \\"I Heard Her Call MyName,\\" and refuses to let up at all until 4 and a half minutes later, when the song ends. There isn't much singing on this song, but the guitar freakout more than makes up for that. This is the loudest, fastest, most reckless song on the album, and is only second only to \\"Lady Godiva's Operation\\" as the most extreme Velvets song. <br />Finally, the album reaches its last song, but don't expect that to mean it's almost over. \\"Sister Ray\\" is a 17 and a half minute straight-up rocker about murder, drugs, transvestites, and everything else your mother told you to stay away from. I can't help but feel its the perfect ending to this wild 40 minute journey that pushes us all to the limit and defines new borders for noise. This album is amazing and I recommend you give it a try. Who knows? After a few plays you may grow to love it.
B0027CSKQU|5|All I can say is that this reissue of one of the greatest records ever released by far exceeded my expections. If you're a vinyl addict, such as myself, and you LOVE this album, the box set is the only way to go. The audiophile that I am will not go into detail about the the subtle nuances you now notice in the remastering, but trust me, it got the much needed boost that was long overdue.    The heap of bonus tracks, the artwork, the DVD that was always of medicore quality prior to this release, are all great. As you can tell, I'm very happy with this release. My ONE-AND-ONLY recommendation would've been to have a higher quality audiophile grade vinyl pressing that stretched the length of the album over two records and not limited to one. Regardless, Mr. Brown and Co. did a wonderful job with the remastering and I recommend that anybody who loves this album to at least purchase the less expensive reissue and leave the box set for the completists, like myself.
B00AK0X5VQ|4|I have a Sprint Samsung Galaxy S3 that normally does very well for it's battery life. As soon as I installed this game my battery life was reduced, probably by about 75%. I love the game, but it SLAUGHTERS my battery. Probably. Maybe someone can help? There aren't many bad reviews for this game so I've gotta believe it's just me. When I reset my phone, even if I haven't played the game at all it says \\"Osmos HD has crashed.\\" Why is Osmos trying to run in the background?<br /><br />The game is great and fun and all, but I can barely afford to have it installed on my phone in light of what it does to my battery!
B0050DIWFC|4|Worthwhile read for sure.
B003CSV7TK|5|Because it is a touching feeling and want to make u feel amazing and exciting! Make you feel alive! Awesome!
006220629X|5|Few books have moved me like this series has. Zafon has created a cast of characters that you truly care about. Since you can read these in any order, I decided to read them in publication order, this being the third entry (chronologically as well). There were few moments that weren't emotionally jarring or touching.<br /><br />You owe it to yourself to read this series. Buy this, The Angel's Game, and Shadow of the Wind now, and be assured that you are in for a literary treat unequaled in today's world.
B0000029GA|5|Nas is one of the best rappers ever. And this is his greatest album. This is the shortest rap album I ever heard, but there is no bad song and Nas's lyrics are simply amaezing. <BR>Nas vs Jay-Z?<BR>Nas of course.

B002Q9VPFM|4|There is no Ultimate Cut in Germany (or Europe in general) so I ordered this box from Amazon.com. Shipping took about ten work days which was absolutely fine.<br /><br />I had read about the Director's Cut on a website and was completely happy with the Ultimate Cut. Some people seem to prefer the movie without \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\" cut in, but since it's the same in the graphic novel I did like it.<br />I doubt I have to say much more about the movie itself: I assume that if someone didn't like it at all he/she wouldn't buy the Ultimate Cut, so of course the movie is great.<br />The box is full of documentaries and extra stuff, until now I haven't even seen everything but keep watching. It also includes a digital copy of the theatrical version - for those who mind to carry Watchmen around an their iPod or something.<br />To me, \\"The Complete Motion Comics\\" was a pretty interesting and wonderful feature. It's also available in Germany but lacks some quality since the German speaker doesn't really seem to grasp the comic's mood. (Besides, I haven't even read the German translation so all I know is the English one.) The original version is spoken well though and I enjoyed watching the comics (although I do prefer reading them).<br /><br />The box itself looks pretty nice, with glossy pictures of our beloved (if so) heroes inside.<br /><br />I think that Watchmen fans should buy this box for it's truly worth every cent. People who aren't too familiar with the graphic novel but like the theatrical version should rather have a look at the Director's Cut. People who can't really accept \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\" cut in should also refer to the Director's Cut.<br /><br />Note that the Director's Cut is NOT included in this box.

0793518326|5|This book is probably the best buy I have ever made. It was in Austin, TX in March 1995, I was almost 40. I did not believe that that was possible. I cannot play by ear, and by the time I bought the book I had had quite a lot of different Beatles music books. They all were given to my friends right away, as this one is really &quot;complete&quot;. It does have several typos, but they do not make it less worthy.<BR>I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in The Beatles music, no matter whether one is a beginner, or a proficient musician.
B00APUQRPC|5|Is it even possible for Clint Eastwood to disappoint?  I thought this movie was incredible.  Just when I think Clint can't do any better than previous movies, bam, he knocks it out of the park.  See what I did there?  I will watch this movie over and over without ever getting bored.
B00IQE4NUK|5|As a huge fan of the band, I feel that Coldplay's Ghost Stories compares very favorably to the band's fantastic history of amazing albums. This album, mellow and varying in tone from light to somber, strikes all the right &#34;notes&#34;: meaningful lyrics, captivating music, and skillful displays of a range of vocal abilities by the band's frontman Chris Martin.<br /><br />Unlike the band's last album (which is my least favorite), Ghost Stories consists of largely placid, heartfelt songs that have really enamored me. Happily, every song is immensely enjoyable, and none should be avoided. Some standout tracks include &#34;Another's Arms,&#34; &#34;Magic,&#34; and &#34;O.&#34; Further, the sounds of the album seem to hearken back to previous albums by the band. For instance, the track &#34;Oceans&#34; seems like it could easily have fit in with Coldplay's first album Parachutes.<br /><br />To describe the messages within the songs, I turn to reference the Classical Roman poet Catullus. Catullus (apparently from his own perspective) writes about the highs and lows of his romantic interest, Clodia. At times, she returns his fervor, while at others she is content with pursuing the attention of other men, prompting Catullus to try his best to condemn her, which he halfheartedly and begrudgingly does. Throughout the album, one encounters songs capturing the arc of such a relationship, such as &#34;Magic&#34; and &#34;Another's Arms.&#34;<br /><br />Commenting on the title of the album, I feel its name shines through at different points. The tracks &#34;Midnight,&#34; &#34;Always in My Head,&#34; and the hidden track following &#34;O&#34; truly underscore this notion.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this album, but I encourage anyone who's interested in it to buy it from Target, which is selling the album with three additional worthwhile songs.

0486282147|4|I have always loved detective and crime mysteries.  In fact, westerns and detective stories are probably the most popular genre in literature today.  This one (The Hound of the Baskervilles by Arthur Conon Doyle) has been one of the most read Sherlock Holmes stories ever written.  This story begins with Sherlock Holmes and his partner Dr. Watson being hired to protect Sir Henry from the legendary curse of the Baskerville family.  The death of several members of the Baskervilles came about because of a mystical hound like creature who goes for the throat to kill members of the family.  This all takes place on the ghostly and spooky moors of Devonshire.<br /><br />I had seen the Sherlock Holmes movie on The Hound of the Baskervilles but the book goes into much greater detail than the movie.  If you like Sherlock Holmes you will enjoy reading this tale.  My only complaint is that is the writting was a little small in this text and the style of English writing by Arthur Conan Doyle takes a little getting used to; nevertheless, once you are into the story it all becomes clear through the expert eyes of Detective Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a very good mystery story that keeps you turning the pages.<br /><br />Rating:  4 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale (Author:  Predator Hunter: A warrior's memoir).

B005PK1G76|5|I was initially looking for a standard cup holder for my McClaren XLR and ran across this item. While sceptical at first the price was so affordable I figured I'd give it a try, besides all of the reviews I read were excellent. And the reviews were right!!! Not only is the holder convenient and sturdy but very efficient. It can hold almost anything and not slide or flip over, its so good I've ordered a second one for my Stokke and am telling all my stroller mom friends about it.
0385539703|5|I've read quite a few of Ian McEwan's books, from the transcendent (Amsterdam) to the ... not so much (Black Dogs, Cement Garden). His most recent books haven't been especially well-received, Solar in particular, which seems as much to do with people disliking characters as disliking the story. I think that this one will be much more popular with the readers, unless you take personal offense to the aspect of the story that has to do with Adam's religion.<br /><br />But, perhaps I should start again.<br /><br />The central conflict of the story is between Fiona, a judge in the Family Court of England, and her responsibility to weigh the interests of Adam, a 17.75 year old child who has been diagnosed with leukemia and needs a blood transfusion to survive. The hiccup is that Adam is a member of a religious sect that forbids such treatments. Most of the story focuses on the decision that Fiona has to make on the behalf of Adam.<br /><br />A side plot involves a conflict between Fiona and her long-term husband, who has decided that he needs to have an affair, mostly because he and his wife have grown distant. He seems to feel that the right way to repair this distance is to leave his marriage behind. Strange logic, but the dude is kind of a fool.<br /><br />Of the people who are going to get upset, most of them are going to do so because Ian McEwan clearly thinks that the decision to voluntarily die because of your faith is ridiculous, and he doesn't really make much effort to hide this. If you're willing to set aside moral judgements about that, you can probably enjoy this book. But if you can't avoid that, you should skip this book, because you're not going to enjoy it.<br /><br />The conflicts that Fiona feels regarding Adam and her husband are never quite repaired, they're simply resolved, in the only way that some things can be.<br /><br />I really think that this is probably the best thing that he's written since Amsterdam.
B0000AM6IY|5|Great

B0009UC810|3|If the powers that be------Hadn't edited this for language (adult stuff) every 30 or 40 seconds, I could give it a 5 star rating.<br />Not even close to the original shown in the movie the theaters. Maybe I can find an old VHS someplace. Disappointing for that reason.<br />If you want to buy it, it is a fun film. Annoying to watch at first, with all the poor editing.

0345413377|4|Like the previous two books in this trilogy, \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" is a mesmerizing read. It draws you in and refuses to let go. The plot was wonderfully interwoven with symbolism and subtle humour, the characters are fresh and lifelike, and the overall writing is almost surreal. <br />So why did I not rate this book 5 stars? The ending. All right, yes, the ending was beautifully written - no question about that. It was, however, a rather weak ending to such a strong trilogy. It was so terribly sad it made me cry, and I was disappointed that Pullman chose to end his series with a whimper rather than a bang. In my opinion, this ending is the coward's way of finishing the trilogy (or maybe I just like happy endings). Nevertheless, it was meant to tug at the heartstrings and so it did. It was, really, unbearably sad, and made me think about what became of the characters for far too long afterwards. <br />The religious part I enjoyed, because it isn't a very popular opinion in the world today. The \\"killing God\\" angle really was very interesting. To everyone who objects to this book for religious reasons, remember: it's called freedom of speech. If you don't like it, don't read it. Be forewarned now that the book presents controversial views of the Church. <br />All in all, a book worth reading. Just be sure to have some Kleenex for the end.

B00GXKVZSW|3|It's very dark, and the dream sequences perhaps a little too long. Mads Mikkelson is downright chilling as Hannibal. Hugh Dancy does a good job, but one longs to lift a little of that darkness off of his soul. It is addictive, which I guess is why I keep watching. Normally I veer away from shows this dark.
B001NSAJ3G|5|What is there to say really. A fantastic album that was ahead of it's time. The use of the full orchestra brings so much to the story and is simply beautiful. A timeless classic!

B000002LEE|4|'I saw the ocean break on the shore' wails Perry Farrell over Navarro's acid-dipped chords while the reckless, pulsating rhythms of Avery and Perkins form a ground-swell of support for what would become an all out assault on all things main stream rock and/or roll.  So was born the first studio recording from Alt-rock fore fathers, Jane's Addiction; and American hipsters everywhere rejoiced as we found our answer to The Clash, Smiths, Stone Roses and about half a dozen other English sub-mainstream rock acts that ruled college radio through the 80's.<br /><br />Stop for just a moment and take in the fact that 'Nothing's Shocking' turns 25 years old this year.  That's a quarter century that we've had to bask, and I mean bask, in what is arguably the best assemblage of alt-rock players the world has ever seen.  Focusing on Farrell's banshee cries on 'Had A Dad' and 'Mountain Song' or on Navarro's decadent, psychedelic fret board manipulation on 'Summertime Rolls' is as easy to do as it is rewarding.  But without the rhythmic reinforced foundation of Avery and Perkins throughout 'Nothing's Shocking' it seems unlikely that Navarro's sky-piercing solo on 'Mountain Song' or Farell's crass, nearly unhinged vocal on 'Idiot's Rule' or snarky tirade on 'Pigs In Zen' would have had the same weight; would have come across with the same unquestionable authority; or would have remained as remarkably timely and current as it has.<br /><br />Commercial suicide?  Jane's Addiction made a drug-addled career out of it.  Between videos that MTV refused to play and album covers that record stores refused to show, it's no wonder at all that this record, despite its richness and depth of left-of-center ear candy, sold poorly upon release.  For many fans who were born at the very tail end of Generation X, this band was defunct before we'd ever heard of them.  Of course that did nothing but add to the mystique and pull of this album as well as its successor.  Farrell and Co. were crowned the ultimate anti-sell outs by my Dr. Marten wearing friends and me and we would have gladly spent two weeks worth of fast food wages to see these four men play together twenty years ago.  They were to Alt-rock what the apple was to Adam.  How's that for a woefully inappropriate reference?<br /><br />So while the pacing of this album is geared (read: skewed) towards the slower, expansive tracks like 'Ted, Just Admit It,' 'Summertime Rolls' and even the beloved alt-ballad 'Jane Says,' it's the riff-based, destructive little gems of 'Ocean Size' and 'Mountain Song' that, for me at least, define this recording. Had the album featured even a couple more tracks of their simplistic, blissful un-pop sensibilities perhaps 'Nothing' Shocking' would have been the break away success that it should have been.<br /><br />Of course it wasn't until 1990, when we were on the cusp of the greatest musical revolution we're likely to ever see, that Jane's Addiction gave us 'Stop,' 'Been Caught Stealing,' and decided to flush seemingly assured super-stardom for lesser side-projects and copious quantities of illicit substances; leaving us with two of the most daring and singular debut and sophomore records of this or any genre.  'Nothing's Shocking' is an absolutely essential recording of the alternative movement and an album that, for nearly 25 years, has rewarded many an engaged listener.<br /><br />Enjoy with brash, triumphant abandon.ultimate anti-sell outs by my Dr. Marten wearing friends and me and we would have gladly spent two weeks worth of fast food wages to see these four men play together twenty years ago.

I personally could have skipped the first 40 chapters and just read Part II of the book.  For me, it was hard getting through those first 40 chapters and I didn't feel they were all that relevant to the story.  Then, the end of the book was just weird for me.  I don't want to give anything away, but if I had to do it all over again, I'd only read Part II.

Nancy thanks him and writes under an alias but after eight years the letters stop and he fears she was found. confessing to everything he tracks down and finds she is now a stripper at a club and realizes...he was set up. now he must protect Nancy from the same lunatic who tried to kill her. i recomand this to any one because it is a great movie, great cast, and is set in the great times of black and white.

0385743564|5|Steelheart is Brandon Sanderson's second foray into the young adult sci-fi/fantasy market, and is set in a world much like our own, with two major exceptions: all profanity has been replaced with new words (\\"Calamity\\", \\"slontze\\", \\"sparks\\") and superhumans known as Epics first came into existence 10 years ago. Unfortunately for the people of that world, Epics have been uniformly villainous and destructive. The narrator, David Charleston, has devoted his life to seeking revenge against the Epic who killed his father. Armed with a savant's knowledge of Epics and firearms, he seeks out the Reckoners, the only group of normal humans who present a serious threat to Epics.<br /><br />Because Steelheart is essentially set in the modern world, Sanderson doesn't need to spend as much time world-building as in many of his other novels, allowing the story to move much more organically. There are still times where the Reckoners or David need to explain something to each other, but they are relatively few and far-between. The principle of Chekhov's Gun is used to good effect, and even extraneous descriptions take on relevance as the story progresses. Finally, while Sanderson leaves room for sequels set in the same universe, Steelheart stands well on its own. It's long enough to tell a full story, and compelling enough that you'll want to read through it in a single sitting.<br /><br />A note of caution for readers at the younger end of \\"12 and up\\" - there are several scenes of violence, most of which are not described graphically. The most brutal is the first one during the Prologue, which is available as a preview if you have any concerns about the appropriateness for young readers.

My heart broke over the utter pain that so many black families had to endure during the time of slavery in this country.  The sadness brought about by families being torn apart felt too real for me at times.  Although I gave this book a 5 star rating, I would change the ending just a bit to bring about a better sense of &#34;happily-ever-after&#34; for readers.
B0058YPG1G|5|This show is so creative and intelligent for TV.  I wish there were more shows like it.  It is right up there with &#34;House of Cards&#34; and &#34;Weeds&#34;
B00IMYSCR4|5|If this isn't how space and space faring really is in this day and age, then it must be a very good approximation of it. I was captivated by it throughout. Since space is so big, even in orbit at similar altitudes, I'm doubtful that debris from a destroyed satellite would rain in such dense patterns. However, it made for a great story. The combination of very realistic movement in orbit, along with the space debris hazard, made this an extremely interesting movie to watch. Clooney and Bullock were excellent. There must have been a ton of CGI involved. I can't say I can tell where the CGI began and ended. Top notch quality there. If you like your science fiction to lean towards realism, you'll love this movie.
B007PT3QOQ|5|I love this game I cant stop playing really I cant stop I wish they had more games like this
B00CZF87TY|5|Great mix of songs in the movie, some stand on their own, some REALLY just go with the movie. Pharrell is Phenomenal on his tracks. Will put this album on heavy rotation on my phone.
B00DL48BM6|5|Great service (for a great movie)!!
B00AZNEW5G|5|Terrific movie
B00GEJYHQ4|3|The case that the vinyl came in is slightly damaged. Uncertain if the vinyl is new or not as this isn't factory packaging.
B00W6XM002|4|challenging.
B004U7JYXS|5|My 14 year old daughter loves the polaroid camera we got and goes through the film very quickly. Hoping this will last her through the summer!!
B00571F26Y|5|An absolute must to read for your health and your family.
B004I1K2NW|4|My hubby loves this movie and now with a teenager in the house.  He was able to share his favorite movie with her.  It even came in Blu Ray.....
1770854053|5|Easy way to explain the process to a toddler. Love that it came in a board book form so she can hold it and turn the pages too. I only wish I could  write in the terms we prefer to use, just so I don't go on auto-drive and read what is written.
B00B0ND67K|5|I was fortunate to catch these guys at a smaller venue in Annapolis MD last summer, and they are a real treat live.  Highly recommend!
B00AG475K8|5|I saw this in the theater when I was 15. Granted I was the \\"target audience\\", it left an impression.  I'm normally not a fan of romance, the 80's, or whiny teen movies, but Some Kind of Wonderful ranks right up there with The Breakfast Club.<br />The soundtrack is available, and for it's time, is actually very listenable with a couple songs that really get stuck in my head.
B004EK91LQ|5|love the movie
B001KDQ4KQ|5|Geez the ending was not expected at all! A greaaaaat book I'd recommend it to anyone! I love it so much!
B00CWY76CC|1|On the first level I could not open the dyawer. Ether it's just me or I'm not doing it right.
B008Q00KEW|3|Its ok.<br />I just prefer &#34;Star Trek: Original Motion Pictures&#34; so much better.
B00C8S9W0G|5|Once again, an incredible journey.  So sorry it ended and can't wait for the next book.<br />I feel that I've learned so much history on the way - an added bonus.
0307588378|5|I think it is one of the greatest mysteries every written.  It also is a good story about a marriage gone bad.  It is also one of the few novels that I have read where the backdrop of the novel is the economic crisis fof 2008.<br /><br />It truly had some original plot turns and is a real page turner.
1451695195|1|The book is well written and much technical description of the brain and body by Dr. Alexander.  I just kept reading on and on in hopes that at some point he would mention the name of Jesus, who sits at the right hand of God the Father . . . but it never came.  Therefore, I will discard the book and not pass on to anyone.<br /><br />S. Lambert
B00005JO1P|4|When I learned of the movie, I attended it not because I'm a country music fan (I'm not necessarily), but because of the performances of the 2 stars. I had read of their instruction time to prepare for their music performances and was intrigued by their dedication to the roles.  After viewing the movie for the 1st time, I was not disappointed!!  Instead I have become a very interested \\"fan\\" of Johnny Cash, and Mr. Phoenix and Ms Witherspoon.  I have since been back to view the movie again, purchased the soundtrack and am eagerly awaiting to add the DVD to my collection.  It also spurred my curiosity about Johnny Cash and am currently reading his autobiography.  If you enjoy music and appreciate the talent musicians have, you will love and appreciate this movie.  Reese and Joaquin deserve all the honors they have received and may receive!!  Great entertainment!!
B0087HT36U|5|its good needs more give me some more please I want it give it now come on do some more already
B003L77G6A|1|I didn't order this product and don't care to.  If it is on my order as so it is wrong and should be taken off.  Now
B00328G4XY|5|I was always under the impression that Jimi had two great albums.Are you experienced and Axis bold as love.However, when Electric Ladyland came to my hands and after hearing it,I found out how great it was.Actually as Jimi's fan I knew the album and I also knew other albums an concerts he had in his catalog.But I used to think:Yeah Jimi had great music but his best work was the first two albums.Now I've changed my mind and I can tell that Electric Ladyland completes the TRILOGY.I'm a big fan of the Beatles and I can tell you that this album competes with the \\"White album\\" and with \\"Wheels of Fire\\" of Cream.I'ts a classic.Talking about this edition.I'm very happy with it.Yes! there is a big difference comparing this edition with the 1997 edition.I have the 1997 edtion I think that it was a good edtion but this 2010 cd/dvd surpasses the 1997 one.The sound is better and it has more presence in my stereo.The art work is great and the dvd documentary is also great maybe too short.I think the documentary is excerpts of the tv program \\"Classic albums\\".I'm going to buy me the other albums of this edition.The first two and Valleys of neptune via amazon because they have a great service.If you like Rock and Hendrix.Don't hesitate.This album and this edition is a MUST.
B00H71PBQ8|5|I love Downton Abbey after I just binge-watched all 4 seasons. I can't wait for the next season. I feel part of the family, lol.
0441172717|5|I once saw a list of Year 8 recommended reading materials. I am not on the whole a snob, but when I saw 'Dune' listed on this, I thought someone had made a serious mistake. I know people of eighteen years upwards who wouldn't get past the first few pages of this truly outstanding science fiction epic. Although I wasn't so impressed with the numerous sequels, (and don't even bother to watch the film unless you wan't a major distortion of the actual story), in 'Dune', Herbert has created an incredibe world with its entirely different culture. I have never found a flaw with this book, and it stands alone in my humble opinion, as the greatest science fiction story ever written!
B00GFOIUVQ|4|Great game all around except the controls, tho a neat idea they're not accurate... Onscreen gamepad would've worked better. But thank you for another awesome epic game Gameloft..ur amazing peeplez... :-)
B00N1HONIO|3|night two feels like night five and power drains when you are not using doors or lights
B002QE3CTY|3|To be honest, I really wanted to get into this book. Based on other books I liked, it seemed like the natural choice. Plus, everyone else likes it!<br /><br />I really felt like the beginning was too slow. Every time I picked it up, the urge to keep reading dwindled.<br /><br />I devoured Hunger Games so I don't know if it's just a different style.
B000002ULO|4|When Flaming Pie arrived in 1997, the critics were hailing it as a major return to form.  I'm not quite sure where this downward spiral talk began---I mean, sure, Pipes of Peace way back in 1983 was sub-par, and 1993's Off The Ground was not earth shattering---but come on, the man was trying instead of just sitting back and going on nostalgia tours as the 'ex-Beatle.'   1989's Flowers In The Dirt was excellent, afterall.  For what it's worth, Flaming Pie does seem to find a newly focused and adamant McCartney, perhaps creating an album that is more intimate than previous efforts, and confronting some personal issues in his lyrics like never before.    On Flaming Pie, Paul is clearly influenced by then recent work on the huge Beatles ANTHOLOGY project, and the leadoff track, \\"The Song We Were Singing,\\" is clearly Paul reminiscing about his days with John, George and Ringo and is one of the best songs on the album.  The album's title track is a great little spoof on the old story McCartney relays in the liner notes: \\"John joked that the name Beatles came in a vision from a man on a flaming pie, coming unto us...you are Beatles with an A.\\"   Even the album's first single, \\"The World Tonight,\\" a minor hit in 1997, finds McCartney in full Beatles mode: \\"The lyrics were just gathering thoughts. Like 'I go back so far, I'm in front of me' - I don't know where that came from, but if I'd been writing with John he would have gone 'OK, leave that one in; we don't know what it means but we do know what it means'.\\"    The rest of Flaming Pie is clearly influenced by his love for Linda, who at this time was in the middle of a very hard fought battle with cancer which eventually took her life in 1998, a year after Flaming Pie's release.  \\"Somedays\\" is one of McCartney's finest late-period ballads and is haunting to listen to today with Linda having passed.  \\"Calico Skies\\" combines themes of Paul's love for Linda with some political commentary, but is far from preachy, and thus again, it's one of his finest late-period pieces.  \\"Heaven on a Sunday\\" features Linda on harmonies, and in a change from previous works and perhaps due to illness, is one of the few songs to do so on this album.  It also includes a great electric/acoustic guitar exchange between Paul and his young son, James.  This song (to my knowledge) is eerily Linda's last appearance on any of Paul's recorded work.  \\"Young Boy\\" and \\"Great Day\\" both continue the traditional ode to family found on McCartney records, and are both heartfelt and enjoyable songs.      The collaborations on this record are Flaming Pie's weakest spots, and would have been better served as B-sides or cut from the album completely.  Paul's encounters with Steve Miller on \\"Used to Be Bad\\" and \\"If You Wanna\\" are dull and boring, and even Ringo Starr's drumming can't save \\"Really Love You.\\"  These collaborative efforts slow down the otherwise rich album, and detract from a song like \\"Souvenir,\\" which finds Paul in full experimental mode once again.     The album does close strongly, with the meditative \\"Little Willow\\" (written for Ringo's ex-wife Maureen, who had died recently after a long illness) and \\"Beautiful Night,\\" a rousing song with Ringo on drums and both Linda and Ringo on harmonies, and orchestrated by ex-Beatles producer George Martin.       Flaming Pie is an album rich in history.  His reconnection with The Beatles through the ANTHOLOGY project clearly reinvigorated him, but the album does have a mournful tone as well due to Linda's illness.  Much like his solo debut album, 1970's McCartney, Paul is playing most of the instruments here (with help from producer Jeff Lynne).  Anytime Paul records this way, the results are usually highly impressive (like on his new 2005 album Chaos and Creation in the Backyard).      Four stars only because the collaborations are unneeded here, but overall Flaming Pie is a thoroughly enjoyable listen and one of McCartney's classics.  If I may quote a previous reviewer here at Amazon, \\"jgarratt,\\" who so truthfully writes: \\"In an age where songs are designed to be money makers, here is an old veteran who does it because it's in his blood.\\"  So true...and well said.    Released in 1997 and reaching #2 on the US charts.
0345409671|2|I have to start by stating that I am a huge Anne Rice fan.  I read the first four books of this series and thought them to be incredible moving, insightful, and a pleasure to read.<br />Memnoch, the Devil was a true disappointment.  Perhaps it was my high expectations, given the previous four books. What appealed to be about Anne Rice was her incredible insight into the human psyche and her ability to capture the depths of human emotions.  In Memnoch, Rice goes off on a very strange tangent by focusing on religious issues of God and the devil.  Although her ideas of good and evil [and heaven and hell] were mildly interesting, this novel had very little to do with the human experience.  I found myself painstaking having to &quot;finish&quot; the book [I always have to finish a book, no matter how bad it is].  I still haven't given up on Anne Rice and hope Vampire Armand will redeem her.
B002DOSBMK|5|There was a time in my life I was very depressed for many reasons. In that time I found these books when my then-employer started stocking these in the shelves. I'd always been a fantasy fan and I wasn't aware of the novel that was being released (A new Drizzt novel I can't recall now.) but I saw the cover and my first response was to start readng. When I finished the whole series naturally my first response was to buy the latest release and throught the years I've only grown to enjoy Drizzt more and see the wisdom in his letters before the next chapter. It was one of the things that helped bring me out of depression with a hero who sometimes get treated terribly but finds his own peace of mind by continuing to keep going and sticking to what he belives is right. I'm not a hero myself but the books are definatly worth reading.
B000001FOL|5|I love this CD. I'm a big Velvet Underground fan, and if you're a huge fan of their first album and enjoy hearing Nico's voice (which a lot of people don't), you'll love this album. The music is just beautiful and poignant, and you won't be disappointed.
B0071XO8RA|5|I am still thoroughly enjoying this book. I have not yet finished it but I can hardly stand to put it down. I will be reading the next series afterwards, and I really hope they make a movie of this book.<br /><br />I have already recommended it to all of my friends.
B0054JZC6E|5|this app is great.. lots of game that you actually have build up on to get with goals that are reachable but not to easy. original game make it fun!
B00AA0TJO8|4|My grandson plays this so this is his review. I think it should have a health bar to tell u if u r about to die or not. Other wise it is a good game and fun to play.
B0060D3B5M|5|I rediscovered this movie from my childhood in college. It was the perfect length to watch in between my Tuesday/Thursday classes since it was less than an hour and a half long. I watched it once, laughed and smiled the entire time and after my next class I dragged my girlfriend and another friend to watch it as well. That night I got a call from my friend who had more friends he wanted to show the movie to. This word of mouth chain continued for months and I have probably now watched the movie over a hundred times. Every time the movie is hilarious and causes me to smile constantly throughout.<br /><br />I am now out of school, married to that girl and we have a daughter. I plan on showing this movie to our daughter and any other children we have for as long as they'll let me.<br /><br />Why is this movie so good? Aside from the catchy songs and classic Disney Goofy, the themes of teenage social pressure and the gulf between parents and children are timeless. I am convinced that the people who worked on this movie used it as their avenue for some very high brow film concepts too. I have watched this movie with film majors who have watched in awe while rattling off all their film major vocabulary like mise en scene and comments about perspective and camera angles. Little jokes that I never caught during previous viewings that different friends noticed. (The father of one characters in the movie is a bulldog with a crew cut who does nothing but grunt and a friend whose parents were in the military shouts out, &#34;That dad's a Marine!&#34;)<br /><br />Can't recommend enough.
B004EPYZPS|5|It's rare that a film comes along about kids and has a science fiction touch yet communicates the joys and the frustrations of growing up than Super 8.<br /><br />Super 8 was apparently billed as a disaster film with aliens, etc. In truth, it's not about the alien at all. It's about kids growing up in a rural town, trying to do something special with themselves.<br /><br />My Impressions:<br /><br />The film starts out with a funeral. A child loses his mother early on. A man comes over and is immediately thrown out of the house! Right here you wonder what the heck is going on!<br /><br />We find out soon enough. I think I found the story within the story of what Abrams was trying to do. It's semi-autobiographical. Spielberg and Abrams were both into making films as kids and it stuck.<br /><br />The actual filmmaking was fun to see: they set up with funky scripts, a zombie who just would not stay dead, and a kid who wanted \\"production value\\" in all his shots! However, a train wreck, a fallen camera and an Area 51 scientist who also happened to be their science teacher changed all that.<br /><br />The train wreck special effects were amazing and horrific. The look on the love-struck kid when he thought Alice was dead was heart-touching.<br /><br />Favorite Scenes:<br /><br />Father's Faith:<br /><br />Without giving too much away, our hero discovers a film that was made with his mother when he was growing up. Alice sits with him in his room as the power comes on. The scenes project and Alice begins to cry, realizing that if her father took that shift at the steel mill that day, the tragic accident that took his mother \\"should have\\" taken her father.<br /><br />The theme of dysfunctional parents that actually do love their children and overcoming that dysfunctional was great to see.<br /><br />Amateur Horror Film:<br /><br />During the credits we actually get to see the full film that the kids were making, right down to the pipe and the armchair, the zombie and the chemical plant, etc. Fun to watch!<br />I actually did something like this myself when I was 17 or so.<br /><br />Music!<br /><br />The memories of the late 70s came back to me. The music and the excitement are really great.<br /><br />Hackneyed Themes:<br /><br />Yes there were some \\"I've seen this before\\" themes of government abuse, secrets, abducting the alien (!), it escapes, the misunderstood scientist, the innocent children that make it right while the adults are clueless.<br /><br />But it's HOW Abrams and Spielberg put these themes together, with a few twists (the fathers' involvement) and the success these filmmakers did in recreating the time period, the attitudes, the 1950s horror alien invasion Grade B style, that makes this film so charming.<br /><br />Bottom Line: There are some scenes where the kids swear like truck drivers; it's not a lot but parents should know. Highly recommend this film, especially for those who grew up in the 70s, enjoyed Journey and Blondie, and loved the film E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial. The trailers make believe this film is a typical invasion story. That's done on purpose. It's a coming of age story that is charming in its execution. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Cast & Crew:<br /><br />Director:<br />J.J. Abrams<br /><br />Producer:<br />Steven Spielberg<br /><br />Writer:<br />J.J. Abrams<br /><br />Stars:<br />Elle Fanning, Amanda Michalka and Kyle Chandlermical plant, etc. Fun to watch!<br />I actually did something like this myself when I was 17 or so.<br /><br />Music!<br /><br />The memories of the late 70s came back to me.

B00KW23WOC|3|Entertaining, but requires a lot of imagination stretching. Characters smart and clever one minute, stupid and taken advantage of the next.
B00E1LRCY6|1|very dissappointed with the movie content. Should have rented it so I could just send it back.
1451627297|4|GOOD READ.....EXCELLENT INFO OF WAY OF LIFE DURING LATE 50s AND EARLY 60s....( but a long read...)
B00KWVZ750|5|Nothing like the boring old slingshot stuff but to me I like angry birds go better but you have got to get this game it rules.
B00FAX6XQC|4|If you want a realistic hunting game this is it. it is like your actually hunting and the guns are great!

B006LSZECO|4|I found myself struggling to read Gone Girl in the first half of the book. It was hard work for me, for three reasons:<br /><br />1. Written in first person. For some reason, I usually find novels written in first person to require more effort.<br /><br />2. Two narrators. Flynn alternates narrators every chapter. Different personalities, different voices. Multiply the first person issue times two.<br /><br />3. Unreliable narrator. The narrators seem to be telling opposite sides of the same story, but they can't be--something's not quite right. Somebody might be trying to pull the wool over our eyes. But which one?<br /><br />This makes the first half of the book unsettling. What's going on here?<br /><br />But hang on. Around the halfway point, things become a bit more clear, and then it's a race to the finish.<br /><br />Flynn's writing gives her characters fresh, outspoken personalities and dialog that sparkles. The dynamics of the relationships are very intense.<br /><br />So if you're thinking about reading this book, I encourage you to dive in. Don't give up during the first half. It takes some work, but it's worth it.
B000056NX5|5|I was an adult when this show first materialized.  I have seen it on stage many times.  I loved the visuals of the film.  This, however is the first time I have been moved to tears by this vehicle.  I simply can not take any individual piece of this apart it is a whole and it is wonderful.  Of all the work that Webber &amp; Rice have done this will last the longest as I have seen in this production that what ever else may be done the story will forever be vital.  I greatly appreciated the emphasis on the lyric and the downplay of the music.  It has been put where it belongs, as an underscore of what it being said and done.  I have read some reviews that felt Jesus was weak, I for one got far more out of his eyes than ever before,  I also liked the fact that the man could sing, falsetto and in full chest voice.  Judas is incredible, Mary sang her pieces in character and not as a &quot;STAR&quot; turn.  On the whole very emotional piece.
B00C1TOTK0|5|great
B00000IMYA|5|A great two disc album  of Ellington!
B003Y5H5C4|3|Dwayne (Danny McBride) despises his father (Fred Ward) and wants his riches.  The natural choice is to link up with a bonehead friend named Travis (Nick Swardson) to make a bomb, kidnap a pizza delivery guy named Nick (Jesse Eisenberg), make Nick rob a bank, and use the money from the bank heist to hire a hitman (horribly out of place Michael Pena).  If it sounds like a little bit too much to squeeze together into a coherent plot that has a semblance of believability, I agree.  And that's not even considering the hitman's intricate side story, flamethrowers, an Indian best friend inexplicably named Chet (Aziz Ansari), and the dreaded, unnecessary romantic angle that seemingly gets shoe-horned into every movie for absolutely no redeemable reason (well, getting Dilshad Vadsaria some screen time is the only redeemable reason).<br /><br />There are several laughs, and fans of McBride will like the movie more than most.  He absolutely steals the movie from the intended \\"star\\" Eisenberg, who does his best to distance himself from Zombieland.  The distance is not enough, and Rule #1 needs to be revisited.  He is neither believable or worth rooting for - unlike Zombieland.  He plays Eisenberg.  It's interesting to note, however, that McBride plays a stereotypical McBride character and comes off brilliantly.<br /><br />It's nothing that will blow your socks off, but it's not the worst thing I've ever seen.  The deleted scenes and outtakes are pretty good.  Rent it; don't buy it.
B007IXWL2C|5|I read a review of a movie once that described the film as sweet and terrifying. These two words do not usually pair up so I was intrigued.  Although these books were not terrifying, they had their moments with the control freak, creepy boss, and kidnapping.  The books surprised me with the love story.  Overall I would rate these books with five stars.  I could not stop reading.
B00BAXFAOW|4|This book made me think differently about class sizes, the 3 strikes you're out law, and others.  Maybe what you always thought was correct really isn't.
B00A1EOBJQ|5|I LOVE THIS!!!
B000JQU1VS|5|It is a classic!<br />How can you say anything other than this is what we grew up on on high school.
B00BAXFECK|4|I often hate for a book to end, but The Goldfinch was excruciatingly long. I enjoyed the plot, characters and prose, but It would have been a  much better book if about 200 pages had been red penciled.
B00HAQCLNQ|3|The acting ensemble was superb and Cate Blanchett met Academy Awards standards, though I did not see all the other films actress nominated to comment on being the best. The back and forth between time periods worked well, which is not always the case, however Jasmine/Jeanette does not overcome the challenges of her journey while those around her find their way. I am old fashion and want the heroine to triumph.
B005HSG3U6|5|It is a great item to own, and will help protect my Kindle Fire.  I am very happy I purchased this item and would recomment it to anyone else that owns a Kindle Fire!
B00I29VGMC|5|This by all means is a five star book! Mia Sheridan outdone herself with this one. The writing style was awesome. Loved Bree and Archer's story. The main characters had believable and real independent struggles of life coupled with falling in love with each other.  It's about a couple finding their own happiness and overcoming their own issues. It has the HEA I always look for in a book. This book Wil leave a true smile on your face at the end. Thanks Mia Sheridan for sharing Bree & Archer's story with us.
B003VS0CX8|5|First, I wanted to address a 1 star review that complained because they couldn't get the BD version to play in their BD player and got an error message about needing an upgrade.    Many of the BD movies require that your Blu Ray player have the latest firmware available from it's manufacturer.  They also frequently require that the BD player have at least 1GB of additional memory in order to play the BD disk.  This is especially common with BD disks that include the BD Live option.    Most players can be connected to the Internet via a standard Ethernet cable if you have a connection to the Internet via DSL or cable services.  Check your manual for instructions on how to hook your BD player to the Internet and upgrade it's firmware. It's usually done through the menu options in the BD player itself.    Also check your BD player manual on what type of flash memory card or stick it uses and how to install it.  There is usually a slot for it in the rear of the player. The slot is frequently labled EXT, at least on Sony BD players. You can get these memory cards at most stores that sell electronics and cameras or order them online at Amazon.  A 1GB card or stick is usually sufficient.    As for the movie, this is a fantastic transfer with stunning detail and clarity on the video and exquisite sound. Don't wait!  Order this movie today!
B00PRXDUE8|3|This was hard for me to review this. I want to watch again, because I liked the actors but was not prepared for the pain and intensity of the movie.<br />I suspect I would rate it higher out of &#34;appreciation&#34; for the film but at a first impression, visceral level it was disturbing, which I believe it was supposed to be.
B00KW3PLAE|5|I absolutely loved the Maple Creek game and this was a great follow-up. I really enjoyed the puzzles and the little seek and finds throughout the game. Definitely a great buy.
B00I6IKSZ0|5|This game is awesome!!!!!  You should get it this sweet awesome cool amazing great game!!!!!! So get this game now!
B00I8Q77Y0|5|Love how this app opens perfectly every time and the  birds make me laugh with the squeaking and what not hahaha
038553082X|4|I think of Michio Kaku as either a physicist writing on nuclear power or string theory or as a peace activist.  So I wondered what a physicist was writing about the brain.  In the last 20 years we have learned 70% of what we know about the brain, largely because physics has influenced radiology so that we can see the workings of the brain through the skull.  For instance we can see what areas of the brain light up when certain emotionally laden words are spoken but that is a long way from being able to read the mind.  Disabled people, even those locked into totally immobile bodies while having intact brains, can be hooked up to mentally control computers that move and control lights, computers and television channels- even robots.  The interaction between mind and computer will permit great advances.<br /><br />Kaku writes skillfully and enthusiastically and explains things in terms that laymen will understand.  I took off one star for overstatement - even with dramatic insights we have a long way to go.  But I highly recommend this book.
B00000AFGM|5|if you ask me THIS is MM most controversial album because alot of his die hard fans picked this up and felt he sold out but we are his family and you have to look past the glam and hype.  this is a great album, full of bowie influenced glam rock but with the MM twist that just rocks.  cannot we support an artist who is willing to change his style rather than regurgatate the same old same old as not to upset the \\"fans\\"?  i would rather have an artist change and give me something to challenging to listen to and think about.  <BR>    commenting on the hollowness of fame this album is quite the departure from the grinding blasting metal of ACS.  here we see a lighter popier side of MM  with songs like the speed of pain which is a quiet contemplative tune.  my personal favorite is disassociative but you cannot lose with songs like i dont like the drugs and the knack influenced new model.  <BR>     if you want a good pop album then this is it, if you want a GOOD artist then marilyn is a perfect start.  anyway you slice it, this is a winner
B004VMUS9G|5|It works great and has lots of options to change allowing you to create as many different alarms as you want that are customized to be exactly the way you want them to be.\nOne down side is that the math questions are not sorted well by difficulty but if you get one that is too hard you can set an option to allow you to pass questions. I have it set on hard and can usually find a problem that is easy enough to solve in the morning by passing only once or twice.

0446672653|5|Only Love is Real addresses the topic of past lives and their relevance from the standpoint of a traditional psychotherapist.  As a distinguished M.D. and graduate of Columbia University and Yale Medical School, Dr. Brian Weiss was surprised and incredulous when under hypnosis one of his patients began recalling a trauma that had occurred several thousand years ago in a past life.  Amazingly, this trauma proved to hold the elusive solution to her recurring nightmares and anxiety attacks.  This seminal point in Dr. Weiss' career caused a turn down a professional path that included travels over thousands of years to discover the healing his patients needed.  Events in one's life, according to Weis, are shaped by lessons - learned and unlearned - from prior lives.  Only Love is Real examines patients' experiences from the standpoint of soulmates.  A soulmate is someone who incarnates in one's life to finish unfinished business or repay a karmic debt.<br /><br />The stories offered by Dr. Weiss in Only Love is Real provide insight into a field that is often fraught is confusion - the arena of love.  Why do people from completely differing backgrounds find each other and make a relationship work?  What is the attraction?  Only Love is Real offers a unique answer to questions that have baffled the world since time immemorial.  The stories are engaging, the concepts groundbreaking, and the lessons offered life-changing.
630575067X|4|As a Star Wars fan it is my resposibility to point out the high and low points of this film.  First I would like to do a short analysis for some of the major characters.<br />Qui-Gon: His role was one of the things that really  held this film together.  Liam did a great job as this Jedi  Master<br />Obi-Wan:  Ewan did a great job portraying Obi in his apprentice  years.  His character was very believable.<br />Queen Amidala: Natalie did a  fairly good job portraying the young queen.  Few of her lines came off  lame.<br />Anakin Skywalker:  How could you.  I think George could have found  a much better actor to portray somebody so important to the Star Wars story  like that kid from the Sixth Sense Haley Joel.  His lines came across very  lame.<br />Darth Maul:  He was my favorite character of the film because he  was so cool.  Ray Parks martial arts skills are unbelievable.  However, his  character should have been developed much more.<br />Darth Sidious:  Very  mysterious.  Personally I think he is the Emperor himself, only time will  tell.  His character is very sith-like.<br />Senator Palpatine:  As always,  Ian Mcdiarmid does a great job portraying the greedy senator who is soon to  become the Emperor. Jar Jar Binks:  He should not have even been a main  character.  He stole so much of the show and should have had 50% less  screen time.<br />The plot of this movie wasn't all that bad which was the  blockade and boycott of Trade routes to the planet of Naboo.  I feel as  though a lot more will be explained in the upcoming movie which is due for  a May 2002 release.  Some parts of the movie were very predicatable such as  the podrace.  The lightsaber fights were just mind boggling.  Once again I  say that Ray Park was perfectly fit for the role of Darth Maul because he  is capable of doing all the fancy kicking and knows how to fight with a  double-edged sword.  However, the journey back to Tatooine and the  lightsaber fights were nostalgic and brought back a lotof the Star Wars  atmosphere.  The reason why I gave this movie 4 stars is because of Jar Jar  and Anakin.  Everything else fell perfectly into place.  This will probably  remain one of my favorite movies and with the exeption of those two  characters, it is worthy of its position in the Star Wars saga.
B009EEKPWQ|4|Love Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep. Wonderful fashion scenes. Probably much like the real world of Haute Couture.
B00N1JQ2UO|5|great sound track, with an underrated story, and great film quality.  to me, it's better than the Avengers
0060530839|5|This allegorical book, supposedly aimed at children, provided Mr. Lewis with a wonderful medium to deliver a Christian message to readers of all ages.  He casts the perennial contest between good and evil as a secret adventure of four displaced children in a land frozen under the control of a wily wicked witchy ruler.  While good prevails, it does not come without struggle and sacrifice.  Along the way the Lion of Judah acquires a new name and important lessons of loyalty and courage are learned.    I really like books that are inspiring, thought-provoking, and fun.  It makes me wonder what is in the back of all my closets!  This book makes a great gift for young people that they will treasure throughout life.  Another Christian fantasy book I like, aimed at a somewhat older audience, is [[ASIN:0979745926 ARROWS THROUGH TIME: A Time Travel Tale of Adventure, Courage, and Faith]].
0385523394|4|Got this for my girlfriend. She can't stop reading it. It's great. Gives me time to myself. Hopefully she will want to go to prison now. That'd be great. Then I could get a sex change and join her and be shower buddies. She likes the book. Different from the show I guess. I don't care. Like I said, keeps the girlfriend out of my face. 4 stars for that right there.
B00E8KLWB4|5|I've been playing this game for a while now and I can truly say that I'm completely addicted to it. It's just so much fun! I highly recommend this game to everyone!
B00000DOYH|5|Led Zeppelin doubles up on the fun in this 1975 double album, which makes sense since it had been two years since the release of \\"Houses of the Holy.\\"  Repeated listening makes it clear that each disc should be taken on its own terms.  Every time I listen to Disc One of \\"Physical Graffiti\\" I come to the conclusion that most of these songs were created out of jam sessions, as opposed to Page and Plant sitting down in the living room and working on tunes. You get the feeling Jimmy Page was fooling around, found some guitar riff that he liked and then Led Zeppelin fashioned an entire song out of it (e.g., \\"Custard Pie\\" and \\"Houses of the Holy\\"). The same thing with John Paul Jones's organ work on \\"Trampled Under Foot\\" and John Bonham's drumming on \\"Kashmir.\\" Clearly \\"Physical Graffiti\\" is Led Zeppelin's most collaborative album, with Jones and Bonham getting credits on six of the 15 tracks. While \\"Kashmir\\" has always been the most recognizable song on the album, long before Puff Daddy remixed it for the giant green lizard movie bomb, the group's true showpiece is the 11:08 \\"In My Time of Dying,\\" which finally gets the boys back in the neighborhood of the blues (along with \\"Boogie With Stu\\" and a few other tracks). \\"Dying\\" is the longest studio track in the entire Led Zep repertoire and one of four songs 6:55 or longer on the album. Who needs A.M. Top 40 air play?<br />In contrast Disc Two contain the lighter songs, the acoustic \\"Bron-Yr-Aur\\" and the cutesy \\"Down By The Seaside,\\" as well as another attempt to duplicate \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" with \\"Ten Years Gone,\\" before getting back to big time rock and roll (e.g., \\"The Wanton Song\\" and \\"Sick Again\\").  This is clearly the more experimental disc in the set, although I would not go so far as to suggest that the second comprises the \\"graffti\\" to the \\"physical\\" first.  More than any other Led Zeppelin album, \\"Physical Graffiti\\" reminds us that while Page and Plant were always out in front the rhythm section of Jones and Bonham was equally as good, even if the pair were under appreciated in comparison. Along with their first and fourth albums, this is one of Led Zeppelin's best, its filler cuts more than compensated for by the overall ambition of the effort.nham was equally as good, even if the pair were under appreciated in comparison.

B00TEAVEY8|3|Fun game
B00CWGLOY6|4|Saga is a great story about two enemies who fall on love have baby and are on the run. That is the short version the long is cool I can't do it justice. The start was slow but action and suspense pay of at the end.

B007N6NGYG|4|I do recommend and love this game. The graphics are incredible. The game itself is nerve-wracking. Trying to maneuver 4 trains to their stations without crashing into one another is certainly a challenge. Takes patience but is a &#34;train-load&#34; of fun.
0062301233|5|I first spied this book while shopping at Costco. I had never heard of Elon Musk before, but when I opened the flap of the book and read that he was the co inventor of Pay Pal and the CEO of TESLA Motors and Space X - I knew that this was an important book for me to read because these companies are 3 of the most important companies on our planet today.<br />Much is not known about Elon Musk, a man born of American parents who was born in South Africa, and he lived there until his grand escape at the tender age of 18. Elon had alot of ambition, drive and a huge intellect; here is a man with a truly beautiful mind. He thinks about a business situation and zeros in on what makes the business problematic. But what's unusual about Elon is he is able to solve those problems, and restore a robust business with great profitability. He is a natural born businessman, but all of his colleges will assure you that he is truly a physicist and scientist at heart. He is a whiz on computers as well, but has not had any formal education on computer science and is not a computer scientist. But it's funny how he knows his limitations and is quite adept at recruiting top talent to work in his businesses. Elon is a good boss who may not pay the highest wages, but in terms of having the freedom to do what you want to do in the work place is quite the draw for top talent these days. True autonomy is a rare thing in business.<br />What Elon wants from a person (his employees) is someone who is ultra focused on a task and will work 24 hours a day - because that is his psychological address. If a person wants to work for Tesla motors or Space X, this person is better off being single and unattached because Elon will set him on a course of hyperactivity to solve all the unsolvable problems of the galaxy, and this poor employee will have unbelievable deadlines! Much of what Elon Musk achieves is brilliant and was said &#34;Could not possibly be done in this lifetime,&#34; but somehow Elon managed to get the job done - in a relatively reasonable amount of time.<br />His achievements are legendary and he won the hard-earned respect of his peers as well as Wall Street. He is an impressive man with an unbeatable work ethos!!!<br /><br />It's as if another advanced civilization conducted experiments on human reproduction and came up with a way to create a super smart humanoid creature to help the world because they felt sorry for us Earthlings and the stupid way that we solve all our problems.  They must have felt so sorry for the mess that we're in that they created Elon Musk in an effort  to help us out - in some sort of extraordinary way.<br />These aliens fashioned a rather homely looking man, gave him a strange place to be born and raised, sent bullies along the way in his teenage years to toughen him up psychologically ( including his father, who played cruel mind tricks on him and his 2 siblings). What they ended up with was the perfect man who could change industry and how earthlings drive and work.<br />Elon had a most unfortunate childhood, but he did have a beautiful earth mother who loved him and supported him.<br />Elon does not go into detail about all the strange things his old man did to him during his formative years, but we are led to understand that his father was a SOB of the first order. Elon really suffered so much, but we have to think discreetly at what went wrong. Just because a man is smart does not spare him from the sadness of this mortal life. Elon lost an infant son, he has alot of personal problems with his family members and faced bankruptcy with both Tesla Motors and Space X in 2008. That was a killer year for Elon, but somehow he was able to persevere in light of the world giving him adversity.<br /><br />Anyhow - Elon Musk is an important person for everyone to get to know via the printed text. This biography was well-researched by a man named Ashlee Vance, and I never met a man who was given that name before. Normally womenhave that name but in this case, Ashlee is a man but I hope he goes by a shortened version of his name, which would be Ash.<br /><br />In this book, it is told how Tesla Motors came to be. The car was named after a famous inventor, Nicoli Tesla who had the idea of smart phones and he invented something called the Tesla coil, which was an electrical invention of sorts that I don't really get. He died in 1934, and had alot of wildly creative and inventive ideas. Elon Musk draws alot of parallels to this man.<br />Also I am drawn to remember the great Verner Von Braun, the rocketeer pioneer who invented and built the Saturn V rockets that launched all of the Apollo space missions. Remember that everything Apollo was created before computers were as good as they are today.<br /><br />Elon Musk also helped develop a company called Solar City which is all about the installation of solar panels in homes and creating a clean and sustainable source of energy in a way that is affordable for everyone.<br /><br />Elon is a true creative genius who somehow fell to earth.  He is a man destined to change the world as we know it today. After reading this fine book, I was able to understand his totally electric luxury road car, the Tesla Model S. I want to buy one in the worst way, BUT THEY'RE TOO DANG EXPENSIVE ($100,000.00) So I drive a Prius and I love that car alot!  Elon promises that by 2020, one version of his Tesla motorcars will be available for purchase in the $35 thousand dollar range. I want one in the worst way!  They come equipped with a 17 inch computer flat screen on the dash that has 24/7 connectivity to the internet. They can perform adjustments to your car's circuitry overnight (over the air) as your car sit parked quietly in your garage. Elon installed a music system that allows the driver to say the name of a song and the artist, and that song will play on the stereo system right away, with nothing for the driver to mess with or program.<br />Tesla owners can drive for 300 miles until they have to re-energize their car batteries.  Elon is building Tesla super charging stations all over the nation to keep his cars motoring along, and so the driver never has to experience range anxiety.  The cars have a display with GPS that can advise the driver where the nearest super charging station is, and then when they drive to that super-charging station, it's only 20 minutes to a full charge! To top that off, it's free super charges for LIFE! Elon can afford to supply this electricity because remember, he also owns the solar technology (Solar City systems) that are connected to his stations. He collects the solar energy from solar panels nearby, stores it in a battery and then the energy is available to the Tesla consumer. It's another way to quiet any arguing against buying one of his beautiful Tesla Model S cars. He is coming out with a Model E, a Model X and someday soon, yes - a Model Y. (SEXY) Very clever, Mr. Musk! Very clever indeed!!!<br /><br />Space X has already launched a couple dozen missions to space,and one or two deliveries to the International Space Station! (ISS). I would love to visit his plant that is only an hour's drive from my home, in Hawthorne, California - right next door to an airport. But it's a restricted area due to all the top secret inventions that lay in production at that factory on a daily basis. Elon goes in every day, Monday through Friday and he's hard at work just like everyone else. All the cubby desks are arranged in such a manner that the desk workers see and can talk with the factory workers 24/7. And that plant does go 24/7/365. They take their work very seriously and never appreciate delays, lollygagging, idle time or anything that can impede progress. It's an intense place to work but everyone there says that they love it and would never change a thing! To see such harmony is inspiring in and of itself.<br /><br />All I can say is READ THIS BOOK!<br />It is very inspirational to us normal, everyday, ordinary humans who need a motivational boost now and then.<br />Elon Musk is a man on a mission, but he is a different sort of person that you are or I am. Some of his coworkers describe him as a real loner, and a person who can zone into a train of thought and he totally ignores every single person in his life.<br />Some say their feelings have gotten hurt because they get tired of being ignored and treated as if their yesterday's newspaper. But Elon doesn't do this to anger or humiliate his family, peers or friends. He just zones into his work and excludes the world and people around him.<br />There's a reason the man's been married 3 times and divorced 3 times. (He remarried and re-divorced wife # 2 twice!)<br /><br />He has a set of twins and a set of triplet offspring and they're all young, school-age boys. He employs a rather hefty sized house staff with a team of nannies to keep things organized and running smoothly. I don't know how Elon succeeds so well with all of his projects. He's done more in his young life now than a hundred normal people do in an entire lifetime. Surely Elon is receiving intellectual help from a higher life form - what he has managed to do is the stuff of legends.<br />I know that God has blessed him with the gift of the highest intellect and nerves of steel!<br /><br />Who knows, by 2020 Elon Musk may be declared the Emperor of planet Earth!!!  I wouldn't put it past him!<br /><br />Read this wonderful book and it will change the way that you think and the plans that you have for the remainder of your career and life.<br />He is truly a fantastic creature of the world and I'm led to believe that Elon is a good man with good plans and the best of intentions to guide our Earth into a cleaner and more pure future.g Tesla super charging stations all over the nation to keep his cars motoring along, and so the driver never has to experience range anxiety.

B00D7Z4GQY|5|Great book!  My favorite of hers thus far.
B00168OIP8|5|best tom movie ever.
B000PC6A3E|5|This is a review for the Blu-ray version. As it was stated by many reviews already, you know this is a darker more brooding Batman than any of the previous films. Christian Bale is perfectly cast as the Dark Knight and is easily the best Batman there has been. Liam Neeson (Ducard) is excellent as the sensei/villian, and Katie Holmes (Rachel Dawes) brings her \\"girl next door\\" charm as the love interest. Cillian Murphy is frightfully creepy as the Scarecrow/Dr Johnathan Crane. The Blu-ray version of this movie is definatly the way to go. Unsurpassed picture quality and superb audio make this the definative version to own, it makes a great movie even better.
B00DQVSTCG|1|Horrible horrible horrible audio quality on this blu Ray disc, heard it was officially recalled by the label/studio. I returned it for a full refund. I'm hoping they correct the matter and reissue the disc so I can repurchase it the way Madonna edited it to be seen.
B00MU79IL8|5|This is a great CD for jazz fans!
B007HJ91HU|5|Always a pleasure!! this movie is so fresh!
B0097EWK3A|4|Really enjoyed playing this game. The story line was one that I really enjoyed. Very aggrevating going back and forth.
B006GHA9QQ|1|This was a real disappointment. Wish I had previewed it before I bought it.<br />Stick with the original production. Too bad ALW didn't.
B00EEPFRGE|5|Definitely the best Stryper album yet!  Really heavy and melodic.  Not a throwaway track on this album.  Definitely worth getting!
B000023VR6|5|Dr. Dre continues to be one of my all-time favorite rappers, and this cd is great for any fan. My fav. songs are Still Dre, Next Episode, &amp; Forgot About Dre, featuring a great cameo from Eminem. Snoop Dogg also makes some great cameos on a lot of the songs. If you like rappers like Jay-Z &amp; Ice Cube, you'll love this cd, but if you like corny kiddie rap like Will Smith, stay away!
B00005LIN0|5|Great music, and the first time we had seen the complete story.  We bought it for our granddaughter, who loves musicals, but we sneaked a peak beforehand.  We were not disappointed in any way.  Couldn't get some of the songs out of our heads for several days afterward.
B00A8MGIZG|5|I thought it wa brilliant.  Follows the book pretty well.  Not easy to produce a film following the  characters over hundreds of years.<br />Casting worked very well.  Tom Hanks always comes through and Halle  handled the part with ease.  I'm not a critical movie viewer and just like to enjoy most of the time.
B0058DRTGC|4|Good read.
B0055B7IPE|5|It's true what they say, you will most likely cry within the first 10 minutes. I know I did. Definitely the cutest and most inspiring Disney movie I have seen in years.
B00CLD65X0|5|I have watched Downton Abbey from its first season through the third and have never been disappointed in its content, or the performance of the actors.<br /><br />The story of a titled family, moving into the new century is interesting, attention-getting and actually fun to watch.  I am loooking forward to Season 4.
006029129X|5|this book is fantastic! my daughter was introduced to harold via a scholastic DVD, and loved it so much that we bought her this compilation for her 4th birthday.  it really helps to foster the idea of imagination, and supports all of those great pre-reading skills.
B004ZN9ERI|5|I like that it is not a re-mastered version.  Too often there are subtle changes that occur in the process that detract from the original version that I want to hear.
B00FN5Z8UY|5|It's the walking dead! Of course it is great.
0670024856|5|Love this book.  So interesting! The writing is excellent.  She has an excellent command of personality, location and the topics included.  One of the best I've read this year. I highly recommend this book.
B00HXYKYIE|5|Fabulous! I've read all of Jodi's books and this was one of my favorite. Love her writing!
B00FEMJF6O|4|The games okay but it's hard to get enough money for everything I do enjoy playing the game though. It passes time when I'm bored but I wish they would do more with it.
B00KK0PICK|5|I read some reviews...and I felt some of the reviewers were being sarcastic when they simply repeated what the Author states &#34;only keep xyz item..if it sparks joy!&#34;-- I know those reviewers ONLY skimmed the book.  Once you read the entire book, and internalise it, YOU will know and understand &#34;only keep xyz item if it sparks JOY&#34;--on e you have &#34;just the things I life that make you happy...you WILL be happy!&#34;<br /><br />The book is an easy read...don't rush through too quickly...read it, and think about it, and re-read it...and you will &#34;know it, and it will be easy for you, the KonMari method.&#34;
B000089RVX|2|All the hype about this album convinced my girlfriend to force me to buy her this album. I was hesitant at first after hearing the song from DareDevil. Anyway, i bought it for her. We listened to it in my car, and before the 3rd song was over i noticed she was getting bored. So  i decided to pop in Lacuna Coil's Comalies and she woke up. Now this CD is sitting somewhere in my car (together with my running shoes) and she has all my Lacuna Coil and Nightwish CDs... Sure taught her a lesson about relying in reviews too much. This CDs not that bad, its just not worth it unless you're really a fan of the band i think.
B004SD5GZ4|5|no problem installing works great yes you're using the desktop<br />also comes in handy when downloading documents from your email
B00008LOS1|5|First off, this is a message to the people at amazon.  I've noticed a lot of bogus reviews where you get these pin heads with nothing better to do then to give one stars to classic albums.  This is only being done so they can pull down the over all rating of perfect albums like this.  The fact is that todays recording tricksters will NEVER match the greatness of The Who, The Beatles, The Stones, Led Zeppelin, or anyone else from that period.  If you look at any art form (fine art, theater, or other forms of music) they all have a golden period, this was Rock/Pop's.  So all you little Rap and so called Alternative listening wankers listen up, THE WASTE OF AUDIO TAPE YOU LISTEN TO DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE TO BE IN THE SAME RECORD STORE WITH THE WHO.  Put that in your pipe and smoke it!
B009KCUX3S|5|I found this book very interesting. I new way to learn programming, it really made me laugh. The good this is that it is helping me learn Java faster than I thought.
B0089LOG02|5|Even though the title is not inviting, everything else in this book is. Kline tells an absorbing story with colorful characters and a fast moving plot. She adds warmth to both characters and plot and tosses in a lot of love too.
B0011ZNAIC|5|This is a very cute film for children and for their parents.  Good choice for a family movie night with the little ones.  My little one loves this movie so much she insists on watching it once a day every since we bought it!
B0050DIWFC|5|I loved this book!  Lots of twists and turns with several surprises along the way!  This book also gives readers a glimpse of issues facing teens today. As a parent i could really feel the pain of Jacobs parents. This was one iof those books I couldn't  wait to get to the end to see what happens but hated to finish it because it was so good!
B003XTYDMQ|4|A fun show. Great, likable characters. Scenes with Veronica and her dad are the best, they have a fantastic rapport.

B000002I27|4|Strange Days is the last of the 'old Doors' sound that was so capitivating on the debut album. After Strange Days, fame and fortune permeated the band and their sound changed. They became more top 40. It's no wonder Morrison  got sick of the whole thing. A little of the magic was recaptured on L.A.  Woman, but it doesn't hold a flame to the first two albums.
6304509154|4|Excellent GHOST film works mainly becuz  of f/x and refreshing directing by horror legend Tobe Hooper. Although a bit of Spielberg is noticing at times, if it werent for the opening credits where they plaster his name on just about every credit that u could possibly think of, there's NO way that any Tom, Dick, and Harry would ever notice that he had anything to do with this masterpiece. Its paced like a roller coaster. It never gets boring from start to finish. That's an HONOR! Kudos to Spielberg for fleshing out such a vivid and imaginative screenplay. Guess some of that JAWS notoriety rubbed off and his head inflated to the size of the Goodyear Blimp. Anyway, the film is scary in every aspect. Although i was surprised that a film with such gore could somehow slide underneath MPAA raters and snag a PG rating. Wow. They musta been thinkin...Hey if Spielberg has this film under HIS belt...why not try to make another JAWS! Except this time use Ghosts and Better f/x to better the monster. Well ladies and gents, this sure as heck isnt JAWS. Yet still credible in every sense of word and feeling. Frightening at times and hysterical at others. A MUST SEE for movie Buffs like me and my pal Allie&gt; Huh?
B00I0O9QJY|2|After the sensational album that was [[ASIN:B0043WGORO Aphrodite]], and the energetic, non-album single [[ASIN:B0087DVGMS Timebomb]], who would have imagined her next album would be this uninspiring?  Gone are the catchy melodies, feet moving dance tunes, and sexy vocal flow she is renowned for, and it's replaced by some of the worst melodies and arrangements I've ever heard on any Kylie album.  Even the first 5 seconds of piano melody from Get Outta My Way (from [[ASIN:B003IPC5SO Aphrodite]]) is better than anything found here. There's just nothing to draw you in, no timeless dance/pop classics, and far, far from any strong singles.  Timebomb is better than anything on this album, and it should have at least been included; although, even that wouldn't have helped.  I see she has worked with a new production team; well, I don't think it was the right fit.  I am utterly disappointed with this release and her new sound.<br /><br />Into The Blue and Sexy Love are probably the two best offerings on here, but neither will be songs we'll remember as classic Kylie tunes.  The album isn't sexy, despite there being 3 song titles with the word sex in it, and her closed eye look on the cover isn't welcoming or appealing in the least.  The song Sexercize is basically an embarassment, and how many times can Kyle singing the word \\"go\\" be looped over and over again in the 3 minute song, I Was Gonna Cancel?  Also, the delivery of the lyrics to Million Miles sounds very awkward, particularly of her singing the word \\"million\\", not to mention the equally as peculiar \\"faye-yaye-yeine\\" rendition during the song Fine.  Kiss Me Once features a very third-rate backing drum beat, and If Only sounds like the notes and melody are off key and do not flow correctly.  That auto tuning sound in Beautiful just ruins her duet with Enrique Iglasias.<br /><br />Most Kylie remixes do not do her songs justice and I tend to prefer her original tracks, but this will be her first album where I'd be looking forward to hearing the remixes over these album tracks.  Even those may not make this album shine any brighter.  Let's hope we get better songs and a more engaging cover photo of Kylie for her next LP.  I cannot recommend this album, barring two tracks you may want to download just to have a few new Kylie tracks to listen to.
0440236738|3|I didn't think this was near as good as some of Harlan's books, but it was a fun listen.  It's terribly convoluted with who done it and it's quite entertaining, but it's not the most delicious novel I've ever read.  As well, the reader was not the best for this book.  At least there wasn't music in the background.  It's worth the purchase and the listen...or read.  It's still good...
B003EYVXTG|1|While I have ordered and received some very good products from Amazon, this DVD goes lacking.  I am NOT referring to the story; I am very glad to see the movie as I lived in Branson MO, which is in the Ozarks, and went to High School there so you can see I had a personal interest in this story as I had never heard of these types of things going on in MO and sure they did not, back in the 1950's.  However, my complaint is with the quality of the DVD...at a very important place in the movie, the DVD was totally not visible but for some very mixed up scenes...little squares across the picture and etc.  I've really not known how to get in touch with you and thought I would watch it again one day to see if it was a good quality DVD.  It breaks my heart as I could not see the part of the movie where they went on the lake and no telling how much more.  My DVD player has no problem playing perfectly many other DVD's so it is NOT my player.  Also I checked the DVD itself and found no scratches or dust on it so what in the world is this defective DVD doing on the market??????  I hope to hear from you and would appreciate a Pre-paid label to return this one to you.  I am a Widow on a fixed income and love the books and DVD's I've previously ordered from you but this has been a Big Surprise with a Bad ending. I have always recommended Amazon over Deep Discount and other places to buy books and DVD's. Pls contact me.  thank you, peggy westmoreland neal

B00003CX97|5|David Lean (Lawrence of Arabia) directs this 1957 adapatation of Pierre Boulle's (author of 'Planet of the Apes') great World War II novel.  The film still stands as one of the greatest war films ever made with superb direction and an all-star cast that provide deep character studies with all the action and tension one expects from a war story.    Confined to an inhospitable Japanese prison camp burried in the jungles of Southeast Asia, a British POW, Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), is subjected to the cruel torture of the camp commander Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) for choosing to stand for principle as to the treatment of his officers.  Saito needs competent engineers and laborers to build a railroad tressle bridge on a tight schedule and, although at first infuriated by Nicholson's stiff upper lip and low opinion of Japanese culture, he begins to exploit Nicholson's ego to compel him to build the bridge properly and on time.  Thinking that he will show the 'inferior' Japanese how much better the English are in engineering, Nicholson becomes obsessed with building the enemy bridge and oblivious to the treasonous implications of such an act.  In the mean time, a cowardly American POW (William Holden) escapes to safety only to be later coerced by the English to return and sabotage the bridge in a commando raid.  Leading the British demolition expert (Jack Hawkins), Holden's character returns to the bridge for the final showdown.    This is a brilliant war film with a plot that's primarily character driven as opposed to action driven: the tension comes from the clash of wills between all of the characters as opposed to a non-stop action clash of arms.  The film also seems to deal with the uncertain consequences of bravery and cowardice in the sense that, although Nicholson at first bravely stands for his principles, he blindly becomes a suppliant to Colonel Saito's plans to finish the bridge.  On the other hand, although Holden's character is the epidemy of cowardice and self-interest, it is he who becomes one of the true heroes of the story.  The film in essence follows the story by Pierre Boulle but, as is almost always the case, the book is better.  In the book, there is no flinching to Nicholson's unrelenting snobbishness and utter stupidity and he does not 'wake up' at the last minute to fall on the detonator: the mission fails. Also, William Holden's character does not exist. There is no American ex-POW guiding the commandos back to the bridge.    This film is very well directed and has great camera work.  Filmed in Sri Lanka, the great cinematography captures every ray of heat and drop of humidity one finds in the dense jungle. The acting is top knotch all the way around. Finally, who can forget the timeless whistling tune sung by the POWs.  This is another great drama that should be in every war film lover's collection.
B00I75EROU|2|Unusual story line for Stephen King. But he delivers in sucking you into the story and not letting go until the very end. Not as scary or demented as some of his other writing but still a good light read.
B008OD38JK|5|If you are reading this, you are probably already aware of the brilliance of the Zimmer/Newton Howard scores for the Dark Knight Trilogy. Each one presents a beautiful score, evoking images and favorite scenes from the films while providing inspiration to even the most amateur musicians and composers. Too many of Hollywood's film scores in the last decade owe their existance to these works. But you probably already knew that, so let's move on.<br /><br />This particular CD is a collection of hilights from all three scores, performed by one of the many small-time recording orchestras popping up these days. London Music Works is one of the rare orchestras that actually puts effort and passion into their interpretations - and make no mistake, these are intrepretations. While, at timees it may feel like you are listening to the original scores, subtle nuances in tempo, instrumentation, and dynamics provide the listener with a wholely unique approach to these songs. Contributions by the equally talented City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra accentuate this album. For me, the hilights of this particular album were \\"Why So Serious?\\" (which allows you to hear what a normal orchestra could do with this rather than Zimmer's electronically-enhanced orchestra), \\"A Watchful Guardian\\" (which is a track that does not appear on the original \\"Dark Knight\\" soundtrack but rather on the 2-disc special edition, making it a unique choice), and \\"Imagine The Fire\\" and \\"Rise\\" (both of which have obvious differences from their original versions, making them unique approaches to these songs).<br /><br />Several other reviewers are asking why you would buy this album when the original soundtracks are so readily available. The answer is simple: Just like a fan of Mozart or Beethoven's might have a favorite recording of their favorite symphony, they probably own other interpretations, allowing them, as a listener, to fully explore the possibilities of the work. Film scores are, in my opinion, the symphonies of the contemporary age. If someone is willing to offer you a new interpretation of your favorite work, and you are willing to explore the possibilities offered by that intrepretation, then do so. At the very least, it will allow you to better understand what you loved about the original recordings by Zimmer/Newton Howard. Or maybe, in these troubled economic times, you want to save a penny or two - this is a worthy supplement to those soundtracks (though I would still suggest you start saving to buy the originals). Either way, this is an affordable way to further enjoy some of the best symphonic work in the past decade.
0553213105|5|As embarrassing as it sounds, I must make a confession: I, a male college student, was up till two a.m. on a Saturday finishing this book.  In short, the novel is well worth the attention of any personality type, any demographic, any fancy, any interest.  It is a marvelous story, written flawlessly, and with such a humorous personality to bind it all together that one might frequently erupt aloud in laughter.<br />The laughter, while abundant and universally entertaining, does not supercede the primary intentions of this novel, signified in the title by &quot;Pride&quot; and &quot;Prejudice.&quot;  And, indeed, in these two arenas, Austin succeeds marvelously in creating a tale that thrusts upon the reader both of these emotions, causing him to experience and be embarrassed by his own possession of these two traits.  In that case, Pride and Prejudice is a work of pure genius.  Especially with the subject of the Prejudice, the reader becomes so involved in the misconceptions and assumptions between one character and another that he is thrown through the tumultuous emotions that form the characters into more just and honorable characters at the novels conclusion.<br />Having had only Sense and Sensibility as a prior introduction to Jane Austin, I emphatically commit that Pride is the greater, more humorous, more emotionally charged, and more intellectually potent novel.  To the very degree which the reader wrongfully dislikes--even abhors--certain characters in the book, makes the conclusions finale--long awaited and anxiously feared to be tragic--the more powerful of a climax.  Never before have I read a book that so forcefully charged me to reevaluate my own convictions and prejudice of other people.  It is truly a masterwork of reader manipulation, as the characters in the book are pulled ride along side, and both the fictional and non-fictional assumptions are cast aside and replaced with shame and embarrassment.<br />In conclusion, there are so many reasons to read this book that it is impossible to deny.  Read it for the laughter, for the story, for the passion, for the irrefutable and welcome reversal that it will no doubt spur in each reader who picks the novel up.  There is so much to learn and so much fun to be had with this book, that no one should be deprived of the experience.

B00B3HJMLM|5|love his music
B008EQIK90|4|This movie was far better than I had expected it to be.  I watched it after watching the sequel, first.  It isn't as good as the sequel, but is very good in its own right.  It is clear that the two main characters have a good friendly chemistry with each other, which at least doubles the rating I would have given the movie otherwise.
B009ZZDNT6|5|This is a great app! The choice of music or alarm is wonderful. The ability to dim the display and use this as my bedroom clock is also a great feature. Being able to program multiple alarms with different times is means I don't have to constantly mess with the program. I set it once for the entire week! For a free version, this clock/alarm is the best I've found.
B000002BHE|5|I have 3 of Celine's cd's, and Falling Into You is my favorite by far. I have just purchased her new album &quot;All the way&quot; as well as her Christmas Album, &quot;These are special times.&quot;  She is absolutely  fantastic.  I hate the thought of her retiring, but can understand.  There  is no one today performing that can equal her.  Her voice gives me goose  bumps. It's amazing that anyone can sing that way.  I have her cd's in the  car and that's all I listen to. She is my absolute favorite singer and I  can't wait to see her farewell concert on November 24, 1999.  I sure hate  to see her go away.
B00AFAHUXU|5|Its fast, simple, and does what its supposed to. Awesome.
B005K0HDGE|5|This book is without a doubt in my mind Stephen King's best work. He uses more than just writing in his technique. He uses emotional responses from the reader. In the book, tears will flow from your eyes, in correlation with Jake Eppings, the main character. King was remarkable. I recommend this to fans of romance, suspense, horror, sci fi, any novel genre. It was as perfect as they come.

B001BPJJ82|4|So I just got 'The Fall' via Netflix. I had never heard of it before, and I don't know why, but thankfully the trailer came out on the Playstation Network. When I first watched it I was like, \\"What the F is this?\\" It's one of those acid trip kinda movies I guess.  Like 'Barron Munchausen' if you're familiar with that.<br /><br />It stars the guy from 'Pushing Dasies' and knowing that show, he seems perfect for this movie.  Apparently this movie has been out a while, but it just got released on Blu-ray this Tuesday, and it is one amazing Blu-ray movie.  Many of the visuals are very bold and beautiful, I guess you could say kinda like 'Across the Universe'.  I've barely watched the 1st quarter of the movie and I have no idea where the story is going, but it's like one of those movies where you don't even care what the story is, you just like watching it for what it is.  But I must say, the story setup and style is very, very similar to 'The Princess Bride'.<br /><br />BTW, I can't confirm if this is true, but I heard that there was no CGI used to create the effects for this movie.  I dunno because a few look a little fishy.  Like those monks on the stairs.  But maybe they just utilized some old school forms of trick photography, I'm not really sure???
B003A1DO7W|5|Great acting, timeless yet progressive early 1970s attitudes and values, great characters.  What more can one say?  One of my favorite late westerns.
B00EIR5XP8|5|I love the Victorian period and the English novels which wove tales of mystery while educating the middle class to the plight of the poor and the injustices that lead to the reforms that followed. Dickens is perhaps the writer that most readers are familiar with, if not from them having read Dickens, but seen Dickens' world through film, Broadway and great PBS presentations.<br />One problem I have always had with Dickens is that the women who populate his novels appear to be mere shells of women, a mere dressing for the plot.<br />Wilkie Collins however has peopled this mystery with a woman who shows strength of character, wit, intelligence and ability to garner respect within this novel; and how novel is that?<br />I find him much more readable than Dickens, with more suspenseful plot lines and far more believable characters.  This should have been required reading rather than some of the Dickens that was on my high school syllabus. Definitely a book you should treat your mind to as it anchors the beginings of well crafted mystery stories.
B00684J49U|5|Love this series.  Great plot and keeps your interest.  I have watched it from the beginning and recommend to everyone.
B005KELW26|5|Love it purple is my Color and the case is durable. It folds to the back so I can hold the kindle fire in one hand. Awesome.
B003ODIZL6|3|This book was plain boring i dis not and will never enjoy it<br />Please do not read this book. Ok?
0385503954|5|Ian Mcewan is an accomplished writer. This work, \\"Atonement\\", was nominated for, \\"The Booker Prize\\", and while he did not win this time, he has one the award in the past. I have read two of his previous works, and while I enjoyed both they each were too brief. Extremely well done, but the ending came too quickly for such fine work. With, \\"Atonement\\", he has written a much more elaborate work, and has done so with a mischievous style that is as rewarding as it is deceptive. From beginning to end his game is in play and it makes for any substantial commentary very difficult without giving away the end of the maze.<br />The reader is confronted with an extremely precocious 13 years old whose behavior passes traditional boundaries to become almost unbelievable. I also found her to be both one of the most aggravating and easiest characters to dislike that I have come across in some time. Her introspective musings and personal observations became almost tiresome and entirely too difficult to accept. And if there is any doubt, her subsequent behaviors are beyond atrocious, or are they?<br />Not many authors can maintain a deceptively planned story with such skill, or maintain the tension to literally the closing sentences. The author has done this and more. When you reach the end you will at once feel that you have been had by a very clever pen, and then realize the ending is far from decisive and singular. A very wonderful tale.

B00JK4K0WK|4|I been fan of Mariah's for many years. I bought just the standard version off itunes. I already bought the single Art Of Letting Go and didnt want the bonus track remixes from the last cd she released. Anyway I will always prefer the Tommy Matola years over anything after the Day Dream album. I do love the Emancipation cd though, but everything after that has just been ok. Her voice we all know isnt what it used to be but the problem really isnt alot of songs its this image she portrays on facebook and then on idol of being very full of herself like she is the hottest thing in the world. That is a turn off to a lot of people and i am gay man who loves his Divas but the whole DAHLING and the sexy whispering videos need to go. That turns women off big time so i am sure she has lost a lot of her female audience. On facebook on valentines day her posts of her in the tub with candy was way over board. I unliked her page after that. The sexy whispering songs have went on now for years and arent great. This album though showcases more singing and while there are few clunkers listening to it as a whole, its a enjoyable ride back and forth to work. I think she on this one she is trying to give everyone a little bit of everything. A couple dance numbers, rap, r & b cuts, ballads and a gospel song. So I think just the standard version is best. The most radio friendly song on this is probably &#34;you dont know&#34;. But the only two songs i dont care for is the George Michael remake and the Dedicated song. Otherwise its a enjoyable cd.

All connected with HDMI 1.4 cables which support 3D, ethernet and audio return, i dont even use netdix i download my hd quality tv shows and blu ray rips and music using utorrent and jdownloader why would i need to waste my last hdmi port for this device when i already have enuff of what it offers already, no thank you i dont even like google chrome its a gay browser better than internet explorer tho but will never be greater than firefox..my devices all run through the 5 GHz band on my dual band network. But I changed my mind I am going to probably by one for others to use their netflix on my tv through this and wifi which will be close to 100% since i have a 2 range extenders in this room. Also for the smart phone and tablet streaming etc.
0380713802|4|Many of the negative reviews of this book point out that more often than not Bryson goes of on complaint tangents about a slew of things about his travels. I must agree with these critics. It seems obvious that if you don't like the bizzarity of red-light districts don't peruse them or if you don't want to spend an uncomfortable pair of days on a bus bound for the outer reaches of Norway don't board the bus. Simple as that! Yet Bryson does these things and finds fault with them. I believe that may have something to do with America and maybe only Americans can understand this. We are a country who, for many of us, love complaining more than not. We are not stoics. We are commenters and fault-finders. In this manner I can indentify with Bryson as I myself have been a traveller in Europe and frequently felt the same way. Another negative that stopped me from giving all the stars to this finely written book is Bryson's pervasive hate of industrialism or mass commercialism and mass tourism. I'm sorry to say it, but if we take a quick peek at the recent history of Europe we see that it may have never been the storybook/postcard destination that Bryson envisions. Maybe he had such a hard time finding his perfect Europe because its a figment of his imagination. Let's take a peek at this history- for the first half of the last Europe was rocked by the two most devestating wars ever- before that Europe experienced fifty years of instability as revolutions came and were violently supressed in nearly every country-before that were the massive invasions of Napoleon-before that was a country were you were luck to live to your twentieth birthday and not be killed by Europe's world-famous crowd diseases that spawned from Europe's history of pure squallor and lack of anything that we would today recognize as sanitization. Now Bryson complains about the culture sapping American-style commerialism and disneylandish style tourism. If that Europe's biggest problem all Europeans and travellers should thank thier lucky stars when comparing this with Europe's past history. The Europe Bryson wants is elusive in that Europe may never have been the perfect combination of unseemly commercialism and sanitation that it appears he wants. I gave the book four stars because it is one the few books that I read that made me laugh out loud. It is extremelly well written. Bryson's sense of humor even during the complaint sessions is amazing. I suggest anybody who has ever even thought of Europe to read this immediately.

0446310786|4|I have to admit, this book started off slow. But then towards page fifty I began to understand why this book is so popular. Scout is so young and she doesn't understand much, but she's like most 8-year olds and she thinks fairly and begins to realize that most people are unfair and unjust, and that's just how it is.<br /><br />I liked how her relationship with Jem and Atticus don't really change throughout the book. When most people think of a love story they think of two people falling in love but this is a love story between a young girl and her family.

I didn't want it to end, a beautiful beautiful book
0679805273|5|Great encouraging book for kids arrived on time
B008KYOCA2|5|Actually a tech at Amazon told me about this calendar for my Kindle fire. I think it's useful and fun. You can color code the dates. For example you can use one color for birthdays and another for doctor appointments. There's a large assortment of colors. You can have it remind you of the event a day ahead, or a week or 3 weeks ahead. The fun part is that it comes with icons. You can add a birthday cake to the birthday dates, a heart for anniversaries etc. Also a large assortment of these. If you can't find one you like you can make up one of your own. Really nice app.  .
B0070Y46UY|4|Entertaining and gripping tale. Maybe a little too confusing in a few parts, but overall definitely worth reading.  Hard to put down. Keeps the reader wondering \\"what`s next`?
0670034711|1|Just another self indulgent autobiography.  It was too boring to read and had not much to say.  If you are in for light reading, go for it.  Do not expect too much from this one or you might be very disappointed.

B00TXC4YVW|5|This book offers some good insight into the type of players you will be facing, how to play against these players effectively, and gives good situational examples. Jonathan's book is straight forward, and a quick read that you can knock out in a sitting. There are also a number of other resources to refer to within the book. This book is well worth the buy, it will improve your game, and you'll be glad to have it to refer back to at anytime.

B00G3L6KQI|5|This was a very satisfying book... when is the next one coming out!
031606792X|1|And words clearly escaped Ms. Meyers when she pieced together this book.  Horribly written, almost as if someone else entirely wrote it -- someone who was unfamiliar with the previous three novels in the series.<br /><br />To be clear, I'm not giving it a negative review because I disliked the storyline.  I didn't care for the second book's storyline, but it was still clearly Ms. Meyer's style and thoughts and was, therefore, a respectable book.  This book, however, doesn't even resemble the previous three in the series.  It felt like it was pieced together by a second-rate editor somewhere.  I have a difficult time believing this inferior work was written by Ms. Meyers.<br /><br />I would have rather not read this forth book and left things as they ended in the third book.  An incomplete ending would have been preferable to what I just read.<br /><br />My advice, for those who truly love this series, is to save your money and hope for Midnight Sun, the supposed companion to Twilight, to come out.  Hopefully, Ms. Meyers will actually write Midnight Sun herself and we can have a return to the world of Twilight.
B00JCW0BCY|4|Here's yet another excellent book by Dr. Gawande. He emphasizes the humane and logical aspects of discerning preferable end-of-life options. He spends less time describing the tremendous cost savings these choices would provide under any health care payment plan. That light treatment is appropriate for this book, but it would be a good topic in its own right for an extended essay or another book. Read this before you think you need to, then again approaching a terminal illness or elder care situation.
0739359320|5|John Grisham knows how to write suspenseful and compelling novels.  This was no exception.  I recommend it highly.  A very good read!
B00D7Z4GQY|5|My daughter highly recommended this book, and I trust her editorials. When the story began, it seemed a little predictable, but grew into a terrific plot, weaving the lives of these seemingly unconnected people into a delicious full woven piece of work. The choices we make, the little decisions that seem to be so insignificant, can turn our lives and those around us, into something we couldn't quite imagine. Also speaks to the perceptions we have about people and circumstances, that may or may not be accurate, and the way we gather evidence to support these beliefs, and how distorted our attitudes become, especially since  they may be so far from the truth. I would highly recommend this book to anyone, because just as the plot turns out so far from what we could imagine, life can turn out that way also. It really illustrates how we make judgements and assumptions about people and their behaviors, we really don't know what any individual is really dealing with. The conclusions reached about long term marriage and relationships really make you stop and think..an excellent read!

0393035158|1|After five pages I put this book in my box of books to be sold to the used bookstore. The author would like to reduce our \\"war on terrorism\\" to a fight among religious fanatics--which is a joke. The Russians and Chinese have agreed to try to defuse the terrorism factor in the world and the first thing they emphasized was that problem was not a religious one, but due to politics. Just as in the United States, the Islam leaders use religion to encite their fighters. Read Howard Zinn

0307472841|2|Having only vaguely heard of Henning Mankell, other than in reference to his authorship of the famous Wallander detective series, and trusting good reviews of this book I bought it and read it. Without giving the plot away, I can say that it starts with a chilling crime in the icy north of Sweden, moves to 19th century America, and winds up in Africa before closing somewhat disappointingly in London. It's a good story, although rather too implausible at times, but then a good thriller should above all be a page-turner and this book undoubtedly is. On those merits alone I can recommend it to lovers of the genre. However, had I known in advance that the author is a diehard leftist, I would have refrained from reading this book. I dislike authors who insinuate their political views into the narrative of a novel, catching readers unaware of the fact they are buying a disguised political treatise. Mr. Mankell has every right to be an apologist for the mass murderer Mao (\\"no doubt, mistakes were made\\") or to whitewash Robert Mugabe's rape of Zimbabwe by admiring his anticolonialist zeal (who knew the British were still scheming to recolonize Africa?) but he might show more respect for his readers of detective thrillers by warning them that his work comes laced with a good dose of politics - honey to some, arsenic to others. His anti-Americanism, so salonfähig in Europe and apparently even more in Sweden, moreover is of the clichématic kind, when two of his characters, standing on a porch admiring the landscape, \\"returned indoors as soon as a group of American tourists arrived\\". Of such heady stuff is diehard leftism build these days. No more Maoism from Mr. Mankell for me, thank you. I gave the book away promptly.

B00BZAJMWG|5|This is one of my favorite movies I've seen in a long time.  So amusing, while poignant, too.  The dialogue feels authentic which is rare in a movie.  Cooper is convincing as having a little mental illness.  Every character charms.  Really fresh and engaging.  If you're in the mood for something different, which is upbeat and quirky, you will probably enjoy it.
067144901X|5|Great, short easy read for short attention spans! My 9 month old LOVES it. I can see that it will get old before too long, but not before my daughter is able to join in with the animal sounds. It's also the type of book that an older preschool sibling would like to 'read' to a younger sibling as it is easily memorized.

B000LB7G00|5|Great for CAD work as well as a tool to use for panning in other programs that use 3d or 2d space. DO NOT buy for the intention of using it for gaming. I once had a dream to get this to work in Battlefield 3 and 4 as well as StarCitizen and Elite Dangerous but the unfortunate result is lackluster do to how inaccurate the device tends to be. It does its intended job perfectly though because you only need it to pan around in 3d space.
B002BGFUPQ|5|Thanks
B001AFF25W|3|A quick read with applicable principles that are worth the use. It's a motivating book to a goal oriented person like myself. Now onto doing it.
B00FWLDHSY|5|Based solely upon the trailers I saw before the film was released, I was hoping this would be an action-packed, special effects extravaganza and it lived up to expectations.  One could argue that some of the acting is over-the-top but I would counter that the acting almost has to be exaggerated in order to keep pace with the elaborate special effects and intense storyline.
B009329ZF2|3|A no thought needed movie to just sit back and be entertained by the recidivous. You have seen this premiss hundreds of times but somehow it still strikes an inner cord...the good guy wins.

B002G1YPH0|4|The installation instructions are not very detailed so it takes a little creative thinking to get past a couple of parts.  I had no idea how much tension to put on the screws, either, but it seems like I guess right!<br /><br />This was not a new build but a replacement for a noisy/sub-par stock cooling system from AMD.  I had to remove my MB to attach the mounting plate, and that part wasn't a lot of fun.  It is also a VERY tight fit in my mid-tower case - i definitely suggest measuring your case before committing to this project.<br /><br />Two weeks later, I'm happy with it.  It's quiet and vastly superior to the old, stock cooling system that I replaced with it.  Phenom X6 is stable at 47c with full CPU load (via prime95) and there is no increase in fan noise at all.  Works great!
B000002I7R|5|&quot;Pictures at Eleven&quot; appears like 'a solo album from that guy from Led Zeppelin' type of deal, rather than a singer trying to find a voice. Perhaps he wasn't sure if zeppelin were on hiatus or something. This disc succeeds at presenting Robert as he was at the time, not really trying to cash in on zep or move away too fast. The perfect balance between retaining an indentity as a solo artist and acknowledging your past as 1/4 of Led Zeppelin. Additionally, unlike Plant's future work, there are really no dogs or bombs or stinkers or awkward moments (e.g.-&quot;If I were a carpentar&quot; cover). To each his own, I suppose; but I enjoy this album. Not comfortable to admit it, but I like  especially &quot;slow dancer&quot;, &quot;Moonlight in Samosa&quot; and &quot;Fat Lip&quot;(sp?)...The best all around Plant effort. He sounds as if he wrote songs for a band with him being 1/4 member, much in the vein of Led Zeppelin's approach, which contrasts to his &quot;solo star w/ backing band style&quot; of later years. Good for fans of zep and other zep members too.

B000A2IPP0|5|I first saw this movie at my mom's parents' back when I was about seven. It wasn't until my mom bought us a copy after we returned home that I became quite literally obsessed with the movie. Like many kids I dreamed of flying away on an alien spaceship, perhaps even to E.T's home planet. We have far too many movies in which aliens come to Earth with the sole purpose of enslaving if not annihilating us. E.T. and his fellows came to Earth, presumably as botanists, to collect samples of our soil and plant life for study. Frightened into flight by the FBI, these explorers accidentally leave one of their number behind, where he is later found and befriended by Eliot, a young, lonely boy from a broken home. As time passes, Eliot begins to form a psychic bond with the alien, at one point going so far as to disrupt a science class by trying to free a collection of frogs slated for disection. In the meantime, E.T. learns to talk with the aid of Eliot's younger sister Gertie and begins building a communication device to try to call his people so that he can return home. Things become more desperate however when E.T. becomes deathly ill, due no doubt to the separation from his own species and possibly to the polluted atmosphere of Earth, not to mention the untimely and unwanted appearance of the FBI agents who, unbeknownced to the family, have been running surveillance on their house since the alien's arrival.    One of the things that stand out most for me about this film is its musical score. Who could forget E.T's classic theme? The Atari 2600's rendition of said theme was, to put it simply, horrible, as was the game itself. The film's score is perfectly suited to it however, and it alone is powerful enough to evoke waves of memories anytime I hear it. It certainly did when my high school's band played a portion of it, that portion used during E.T's last flight, during an assembly. However I must say that I wholeheartedly agree with a lot of people who have reviewed this film. Though I might have liked to see a sequel, it's probably just as well that one was never made. As much as I like Spielberg, he probably wouldn't have done the original justice if he had tried to do a sequel. Sometimes you just don't do that. And in any case the story of the film didn't really leave room for adding on, so attempting to do so would probably have been an unqualified disaster.
B00005JKLZ|1|This movie made me want to invent a time machine, travel back in time, and prevent myself from seeing this movie.
B003XF1XOQ|5|I loved this book just like the others, all of the twist and turns that kept me guessing and wanting more. The only problem is that I still want more!

0123694965|5|I'm an amateur game designer, and I love this book!  Schell does an amazing job of helping game designers ask the questions that they need to ask in order to design good games!  But that's not all!  This book is also a very, very fun read!  And I believe that it would be beneficial for just about anyone trying to create an entertainment-based product to read this book!
1607747308|4|I consider myself a minimalist and yet, after reading this book, I realized I was still holding onto stuff I don’t need.  Thanks to this author, I got rid of things that don’t bring me joy, like abandoned books and spare buttons that come with new pants.  The biggest change was how much paper I got rid of.  I’d been struggling to find the right organizer for my papers when really, I could just get rid of them.  Besides decluttering, the author also tackles organizing what’s left.  I found this part less inspiring since if you’ve seriously decluttered, you probably don’t need organizers at all.  However, sometimes you do and in that case, I think something more attractive than shoe boxes would bring joy.  The author stresses being grateful for what you have and I agree you should.  However, I couldn’t relate to kneeling before my house every day, or completely emptying my purse every day, or not rolling my socks because it hurts their feelings (I actually don’t roll socks because they're all identical, so there's no need).  I’d rather reserve this much care to people, not things.
0553382179|4|Sink Reflections is a fun, lighthearted read that will inspire anyone to take better care of herself and her home. The get-organized program she recommends is perfect for people who are paralyzed by perfection, (e.g. you never clean because you don't have time to do it \\"the right way\\"). <br /> <br />If, however, you're more like me and your problem is that you're chronically sidetracked (e.g. you start cleaning the living room but end up reading an old magazine you came across instead) then I highly recommend Pam Young and Peggy Jones' book Sidetracked Home Executives. Their method for getting organized was a much better fit for my easily-distracted, procrastinating self and is exactly what I needed to get control of my home and get organized.
B006XF5BTG|5|The main reasons for this are:<br />1) Explains many myths that I didn't know. For example, overload causes muscle growth and not fatigue. In other words, there is no point in doing 30 reps with lightweights.<br />2) He gives a lot of scientific explanation. However, he doesn't always give proof of this, but it does make sense. You learn how your body works and not only what to do.<br />3) Gives you detailed workout plans and diets for both bulking and cutting.<br />4) Tells you the truth about it, and tells you the truth about supplements.<br />4) THIS IS THE BIG ONE. He is present on forums like bodybuilding and you can contact him through his e-mail account, with any questions and he answers right back. Just yesterday night I sent him 8 questions, and they were all answered by the morning of the next day. I've seen people show him their full diet plan, which is simply great. AND FREE. I've tried Tom Venuto's book, which was good, but was filled with a load of BS nobody wants to hear. This is pretty straightforward. Moreover, Venuto didn't have that follow up for free.<br /><br />I would have given it a 4 if it weren't for the fact you can talk to him anytime. Totally worth the price.

B0073LWEXK|5|This is a fun although challenging adventure game and a very beautiful game also. While it is easy to get a little turned around and lost I thought that just added to the challenge of the game. I don't want these games to be too easy..
B004XUMMFE|5|The only thing I don't like about it (the obvious thing) was that it was cancelled!<br />The cast, the plots, the characters are all wonderful.
B004LQGXPA|5|Not yet viewed, I rate it 5 star based on what others told me when they saw the movie years ago...and George C. Scott was a VERY good actor, so sure he did a fine job in this film.  I will not rate others not yet viewed, as I have no opinion on them.  iT MAY BE WEEKS IF NOT MONTHS BEFORE i HAVE THE TIME TO WATCH THEM.
B007X4ECLY|4|I think what surprises me about this film isn't that it's a reboot of 'Escape From LA' with a drop of '[[ASIN:B00004REZS Fortress 2]]' in the mix. Nope, it's that nearly every reviewer at this point - July 2012 - mistakenly (gleefully?) saddles this production onto the shoulders of Luc Besson.<br /><br />Unless egos have seriously dropped in Hollywood, laughably unlikely, the credit and/or failing goes to Co-Directors James Mather and Stephen St. Leger.<br /><br />Not sure how, beyond a co-writing and non-executive producer credit, Besson was remotely involved with this project?<br /><br />Interesting.<br /><br />A decently fun flick that delivers what it promises. However, the plot holes in 'Lockout' are fairly numerous, enough to distract from making this a solid plus in the genre.<br /><br />Per the standard requisite for male actors nowadays, Pierce really packed on the muscle for the role and honestly looks fantastic. Appreciated that the co-directors allowed the character to casually wear the weight without having to resort to a shirtless scene, which can be tacky if delivered out of context, and presumably only for female exhortation. Clearly, this isn't a chick flick.<br /><br />What also lessened my appreciation is that I'm not a fan of Maggie Grace. First viewed in tv's '[[ASIN:B00005JNOG Lost]]' and followed her career through various roles. And truthfully, I haven't screened a production where I felt she captured her character, bringing it to life or challenging viewers with a strong interpretation. This role is no exception. Pretty much another walk-through static effort. Unsure if this is a directorial issue or one of thespian inability. I feel there's a spark of the craft somewhere in there, and she showed a bit of it in '[[ASIN:B002PNKX48 The Fog]]', but I have yet to see it revealed on a big stage.<br /><br />As mentioned previously, there were quite a few plot incongruities and meandering threads.<br /><br />Examples:<br /><br />- It's never made clear whether the President is a deeply caring father willing to do what it takes to save his daughter; or if he's a disinterested spectator as suggested by Maggie's character, Emilie, who implies he's a shallow opportunist willing to sacrifice everything for political capital. As President Warnock showcases both positions, that made the high-risk rescue seem completely empty, with no real authority or sense of urgency, but simply an excuse to throw in CGI battle scenes.<br /><br />- And speaking of which, the rescue itself was ill conceived. Lack of any military experience showing here - as there's no breach team. At least not one that's either indicated by the National Intelligence Director or by simply filming them preparing for their mission. Fifteen seconds of film would have been all it took for either scenario, allowing us a semblance of a fully developed plot.<br /><br />- Minor spoilers, but the sidestory of Mace and The Briefcase seemed rather pointless given that we're never privy to the true impact of the contents. We don't need to know what's in the case, but we do need a better sense of how it plays into the overall main plot. Since it apparently doesn't - there's no satisfactory resolution from a viewer's perspective.<br /><br />-  If the math is correct, what was the deal with the other 490-something prisoners? Other than beating the crap out of the jailhouse rats - what were they doing besides standing around? Weren't any of them interested in, you know, attempting to make their own escape?<br /><br />Anyway, again a decent update of John Carpenter's work, with Guy Pierce doing a pretty decent Snake Plissken. I like to think another Mace Snow adventure is possible, but Box Office Mojo's tally numbers seem to suggest otherwise. Unfortunate. They did a pretty bang-up job with only $20 million in the budget.<br /><br />Personal Note: I'm a monster fan of both character actors Peter Stomare and Lenny James, so I was very pleased to see the pair on the big screen.g screen.

0440243661|5|Jack Reacher is one of my all time favorite heroes and this book tells another story of his adventures.  Unfortunately the author allowed a 5'7&#34; 170 pound actor to portray Jack Reacher in a 2012 movie.  Jack Reacher is 6'5&#34; tall with a 50-inch chest, and weighs between 220 and 250 pounds.  No way that actor could portray the sheer power and ferociousness of the much bigger man.  I feel the author, who wrote of his approval of the actor, sold his loyal fan base out and I haven't bought another Lee Child book since.<br /><br />I use Amazon for most of my purchases and update my reviews if anything changes with the products.

It relates to today in serveral ways, but at the same time casting an evil...shaddow upon our world how it is. I recommend this book to teenagers just trying to understand what's going on with everything.
B004W1GCNC|4|Good character roles and great actors  Great story. Very intense You glued to the series. Always waiting for more to come out.
006202406X|5|All 3 books were a total page turner. Must read!  I wish there were more to come. Well written. Kudos to the author
B00IG2DOKM|5|Easy and fun to play. Has lots of growth potential for long term gaming.
B00KG2SXII|3|Overrated, don't take into consideration the high score that rottentomatoes gives to its movies. Most of the times it doesn't make sense. It wouldn't be that mediocre if I hadn't really high expectations from the high tomatoscore and if I hadn't compared it with PACIFIC RIM. There is a huge gap between the two and no matter what ,you inevitably have to compare the two. Godzilla loses in all points by far!!! It was maybe the weakest blockbuster, high budget movie I saw the last two years.<br /><br />The story is ok, after all its a Godzilla movie but as in all destruction movies the plots are simple and the characters plain which serve only in completing the story, not ruling the story. There was no cliffhangers  and after a while the whole movie seemed like clich&eacute;. The first 30 minutes where ok. It went boring afterwards. Many times I thought that the first Godzilla was better than this one.<br /><br />So if you have seen Pacific Rim you might like Godzilla but even if you leave the story and characters aside ( which in P.R are way better even if Bryan Cranston is great in his part) the images, fights, monsters and the whole directorial skills are just amazing in Pacific Rim. There is no comparison. It's like comparing aliens to species, or the titanic to Poseidon!! Yes the difference is that big. de toro should direct the boring Hobbit movie.<br /> If you haven't seen Pacific Rim just watch and compare
B003PIUBZS|4|I like this series, it's a little heavy on the cartoon blood and not moves it plot at a snail's pace, but every episode in and of itself is very well done and very impressive.
B00NEQRNVG|5|Waaaaahhhhh!!!! Why does it have to end!!!  I'm mad because I finished the book, frustrated because I need to read more,  but happy and giddy because it ended on a semi-good note with Gideon and Eva. Now I have to wait who knows how long for the next book. Grrrrrr!!! Love, love me some Gideon!!!!
B0015AARJI|5|This controller is about as good as it gets! I am completely satisfied with it and will purchase another in the future!!
0790730960|4|Incredibly lavish, exquisitely moody, often extremely dark sequel takes a sardonic look at the Caped Crusader and a pair of emotionally tormented villains, the poignant (and mean) Penguin and the sultry, conflicted  Catwoman, both played brilliantly by Danny DeVito and the terrific Michelle  Pfeiffer. Christopher Walken also arrives as scheming Max Shreck (named  after the vampire in \\"Nosferatu\\") to assist them in their dire plans. The  plot moves crisply for about an hour, until it disappointingly falls apart  in the scattershot second half.  The film suffers from an often  mean-spirited tone, and with too few appearances by Batman himself  throughout, the story revolves around the villains rather than the hero.   Much of the action is so intense and emotional, the film can be a bit  depressing at times to watch, especially for younger viewers, part of its  target audience.  Still, there are too many juicy elements in this visually  overpowering fantasy to ignore; they're all so masterfully directed by Tim  Burton, who stamps each scene with his one-of-a-kind wizardry. The picture  is simply a marvel to look at, and does that rare thing in cinema: it  creates a world so real that stems deep within the abyss of the  imagination, so consistently impressive and truly warrants the overused  term, \\"dazzling.\\" The best visual touch is setting the film at Christmas  time, with snowy, ice-glazed visuals providing the perfect compliment to  the extraordinary visual deign by Bo Welch, creating a giant snow-globe  with a pulse.  A bold attempt has been made to make the villains into  victims, not simply evil monsters, and Michael Keaton's second (and final)  donning of the cape and cowl is a strong one. The technical credits, which  include opulent costume designs, Danny Elfman's exquisite scoring art and  Stefan Czapsky's masterful cinematography, are simply indelible. Despite  many imperfections, pic is the most unique, bizarre, and original  installment in this uneven series.
B005U9REU0|5|Because this was one of my favorite movies when I was young and was excited to find it and be able to share it with my 7 yr old who also seemed to enjoy it as well.
B00004T9UF|5|This new cd by slim shady is tight.  The skits are hilarious, the lyrics are clever and harsh, the beats incredible, and em's flow is great.  every track has a catchy hook, and i like how the majority of the tracks feature  shady solo.  however, the track that features dre, snoop, nate dogg and  exibit is incredible as well.  eminem improves with his second release, and  everyone should pick this cd up.

B008220CFG|5|Viewers, readers! Help me find the official Jewish exorcism text(s)! Got a lead on the official Jewish binding and exorcism rituals, enter the(ir) title(s) as a comment to this request.<br /><br />Here's the official Roman Catholic Exorcism text:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0012U5R9G The Roman Ritual [Rituale Romanum]: Vol 2: Christian Burial, Exorcism, Reserved Blessings, etc [Latin/English]]]<br /><br />This movie sure is scary alright! I'm buying multiple copies of it for my collection.<br /><br />I won't say too much about the synopsis of this movie as you can read it elsewhere. In summary, this movie it's about a box containing an evil spirit that was bound by Jewish binding rituals. An unsuspecting girl, Emily, opens the box and gets possessed. Strange disturbances occur in the house. The daddy grows desperate in searching for answers that leads him to a Hasidic Jewish community. Although the storyline is simple enough, the drama such is tense and scary! Watch this movie in a theater and you could be jumping out of your seat!<br /><br />I'm collecting this movie because it is based on a true story, stories rather. Such things are quite common, even though they're never acknowledged by the general public.<br /><br />This movie will teach everyone a lesson: do NOT ever buy ancient, antique, curious items from unknown sellers, especially those that come with unknown inscriptions that cannot be traced to a safe and reliable source.<br /><br />The story in this movie is not something new to me, I've personally heard such stories from elsewhere. This is a reason why I went to watch this scary movie.<br /><br />Sorry to say this, but this is also not the first time I hear of most Jews refusing to exorcise a possessed person out of fear, as seen in the movie. So, what would I advise the daddy in this movie to do? If the Jews are reluctant to deal with their own rituals, go find a real Catholic priest (not those Liberal unbelievers)! For serious cases like the one you see in this movie, it is not advisable to do the ritual on your own like what the daddy tried to do in this movie.<br /><br />If victims like this Emily character is looking for a lasting solution to her afflictions, the only solution is to turn to the Catholic Church for answers. However, applying for an official exorcism in the Catholic Church could take months for formal approval as the applicant is being checked out and examines by secular medical community and then by the ecclesiastical authorities. There are many reasons for this seemingly bureaucratic process. The Church has had enough of its skeptical and time-wasting scoffers. In the majority of cases, most common applicants need not have a formal exorcism in the first place. Most afflicted applicants give up before they even begin. Compound the bureaucratic process with the fact that the current establishment is Liberal, you'd just have to find a listening ear by looking for a validly ordained Conservative or Traditional priest. There are also the informal rites that an applicant could seek out within the Roman Catholic Church. The Roman Catholic Church has had over 2000 years of historical experience in these things, why find your solutions elsewhere?<br /><br />The Jews (among others) may bind evil spirits to objects (eg. boxes) to be discarded or buried (posing a danger to an unsuspecting finder); the Catholic Church sends these evil spirits back to Hell. Now, which solution do YOU think is safer for the victim?<br /><br />The prayers in the following books are useful:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000Z1UL5S Roman Ritual, Weller (Rituale Romanum, Full Set of three Volumes)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0312977379 Beware the Night]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0895551969 St. Michael and the Angels:  A Month With St. Michael and the Holy Angels]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0898707102 An Exorcist Tells His Story]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0898709172 An Exorcist: More Stories]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0061238171 The Dark Sacrament: True Stories of Modern-Day Demon Possession and Exorcism]]<br /><br />Case studies:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0895550989 Begone Satan]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0595246184 The Demonologist: The Extraordinary Career of Ed and Lorraine Warren]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:006065337X Hostage to the Devil: The Possession and Exorcism of Five Contemporary Americans]]session and Exorcism]]<br /><br />Case studies:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0895550989 Begone Satan]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0595246184 The Demonologist: The Extraordinary Career of Ed and Lorraine Warren]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:006065337X Hostage to the Devil: The Possession and Exorcism of Five Contemporary Americans]]
B0052U59F4|5|This book is amazing! It had a great plot and detailed romance! A must read trilogy! Love it! 5 stars!!!
B00BB8SKPW|2|Predictably boring way to long
B00LTI5GNS|3|I like the exterior color very much but I think the interior color would be better if it were darker.  I will consider that when I buy another cover.  DeLane
B004OZOTSQ|5|Works terrific to transfer files between my Fire and PC. Love it! Gets the job done easily. Well worth it.
B0042FZOFU|5|Can't beat all three for the price. Im not one for Bluray and Animation, DVD is fine in my opinion. But when you can get all three for what you pay for maybe two in DVD... You can't go wrong.
B00GRVEDCM|5|Really love the graphics and the game itself. Sad thing that money can definitely assure victory and it's money I don't have. #college student
B0033H7VI6|5|Really an excellent knife, especially for the money. It's beefy, solid with a good size grip on it too. Blade holds up well and keeps a good edge. Just need to keep it dry,clean and the blade lightly oiled when not in use, and it will be a great all around working and survival companion for years. A truly solid knife for the money.
B006LSZECO|5|I could not put it down, it toyed with my emotions and left me hanging at every turn! I highly recommend this book to everyone!
B00H58VGIA|5|Even better than The Secret Life of Bees.  Her descriptions of life in the deep south and the conditions for the Slaves  was so heartbreaking.  No wonder the blacks of today resent the white population after what happened to their ancestors.  Great read.
0316069884|4|as a jonathan safran foer fan and a vegan i liked this book. it gave a lot of information about factory farming in a really down-to-earth, easy to read format, which was nice. he gives a disclaimer in the beginning that it's not necessarily a pro-vegetarian book and that's definitely true; he was pretty neutral throughout the book. personally i like a lot more passion in books regarding animal rights and diets but i did learn a ton of hard facts to back up my beliefs about both things. absolutely worth reading.
B00QW8TYWO|5|Such a fun way to spend time!!!
1476734941|5|I saw the PBS show where Dr. Mosley shared his findings and results. After lifelong dieting I had the courage to give this a try. I started last June and at my last doctor's visit in March I was down 20 lbs. My husband started it and he is losing weight also. He told me he could now wear work pants that he formerly could not get into. Both of us are over 65 and losing weight at our age is not easy. The book has the information I saw on TV and more, plus some receipes and other hints. The text is in British English but not difficult to read. For myself I must say that on my nonFAST days I eat normally but I never eat everything I want. The miracle is that I don't really like that stuffed feeling any more and after a few weeks of effort I look forward to my FAST days.
B00GLQQ07E|5|I have some dissapointing parts but not enough to make it four star it sounds like they took songs from movie itself and put it on cd itself I expected some songs to be little longer but its great can not wait to buy movie when its released in song IN SUMMER like version im going to tell him in film glad they included that part on cd.<br /><br />there is a lot of instrumental music on 2disk set you don't classical music save yourself time trouble listen to tracks before purchasing 2 disk set and buy only single tracks if your person who is buying this for singing only<br /><br />I had buy download version walmart is only place that selles 2 disk set an usual walmart never has what I was looking for I buy download copy from amazon included all 32 songs would have liked it included download cd booklet cover back and front that transfromers dark of moon cd soundtrack included when bought from amazon mp3 download section, it does not
B00K196IV0|4|It's great besides the fact that it has to much bugs and is a little repetitive but is great<br />I would consider buying this game
B00EKXDVOK|2|I really like Streisand.  I think she's has the best voice of all.  However, this CD is, well, boring.  All the songs but one are sang in a very slow, boring tempo.  The one that is not is over-the-top the other way around.
B0047Y0FGY|5|Everything you would expect. I laughed the entire way through. I will now begin to emulate my life completely after hers.
B00IDI7WP2|4|Everything is Awesome! You can't get better than that. However the beginning of the movie was a bit spastic but got really good after the first 10 minutes. The Kids including myself loved it to the end. I can't believe how many famous people were in the movie. Only the Kragle AKA Crazy Glue can stop them. I recommend buying it since the kids will want to watch it over and over.<br /><br />&#34;Anything that makes them stop singing, &#34;Let it Go!&#34; is good in my book&#34;. - Brian Schoedel
B00HYTLY64|1|The quality of the HD download from Amazon prime was so poor we ended up not being able to watch the movie.
B008Y2FRFO|5|This is a good way to spend some alone time and relax. It keeps me on my toes  and is great fun.
B00475AYJQ|5|Great read. Couldn't put it down! He is highly underrated as compared with other fantasy authors, but should soon make his own lasting mark.
B00DVKOYBM|5|I enjoy this game
0399162097|4|Good book, it kept me turning the pages to find out more.  Definitely a unique topic and worth a read.
B00VFTCGES|4|This one you need to watch twice...makes you think..loved it!
B00IJJUIMY|5|Connelly did it again.  Kept me up to my ears in these cases, and has me watching out the window for the next Harry Bosch story.  Ya gotta love a cop like that!!!
B0006L16N8|5|X&Y is Coldplay's third and best album, which is saying a lot considering the excellence of their first two.  Listening to this album it is easy to see how Coldplay has evolved over the years.  You can tell that Coldplay knew they had to put out the best album of the year and they delivered. <br /> <br />Square One - 10/10 - A great way to kick off the album, with a cool chorus that lets you know that Coldplay is back. <br /> <br />What If - 8/10 - A solid Coldplay song with lyrics that are the \\"antithesis of Lennon's Imagine.\\" <br /> <br />White Shadows - 10/10 - One of the best on the album, this song has a great 80's feel to it.  Also a great buildup to an amazing chorus, this song sounds great live. <br /> <br />Fix You - 10/10 - Perhaps the best song to come out this year, a very moving piece, especially the end with the guitar and 4-part harmony.  \\"The Scientist\\" of X&Y. <br /> <br />Talk - 9/10 - A great take on a Kraftwerk riff, this song fits well with the rest of the album. <br /> <br />X&Y - 6/10 - Probably the weakest song on the record, but the chorus is good. <br /> <br />Speed Of Sound - 10/10 - The excellent first single reminiscent of Clocks but an entirely different song and better in my opinion.  You just can't get the piano riff and chorus out of your head. <br /> <br />A Message - 10/10 - A simple but great song about longing for someone.  Especially like it when Jonny's guitar kicks in at the bridge. <br /> <br />Low - 9/10 - Described as \\"Coldplay's fastest and heaviest song,\\" it took awhile to grow on me but it's well done. <br /> <br />The Hardest Part - 10/10 - An easily overlooked song on the record, but I like the piano and guitar, and the heartbreaking lyrics got to me the first time I heard them. <br /> <br />Swallowed In The Sea - 9/10 - Another gem on this CD, a simple love song with lyrics like \\"I could write a song/A hundred miles long/Well that's where I belong/And you belong with me.\\" <br /> <br />Twisted Logic - 7/10 - Not as strong as the other tracks. <br /> <br />Till Kingdom Come - 10/10 - The hidden track, stands out from the rest because of its folk/country feel, but a great love song that describes how many of us have felt at one time or another. <br /> <br />I'm not the kind of reviewer who throws out 10's like hot cakes, so the fact that this album has several 10's shows how great it is.  I usually get tired of music rather quickly, but I bought this CD on day one and it has still not left my CD player.  Highly recommended, this is by far the best CD to come out this year.
0765367351|5|awesome prequel to the game!!<br />A must read for Bioshock fans!!!!
B000M4RG42|5|Acting & directing superbly displayed
B007J4T2G8|1|just a few words, as I agree to the hundreds of similar reviews. Poorly written book, you would think this is written by a teenager. The characters are not well thought through: Ana is only 21 but soo  very mature in handling a seriously disturbed man, she is a virgin but then again so \\"adaptable\\" to her unconventional boyfriend. On the other hand, Christian Grey is only 27 but a business tycoon, great piano player, looking great and so knowledgeable etc etc... I could go on and on. Somehow this book got famous, just by describing some kinky s*x and through word of mouth everybody believes it must be good enough to be read. t would be just a story invented by teenage girls day dreaming...  if you are interested in reading some kinky books this is one you can find easily.
B001MYIXAW|5|The best movie in a long time. A different vision and way to tell a tale. The whole product it´s very strong and full of talent, from the directing, actors, music, locations, And the story itself it´s fantastic. Don´t you leave this movie, perhaps in a short time nobady told you about it because is not from Hollywood. It´s just a masterpiece.
B00K2CHW48|1|Original 50's Godzilla fan - This remake is remarkably awful.<br /><br />How do you completely mess up a Godzilla move? How is that even possible?<br /><br />Greatest movie monster of all time and the film makers did a good job rendering him.<br /><br />Great Actors. ( They did the best they could )<br /><br />Great Sets and production values. ( The craftsmen and women did a great job )<br /><br />The cinematography was poor. This is down to the director requiring night scenes so dark it's hard to see what's going on.<br /><br />Yet somehow, with the best possible resources the film makers managed to blow it. The failure is in the script. The human characters needed to present the story and thanks to the script writers this was poorly done and several aspects of it made no sense.<br /><br />The clearest example of this is the fact that this is supposed to be a film about Godzilla, you know, the headline guy, not some unnamed bug-bat looking thing. ( did they name it? I missed that if they did )  Yet we don't see our favorite super lizard (if indeed he is a lizard) until close to half way through the movie.<br /><br />The 1998 remake was far superior to this.
B00AZM7IQC|5|Love this, looks great on my 3d tv.  Have watched it several times very relaxing and just  breathtaking. We really enjoy it.
B0054JZC6E|5|Very addictive and fun one of my favorite apps, works very well on the kindle fire. would recommend to friends.
1559409002|5|<br />Gallons of ink have been devoted, (justifiably) to this film. But few have perhaps paid sufficient due to the cinematographer, Maurice Prather. <br /> <br />Mr. Prather aids and abets the script at every turn in his rendering of Miss Hilligoss's (in the role of Mary Henry) isolation from those around her. From his crow's nest shots of her wandering through the deserted carnival to the scenes of her lone sedan traversing the twilight prairie highway, he unfailingly delivers a picture of un-peopled vastness--a vastness that cannot be breached by human or psychic outreach. <br /> <br />And that is what this film is really about--Mary Henry's inability to accept the fact that she has already departed from the world she continues to haunt. <br /> <br />Ultimately she knows, (as does her personal Charon--the Carnival Ghoul) that she must be reclaimed--and it is in her persistent refusal to yield to his summons, from which the conflict and tension of the film springs. <br /> <br />This is perhaps revealed most disquietingly in a scene near the beginning of the film, when the minister accompanies her to take a look at the abandoned carnival--but refuses to accompany her across the barricade. Thus, though the visit is without ostensible horrific incident--it concludes with a silhouette of the Carnival Ghoul dropping his head in resignation from behind a gated doorway inside the pavilion, while at the very same moment, Miss Hilligoss, (seemingly safe in a car already miles away) is stabbed with a sudden deja vu--reflected with a rueful knowing in her eyes--one of many brilliant moments in a film brimming with them. <br /> <br />And it should not merely be to the cognoscente that such an inevitable moment as this, terrifies far more meaningfully, than any knife wielding Friday the 13th slasher might. <br /> <br />As to Mr. Prather, note how similar are the contrast and tone levels he uses to depict the vast American mid-western landscapes under over-cast skies, to thatused by Sven Nykvist in Bergman's \\"Winter Light.\\" Though the Bergman film is set in Sweden--surely the similarity is not coincidental. <br /> <br />Indeed, some scenes call to mind Caspar David Friedrich, as in the shot of Mary on the sandbar approaching her rescuers on the bridge--a heart in your mouth visual if there ever was one.  <br /> <br />This is your comment, you may delete or edit it.     <br />  <br />
B00AF6MF9I|4|Good game server issues suck.  Got to level 41 then deleted to stop load issue at 34%.  Get lost in playing.
B000B5XOXY|5|Batman Forever is pretty good only because of the villians. Jim carrey basically made that show, with a little help from Tommy Lee Jones. This movie was meant for jim carrey. because he could go nuts. just like the character. he was perfect for the part. & tommy lee jones did a pretty good job with Two-Face.  Val Kilmer was okay as batman & Chris o'Donnell as robin, i think they rushed that. he was okay but i think they could of found someone better. but all in all the movie was enjoyable. if you like batman then you have to see this one. It's a Must see
B007SGLZP8|4|Good read, good page turner however found lead character 7/10 likability.  Gave up on his family too easy, especially his son, plus he got those two pilots fired
B000QCS8TW|5|One of the best series of books I've read. I'm watching the series on TV now and am learning important backround information from the books.
B0050AV5MW|5|These are great. My dad and I are loving the kindle version after watching the TV series. The story is gripping and flows along at a lovely pace. I can't wait to read past what has been shown on TV. There is so much to read - really good value for money (especially on the kindle version).
B00AE9UYJ4|4|Ok so I was just playing slender man so I was looking for the last sign on the farm when all of a sudden I fall through the world. Please fix this. Otherwise this game is great!!
B00IWZNYTE|4|A great read ! Funny at times , agonising at other times . Doug is an eternal optimist , stifled by his upbringing but wanting to be so much more for his family . Well written and engaging .
B001LF4IA6|4|I love Bruce Springsteen and the East Street Band...I've seen his concerts more than anyone else's and I have all his CD's. Before the CD Working On A Dream, came out I started with the very first album I bought<br />by Bruce and listened to everything. I LOVE his earliest works and Darkness on the Edge of Town remains my FAVORITE. Still, I respect him enough to realize he is wring and recording different music from then today and he is a lot older. As a fifty something guy myself, I can relate. If you listen hrd to this CD, you still can hear Bruce. I'd hate it, if I got a retread of Born to Run or USA...Too many artists today try to look back, and just can't go back...I'm glad he's nmot trying ecept in concert of course. Thsi CD does not disappoint unless you want to look backwards...It's precious.<br />  My only complaint....I don't like the media hype for it...I feel like<br />Bruce should speak for himself....  Atreides
B002QW7ALM|4|For a while I wasn't sure if I was going to stick with the movie.  It seemed to be an odd mishmash of Alien meets Saw meets the Cube trilogy, and I don't totally buy Dennis Quaid in a sci fi horror movie.  But I stuck with it because I wanted to see what had gone wrong and how these humans were going to get out of this mess, trapped as they are on a ship with murderous creatures on board that were never supposed to be there.<br /><br />It turned out to be worth it.  Without ruining the ending, I will just say that it worked out logically and still had a good twist which was not at all predictable.
B00N1JQ2UO|5|Perfect!
B004SCRDCY|5|daughter loved this book.  stocking stuffer
B004SJ3BCI|5|It is so hard to stop once I begin t o play.  Imagine, as old as I am......late at night flinging birds into structures to kill ugly little pigs !!!  What is wrong with me........lol............
0140186409|4|I read Grapes of Wrath just out of interest when I saw it sitting on a bookstore shelf, it wasn't part of my school ciriculum or anything of the sort. I found it was not really entertaining and at times it's not really a page turner, but you will want to read till the end to see what happens.<br />The problem I have with GoW is that it repeats the same monotonous message over and over again. The same lesson, the same insight, the same issue. While this may be effective in driving home to the reader the fact that the migrant situation during the depression had a far reaching and catastrophic impact on certain americans and the segregation there was in the community, I just wish I didn't need to know the same details constantly.<br />Steinbeck did do a great job of creating a wonderfully written (sometimes poetic, especially inbetween chapters) story with wonderful characters but I do see areas where there could have been improvement. There is little description in a characters actions or movements. While you may feel what the character is going through, it can be a little more difficult to 'see' whats going on as Steinbeck was sparse with descriptions. If that's his writing style then so be it, I didn't really like that about the novel.<br />GoW throws the reader through problem after problem, with only the strength of will of Tom and his mother keeping the family glued together, you do feel the injustice and hardships that they experienced, and the vain hope that they can obtain a piece of land.<br />The ending is a bit of a mystery to me, I can't quite catch the metaphor in the last scene but I do see how it works overall. Anyway, if you are interested in tasting a bit of classic work, read GoW. You'll come away satisfied.
B009ZQC7MY|5|Mose series weaken in time, Downton Abeby had been the exception until now.  I felt it was all over the place, trying to include too much in one episode.  Still one of the best show on TV.
B00FAX6XQC|5|Great game to entertain all ages! Keeps you occupied. Very challenging at times. Can get enough of this game. No purchases needed before or during the game. This is the best version I've found so far.
B002KCNV70|4|Another great gift for my husband.<br />He is the Lego/Star Wars enthusiast in our household.<br />Joins his collection of Star Wars Lego.
0141197536|5|In this edition, I found that the Foreword by Martin Amis revealed too much about the book, though I appreciated that whenever he transcribed an excerpt from the book he added the meaning of the slang terms between brackets. Since I had never read the book or watched the movie, I had no idea what I was getting myself into and, when reading those bits, that is exactly what I wondered - what have I got myself into?<br /><br />The introduction by Andrew Biswell proceeds to mention what influenced Burgess when researching for A Clockwork Orange, including a few dystopian novels of his time. I found some quite interesting myself and am wondering if I still can get copies.<br />It also mentions the initial reactions to the novel when it first came out and its impact, including but not limited to how it influenced different artists. It contains a lot of inside info, which I believe true fans of this work will appreciate it. And, let's not forget, it's the full book as written initially by Burgess, containing that wretched last chapter which so many found uncharacteristic to the persona of Alex.<br /><br />Now... Regarding the book itself. I have to admit it is probably the most disturbing book I have ever read. I cannot even fathom how twisted a mind needs to be to come up with the things written here. The brilliancy of creating a whole new vocabulary is obvious. Mixing it with such formal and dated, almost Shakespearean expressions was also very interesting. It gave the impression of Alex being much older than 15 and that he had the potential to be anything he wanted, but he chose to be that and do those things, and that is kind of the point of the book, that goodness is a choice.<br /><br />But the amount of violence described here is just unbelievable, especially in Part 1. The book makes you so uncomfortable because it speaks of everything you don't want to think about or even know exists out there. Stealing, beating, raping, child molesting, taking away your free will, etc., etc; practically any bad thing you can think of is approached in this book.<br /><br />For all that and more I cannot mention because I am still baffled and it was quite a ride, the 5 stars are well deserved. Even though I felt physically sick while reading it, or because of it, the fact is this book is unique when it comes to making the reader feel.<br /><br />As for the ending, I can understand why people, including Burgess, are not so keen on the last chapter and how it feels off character. I don't know how long occurred between the end of chapter 6 and beginning of 7, but the changes are just too sudden. (view spoiler)<br /><br />This edition also includes Notes explaining certain phrases found in the book; the full Nadsat glossary; a prologue written for Burgess's musical stage version for A Clockwork Orange, depicting Alex and his girlfriend as Adam and Eve; an epilogue which is a dialogue between Alex and an author figure named AB written for newspaper publication before the stage version came out as a book; essays articles and reviews and more. It's a work for true fans of ACO.<br /><br />I must admit I did not read much after the play but all in all, it was quite a ride. The book sure has the power to make you think about many things. There isn't much more I can say because it is a book that needs to be savoured, words don't do it justice. So...<br /><br />What's it going to be then, eh?<br /><br />For a full review with spoilers please check out my blog Ana's Lair., etc., etc; practically any bad thing you can think of is approached in this book.<br /><br />For all that and more I cannot mention because I am still baffled and it was quite a ride, the 5 stars are well deserved.

B00005RFAI|4|I've always liked Pink's music, but after listening to this album, I can honestly say that I AM A TRUE FAN! It seemed as if Pink were digging out my inner feelings that were once surpressed and re-surfacing them. Yes, at times...it got quite depresing, but it allowed me to begin assessing these issues one step at a time instead of bottling them all up. With this album, you can really tell Pink has gone through an emotional roller-coaster which just proves that shes just like all of us...
B00AFEXRME|5|Wonderful movie!  It's one I wanted to keep in my DVD library to watch again and again.  Makes you wonder if the drugs and booze are truly a part of the flight staff and their lives.  Part was well-played by Washington.  I didn't think the totally nude woman walking back and forth in front of the camera was necessary in the beginning.  Leave some things to our imagination please!
B005544TRQ|4|Clever, rapport between two main characters, interesting story lines. It's easy to watch while I'm working out. I look forward to more seasons
B00003CX8U|1|bad tape the second one..need replacement tape..love this and want to share with my grandaughter.

0062011847|1|Like many others, I'm a huge fan, having read practically everything Pratchett has written. The downward slope for me started with Unseen Academicals, which was so clunky and awkwardly written, that it took me a long time to read (normally, I can get through a good Discworld novel in a matter of hours).<br />Fine.<br />Snuff is unreadable. It is rambling, abruptly starting and ending scenes, characters are flat and unlikable and it is the first Terry Pratchett book I have been unable to finish reading. I started when it was first published and three months down the line and 120-odd torturous pages later I gave up.<br />Go, re-read his great old stuff, buy a copy of Guard, Guards for a friend, but leave this one alone.
B0076I622Y|5|Just fun to see these characters two bring each other up throughout the movie.  A charming cad you can't get enough of and an awkward young boy, both going though growing pains.  The rest of the cast is wonderful as well, makes me want to read the book!  Highly recommended!
B00I8Q77Y0|4|It's the closest you're going to get to floppy bird for the kindle fire. It's about the same, but the bird falls faster (and also poops occasionally).
B00HGJ18C2|3|It is a good game .
B000BW7QWW|5|I recommend for anyone who likes science fiction & likes to see the underdogs fight the good fight.  The mix of mandarin & &#34;updated&#34; english words is very interesting to those with geeky tendancies.
B004T4LUPW|3|It works, but it's not as easy to read as the Kindle's regular calendar. I was hoping it would sync to that calendar. Also, it lags some when turning to the next month or trying to select a specific date. It seems like the HD should just sync my Google Calendar properly, with all the separate calendars, instead of having to pay $6 for an app.
B002AT4KA0|5|awesome
B00005UKE0|5|I was relunctant to purchase 'All things must pass' at first. None of the Beatles solo efforts ever impressed me that much. They all seemed to lack the inspiration, and energy that the Beatles as a band always seemed to put out.<BR>'All things must pass' though is different. Harrison gets his first chance to shine without the Lennon-McCartney shadow hanging over him, and proves what a great songwriter he truly was.<BR>The album is basically low toned, with few rockers, or loud songs on it, instead you get a chance to see the real George Harrison, sensitive, gental and quiet.<BR>The entire album is great, but my personal favorites include &quot;Isn't it a pity&quot;, &quot;I'd have you anytime&quot; and the title track.<BR>It is a pity the Harrison has recently passed on, my he rest in peace.<BR>George Harrison 1943-2001
B00FMF3R0I|5|Nice collection of BBC recordings compiled together as a 4-disc boxed set (Vols. 1 and 2 together)  ... Highly recommended!
0385344325|3|For Reacher fans, this flashback novel on Reacher's last days in the Army is historically interesting because it fills gaps in his resume. It provides a different reason for why he left the Army than given in earlier novels. It also shows how Reacher's \\"no suitcase, will travel\\" ethos got started. Unfortunately, the novel is marred by excessive violence than exceeds the violence of any previous Reacher book and the aftermath is simply not credible. It's been a long series and Childs has done a good job in keeping the quality level up, but we may look at this novel as the beginning of a marked decline in the series. However, having said that, even a mediocre Reacher is still a good read. But you would not want to recommend this book to your friends for their first Reacher novel.
B000001FN1|5|This was one of the most well rounded, and most impressive releases of the 80's Heavy Metal era in my opinion. \\"Triumph And Agony\\" is also the best release Warlock has ever put their name on....    Lead vocalist, and founding member Doro Peche is not only a total fox, she's got one hell of a voice as well. A pure Metal voice that is infectious, and beautiful at the same time. You'll fall in love with her if you're not careful. In 1987, I know I was....    \\"Triumph And Agony\\" was a graet purchace in 1987, and even today this release has stood the test of time as one of the best in Heavy Metal. Warlock totally rips on this release, and the songs are all very powerful and heartfelt. They had a unique sound, one that has not been duplictaed since IMO. I love this release, and from start to finish, it's a great ride. You wont know what hit you at first, and soon you'll understand why \\"Triumph And Agony' is so highly respected by Metal fans world wide.....    Do yourself a favor. Even if you've never heard Warlock, or anything Doro has done as solo artist, buy this immediately. It's a classic Metal masterpiece, and your collection wont be complete without it....    Highly Recommended. Five Stars.
B0042LJTQO|5|Although this is a budget edition, the musicianship and recordings are of the highest quality, and Brendel, as usual, shines.
B00005TT77|5|This is a great soundtrack, it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this soundtrck are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
B00F1BFRA6|5|just what I wanted . . .had to wait for the price to be in MY ballpark.
0440219078|4|Place yourself in a world where there is little or no emotion, an ordered community, ignorance of real life and where the word love is meaningless and you are in Jonas's world. This story makes you question whether or not you really want to live in that so-called perfect world. It also shows the horror of that perfect world. And when Jonas does begin to love he sets in motion events that can't be erased and are possibly devastating to the community. <br />The second time that you read the novel, The Giver, by Lois Lowry the story and characters are even more real than they previously were and the story has so much more depth than before. This novel is not only a good read for younger kids, but also for teenagers and adults because there are things in the novel that everyone can relate to. <br /> <br />~TA, Pembroke Academy <br />
B00N6PD3GE|4|Very interesting book. Contains many facts that were little known. Sometimes the author goes into too much detail, which adds nothing to the story. Good read for history buffs.
0783222475|4|Truly awesome visual effects are the star here, but the story is totally mumbo-jumbo of just stuff tossed in to make up for time. Similar to the story in &quot;Twister&quot; but both are truly awesome to see if just for  the effects. I love disaster movies and this is one of them. I think I  could have created a stronger plot but what's done is done. I was amazed at  the realistic effects. They scared me and made me see the true horror of  caught in nature's burning fury...literally.
B001UV4XI8|5|For starters let me be clear! I am a hard core 'Potter' aficionado who knows everything about the saga like I know my own palm....BUT...I'm not the fan that says: \\"Oh they changed that!\\" and \\"They did that wrong!\\" for one and only reason: Books and films are different; they target a somewhat different audience and have different views. And more importantly sth that is good on page doesn't mean that it will look good on screen. Take comic-book heroes' funky costumes for example.  So entering the next-to-last 'Potter' film I will say that it is phenomenal! It has heart, character development, scenes to get teary or even cry about, special effects and -being the first part of the finale- sets up the pace for the last 'Potter' outing, perfectly.  I am one person that will say what the producers and writer did RIGHT with the changes they made and support WHY they made them. [spoiler ALERT]  A) They added the actual scene that Hermione took the memories of her from her parents.  In a teary prologue-for-the-finale scene that shows what the trio is up to, preparing for their journey of finding and destroying Voldemort's horcruxes (which are bits of Voldemort's soul and the key of his immortality), Hermione takes away all memories of her, from her parents to protect them. The score in this scene is excellent and a teary Hermione looks around the living room as she fades away from all the family photos. So emotional. And her leaving alone her house while crying before the logo is revealed. Wow! It is the end.  B) Death of Hedwig  It was a somewhat small dissapointment I had from Jo's excellent book that Hedwig that made such an impression as an owl and with the famous \\"Hedwig's theme\\" to have such a 'collateral damage' death. So I liked they made her die like a hero ttrying to save Harry from a deatheater and thus making it the reason why Voldemort realises who is the real Harry. Great, great scene!  C) Harry and Ginny's seperation   While I admire Harry's bravery and heroismas he will be forever my childhood hero I found lame and predictable that he broke up with Ginny at the end of 'Half-Blood Prince' book to protect her. I like more that they got seperated because of the circumstances now that the trio is hunted...  D) Dobby   Since they had not included Dobby in the previous films I found very logical his reappearence in Diagon Alley as he is now free to go wherever he wants.  E) Harry and Hermione dancing  In a newly added scene Harry and Hermione are dancing to 'O' Children' by Nick Cave. There was a lot of debait with this scene as some of the fans found that it had a romantic subtext. NO! It's one of the most beautifully written scenes ever. Harry and Hermione shared a friendship different that his and Ron's and now alone, he wanted to cheer her up. They are children that are going through things that children who are 17 years old shouldn't so the song is spot on. The scene is excellent.    The acting is stop-notch and especially in this film that the grown-up cast is not so much around the young cast is shining truly! Emma Watson is incredible and steals almost everyone's thunder! Oh and there is a certain animation scene that really is like it's gotten out of a dream! This is a magical film, I totally recomend it and I can't wait to enjoy 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2' in my TV screen!    P.S. I'm not the one to talk about BD quality but this BD looks flawless!
B0094BB4TW|2|Open a link to read something that interest s you and come back you will find that the app reloads, losing your place and humbling the items on your wall. Frustrating. Kindle will not let you open Facebook in the browser when you have the app either.

B00JRAYXIE|5|This game was very good. It kept me playing to the very end. Didn't want to put it down. I love games like this. Was glad it came out so I could have something to do while I am getting over my neck surgery. It helped keep my mind off the pain. Thanks to the developers for this game. Look forward to more games like this.<br /> Paula
B003ZSI7R2|5|Vintage Trouble's The Bomb Shelter Sessions may be the best album I have purchased in years. Energetic, fresh, and unbelievably talented, Vintage Trouble should be on everyone's playlist. I dare you to see them live and tell me otherwise.
B000BTJDGC|5|Nop. There's nothing much to say but... this movie rocks!
0307730697|5|This is one of the greatest books that I have ever read.  There's not much more to it than that.  If you like reading about SOF and stories of real life experiences in success, failure, and faith and belief in God you will find no greater book than this one.
B004ZGI1V0|4|A twist to see Liam Neeson in a thriller role, the primary reason I elected to watch.  The price was right as well.  It turned out to be an engaging movie.  Not to give too much away, Liam is does a great acting job in a plot that hinges on a plot twist that is actually confusing more than thrilling, but Diane Kruger supports in outstanding fashion and gradually the whole makes sense.  Not an Oscar winner, nor will you be on the edge of your seat, but I got interested enough to want to follow along all the way to the end.
B00003CXBK|5|Anime with a complete and complex beautiful story, no annoying long humor sequences, no tons of reverb, I could go on and on.<br />This movie should set an example for all the cookie cutter, lone rogue vs. the bad guys anime movies out there!
B002QE3CTY|5|At first, I must admit this book was a bit slow at first, but it did really catch my attention once the storyline was rolling. It's an alternate reality type book, filled tons of laughs, soft momemts and an unpredictable storyline. I was never one to go for these type of books, but this one in particlar owes me a lot (and i mean a lot) of sleep. But above all, this book does something other titles fail to do. Create questions about human nature. Humans will thrive and create society knowin there may not be a way to freedom. Congrats James Dashner, and I can't wait for th scorch trials! :)
B006SAR0OK|5|If you approach these movies as a Tarantino tour of imagery, they are really quite well done. (Although, I must admit, I am not familiar with many of the genres.)<br />On the other hand, if the monolog on the &#34;black Mamba&#34; was in part one, you'd be hung up on 'what were they thinking' (&#34;only in the case of the black mamba is death certain&#34;)<br />I really liked the ending.  The Bill survey of comic super heroes is cool, if too short.  Just what is Superman saying about us with his Clark Kent &#34;costume&#34;?

B0046B8GEQ|5|This is a great little family film. Fun and interesting characters and not too preachy about parenthood. Great to have in the movie collection
0920668372|5|I had this book for my daughter when she was a baby, so was pleased as punch to find it on amazon at a great unbeatable price to replace the lost one from her baby days. got lost in the mail first time around, but the seller immediately sent a new one after a reasonable wait for the lost one to arrive. This is quality and great customer service.
