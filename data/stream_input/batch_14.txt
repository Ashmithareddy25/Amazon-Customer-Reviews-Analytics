B00000AFGM|5.0|Marilyn Manson has put more of himself into this album than anything he has ever done before. He's no longer afraid to show you what's in his heart, and he does in this album.  Just the lyrics alone are amazing, and  the music along with those lyrics are enough to kill.  He's won me over,  Marilyn Manson, I'm yours...
B000002UA2|5.0|Why this cd of Floyd's is not as recognized as say, Animals or The Wall or even Dark Side is beyond me.  Gilmour displays some of his finest guitar work, and Waters' and Gilmour's vocals are amazing and relaxing.It is a  must-have for every Floyd fan out there.
0783113943|1.0|Contemporary Hollywood loves movies about poor misunderstood actresses and models who resort to drugs/sex/drugs because their lives are so difficult in the fast lane.  Someone once said write what you know so Hollywood gives  us are these types of stories (at least this one doesn't have a hooker as  the lead character!).  It is convincingly played by the actors but one gets  the idea the parts are not really much of a stretch for them.  Additional  nude lesbian scenes were added to the video version which pretty much says  it all.
0394800389|5.0|Good for ALL AGES (my son is a little toddler who LOVES the rhyming and rhythm of Seuss's work).  This one is a killer, although, it's not nearly as bumbly and tumbly if you *sing* it.  Kind of a Mel Tillis....thing.   Maybe after the 100th reading I'll be brave enough to drop the sing-song  melody and attempt to just read it!
0780622553|5.0|This movie was one of the best I've seen in over a year!  The imagery and production were superb!  Certainly in the ranks of Blade Runner or Coppola's Dracula for being visually stunning.  I was surprised at the  defensive nature of the special features section, as I don't see anything  for which the makers of this film to be apologetic or even defend.  This  film will stand on its own as have Metorpolis, Blade Runner and other  movies that took their audiences further than may have been comfortable for some.  I encourage you to listen to part of the commentary by Roger Ebert - he clearly liked this movie as well, and offers unique insight in his commentary.
B000000OQ5|5.0|When I bought this tape (shows how old I am) I was getting ready to drive from Virginia Beach, VA to College Park, MD (3.5 - 4 hour drive).  I put the tape in my player and did not take it out until I returned to Virginia  Beach 3 days later!  This album ROCKS period.  The mix of music is superb.   Tesla can do it all; soft, heavy, blues and ballads.  If there was ever one  Rock Album that was a MUST HAVE, this is IT!
6302256615|1.0|this movie dosen't show the true meaning of the sport of surfing..it was 1 of the worst surf want to be movies ever..
6304924216|5.0|After getting past the somewhat gruesome face slicing scene, the movie develops into an action packed, somewhat comedic romp in the fields of death and destruction.  It is very interesting to see how the main  charecters react when switched into another persons life style.  And any  movie where you get to see both Travolta and Cage be both hero and villian  gets my vote.  It is also fantasticlly directed by John Woo, no less.
B00000DBXO|4.0|While it lacks a breakout hit like &quot;The Distance,&quot; prolonging the magic is, from begining to end, far more listenable than its predicessor.  Hot spots include &quot;Satan is my Motor&quot; and &quot;You  Turn the Screws.&quot;  The new lineup seems to gel together very well,  though they do not have the punch felt on the first two albums, they make  up for it with a new smoothness.
B00000AFFI|5.0|PJ's always been one of my favorites, but she's really outdone herself this time. I can't get this disc out of my player. The more I listen the more I find to like. Much more like her older &quot;Rid Of Me&quot; than  her last more commercial &quot;To Bring You My Love.&quot;
B000002J0G|5.0|After the widespread popularity of &quot;The Ritual&quot;, I expected Testament to maybe, relax their pace and write music similair to the radio friendly song &quot;Return to Serenity&quot;. With the release of 'Low',  Testament has silenced the &quot;Metallica-copy-cat&quot; critics, shoved  some power metal up their asses, and given their fans what they've been  after...a follow up to &quot;The Ritual&quot; that blows it out of the  water. From the blisteringly fast guitar riffs, to the crispness of the  percussion, this album masters the art of speed metal through Testament's  own musical complexity, and takes it into the 90's with a dash of indusrial  death metal. I recommend 'Low' to all speed metal purists...especially  anyone who can appreciate thrash metal UNDER CONTROL; with machine gun  guitar riffs that steer the music and are complemented by vocals and an  intricate bass line that doesn't drown out the rest of the song. This album  is a keeper..I gaurantee it !!!
0385484518|5.0|You cannot read this book without taking something away with you that can change how you look at life and death in a very profound way.  Tuesdays with Morrie is a great lesson in the living of life a in spite of the  reality of death.  I would recommend this book to everyone.
B0000025DV|5.0|The Great Rock'n'Roll Swingle!<br />For those who thought you knew everything about your beloved ELO, I put these two questions to you. Who are The Swingle Singers? And what is the connection with ELO?<br />I must admit to not  knowing the answer to this until I recently read through the insert to the  Japanese released Out Of The Blue (GXG 25/26), and having the intrigue to  find the answer. So the best place to start is always at the beginning, and  this case is no exception.<br />Back in 1977 when Out Of The Blue was released  in Japan, it came with the usual obi, poster &amp; spaceship model, but  also with a Japanese lyric insert. Contained on this insert along with a  Japanese translation was a hand written album summary by Mr. Bevan. So from  this moment on I'll let Bev take over....<br />To all our fans in  Japan,<br />First of all I would like to say I hope you enjoy this album very  much. It is our 8th LP, and the first time we have ever recorded a  double-album. As with &quot;Face The Music&quot; and &quot;A New World  Record&quot; it was recorded at Musicland Studios in Munich, West Germany.  The 17 tracks contained here took about 2 weeks to learn (in Switzerland)  and approximately 14 weeks to record. Here now is a short run-down on each  track and my personal thoughts on each:-<br />Side One.<br />1. Turn To Stone -  <br />The first single to be taken from the album. Very up-tempo number and a  great rhythm feel. Listen out for the 'operatic' type vocal part in the  middle-eight.<br />2. It's Over -<br />Much emphasis on vocals with Jeff and  Kelly singing all the harmonies.<br />3. Sweet Talkin' Woman - <br />Originally  called &quot;Dead End Street&quot; but we changed it when Jeff re-wrote the  lyrics.<br />4. Across The Border - <br />Listen out for the train noises first  also some Spanish style trumpets. Big finish with much phasing on the  drums.<br />Side Two.<br />1. Night In The City -<br />A lot of traffic noise which  people who live in Tokyo will be familiar with! Heavy rock song that we  look forward to performing on stage.<br />2. Starlight -<br />Nice 'feel' to this  song and meant to have a 'rhythm and blues' feeling to it.<br />3. Jungle  -<br />Great fun recording this song with our imitations of bird calls,  elephants, Tarzan and even a tap dance sequence performed by Jeff, Kelly  and myself.<br />4. Believe Me Now -<br />Very short track featuring the vocoder,  an electronic device that can make almost anything sound as if it is  talking.<br />5. Steppin' Out -<br />A very nice, rather sad song about having to  move on elsewhere (as we do all the time!)<br />Side Three.<br />This whole side  of the album is a concept based upon the weather elements, especially rain  and how weather conditions can affect your personality. The whole side is  entitled &quot;Concerto For A Rainy Day&quot;<br />1. Standing In The Rain  -<br />Quite complex timing in this in some parts and probably the hardest  song for us to learn.<br />2. Big Wheels -<br />At the moment anyway, my  favourite song on the LP. Very sad and basically saying that no matter what  happens the whole world keeps turning and life goes on.<br />3. Summer And  Lightning -<br />Great sounds of thunder and lightning actually recorded  outside the studio in Munich where it rained a great deal during the time  we were there.<br />4. Mr. Blue Sky -<br />A Happy song - we all feel happier  when the sun shines after a storm. The choir are very good at the end of  this track singing in the style of the 'Swingle Singers'.<br />Side Four.<br />1.  Sweet Is The Night -<br />Very nice singing again from Jeff and Kelly. They  sing very well together and have similar voices (throughout the album Jeff  sings the majority of songs and Kelly joins him on harmony parts  throughout. I am the only other group member to sing on the LP, adding bass  and baritone parts when required).<br />2. The Whale -<br />The only instrumental  track on the album written about the Whale - a most beautiful and most  intelligent creature that is often needlessly slaughtered.<br />3. Birmingham  Blues -<br />Most of us come from Birmingham, England and this rock and roll  song simply tells of how we miss being there.<br />4. Wild West Hero -<br />A  dreamers song. It tells of a man who wishes he had a more exciting life -  he wishes he were a &quot;Wild West Hero&quot;.<br />So there you have my  short summary of the tracks from &quot;Out Of The Blue&quot;. We are very  proud of the album, I believe Jeff has written some of his finest songs  here and his production is the best of all our albums.<br />We look forward to  seeing you when we tour Japan. I hope you all enjoy listening to &quot;Out  Of The Blue&quot; as much as we enjoyed making it.<br />Thank  you.<br />Cheerio!<br />Bev Bevan<br />Thanks Bev, now it's back to me. So one  question has been answered, Mr. Blue Sky was sung in the style of the  Swingle Singers. But who are the Swingle Singers? To answer this, it's over  to Andrea Figallo, the CASA (Contemporary A Cappella Society Of America)  Ambassador to Italy.<br />Who are they? <br />&quot;If it's music we'll sing  it!&quot;. This seems an extravagant claim unless you've heard The Swingle  Singers in concert. These eight talented young vocalists move effortlessly  from organ fugues to orchestral overtures, from big band favourites to  piano pieces - all sung with out accompaniement - as well as performing  original arrangements of pop classics and folk tunes.<br />The Swingle Singers  continue a tradition of outstanding musical achievement that began 30 years  ago in Paris. In 1963 Ward Swingle formed The Swingle Singers with a  repertoire of &quot;swung&quot; baroque music. When the Paris-based group  disbanded in the early 70's Ward Swingle moved to London and reformed the  group, this time from classically trained English singers. This enabled him  to broaden the repertoire to include romantic composers, jazz greats and  pop classics. In 1984 Ward Swingle retired from the group and returned to  his native America to begin a series of lectures and seminars. New members  were recruited and the group continued to grow from strength to strength,  always looking for new and challenging music to sing.<br />Today The Swingle  Singers' show has a variety that one would expect to find from a group  which has been constantly extending the frontiers of a cappella music for  all of its 30 years. Their 2-hour a cappella show has something for  everyone - the dazzling presentation of a kaleidoscope of musical genres  astounds audiences and fellow musicians alike. This, coupled with their  irrepressible humour, ensures an evening of pure entertainment.<br />Their  repertoire with orchestra, which includes Ravel's &quot;L'Enfant et les  Sortilèges&quot;, Brahms' &quot;Liebeslieder&quot; Waltzes, a Beatles  evening and a Porgy and Bess Medley, has brought invitations to perform  with many of the world's most famous orchestras, including the London  Symphony, The Royal Philharmonic, and The Boston Pops Orchestras. In the  field of contemporary music, The Swingles regularly perform Luciano Berio's  Sinfonia - written for The Swingle Singers and the New York Philharmonic  Orchestra. Their most recent performances of the work have been with the  Chicago Symphony Orchestra, under the direction of Pierre Boulez, both in  Chicago and in Tokyo, as part of Japan's contribution to Boulez's 70th  birthday celebrations.<br />In 1990 the group premièred &quot;Blimunda&quot;,  a new opera by Azio Corghi, with La Scala Opera Company, Milan, winning  critical acclaim throughout Europe. They have since performed  &quot;Blimunda&quot; in Lisbon and Turin, and in February 1995 in Rome they  gave the world première of &quot;I Sogni di Blimunda&quot;, Corghi's a  cappella suite inspired by the music from the opera. In july 1992 as part  of the Ravenna festival they premièred a new show entitled &quot;Adieu a  l'Italie&quot; - atribute for Rossini's bicentenary, which not only saw  them singing, but dancing around the theatre. Such was the success of the  show that they have been invited to perform it all over Europe.<br />Being  equally at home in jazz clubs, opera houses, and concert halls the world  over, it is easy to see why The Swingle Singers were awarded the All Music  Award (established by Johnny Dankworth and Cleo Laine) - an award that  recognises the contribution made by artists whose work trascends  traditionally accepted musical boundaries.<br />With their diverse repertoire,  musical excellence and highly entertaining performances, these young men  and women continue to delight and enthrall audiences across the  globe.<br />Andrea<br />So there you have it, or do you? It wasn't until I'd  listened to the  CD &quot;Anyone for Mozart, Bach, Handel, Vivaldi?&quot;  by The Swingle  Singers, that all this made any sense. It's still difficult  to  explain, and probably the best way to fully understand it is to  listen  to The Swingles, and be amazed at the style that influenced  one of ELO's  most popular songs, which also captured the hearts of  many around the  world, myself included.<br />May the intrigue be with  you!<br />compiled/researched by &quot;The Greenwood' original material &amp;  article inspiration by Bev Bevan additional material by Andrea Figallo  photography by Ted Blight

0385484518|1.0|The professor sounds like a great guy but Albom took his wisdom and distilled it into a Hallmark card of platitudes. But the book is worth reading to learn the magic formula that creates a best-seller. I wish I  wrote this book. For the $$$$
B000001Y2U|5.0|I have to admit it took a while to get through the  noise to appreciated what manson had to say in this cd.  I appreciated the sincerity of the lyrics and all that goes with it.  The 'noise' grows on you like an  overnight beard; after a few weeks of playing this cd in my car system, i  really came to see who this man really is.  Nothing more than an ordinary  person with an ordinary background with an ordinary goal in life(to be  successful).  Reading the book after listening to the cd allowed me to  admire the man for what he is; seeing his normalcy(that noone else seems to  see(the forest through the trees))and how he uses his past experiences as a  youngster to create music.  I know this man has a lack of musical talent  and so do his bandmates, but what he has that not too many other bands have  is the ability to give to the listener deep personal feelings that mean so  much(especially if you are around the same age as he is).  I sum this one  up saying, &quot;what a better way to live a life, than to express your  feelings(angst, anger, love, hatred, etc) through music that others can  possibly appreciate.  And of course get rich at the same time.
0684874350|5.0|Although I have never been much for biographies at all, this was an excellent book.  I had a difficult time putting it down.  It's not action packed or full of excitement, yet there's something about the way it's  written that makes it hard to stop reading.  It follows the life of an  Irish family and thier bouts with daily problems.  It is an interesting  view of the life of Frank McCourt from childhood into adulthood.   I  especialy enjoyed the informal way in whch it was written, using a  child-like manner of speach without quotation marks. This seemed to  illustrate  the innocence of the characters themselves. Overall, I give  this book two thumbs up and five stars, for uniqueness and entertainment  value.
B000002O4S|5.0|I loved this soundtrack ever since I first saw the movie way back in 1985 (time sure flies!).  The cut by Marty McFly &amp; the Starlighters of &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; has got to be the very best version of that old  favorite I've ever heard!
B00000DF6O|5.0|B.B. King has always follwed his roots,  at times he may wander a little(Not on this cd) to find  what is good.  He went strictly &quot;back to basics&quot;And we get to hear what he has always known &quot;The  Blues&quot;.Thank you Mr. King
3931141802|5.0|this is the only book to buy if you are interested in photography.  every image is true. if you ever have a chance to view the actual prints, don't miss them. i have learned more about photography from looking at this book  than any other source.  it is a masterpiece.
0789420708|5.0|Our church youth just finished their play of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; and here we have a book of all the details.  Wow, looking it over in a bookstore locally, I don't even have to read it in order to know this is a  fantastic book with terrifically detailed iiustrations, just the kind of  thing our late elementary and young middle schoolers want.  I am definitely  going to order this for our church library.
0553275976|5.0|A friend of mine gave me the book to read over the Christmas break. What a treat. Some parts caused me to laugh out loud. I found the ending to be appropriate because it could very well be the true ending for a ridiculous  case such as the one McCoy was in. When you're dealing with the politics of  situations, this is sometimes the way things unfortunately end. I did like  Judge Kovitsky, he was one of the characters who actually was decent.
0790736926|5.0|A memorable quote when the Duke is asked at various times: I thought that you were Dead? The Duke always responds:  &quot;That'll be the day&quot;
0790729628|5.0|I prefer the director's cut. Actually the version Ridley Scott prefers is the one that was shown in Denver before the films release - it had some narration by Harrison Ford, the elevator closing ending, and the soundtrack  wasn't completed. The director's cut that's available falls somewhere  between that sneak peek and the June 82 final release. I like the film  without the the voiceover; you can hear the background sounds and music  now!
0790734850|5.0|Yes, &quot;Titanic&quot; may have been the best spectacle in movie theaters last year, but this was the best movie--chock full of consistently superior writing and acting and replete with a story that treats its  viewers as thinking adults rather than mindless entertainment zombies.  Guy  Peirce and Russell Crowe are outstanding as L.A. cops with diametrically  oppossed ideas of what constitutes &quot;justice&quot; (or so it seems).   You haven't seen good cop/bad cop played like this EVER!  Plus, it's  mind-blowing to hear them both expound in their native Aussie accents  during the documentary footage included on the DVD.   Kevin Spacey and  James Cromwell are also marvelous.  I wasn't all that keen on Kim Basinger,  though, who isn't asked to do much except be pretty.  Everyone else is  certainly acting in Oscar-calibre range.  Despite the convuluted plot,  Curtis Hanson directs in a style that's easy to trust and by the time he  brings us to the home stretch, I was sitting on the edge of my seat.  There's never been a movie this smart with this high a body count.  Dark,  beautiful, brutal and brilliant.
6304346107|5.0|The Kate Beckinsale Emma is far more a feisty and true to the novel characterization.  Gwyneth Paltrow is so wan and ghostly- she doesn't have the true spirit of the character as written by Austen.   As with all movie  adaptations of these books something is lost once it gets to the screen but  both are worth seeing.  It's interesting to see the two different  interpretations of the story.
B00000ADG2|5.0|Everyone enjoys this CD in my family including my Grandma!!! All it songs are cool. You realy should get it! Sonetimes you will buy a CD just because I thas one or two big hits and then when you listen to the rest of the CD  it's really crappy but with this CD all the songs are really good and it  also has a couple &quot;hidden&quot; tracks!!!! Get the cd!!!!                    YEAH!
0811821846|5.0|I was surfing for a gift for a friend who happens to be a big Star Wars freak, and found this book.  When I received it in the mail, I was laughing for hours!!  I have since ordered one for myself as well.  The writing is  hysterical, and the recipes are easy and fun.  Great job!!
630463949X|5.0|great picture and sound quality. Plus I enjoy looking at Stevie Nick
1883217040|5.0|This book is just outstanding in the way is speaks to the students. You have the feeling you are learning from a friend, instead from a teacher who doesn't care that you learn something. It starts with basic theory, and  goes on to the more advanced stuff like reharmonizing jazz standards and  playing outside etc. This book has it all, so if you're an aspiring jazz  student you should get this book, it is essential in any jazz fan's book  collection. Great stuff!
0060273224|5.0|This book is an excellent example of classic fantasy. It has its twists and turns, however. You never know what will happen next until you read it.
B00000DGUG|2.0|&quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; is possibly my favorite CD of the 1990's so I had high expectations for this one, but it was a real let down. Almost every song on &quot;Pill&quot; jumped off the radio or CD player and  demanded your attention, I can barely remember a thing about the new CD  after 3 listens.  I hate the intros to half the songs.  Alanis does not  have a &quot;beautiful&quot; voice, and she needs tough arrangements around  her songs to bring out its qualities.  I am really disappointed in this  one.  I wanted to love it.
0374172897|5.0|Virginia Woolf had the courage to write about life as it feels to the living.  Until I read The Hours, I thought she was the only one who could do this.
B0000025HU|5.0|Punk finally gets listenable.  What a great CD.  The best album of the punk era.  One of the 10 greatest ever made.  Punk's &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; so to speak.
B000009PNY|3.0|Yes, the material in the disc are passable.  But Depeche Mode doen't need the accolade afforded to dis-banded bands (no pun intended). But a tribute is a tribute is a tribute. It only shows that DM has put out so much good  music that great as well as up and coming groups are willing to do a cover.  Imagine THE CURE doing a D MODE song?  The project was all worth it though.  I bought the CD to complete my Depeche Mode collection. If you're an  all-out DM (like me since 1984), get the CD - but do not expect too much.
B000002BE9|4.0|This CD gets better with every listen.  I can't believe a woman so young can write such strong material.  Hopefully she won't hit the sophomore slump that befell Jewel and Alanis.
0684833395|5.0|Heller takes a unique look at war and showcases different personalities and perspectives.  This story spurs many philosophical and social discussions.  With this novel, you can dissect meaning or you can enjoy the  story for face value.  As usually is the case, don't expect the movie to  compare with the book.
B000002OXU|5.0|Every truly great band at one time hits the absolute height of perfection.  The Beatles did it with &quot;Abbey Road,&quot; the Stones did it with &quot;Sticky Fingers,&quot; and the Who did it with &quot;Who's Next.&quot;   If you want to know all you need to know about rock music then buy and  wear out those 3 CD's.   This album was recorded when the Who was in some  sort of spiritual zone.  I recently listened to this in my car and my wife  perked up from dozing off and we both air guitared, sang, drummed and  screamed our way home.  It's a perfect album.  People throw around 5 stars  like they're candy on this site, but this is what the 5th star was invented  for.   The album is bookended with two songs that are contenders for  greatest songs of all time.  &quot;Baba O'Reilly (Teenage Wasteland for  those who have only caught it on the radio)&quot; and &quot;Won't Get  Fooled Again.&quot;  In between these unbelievable tunes you get the  ferocious &quot;Bargain&quot; and the soaring &quot;Love Ain't for  Keeping.&quot;     &quot;My Wife&quot; is a tour de force that only the Who  could have done.  &quot;This Song is Over&quot; is a lovely tune that lets  you catch your breath before the final run-up to &quot;Fooled.&quot;   &quot;Gettin' in Tune&quot; makes you feel as if you're in Pete's brain.   &quot;Goin' Mobile&quot; is another song that only the Who could have  pulled off and &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot; is enough to bring tears to  your eyes, but the Band lets you get rid of those tears with Rock and Roll.
6303212263|4.0|Great movie and terrific introduction to the big screen for the Man of Steel. One of the great scenes in movie history is the rescue of Lois Lane, dangling from a helicopter. Way to go, Superman! The film has great  effects, fantastic music, and a good plot. The characterizations and  dialogue are SUPERb. The only annoying aspect of the movie is the prolonged  comedic sequences re: Lex Luthor and his henchpeople. This prevents it from  getting 5 stars. Otherwise, the movie is a classic, and the selection of  Chris Reeve as the Man of Steel is perfect.
B000005ITX|5.0|I can't find anyone else who has heard of this album.  I read about this one in the Rolling Stone Record Guide and listened to at the start of of a 5 hour trip.  I brought 20 or so CD's but instead listened to this eight  times.  It's magical.  Some of the lyrics are hard to swallow in callous  1998 (I believe in magic/why? because it is so quick) but that's beside the  point. &quot;The Red Telephone&quot; is one of my favorite songs of all  time.  This album is in my top ten list with the likes of the Beatles'  &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, the Stones' &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot;, &quot;Who's  Next&quot;, Dylan's &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot;, Zepplin's untitled,  Hendrix's &quot;Are You Experienced&quot;, Clash's &quot;London  Calling&quot; and the Smashing Pumpkins' &quot;Melancholy and the Infinite  Sadness.&quot;  It's THAT good.
6300268993|5.0|This is the best Superman movie to date, better than the first of the four Reeves movies, and far better than the third and fourth. Pitting The Man of Steel vs. villians from Krypton, not to mention Lex Luthor, plus a solid  love story with Lois Lane makes this picture great. The action doesn't let  up from the opening credits, with dynamite scenes from Superman I, though  the opening sequence in which Lois Lane, the Eiffel Tower and Paris are  rescued all in one shot. The excitement continues all the way to the final  battle with the three evil Superpeople. The comedic elements which slightly  marred Superman I are minimized here. And although one could get nitpicky  about certain aspects of the film, it is by far a super-classic for all  time, and is highly recommended.
B0000025RI|5.0|I am not a fan of dance music in general, but this is too infectious to pass up.  Every song is a masterpeice.  Unfortuneately, Michael never came close to something this good again, and mostly become a cultural joke who  sells albums to people praying for another &quot;Thriller.&quot;
6303407161|5.0|I can't watch this enough!  Fiennes and Turturro are fantastic
B000002OZY|3.0|As with so many double albums, this good be edited down to an incredible single album. &quot;Christmas&quot;, &quot;The Acid Queen&quot;, &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;, &quot;Tommy, Can You Hear Me?&quot;,  &quot;Sally Simpson&quot;, &quot;We're not Going to Take It&quot;,  &quot;I'm Free&quot;, and &quot;Welcome&quot; rank with the best songs the  Who ever did, but some of the other stuff is just crap and filler trying to  fill in the blanks on the story.   The story is really quite stupid (read a  novel if you want a story).  This is far superior to the Soundtrack as the  Who do a better job with these songs than the guests in the movie.   If  you're a novice to the Who, then start with &quot;Who's Next&quot; and  &quot;Meaty, Beaty, Big and Bouncy&quot; and &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;  before you try this one.     However, this is worth owning, just for  &quot;I'm Free.&quot;  Just use the program button on your CD player  liberally.
6304211740|3.0|This is a fairly credible film adaptation of the novel, but if you want the meat-and-potatoes version, buy the Dalton/Clarke movie instead.  If your taste runs more to weak tepid tea and stale bread, buy the  Hinds/Morton version.  I'd say this version falls somewhere in between.
B000002L5I|5.0|I'm was extremely impressed when I bought this album!  Being a SRV fan I feel I can say this, it seems to me SRV gave Kenny personal guitar lessons.  I'm 21 years old and it is refreshing to know the blues are still alive!   This is a great album to check out if you are tired of talentless hardrock  &amp; hip hop &quot;music&quot;!
0679781307|2.0|This book, written by a morally confused author, reads like an assignment for a university course studying both turn of the century German intellectual history with contemporary German Holocaust hand-wringing. It's  basic premises are unbelievable in the abstract and in the execution. The  chief sin of this book is its desire to make Michael Berg's moral dilemmas  serious ones. In fact, his relationship with Hanna is less interesting than  his inability to confront his own emotions. The most sensible discussion  about the Holocaust comes from the mouth of a man driving Berg, and is  presented as intolerable. The man blames the holocaust on the ability of  humans to become indifferent to the suffering of other humans. This is more  compelling than the idea that an inability to read coaxed Hanna into the  SS. (As if reading confers understanding and wisdom!) There are also far  too many useless references to now classic literature - Emilia Galotti,  Bachmann, etc... The reader interested in moral dilemmas would do better to  read Solzhenitsyn, or someone similar, where such dilemmas are at least  confronted honestly.
B000002UD0|4.0|Lushly produced and surprisingly coherent following the madness of the early &quot;Rock N'Roll&quot; sessions, this album finds Lennon somewhat lonely but still capable of cranking out popular pop like &quot;Whatever  Gets You Thru The Night.&quot; &quot;Scared&quot; and &quot;Nobody Loves  You&quot; are superb descriptions of hitting bottom. Unfortunately, there  aren't too many great melodies here, and &quot;Old Dirt Road&quot; sounds  like &quot;Imagine&quot;, while &quot;Steel and Glass&quot; sounds like  &quot;How Do You Sleep.&quot;
0790739909|4.0|I truly enjoyed this  movie and could identify with Meg's character.  She had a great job, a &quot;boyfriend&quot;, a dog, a house, and yet felt empty, restless, and uninspired by life.  The soundtrack and exceptional  cinematography add to the overall haunting and melancholic feel of the  movie.
B000002UCE|5.0|Lennon had a good idea of what he was doing and where he was going here. Such focus would soon begin to dissipate after this. But what we have here is some of his most beautiful and memorable solo material, well-played and  well-recorded.
0553278398|5.0|The prelude to the foundation series was excellent. A dynamic plot, and a great climax added to the story.
0792151712|1.0|Although it is easy to see how this brainless saga   could appeal to an equally brainless segment of the public, it is much harder to understand the honors that have been bestowed on this mediocre (albeit expensive)  production. The special effects were pretty good, and the details of  reconstruction of some of the inanimate objects was remarkable. The problem  was in the animate entities.<br />The main characters are anachronistic:  essentially 90's teenagers dressed in funny turn-of-the-century clothes. If  you are thrilled by the fact that Rose decided to follow her heart instead  of the social conventions of the time, you should consider having your  fiancee/wife/daughter run away with a gang member she only met two days  ago. It is easy to laugh at the social conventions of 90 years ago. A good  film should let us look critically at contemporary costumes. <br />Some of the  scenes are obviously emotionally charged (e.g. the two lovers looking from  the bow of the ship to the horizon) but one cannot escape the impression  that the number, intensity, and sequencing of these scenes come from some  &quot;How to make a movie&quot; manual that you can probably buy for $10.95  on this very site. All in all, I would say that the film reveals a decent  craftsmanship, but not a single shread of art (a situation not uncommon in  Hollywood).<br />The moral standings of the film are simplistic and  misleading. We don't really need to encourage teenagers to choose their  life partner based on a cute face, a couple of days on a boat, and an  uncomfortable one night stand. Blaming the survivors in the boats for not  rescuing the people in the water is equally simplistic. Having the boat  broken into pieces by a desperate mob would not have done much good to  anybody. Equally difficult for me to understand is the hard stand on the  character of Cal Hockley. I can see how, with a couple of minor corrections  to the script, this could become the heroic fiancee who fights to savehis  loved one from the advances of the ruthless social climber. Cal Hockley  could have been a much more complex and interesting character. But I guess  that one of the golden rules of Hollywood movies is that you need a  carboard-cut villain to oppose the equally cardboard-cut good guy.<br />I saw  this film in a theatre, and I don't feel any need to see it again at home.  I have better things to do with my time. But if all you like in a film is  to go see some special effects, and saying &quot;ooooo...&quot; when the  ship sink, and &quot;aaaaah....&quot; when the main characters kiss, then  this is the film for you.
078062369X|5.0|Blade is the best in the genre. Snipes does justice as the Daywalker. The special effects &amp; martial arts are awesome. Kris K.looks kool with his long hair and Snipes has never been sexier. When will Blade be back??
6305205620|5.0|I almost bought this on videotape.. thank God i didnt.. this is soooo amazing. The clarity is unsurpassed, great sound, and all the extra stuff is great... its so cool changing camera angles on for whom the bell  tolls... if you have DVD and love metallica.. this is something to own... i  watched it like 3 times the day i got it... its got cool things for your  computer too... i went to the reload tour concert.. this is just like the  real thing
0792153294|4.0|This movie is touching and exciting at the same time. It isn't your average save-the-world disaster movie. Its more than that, its the emotions and the struggles of individuals with the question 'how do you deal with  the end of the world?' What do you do when you have the opportunity to be  saved but those that you love cannot? This movie attempts to answer those  questions. At the same time, the action is there with realistic ideas that  suspend your disbelief. Of course, if you want a lot of action, silliness,  bad acting, a romance designed solely for the teenage market and cussing,  then go watch Armageddon. If you want to see a truly good movie, then watch  Deep Impact. It makes an impression on you that you will not soon forget.
0385484518|5.0|I found heart-warming and eye-opening advice from a man I may not have had the patience to listen to in real life.  He exemplifies the meaning to &quot;the circle of life&quot;.  And demonstrates to those of us always  looking for a quick and easy fix, that we need love and kindness, not time  and money.  Thank You!!
B000002IWJ|5.0|As a long time, dedicated fan of Phil Collins solo work, as well as with Genesis - Face Value is the definitive Phil Collins album.  The story behind the writing of this first solo album lends only further to the  appreciation of the stunning musical brilliance within.  Though the rest of  Phil's solo works are all great in their own respects, Face Value is the  very best of Phil's solo work - as following years see Phil Collins solo  career as well as with Genesis, usher him into worldwide popularity of  phenomenal proportions. The only other Phil album that is comperable in its  tone and emotional depth is Both Sides ('93) and is highly recommended as  well.
B00000G3PA|4.0|I feel that this movie is extremely exciting due to all the special effects.  The characters are funny and likeable.  Bruce Willis did a great job playing his character.  One of his best performances yet.<br />The  directors did a great job of playing with your emotions.  You were  consantly on the edge of your seat.  It made you feel proud to be an  American.  Yes, this movie is unbelievable...that's what this type of movie  is-fiction.<br />I don't recommend you like your small children watch this  movie due to the content.<br />I highly recommend this movie for your home  theater system.
B000002ADT|5.0|This album really caught me by surprise.  I never thought I was interested in jazz music until my brother gave this to me for my birthday.  I really enjoy the mellow character of the songs.  The songs are all unique, but  they also coincide nicely.  If you are ever going to give jazz a chance,  this is the place to start.  The development of each song is like magic.
0812550706|5.0|This is a really great science fiction quick read.  A very different story, with some nice twists.  Some parts were a little to military driven for myself, but if you like that type of thing, this will be one of your  faves.  A sci-fi must!
0316152196|4.0|I'm a long-time Connelly and Bosch fan and this was a worthy addition to the series.  I am very glad Connelly has wisely ditched Eleanor Wish from Harry's life---this type of character works better when they're alone and  lonely.  Look at John Sandford's Lucas Davenport and how he turned wimpy  when he fell in love with Weather.  It took several books before he was  back to normal.  Connelly also gives us his take on the Jonbenet Ramsey  case and another patented twist at the end. Although not as much character  development and detail as other Bosch novels, it's still readable and  definitely worth the money.  Let's hope the next book finds Harry tracking  another crime which lands Eleanor in the slammer again!
B000003S09|5.0|After listening to this on Vinyl for 25 years I decided to get the CD as the record is very much worn out.I do not know who mastered the cd but I feel the sound is terrible..especially on EPITAPH when Greg Lake's vocal  are barely audible.The cd sounded worse than my vinyl copy..I give the  Mmusic 5 Stars but the mastering job ZERO.
B00000DHRX|5.0|Who on earth could call GM mundane??  His versatility is what draws me to his music.  This man goes out onto a creative limb and makes it work every time.  If &quot;I cant make you love me&quot; doesnt put goosebumps on your  arms, nothing will.  This is the colllection I've been waiting for. Now if  he'd just go out on tour again....*hint hint*
630518299X|4.0|Awesome movie. It totally gripped me and made me look at everything differently. Are we being watched???? Lots of fun, humor, and yes even Carrey Drama. This role was a stretch for him and he did it great! PURCHASE  IT NOW!
B0000025F7|5.0|I can remember when my mother gave me this album as a gift for my birthday. That was the best gift anybody could ever give. I can remember listening to this album all day and all night, until i would fall asleep by  the record player. I still have the album of course, but i want it on CD  now. My favorites on the LP are don't stop till you get enough, working day  and night, get on the floor and dance with me. I must say this is his best  he has ever made. The entire album is incredible. For those of you who  don't have this LP take it from a ten year old fan, now much older and  still a fan.  &quot;GO GET IT&quot;
0553278223|5.0|Ray Bradbury's stories are like being shot. It hits you in the heart. This book is definetly one of the greatest works of all time. The prose is beautiful. It has a definite sense of wonder. It explores the depths of the  human soul.
B000002MZ6|5.0|I imagine the creation of the earth, as it is written in the Christian Bible.  It is music that we have used in our Modern Dance classes.  It relaxes the mind and at the same time opens it.  I can listen to it every  day and not tire of it.
084428596X|3.0|This book is very much like &quot;Norwegian: An Essential Grammar&quot; by se-Berit and Rolf Strandskogen.  Eventhough the title indicates that it addresses or teaches Norwegian verbs, it does very little with regard to  that -- in fact, it is not much different from the aforementioned book in  that sense too.  It does do a good job of teaching the grammar, though the  title is a misnomer.  I was expecting a book *filled* with hundreds of  verbs and their conjugations, but there are only about 12 (2x spaced) pages  of them.  Both the aforementioned and subject books are worth using to  learn Norwegian.  Mange takk til forfatterene!
0440211727|5.0|Of all the John Grisham's books this has to be right up there with The Firm.  All of the characters are actually developed unlike some OTHER books that I won't mention (coughcoughrainmakercoughcough).  I'm surprised The  Firm is what cought people's attention to John Grisham rather than this  book.  EVERYONE should read this book and decide not to just because the  movie wasn't that great.
0964385619|5.0|Mr. Kiyosaki explains the problems with our societies current paradyms of money, success and creating wealth.  How we are currently in the &quot;Rat Race&quot; and do not know how to break out of the race.  I found this book  to be a watershed moment in my life as an investor and creator of personal  wealth.  It is not a get rich quick book.  It is a book on changing the way  we look at our financial situations and why we need to change our way of  thinking to make quantum leaps in our personal wealth
6303908306|5.0|This is a truly great film with suprizes and twists that will leave you on the edge of your seat.  Filled with great acting especially from Kevin Spacy and Gabrial Byrne this movie is definitly one of the best crime  dramas I have ever seen.  I definitly recomend it.
0684874350|5.0|If you have a heart you will love this book!  You simply cannot read past the first few chapters without feeling some sort of intense reaction to the characters; and expect that feeling to change several times throughout the  novel!  I couldn't put it down!
630289915X|5.0|If you've seen this film I don't need to say anything.  If you haven't...you live in cave.  It's my all-time favorite move of any genre.  Yes, I've seen it a thousand times but I still watch it at least once exch  Xmas.  What's overlooked in all this is the marvelous direction of Frank  Capra.  Jimmy Stewart was born to play this role and thank goodness he did!   If the final scene doesn't bring a tear to your eye, well then, you need  to be in therapy.
0780622650|4.0|Very good special video effects. Could have been a little better on the sound side. Over all I would watch it again.
079070546X|5.0|A great film that is a modern classic.  It's hilarious, disgusting (Randy Quaid is fabulous) and yes even heartwarming (when Sparky watches old home movies while locked in the attic).  We watch it every year.
1556154844|5.0|As a new programmer I purchased this book on a friend's recommendation. I found I could not put it down. Steve McConnell as taken a complicated and obscure subject like coding and turned out an easy to read, easy to  understand bible for the industry. Bravo and I look forward to reading his  next book.
0684874350|2.0|I was really disappointed by this novel.  Although the descriptive writing was very explicit , the story itself revealed very little.  How often does the reader have to hear about the dirty jars and the coal?  I  felt  &quot;ripped off&quot; by this book.  After reading in such great detail  about this man's poor, rotten childhood, I would have liked to know how it  affected him later in life...what happened to this boy when he got to  America?
B000002UQJ|5.0|I'm just eighteen, and &quot;Off the Ground&quot; was my first Paul McCartney album. Before I was a Beatles fan (which I am now, of course), I was a seventh grader who heard &quot;Hope Of Deliverance&quot; on the radio  and HAD to have this album. I fell in love with it immediately, and my  Macca collection has continued to grow. It was through this album that I  discovered the wonderful world of the Beatles, and I still maintain that  Paul is the most brilliant of the four of them. The stuff on this CD is as  good as anything Paul has ever done.
6305265488|4.0|This film was a truly well done piece of art, evoking the fairytale essence and emotions that only Cinderella has the ability to render. In short, it basically rocked.  Although it was completely predictable and a  total cliche, the film still manages to touch the audience in a unique yet  heartfelt manner.  This movie is perfect for the hopeless romanic in all of  us!
B00000AFHM|4.0|A great disc.  With every musician out there attempting to fuse the history of pop music and every conceivable sample into one song, it's nice to hear a subtle, restrained, musical disc for a change.  Is it just me, or  does his voice sound a little like a chillin' nico?
0780624890|5.0|Blade was everything &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot; wasn't. A very &quot;hip&quot; movie. I have yet to see a &quot;vampire&quot; movie that entertained me as much as &quot;Blade&quot; did. The DVD transfer is first  rate! Totally cool extras make this one a keeper!!!
0800187873|5.0|I HATE MOB MOVIES!!!  Having gotten that off my chest, let me tell you that Donnie Brasco is a movie you buy to watch over and over.  The characterizations are that rich, with exceptional performances by Johnny  Depp &amp; Al Pacino.  This is a study of choices, friendship and when  doing the &quot;right thing&quot; gets very, very complicated.  Yes, it's  also the great &amp; good FBI chasing the big, bad mobsters on one level -  so get ready for some violence.   But forget about it..... this movie has  many layers and is worth the effort.  It was the best film I've seen in a  long time.
6304666799|5.0|You'll never think of Swan Lake again after seeing this incredible production. Matthew Bourne has brilliantly re-interpreted the fable into a moving, funny and ultimately heartbreaking experience. Adam Cooper is  enthralling as the swan and the rest of the cast is musically and  dramatically superb. But where is the DVD????
0062513982|5.0|A wonderful story, capturing the hopes and desires of would-be lovers.  Reminds us to take chances in life, whether it be to uproot and change locations, or to trust the heart, and follow a dream.  The characters  remind us of ourselves.  I was bought this book by a lover, now I by it for  friends and family
B00000DFRS|1.0|The only noteworthy song on this album is the duet with Mariah Carey. Whitney Houston usually does well. But this time, she missed the mark and missed it by a mile. She was singing songs that were not Whitney. She  didn't have that &quot;hungry&quot;, spirited sound like she once had. She  should try again, but this time, use her talent or maybe listen to her  previous cd's and see what is missing. She should leave people like Missy  Elloit out of her music. Missy is good for &quot;ghetto&quot; and  &quot;urban&quot; sounds, but she dosen't mix with a true diva. So for both  Arista and Whitney, back to the drawing board.....Please!!!
0792151712|5.0|A good story, hunky-stud hero &amp; the beautiful Kate Winslet help make this movie as good as its publicity...well, almost.
B000002MZ6|5.0|There are few CDs of this nature that can transport you to another world, another life, another time. And thats exactly what Mike Oldfield accomplish with his music. Is an entire story wrap up is a thin disc. A  more than proper tribute to Arthur C. Clarke
B0000029DD|5.0|Jeff has a way of taking one into a song.  Grace  is in my opinion is a groundbreaking musical work. His voice and guitar combined with tastful use of dynamics is more than pleasing to the ear, it's paled the other music in  my life. This disc is a must for anyone who is tired of the charade of most  other musicians.
0316152196|5.0|Connelly keeps developing Harry Bosch. Harry and his partners are believable, three-dimensional, characters who manage to grow with each book. The terrific characters, coupled with Connelly's mastery of the  police procedural make superb mysteries.<br />Somehow I knew Angels Flight  would be worth waiting for.<br />Oh, how I wish I could write like this.
B000002H2H|5.0|I will review all the Metallica CD's here.  I chose to do it on the &quot;RIDE THE LIGHTNING&quot; page because it is my favourite Metallica album.<br />KILL'EM ALL: better than people give it credit               for,  especially &quot;Seek and Destroy&quot;              <br />LIGHTNING: best  album! &quot;Fade to Black&quot;, &quot;For Whom            the Bell  Tolls&quot;, and the title track             are the best<br />MASTER: a close  second! title track, &quot;Disposable         Heroes&quot; and  &quot;Welcome Home&quot; are amazing<br />JUSTICE: very good!

If it                      was another band who did it,                    it would be  amazing.                     &quot;Unforgiven&quot; is one of the best                     songs in history.<br />LOAD: Absolute crap! &quot;King  Nothing&quot; is pretty good<br />RELOAD: Absolute crap!

6304163029|5.0|Only Stevie Ray could bring this many stars together, and what a concert it is.  Everyone is there to pay tribute to Stevie not for themselves.  Each does their song in their own style, not imitating SRV.  This video is  worth it, if for nothing else, to see Eric Clapton rip into Ain't Gonna  Give Up on Love and the SRV Shuffle at the end.  Totally spectacular, I am  proud to have it.
6305169187|5.0|The first time I saw this movie was with my girlfriend on our first date togther. By the end of the movie we both were in tears. We then waited until three months to the date of our first date to watch it again. Within  the first ten minutes of the movie I was in tears. This movie is just such  a roller coaster of emotions each time you watch it. This movie is worth  watching a hundred times or more.
B000002P72|5.0|When learning guitar, 20 odd years ago, a Happy Traum book suggested this was a very important album. It was SO right. I ended up in a band in undergrad later. At the lead guitarist's reception, he tried to give me a  copy, I could smugly say I'd had one for years. If you play, or want to  play, lead guitar, this is a desert island disk.
0670880728|5.0|I only got through &quot;June&quot; in Bridgets diary and had a great time so far. Just thinking about it makes me want to sneak into the restroom at my office and read some more. I couldnt help but peak at her  last entries to check if she stays with Daniel (I really want her to!!)
0792151712|5.0|I don't have a lot to say, but I think that this movie shows how the experience was for the actual passengers aboard the Titanic. The love story between Jack Dawson (Dicaprio) and Rose Dewitt Buchater (Winslet) also  contributes a lot to the story.
B000002OX7|5.0|This is one of those rare rock albums that represents the peak in a great band's career.  If I could only keep 5 CD's from my collection (not including any Led Zeppelin) this would be one of them.  My favorite song  from the album, &quot;Getting In Tune&quot;, represents Daltrey's voice at  it's best, and John Entwistle's bass playing puts it over the top!<br />If you  don't own this album, don't even bother debating whether to buy it...
6304211740|2.0|This Zeffirelli version of Jane Eyre is the worst one I've seen (and I've seen them all, especially if you've read and love the book)-- I had a hard time staying to the end of the film.  Hurt is totally unsuitable as  Rochester, and unbelievable with his stilted dialogue (not to mention  american accent); he seems uncomfortable in this role.  Charlotte  Gainsbourgh as Jane is more creditable, though the chemistry between the  two leads falls like cold suet.  This film may appeal to those who have not  read the book...however, for my money, the BBC production with Timothy  Dalton and Zelah Clarke is the best one of them all.
0440219078|5.0|I had to read this book for school. What I expected was a dull and boring book but, what I got is much different. I've never read a book like this before. When you start reading it the author slowlys starts to draw a  picture of what this place is like and made me wonder is this what could  happpen in the future? It isn't such a bad idea in someways. But, I not  saying I would want this to happen.   After reading this book is still  making me think. I think if your taking this much to read these reviews you  should read the book.
B000006ZH9|4.0|&quot;Against the Grain&quot; was, in 1975, a departure from the earlier stuff Rory Gallagher had done previously in that it was more refined, yet still had that raw blues/rock edge that made Rory one of the best  guitarist's of the 1970's and early 80's.The album has excellent lead and  slide guitar work all over the place, as well as some nice acoustic stuff  on &quot; Out on the Western Plain&quot;.Rory's career had three phases.  The first, was composed of extremely strong live performances, that somehow  didn't ever translate to the studio. The second, of which Against the Grain  started, was where Rory had mastered the art of taking his wild blues rock  playing, and translating that sound from live to studio work.The third and  final phase, in his decline, was during the late 80's and early 90's, where  he tended to become slower in lead guitar technique, and moved toward's  heavy metal type sounding, i.e. more volume was better...etc. This also was  concurrent with his problems with his health, etc.Still, one of the best  guitarists ever, and one of Ireland's finest. We fans miss him.
6300213668|5.0|I really love the songs in Grease since they are so energetic and exciting, especially Greased Lightning.  John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John are great actors.  This movie is terrific for both kids and  adults.  I'd recommend this movie to anyone who likes rock and roll!
0440224764|5.0|I began reading this book in a lounge at LAX, waiting to board a flight to Tokyo. I usually use the bathroom every two hours, but The Partner had me glued to my window seat for 11 hours. Yes, this was the fastest  transpacific flight ever. Thanks JG!
0790734060|4.0|Aside from the many factual inaccuracies, I enjoyed this film!  The opera scenes are breathtaking, and that casting was very well done.  Salieri was played out well, calm, cool, but always plotting, and Mozart and his  bufoonish laugh...It really brought out the point that genius can be held  in the most unlikely places.  Bravo!
B000001IQH|5.0|This album rules I'm listening to it right now. Matt Freeman is a genius at bass(ex.In Journey to the End of the East Bay).Tim and Lars kick at vocals and Brett is cool at drums.   My favorite songs are Ruby Soho,  Journey to the End of the East Bay, and Disorder and Disarray.
B00000DHR0|5.0|I ordered &quot;These are Special Times&quot; by Celine Dion from amazon.com and I can say that the CD is a very good one. Music composition as well as the voice the Celine is just amazing. The songs are very well  interpreted with the crystal clear voice of one of the best vocalists in  the world.
B00000DHR0|4.0|Having been a Celine Dion fan since &quot;Unison&quot;, I was thrilled when I heard she was releasing a Christmas CD. &quot;The Prayer&quot; and the balance of the traditional Christmas songs are the highlights, while  &quot;I'm Your Angel&quot; is basic radio friendly boredom (my least  favorite Celine track of all time &amp; hence only 4 stars). The more  contemporary tracks are a bit weak (hey, not every song can be &quot;White  Christmas&quot;), but on the whole a beautiful package. As a side note, all  of you who rated the disc 1 star (and probably didn't even listen to it), I  hope Santa brings you a lump of coal every Christmas for the rest of your  lives!
0399143904|1.0|This book should not be read unless you have read ALL of the others first(not includining OP CENTER). Failure to take this advise will cause you to miss out on some truly fantastic writing. This book should only be  used for kindling to start a fire, it is truly horrible! The story line  begins slow, as with most Tom Clancy. The characters are well known to  those who have read the other books, so interest is kept in this regard.   The story never gains momentum to keep the reader interested, it is truly  an effort to finish. In my humble opinion the climax of the story is about  2/3 of the way into the book. The ending is totally unexciting. Where is  Jack Ryan?
0679746048|5.0|This is a really cool book. It was recommended to me by a friend and I have nothing bad to say about it. I think my favorite character, besides Susanna, was Daisy. Strange...none of them seemed THAT crazy. It makes you  wonder sometimes...are they crazy, or is it us?
1573226521|3.0|I am a baby boomer (52) and read The Beach as an insight to &quot;Generation X.&quot;  I suspected is was a good window on that generation since reviews of the book divide along demograhpic lines. I was  pulled through the book despite its transparent debt to Lord of the Flies  and On the Road.  Those who do not like the book seem to feel it adds  nothing to the &quot;road&quot; genre or literature in general and they are  correct.  But it's debt to the earlier books doesn't mean it has to extend  or enlarge them.  I suspect Garland's purpose was to communicate the  &quot;running on auto pilot&quot; mind set of twenty somethings searching  for authentic experience in their lives and he got that just right judging  by the adoration of that age group.  Actually, I'd venture a guess that  Garland didn't finish the novel he started but tacked on the incongruent  ending when he couldn't get all the diffuse characters/story lines to come  together in any credibly coherent way.  He was left with a diminished story  but he still had the context and feelings of these travelers and it was  worthy of publication.  I came to respect, if not enjoy the very flat  narrative voice of the novel.  It was errie to follow this bunch of self  proclaimed &quot;trekkers&quot; on their exotic travels but to feel little  sense of adventure or even fun: they found Eden but it barely raised their  pulse.  Excitement seemed to come only from danger and danger was either  vicariously co-opted from Viet Nam or contrived as in swimming the  underwater caves or shadowing the dope guards.  As a Viet Nam veteran I  initially resented the vacant allusions to Viet Nam (West-More-Land, give  me a break!) but came to understand that such borrowing was a way for these  listless characters to bring some substance to their lives. The Beach  deserves praise not so much for what it accomplishes but what it attempts.   I felt Garland, intentionally or not, indited these young travelers for  living in bad faith; for defaulting on the opportunity of their youth and  resources to live useful, or at least interesting, lives.  I am an admitted  generational voyeur and feel I did receive insight into a part of the  twenty something mentality.  However, this book did not rise to literature  because Garland failed to bring his characters to the end their feckless,  anemic lives dictated.  Instead he just employed a violent deus ex machina  and let them off the hook.  Nonetheless, it was a wonderful first novel.   Garland should be watched.

0316286869|5.0|As soon as I laid eyes on it I knew it was for me.  I was bored in an airport and decided to go to the bookstore (guess what I found?)This book provides in simple terms the basics of make-up for beginners.  There are  very diverse looks for anyone.  I'm so excited now about putting on  make-up! Trust me, you'll love it and it's a great gift. If you're thinking  about purchasing it try amazon.com (it is cheaper)!  I would recommend it  for anyone.
B000002GYI|5.0|Wonderfull , brilliant , clean , perfect , you name it !!! The album I had as a &quot;new wave kid&quot; back then on LP , I still have as a grouchy old 30-year old now on CD . Guess some things do stay the same ( thank God  for that ) . As mechanical , soulless , etc. this music is ( or should I  say is being accused to be ), listen to it... and you'll find more of the  wormth , emotions and human feelings behind every note &amp; word , than  you'd find in the music of all those cheap junior-high schoolgirls'  heartbreaking generic idols like Celine Dion , Mariah Carey ,Janet Jackson  and the rest of the garbage .  Buy Computer World , listen to it , enjoy it  !!!
B000002IPZ|5.0|Let's face it.  All great bands come to and end sometime or another.  Testament is no exception.  Before becoming another Korn/Zombie style band, they were without a doubt the best thrash band out there.  Alex Skolnick's  solos shred everyone out there, including Friedman and Hammett!  Chuck  Billy has unreal vocals that bury deep into your memory.  This is the best  Testament album out there.  So if you love 80's metal thrash, BUY THIS  ALBUM!
B00000FCBC|5.0|Garage Inc. is a godsend.  I must say that the new recordings are good but I STILL believe that the second disc truly rocks.  If you were a fan years before the black album then you already know how good the songs on the  second disc are.  If you weren't then listen what metallica truly was.   Either way this has something for the vintage fan and the new fan.  Buy it.

B000000W5L|5.0|With it's rusty low-life lyrics and the most perfect imperfect musical production in rock history, &quot;Exile On Main st.&quot; stands out as the ultimate stones' masterpiece. &quot;Banquet&quot; may have had  &quot;sympathy for the devil&quot;, Let it Bleed its &quot;gimmie  shelter&quot; and &quot;you can't always get what you want&quot;. No such  luck awaits you here. This CD is a private dark masterpiece of daily life.  The raw energies of &quot;satisfaction&quot; and &quot;street fighting  man&quot; have finally found their place. the stones have accomplished the  intospective task of bringing back popular music to the place where it  started from: despair.<br />But that only serves to increase our wonder: How  can such a jet-set band produce 18 &quot;basement&quot; songs, yet retain  the anger and freshness that are only associated with starving  adolescents?? How did these infamous british gentlemen manage to sound more  american than than many luisiana born artists??.  If you want just one  stones' album, don't buy this one. But if you want to get only one  rock'n'roll album, this should be your first pick. This, and not sgt.  peppers, is exactly what it's all about.

B0000019PA|5.0|This album has been woefully ignored by much of the mainstream press in their best of the year lists. For my money, though, it's far and away the best rock record of 1998. It's definately a concept album (although each  song holds up independently) about twisted family romances, love, death,  loneliness and loss. Musically, it breathes new life into some tired indie  formulas with horns and other less conventional instruments, pasting  together interesting genre pastiches--from folk to jazz to punk. But it's  also catchy as hell! And if you ever get a chance to see these guys  live--they put on a phenomenal show.
B000002UAU|3.0|Regardless to what you have heard this is not the best album ever made or even the best Beatles album(The White Album has to be the best).Paul Mcartney heard the Beach Boys&quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and was influenced to  make an album that musically broke all the barriers in pop music.  Unfortunately for Mcartney, you can't get any better than &quot;Pet  Sounds&quot;. Sgt. Pepper has to be the most overrated album in pop  history. Save your money and buy &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; instead.
B000002H97|2.0|A Metallica song used to be a work of art.  Now, like many great acts that have achieved commercial success, I feel Metallica has just gotten lazy.  These new tracks are nothing but neat, packaged, made-for-radio plastic  that do not do &quot;justice&quot; to incredible talent of all four of the  band's members. Metallica continues to be my favorite band of all time, but  of their 7 LP's, this is in my opinion their worst, followed by the  &quot;Load&quot; series.

B000002513|5.0|Everyone once in a while, the backgrouns music of your life comes to the foreground. Whether it be at the office, in the car, under the hood; there is a moment where you lift your head up and stare for a moment at nothing  while your mind stretches towards the radio and you think: &quot;What's  that?&quot;<br />That's the way I felt when listening to &quot;New York City  Serenade&quot; for the first time. And the rest of the album was not much  different. Buy it.
0792838769|2.0|The movie was an excellent commercial for BMW.  True, there were a few action scenes and explosions between the shots of racing beemer cars and bikes.  But they were a bit distracting.  It would have been better to just  show the 740i and the motorcycle without any of that fluff.  The car is  beautiful and the bike is awesome.  As far as Bond movies go, the girls  were..... okay and Pierce Brosnan is pretty good but he was better in  Goldeneye which is a better movie anyway (Beemer gets the Z3 advertised in  that one).

B00000DHRZ|3.0|The Offspring has really lightened up for this one.  When I heard &quot;Pretty Fly&quot; on the radio, I had know idea who did it?  Was it the Beasties?  When I found out it was the Offspring I said ,&quot;no  way.&quot;  It's a good album and probably worth more stars to fans of the  Offspring and of this type of alternative in general, but I don't believe  it will be in car CD players 5 years from now.  It's no &quot;Ten&quot; by  Pearl Jam.  Believe it or not, though, the Springers are only about 2 CD's  short of a &quot;Best of..&quot; compilation.

B00000AFWW|4.0|Not as hard hitting as &quot;Live Through This,&quot; but a tremendous effort nonetheless.  I think Corgan really helps any work he puts his hands on (I'd like to hear him produce Paul McCartney).  I'm not as impressed  with the best songs on this album as I was &quot;Doll Parts&quot;,  &quot;Softer Softest&quot;, and &quot;Violet&quot; but this CD is more  consistent than &quot;Live...&quot; was.  It reminds me of &quot;Tiny  Music&quot; by STP for some reason, possibly because that was also a switch  to a more pop style that worked.
0451527178|3.0|Merchant/Ivory made a good film out of a mediocre novel. As usual with Forster, there are no characters I can really identify with or like too well. At least in &quot;A Passage to India&quot; the portrayal of the  vagueries of life in India was masterful. Here it's just a competent  comment on class. And has anyone noticed?: The final sentence is lousy.
B000000WA4|5.0|This one takes its place alongside The Beatles' White Album and &quot;London Calling&quot; by the Clash.  The centuries 3 best double albums(CDs).  I must have listened to this 500 times now, and I'm still  trying to figure out everything that Billy and the band is trying to say  (I'm not even sure if this is a concept album or not).  Usually, I like to  whittle double CD's down to one great one, but there really isn't any song  on this CD I could do without. The songs alternate between haunting,  beautiful, catchy and agressive.  I just pop one in after the other, then  after 2 hours of listening, I catch my breath.  Tremendous.  This one is  better than &quot;Ten&quot; and &quot;Nevermind.&quot;  One of the top ten  albums ever made.
0684803356|2.0|Hemingway wrote many good things, but this isn't one of them. The title refers to a poem by John Donne, in which the poet seems to suggest that the tribulations of any humans are the business of others as well. Hemingway  has applied this notion to the Spanish Civil War, of which he was a  first-hand witness. The plight of the Spaniards here should be the concern  of all of us. The problem is, his point is clearly made by the title, and  the rest of the book does nothing to improve upon it. This long tome about  rebels trying to blow up a bridge ends poorly; the characters don't arouse  too much sympathy, and the whole thing goes nowhere, except where the fine  title has already taken it.
0451160916|5.0|WOW!  Such a good book!  I saw the movie for the first time, loved it, and then I got the book.  The book is very different from the movie, but it is really good. You just can't put the book down when you start! Before you  know it, you're already far into the book!!  For those who have seen the  movie or not, and are pondering whether or not to get the book here at  Amazon.com, BUY IT!!!
0671015206|3.0|I enjoyed the book on the whole, but I found myself racing to the end so I could &quot;finish it.&quot;  The book does offer ways in which to live below your means and I agree with other reviewers in their skepticism of  'not spending a penny.&quot;<br />Wealth can be defined in many ways and the  goal of being a millionaire for most is: I want millions and I want to live  like I have millions.  <br />Reading this book changed my view--having a  million dollars is no longer my goal--saving and investing what I can,  while leading a happy life is much more important than saving or spending  all of it.  <br />One last point for parents who are passing along money to  their children--read the second half of the book.  Your children will  reflect your values as they pertain to money--be careful what messages you  send them with your gifts.
6301647734|5.0|I love this movie.  It is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Jimmy Stewart is great in it.
B00000AFFI|5.0|Amidst all the bare-naked dreck of popular music comes the singular Polly Jean Harvey.  In her latest release, PJ comes into her own with her trademark bass, distortion, layering and the voice.  Oh what a voice.  No  one can touch PJ, just ask her female compatriots who are suitably in awe  of her awesome talent (Alanis, Madonna, Courtney all bow before her).  You  deserve it, worth the click, listen and see how a true artist sounds as the  century winds down.
B000002MG1|5.0|This is by far the best album out of R.E.M.  Every song is great.  Man on the Moon and Everybody hurts are two songs that will be etched into the memory of every listener.  Buck is amazing with the guitar and Stipe's  voice is unique.  If you buy this album I guarantee that you won't be  disappointed.
B000002OR4|5.0|One of the few soundtracks that i can actually sit down and listen to without skipping through any tracks.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I agree with Stein for the most part.  This is indeed a special disc.  In my mind, it is up there with Kind of Blue, Blonde on Blonde, and Nevermind as one of those albums that stop you cold on your tracks and make think,  listen and enjoy.  Get it now!
B000009DUY|5.0|At first it may be hard to get used too, but the more I listen to it the more I like it.  John Williams is still one of the best.
6300151379|5.0|I have been trying to find this movie for about 2 years.  My son made a copy in the late 80s, but it's fuzzy now.  Why do so many of the Disney classics get reprinted (for a limited time!), but not this one?  We all  need to relax and enjoy fantasyland as often as possible.  Please request  several reprints.
B000002NFM|5.0|I listen to different bands in spurts - &amp; Prodigy is one where once I pull the CD out &amp; listen to it once, I'm stuck on it for months. This is such an excellent CD that I can listen to it @ least twice a day for  months before I finally get tired of it. I've had it for over a year now  &amp; I'm still listening to it @ least once a day. It's great music that  keeps you moving - no matter where you are, @ work or in your car.
0061002860|5.0|If I could suggest a top five compilation of Christie's best, this would definitely be amoung them (Evil Under the Sun, Murder in Mesopotamia, Death on the Nile, Why Didn't They Ask Evans).  However, I do agree with a  previous poster who urged that this book not by the first Christie you ever  read.
0670880728|3.0|For months I was anticipating sitting down with this book, and once I did, I have to admit I was a bit disappointed. Yes, it is very funny, yet I find Bridget's obsessions to be something I experienced during my teen-age years  and early 20s. I'm now 34, and couldn't find a single issue of hers  relevant to my own life now. I always believed that the Brits matured much  sooner than we Americans. Now, I'm beginning to wonder. I wanted to say to  Bridget, get over it. Move on. You're in your 30s; take responsibility for  your own life. Especially, because it would be demeaning to finally find a man to take care of you for the rest of your life. We're approaching the new Millennium. We women are more independent now than we've ever been. Don't depend on a man for happiness. Find it within yourself. Create the life you want, than find a man to share it with. Otherwise you'd still be miserable. I just couldn't find this book funny. Only depressing and unenlightening.

6300246787|5.0|I first saw HELLO, DOLLY! when I was sick, and no matter how silly this may sound, it really did just cheer me up.  Although a bit silly at times, this movie will have you ready to get up and dance!  The characters are  sometimes ridiculous, but quite lovable, and Barbara Streisand plays a  wonderful, bubbly Dolly Levi who wants you to &quot;just leave everything  to me!&quot;  The energy and enthusiasm put into this movie is contagious,  and will leave you feeling happy.  (silly though it sounds, it's true!) The  songs are wonderful, and the dancing marvelous.  Look for guest Louis  Armstrong who directs the band that plays the title song HELLO, DOLLY!  A  great movie!  I highly recommend this for a few laughs!
B000001FS6|5.0|I've loved this album since the first time I heard it ... I wore all the lettering off my cassette, I played it so much.  &quot;Van Diemen's Land&quot;, the thunder of &quot;Desire&quot; and &quot;Angel of  Harlem&quot; ... really great stuff.  Of the two covers, IMHO, &quot;Helter  Skelter&quot; doesn't work as well as the Beatles' original, while Bono  kicks into great vocal gear on &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot;.  Hendrix is without question one of the best rock guitarists of all time,  but I think Bono's the better vocalist, far and away.<br />I miss the passion  and intensity U2 used to put into their music.  I don't think it's there  any more.

This book actually makes you grow , not physically but - how  can I explain - It made me feel reborn , in Francie's shoes . I 've read  the book 6 times and am planning to read it again . I recommend this book  to all people .<br />I also don't understand how anyone could rate this  masterpiece anywhere under 5 stars ! These are the ones who flip through  the book and say &quot; too long , too many pages , I don't feel like  reading. &quot; Please listen to me - I'm 13 , and truthfully say this:A  Tree Grows in Brooklyn will always be the best written novel you shall ever  read .
6303921248|5.0|Who doesn't fall madly in love with Mr. Darcy and Miss Bennet from the first moments of this movie?  The story is absolutely true to the book, and the characters are so warmly portrayed by the actors, that every time I  finish watching the 6 hour series of tapes, I feel like I'm putting my  dearest friends away in a box on my shelf!  Even my husband, a total  &quot;Terminator&quot; kind of guy, loves this movie.

6303407188|5.0|This is a deeply personal film by Tim Burton, and so he has put a great deal of time and trouble into making it. It shows. <br /> The acting is superb, the story engaging, and the 'feel' of the movie is unequalled in  modern cinema. It makes you feel so much for Ed Wood Jnr. that you almost  wish that he had succeeded in making it big. <br /> Glorious.
6305252521|5.0|Where can I begin?  Every aspect of the movie is fantastic.  The gradual way in which we see Truman dawning on the truth is wonderful.  And Carey...He IS this role, it is as if it was written for him.  The product  placing gags are soooooo funny too.  I strongly recomend this film, '98's  best with out a doubt.
B00000DGUG|5.0|When I first listened to this CD my reaction was: What is this stuff?  But I made myself listen to the CD all the way through two more times and found that even the songs that I thought were annoying at first have a depth and  sophistication that are just shocking considering Ms. Morissette's age!!   Her music and her sensitive and highly intelligent lyrics are refreshingly  original.  I feel like I'm listening to music from another planet - a  planet with more a intellectually advanced and emotionally sophisticated  race of beings.  I would love to meet this incredible young woman whose  talent and intellect just amaze me!! - Patti Morrissey Barwinczak

This has got to be the best movie musical ever made.  If you are a fan of wonderful  singing, staging, and especially DANCING - this is the movie for you! If  you need more than Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor for your dancing thrills  - then maybe your standards are a tad too high.  This is the BEST!

0440217563|5.0|This author has a way of dragging a reader right in and making them forget EVERYTHING. I rushed breathlessly through 'Outlander', 'Dragonfly in Amber', and 'Voyager', and the only thing that is keeping me from rushing  into the bedroom and grabbing my copy of 'Drums of Autumn' is the terrible  knowledge that there will be nothing left to read after that one is  finished! I almost wish I had waited until Diana Gabaldon had completed the  series before I started because waiting for 'Fiery Cross' will be pure  torture. 'Voyager' gave so many unexpected thrills. I quickly adjusted to  my disapointment of Claire and Jamie having been apart for 20 years and  fell to enjoying their life together again. From Scotland, across the high  seas, to the isles of the Carribean and beyond, I was lost in the adventure  of it all. I had come to love Scotland so much that I thought I would hate  to leave it but I had just as much fun on the high seas with this pair and  their entertaining entourage. So wonderfully talented is this author that  one can actually BE with Jamie and Claire as they share life and love.  Please hurry and finish the rest of the series, Ms. Gabaldon! Life will be  so dull until you do! Kristy
0446364495|1.0|This waste of time gets no rating whatsoever from me. (However, I had to select a rating from the list; too bad ZERO stars hadn't been an option.)  I find it hard to believe ANYONE could like this book.  Those people who  did like it apparently are from the trashy-love-novel fan club.  An  absolutely awful book...
0440178002|5.0|This was awesome.  It had the perfect characters and setting.  I learned a whole lot about history. This is heart breaking story of an English captain stranded on the shore of Japan, and by chance swept up into a civil war.
B000002HMH|3.0|I was put off from buying this when I heard &quot;Until it Sleeps&quot; on the radio, so I waited until a friend got it, and basically the only track reminiscent even of their last album was &quot;King Nothing.&quot; There is  no &quot;crunch&quot; on any of these songs, no good hooks, and it's been  slowed down considerably. Hetfield's voice has matured, but he sounds  pretty dull and complacent, as if he thought the only way to demonstrate  his improved singing was to sing with no growl at all. The lyrics are a bit  embarrassing to listen to at times.<br /><br /><br />Now don't get me wrong, I love  blues and jazz, and I can sometimes stand southern rock, but I don't think  Metallica did any of those styles well here. While I find it interesting  that Metallica started experimenting away from thrash metal, they also  seemed to completely abandon all the compositional skills they showed in  their first four or five albums. Before, they had a good feel for musical  progression, aided by those furiously fast riffs, so they could write  really long songs. By slowing down their music and tossing out changes of  loudness and tempo, basically starting and ending songs at arbitrary  points, they still sound okay, but Load would be much beter if it had been  a good 25-30 minutes shorter. Some of these songs really die midway, and  only a couple really work.<br /><br /><br />I believe that Metallica _did_  &quot;sell out&quot; in a way (they cut their hair, slowed down their  music, and the whole band adopted petulant expressions for their album  photos), but this wouldn't have mattered if the music itself was as good as  their previous stuff. But it isn't. You can't write six or seven minute  songs that are so straightforward, especially when they're slowed down.  Metallica once knew that (just listen to &quot;One&quot; or &quot;Master of  Puppets&quot;), but seem to have forgotten. A pity.

6300151379|5.0|Labryinth......What a GREAT movie. Just like some of my favorite CD's I have not been able to find it in stock ANYWHERE. David Bowie plays a menacing yet mysterious Goblin King which I think makes the movie as GREAT  as it is. Personally I think that it is a Marvel for the Puppet industry  and Jim Hensons Finest achievement. For those of you who like fantasy,  suspense, action and GREAT music in a movie, this is the one for you....If  you can find it. If you do let me know!!! If I could truly rate it I would  give it 6 stars!!!
6302994063|5.0|After watching Strictly Ballroom over 100 times, I tried to pinpoint exactly what made me love it.  The fact that it's set in Australia is fun and a twist.  Scott is attractive, and Fran blossoms throughout the movie.   The dancing is awesome.  The dialogue is witty.  The best thing about this  movie is it's magic.  It's a movie that sweeps me away, and makes me feel a  part of it.  See it.  You'll love it.

With Loreena McKennitt, it's not just Celtic music or Sufi music, but pure, undefiled, and fresh music which can touch people  the world over.

0812550706|5.0|This book is testimony to the limits, or lack there of, that a species is willing to test, to cross, when the survival of the species is &quot;on the line&quot;.  After the Buggers second invasion, the world rallied under one  government to form a more powerful, stronger, and unified race.  Under this  new government, the atrocity commited, the sacrifice made, the sin, the  indignity suffered was the deception, betrayl, and warping of childhood  innocence.  For the survival of the species, the government saw fit to  breed humans and steal children for the &quot;greater good&quot;.  The  greater good in this case, was nothing so trivial as more power or more  money; it was to ensure survival. This book and all the sequels are  excellent reading.  I recomend these books to anyone interested in the  ethical values of government, humans, and/or aliens.  For those who just  enjoy a good science fiction read, they are still excellent.  Sequels:  Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, and Children of the Mind.

0156421178|5.0|I could not put down Orwell's gripping story of his involvement in the Spanish Civil War and the politics behind the Republican side.  His tale is fascinating, and even the political discussions read as smoothly as his  novels.
630305904X|5.0|If you see this for the first time on video, you'll probably wish you'd seen it when it was still in theatres (or at least you'll want to see it in widescreen).  The cinematograpy is both unusual in its makeup and  breathtaking besides, and well-suited to a larger screen.  <br />The movie  chronicles several _centuries_ of her life; Orlando's character changes not  only from male to female, but from immature to mature in a number of ways.   It's a journey which is strange, sensual, and extraordinary all at the same  time, and leaves you wondering what happens next... &quot;next&quot; being  after the movie ends as &quot;her life is just beginning.&quot; <br />The  soundtrack is also very well thought out... and if you're invested enough,  the ending song brings tears to your eyes.  Great movie for all lovers of  art films...but although not a &quot;chick flick&quot; per se, Orlando  probably will appeal more to the female sex simply for its themes.  The  sentiments expressed by Orlando as he/she changes and matures, however,  will doubtless be universally appreciated!
0441172717|5.0|this book(and its sequel) is an incredible nonstopping flow. the base/start of an incredible story...(read the sequels)....its been a tremendous pleasure reading it..
B00000DHR0|5.0|This Christmas I listened to two albums. One being &quot;These Are Special Times&quot; It will be the defining moment of my Christmas &quot;98.  Celine's voice is &quot;pure magic&quot;!!!!
1558908455|5.0|If you like Tarantino-esque action movies with Rodriguez flare, you'll love this one. If you enjoyed Desperado and Reservoir Dogs this is a 'must see'.
6300151379|5.0|This is a great movie for all ages.For the children you have the master of puppets, Jim Henson, and for the adults you have Bowie and his excellent singing talents. I grew up on this movie. I was 8 (now 16) when I first saw  it, and fell in love with it. This is a movie worthy of a reprint.
0790729350|5.0|Mr. Wadleigh's striking documentary is truly spectacular.  Anyone who experienced those times, as well as any fan of good music from the 60's and 70's will thoroughly enjoy this work.  The enhancement to digital format  has been accomplished tastefully and adds striking texture to a film  already littered with realism.  Humor, love, anger, and truth are all  represented in hours of interviews with concert-goers, band members,  ancillary staff, and locals.  This in itself would be enough to entertain.   However, some of the best concert footage ever filmed is included.   Although I belong to the generation which followed that represented in the  film, this feature is one of the most often viewed in my collection.  One  word of caution to parents of young children - drug use, which defined an  aspect of the festival, is well depicted.   Otherwise, this is certainly  one for the collection of any fan or follower of that era of music or  philosophy.  Also of note, listening to the music in digital surround may  be as good or better than a front row seat in 1969!
1574530011|2.0|I had to read this book for my 9th grade Intro to Ideas class. While many of my peers despised the book, I somewhat liked it, but only because I had already had an innate interest in philosophy. Yes, this is a thinly  disguised textbook with a ridiculous, unimaginitive plot. The book would  actually have been better as a textbook without the pathetic storyline, or  whatever storyline you try to make out of it
0788811355|5.0|I am made to watch all my wifes romances on TV and video, usually they bore my arse off. The English Patiant is differant. You are slowly drawn into the story, intially it confuses, but as it unfolds, you are by turn,  lifted and dumped by the shear brilliance of the plot. The end is stunning.  If you can hold back the tears your central nervous system has been  removed! Awesome film
6304813759|5.0|Although not my favorite (you have to go see There's Something About Mary), this is one of my Top 5 for sure. It's about out-of-job and out-of-luck ex-steelworkers who decide to strip in order to make some  money. Yeah, that doesn't sound very attractive, but the comedy will  attract you. Go see it, dammit!
0671015206|3.0|Although simplistic and repetitive, I am glad that I read this book. The notion of deferring dollars and pleasures for a later day, is one I will gladly have repeated to me. It is a no-brainer for some people and I can  see why there are one-stars given. I can also see why people rave about  it...self-help sells.<br />I think wisdom falls somewhere between the  philiosophy of these authors and the carpe diem mentality. I probably lean  towards the notion of saving, you can 'seize the day' without driving a new  BMW.
630200084X|5.0|This is the best film I have ever seen. It is that simple. Any person with even a bit of romance in them would enjoy this.
B000003RCY|4.0|I think this is a good CD.  I love Rammstein's music, the German vocals, battering ram guitar.  But also--an industrial band that can play stuff besides techno ripoffs and cheesy fast dance pieces!
B000002NJS|5.0|I find Madonna really cool.I love her voice, style and sound affects. I guarantee this is not a waste of time or money.This CD is definatly one of Madonna's best and a inspiration to anyone, anywhere!
B00000DGUG|1.0|This CD is a departure from her previous CD in that this one stinks in comparison.  It is moody and slow and has no catchy tunes except for the third track which was used to preview the CD.  Even then, the quality of  the recording itself is scratchy and bad.  I've heard better recordings  from an album.  Whether this was intentional or not, I don't know.  But the  radio version has the same clicks, pops, and gaps in the music as my CD, so  I have to assume.  I don't know what Alanis is trying to say with this  release, but it pales in comparison to Jagged Little Pill.  That CD is one  you can listen to and enjoy every song.  With this latest release, you have  to force yourself to like something.  Not worth my money.  Too bad.  I was  really looking forward to a better followup than this.
0440180295|5.0|When I started reading the book I had other plans.  I put these off though because I couldn't stop reading.  Easily Vonnegut's best book. Easy to read compared to his others with but you are just as engrossed.  A must read!
6303675212|5.0|Few remakes do justice to the original classic and even fewer improve on it.  This one does both.  Mara Wilson is wonderful and gives a once in a lifetime performance. In an effort to put a twist on the original they  changed the scene where Santa speaks a foreign language to a child come to  sit on his lap and instead he uses sign language to speak to a hearing  impaired child.  The result is a very touching scene.   John Hughes has  done it again!
0141301066|5.0|I first picked up Matilda when I was ten, (actually I got it from my mom for christmas, cause I asked her for it) and I haven't been able to put it down since. I think that Roald Dahl's books are so imaginative and utterly  fantastical in every way; I love all of his books, but Matilda is my  favorite. <br />Matilda is extremely bright, brilliant and sensitive, despite  her age, and she manages to cope with her intellectually opposite parents  by playing wickedly delightful tricks on them every time they treat her  especially badly.<br />I was enraptured by this book, and suggest it to  anyone, old or young, because everyone has a little child in them, and  everyone loves a smile brought to their faces thanks to a delightful book!
6305265488|5.0|Drew Barrymore and Dougry Scott make an excellent couple as well as put on a extraodinary performance. This movie is based on the classic fairy tale of Cinderella. But it adds some intresting conflicts between the  charecters. Angelica Housten fits the part of the step-mother perfectly! I  highly recomend this movie to anyone of any age!
0800129806|2.0|This is a good,not great, movie. Its nice to look at more than anything else, with handsome actors and decent performances. For anyone who knows about the Arthurian Legend, the movie 'Excalibur' is far and away the best,  even though it has its' own flaws. Still, it has many wondrous moments that  'First Knight' lacks. Lancelot in Excalibur is much better than Gere. First  Knight seems to almost wholly disregard the legend of the Grail, Lady of  the Lake and anything else that makes this legend so special. First Knight  is a nice movie to rent, but Excalibur is a movie you should OWN.
B0000013GT|5.0|ATliens is mind-blowing.  In this well-planned, extremely thought out album, Outkast takes rap to an unprecedented level.  Mixing southern break beats and harmonies with true-to-life lyrics, Dre and Big Boi will leave  you dying for more.  If you buy any single album in the next 10 years, get  this one.  I swear to god, youll end up thanking me if you do.
B000000OTU|5.0|This was my very first Aerosmith CD I bought. I only got it for 2 song but I ended up loving the whole CD!!! I'm now staring to collect all of their CD's. There isn't one song, so far, that I haven't liked!
0800196767|5.0|This movie has a unique magical twist to it. Danny once again has done it. He fits his part perfectly. He plays the snooty father of a young girl with an amazing brain and imagination.Danny refuses to buy her a book and  encourage her amazing mind, so she gets even.
B000002NJS|2.0|What happened to Madonna? Her latest album is really not worthy of her talents.  The musicianship is amaturish and worse the lyrics are an embarrasment.  I really don't want to hear about Madonna's discovery that  the world does not revolve around her.  I am happy she now has a child that  she loves.  Thank god she does just have herself to think about any more.   Another embarrasment is the graphic overlayed on top of her photo in the CD  booklet. Are we to understand that the &quot;Ray of Light&quot; is  Madonna's nipple?  This  is really bad!  Skip this one but give her another  try later.
B00000G3PA|5.0|This movie with its special effects, story line and the adventure is without a question, the best that I have ever seen. Also the best ever made by Bruce Willis. And I cannot wait to purchase it when it comes out on DVD.  Bruce Willis has finally played a more believable character.
B00000BKDZ|5.0|When an artist or band makes an album as good as this one, it's almost impossible to live up to the expectations of making a better one next time. Adrian Smith and Bruce Dickinson must have known this, because they both  departed from Maiden. (Dickinson stayed for two more albums) You can't  blame Iron Maiden though--Seventh Son was just TOO good to top.
0800184327|5.0|It was the BEST!  I bought the CD as soon as it came out and some of the music brought tears to my eyes, so beautiful it was!  then I felt like dancing the night away.  A MUST see! I even took my four year old to see  the movie and he loved it as well.
6305127638|5.0|The best Star Trek films have dealt with villains that we viewers have had some history with. Star Trek 2 had Captain Kirk battling with an old nemesis named Khan who had appeared on the old television series. The  villains in First Contact, the Borg, appeared several times on the Next  Generation.  The Borg are back with a vengeance in this explosive  combination of action and drama, and with this one, you don't have to be a  fan to enjoy it. Oozing with amazing acting, special effects and Trek-lore,  First Contact succeeds in bringing a long time villain to the big screen  with enough oomph to blow you away.
B000002WYT|5.0|This is an excellent album by DMB. It mixes smoothe relaxing songs with other energetic tunes.My favorite songs are Two step,Lie in our graves and say goodbye.
B00000DHTF|5.0|An excellent presentation of Bruce's original style with the E-Street Band. Gives new incentive for the band to re-unite in the coming year. My personal favorite since &quot;Tunnel of Love.&quot;
B00000DFRS|2.0|I love Whitney Houston and feel that she has the best voice in the industry, but I must say I was very disappointed by the very &quot;average&quot; songs on this CD.  With a voice as powerful and capable  as hers, she doesn't have to settle for such mediocre material.  Sure there  are some good ones, her duet with Mariah Carey was fabulous, but even  Whitney sounded bored to me.  The whole thing left me looking forward to  her next CD and hoping it's not such a long wait.
6302054982|5.0|if you like mafia movies this one is for you.  I would recommend not having children watch it however, due to its violent script.  DeNiro is wonderful and convincing.
B000002NHN|5.0|If you thought the Celts were limited to the Isles and western Europe, think again.  Aural travel agent Loreena McKennitt is again punching tickets for her unusual excursion train.  Travel across Siberia, the  Steppes, Italy...  Incredible album with an incredible and ecclectic mix of  world instruments.  This woman takes Celtic deeper than anyone in the  business, a passionate obsession if you will.  You cannot however know  everything about Loreena's musical prowess without also owning &quot;The  Visit&quot; and &quot;the mask &amp; mirror&quot; as &quot;The Book of  Secrets&quot; is one more stone in the Celtic history wall.  Many say that  Loreena may have broadened her music too far with this album but I tend to  disagree.  I just think many more people are finally finding her on their  own.  Rightfully and thankfully so.   Enjoy all she has to offer.
B000002JS8|5.0|When I heard this album for the first time, I was really amazed with the power, feeling and differenciality of it. This album is, no doubt, the best what AC/DC has ever released. I enjoy listening to this record almost every  day.
0792838637|5.0|I bought the silver special edition DVD of this movie by accident and glad I did because I understand the 'cheaper' movie edition is missing a lot of the neat special features that the silver edition has.  This includes the  director and special effects men talking over the movie on how they did it  all, and a complete summary of the BOND mistique.  Well worth a few extra  bucks for a serious DVD collection.
B00000G3PA|1.0|You have to be a silly teenie bopper to like this
6304916558|5.0|Action plus and incredible sound effects.  The DVD set up is best with the &quot;Special Edition&quot; silver packaging and includes interesting special features on the disk.  Enjoy.
0792151712|1.0|I will never understand how James Cameron, a director of movies only worth seeing once, is being named a genuis. The only reason the damn movie is so popular is because modern society has lost romance, so pregnant teenagers  need to get that warm mushy feeling from &quot;Leo.&quot; I'll grant you  the kid's a decent actor, I thought he was very good in Marvin's Room, but  aren't you people taking this thing a bit far. I could understand hearing  it's a good movie or even a very good movie, but a GREAT FILM! What's even  more pitiful was Leo's next movie following Titanic, The Man in the Iron  Mask. It's frightening to think that half the teenage girls who saw this  film did not realize it was a combination of Dumas The Three Musketeers and  The Man in the Iron Mask (Dumas wrote the two books). Have Fuller, Marker,  Mizoguchi, Mekas, Dreyer, etc. etc. been forgotten. Only a select few have  called them great filmakers, and yet the whole world is screaming for James  Cameron.  Thanks for your time
078401213X|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen this year.  A very surreal and deep movie, with some incredible visuals.  No director has ever portrayed a migraine headache as vividly as in this movie!
B00000DHRZ|4.0|If you love the Humor of Pretty Fly, you'll really enjoy the Offspring's cover and twist of the Seventies' Hit &quot;Feelings&quot;.
6304240562|5.0|Dawn of the Dead has been number two on my top 102 movies that I own.  Star Wars remains number one. Dawn is a classic.  The originality, creativity of people resorting to a shopping mall as a fortification  against zombies. This film was destined to be made.  Night of the Living  Dead was nice, Day of the Dead was cute, but, DAWN OF THE DEAD is a  masterpiece.  Superb acting, and a great story line.
0374266425|5.0|This book pacts a real interest in the story and gives an overall feeling of all the major philosophers.  If anybody had ever wondered about philosophy and the subject matter of the major philosophical views, then  this book is the best one to read.
B000000LZV|5.0|I was at a party the other night and a friend pointed out that the album gets its title from the fact he's driving at 55mph on hwy 10. its trucker talk or something.    aside from that - yes, this is one album that will  never leave my collection.   If I ever lost this album, it would be a quick  re-buy.
6305177473|3.0|This was a cute movie but no where near as good as the original.  There is no way they could replace the stars in the original.  Don't buy this one, buy the real thing.
6304819935|5.0|Okay, there's a simple fact here.  The series began with The Evil Dead, at the end of that film we see the spirit making it's way toward Ash, he screams and it's over.  Now the 2nd film starts off with him driving to the  cabin. But he IS NOT returning to it. This film makes it seem like there  never was a fird ED film. ED2 still really picks up where ED left off, but  Mr. Raimi added the footage of going to the cabin so the audience would not  be completely lost.  ED2 really starts off with Ash flying through the sky.   and it ends with him landing in Medieval times.  AoD(Army of  Darkness)picks the story up just as he comes out of the vortex.That's the  problem with having 3 different distributors.  Now I did a bit of editing.   I got all 3 films and put them together into one continuous film.  And it  is great.  I consider them all one movie because that is how they were  meant to be.  This is my all time favorite &quot;horror&quot; series.  And  Bruce, you are a god to me.
B00000DHTF|4.0|As a hard core Springsteen fan who has been listening to many of these songs for years now (on bootlegs, tape trading amongst fans, etc.) it's interesting to read how others are reacting to these songs, now publicly  released for the first time.  The skinny of it is there are SO many Bruce  songs out there that are equal to or better than the songs on his studio  releases.  Unfortunately, as usual, Bruce left many of them off here, and  included a lot of really weak stuff.  Why?  I'm as puzzled as anyone.  And  I'm not just talking about the absence of songs such as &quot;Cindy,&quot;  &quot;The Fever,&quot; and &quot;The Promise.&quot;  I'm talking about  lesser known gems such as &quot;Outside Looking In,&quot; &quot;None But  the Brave,&quot; &quot;The Way,&quot; etc.  It's unfortunate that Bruce put  so many weak outtakes on this collection (especially the fourth disc)  because it will give the general public the perception that Bruce's  unreleased material is not that strong.  That's unfortunate, because the  best of this guy's unreleased material is amazing.  Concentrate on songs  from &quot;Tracks&quot; such as &quot;Take 'em as They Come,&quot;  &quot;Iceman,&quot; and &quot;Cynthia,&quot; and you'll know exactly what  I'm talking about.  Again, &quot;Tracks&quot; isn't the best representation  of Bruce's unreleased work, but it's still a great deal.  Purchase this -  the 30 best songs make the whole thing worthwhile.
0800184327|5.0|I loved this movie.  I saw it 6 times.  It may have a typical storyline but I loved the magnetism of the characters that Chayanne and Vanessa portrayed.  It was sensual without being &quot;dirty&quot;, it was charming  and vibrant.  I love the music and especially the dancing.  I have a favor  to ask anyone who may read this.  Is there anyone who can post the words  (Spanish?) to the songs on the CD?  I would like to sing those songs but I  am afraid to sing for fear of saying  the wrong word. Thank you!
630492514X|5.0|This movie was great. It was interesting, had a great plot and Matt Damon was fabulous in it. I think this is going to turn into an alltime favorite.
B000002MG1|5.0|While this album will not likely satisfy the dedicated rockers out there, its uplifting tone, beautiful melodies, and brilliant lyrical qualities make it R.E.M.'s finest effort.  &quot;Find the River&quot; is one of  R.E.M.'s best songs, both musically and lyrically.  &quot;Try Not to  Breathe&quot; follows close behind.  R.E.M. accomplishes wide appeal with  &quot;Everybody Hurts,&quot; a simple but comforting song.  The surreality  of &quot;Sweetness Follows&quot; creates a marvelous effect following  &quot;New Orleans Instrumental No. 1.&quot;  The poorest effort on the  album is likely &quot;Monty Got a Raw Deal,&quot; followed by the misfit  political track &quot;Ignoreland.&quot;  In all, Automatic for the People  is a beautiful album, and though not typical of R.E.M., a brilliant  masterpiece.
B000002L3P|4.0|Like Jonny Lang's debut, this first album by Kenny Wayne Shepherd had me thinking that blues rock was not going to be allowed to die. Unfortunately, both Jonny Lang and Kenny Wayne's second albums put an end to my optimism.  But regardless of where he goes with his career, this album is a great  addition to your blues collection......buy it.
0375405208|2.0|Follett is better than this. Not sure how much time he spent on this but he usually writes better thrillers than this. This was the first book I read on Christmas vaction and I could have invested my time better. If you  live in California, you still might not be intrigued!!
6305079811|4.0|Great soundtrack by QUEEN.  Fun if a little campy remake of the old movie serial.
6304383177|5.0|Hepburn and Grant are at it again in this screwball comedy about a leopard!  Although not quite as good as &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot;, it is a definite must-see for anyone who remotely enjoys Cary Grant or  Katherine Hepburn!
6303029027|5.0|It is not very often a movie gets to me such as A Bronx Tale did.  This is a wondefully directed, acted and produced movie.  After seeing this movie I got to thinking about life.  This movie teaches a true life story of  family, love, race and hatred.  I reccomend this movie to anyone who wants  to watch a real movie.
0486274268|4.0|The book covers several animals (with special detail in the part about horses ). It contains skeleton drawings and muscles of most animals covered.The book also has a few drawings of animals caricatures.
1567407757|4.0|I very much enjoyed this story of farewell.  A good choice for anyone planning to visit a terminally ill friend.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Exceptional musicians...Lots of neat lyrics
B000001IPL|5.0|This is definately one of the best CD's around, I usually get tired of a CD I've had for four years, but I keep listening! This CD has definately outspun any CD in my collection.
0679721037|2.0|We just had to read this story for my freshman english calss. I was of course pleased with how we didn't have to read some tale jumbled with so much symbolisim that we could barely remember the main charactor, but this  was definately on the other end of the spectrum. I feel that this book was  poorly written. The Atom Bomb is such a delicate subject, and it did not  deserve the flavorless writing which was John Hersey's style. I often found  myself bored because The words in the book were simply words, not  passionate writing which I expected. I did give it two stars, because now I  understood what the people of Hiroshima were going through, but the style  of writing which was simply fact, left me bored.
B000002UB6|4.0|This album is a curious mix of old and new ideas, old and new recordings, old and new productions. As such it's a bit of a mish mosh, and yet it bosts the usual four absolute classic Beatles hits, and some jolly fine  performances, particularly those done on the roof of Apple. Phil Spector  cobbled together some different takes here and there, so it's not all audio  verite, but what the heck, we're grateful for what we can get.
6301095294|3.0|&quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; is my vote for the best Beatle movie ever.  This one provides a great deal of their sordid British humor, but one really needs to like the Beatles and to have an open mind to really enjoy  this film.  I thought it was fun, but not their best work.  You can't beat  the music, though.
B000002TYX|5.0|Here we bear audio witness to the growth and development of the early Beatles, to their raw power, enthusiasm, and songwriting innovation. Their focused efficiency in the studio is remarkable. This sounds great. What a  joy to hear these previously unavailable outtakes and live performances.  Oh, and by the way, &quot;Free As A Bird&quot; is a bonus treat.
0385484518|1.0|I am very disappointed with this book and am stunned by the amount of positive reviews.  This book lacked depth.  The main ideas could have been summed up in less than 1000 words, but are repeated over and over.  It is  written at a gradeschool level.  Furthermore, it becomes apparent that  Mitch Albom was in it for the money the entire time (as was Morrie to pay  for medical bills).
0792151712|2.0|Baisicially,Titanic is okay,but the whole &quot;Leo&quot; thing is annoying. All the &quot;Leo&quot; worshipers make the movie embarissing to see because it is pathetic knowing that half the girls in the movie theater  are there only to see Mr. Cute himself. But, other then that the second  part of the movie is safe to see without barfing.And it  is a extra bonus  to see all the preps crying there heads off when Jack dies.
0399143904|5.0|From what I've seen, this hasn't gotten the best of reviews in some places. Why a lot of people didn't like it is obvious to me: Clancy deals with very complex issues and writes very complex books. Many people don't  like complex because they think it's confusing.  But if that is the case,  don't knock it.  This is the best book of the year.
6301442962|5.0|Unfortunate that this movie is only rolled out during Christmas,  its perfect script, perfect casting, and perfect directing makes this movie *THE BEST* of the 20th century.  Its many sub-plots accent the climax of  the movie, when a man selflessly &quot;throws away&quot; a happy future for  the sake of one simple old man...  &lt;--- Republicans could learn from  this!! :)
0380973642|4.0|Although the book reprints several stories from &quot;Angels and Visitations&quot; the new material is spectacular. Particularly the story about silent film stars. It would be very hard for anyone not to enjoy this  book.
6300151379|5.0|I love this movie!  It has everything you want, great puppets from the greatly missed Jim Henson, has David Bowie -=mouth watering=-, and is a wonderful adventure.  I keep checking to see if anyone has this movie, but  nobody does...and if they do, they aren't willing to part with it.  If  you're really lucky, you might get to catch a glimpse on the Disney Channel  (but they haven't shown it lately).  Keep your eyes open!!!  I finally got  the story book, which had to be shipped from England!  Now I also have the  soundtrack...the best thing would be for me to get the movie, now!  Please,  re-print!!!
630157401X|5.0|Out of the three movies in the trilogy I would say this is the best one. What I like about it is it has the Nazi's as the enemy again and it tells about Indy's childlife.  I think Harrison Ford is  the perfect fit for the  part of Indiana. I really enjoyed this video.
B0000025DV|5.0|I have loved ELO since I first heard Sweet Talkin' Woman, and Jeff Lynne in incredible! His melodies are perfect. I hear joy when I listen to anything Jeff does . . .
6305265488|5.0|&quot;Ever After&quot; was a magical story.  I could see this movie over and over again.  This movie gives a whole new dimension to the Cinderella tale that we all know and love.  No one should pass it up.  &quot;Ever  After&quot; is great for the entire family or if your on a date.  I'm  definitely going to buy it the first chance I get!!
0780624890|1.0|We would rate this movie a zero if there was an option for it.  Right from the start it was a total gore film.  Blood coming from the  overhead sprinkler system, get serious.  While the effects were pretty good, this is  no popcorn movie.  That is unless you want to clean up afterwards.
6305265666|5.0|Magic pumpkins, fairy godmothers, talking mice, breaking out into song? Come on. Danielle (Drew Barrymore) is not a delecate little flower waiting for someone to save her. She can take care of herself and does. The love of  the prince (played brillantly by Dougray Scott) didn't make her who she  was, it just made her relize just how incretble she already was. The  supporting cast was amazing. Danielle is strong, smart, and sassy. This  movie give's young girls a role model. This is the only version a  Cinderella I would ever let my daughter see. Showing you don't need anyone  to save you, you can do that yourself. It was funny, smart, romantic and  just plain brilliant. Finally somebody got Cinderella right.
6305177473|5.0|We watched this rented, now buying through Amazon, movie with our five and a half year old boy and girl twins tonite.  The best line in this remake is when the twin girls call the evil new wife-to-be &quot;Carilla(sp?)  DeVille&quot; (the evil woman in 101 Dalmatians).  Both my twins got it  immediately.  Bravo to Disney for a touching and heartwarming late 90's  remake.  As my son, Daniel says, the twins were the &quot;Masters of  disaster&quot;!! You have got to see the movie to see what he means!!!!  Enjoy...
6300214753|5.0|This movie kicks @#%#@% ! Watch it or else.....   I personally guarentee you will laugh eveery 5 seconds. Ferris, his friend, girlfriend and principal are the perfect mix to create the funniest movie you will ever  see!
6305232660|5.0|Everyone puts this movie down because of one thing: not enough special FX.  But, take for example &quot;Mask of Zorro&quot;, that movie relied on about 5% FX.  This movie is a little better than &quot;Armageddon&quot;  because this movie cares more about the characters and what they go  throough in order to prepare for a worldwide disaster.  Very emotional and  full of drama, this movie is a must have for DVD because of the 5.1  Soundtrack and the x-tra features.
B00000DFRS|4.0|For all of those who don't think that this album is great, they're all full of it.  Whitney came through and alot of people expected her to come back with the sound of years past.  If the people who write in were true  fans, they should've been keeping up and they would know what kind of style  Whitney is coming back out with.  Mariah's a great singer but Whitney's my  girl.  Reviewer's say that  she shouldn't change her style but Ms. Carey  did the same, what about her.  Much love Mariah but I gotta keep it real,  both of you sound great.  Whitney came out blazin' especially with the  first  track.  She has great producers and who said that Whitney isn't an  R&amp;B artist?  She kept it tight to  death and with the changing times  she gets much respect from me.  Don't change a thing Whitney!
6305265488|4.0|I never really liked Drew Barrymore's work, but she really brings a fresh, 90's twist to a well-known tale. Instead of sitting around singing and crying about what she wants, she goes out and gets it by being strong,  assertive, and smart.  While some aspects were too 90's, the overall effect  was awesome!
1559408898|4.0|I truely enjoyed Robocop ... enough to want to add it to my &quot;classics collection&quot; of DVDs (including the Thing, Predator, and The Terminator) ... and I liked all the DVD add-ons ... like the storyboard etc  ... but I was dissappointed that this movie is NOT WIDESCREEN (my favorite  aspect ratio because of the theater like experience while viewing) It is,  instead, in a &quot;Director Approved 1.66:1 ratio&quot; ... similar to  most pan-and-scan movies.  It's still good, but it could have been better  in a 2.35:1 ratio ... much, much better.
0792151712|5.0|This is a wonderful movie!  I have seen it 5 times and I never get tired of it!  Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet really sparkle!  I couldn't imagine anyone else being in this film.  Everyone knows this movie is  great, it won BEST PICTURE, not to mention 10 other categories! This movie  really shines, and is a must-see, and a must-buy!  You can't go without  seeing this movie!  It is the best movie of all time!
0606005919|5.0|After being required to read this &quot;novel&quot; in a literature class, I sighed feeling the weight of this 600 page book burdening down my summer.   Once into the book, however, I wasn't able to put it down. This timeless  classic shows the American Dream of moving west to find a better life. The  parallel between the generations of Trasks and also the &quot;greatest  story ever told&quot; of Cain and Abel.  This story deals with a child's  greatest fear of not being loved and the means if forgiveness. Not just  your average novel, East of Eden is a story of life.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|This being the first offspring record I have bought has gotten me very interested in the band. I don't really see some of the songs as having much meaning but they keep me listening because of the fast beat and sudden  noises and phrases.I reccommend this cd to anybody who enjoys both comical  and serious alternative and metal music.
0380002930|3.0|This book, long as it is, is a good read for those who enjoy animal personifications in a metaphorical sense, however, I personally, did not enjoy it.  The plot, though well developed, took many chapters to reach a  climax.. so many chapters that interest was lost.  A book for some, but not  for everyone/
0316152196|5.0|JUST WHEN I THOUGHT MICHAEL CONNELLY COULDN'T GET ANY BETTER, HE PROVES ME WRONG.  THIS ONE IS THE BEST OF BOSCH.  TIGHT RAT HOLES, INDEED; CONNELLY KNOWS HOW TO KEEP US INTO THE PLOT UNTIL THE LAST PAGE.  IF YOU HAVEN'T MET  HARRY BOSCH, YOU ARE MOST CERTAINLY MISSING AN EVENT.  GO BACK TO THE BLACK  ECHO AND START WITH #1; YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU DID.  NOW THE PROBLEM IS HOW  LONG MUST WE GO BEFORE HARRY RETURNS?
0930289234|5.0|I just finished reading Watchmen for probably the seventh time. I have a few books I have read repeatedly (&quot;The World According to Garp&quot;, Updike's &quot;Rabbit Angstrom&quot; series, &quot;The Stand&quot;). I  revisit these stories because they touch some emotional chord. Watchmen  still resonates that chord. All good literature (for that is what it truly  is) challenges your perception of the world, and asks you to look at what  your belief system entails. Beyond that, Watchmen challenges you to ask why  YOU are the way YOU are today. The Dark Knight Returns has a similar feel,  but is more one-dimensional (Batman) contrasted with the multiple character  elements of Watchmen. If you enjoyed this book, there is an anime video  tape you would also find appealing, &quot;The Wings of Honnemaise&quot;.  It, too, will evoke that feeling that you had when you were  &quot;into&quot; the world of the Watchmen.
0790739909|5.0|This movie was incredible. It was ingenious and very artistic. I found it to be very romantic and I cried the whole movie. I have seen the Titanic also, and I do believe this movie was much better!! I would recommend this  movie to anyone.
6304913176|1.0|This film lacked a good plot. The special effects were good but without a an excellent story to go with it. I did not like the fact that Humans were the bad guys. I like to think Humans will be better in the future not  worst.
6304639457|5.0|Fleetwood Mac - The Dance               Reviewed by David Shattuck<br />    &quot;The Dance&quot; is a nostalgic bobsled ride into a great rock and roll reunion concert from two decades past filmed at Warner brothers  studios in Burbank California in front of  a very live concert audience. It  is well worth it for your spirit to spend the 106 minutes of life required  to experience it.      The concert starts from a stage resembling an alien  mothership which has just landed. Mick Fleetwood revs you up from the start  with his facial machinations. The man is really into his work and resembles  that mad scientist from &quot;Back to the Future&quot;. The video features  the multi talented Lindsey Buckingham on various guitars as you ride every  wave of blues agony and shouts that he can utter. Of course there is Stevie  Nicks with her unique voice reminding you of a softer Janice Joplin.         Throughout the video you feel like you are at a live concert and it flows  well. Christine McVie is a nice soprano compliment to Stevie and John McVie  plays a steady bass guitar which seems to be his major role.        Now  seems like a good time to unload some observations form the many numbers  featured on the video:       Christine performs her unique British rhythm  in &quot;Everywhere&quot; while Stevie plays the tambourine sauntering  across the stage. Many of the tunes feature themes of love and struggles of  life.       Stevie delivers her signature alto blues voice in &quot;Gold  Dust Woman&quot; and angelically harmonizes with Christine and Lindsey.         &quot;I'm so afraid&quot; features Lindsey  in some powerful hard rock  guitar runs and voice solos. You can feel his anguish and literally see the  sweat dripping down his face from those sizzling stage lights. He reminds  me of a slightly milder Jimmy Hendrix  but plays the electric guitar as if  it where an extension of his tormented soul  to a standing ovation.         Fleetwood Mac even plays a few new tunes(at least to me). Christine is  featured in &quot;Temporary One&quot; and Lindsey plays a 12 string  acoustic guitar in &quot;Bleed to Love Her&quot;. &quot;Sweet Girl&quot; is  yet another good new work.        Stevie captures time with  &quot;Gypsy&quot; and if you close your eyes you become magically  transported back to the 70s.         &quot;Big Love&quot; features a  spotlight solo by Lindsey on acoustic guitar. It is a hard driving blues  rock number that rips through your soul and carries you down a white water   journey on the river called agony. He follows with a soft blues ballad  called &quot;Go Insane&quot; which is about all that's left to do after  that river run!         Stevie dedicates &quot;Landslide&quot; to her Daddy  which is a beautiful poetic number and reminds you of something that should  be played at a graduation, wedding, or some other significant social event  of one's life. During this song there is plenty of eye and soul contact  between Stevie and Lindsey which culminates in a meaningful and long hug,  embrace, and kiss between the two. (Still waters still run deep). It was a  rare sight indeed to see these professionals raptured in the passion of the  moment.         There was a moment of humor when Christine states &quot;My  ex-husband actually sings&quot; in &quot;Say you love me&quot; to which  John replies &quot;If only mummy could see me now&quot;. She continues as  the lead in &quot;You make loving fun&quot; and scales the &quot;Do you  believe in miracles&quot; heights as only she could do.         A song  called &quot;My little demon&quot; did nothing for me and is simply filler  rock. The  chorus has a line &quot;I really don't like it&quot; which turns  out to be a prophetic statement.         &quot;Over my head&quot; is  another Christine lead ballad that just makes you &quot;sure feel  nice&quot;  and leads into the classic &quot;Rhiannon&quot;, a love  yearning ballad by Stevie loaded full of poetic similes and metaphors.          The highest energy on the video is achieved in &quot;Tusk&quot; where  Fleetwood Mac is joined on stage by the USC marching band for a grand  finale as the mothership turns into a brilliant white glow as if ready for  blast off.         &quot;The Dance' is appropriately named for that is  exactly what your body wants to do during and after experiencing it.
B000000OYN|3.0|Coverdale is at his absolute best (or worst) with his trademark stoopid and sexist lyrics on Saints and Sinners.  The band drives through a set of melodies that are aimed at simplicity and groovabilty.  Micky Moody is not  messing around with anything intricate here, as this is this most basic  batch of songs he's played on to date.  Even Jon Lord seems to have a who  cares, give 'er hell delivery here.  That said, this is one of my all time  favorite late-night, one-too-many-with- the-boys albums.  Don't expect a  light bulb to go off in your head after listening to this!
B000000WHX|2.0|After listening to &quot; Protection&quot; i believed all the hype about this one.Apart from the first song and a couple more,I find this album generally boring
1882723163|5.0|After reading this book, I cried myself to sleep. Nothing has touched me as profoundly as this book, and I hope that everyone who reads these words recieves as much from it as I have... To each his own, and my opinion  stands- The best novel I have ever read, or will read again.
0441172717|5.0|If a person were to conduct a poll, asking science fiction fans to name their 5 favorite books, Dune would almost surely appear in at least 80% of the lists.<br />Frank Herbert has created something remarkable, blending  several intricate subplots around the central tale of Paul Atreides to form  one of the most complex and riveting tales of all time.<br />The  Characterization is flawless and there are more ideas introduced in this  one book than I have seen in a dozen of the same genre. Its only drawback  or another novelity, depending on your opinion, its Herbert's writing  style. Some, like my sister found it very off putting to be immediately  thrust into the world with no proper explanation of terms such as the Bene  Gesserit, the melange. Many have not progressed beyond the first 30 pages  because of this, professing a sense of confusion. I however, find this to  be a refreshing change from tthe usual lengthy explanations, which lend  meat but no excitement to a novel.<br />Dune is a roller coaster ride of  thrills, exceptional in every way, and should be read by anyone, fans of  the genre or not. Wheter u love it or loath it you must admit that it is  something special.
0812550706|5.0|Rare for a book to consume all my attention cover to cover... this one does.  I have just purchased the sequential novel.
6300183513|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock uses everything possible to make this movie the awesome, suspensful movie it is.  Don't run away from this one just because it's a classic, it is better than most thrillers today.  Don't be miss-lead by the  1998 re-make.<br />James Stewart plays a wheelchair bound photographer,  suffering from a broken leg. Subsequently he takes up the interesting habit  of watching his neighbors through his &quot;rear window&quot;.  His  girlfriend, nurse, and old friend who is a detective, soon become involved,  when he suspects a salesman neighbor of murdering his own, invalid wife,  one night!
6304639457|5.0|I have personally appreciated the Mac for their great music, and after viewing this video, I am amazed at their beauty as well as their performance.  Stevie and Christine are lovely, and the men are handsome as  well.  When Stevie pauses and kisses Linday, the house was on their feet  applauding.  And the artisans on their keyboard, strings, and percussions  had me enthralled.  USC band joins for 2 songs and wow, what a blast that  was.  I say &quot;buy it&quot;!
0880381736|4.0|I received this book as a gift this past christmas, and I haven't been able to put it down. I have recently finished this novel and am moving on the second in the series of three. I found the character of Raistlin to be  the most intriguing, but I also loved the conflicts between Tasslehoff (a  kender theif), and Flint (a dwarf). At first, I was a bit reluctant to read  the novels, because I have always found the fantasy genre to be (Though a  huge fan of Dungeons and dragons)a bit hokey. but as soon as I opened it  up, I just couln't put it down. The pace of the book flows quite nicely,  and the two authors do a good job of creating a mood and a setting for this  world. It also touches on important issues, such as religion and war, and  I'm glad to see that a book can be set in medevil times and still touch on  today's issues. though the book was near perfect, nothing deserves five  stars in my eyes. historical inaccuracies and a sprinkling of that old time  hokeyness glare from the prose at various times (The Plainsman survives  after the dragon's attack at the cities ruins? Puh-leeze!), but even they  can't bring down this otherwise brilliant work.
B0000027F3|5.0|I never thought much about Judas Priest after hearing the song &quot;Breaking the Law.&quot;  However, after buying this album, I love their sound.  There isn't one track I dislike on this album, and I think  Halford's vocals are awesome, and the guitar work is phenomenal!  This flat  out rocks!
0670880728|4.0|I enjoyed this book but didn't find myself laughing out loud.  I found some of the British terms confusing; however, eventually figured out what the definitions were (too bad there wasn't a small glossary of terms in the  back for us non-Brits).  Overall it was entertaining and a quick read.
6303201962|5.0|Unanimously considered by most people as the best of all the Star Trek films.  This one does have it all:  excellent action, a good storyline, a good script, solid acting, and outstanding music by James Horner (he did  Glory, Aliens, and Braveheart).  Truly, without his music, some of the  battle sequences just wouldn't have carried the same weight.  Highly  enjoyable film that is riddled with tension and adrenaline throughout.
0345389409|5.0|This book really gave me an insight on heaven and hell.  Anne Rice really knows her stuff about religion. Alot of the book refers back to real events in the bible. I recommend this book to absoulutley everyone!
0767802659|5.0|Thinking of laying down your had-earned cash on a home theater system?  You've come to the right demo disk.  If the salesfloor salesman puts this on a DVD-based surround sound system, you're in for a treat!  This disk  will surround you with great color, spectacular special effects, and an  even soundtrack that really shows you what the speakers are capable of.   When it all synergizes pleasingly, buy  the system, and include this disk!   Never intended as brain food, Starship Troopers is a fast-paced,  bug-hunting, shoot-em-up, set in the distant future.  One of the best  sci-fi action flicks since Aliens, and a real must-have DVD for action  flick enthusiasts.
B000002HHB|5.0|Ahhhh...Where to begin? First I had the hardest time tracking down this Wonderful gem of a CD. I heard Wonder on the radio on a number of occasions, and like most stations today, the DJ never mentioned who the  artist was, OR the name of the song. After bugging everyone I knew, and  every record store clerk, finally someone could identify the artist and  song after a poorly whistled rendition of the chorus.<br />Anyway, what struck  me most about Natalie Merchant and drew me to her was the uncanny  resemblance of her voice and musical arrangements to one of my all-time  favorite female vocalists: Carly Simon. In fact, when I first heard Wonder,  I thought it was by Ms. Simon.<br />After buying her CD, I am in amazement and  awe of Natalie's talents. Even more than her hauntingly wonderful vocal  delivery, I was completely blown away by the fact that she wrote and  arranged all the songs herself (unless someone is not being credited).  <br />The arangements are somewhat sparse as far as number of intrumentation,  but the few instruments she actually makes use of, are woven together to  create a intricate and melodious tapestry of emotion and mood which  perfectly complements and enhances her unique folksy/rock  delivery.<br />Favorite songs? Please! Where do I start? I constantly play  this CD, and each time I play it, I find a new song to love, and something  about a song I already love, to make me love it even more. But if pressed I  would have to say Wonder, I May Know the World, Carnival, and Beloved wife  are my favorites.<br />If I appear to be gushing, I make no apologies. This is  the first CD of popular new music that I've bought in over a year.  Everything else I've bought, and I buy at least one CD a month, is  re-released music, so I am ecstatic that I've found a new artist whose  music I appreciate in it's entirety. Alanis Morrisette, has tempted me, but  she gets too eccentric at times.<br />So, as somewhat of an audiophile, I  recommend this CD with absolutely no reservations. I gurantee you will love  at least 7 or 8 of the 11 songs on the CD, and really, really like the  rest.<br />BUY IT!
6300214400|2.0|The first 45 minutes of this film are outstanding.  The fact that consequences from actions of a previous movie are seen is an unheralded breakthrough in moviemaking.  The pain and guilt that Kirk feels is  appropriate.  The best part of the film is when the crew steals the  Enterprise.  Frankly, you could make an entire movie out of just such a  topic.  James Horner's music (he also did Star Trek II) to this entire  sequence of events is outstanding and it really generates a lot of  excitement and tension as the crew desparately try and get the ship out of  space dock.  Once in space, though, the film starts to meander downwards.   The depiction of the Klingons doesn't invite too much fear out of you and  the dumb looking Klingon muppet-dog-pet, which elicits more chuckles than  ominousness, does not help matters at all.  The whole segment of the film  surrounding the Genesis planet isn't executed very well and the planetary  special effects are not very good, as the whole look and feel only confirms  that everything is taking place on a sound stage.  Indeed, except for  exterior shots of ships and associated explosions in space (including the  well-executed Enterprise desctruction sequence), the effects for the film  leave much to be desired (just look at the on-board computer screens for  the Excelsior.  Ugh, those graphics look like they came from an Atari 2600  game system).  The Vulcan mythos is executed much better in Star Trek IV,  with this film only giving you a few interesting insights.  The film could  have been a lot better, but it's still watchable, almost exclusively for  the first half, though, with things coming apart in the second half of the  film.
0385255853|5.0|Since first meeting Jamie and Claire in Outlander, they have become my favorite hero &amp; heroine of all time.  I have laughed and cried with them.  In this novel (and I am more than happy to learn another will be  coming) they find a new life in colonial America, a scant ten years before  the Revolution happens.   Claire and Jamie are challenged not only by the  vast wilderness of what will become America, but by the twenty year  seperation they have finally overcome.  There are still many things in  their respective pasts to be faced and triumphed over.  But love for each  other and for family can sustain them through anything.  It was wonderful  to spend time with the Frasers of Lallybroch once again and I look forward  to meeting them down the road!  I highly reccomend this (and the first 3  books) to any one with an interst in romance, history, Scotland or early  America!!
6305127220|5.0|This film is one of the best films I have ever seen. Elijah Wood was at his best despite him being one of the most underrated actors in recent memory. Robert Duvall also turned in another outstanding performance.  Tremendous acting, photography, special effects and plot made this  a real  science fiction hit. &quot;Deep Impact&quot; is about a large comet that  threatens to collide with earth and wipe out most of mankind. Check out the  end of this film. It's awesome!!<br />Cast: Elijah Wood, Robert Duvall, Tea  Leoni,      Vanessa Redgrave and Morgan Freeman. Directed by: Mimi Leder
B000002I97|5.0|I have been listening to this album for 20 years and the songs still captivate me. A truly great album.
6305128952|5.0|This is without question a beautiful, emotionally moving film. What surprises me about it is that it did so poorly at the theatre. People that don't connect with this movie must have a miserable, shallow, uncaring  outlook on life and probably hated Titanic as well.
0964385619|4.0|The author encourages the reader to go further in life financially by changing his or her way of thinking about money--how to spend it, how to make it.  The book is full of excellent personal experiences that the  author shares to show how it is done. Be prepared to be challenged to be a  better manager of your financial life!
6302820448|5.0|When I first saw that movie, I thought that I really had to get it on VHS. Since I got it, I've seen it many times and I always still think it's just great! I guess the fact that you can follow the way someone goes by trial  and error is the main attraction in that movie, that's what makes this  movie so great!
B000002TQV|5.0|On this one, we see Radiohead at their peak. Not even the &quot;rough-'n-tough-we're-rippin'-chords&quot; rock-star attitude of Pablo Honey or the cold, inhuman and mechanical sound collage of OK Computer  combined can amount to the emotional rollercoaster that is The Bends. The  whole disc provides a solid-rock perspective of everyday life and personal  pain. Thom, Ed, Jonny and Colin's guitars blast and attack your speakers  rather than linger around them like they did on OK Computer. And, despite  some rather strange song titles (&quot;My Iron Lung&quot;, &quot;The Fake  Plastic Trees&quot;), the lyrics make a lot more sense. (No  &quot;handshakes with carbon monoxide&quot; or &quot;crackle of  pigskin&quot; on this one). Thom screams, talks, whispers, hums and  sometimes even raps the (meaningful) words. I don't mean to put their other  albums down, those are great too, just in different ways.   My favorite  songs are Planet Telex (cool intro!), The Bends (same there), High and  Dry... geez, I love them all! If you're new to Radiohead, start with either  this or Pablo Honey, then reward yourself with OK Computer. Enjoy!
6305128952|3.0|I was anxious to see if Kristin Scott Thomas could  surpass herself in this movie after The English Patient, (which is my all time favourite movie), but to my humble opinion she did not, and probably  never will.
006091307X|5.0|OHMYGOD!!!  This book is hard to read because of the confusion, which I bet Pynchon intended.  The postmodern retro feeling is fun as well as the googy names.  If you hated the book, you probably hate analying symbolism.   It seemed laden with it to me, which ROCKED MY WORLD.it. Very symbolic of life in america.  What a fun web to tangle with!!!   Email me about it!!!

6302906636|4.0|Here's the original fantasy/swashbuckler starring Christopher Lambert as the immortal Scot with a French accent posing as an Antique dealer in New York by day and amputating heads by night. Forget those drossy sequels that  have more contradictions and paradoxes than Connor MacLeod has years and  check out the REAL Highlander adventure. There Can Be Only One.
B0000019HU|5.0|It's too bad that Slint recorded so little, because when they were on, they were on.  Spiderland has got everything: pensiveness, rage, complexity, simple beauty.  I love it.<br />On my radio show, I declared  &quot;Washer&quot; to be the best song ever written, then someone called up  and asked me if I had &quot;emotional problems.&quot;  I'm not sure what  that tells you about the album, but it says something, I'll bet.
B000002USP|3.0|My first introduction to PSB was their first (big) release &quot;Please,&quot; which I randomly picked from the record bin at the local public library. I loved that album. Those following were ok, with a  few great songs sprinkled throughout. This release continues in that  tradition. It is not as complete an album as that first one, and its  disjointedness is readily apparent. If you're a die-hard fan, you'll like  it, but for the rest of us, pass on and get &quot;Please&quot; if you don't  already have it.
6302824613|1.0|What a shame that Ian Fleming's best book is transformed into this, as they say in James Bond's Britain ... rubbish.  It's a spoof that has nothing to do with the novel, little to do with 007, and plenty to do with  a director who somehow produced an oyster of a film out of a pearl of a  book.<br />To all subsequent filmmakers who somehow swindle the rights to  classic Bond stories: If you don't have the talent to make a good spoof,  please sell the rights to somebody who does.<br />Mike Myers, for instance.
0425107469|5.0|Hope is the destination that we seek.  Love is the road that leads us to hope.  Courage is the motor that drives us.  We travel out of darkness into faith.                      --The Book of Counted  Sorrows<br />&quot;Watchers&quot; is definitely the best book Dean Koontz has  written.  The thing that got me (and probably everyone else as well) hooked  was, of course, Einstein.  As an animal lover this is one of my dreams --  to have a dog as intelligent as a human, and Dean Koontz has brought him to  life.  <br />But the thing that made the book (and all of his other novels)  completely believable is the depth of the characters.  You actually come to  know Travis Cornell and Nora Devon as real people, as friends.  Einstein  and his human counterparts are not merely figments of the author's  imagination, they are breathing beings with hopes, dreams, and fears.<br />The  Outsider is one of the most brilliant characters in the novel.  The  self-loathing and pure hatred the creature emminate are tangible, and  chills run the length of your spine when you read its final moments.  But  at the same time you pity it for being exactly what it is -- an outsider.   <br />An extremely good read, I would recommend it to everyone, period.
B00000G3PA|1.0|What a waste of Film stock! Why make a movie with a script worse than Batman &amp; Robin? This movie is an insult to the human brain, it lacks logic and intellegence. What's worse the bad acting or the direction? No  shots last longer than 20 seconds and each shot looks like a scene from a  Nike Commercial. I kept looking for that Nike &quot;swoosh&quot; or the  &quot;Army : Be All You Can Be&quot; title, but none of that stuff... just  bad film making at work.<br />Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this  film, stick to DEEP IMPACT, which may not be a great film but it's 10 times  better than this pile of $&amp;@#!<br />Buy this only if you are a fan of  explosions, bombs and bad acting. This film marks a new low for Hollywood.

0345350499|4.0|Having read Mists of Avalon, I felt immediately compelled, before completing it, to recommend it to several friends.  In hindsight, I can say that I still recognize it as a worthy book but one that still has flaws  that prevent it from being great in my opinion.<br />In the book's favor, the  idea of telling the legend from the women's point of view is fresh and  interesting... to a point.  I got tired of reading  about who was trying to  have a baby and give a son to a noble.  It helps to drive home the point of  how limited the woman's role was in some Christian lands but it still  grated. I wish Morgaine had spent more time away from the simpering  ladies-in-waiting and instead worked her magic and pulled the strings.  On  that note, Guinevere was the worst of the lot with her narrow minded  religious bigotry and got tiresome.<br />Some state the novel is historically  inaccurate.  Perhaps but Bradley weaves a spell that makes it seem real and  encompassing, a glamour as enchanting as any cast in the book.  I do wonder  if Christianity was unfairly portrayed in Mists but I didn't find it hard  to believe the priests would be so, at least some.  I do wish some had  showed more compassion.  Also, were there some dark elements of the druidic  religion glossed over?  <br />Plot is a bit erratic but it is to be expected  in the 50+ year span of the epic and it seems more organic and natural.   Any possible flaws I feel were made up with excellent writing and strong  characterization among the main characters though I feel some characters  were overused and more interesting ones, like Mordred and Taeslin, were  underused.  But these characters have been used extensively in other  re-tellings.  Regardless, I cared for the characters, their trials and  tribulations with the exception of the endless mooning of Morgaine and  Guinever for Lancelet.  Still, that is the power of love.<br />Those looking  for more traditional fantasy may wish to look elsewhere.  Magic is scarce  and little battle is scene, plotting behind the scenes replacing these  mainstays instead.  For the length, the books does get unwieldly at 870  pages and I felt many early pages contributed little or were redudant.  The  last book (Prisoner of the Oak tree) is astounding however and I felt it  could have gone on longer and I never would have regretted that.
6302649943|4.0|Compared to the book, this movie isn't very good.  However, we are not comparing it to the book.  The reason I gave it 4 out of 5 is because you can watch it over and over again.

1563523302|1.0|When I read this book, I was SO appalled at the POOR QUALITY of the research and conclusions that I wrote a letter to the authors. I sent it to them on 1 JUN, '98, in care of their publisher. I have YET to receive a  response. I reproduce the content of this letter below as a WARNING to  anyone who might be misled by the authors' SEEMINGLY &quot;scientific&quot;  analysis:---------I am writing to you about your research on &quot;the  wealthy&quot; reported in your recent book, The Millionaire Next Door.  I  believe that there are serious problems with your research methodology and  I would like to point out what I think they are and obtain your response.   First, and most importantly, there is the issue of how you choose to define  someones &quot;expected level of net worth.&quot;  You are careful to  state that you define &quot;expected net worth&quot; as [(current pre-tax  income*age)/10].As a former teacher of Philosophy of Science, measurement  theory and statistical methodology, I knew the moment I saw your  description of this measure exactly what your findings would be.  Your  measure asserts that people, at any stage of their lives, should have a net  worth equivalent to what they would get if they put aside 1/10th of their  current income for each year of their lives.  Why, I asked myself, does  this measure appear nonsensical?  Then I realized that it was because it is  biased in favor of calling people, in your terms, &quot;Prodigious  Accumulators of Wealth&quot; or &quot;PAWs&quot; if they leave school  early, take a job or go into business, get a salary which does not vary  much from year to year, and then engage in a regimen of self denial that  would make your average, everyday sort of miser look like a spendthrift by  comparison.  For such a person, there are few &quot;no-income&quot; or  &quot;low-income&quot; years (like those associated with going to school  for a long time) to have to make up for later.  In addition, there is  little likelihoodthat, when you interview them, these &quot;wealthy&quot;  individuals will have recently obtained a large raise due to, say, having  had an exceptionally high-scoring year (as professional Baseball or  Football players might) or developing a new drug to, e.g., fight cancer or  AIDS.Thus, many people who are &quot;PAWs&quot; by your measure are  decidedly NOT what most people think of when they are asked what it means  to be &quot;wealthy.&quot;  In particular, they get none of the benefits  that wealth is supposed to confer on its holders.  The main benefit of  wealth for such people seems to be the great pleasure that they take in the  sheer possession of money, itself!  This is thoroughly contrary to most  peoples' intuition regarding the actual meaning of the term  &quot;wealth.&quot;  Are people who love simply the possession of money  itself not just as pitiable as those who, with an enormous income, squander  it all (or nearly all) and, as a result, have a net worth near zero (by the  way, are there such people?).  More to the point, doesnt your measure, by  its very nature, fail to capture the theoretical concept of  &quot;wealth&quot; shared by most people (including most professional  Economists)?  I argue that it does and that, by selecting it, you have  RIGGED the outcome to paint a picture of the &quot;wealthy&quot; that may  not be accurate.My mother, for example, was a child of the Great  Depression,  she placed great value on the sheer possession of money.  This  was understandable given her abject fear of what might happen if there were  to be another Great Depression.  Over her lifetime she managed, having gone  to work as a teen-ager, on a rather small income, that didnt vary much  year-to-year, to put away an amazingly large amount of savings relative to  her income.  She was a &quot;PAW&quot; times 10.  BUT, the value she placed  on money per se was so irrationally high that she never, until long after  her retirement, permitted herself any ofthe comforts or advantages that  her money COULD have provided for her without doing any significant harm to  her accumulated &quot;stockpile&quot; of the stuff.Is THIS the kind of  behavior we want to encourage?  Miserliness?  Stinginess (&quot;I am my  favorite charity&quot; says your protoypical &quot;PAW&quot; on p. 11)?   Clearly, not even YOU really think so.  On p. 74 of your book you warn  AGAINST the very life-strategy stemming logically from your own measure -  dropping out young and going into business.  What kind of Economists ARE  you?  Do you not have enough faith in your own measures to do what they  tell you?  How do you think people would react if the inventors of modern  portfolio theory had said &quot;All the people whove done really well in  the market have followed this approach, but we dont encourage anyone to  try it&quot;?  This is nonsense!  Either you believe your research or you  dont.  If you dont even believe your own definition of what  &quot;wealth&quot; really is, how can you expect the rest of us to believe  it or to take seriously anything else you have to say?  The truth is that  what your measure has REALLY identified with its &quot;PAW&quot;  classification is NOT those who are &quot;wealthy&quot; but those who have  a masochistic love of self denial. Lets be HONEST and call them  &quot;Masochistic Self Deniers&quot; or &quot;MSDs&quot; for short.Now we  come to the second methodological problem with your work.  The fact is that  the tendency of your measure to identify  MSDs as &quot;wealthy&quot;  (through the trick of the &quot;PAW&quot; classification) is exacerbated by  your admitted focus on the &quot;first-generation rich.&quot;  The problem  here is that, unless one happens to BE Michael Jordan or Michael Eisner or  Peter Lynch, the ONLY way to obtain a net worth over $1 million in a single  lifetime is by being an &quot;MSD.&quot;Thus, again, you RIG the game.   Your own methodology pre-determines the outcome of your research.  The  &quot;seven factors&quot; you tout on pp 3-4 of your book are NOT the ONLY  way to &quot;wealth.&quot;  What they ARE is the only way to wealth on a  middle-class salary in one generation.  Ho-Hum.  Tell me something I didnt  know before I picked up your book.I am sorry to tell you this, but I must  conclude that your research is, at best, useless and, at worst, highly  misleading (in that, as you admit, it SEEMS to say that the road to  &quot;wealth&quot; runs through drop-out city and &quot;Drudge-job/Small  Business Gulch.&quot;).It may, however, be possible to salvage your work to  some extent and even, perhaps, arrive at some counter-intuitive findings.   This can be done by CORRECTING the measure to account for its obvious bias.   A simple way to do this would be to define &quot;expected net worth&quot;  as [(current pre-tax income*(age-21))/10].  This would reduce the advantage  the measure gives to young drop-outs who, for whatever reason, get steady,  low-paying jobs, and remove some of the penalty placed on those who go to  college.  A better correction would be to tailor the model to each  individual by defining &quot;expected wealth&quot; as                  N             [(SUM Wi)/N]               i=1where N is the number of years the  individual has been employed and W is the individuals wage or salary for  each year of the &quot;N&quot; years of their working life.  This approach  is clearly more complex and may require additional data.  BUT, it would  treat young drop-outs, Medical Doctors and, yes, even basketball players,  fairly.  In particular, it would not only remove the advantage your measure  gives to young dropouts, it would ALSO remove the penalty that your measure  places on those whose yearly incomes do not fall on a smooth curve. Would  these modifications change significantly your conclusions regarding the  Socio-Psychological correlates of wealth?  I dont know.  BUT, I suspect  that many more well-paid professionals who choose to enjoy some of their  incomes rather than live like Silas Marner, would be included in the ranks  of PAWs.  THIS will have the effect of significantly altering your findings  regarding the habits and beliefs of &quot;the wealthy.&quot;Another point.   You state, as another criterion for being a PAW, that one must have a  &quot;go-to-hell fund&quot; equivalent to at least ten years of ones  living expenses.  I would really like to know how you arrived at the figure  of ten years.  Why not seven, five or three?  How sensitive are your  Socio-Psychological findings to the choice of which number is used?Finally,  one last point.  You write (on p. 4) that you hope that your book will  stimulate others to &quot;learn how to develop&quot; in themselves the  qualities exhibited by &quot;the wealthy&quot; (i.e., by MSDs).  I find  that a very difficult sentiment to understand coming from an Economist.   Any REAL Economist would know that there is no way in which one can validly  assert that Mr. Xs values are &quot;better&quot; than Mr. Ys; that those  who gain greatest happiness from from counting the number of dollars they  have made at the end of each day while dressing and eating like beggars are  &quot;better&quot; or &quot;happier&quot; than those who gain greatest  happiness from owning a $2000 suit
0812550706|5.0|I read &quot;Ender's Game&quot; when I was only in 5th grade.  At the time, I was intrigued not be the characters but at the astonishing premise and gritty battle scenes.  Since then, I have taken the time to reread  &quot;Ender's Game&quot; several times over, and it gets better each time.   Card writes with a literacy that, while surpassed by a few unbelievable  writers this century, has found its niche in this book.  The characters are  compelling, the plot is compelling, and the vivid descriptions are...  compelling.  However, one addendum.  This being the first Card book I read,  he had me eating out of his hand.  Well, I bought the rest of the books in  his Ender series, one by one.  The sequel stinks, but I thought &quot;Ok,  he's just having an off year,&quot; and used this rationale to buy the  third and eventually the fourth book. However, the third and fourth books  stink and stink worse, respectively.  This is a great book, but the series  is like the Titanic:  Enjoy the luxury, but get out while you can or things  get cold and unenjoyable.

0679720200|5.0|When I shut Camus' &quot;The Stranger&quot;, my mind was hushed. It was a very odd book that made me think. Unsure of the books meaning, I read some of the reveiws here, and, slowly, and opinion began to form in my mind.    First off, Mersault, the narrator, is the most passive, static symbol I've  ever encountered in literature. The nearest analog would be Billy Pilgrim  from Vonnegut's &quot;Slaughter House Five&quot;, I suppose, but Mersault  is a different animal all together. His entire world is bloodless, and,  using modern brain theory, left hemispheric; lineal, rational. Yet, it is  this very bloodless existance that Camus is objecting to, at least in my  reading of the novel. Mersault is a slacker, neither good nor bad. He is  simply there. Sure, he's intelligent, but he's got no insight. He's caught  in a reality beyond his control, a material reality that never changes.  He's pleasent, interested in others, but unemotional and detatched. The  only thing he responds to are changes in his material organism; heat, low  blood sugar. That sort of thing.  In a way,  Mersault is no different from  the other characters in the novel caught in life's games. The judge and  lawyers, society at large, all seem to condem him, as easily as they'd have  accepted him if there hadn't been a murder.  Mersault's main problem is  that he does not move a finger to change his life. Like a pure Aristotle,  filled with cold scientific detatchment, he simply observes, never  interfering with a reality that has become a lifeless, bloodless, material  trap. Even though he sees the lawyers playing a game with his life that  could result in his death, he does nothing to stop it. We, who've seen the  murder through his eyes, understand that Mersault felt treatened by the  Arab and his knife. We know he did not pre-meditate the murder. Yet he  murdered. He did it coldly, but not in cold blood. Yet he doesn't make a  move, becomes a pawn in a pointless 'game' between the self-righteousmagistrate and the less talented defender. The question that troubled me  time and time again, and probably everyone else who's read the book, is  why? Why not take an impassioned stand? Why not inveigh against the  absurdity of reality, why not fight for life? Why be happy to be imprisoned  in society's little game of good versus evil? Why would Mersault not feel  sad during his mother's funeral? Mersault simply allows life to work on  him, observes what he sees coldly and accurately. His observations about  the foolishness of the law, the fact that even the most self-important  'doormen' in this life are still inmates, all ring true. He notices how  opposites fit together, yet depend on the other for their existance;  Salmano and his dog; the magistrate and the defense; good and bad. Remeber  how dejected Salamano felt after his dog, the cur he'd despised, was  lost...This strange, dialectic stasis holds the world together. In some  way, since Mersault is neutral, he is beyond it all, yet, like all men, is  caught in its web. In the end, he becomes serious about the game, and  secretly hopes that his  execution will be attended by a crowd of  spectators, howling in execration. In effect, what I feel Camus is trying  to do in the &quot;Stranger&quot; is much more involved than the reading  most others here have given the book. He's giving us a symbol of the limits  of rational, Aristotilean thought. Pure science has given us the bomb,  turned humans into machines. It has made western man maybe a little more  intelligent than the animalistic Raymond, but at the expense of depriving  him of a reality deeply alive, awash in blood and emotion. Our intelligence  has made us robots, unable to see the face of God in the stones that  imprison us, which the preist, probably the only truly passionate and  sympathetic character in the book, hopes that the listless Mersault, the  most modern of men, could see.

0804106304|3.0|The Joy Luck Club has many fine moments.  Several of the stories achieve a kind of wholeness in illustrating the characters' modern day struggles against the painful failures of the past.  Amy Tan crafts an interesting  structure that holds up well as a novel even though the plot itself is  advanced though interlocking stories.    Waverly Jong, for example, grows  up to become a Chinatown chess prodigy against the backdrop of her mother's  arrogant pride. It is a pride built on wanting her daughter to &quot;have  the best circumstances, the best characer, &quot;and realizing, slowly,  that she cannot will this to happen.&quot; Waverly gets written up as a  prodigy in Life magazine, then quits playing to spite her mother, then  attempts a return. Ultimately she fails.  When she quits for good at age  14, her mother never mentions it again. Clearly, there is failure on both  sides of this divide.  A hundred pages later,  Waverly's mother retells her  own story of first coming to America, shuffling through immigrant job ads  and ultimately landing in a Chinese cookie factory.  She suffers the death  of a son in America. On a trip back to China, she realizes she is no longer  100% Chinese. The natives can see this in her clothes and she can see it in  her own face. She has lost part of her Chinese-ness. &quot;What did I  lose?&quot; she wonders. &quot;What did I get back in return?&quot;  The  strengths of this novel are often undercut by Tan's reliance on proverbs  and folk tales. The mothers are most prodigious here, frequently retelling  stories of ancestral spirits, bad luck mysticism, and other sensations that  (we are told) only Chinese people can feel. Some of these references work,  many do not.  The Joy Luck Club is a novel of flashbacks and retold  history, but the strengths of this book are most consistently found in the  retelling of what really happened between mothers, daughters and collapsing  families. The allegories and proverbs take away from the characters. They  are too often used as a convenient cover to see through a situation. At its  best, Tan's writing excells in portraying simple events in a manner that  teases out the underlying conflict. At other times, the writing bogs down  with folkish tidbits.

My knowledge of India is extensive, so I did not suffer the feelings of not  knowing what was going on.  Mr. Seth took me to India in the 50s and  allowed me to take a look at what life may have been like back then.   Also  I believe it helps if you are linguistically able to speak another  language.  There are many  characters in this book and very few had English  names.  This book is not for  fluff readers.  If you are used to only bits  and snatches of a story then this is not for you.
6304083769|5.0|Never having seen an anime before, I was not expecting a lot from this video that a young friend of mine insisted I watch.  Within 5 minutes I was enthralled by both the story and the beautiful artwork.  A great way to  introduce someone to the genre.
B000002HJD|1.0|Jim Morrison happened to be a self-indulgent drug-addict occasionally making great pop music. As it was, a profetic look and an enormous consume of alcohol and drugs gave people the idea that this man had something very  important to say. The myth seriously reached heights when he, luckily, died  a poetic death in a tub (probably in a Jesus-on-the-cross-position, with  the hands hanging out).  Even that some parts of the music on this album  are OK, and even if one agrees that &quot;Jim's voice is just so  captivating&quot;, one can't survey the poetry which after all this album  is all about. And Jim's poetry is pretentious, pathetic, simple,  self-indulgent and dated in such a degree, that it embarrass the listener.  Recommended for early teenagers that hate their parents in a romantic  hippie-manner. <br />Instead of wasting time on Jim, check out THE DOORS.
0553278355|5.0|There is no melodrama, or pretentious rambling here.  Esther's story is touching, and certainly sad.  BUT she also makes some beautifully humorous comments on American society in the 50s.<br />This is a timeless classic, to  be cried and pored over by generations of readers.<br />Read it - you'll love  it!
0679457313|5.0|I forgot what it was like to see and think things as a child does.  TGST is terrific.   A tragic story with some characters that we like and some that we detest.   And isn't that how life is?  William Shakespeare himself  couldn't have told a more tragic story any better.
0897500482|5.0|This book is a great guide for marial artists to learn how to simplify techniques.  As a martial artist myself, I have found in the book a way, a filosophical, on how to make a simple short technique powerful and useful.   Of course, the book wasn't meant to teach, but rather to improve one's  ability.  The book helps, but you have to be active in a martial art system  with a trained professional because the book alone is not enough.  With the  knowledge that brings the book, it is necesary the practice.  The book  grabs the whole filosophy of matial arts and describes it in a way to make  you think about the technique, the form, and the results, to the point of  making it an art.  The book is a must have.
B000002BQK|5.0|The mix of Mariah's great voice and createivness in her song writing, makes the CD one of my favorites. I love it!!!!!
B00000DFSK|5.0|I have never been a big U2 fan, but this christmas when my older sister got me this I was suprised. but my older sisters intuition pegged me. I love this CD. It's mix of all of their various styles, and Well Done.<br />Buy  It!
B000003S0P|4.0|&quot;Red,&quot; &quot;One More Red Nightmare,&quot; and &quot;Starless&quot; are three of the best songs in King Crimson's history. John Wetton's vocals are clean yet piercing, Bill Bruford's drumming is  excellent, and Robert Fripp is just one of those classic guitar gods who  plays with such originality that he helped to transcend the way the damn  instrument is played. This album is probably the best showcase for the  band's talent during this particular lineup.
630512762X|4.0|One of the years most action packed films, anybody with a home cinema kit this is a must and an exceptional film to own if you have a laserdisc or dvd player. My speakers had a really good work out as there are some  excellent fighting scenes and the special effects are just phonomenal. The  story line is good but a little far fetched in places, If you liked con air  and the rock then this film is defintely for you.
B00000DHRX|5.0|Kudos for George! It's been awhile since we've been graced with a collection of hits from this artist. George wrote,produced,and sang all tracks to this CD. Well done and great listening......
B000002H97|5.0|The Metallica album known as the &quot;black album&quot; is the best I have ever bought.  Most of the time I don't find a CD with all great songs on it.  This CD contains exactly that.  Unforgiven is a classic whereas  Nothing Else Matters is the most emotionally filled song ever heard.  My  all-time favorite song Enter Sandman is a classic example of what Metallica  can do.  Like I said before, this album is great because it has not only  all good songs on it but great songs.
B00000DGUG|5.0|I wasn't expecting this album to live up to &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; standards, and after my first taste of the CD, I was pretty sure that it hadn't.  But after listening to the songs over and over...the amazingly  powerful and novel-like lyrics, the perfect instrumentation and structure  of each song...simply exquisite!  What also helped me appreciate the CD  even more was the knowledge that Alanis does everything almost  singlehandedly in her music.  She's not just a voice like so many artists  around today.  She writes them, she plays many of the instruments, she  produces them, she does her own background vocals.  These songs are like  her babies that she wants to raise on her own with help from nobody else.   I'm ranking this CD at the top of my list for 1998...just above Madonna's  &quot;Ray of Light.&quot;  If you are a true music fan, and you worshipped  Alanis's first US album, you will not be disappointed with  &quot;...Infatuation Junkie.&quot;  I promise.
B000003S09|5.0|All the makings of a great progressive rock group. The very stuff that made Emerson Lake &amp; Palmer, Yes, Rush, and Pink Floyd legends can be heard in King Crimson's first and best masterpiece. &quot;21st Century  Schizoid Man&quot; is a classic of progressive music, bursting with  elements of hard rock, jazz fusion, and a burst of science fiction.  &quot;In the Court of the crimson King&quot; is a great precursor to Lake's  future days in ELP, while &quot;I Talk to the Wind&quot; and  &quot;Epitaph&quot; add to the musical experience. This album bursts with  originality, complexity, quality, talent, and craftsmanship that is an  excellent testament to the days when music didn't suck! This album is a  classic and really should be heard by everybody at least once.
6304297912|1.0|Disgusting, repulsive, and absolutely disturbing stuff in this movie.  Feces, heroine, dead babys with twisted heads, swimming in sewers, what more needs to be said.  Warped and twisted and absolutely aweful!
6305074364|5.0|My mom and I watched it together, and we were screaming! It was so mysterious and thrilling, and it had a great plot. I've never seen a movie like this one!!
0446364495|1.0|I hesitantly add my own thoughts to the burgeoning chorus here, knowing that I'll be in the &quot;read all xxx reviews...&quot; section in a month or two, but I thought I might add a few things besides the polar &quot;I  loved it!&quot;/&quot;I hated it!&quot; reactions that are so common.   Granted, I despised this book; it is poorly written, with cardboard  characters and wooden dialogue, and its only virtue is its brevity.  Still,  while overwhelming popularity of this little trifle is perhaps testimony to  its utter banality, at the same time it must be connecting with all of  these readers _somehow_.  I am certainly willing to entertain the notion  that I am out of touch with the aesthetic senses of &gt;20 million readers;  whether you are one of those who are capable of being sucked in by this  book is therefore not something I can predict.  In any case, a thought  occurred to me during my reading:  the by-now well-known plot of this book  has an Iowa farm wife (and mother) meeting a traveling photographer and  &quot;free spirit&quot; and having her first and only passionate love  affair, only to end it when she chooses to stay with her family.  This is  the story that has millions in tears of romantic grief.  One wonders if  that would be the situation if the gender of the protagonists were  reversed--that is, an Iowa farmer meets a traveling female photographer and  experiences his first passionate love affair, but decides to stay with his  plain (and oblivious) wife.  Wouldn't the same readers who fawn over this  novel now think of the farmer as a philandering jerk?  Of the photographer  as a homewrecker?  Perhaps I'm just missing the timeless quality of  forbidden romance, or perhaps Mr. Waller just didn't do justice to his  characters, but that is exactly how I viewed Francesca Johnson and Robert  Kincaid.
6301562178|5.0|Well sometimes you just have to find humor even in a serious movie, and the Towering Inferno let's you do that.  The first time you see it you'll be struck by the engaging visual effects and complex, albeit cheezy,  storyline.  Check it out a second or third time for laughs and you'll enjoy  it in a completely different way, such as cheering on O.J. Simpson as a cat  saviour or becoming mystified as the fire seems to jump 30 floors for no  reason at all.  A dramatic winner and a comedic classic.
B000002C2E|5.0|This music got into my soul. If you've ever loved someone and it got screwed up, this is some sort of catharsis. It is unique either way. Spontaneously, it's the best CD I have. I mean I have over 600 CD'S , but  off the top of my head, this is the richest. Really beautiful. Love it.
6305177473|5.0|We can watch this movie over and over, and never get tired of it! Annie James and Hailey Parker were great. This Parent Trap is almost exactly like the old one, but more 90's. And it was neat how Vicki (from the old one)  was the fiance's mother!! Cool! This is a great movie for all ages, even my  grandmother likes it! Meridith Blake was an excellent villian for this  movie, and she is a great actress. Thank you for making another Parent  Trap! The English girls in Texas absolutely love it!!
B000002HHB|5.0|The only thing thatI can say is that this CD truly reached deep down inside me and made me feel agian! I especially love and ardently adore Beloved wife!  Merchant has true talent and something no other artist has  soul!
B000002HFU|2.0|Yo with this album EVERYONE owns it....but how many people actually listen to it?  First off that shows the albums worth.  You'll be looking through your friends CD collection and you'll always see that bright yellow CD that  gets NO stereo time.  Brooklyn Zoo was the joint when it came out..and  Shimmy Shimmy was cool.  The Production on this album doesn't compare with  the 36 chambers album or Meth's first one.  Bottom line this album has no  longevity...making it a mediocre album
B000003TAR|5.0|Not all of the best Nirvana songs are on the album of course, but the best album overall is definitely 'In Utero'. 'Nevermind' is good - but this CD rocks. I can't name my favorites because the whole album is my favorite. A  TRUE Nirvana fan should own this album. If they haven't heard it, they  don't know what they're missing. rating... A
0783225881|5.0|The final 32 minutes of this masterpiece reveal the soul of the movie -- the dialogue, the imagery, the haunting musical refrains. &quot;Maybe this is heaven.&quot;
0790739909|5.0|Not to mention whether this film is good or not, which is a matter of personal opinion, I'll talk about one of many messages the movies tries to deal with: It shows us how we forget to appreciate the little things that  life provides. We forget to enjoy and thank for a simple touch, a simple  breath, and these things which we forget to give the value they deserve,  and although we have more complex feelings, in the end they turn out to be  just the application of the simple ones to more complex situations, and  Nicholas Cage is so brilliant in this one, the way he sends all the  messages he has to only with the expression, the look, the mind, absolutely  brilliant, no one can miss.
0452277752|5.0|This is a wonderful book for anyone who likes suspense. Be ready to lose sleep reading chapter after chapter!
B00000DLUV|5.0|I have looked forward to this CD for a year. the stores in our area are not carrying this CD, and it is a &quot;tragedy&quot;. You are &quot;closer than close&quot; to the Bee Gee's music, atmosphere, and attitude with this  masterpiece.  I say to Barry, Robin, and Maurice, &quot;Don't stop with one  good meal; keep feeding your fans the meat from the top of the music  industry. WELL DONE!&quot;
080013799X|5.0|Ever since I saw this movie for the first time I loved it.  It is far funnier than any of the other Python movies, and far funnier than any other movie I have ever seen.  If you like British comedy you'll love it, if you  don't like British comedy you'll love it, if you have absolutely no sense  of humor at all you'll love it.
B00000DMJF|3.0|The Beatles could not have possibly topped &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart Club's Band.&quot;  &quot;The Beatles&quot; has some fine numbers--&quot;Julia,&quot; &quot;I Will,&quot; &quot;Rocky  Raccoon&quot;--but it also has self-indulgent studio noise experiments like  &quot;Revolution 9&quot; and the abhorrent &quot;Wild Honey Pie.&quot;  The  first disc is actually quite good, but &quot;The Beatles&quot; loses steam  on its second disc.
B000002J09|5.0|This CD contains some of breakthrough songs of hard rock, and the rest are some of Zep's best. With tracks such as the epic &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot; and the hard-rocking &quot;Black Dog,&quot; this is Zep's  crowning achievement, and worth every penny.
0440219078|1.0|The Giver while deffinately not a dry and boring book should not be included in the children's reading category. I have been doing an independent study on Newberry Award winning novels at my highschool and I  must say that I can not figure out how it was chosen when it does not fit  the criteria. The topics of suicide, murdering of children, and profanity  would scare any child!The adult book has been disguised as a child's and  should return to the proper placing.
0060977264|5.0|After reading &quot;The Alchimist&quot; I was so excited about Cuelho that I bought the rest of the books he's written.  Then I read &quot;The Fifth Mountain&quot; which didn't do anything for me, so I was hoping that when I  picked up &quot;By the River Piedra...&quot; I would not regret my  purchase.  Indeed, this is one of the most moving and lovly books I've read  in a long time.  There is so much to learn from what Cuelho has written,  but even more than learn, he offers practices that anyone can use in their  own lives to initiate the same changes that his characters go through.  A  must read!
0792151712|5.0|A majestic saga of love set on one of history's most tragic legacies, this movie is visually compelling.  The characters come to life as few other movies have accomplished, and you get pulled in until you feel the bite of  the North Atlantic sea yourself.  Brilliant performances by DiCaprio and  Winslet.  This movie revives your belief in love enduring...
6304467583|5.0|This set actually contains six videos, not five -- the sixth is a documentary made in 1990 containing several outtakes and behind-the-scenes footage from the three films (but especially I and III).  These outtakes  include the famous &quot;screen test&quot; for Brando (actually, a makeup  test), and the equally fascinating test by Robert DeNiro for the role of  Sonny.   The best, however, is the weaving of the three films into one  coherent and chronological whole.  Only one flashback is retained -- the  return of Vito (DeNiro) to Corleone to kill Don Ciccio.  But most  important, more than a half-hour of CRUCIAL footage is restored, especially  to Parts I and II.  They include several parts of James Caan's performance  as Sonny; a brilliant scene with the dying Consigliere, Genco Abbandando;  and two scenes from the early 1900s with the young Clemenza (Bruno Kirby).    The only thing possibly missing here -- widescreen presentation.  But the  quality of the missing footage, plus the extra sixth video, more than make  up for any deficiencies.
0393312836|5.0|My droogs this is one of the best works I have ever read, the usage of language is amazing...a must read!
B000002TQV|5.0|this album is along the lines of &quot;tommy&quot;, &quot;the dark side of the moon&quot;, and &quot;quadrophenia&quot; but so unbelievably better. It epitomizes the nuclear age and its coldness and isolation. You can rejoice  in its beautiful music or sink with its icy lyricism. Just buy it and love  it.
1573225517|5.0|It was recommended as a &quot;guy&quot; book.  It really is.  I read it cover to cover, then re-read it, then loaned it to my brother to read.
0060920084|1.0|Try as I might, I found this book neither witty nor real.  After the first chapter, one could only sumise Mr. Bryson to be a very unhappy person, and using writing as his tool for therapy. Every sentence of every chapter is  such a dreary and negative depiction of people and life in the States. My  only question... why did he choose to move back to the States?
6303965415|5.0|As a lifelong fan of the works of Austen I am always leary of film adaptations, for fear they are glorified costume pieces. This film was so remarkably well done, the characterizations complete and fleshed out, it  was as &quot;clinging&quot; as the book. It truly stays with you. Cirian  Hinds and Amanda Root are wonderful of course, but the rest of the cast is  just as ideal. I would recommend it to all but the most cynical non  romantics.
B000002NJS|1.0|Madonna is undoubtedly my favourite pop artist, but I didn't like this album at all. &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, &quot;Frozen&quot; and &quot;Power of Goodbye are decent, but most of the others are simply terrible. Where is  the energy, the exuberance, the sheer bubbliness and life evident in true  Madonna classics such as &quot;Like A Virgin&quot;, &quot;Material  Girl&quot;, &quot;Holiday&quot;, &quot;Cherish&quot;, etc.? By comparison,  most of the songs in &quot;Ray of Light&quot; seem lifeless,  computer-generated sounds. You don't really feel the urge to sing along  with the music. The lyrics are really terrible too. Madonna tries to be  introspective and spiritual, and ends up being simply boring. And anyway,  when I buy a pop album, I'm not looking for a deep spiritual experience -  I'm looking for some good fun with some good lively music. I feel that  there has been a steady decline in the standard of Madonna's music since  the early 80's. I realise that since she herself is getting old her music  can't always be full of youthful enthusiasm, but then she shouldn't try to  keep on singing. I'd like to believe that Madonna's next album (if there is  one) will be better, but I don't think it's likely. I hope she proves me  wrong.
6304539487|5.0|Ghost in the shell was an excellent movie with amazing animation. The creators really out did themselves by combining 3d pictures with 2d animation cells. The story has an interesting plot that has neat  characters.
0316152196|4.0|I have read all of Connellys' books, and Angels Flight lives up to expectations.The only distraction in the story is Harry's &quot;inner conflicts&quot; (I'll let you read for yourself).This &quot;story within  the story&quot; is awkward and upsets the pace.Avid fans of Connelly will  be forgiving, since the plot follows the usual Connelly twists and turns,  keeping the reader wanting more.

I've  made this review short and sweet because I don't want to give too much  away.  So check it out.
B000001FAC|5.0|My all-time favorite album by anybody, anytime.  I used to listen to some part of it everyday.  Pick a bass line, a vocal track, a dual guitar lead, whatever.  There is mastery in every component and yet these guys were so  young!  If I were stuck on a desert island, this would be the CD that I  would hope to have!  God bless the Allman Brothers.
0440211727|3.0|I don't care what they did to his daughter, it still isn't right to kill two people and get away with it. This book does not live up to its reputation at all. The movie is even worse.
B0000027D5|5.0|Recorded in July 1973 during a japanese tour,this captures SANTANA at their creative and dynamic highpoint.This live performance just burns.This was Santana at their most experimental period,recorded after the release of  Caravanserai and previewing some of the material from Welcome.The dual  keyboard work by Tom Coster and Richard Kermode is other wordly.I used to  own this as an import,as US release lagged behind about 20 years.No santana  collection should be without this discs.The sequence from Incident at  Neshabur to the end of the second CD is astounding
0440213525|2.0|After reading The Chamber I was eager to read The Client which I hoped would be just as good. I was wrong. There was no suspence intill the last 100 pages.
0790737973|3.0|This movie had many reviews but overall I thought it was very enjoyable.  I purchased it on DVD which gives you the ability to listen to Dustin Hoffman and the Director speak about each scene and since that time I have  watched it 3-4 times more.  The special effects are spectacular and the  plot is unique.  The movie has to be viewed more than once to get its full  effect and make you think about all the lines that the actors said and what  they meant, by the time you reach the end of the movie.  The second viewing  was more enjoyable than the first.
B000002LQR|5.0|Each song is brilliant, amazing and well orchastrated(spellng?). I have been listening to this album since it came out and I'm still in awe of its musicianship. A must for anyone with the love of music. A must for anyone  who ones a tape deck or cd player.
0553573403|5.0|Just read it for the 3rd time and it keeps getting better!!! If I could give it 10 stars I would. I just can't help gushing about it. All the wonderful subtleties make me want to weep.  I'm literally itching for A  Clash of Kings!
B000002AQQ|5.0|I'm 67 years old (female) and these are the songs that my daughters (4) grew up with.  Songs I chastized them about - and now, after seeing Forrest Gump - had to have the Soundtrack...and I love it.

6305212139|5.0|The Spice Girls have outdone their Istanbul effort and overcome the loss of Ginger in an amazing way!  A fantastic blend of show-stopping choreography, outrageous costumes and everything SPICE, this group will be  around for years to come.
B000002KOO|5.0|This, the original album by the original Fleetwood Mac is a classic of it's time period. The guitar work is incredible. If you enjoy 60's and 70's Rock this is a must for the purist. The lyrics are done very well and the  vocals compliment them. This album hooked me on Fleetwood Mac from the time  I first listened to it. If you determine this is a CD you would like to  purchase, I promise you will not be disappointed. The best way to listen to  it is with headphones and the volume turned way up.
0688062334|5.0|I love it esp. Calcifer and Wales, and Howl and Sophie and Michael. The body-swopping was a bit gross. I wish she'd write a third. (someone write me if she has, please!)
B000001OAA|1.0|You know how there's some CDs that just get better and better every time you listen to them? Well, this isn't one of them. I bought this album on the strength of its singles, and was very impressed with it on its first  listen. However, I have to give it a mixed review,because under the slick  surface, there isn't much that makes it worth listening to more than a few  times. The dance beats and heavy instrumentation are fun, but the lyrics  are distant and uninteresting.If you have plenty of disposable income, by  all means, buy this. But be forewarned that it will end up gathering dust  after a few months. I'd recommend investing in some artists with a little  more staying power instead.
0446364495|5.0|I love this book because the story was so fun and the characters were so alive. It made me intereted in exploring bridges and photography.
6305229449|5.0|As a teacher and a mother, I believe Mulan is the best Disney video and story for young girls.  Mulan is not a princess, but an ordinary girl that does extrordinary things.  My daughter was cheering and wanted to learn to  ride a horse, instead of wanting to marry a prince.  There is no kissing in  this film and only a hint of romance. Definitely kid friendly.
0792153367|5.0|The story of a glamorous girl who is trying to help her self along in the world.  She coems across her new neighbor, and they help each other through a series of laughable and sometimes sad adventures!  But all is well in the  end, with the most memorable ending of all time!
0783114222|5.0|This series shows what can happen when momentous events get serious treatment from talented people.  Sets the standard for docu-drama, and is worth owning so that your kids can benefit from seeing this chronical of  one of man's greatest engineering and spiritual achievements.  I learned  things I had no idea about when I lived through the times of the events.
6304708491|5.0|This DVD video is more than just a Beatles movie. The music is legendary and the video is a window into the 60's and into the roots of popular music, fashion etc. The plot is rather silly, but this video is a  collectors item. the plot doesn't matter. This is about the times, the  language, the humor, the personalities, etc.
B000002UDV|5.0|Creative playing. Sophisticated, introspective lyrics. Heavenly singing. Godlike melodies. And perhaps best of all, Brian uses Phil Spector-style craftsmanship on a record that actually *deserves* it, because every other  aspect of the record is that finely crafted. I swear, this is heaven in  recorded form. <br /> But it's not my favourite record. Sometimes I want a bit  of the other side in there too. _Pet Sounds_ doesn't really rock, there's  no guitar . . . but when you're in the mood, man . . . nothing beats it.
0780624890|5.0|Anyone who ever enjoyed a good action movie can't miss this one. Blade has a classic storyline of vampires that feed on humans when the sun goes down but has a more gritty urban feel to it. Wesley Snipes plays his role with  perfect comfort and is god-like on screen. The soundtrack is average with  two good techno songs; one of which is involed in the best scene of the  movie, the end (of course). I caution anyone who has a weak stomach to stay  away from this movie but for all the gorehounds I give this movie 5 stars.
B00000DGUG|4.0|After the rage that was Jagged Little Pill (which I can only listen to when I've got PMS), Infatuation Junkie is a great step forward for Alanis. She's still sharp and at times bashes others, but she's realized how to  deal with her anger and wants to share that with others. I am very glad  that I bought this CD. But if you're looking for Jagged Little Pill 2: The  Rage Continues, don't buy this CD. Alanis grew up.
1567407757|1.0|What I enjoyed most about the book is that it challenged me to identify its inconsistencies. I am an ardent celebrant of capitalism. I love all the wonderful discoveries and advancements our country has achieved. So, I find  one's whining about success uninteresting and immature. I am unsympathetic  with the collectivist culture of the sixties when our educators told us to  love everybody whether one deserved it or not. I disagree with their  substitution of equal opportunity for equal results. Contrary to the  sixties culture, I am proud to say that I am an elitist. The aphorisms are  so self-evident that I missed the book's point of making such an issue  about them. &quot;Age is not a competitive issue&quot;; &quot;Here is how  we ARE different than these wonderful plants and animals&quot;; &quot;If  you accept that you can die at any time&quot; to name just three. I am  heartened to read that Alain de Botton, the New York Times reviewer,  thought almost as little of the book's spiritualism as I do.
B00000AFWZ|5.0|For any baby boomer males who ever played in a band, dreamed they had played in a band, or wished they had just played some kind of musical instrument, this 4-CD set is for you. If you dug AM radio in the late  sixties, you'll know alot of this material.  I was in my pre-teens when all  of this music was released.  &quot;Nuggets&quot; brings back many wonderful  memories.  I own many of these songs on well-worn 45 rpm's long forgotten  about in this era of digital audio.  To have them made available again,  without the clicks, pops, skips and other audio deficiencies of vinyl  (often played on turntables with needles that stopped just short of  doubling as nails you'd buy in the hardware store), is simply astounding.   From the 100-page liner notes book to the discs themselves, whose top sides  each feature a parody of one of four different record labels instrumental  in the release of the music of this genre, this collection couldn't be much  more inclusive.  Although it is memorable to listen to all of the familiar  material again, the real joy of this collection is in reading about and  listening to the many songs of unknown acts, many of whom tried for that  one hit that would launch them to a career of stardom, yet only managed  marginal, regional success.  One example is a favorite rare gem of mine in  this set, Richard &amp; The Young Lions' &quot;Open Up Your Door.&quot;  A  one-time favorite song of mine when I was all of 10 years old, I was now  disappointed to read that the song barely dented the national charts (#99  in the Top 100!), and was only big in two or three midwestern cities.  Such  is the pleasure of reminiscing with this box set.  Indeed, many of these  bands lasted only a fortnight, with break-ups occurring for a variety of  reasons (i.e. musicians drafted into the Vietnam War, guys going away to  school, record execs replacing under-talented players with more talented  studio ones, etc.).  Sure, some of these songs really didn't deserve tobe  hits, but that just adds to the &quot;fun&quot; in listening to this box  set.  Extremely well-researched, the entire &quot;Nuggets&quot; package is  a stellar compilation.  Don't miss it!  Now, if only I could figure out the  lyrics to some of these songs...
B00000DFSK|5.0|Indeed &quot;The Sweetest Thing,&quot; U2 has FINALLY put out a greatest hit album. I recomend, however, that you pick up the limited edition.<br />The only disappointment is the cut-off songs, but it's understandable to a  quite lengthy CD. Bono and the boys are forgiven.<br />This is not the U2  &quot;before they sold out,&quot; though, and never listen to anyone who  says so. They always have, still are, and always will be a terrific band.  One can only hope that they release a &quot;Greatest Hits 1990-2000&quot.  Their songs all have amazing depth and meaning, one  just has to listen beyond the flashy music.<br />This album also bears an  unlisted bonus track, which I do not know the name of. It's a beautiful,  painfully short piano-ridden song, and is reason enough to buy the CD. I  highly recommend you do.
B000002UCQ|4.0|This is an absolutely great album and would have easily got 5 stars had it not been for the sound quality. Somebody at EMI has got to come to their senses and demand a remix.  I remember that my 8-track tape was clearer  than this cd.  Especially on the track &quot;Awaiting On You All.&quot;   The guitar was much clearer on the tape than this cd.What a pity.
0800141326|3.0|Godzilla was just another Sci-Fi thriller that gives you a rush, but had mediocre acting. It had an O.K. plot. The Soundtrack was better than the movie.
0345350472|5.0|There are glaring differences between the film, whose poster adorns the cover, and Dick's complex noir masterpiece. Dick's ability to join two seemingly unrelated genres, sci-fi and hard-boiled detective pulp writing,  only reinforces his pure talent. Dick writes with the raw narrative of  Hammett, the economic style of Hemingway, and the prophetic insight of  Welles. Though it can be argued in this era, Dick's greatness will surely,  and ironically, bleed over into the American Literary Canon of his, the  21st Century.
0792838637|4.0|Fast-paced with a good storyline.  Brosnan does a credible job as Bond.  But, the real story is in the audio and visual effects.  They are big! -- If you have surround sound and a good subwoofer, make sure you have you  seat belt fastened 10 minutes into the film.
0385486804|5.0|There seems to be an irresistable force that compels people to live up there in the wild and I don't know what it is. Maybe it is Jack London? The only complaint I have about the book is that it is hard to follow at the  beginning but gels rapidly towards the close. Think about it! How many of  your friends who seemed to have normal existences during high school  somehow took a strange path. Weird, huh?
0374172897|5.0|Cunningham's book swept me up  -- a wonderful read: as others have said, an homage to his mentor Woolf, and beautifully written on its own terms.
0671015206|5.0|There is a saying that \\"Simplicity is a Virtue.\\" I do not remember where I heard this saying but it would definitely apply to this book. Sometimes I feel that this is too conservative but more often than  not is right on the money. Above all, one must draw the line between being  too obsessive with money and spending money wisely.  Although money should NOT be wasted, money STILL cannot buy happiness!  Yes, if you read the \\"guidelines\\" appropriately, you CAN have your cake and eat it  too!
630516603X|5.0|If you thought Lord of the Dance couldn't be topped, you are in for a wonderful surprise.  Michael Flatley and his troupe have outdone themselves.   The entire production, from concept to execution, is superb.   The only thing wrong with this video is that there isn't enough of it, or  of Michael.  But there never is! This historic performance may never be  surpassed.  The electricity generated by the audience and by Michael's  obvious love for his production reaches out and grabs you.  Michael -  forever dancing in our hearts.
0385484518|5.0|I started to read this book and I must say that if Mitch Albom describes Morrie Schwartz in less than perfect detail, Morrie Schwartz is one wonderful human being! Yes, this book can be whimsical at times (Or it  feels like it is TOO GOOD to be true!) BUT it appears to be meant to be  read numerous times with each reading getting more powerful. A lot of  times we see Morrie Schwartz in everyday life and unfortunately we are  blind to his wisdom.  It is very sad he had to die with Lou Gerhig's  disease in the manner he did.  Ciao!
6304258984|5.0|&quot;The Rock&quot; is a non-stop thrillride.  The action is great and the plot is excellent as well.  I give Nick Cage 5 stars all by himself.  GREAT MOVIE, buy it today!
0800136586|5.0|Annie is a great movie! This is a story about the famous little red head orphan that captures the hearts of america!
0790739909|2.0|Leave it to Hollywood to take a good cast (Cage, Ryan, Franz) and an interesting concept (How does it feel to be an angel among us?) borrowed from an outstanding film (Wim Wenders's Wings of Desire) and make a mess of  it.  If they had stopped half an hour before the end, leaving the outcome  in doubt, the film would have been ok, but that last half-hour of soap  opera or melodrama, or overwrought junk would kill a better film than this.   Lilly Kilvert gets full marks for production design, and the actors  deserve credit for trying to put some life into this dreary tale, but in  the end we say thumbs down!
6302000823|5.0|paradiso must rate alongside jean de florette as one of the best foreign films of all time ( but watch the subtitled not the dubbed version). For acting and soundtrack as well as visual treats the film can only be  described in superlatives. Be warned however that after watching the  as-released version for so long the extra footage of the directors cut can  be disturbing especially the end - do we really need to know? Enjoy it  whatever your cinematic tastes.
B000002JOH|5.0|This CD has sold more then 1,000,000 copies.  It is a very good cd like all of their other cd's This CD is a great buy.
B000002KDB|5.0|This CD is realy a piece of sky.  Im delighted to have bougth it.  I feel a step ahead when I listen to it.
0767802659|5.0|The story may seem so-so to those who take it too seriously.  If you consider it an action-comedy, it is pretty good.  On the DVD, when you add in the special effects, it makes it a five star (must-have).
0060392584|5.0|All I can say is that, this as to be one of the most excited ,honest storys I've read since &quot;Boy George's, Take it like a man&quot;. I honestly only bought this book on the interest of &quot;whom&quot; Marilyn  Manson really was. I implaw you to all take a good look at yourselves after  reading this book, In my estemation this guy is a genius, yet no different  to the rest of us. ENJOY!!
6304145438|5.0|This captivating story captures the essence of Christmas that is easy to understand, easy to follow, and best of all, easy to fall in love with and watch time and time again.<br />It is the tale of one man's ambitions,  perceived failures, and eventual realizations that all human life is  important and affects others lives in irreversable ways. James Stewart is  marvelous, as it Capra in his directing.<br />I have started a family  tradition of watching this masterpeice every Christmas Eve, which is why I  recommend buying it rather than renting it every year.
B00000FCBC|5.0|EVERY SONG ON BOTH DISCS ARE WORTH LISTENING TO OVER AND OVER!! IT'S FAST, GREASY, HARD-HITTING, AND LOUD!!  WHAT MORE COULD YOU ASK FOR FROM A ROCK ALBUM?!  SURE TO PISS OFF THE KIND AND GENTLE LISTENER.
6303443214|4.0|Okay, I had just read the book, which I thought was pretty good, though not as good as most people had said (&quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot;, however, was great!) Anyhow, I think they really screwed up alot of things  (the absence of Lestat's father, casting Kirsten Dunst as Claudia, and  having Lestat instead of Armand turn Daniel into a vampire), but they  caught the atmosphere and I thought that Tom Cruise was really smooth as  Lestat de Lioncourt. Antonio Banderas wasn't good as Armand. For all of the  down sides, the ending (which was, of course, different from the book) made  up for it. Ohhh, that was great...
0151001820|5.0|The book cover says this book is the ideal &quot;beach book for the intellectual&quot;  and since I was going to the beach, I decided to give it a try. The book is wonderful.  Those who love literature and who like to  be intellectually stimulated should read this book as well as The Flanders  Panel.
0395389496|5.0|This is one of the books you'll bring out to read each and every Christmas.  It appeals to the child  in all of us.<br />Reading this book will help you keep the true spirit of Christmas in your heart.<br />May you  always hear the bell....
B00000DMJF|1.0|Wait until the master tapes are used with 24 bit mastering this cd adds nothing over the older CD version.  This is a major rip off in my opinion. I am sure this review will not be released because it might hurt sales, but  then I brought this CD with my money and I feel this needs to be known.  Write EMI/CAPITAL and demand better.<br />Phil
0553284347|5.0|This book is excellent. It provides a nice overview of parental chaotic characteristics, the behaviors that are the result of growing up in a chaotic household, compelling real life examples &amp; workable solutions.  I highly recommend this book over all the other suggested books.
6302038308|5.0|This is by far one of the classic must-see horror films. If you are a fan of the genre or are trying to get a better idea of how it should be done, you need to see this film. ED2, more of a remake than a sequel, pits the  reluctant hero Ash, played to perfection by Bruce Campbell, against the  book of the dead and the spirits brought to life by it. Truly a wonderful  mix of slapstick comedy and horror, ED2 is not to be missed.  And do  yourself a favor...see Evil Dead 1 and Army of Darkness while you're at it.  If you like this one, which you will, you will enjoy the other two as well.
630157401X|5.0|I must be blunt, this movie was great! Of course all the Indiana Jones movies were great, but this  one takes the cake. In this one,Indy must save his father from the Nazis. Indy's father is a Holy Grial fanatic and  together they must stop the Nazis from taking the Grail from its resting  place.
0553573403|4.0|I fell in love with Tolkien's world as a child, and since that time I have eagerly plunged into fantasy novels by most of the 'great names' in the genre, hoping to be captivated by the characters and escape into a  fantastical place equal to the likes of Moria or Herbert's Arrakis.<br /> It  has very seldom happened. Since now as an academic I spend most of my time  reading non-fiction with a highly critical eye, I find fiction of all kinds  harder to stomach, and story tellers such as Fiest and Donaldson who  appealed to me a few years ago on first read I would never bother with  again. With most fantasy books I usually end up quitting after the first  chapters or (more often) speed-reading the whole thing in a few hours and  throwing it away in disgust. The reasons? Fans of the genre know them all  too well: cliche characters and plots, sexism, racism, sloppy prose,  philological inconsistency, shallow history and culture, gratuitous magic  and (sometimes) sex, trite moralising, pathetic attempts at a kind of  saccharine pseudo-medievalism, a painful naivity about the realities of war  and wilderness, and, of course, the CHEESINESS of it all. Fantasy books  with their luridly painted covers and embarassing titles deserve their  reputation as fodder for children and geeks.<br />This laboured preamble is  just to show how good AGoT was to get the thumbs up from someone like me!!!  Although it was lent to me with the highest recommendations, I was not  surprised to find that the first 100-odd pages of Martin's book presented  the genre's typical (and perhaps unavoidable) range of things to moan  about, in addition to such a huge cast of one-line characters and shadowy  historical details that I didn't know where to begin trying to remember.  But it was the unexpected elements (eg stories of Bran, Daenerys)that kept  me reading out of curiosity, and before I knew it I was too involved with  the characters to put the book down. I read it in a day and a night and it  has been haunting me enough since that I had to tell someone about it!<br />Those who loved the unforgettable Eddard Stark might also enjoy the  character of Thorfinn in Dorothy Dunnett's historical novel 'King  Hereafter', which rivals AGoT in its characterization, wit, and complexity.  One of Martin's greatest triumphs is his use of young children as major  characters (so often the bane of the fantasy novel). He has Stephen King's  ability to play upon the horror of childlike irrationality and cruelty (the  wonderful Arryn jnr!)as well as creating children who are sympathetic  without being cute (Arya rocks!).<br />Don't expect neat resolutions and  happy endings in AGoT - you won't get them. This is a passionate,  gut-wrenching, tragic, and yet sometimes achingly beautiful story. I won't  soon forget the image of Tywin's army unfolding like a steel rose in the  dawn, or Robb Stark placing his sword on the table and saying &quot;this is  the only peace I have for the Lannisters.&quot; You want to cheer for him!  Other instances spring to mind but I don't want to write anything that  would give the plot away - its suprises are one of its greatest strengths.<br />Thank you Mr Martin for a truly wonderful experience - I only gave you  four stars instead of five because I'm still mad at you for what you did on  p.727! I am also thankful that I read this book in January 1999, only a  month before the release of the sequel. I pity the poor readers who got a  taste of this drug two years ago and have been waiting all this time for  another fix. If like me you don't like to read fantasy regularly, read this  book.  And if you do, consider saving George R. R. Martin for last -  afterwards, most everyone else is going to seem second rate.as been haunting me enough since that I had to tell someone about it!  <br />Those who loved the unforgettable Eddard Stark might also enjoy the  character of Thorfinn in Dorothy Dunnett's historical novel 'King  Hereafter', which rivals AGoT in its characterization, wit, and complexity.

B000002C1X|5.0|This album is the best Pink Floyd album I have, and i'm a pretty big fan. There are all kinds of hidden messages about war and life that Roger Waters put in. It is also just great music (Especialy the &quot;Another Brick in  the Wall&quot; songs) I would highly recommend this album.
0767816641|4.0|My kids loved it, they received it for Christmas, and have watched it over and over!
6305078564|5.0|This is a rare movie based on a book where the greatness of the book was guarded and preserved.  The acting and production are superb in their skill and faithfulness to the period.
079070546X|5.0|This is National Lampoon's all time greatest.  Chevy Chase did a fantastic job portraying who else but Clark Griswald.  This time, the Griswalds are trying to make the perfect Christmas holiday, when Clark's cousin (Randy  Quaide) showa up from out of town in his Winnebego with his wife, kids, and  dog Snot who has a sinus infection.  This is a great movie for the  holidays.  My favorite.
0792836634|5.0|I think this is one of the best horror movies ever made. For those who don't know the plot, it's about a murderer's soul in a friendly-looking doll, who kills people and obviously no one whould ever think he's guilty.  If you're a horror-movies fan, you can't miss this one.
0316286869|5.0|This book was the best book every. Its great for all kinds of people. Even pro's. Its writen by the worlds best makeup artiest who does makeup for all this book stars. Its great and at $20.97 for hardcover its a steel. I  recommend this book to everyone.
6300213803|5.0|All in all, this movie could have been the greatest Trek movie ever made.  If &quot;The Voyage Home&quot; hadn't been so fantastic, that is.  This movie looks great, sounds great, has fabulous character development, and a  sadistic villian. Unfortunatly, it is also very long and contains a  schmaltzy end sequence.  Otherwise, just great.
B000002UXZ|2.0|Do not get band of gypses. Hendrix must've been stoned out of his brain on this. The whole album sounds like schreeching tyres.
6305169187|5.0|Bruce Willis stars in this absolutley brilliant movie backed up by an all-star cast including Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Billy Bob Thorton, Steve Buscemi and Will Patton. Not only is this a suspense movie all the way but  you will laugh your head off too. I loved this movie because it takes a  bunch of nobodys, a bunch of regular joe's and has Nasa asks them to save  the world. This is such a wonderful movie and I recommend everyone to buy  this movie.You will wanna watch this movie 1000 times.
0399143904|1.0|The Hunt for Red October was a great read, and I probably can't expect Clancy to reach that height when he's expected to crank out a 700-page tome every twelve months.  But this was the worst product he's produced.  It  appears to be ready made for Hollywood.  Maybe he's tired of scriptwriters  butchering his product and has prepared a ready-for-Hollywood text, but  this is trite and preachy.  While trying to get into his characters' heads,  he has become an apologist for the Conservative Agenda.  This time the  enemy are enviromentalists.  If he keeps up with this trend, I expect Jack  Ryan to have an affair with an intern in the next book.  Well, maybe he can  get some good material from the Starr Report.
0684874350|4.0|McCourt potrays a sad yet sometimes humorous account of growing up poor in Ireland. This book paints an accurate picture of what Ireland was like and it's social problems;  alcoholism,  poverty, and an arrogant and repressive Church.
6300182770|5.0|Doesn't take a genius to understand that funding for movies always stands a better chance if it slams the latest challenge to the popcorn magnates of the big screen, and Videodrome was the first on that block -- for the  1980's me decade. James Woods excellent portrayal of a &quot;Gecko&quot;  character eight years before &quot;Wall Street&quot; defined the  materialistic &quot;me&quot; decade makes the story  precognicient and  provocative.  Yes there are icky special effects.  Yes it would have been  better shot in black and white, but you can fix that with a TV adjustment.   I have had the full screen laser disc for some time and everytime I feel  too happy I pull it (or Eraserhead) out to get psychologically pummeled.   For what little time you see her, it is also nice to see a 35 year old  Blondie in her prime.  This is one of those movies that fills a niche-buy  it to know you have it, but that's about it for the plusses.
0553269631|4.0|I always love delving into a well-written, even complex book and getting into the minds of the characters.  I was not bored or disappointed at all by this book.  It is a book that will appeal to those who feel caught  between &quot;irony and faith,&quot; or for people who are searching for  truth and something to give a lonely life fulfillment.
0780624890|5.0|This film is a smash and I would recommend anyone thinking about getting it or buying it to do just that, wonderful, fun maybe a little to violent for the younger kids but I have no ideal why it did not do so good at the  box office.
0385484518|5.0|I READ THIS BOOK IN ONE SITTING OVER THE THANKSGIVING HOLIDAY.  I AM A HUG FAN OF MITCH ALBOM AND WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO READING THIS PARTICULARLY SINCE I LOST MY FATHER IN JANUARY 1998. I WAS NOT  DISAPPOINTED.   THIS IS A TRULY BEAUTIFUL BOOK THAT PUTS WHAT IS IMPORTANT  ABOUT LIFE AND HOW WE LIVE IT IN PERSPECTIVE.  IT'S NOT A HUGE BOOK BUT  IT'S MESSAGE IS ENORMOUS!
6304645635|5.0|Tara  was excellent in her role as Mrs. Graham, although she appeared too harsh and deranged during some of the emotional scenes. Rupert was a totally charming brute and I savored every scene with hunkmeister Toby. The  scenery, the costumes, and the music was wonderful.   The film adaptation  was somewhat creative such as the manner in which Gilbert saves little  Arthur and the beating scene with the brother. The ending was entirely  different from the book and many characters were missing.   It didn't  matter.  I loved it anyway.
6302642175|5.0|For some reason, I passed up on seeing Tron as a kid and  only saw it for the first time last year. I must have seen it 10 times since.  It is one of my all time favorites at this point.  The animation has such style, and the  whole look of the film is so unique.  Jeff Bridges is wonderful as usual,  and contrary to the previous review, the actors do NOT look bored.  I don't  know where you got that from, perhaps &quot;You've Got Mail&quot; is more  your speed...
B000001EPB|5.0|The Lord of the Dance CD by Ronan Hardiman is one of the best CDs I have ever listened to.  I acquired this CD almost a year ago along with the video, and I still love LOTD.  It's not only the fast, constant tapping in  several of the scenes, it's also the rhythm and style of the music which  has the largest effect upon the audience.  Buy it if you don't already have  it!!!
1881273156|5.0|Dr. Gary Chapman has provided engaged and married couples with a wonderfully useful and clear way of discovering and communicating with each other about their most important needs. In fact, Dr. Chapman is helping us  realize the ways in which we experience love differently from person to  person. You may feel great love towards your partner but be expressing it  in a way he or she can't readily experience because their &quot;Love  Language&quot; is not the same. For example, I may buy wonderful gifts for  my wife to show how much I cherish her--the Love Language of Gift Giving--  and expect her to be deeply grateful. But it may be that it would mean far  more to her if I would simply take out the garbage since her love language  is &quot;Acts of service&quot;. If you want to experience quick improvement  in your ability to understand and fulfill needs in your relationship, read  The Five Love Languages. In this book, Dr. Chapman, who has effectively  counseled couples for many years, offers thorough descriptions of each love  language and how to successfully share them for a love-rich partnership. I  use this book as a must-read in counseling couples and at my  Love in  Action marriage retreats, always with positive response. Enjoy!
B00000G3PA|5.0|This movie had everything in it - a great plot, ungorgettable characters and pride of country. It was easily the best picture of the year. Unlike other disaster movies of the year, it left you with hope and the belief  that the human spirit can conquer the seemingly unconquerable. I wish a  sequel could be made, with the twin brother of Harry coming to life. In  this day of discouraging movies that paint a fatalistic picture of mankind  and survival, I would like to see more movies that build on the patriotic  spirit in most of us that is waiting to be freed.
0380002930|5.0|One summer when I was about 10, our local library sponsored a reading contest. 'Watership Down' was the first book on the list. Judging from this title, I figured it would be a boring story somewhat like Titanic. When I  found the book, I was surprised to find it a) so big and b) about rabbits??  Well, I read it 2 times, and bought a paperback copy a year later. I can  honestly say this is the best animal story I've ever read.
B00000ADG2|5.0|&quot;The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot; is the best CD I've heard in years. It is already considered a classic.  &quot;Miseducation&quot; is so deep you can't even describe it in a few words. This CD has everything.   Songs like &quot;Lost One&quot; and &quot;Super Star&quot; gives you a  taste of her untouchable rap skills.  While at the same time songs like  &quot;I used to Love Him&quot; and &quot;X Factor&quot; lets us feel her  words though her powerful singing. &quot;Miseducation&quot; is full of  hip-hop beats with a soulful R&amp;B feel.  Lauryn really went deep into  herself to make this album and you can definetly feel it when you hear it.  I must say the two most powerful songs on this project are &quot;Nothing  Even Matters&quot; (a duet with D'Angelo) and the title cut &quot;The  Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&quot;  These two songs are out of this world,  they way they are composed and sang, takes you to another world.  Every  song has a different meaning and feel and really &quot;educates&quot; us on  what an album SHOULD sound like
B000002HGD|3.0|This is a great example of Moby spreading himself out to thin; no particular style receives the attention it requires to manifest itself in a great song.  In short, the disc is uneven, lacking cohesion, not fully  ripe; yet, on the upside, if you suspend your critical nature for a moment,  it can be a fun listen.
0790737302|5.0|I love both Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan, so I was really looking forward to this movie. I have to say that Nicholas Cage as one the angels was perfectly cast - we were forced to like him immediately!  He was more human  than many humans - so we knew he'd take advantage of free will and fall.   Not seeing the original, I was genuinely surprised by the emotions this  evoked in me.

0767802659|3.0|A fantastic DVD in sound and picture. A very good way of showing off the format in a media room.<br />Unfortunately, the movie is a mindless media matter. It has only the most superficial resemblance to the Heinlein book,  which is far more a cerebral treatment of politics and the responsibilities  of citizenry. The DVD special section in fact shows a cut scene which had  more discussion about the Heinlein philosophy of citizenry.<br />This movie  owes more to the popular action/science fiction book &quot;Armor&quot;  (John Steakley -- look it up in Amazon, it's a good read) than the classic  &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;.
B000002H4Q|5.0|Even 10 years later, I find this disc to be an utterly amazing listen.  It's a masterpiece.  It's also the last Cure disc I've ever purchased...much to my chagrin.
0345389409|3.0|This book is a jumble of story elements that never come together to form a coherent novel.  The core of the book is an alternate presentation of Christian theology that might have made in interesting novel in its own  right, but that doesn't fit in as part of the Vampire Chronicles.  The  characterizations and theology presented seem inconsistent with previous  books in the series and there is no real plot.  The vampire connection  seems to be a marketing gimmick to draw in readers of Rice's most popular  series to a book that thay might not otherwise read.  Hardcore Rice fans  will of course want to read it, but fnas of just the Vampire Chronicles  won't miss anything by skipping it.
6305064679|5.0|Despite the attention given to the stripper motif, this movie is about life, desperation, and the evolution of friendship in the most unlikely ways. The cast are average joes in every way, yet as the viewer comes to  know them, each shines. It also paints a bull's eye on our obsession with  body image and strikes home with every line.<br />The Yorkshire slang and  dialect are hard to grasp at first, but you'll want to see this one again  and again.
6305171769|3.0|I thought the movie was okay.  But most of the time, the actors just had no common sense.  Like when the security guard walks out to see what was going on, what an IDIOT.  Also, when Curtis went after Michael, seriously  you would have been running your cheeks out of town.  The ending was THE  STUPIDEST thing I have ever seen out of any movie.  How retarded.  It was  supposed to be a suspence thriller, last time I checked that meant long and  KEEPING you on the edge of your seat, not getting you there so you can get  up to leave.
B000002BYD|3.0|When I first heard &quot;Given To Fly&quot; on my local modern rock station, I began to catch on to the song. Weeks later, the single &quot;Wishlist&quot; was a big smash. I decided I should buy this CD. After  getting it, it seemed to suck. Compared to Pearl Jam's &quot;Ten&quot;,  this album was like listening to N'SYNC. It made my head bleed. Here's a  tip, don't buy this CD, go watch MTV or something.
6305265496|5.0|I saw this movie the weekend it came out and it was one of the best I have ever seen.  It was so refreshing to see a leading lady that wasn't a victim.  She was a strong character who was in control of her destiny.  It  was a great movie that I strongly recommend.
6304118392|5.0|An amazing must see movie filled with what Americans want to see.  Binging, murdering, and a true love story.  A must see for all people especially Oliver Stone lovers like myself.  Like the graduate threw the  mind of Oliver Stone.
630512065X|4.0|A must-see for all cat lovers and a great introduction to theatre for children of all ages.  It was fun to look for my own cats personalities as each cat was introduced. Great music as always from Andrew Lloyd Weber.
6302238331|4.0|Been a long time since I saw this one, but it still holds up.  Fast astion and a great chase.  The older croud will know, love, and remember this one.  One of my favorites and very hard to find in the stores
B000002UJQ|5.0|I lost both the liner notes &amp; back inlay card to this tremendous CD.  I don't care, though, as long as I have the CD which I treasure on my shelf in it's blank jewel case.  This CD is better than Dark Side of the Moon,  better than Sgt. Pepper's, and the White Album.  A must-have
B00000G3PA|5.0|Bruce Willis was fantastic in this movie.  Not to many action movies that can make you cry!
0553275569|3.0|With all the hype over A Man In Full (and, having previously read Bonfire of the Vanities), I decided to read The Right Stuff over the Xmas holiday to check out Tom Wolfe's nonfiction work. I've always had a fascination  with the space program, and so was primed to read the story about its  origins in the U.S., about which I had known very little.<br />While I  enjoyed the book, however, I was left feeling vaguely unsatisfied. I think  the main problem stems from what Wolfe mentions in the Forward:  what he  set out to write about (the space program) was not exactly what he got  interested in (the test-flight program and its unique  &quot;fraternity&quot;). As a result there's an odd sense of disinterest in  the actual Mercury program--you can almost feel Wolfe's relief in the  last  chapter when he returns to Chuck Yeager and a particularly harrowing plane  flight. In one sense this works to the book's advantage, as it exposes what  I think is his main theme:  the great gulf between the tightly-controlled,  relatively underwhelming Mercury flights (compared to those in the  test-flight program), and the extraordinary national response to those  flights. However, to explore this theme better I wish Wolfe could have gone  into more depth on what was happening politically with the program. I also  wish he could have gone further forward in history so we could see how the  astronaut evolved from a fighter-jock to the more erudite scientist that we  today associate with NASA.<br />I did enjoy the book, overall, and I think it  provides a unique and non-jingoistic (at least less so than, say, the movie  Apollo 13 or the  miniseries From The Earth To The Moon) look at the early  U.S. space program. Just don't expect a completely satisfying experience.

0380778556|5.0|This page turning classic left me speechless! Du Maurier captures the true essence of a scared young girl only known throughout the novel as Mrs. DeWinter.  Without a family to turn to, Maxim DeWinter,a wealthy land owner  with a tainted past, proposes marriage and sweeps young &quot;Mrs.  DeWinter&quot; of her feet.  This page turner provides unexpected twists,  deceit, love and the transformation of an innocent naive girl to a  confident woman. This novel is truly worthy of one's time!
0156528207|5.0|This is a great book for all ages, it simply changed the way I look at a lot of things.  I will never be a &quot;mushroom&quot; again!  It is a book that one will read over and over again, I am sure one will get a very  different meaning out of it everytime depending on their life experience,  state of mind, etc.  Many thanks and may all of you enjoy the book  as much as I did if not more.  Cheers.
0790729644|5.0|Despite the cruel violence you can feel the dirt under your nails in the beginning. While it is hard to have much moral sympathy for Eastwood's character he is after all dealing with the ultimate bad guys. I have this  movie on VHS and Laser Disc and am now ordering it on DVD. I consider this  the Das BOOT of westerns
6303203345|5.0|Schwarzenegger is a ex-cop in this movie and has been arrested, because he hadn't killed a crowd of civilians, what is shown the way round. After his escape from prison he gets caught by people from TV game show called  Running Man. The only purpose of this show is to entertain the people and  they are doing this by sending some criminals in an arena without any  weapons. Then there are some hunters, who try to kill the criminals. The  criminals never won, but this time Arnold kills them and shows the public  the real video of his actions in the helicopter at the beginning and he's  free again. PERFECT!
6304288433|2.0|The first was a classic. Even Rodger &quot;I hate Horror&quot; Ebert had to admit it.  This is one you have to see if you're a fan of the series -- I mean you have to know what happened the rest of the night, right??  But  the execution of the film was pathetic.  The sharp sounds of the relentless  original score is changed to a farty synth version. And all in all, it is  just a generic blood fest.  I think the only true sequels to the Original  Halloween are this one, and the H20, but this is definately the weakest one  of the three.
B000003TAW|5.0|I absolutly love this cd. only in dreams is on of the sweetest songs ever.  My name is Jonas rules too.
6304140711|5.0|Fear is the best movie that I have ever seen. It is filled with entertainment and suprise. You are kept on the edge of your seat the entire movie. The beautiful actress Reese Witherspoon and the extemly attractive  actor Marky Mark make the movie that more enjoyable. I own two copies of  this movie just in case one were to be lost. I think that people of every  age are able to throughouly enjoy.My favorite song is also contained in  this movie. It is shared with my best friend Morgan, &quot;Wild Wild  Horses&quot;. I think that everyone should own a copy and I'd recommend  eating butterfly crackers and gummi octipi while watching this remarkable  film. All those smooth girls should also watch this film. It portrays the  side of every teen that most of us experience and it's a film that comforts  the wilder ones. I am extremly happy that I am able to write a review for  my favorite movie, Fear.
B000002UAU|5.0|When I first listened to this album, I sincerely thought that I hated it. It was just so *weird*! But I realized soon afterwards that this wasn't the reason that I was constantly playing it. Now, Sgt. Pepper is always listed  as one of my favorite albums, in comparison with the Beatles or the rest of  rock and roll.
B0000071J0|5.0|The real title of this LP is Felona e Sorona.  An outstanding concept album based on a Science-fiction story (Felona and Sorona are two totally different planets around the same star).  Great vocals by Aldo  Tagliapietra, effective keyboards and solid-state drumming make this LP one  of the best recorded by this trio.  A weird and fascinating mix of the  Italian vocal tradition and progressive rock.
0385484518|5.0|I had never heard of Morrie Schwartz, had never seen the Nightline segments, until I heard Mitch Albom talking on a Chicago radio program.  I was captivated, and had to read this book.  I purchased it, and promptly  sat down and read it.  I was not disappointed.  I have passed my copy on to  others, and will continue to do so.<br />Morrie was a wonderful man, and this  is a wonderful book.  Mitch Albom was so lucky to have Morrie in his life.
B000006Z8E|5.0|This LP proved beyond doubt that Italian prog bands could be much more than derivatives from the UK bands like Genesis, Gentle Giant or Yes. The Banco del Mutuo Soccorso (or Banco, as everybody here in Italy calls them)  was able to mix classical influences, electronic sound and astounding live  performances.  The gorgeous musical structures engineered by the musical  minds of the band, the Nocenzi brothers (keyboards) were the background for  the wonderful vocal performances of the singer, Di Giacomo, one of the  greatest Italian voices ever. In case you like prog music, have enjoyed the  likes of VDGG, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer etc. and wish to try something a  bit different, do try Darwin.
0780624890|4.0|Wesley Snipes plays Blade; Before Blade was born, (but still in his Mommy's tummy) his mother was bitten by a Vampire.  She dies as she's giving birth and Blade is given extraordinary powers.  He has all of the  strengths of a vampire with none of the weakness'.  He's called a day  walker.  His mission in life is to kill every vampire he can to avenge his  mothers death.  Kris Kristofferson plays Blade's mentor and helps him to  rid the world of all the blood suckers.  A cool story line with plenty of  action.  A must see for those who get into vampire type movies.
B00000AFWW|3.0|The first six or so songs rock in true Courtney Love fashion, but the rest of the CD kind of fizzles.
0784010919|5.0|I have se4en this movie like 50 times. i really enjoy it.  I also have the cd that has all the songs.  I am always renting it and i get frustrated when is checked out, so i decided to buy and see it everytime i want to.
0385493622|5.0|What a wonderful book.  Mr. Singh provides fascinating historical and mathematical context for this dramatic scientific saga.  Moreover, his relaxed but eloquent writing (presumably stemming from complete mastery of  his subject) makes an inherently  interesting story actually exciting.  A  comparison to works such as &quot;Microbe Hunters&quot; is unavoidable.   For anyone with even an iota of interest in math or science, this is a  &quot;Must Read.&quot;
6302969352|5.0|After watching &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot; and reading the reviews of this movie, I took a chance and purchased the video.  I was not disappointed!  This is recommended for anyone with an appreciation of a  fine work on film; while 3 1/2 hours long, each moment is put to good use  and this movie is far from the pretentious fluff that critics fawn over  that normal people don't buy.  This is good, solid and realistic!  I also  found it interesting to compare to the premise of &quot;A Bug's Life&quot;  (ants bullied by grasshoppers hire some 'warrior' bugs to protect them).   Anyway, a great movie but not like the Amazon.com synopsis reads - the  villagers don't become great warriors and the samurai don't become legends.   Anyone who thinks that needs to watch the movie again and get the point.
B000002BQK|3.0|I like Mariah Carey but this is probably not one of her better albums. I like &quot;The Beautiful Ones&quot; and Butterfly but the other songs were a little bit too kinky. She also really needs to put clothes on. I'm  ashamed to own that album! All in all, this was not a bad album but she  could do a lot better.
B000002L7J|4.0|Morrissey's voice and Johnny Marr's guitar save this album.  I first heard it several years ago and it does get better over time.  My personal favorite is Barbarism Begins at Home.
B000006OBQ|5.0|This is my favortite Sinatra album.  I started my collection with &quot;The Best of the Capitol Years&quot; and &quot;The Best of the Reprise Years&quot;.  This is the best of both worlds. It has all his early ones  like &quot;Come Fly With Me&quot; and &quot; I've Got You Under My  Skin&quot; and also some later ones like &quot;Luck Be a Lady&quot; and   &quot;My Kind of Town.&quot;  Also Count Basie and his orchestra are  wonderful with backing him up and Basie's great &quot;One O'Clock  Jump&quot; and &quot;Makin' Whoopee!&quot; are great additions.  These  songs are better than the studio recordings because Sinatra adds his own  charm and personality to each song.  The liner notes even snagged a Grammy  in 1966!
B00000BKDX|5.0|finally they put the whole album on cd, great sound and memory, a must for maiden fan
1559408758|4.0|Just about anybody reading this review has probably seen &quot;This is Spinal Tap&quot; as many times as the band has changed drummers.  What you really want to know is whether the DVD extras are worth the price.  YES.   Theatrical trailers about cheese rolling festivals, David St. Hubbins with  strait hair in an early short that eventually evolved into the film, Rob  Reiner begging people to show the movie in their theaters, deleted scenes  that develop and explain the cold sores the band keeps ending up with, and  the bloody demise of Janine (well, we can dream can't we?) all this and  more can be yours for the low low price of...whatever.  Anyway, if you're a  Tap fan and you've got a DVD player, get this disc.  If you're a Tap fan  and you've got this disc, get a DVD player.  If you're a Tap fan without  the disc or a DVD player, talk your rich buddy with all the cool home  theater equipment into buying this disc, then watch it at his place and eat  all the potato chips in the house.  If you're not a Tap fan, you can get a  copy of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; around here somewhere, I'm pretty  sure. I've always thought of Derrick Smalls as kind of a short hairy  version of Julie Andrews anyway.
086140324X|3.0|The Light Fantastic is much better. I love most of this book like heathen trob, but I find it hard to read because of all the inconsistancies with later books. I mean, come on, all that stuff about wizards not saying 8 and  by Soucery wizards are talking about eighth sons of eighth sons without a  care in the world. sigh. still, he is totally brillant to read and only  getting better.
B0000019PA|5.0|Nothing I have quite matches this album for its unusual and touching combination of popiness, unexpectedness, and even romance; the songs stay with me, haunt my unconscious mind, and fulfill some unseen, immaterial  place within. It's just a stunning bit of music, what's in this album.
0784011206|4.0|I think widescreen DVD will open some people eyes on a very good cinematography and acting (excluding Sly, who will be better playing numb people). DVD production is excelent (trivia game, director's commentary)  and video transfer is much better then expected for 15-year old movie.
B000002H70|5.0|Simply Put:THE CURE RULE LIKE GODS OVER THE ENTIRE MUSIC INDUSTRY AND EVERYONE IN THE INDUSTRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!                             PS---&quot;Disintegration&quot; is one of the best songs on this album.I  love you,Robert!
6302000823|5.0|Of all movie kisses none beats the one between Elena and Toto.  Just watch this gorgeous young man stand all year in front of her home waiting for her to return his affections only to have his dreams shattered with the close  of a window.... Not to give away any of the content leading to the infamous  scene, their kiss in the projection room of the Paradiso is a cinematic  masterpiece underscored by resplendent and moving soundtrack by Ennio  Morricone.  Be sure to watch the final credits--the montage reveals more  than one suspects (last three montage scenes).
6305263248|4.0|A Great movie, with oscar-winning performance by R. DeNiro.  Ronin will make you scratch your head with its 'killer' suspense, and its non-stop action.  Driving sequence is one of the best in recent times.  Highly  Recommended to all action moviegoers and DeNiro Fans!!!
0553296981|5.0|Her diary was Anne Frank's most intimate friend: she called it Kitty, and there was nothing she did not dare to write into it. Anne wrote in a detailed, lively way. For Anne, writing this diary was more than just  taking notes ,it helped her coping with the natural problems of a maturing  girl: her own &quot;split&quot; personality,  her relationship with her  parents and other people, her sexuality. Above all,  this diary helped her  to survive during the two years of hiding. She expressed her fears, her  depressions, her hopes, and by this, regained strength and optimism.  Moreover, Anne's reports tells us what she and her family knew about the  terrible fate of the Jewish people and about the political situation. It  may be astonishing how well informed they were, even in their Secret  Annexe! She also described the courage and devotion of the people who tried  to save their  lives. Therefore, Anne's diary reminds us of all the people  who suffered under Nazi-Deutschland, and of all the encouraged people that  dared to resist. It is an invaluable historic document, the story of the  personal fate of a young girl and her family, which touches everyone who  reads it. Therefore it helps to remember one of the darkest moments in  human history, and it makes us aware of our responsibility to prevent such  a terror happen again.
6305127697|4.0|A little on the gory side, but really a great action flick. The ending is unexpected and leaves a little bit hanging, possible sequel material. Gere does an excellent job playing a high-priced defense attorney.
B000002C4J|5.0|As was expected, this is a wonderful collection of  musical variety.  Celine's remarkable voice and range rank her among the world's best.  Dion/Streisand combo provokes tears each time I listen to it.  Why didn't  it become a bigger hit? Keep singing, Celine.  It's a rare and true gift.
B000002G7E|4.0|I'd give this album five stars, but I grow weary of the spoken number, &quot;The Gift.&quot; But for the most part, this is a work of genuine inspirtation. V.U. simply set up microphones any old place in the room (or  out of it, for all we know) and played their hearts out in a tornado of  sound. Exciting experiment indeed.
0767816641|5.0|I bought and watched Madeline with my grandsons ages 8 and 5. I was surprised they wanted to buy the video. I was also surprised they found it so interesting being of the opposite sex. They loved the clever antics of  these girls.  The story is fun, and wholesome with good value lessons  learned. They have since watched it several times.
B000002C1X|4.0|Roger Waters' attempt to combine a ponderous concept with a sort of Beatles White Album double-set mystique contains a few justifiably classic songs, particularly &quot;Mother.&quot; But for the most part Pink Floyd is  boring, no matter how carefully executed their concepts. It's dark, as we  might expect, but then albums for high school students often are.
6300183513|5.0|Stewart sees what he thinks is a murder from his apartment window as he is recovering from a leg injury.  The suspense develops as he tries to figure out if the murder actually took place.  Raymond Burr is the bad guy.  No  one believes Stewart.  Grace Kelley, his girlfriend, finally thinks he is  on to something.  Also, a great appearance by the pet dog, possibly digging  up evidence!  This is one of the best Hitchcock movies ever.
B000002UAF|5.0|Lennon and McCartney lay their claim to greatness as the Beatles power their way through this upbeat collection of originals. The chords, the energy, the harmonies... this is great rock, great pop, pure and simple  (though surprisingly complex if you look closely.)
B000001DTM|5.0|In 1991, U2 answered the critic's rants and gripes about 1988's &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; with a full-blown sonic assalt.This, In the form of the holy grail of rock and roll albums, &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;. With  &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;, Bono and the boys firmly established themselves  as rock's formost creative sound. Though &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; showed  their forever chart success with sweeping, ambient guitar baited singles  and elequent ballads, it also raised a question as to wheather they could  do any better. &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; was a great, experimentle record  in it's own way, it's dabbing at American music (something U2 had resisted  in the past) resulted in a much underappreciated effort. But with  &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; the music had taken a totally new turn. In many  ways a tounge-in-cheek recording, Bono once described it as the sound of  four men chopping down the &quot;Joshua tree&quot;. The scapes of the songs  are dark, brash, and very suttle, but not without light points. Singles  like &quot;The Fly&quot; and &quot;One&quot; are quite chilling, yet very  smooth despite their newfound ambience, and dance and reggea flavored  &quot;Even Better Than the Real Thing&quot; and &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot;  showed a side of U2 no one had seen before. &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; is one  of those albums that comes around every ten years or so, showing what was  capable from a band who dared push the limits of their own creative forces.  There is a lot of great ones out there, but &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; stands  above them all.
B000002I25|4.0|The Doors were a good band with a fairly unique, if thin, sound. They combined many musical styles and elements, but Jim Morisson was merely a competent lyricist without a very good singing voice. This is their best  album, with hits &quot;Break on Through&quot; and &quot;Light My  Fire,&quot; plus that funny Kurt Weil number. &quot;The End&quot; is an  overblown superfluity.
0688158234|5.0|This book grabbed me from the first page, and I could not put it down!  This is the best NON-Fiction book that I have ever read!  Her story moved me with the vivid images of growing up in a Somalian desert, and the  torture that innocent little girls have to endure through female genital  mutilation.  We can all gain from Waris Dirie's incredible strength and her  tremendous will to live, in order to make a better life for herself, and  her family.  I plan to share this book with my family and friends.
0609603086|2.0|Having lived in both Northern California and South Texas, and an avid Follet reader I take exception to errors with the description of South Texas. I could have read the beginning of Hammer of Eden and helped with  the editing for accuracy.<br />For the record, I have only read about half of  the book.<br />I have witnessed the seismic vibrator in South Texas, the  description of the operation is accurate.<br />South Texas is not dry (no  beer). It is unlikely that the local beer joint in Shiloh would be dry. The  dry areas in Texas are around Dallas, West Texas (Lubbock) and East Texas  (Tyler).<br />Looking up Shiloh Texas on the Texas map, there are a few  references, none of which fit with the trip through San Antonio.<br />The  seismic vibrator is a wide load type of vehicle and would require escort to  be moved. I cannot imagine it being driven by from Texas to California  without being stopped by the Highway Patrol.<br />Again with the seismic  vibrator, it could not be reasonably be driven through San Antonio. And  Priest stopped for directions. (laugh)
0790739909|4.0|I loved this movie.  I let the sunroof on my car open more after I saw it in the theaters.  The black trenchcoats are a really nice touch, and I liked the ambiguity about god---it never becomes a preachy film.   Predicable and not very deep, but emotional all the same.
B00000DGUG|5.0|Alright I've seen some bad reviews here, and should I have gotten online after I myself bought this cd, I would have posted one myself. There were choice songs on here that are obviously good, including Front Row, That I  Would Be Good, and Unsent.  At first I thought &quot;What is this GARBAGE  between these good songs!&quot; <br />BUT, after a few listens, and reading  the lyrics, they really grow on you!! Alanis is NOT the greatest  songwriter.. Using phrases like &quot;Thank U&quot; over and over.. and  &quot;That I would be good&quot; over and over.. It just isnt original. But  a song like &quot;I Was Hoping&quot; is incredibly fast paced in which she  recounts a story. No repetition.. Very unlike anything Ive heard! <br />If  you're an Alanis fan, buy this cd and give it a few listens through! <br />If  you're new to Alanis, buy Jagged Little Pill first.
B000000WZ4|5.0|Even after a near break-up and drug problems, DM have come together for a brillant album.  Martin Gore proves again that he is one of the best songwriters in music today.  Songs like &quot;Home,&quot; &quot;Sister of  Night&quot; highlight his talent for composing songs with numerous images  and meanings.  Accompanying Gore's compelling lyrics is the masterful  singing of Dave Gahan.  His voice has never sounded better.  His voice is  the ideal vehicle for the powerful lyrics.  DM have come through tough  times to bring another great album and another reason why they remain a  reckoning force in music today and tomorrow.
B00000DMJF|5.0|Sound is even better with the new remastering-it is nice to se the original packaging &amp; numbering scheme.
0670880728|5.0|I am quite a fan of tbe book, Bridget Jones!! I can totally relate to Bridget because I was in the same game for a long time.  I am 35 years and recently married(1year 2months)- when I am reading about the way she feels  when she is with married people always asking her how her love life is, I  crack up because that's exactly how it is!! I also know what it's like  trying to get a guy and discussing everything with my friends!(those were  always fun times!!)  It was such a fun book that I am reading it for the  2nd time in less than 6 months (my book club is reviewing it this week).  I  find that even though I read it before I am getting as many laughs and joy  out of it as i did the first time!!  I hope there is a sequel!!
6302968135|5.0|This film had got to be the best film made about life in the inner city, and the problems our youth face.  Damian Chapas gives an outstanding performance as Miklo, as does Benjiman Bratt, and Jessee Borrego.  The only  problem I had with this film, is that it delt almost exclusivly with  Chapas's character, and it left out the trials and tribulations of the  other two &quot;homies&quot; as they rose out of the barrio.  Still, I have  to give it an A+ for sheer ambition.  Hackford gives us an effective film,  and many thnaks to the studio, for finaly letting such an important film  come to be.
6303269869|5.0|The movie is about an alcoholic, Meg Ryan, her struggle with her disease, and the impact it has on her family. It is beautiful because as the movie progresses, you see Meg Ryan's character goes through personal growth, and   her family grows with her in an effort to support her rehabilitation.  It  is a serious drama that will bring tears to your eyes.
B000002JS8|5.0|this is a good cd.  One of my friends let me hear it.  High way to hell is one of my favorite cd's.
0345428056|4.0|I picked up this book in the Sydney airport while on a business trip (I'm shocked as to why this hasn't been released in the States?).  I loved it, I couldn't put it down for two reasons.  First is because I had nothing else  to read on my 14 hour flight back to LAX and the other was because it was  an excellent story.  I found the first person narrative a refreshing  change. I have read \\"Immediate Action\\" and \\"Bravo Two Zero\\" both excellent  in my opinion.  As I read this book a sat and wondered how much of this  stuff really happen to Andy McNab.<br />All I can say to Andy is... I WANT  MORE!
B000002MZ9|5.0|This cd has all the right parts. A little Jam, a little grunge (from the masters: Pearl Jam) and a lot of rock. Neil Young fits in perfectly with Pearl Jam members. &quot;Act of Love&quot; is the best song on the almum  and one of my favorites. &quot;Truth be Known&quot; is also a great song  because like all Neil Young songs they tell such a great story. I  definitely reccomend it if you are a Neil Young  or  Pearl Jam fan.
038097617X|5.0|This book is one of the best, no, THE best, I have ever read.  I laughed out loud and finished the book in one day because I couldn't stop reading it!  I was disappointed as other readers were when it was over.  I would  love a sequel!!  I have already accessed Amazon.Co.UK to order Keyes' other  books that aren't available in the US yet.  Do yourself a favor and read  this great book.
6303269869|4.0|This movie is very well written, and has a very definate plot which pulls on your emotions.  I reccomend this video to anyone, especially those who could relate to the struggle of alchoholism.  Good for ages 10 and up
0684874350|5.0|Read slowly or ration the daily page consumption so the book doesn't end so soon.  I purchased the book after hearing an NPR interview.  I loved hearing McCourt relate stories of his childhood and wanted to experience  more of his story-telling style.  Glad I did!  Angel on the 7th step is an  enduring image.  Having been in areas, years ago, similar to McCourt's  Limerick, I found the grimness and perserverence very believable.  His  stories caused me to share some childhood reminiscenses of my own(however  not so dour) with my children.  If a book can generate conversations  exploring one's personal history with those who can carry it forward - good  work!  I look forward to the next edition of the McCourt family.
B000001DTM|5.0|It's hard to even summarize my feelings on an album like this. I am too loyal a U2 fan to have an absolute favorite album, but I'd be hard pressed to live without Achtung Baby. Every song is incredibly dense, and it never  fails to amaze me how deep an album about superficiality can be. Some of  Bono's best lyrics are here, as well as seriously kick-a** guitar work from  the Edge. I bought this album four years ago and it has held a permanent  spot in my CD player ever since. Everyone should own this CD, it is one of  the few that will make you think just as much as it will make you dance.
B000005Z0G|3.0|not one of his best, but i get around and keep ya head up are good songs.  2pac blasts dan quale on this cd after he attcked tupacs debut cd. a good cd for all tupac fans
6303022901|5.0|This movie is a beautiful gem of a film. Great cinematography, fascinating and heart-wrenching storyline, compelling characters...Should have been nominated for Academy Awards...Ming-Na Wen is great.
0698115635|5.0|My Daughter and I love this book.  It helps her remember the days of the week.  We giggle and laugh and sing out the words.  I highly recommend this book for any child just learning to read.
6305232660|5.0|While Armageddon is big, bright, boomy and 'awful purty&quot;, a true Hollywood MOOVIE, Deep Impact is a film about people. Does anyone here actually believe a little space all-terrain vehicle-thingy on an asteroid  could do an Evel Knievel jump?! Jeez the banking turns that the &quot;space  shuttles&quot; made made me wince. 10th grade science class? Hello...<br />On  the other hand, WHAT IF...just WHAT IF a comet was actually heading this  way. What would we do? What would I do? What would a ship actually fly like  in space? That's Deep Impact. Instead of the &quot;YeeHaw!&quot; that is  Armageddon.<br />Take your pick...I'll pick both, but for different reasons.
B000001Y16|4.0|this was released days after pacs death.  makaveli was gotten from an ancient philosopher who faked his death.  it makes you think, and tupac offers up some things that may make you believe he isnt dead.  i personally  am not sure what to believe, but i do know that this is a good cd.  he  works with the outlawz on this cd alot.  hail mary blows it up.
0800130936|5.0|If you like comedy and action you WILL love Bad Boys......
6305169187|1.0|This film had to be the worst film that ever was released on video. It was absolutely crap, with no meaning and it didn't impress me at all. Totally crap! No doubt about that
0385493800|5.0|You can't but help just loving Grisham's accurate legal and law accounts on books, that's why his fictions feel like biographies instead of what they're made to be.  The Testament falls under the same lines of what the  author does best: reality.  Though this book wasn't as great as his widely  acclaimed The Firm, it's just as intense and creative.
087033039X|5.0|Lots of projects, assumes no previous skill.  Great illustrations for people who don't like to read directions.
B000003CMB|5.0|Had opportunity to produce Allmans in concert. Simply amazing, no bs, just music.<br />Best said by Bill Graham in June 1971 at close of Fillmore East.  &quot;The Best of them all, the Allman Brothers Band.&quot;
0385484518|5.0|When you most doubt the utility of your work and relationships, you frequently approach the basic questions of life - which &quot;Morrie&quot; confronts head on in this series of discussions with Mitch Albom. Not only  is this quick read something to which we should often return,but it is also  a work you will happily give to those about whom you care deeply. Read it  and pass along the truths within.
0920668372|5.0|This is a beautiful book that has brought tears to the eyes of everyone I know who has read it.  The reviewers who are bashing the book need to take a deep breath and realize that it's not all supposed to be taken  literally!!  Good grief!  The mother's  continued desire to rock her son is  humorous, not bizarre.  Some people need to lighten up and see the book for  what it is - a beautiful, touching book not to be taken so literally that  you miss the point of the story.
B000002UAI|5.0|I know there are better Beatles-album than this, but Beatles For sale has its own charm, and to me it will always be a special record. not only because it was my first LP, but also because of its humour and joy. maybe  it is the Beatles-album with fewest hits, but it's charming...very  charming.
B000002MP2|5.0|I got the cd Nimrod before I got Dookie.  I was so impressed by Green Day's skills in Nimrod, a terrific followup to dookie, that i went out and bought this cd, the one that made green day pioneers of punk.  Any punk fan  would love a cd such as this.
0060977493|5.0|I loved this book, and could not put it down.  As soon as I finished it, I started at the beginning again.  Imagine my surprise at reading the absolutely vitriolic review written by a sizeable minority of reviewers.  I  guess you can't please everyone,Ms. Roy.  Keep up the great work.  I want  to share this book with all of my truly literary friends who will  appreciate it (they know who they are!)  As for the rest of you, keep on  reading what YOU love.  I'll never forget this book!
068484267X|5.0|I started reading the book and enjoyed his way of expressing himself very much.  I then began to listen to this book on audio tape.  Frank McCort reads it and I believe it meant ever so much more because of his Irish  brogue. He reads it straight, just as it is written, with no theatrics. I  laughed.  I cried.  And I could not believe such poverty existed anywhere.   The story is through his eyes, as a little child,  as an adolescent, and as  a young adult. Through out all his pain, he always found a way to hope.   Thank you, Frank McCort, for being able to share that part of your life  with us.
0783114222|5.0|A 12-hour epic that spans the US Apollo space program.  If you liked Apollo 13, you'll love these.<br />The presentation is first-rate, with outstanding video and audio quality, as well as some of the most novel DVD  menus yet.<br />The set includes 4 DVD discs, with Disc 4 reserved solely for  Extras.<br />Having seen all 12 episodes, all the little untold stories behind  the scenes are what make NASA so special -- the engineers who have a hard  time letting go of the lunar lander, the directors who feel guilty for the  tragedy of Apollo 1.  The list  goes on.<br />Bottom line, a must-own set.
6304504012|5.0|What can I say, Madonna and Antonio Banderas togther singing? It is amazing! The portrayl of this mysterious, beautiful, yet intriuging woman, Eva Peron is outstanding. Madonna is absoloutly amazing. She was meant for  this part. And Antonio Banderas surprised everyone with his amazing singing  abilities. A defenite must see!
0671867369|5.0|Thank you Stephen Ambrose! My father, George L Potter, was in the 101st Airborne, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, E Company WWII. Band Of Brothers, is a true story about what my father and his buddies went through  during the war. I have learned so much about the war, the men, the battles  and my father. <br />What a great book about brave young parachute infantry  soldiers of World WarII. They are all heroes. God Bless Them.
6302415993|4.0|A chilling, thrilling, important movie at the time of its release.  The music remains compelling and the story even more valuable now with the benefit of hindsight and a little wisdom gained with age.  The Grateful  Dead later sang about this whole disaster, &quot;This darkness has got to  give.&quot;  It's debatable if it ever has -- for the Stones, for the Dead,  for the music scene itself.  At least the naivete about drugs is mostly  gone.
6305120706|4.0|Having seen the New York show a couple of times, I acquired this DVD without so much as a second thought.  It is certainly a good keepsake.  I found the video crystal clear and very well done; especially when compared  to Lord of the Dance (DVD).  Colours, details and close ups in Cats were  excellent. The difference in video between these two (Cats and Lord of the  Dance) is like DVD vs VHS (with Cats far superior).  I did notice however  that in one or two places the picture &quot;jumped&quot; and this is the  first time I have ever experienced it.      The Dolby digital audio is  quite good, especially when there were vocal numbers.  However, I found the  surround sound to be somewhat lacking especially during orchestral only  passages.  I think better use could have been made of the rear channels.       I would have given this DVD five stars but the video jumps and the weak  surround sound brought it down to four.  Otherwise, a very good addition to  my movie collection.  If you saw Cats and want a video version of it, then  acquire the DVD despite its minor shortcomings.
078322608X|5.0|I had seen this in theaters but had forgotten how good this Gilliam movie was. Content is a 4.5, video is 4.5, and sound is 5.0.<br />The extras on the DVD include a long feature on the making of the movie, which I found  fascinating. The passion and tensions of Gilliam as a director, his  relationships with the creative talents and budget controllers, and his  trials and triumphs through audience tests and snafus were well-documented.  Wonderful stuff.
0374172897|5.0|So many authors hammer you over the head with their writing (Tom Wolfe's latest comes to mind) that it's refreshing to see an author use subtlety to make an even more lasting impression.  This is a beautiful written,  wonderfully paced book that unfolds in a natural way.  Seemingly ephemeral,  this book will leave you  stunned by its haunting beauty.
630512065X|4.0|Even though I am not familiar with the world of musicals, I do know a great deal about music, and I know that this is great!  The cast is very good, espescially (or so I thought) in the performance of &quot;Jellicle  Ball.&quot;  To me the whole magic of the production was...suprising...
B00000DHRZ|4.0|If you haven't already figured it out.  The new offspring CD &quot;Americana&quot; is also a CD-ROM.  If you put it in your computer, you will find a cool CD extra that has a preview for the offspring home  movie, 4 music videos from &quot;ixnay on the hombray&quot;, and a kareokie  club where you can sing along to &quot;pretty fly,&quot; &quot;staring at  the sun,&quot; or &quot;why don't you get a job.&quot;
B000005PRX|5.0|Ignore the other lame-@$$ reviews on this one, it is no boubt the best of the Batman movies. I am a huge Batman fan, and while it does not hew too closely(OK make that hardly at all)to the comics, it does the character the  most justice. It is the darkest of the four films, and this is what makes  it so great. Too depressing? Nah. Batmans world (as it is portrayed in the  comics) is a bleak and terrifying one. I mean, for christ sakes his parents  were shot in front of his eyes! In making no attempt to candy-coat gotham,  this film, while not acurately reflecting the REALL(comic book) Batman,  gives an extremely acurate feel of Batman and his world. For me, second  only to Star Wars.
0395645662|5.0|I checked this book out from the Library by chance and LOVED it!  I normally hate Science Fiction but this book, taking place in a science fiction world, was very good and you could easily visulise what was going  on.  The book makes you appricate the little things in life.  I immedately  recomend this to anyone who asks, and to all my friends.
0380789019|5.0|I read this book in about two days, I couldn't put it down! At the time I was backpacking through Europe so I really connected with the settings and descriptions of London underground. This is a great little fantasy book,  the characters especially the bad guys are very creative! Great book for a  rainy weekend.
0788811002|4.0|I thought this one was a bit more enjoyable than Pocahontas I. The characters were just as interesting, and the change of location to London gave it a whole new point of view and sense of adventure. The movie seldom  resorts to loud and violent themes (as contrasted with such Disney  offerings as Lion King II, Simba's Pride), and left me feeling like a kid  again, hoping that Pocahontas III was in the works.
0792151712|2.0|It's amazing that Titanic has received such praise and glory...True, the sets and special effects are incredible (it does, after all, take a lot of research to get the clothing and scenery right for a period piece), and the  movie brings out some horrifying points (like the treatment of those in the  ship's lower holds)...<br />The love story between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate  Winslet, THE attraction of this story, should really have been left out, or  at the very least reworked to make the characters full-fledged adults...I'm  no fan of Celine Dion, either...<br />I'm almost Titanic-ed out, but I will  offer one suggestion...Read Clive Cussler's breakout novel &quot;Raise The  Titanic!&quot;  Not only is it more enjoyable, but it's also more fun...
B000001DTM|5.0|I tend to rate my CDs on the premise of how badly I would miss them if I were stranded on a desert island, and this one ranks #1.  Absolutely essential and still &quot;fresh&quot; every time I listen to it.  I don't  mind U2 taking a couple of years to produce an album if the results are  even close to this one.  &quot;One&quot; and &quot;Until the End of the  World&quot; are the highlights of a flawless CD.  Can't recommend it  enough!
0062502174|5.0|I own this book, and maybe you will too!<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed Coelho's story about<br /><br />Santiago and his adventure specifically his transformation<br /><br />to BEING an Alchemist!<br /><br />It's a story about change and persistence.<br /><br />A must read for  people who like to tell stories<br /><br />to their children. The Alchemist is<br /><br />A transformation  story about magic.<br /><br />We are not here for fortune but for meaning<br /><br />and  magic!<br /><br />Santiago is a boy who discovers the real self.<br /><br />It's about fame,  fortune and unlimited love.<br /><br />One may imagine a spiritual partnership with childlike  curiousity, tenacious resolve and unlimited love in a whole new world, now  or not?
B0000025GW|5.0|What irritates me is that so many people won't take someone serious when that person is/becomes religious. Dylan became a Christian and believes in God, Jesus and the Holy Ghost, so what ? Of course, the music on this album  is awsome, Knopfler's guitar is amazing, but let's take the lyrics serious  as well. They are beautiful and full of fire. Maybe you don't agree with  his opinions, but that's no reason to ignore and laugh at them. The song  &quot;Slow Train&quot; must be nominated for his best song ever (what an  anger !),as well as &quot;Precious Angel&quot; , an unbelievably beautiful  song.  &quot; I believe in you&quot; tells the story about all the  insensitive people that will laugh at you when you believe... Fans who  dropped Dylan during this time, were no fans to begin with.
0684874350|4.0|Well, a fairy story this ain't, but it's a fantastic book nonetheless.  It makes us all realise that most of our day-to-day problems are nothing compared to what Frank McCourt went though as a child. That he survived his  childhood and succeeded in life is nothing short of a miracle.  Having been  brought up Catholic, I loved that aspect of the book.  I also love the  lyrical and imaginative ways of the Irish, ie: to get rid of the fleas in  his bed, young Frank is told to turn the mattress &quot;upsoide down&quot;  and that will confuse the little beggars!!!  Frank McCourt writes his story  in the voice of his young self, a curious, sweet and oft times  unintentionally funny little boy and this is a most endearing feature of  the book. Angela's Ashes not always an easy book to read, but persist - you  will come away enriched.
B00000255X|3.0|I feel this album may be overrated a little. True, it's a good album and it does grow on you, but I can't help feeling a little bored when I'm listening to the whole album. I can't say that there are any really bad  songs on Desire, but the only really great songs are in my opinion One more  cup of coffee, Black Diamond Bay and Hurricane. A nice album, not one of  his best.
1563523302|5.0|I'll take 5 more copies for my family.  Mayby they will see that buying stuff is not the way of becoming rich.  This book took the pressure off of keeping up with the Jones'es and helped me to look for lasting value in my  purchases.  Hollywood, go to hell.
0060926317|4.0|Morgan's work described an adventure that, if fictional, was still accurate, perhaps, in the ordeals that she and the aborigines went through for survival. She was, however, slightly less than enthralling in her  writing style. It was well written and believable, and a philosophical  observation if nothing else.
1573226521|1.0|I sat in economy on BA 49 to Seattle and read this thing. I soon got worried. The attractive girl sitting next to me would think I had the mental age of 12 if she saw a paragraph or two of what I was dragging  myself through. <br />I tried spilling wine on the cover, wrapping it in the  world traveller magazine, hiding it under my seat. Nothing helped me from  cringing at some truely awful prose. I've edited my copy with a blunt  plastic knife to remove all mention of Daffy Duck, Vietnam, Video Games,  Airfix toys, Thai Dope Guards. We can discuss whats left.<br />The weird thing  is that I could fully appreciate what Garland was trying to do. It seemed  some formula of Herr's Dispatches + Conrad's Heart of Darkness + Golding's  Lord of Flies. The problem is that all are superb, and not easily  duplicated.<br />Anyway, what really got me thinking (and writing this review)  was how easy it would have been to write this book. Notice the 5 page  chapters. Knock out a few a day. Sprinkle in some Lonely Planet. Add some  dross about video games. Sit back and wait for the film...<br />Anyway, I'm  considering cashing my check with a combination of my own : Lewis's Liars  Poker + Thompson's Hells Angels. Easy money.
B000002BSV|3.0|Its been several years now since the release of &quot;Suede&quot; and &quot;Dog Man Star&quot;, and to me these albums have passed the test of time very nicely. When I first heard Coming Up, I really loved it. i  thought the album was filled with great hooks, and cool lyrics. But to me,  the album already sounds old. It'll be interesting to see if this record  sounds as fresh in a few years, or if its just schlock rock. But Im  enjoying it for now. I cannot however, put it in the same ballpark as Dog  man Star, or the debut.
0792153367|5.0|You will fall in love with Audrey Hepburn.  I think that this is the best of her three big films (Roman Holiday, Sabrina).  She deserved best actress for this one and not Roman Holiday in my opinion.  Don't let the name  George Pepard throw you, this ain't no &quot;A-Team&quot;.  This is a  classic romantic comedy, that portrays the life of two young New York bon  vivants, that survive on other peoples money, and find love with each  other.
B000002NJS|5.0|Madonna has done it again.  She has produced a wave of shock that will surprise even the most devoted fan.  But this time it is not because of profanity or sexually deviant material.  It is because of her newfound  honesty.  In Ray of Light, Madonna takes the listener on a 13 track journey  through her mind and soul.  The album is astounding.  The music is  brilliant, sometimes darkly hypnotic and others heart poundingly  invigorating, a perfect electronic blend of emotion and rhythm.  Lyrically,  Madonna has never previously come close to the brilliance exhibited in Ray  of Light.  Not since the somewhat guarded Like a Prayer has Madonna been so  blatantly and unabashedly open and revealing.  She lays it all out on the  line as if saying &quot;Here's who I am, and here's what I've learned, and  here's how I've changed, and here's what's important to me.  Take it or  leave it.&quot;  Most definitely, one can clearly witness the metamorphosis  Madonna has undergone over the past few years.  She is strong, mature,  secure, and, for once, openly human.  Each song takes the listener into her  mind, discussing topics like the affects of fame, love gone awry, and the  joy of motherhood.  Leaving the brashness,  sexuality, and blatant attempt  to shock behind her this time, Madonna emerges in Ray of Light as not  simply an entertainer, but an artist.  Her lyrics are striking, and her  voice is strong, clear, and rife with tonality.  With Ray of Light, Madonna  has produced her most stunning and near perfect work to date.
B000002L7R|5.0|I was so much younger (and thinner) when I got my first recording of Around The World In A Day by Prince. I remember that it was a clear plastic tape.  I had never seen anything like it. I played that tape so many times  that it skipped. Just listening to the music now takes me back to that  place and time. Who knew that I would still love this music so many years  later - must be 15+ years. I am sure I will still love it 15+ years from  now.
0800137884|1.0|There is no denying that Bram Stoker's Dracula is a very ambitious, big-scale movie with an overwhelming amount of innovation. Unfortunately, it seems like almost nothing works very well. After the impact of the sheer  amazement by the fantastic scenes passes, what we are left with is a  somewhat choppy, incoherent story that starts to look ridiculously  over-the-top very soon. Many of the scenes are desperately repulsive, and  there is hardly a good enough purpose to justify it. The film is clearly  created with an atmosphere that attempts to romanticize all the disgusting  and horrifying things we see - but this does not work and looks  out-of-place. Perhaps some moderation would have helped the movie. As it  is, the film does not take itself seriously and all the  &quot;romanticism&quot; seems to be horribly wasted.
B000000W5L|5.0|The sound quality is variable and the musicianship patchy. You can't dance to much of it. Many of the songs cannot be hummed to. Several make no sense at all. It's best listened to on vinyl so you have to get up and change  sides 3 times. The more scratches the better. <br />Somebody (Elvis Costello?)  said that trying to describe music is like dancing to architecture. I'm not  famous but I say that a great album cannot be broken down into component  songs. Either you get this album or you don't. I think I get it but I'm not  sure why.
0792153189|3.0|It is interesting how few disaster movies have actually dared to depict the catastrophe of a greater scale than the one in Deep Impact. Even the aliens of Independence Day did not threaten the Earth such absolute and  meaningless annihilaiton. However, despite its brave intentions, Deep  Impact hardly manages to be more than average as a whole, primarily because  of the generally predictable nature of the plot. The acting is never too  expressive, and most of the characters are relatively stereotypical. The  idea of selective sheltering, taken straight from Dr. Strangelove, or: How  I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, does seem much more  convincing than in that film - yet this does not help the fact that it is,  after all, an idea taken from somewhere else. And although the film does  summon some emotions about the horror of what is going on, its failure to  focus sufficiently on any one of the sub-stories gives the movie a strange  feeling of aloofness, leaving the viewer ultimately dissatisfied.
0780623819|2.0|I had fun watching this movie, but only after I suspended various stages of disbelief. This movie contains bad acting, bad dialogue, plot inconsistencies, and a few very pointless displays of high-tech special  effects. However, it's a lot of fun: there are some very good lines and  some priceless moments. Overall it's not a bad movie, just a silly, but  nevertheless enjoyable one.
6305076650|3.0|Not quite the worst movie of all time, but that was actually intended . . . The widescreen format is nice, but the &quot;never before seen footage&quot; has mostly been in the theaters before, except for the song  &quot;Once In A While&quot; by Brad, which is mostly  flashbacks.&quot;Superheroes&quot; is nice, but rather than include the  &quot;new&quot; scenes in the film, they tag them on at the end, which is  just aggravating. &quot;Superheroes&quot; actually works well, and the cut  is annoying. Two trailers are also included.
6304341849|5.0|If you liked a &quot;Room with a View&quot; this will not disappoint. It's lavishly done and impeccably acted in a decidedly British manner. Hugh Grant turns a great performance as both a sexual pioneer and a confused  man. James Wilby is in top form as his lover, a Victorian man struggling  with the hypocrisy and prejudice of the time. Their intimacy is depicted in  impeccable taste. Judy Parfitt is exquisite as Hugh Grant's manipulative  mother. Gorgeous cinematography and music. Superlative.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|I had never heard ANYTHING by The Offspring when a friend played &quot;Americana&quot; in his car one night. I liked the sound of the group, and thought &quot;Pretty Fly&quot; was kind of catchy, (WITH the Def  Leppard Sample, don't forget!) So I decided to go out and buy this cd. I  popped it into my cd player, and began listening to &quot;Have You  Ever&quot; and knew then and there I had found something great! The lyrics  to that song made so much sense, I was shocked! This was this past  Saturday, and I have since played the cd at least 3 times a day everyday! I  don't know much about this band, but I know I love this cd. I intend to  stay with The Offspring for quite a long time.
0783225903|5.0|This movie freaked me out the first time I saw it. It didn't make sense.  But unlike some movies which make no sense and turn me off from wanting to see it again, this one held my interest.  I saw it a few more times, trying  to understand the imagery, the scenarios, the interplay between the  characters.  Even today I still can't say I fully understand it.  But I  love movies that make me think; movies which challenge me to accept it for  what it is instead of trying to make some sense out of it.  BRAZIL will  leave you dumbfounded, laughing out loud, grimacing in digust, and rapt  with childlike interest.  Not many movies can claim such attractions.  Love  it or hate it, BRAZIL is going to go down in history as one of those  near-masterpieces too weird to simply ignore.
0060254920|5.0|I'm a 22 year old college student, and I still enjoy reading this book.  I can recall seeing this book for the first time, and being in awe of Max and his great adventure.  I recently recieved this book as a gift, and I'll be  sure to pass it along to my kids.
B000001DVD|5.0|&quot;High n Dry&quot; is in a tie for my fav album with &quot;Pyromania&quot;. High n Dry is exceptional!!!  Pop the tape in the deck, crank it up, and &quot;Let it roll&quot;!  &quot;Bringing on the  Heartbreak&quot; and &quot;Lady Strange&quot; are my favs.  I have yet to  get this on CD, but my time will come soon enough!
6305171769|5.0|Well this one I couldn't keep away from. The first time that I rented it I couldn't believe my eyes. I just loved it and couldn't just watch it once it had to be more than that. Will you make a Halloween 7 or 8 if you do I  believe it will be just has good. Nice action and was Kind of funny too.
0399143904|3.0|Having read all of the previous Jack Ryan/John Clark novels I was looking forward to this, but was in many ways disappointed.  The story doesn't really come together and move at the usual Clancy pace till around page  550, which makes the first two thirds of the book very heavy going.  Also,  we learn nothing new about John Clark, yet one of the subtler pleasures of  the previous novels was the gradual unfolding of his character.  The plot  is, in part, a rehash of Executive Orders and is weaker than Clancy's usual  standard.  Finally, while I always realized the man is right wing, it's now  begining to get in the way of his writing - feral greenies indeed!  And  check out the jacket photo - the man's begining to think he's John Clark  (or is that Jack Ryan?!).
6305169187|1.0|Armageddon was possibly the most tortureous cinematic experience I have ever had.  From the bad acting to total lack of consideration for science, I squirmed in my theater seat waiting for this drivel to end.  And that was  the best part of this movie...when it ended!  Don't waste your time and  save your money.
0880795433|5.0|Roger vonOeck's WHACK series -- cards, books, etc -- are an outstanding way to boost your level of creative thinking in many areas of life: professional, personal, and even parenting/relationships!  Whack-y  approaches to perception and problem solving foster a &quot;don't  panic&quot; mentality in troubleshooting and problem-solving with their  upbeat attitude, but don't let that fool you into thinking that they are  not the seriously useful tools they are.  Highly recommended, R.vanO's  WHACK and related materials will enhance your way of thinking and doing  almost anything to which you apply their concepts!  0:) S.Mako
B00000018T|5.0|This album contains perhaps the last true recordings of Presley as an artist before he sold out his talent to commercialism and excess. Since Presley had been in Army the two previous years prior to this album's  relaease, both he and his manager knew that he had to make a quality  recording or face the possibility of becoming a &quot;has been&quot;. It  was literally all or nothing for him and he really came through in the  clutch with an album that has a little bit of everything. There is jazz,  Fever; a ballad, Soldier Boy; pop, The Girl of My Best Friend; blues, Like  A Baby, rock &amp; roll,Dirty Dirty Feeling and country music, I Will Be  Home Again. In this CD, Presley's voice and phrasing have matured  considerably from his work in the 1950's. The arragements are very well  done and for my money this is his best album of the 1960's and perhaps his  best LP album of original material (obviously excluding the Golden Records  and Greatest Hits Complications). The only difference between the CD and  the original LP is the exclusion on the CD of several pictures of Presley  in the Army which the LP had. Unlike the Presley's 2nd comeback in 1968  which tended to emphasize &quot;Glitz&quot;, this album emphasizes art and  talent. After the classic 50's recordings, this is the place to get  acquainted with Presley's true talent.

The lessons imparted to Mitch by Morrie in learning how to live with high minded priorities and learning how to die with dignity are  something we all need to know.

006092988X|5.0|So beautiful. Such an inspiring story of a girl's coming of age. Every adolescent girl should read this book, and most boys would be improved by reading it too.
0440539811|1.0|I've finished the book.  I reread the parts that seemed important.  I still have no idea what the point of this book is.<br />The cover and the jacket portray this as a &quot;Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&quot; type  book, and it is.  But its humor is weak, its characters inconsistent and  its plot, well, overbearing to say the least.  Douglas Adams shouldn't have  to look over his shoulder for competition yet (at least not from  Wilson).<br />Wilson spends far too much time searching for riddles of  existence to cram into this three book series and doen't spend nearly  enough time trying to make this a good read.  He tries to hard to mimic the  irrelevancy of Douglas Adams' thought process and loses what little talent  he may have for writing.  To make up for it he puts in some interesting  sexual experiences, most of which leave the reader interested in putting  the book down to pick up &quot;the Joy of Sex&quot; and nothing makes the  reader want to pick the book back up. <br />I know lots of people love this  series but I just don't see the point.  IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE WHAT THIS  SERIES IS ABOUT, I'd recommend buying the first in the series (not the  prepackaged complete set) before investing in the rest.  The risk is only a  couple bucks but the reward is saving a few hours and the 10 bucks for the  other two volumes.

0316152196|5.0|In the latest adventures of Harry Bosch, Connelly does not disappoint us.  True to form, he proves time and time again that he knows the inner workings and dynamics of a big city police department and the legal system  that supports it.  This is an &quot;edge of your seat ride&quot; that will  keep you up all night until you are done.  Each time you think you have it  figured out, it takes another turn.  A must read.
B00000G3PA|1.0|Banal garbage to the extreme.  The whole thing looks like the negatives were thrown into a Cuisinart and when they were dumped out the director said, &quot;wow, it doesn't get any better than this!!&quot;... after he'd  downed five bar shots of vodka and rum.  <br />Nuff said.  <br />Dan
0446605409|4.0|I was captivated by the witty dialogue (give me a break if you think it isn't really what we men think) and most of the descriptive passages.  Unfortunately, once we found out the killer (a few pages too soon, I  think), the book became a little formulatic.  When did the killer become a  crazed lunatic?  Why a boat chase scene?  I found it difficult to follow  those passages on the high seas.  By then, I knew how it would end anyway.   <br />Nonetheless, a great ride . . . I immediately went to buy Gold Coast.
0399143904|4.0|Clancy has a great opener for the set up to the story.  Many will remember the mid 70's and through the 80's as hostage ridden.  This story will take you into the world of the terrorist like no other.  Clancy delivers a high  impact ride through the world of those who would terrorize and those whom  the terrorist themselves fear.  As a military officer some would say that I  am biased to this type of reading as it is a story line that is of great  military interest, however, Clancy does his homework and has your attention  from start to finish with a storyline that reaches global proportions and  has you guessing.  The reader is not just treated to the story of what is  going to happen, but all the behind the scenes detail that rounds out the  story, bringing it to a greater level of reality.<br />A great read.
6301942647|5.0|Kurosawa uses the same sense for color he demonstrated in Ran, but the addition of carefully-rendered digital effects show this master connecting the sweep of his career with the newest innovations in  filmmaking  technology. His fear of some technology, his questioning of the sense of  war, and his late-blooming love of life are on full display here. The  conversation between mother and child in the first story and the man's  futile attempt to protect a woman and her child from an approaching  poisonous cloud in story six are not to be missed.
B000002J1S|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see this performed live in NYC at the Accademy of Music in lower Manhattan in December of 1974.  The memories and sounds of that concert still ring in my mind to this day.  I've never seen or  heard a better performance by anyone. Whenever I hear the music, it brings  me back.  It's too bad Genesis' popularity grew after Peter left.  I am  happy to see however, so many realize how good they were when he was  there.<br />GAB
B000001F45|5.0|One of the first 8-tracks I bought, Magician's Birthday is, almost single-handedly, the reason I bought a bass guitar (I've been playing and recording for 24 years).  For the brief time that Heep had Gary Thain as a  bassist, almost any song, however mundane (and admit it, there were a few),  could take one to a world where popular musicians were looked upon as  talented.  &quot;B'day&quot; remains a classic in the  Purple-Sabbath-Rainbow vein, proving that on a good day they could write a  catchy tune with the best of them. If 1964 was the Beatle's year, and 1969  the year of the Zeppelin, then 1972 belonged to Uriah Heep. Check out  &quot;Demons and Wizards&quot; as well, if you haven't already, and lament  with me the demise of one of rock's great bassists.  For one brief, shining  moment, Heep was on top of the heap, and at least we have &quot;B'day&quot;  to remind us.
6302136105|5.0|...in the form of Val Kilmer!  This pseudo-biography of Mr. Mojo Risin and The Doors is mezmorizing.  I thought Kilmer should have AT LEAST gotten an Oscar nomination for his performance.  There were moments in this film that  I swear I was looking at Morrison!  I was entranced by Val and the movie.   I recall when it was first announced that Val would be portraying Morrison,  a lot of people were bummed.  The didn't think Val could hack it.  I knew  he could.  From the first time I saw him, in Real Genius, I  knew he had  star quality!  I figured, if  he can be that hysterically funny, he can do  anything.  And I was right! The thing I find most amazing, next to Val's  uncanny resembelance to Morrison visually and physically, is the fact that  Kilmer sang some of the songs himself!  Talk about eerie.  It bothered me  that the film wasn't particularly acurate.  But Kilmer's impressive  performance is worth watching.  It's almost as if Jim's spirit possessed  Val during the filming.  The shining moments in this movie are many...a few  fall flat.  I highly reccommend The Doors if you were or are a Doors fan.   If you are not...this movie will make you one!

B000002UYZ|5.0|An incredible barrage of outstanding classics and number one hits for the casual listener, selected in a straightforward manner.

015670160X|5.0|*Orlando* is a fabulous woman, man, book, character, everything.  Woolf's writing style is exquisite--you will stop and gasp at certain phrases, and even if you have never underlined in a book before, you will in this one.   You will fold down its page corners, underline fabulous passages, recommend  it to all your friends and put it on your &quot;best books I've ever read  list.&quot;  Orlando spans five centuries or so, hobnobs in high society,  with his beloved oak tree, receives jeweled amphibians from her potential  suitors, et cetera.

1558216847|3.0|If you believe the author, then this is a hell of a story about a hell of an achievement. If it's hokum, then it's not so satisfying a read. The author relates the walk from Siberia to India in a curiously dis-passionate  way. The story also lacks excitement &amp; tension. The chapter titles  clearly indicate when a member of the party is about to meet his maker.  There are no shocks, surprises, serious setbacks, or even villians in the  piece. Apart from a little unfriendliness from a wierd European, the group  encounter nothing but remarkable kindness &amp; generosity all the way.  It's strange! Quite a good read though, but I'm surprised at all the 5 star  reviews here.
B000005J56|3.0|After many playings, the element that is wrong here refuses to go away - in fact, it just gets worse. Buena Vista Social Club is a fabulous album, and has brought international exposure to some great musicians.  Unfortunately, Ry doesn't swing. Every time he touches his guitar, a  country flavour comes into the music as out of place as mayonnaise on black  beans and rice. It's as if he's mistaken slinky for a lack of attack. Ry  Cooder obviously loves and respects the music of Cuba, but Tex-Mex into Son  doesn't go.

6300216802|4.0|The magic of this film, the story, is not the terrible direction, the horrible lighting, but the depth of the story. The plot is simple, go to V'Ger before it obliterates Earth, but on the way, we meet up with the main  crew. Why did Kirk steal command of the ship from Commander Decker and what  problems did that cause? Doc McCoy was re-drafted into service and Spock  re-joined but for what reason? Sure, STTMP borrowed from previous Star Trek  episodes, but what made this movie good was the interaction of the crew,  the sub-plots running all over the place. I urge people to begin to really  watch this movie and see just how full it is. Then you will ignore some of  the problems of this movie. By all means, the longer version is better,  filling out details left out of the original movie.
630433186X|5.0|This is a beautifully moving film.  Wonderful music.  Worth the price just to see/hear Richard as he confronts his wife's betrayal with his beloved Lancelot.  Great scene.
0792151712|3.0|The film was very good up to a point but when I really thought about it, it was a film, not necessarily about the death of 1,507 people but about the love between two. I thought that the film &quot;Titanic&quot; would  depict what actually happened. <br />To be quite honest, I wish that they  would leave the Titanic alone. It is now a grave yard. The film Titanic  could be compared with making a film all about a particular grave yard.
0684800713|5.0|was required to read this book for my high school english class in my senior year.  Since then I have fallen in love with Hemingway's novels.  His book is not just a book about aimless people searching for meaning  through endless glasses of absinthe and wine, it is about human longing.   It is about the need for something to fill the emptiness caused by war.  It  is about passion and anger and all the range of human emotions.  While  reading I was particularly impressed with Hemingway's descriptions of the  Bullfights in Spain.  He managed to capture all the excitement of the  corrida without overstatement.  I would highly recommend this book to  anyone looking for a good story.  Perhaps after reading this novel one may  develop the much praised quality of &quot;aficion.&quot;

0800105141|5.0|Without a doubt, Richard Attenborough's production of the life of Mahatma Gandhi should be considered one of the top five movies of all time. Thoughtful, candid and engrossing are only three of the many superlatives  that have been used to describe this movie. Ben Kingsley is nothing short  of brilliant as the great Mahatma.  Martin Sheen is outstanding as Walker,  an American journalist who meets Gandhi for the first time in South Africa.   Watch for Edward Fox in a minor role as a coldly dispassionate British  Army Officer responsible for the slaughter at the Amritsar temple, and a  very young-looking Candace Bergen as a reporter for Life magazine.  Add  this to your collection as soon as possible.

B000003S1A|5.0|This has got to be one of King Crimson's best albums. The synergy between Belew's and Fripp's guitars on this album is amazing, as is the sound of the chorus effects they used. &quot;Elephant Talk&quot; is an interesting  song with the disjointed vocals, while &quot;Frame By Frame&quot; has some  of the best guitar work I've heard from anybody in a long time. &quot;Matte  Kudesai&quot; is a great ballad, while &quot;Thela Hun Ginjeet&quot; has  some of the strangest lyrics you'll ever hear (I'm still trying to figure  out if it's a real language). &quot;Indiscipline,&quot;  &quot;Discipline,&quot; and &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot; are great songs  as well. Listening to this album makes it difficult to believe that music  of such precision and technical excellence was made almost two decades ago.  Wow! A lot of the sounds on this album do remind me of David Gilmour's  guitar work in Pink Floyd's &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot; (Tony  Levin played bass on that album too). Fripp and Gilmour are probably  friends anyway. But either way, that's straying from the point...and the  point is that this is one of the best albums ever produced. Buy it!

B000002BYA|4.0|Most musicians make their mark in the studio and play on tour because that's how it works.  Most live albums by other musicians have been subpar to their studio releases, but Carnegie hall is an exception.  This album  truly shows just how good SRV could be live.  From the fast paced Scuttle  Buttin' to the beautiful instrumental Lenny, Stevie is at his best.  Even  if you have all the songs on the album from a different album just remember  . . . He never played the same song once.
B000008GS2|5.0|From the first time I had heard &quot;Crazy&quot; on Mtv, to the time I brought it home and heard the title track &quot;Man of Colours&quot;, and &quot;My Obsession&quot;, this has been one of my favorate cds. It has  really stood the test of time, and musically it's still years ahead of  anything that is out today. The music is rich and deep in texture, the  words are relatable and etherial, and the production is top not notch. This  is a definate must for any music collection.
B0000025VI|4.0|This album was Stevie's first in an all too short career.  This was definately one of Stevie's better studio releases, but not his best.  A guitar player's player, Stevie employs his stronger ability as a guitarist  with 3 of the 10 songs being of the instrumental variety, including the  love song which Stevie always dedicated to his wife Lenny.  My only gripe  is that Pride and Joy and I'm Cryin' sound nearly identical.  I guess I ask  too much.  This album does provide a good representation of Stevie's  abilities and is an excellent choice for any collection.
B0000029DD|5.0|With UNKLE's 'Psyence Fiction' grabbing the official title of &quot;THE Crossover Album of the Future,&quot; it is a shame that Jeff Buckley's &quot;Grace&quot; was not given the accolade. As good as &quot;Psyence  Fiction&quot; is, &quot;Grace&quot; truly crossed all boundaries of music  modern and antique. Drawing heavily from influences all over the globe,  Buckley was truly the renaissance man. Inspiration from the also tragically  late Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, from the great Leonard Cohen, and even from the  delicate songwriting of his father (althoough I'm sure he would love to  deny it!), all lends to the most stunning, moving, and beautiful piece of  musical alchemy committed to tape in the last twenty five years. Future  musicians take note- this is what true pasion for music was all about.  Jeff's music made one pine for what they never had, and never could have.  May he rest in peace.
0380002930|1.0|Full of your average bag of teenage book antics (i.e. The Outsiders, The Chocolate War).  Yes, they were pretty good, emphasis on the pretty, but they lacked in depth.  I had a hoot reading all the reviews of this  book-yes, I read all 100+.  Seems to me that Amazon should start reading  the reviews more carefully, this site is turning into a message board where  everything personal comes in.  What sensible book buyer wants to hear for  the 100th time &quot;The best book I have ever read&quot;?<br />Another  point: sadly I'll have to admit the bunny theme was rather lame.  This is a  book that only reaches out to younger children, and are still loved by  those same children in about 50 more years.  This isn't the type of book  written with enough action and plot to make the average adult want to read  a book about rabbits.<br />I wouldn't call this &quot;the best book in the  world&quot; or &quot;my favorite book of all time&quot;, the writing level  was too simple...same on the level of Beauty by Robin Mckinley...even Green  Eggs &amp; Ham had more meaning and thoughts to it.<br />Overall, I am  saying that elementry kids may enjoy this childish and lowly book, but  readers who are up to more challenges should find another book more  difficult, if not more engaging.  Some George Eliot and Thomas Hardy should  do the trick!

Yes, there are many great music. But after  all, Rock'n'Roll should be the music of today or future. And, once, Bruce  was said to be the future of Rock'n'Roll. I hope him to be the same today.  But these songs are all about yesterday. He did the Live album, Best album,  and Outtake album. It's enough for me. I love &quot;Lucky Town&quot;  &quot;Tom Joad&quot; and Tom Joad's tour. They are not about yesterday.  Please Bruce, don't do the Re-Union kind of tour. Just do the new tour of  you and your E-Street band. I believe you can do magic.

You cannot tell me that &quot;The Beautiful People&quot; and  &quot;Irresponsible Hate Anthem&quot; don't have incredible metal guitar  work to them. That's just the beginning. Every song on this is good. Give  it a  chance, you might like it.
076701099X|4.0|The new movie version doesn't come close to the original.I watched this show every week from the first episode to the last,without fail, And of all of them the &quot;Fear Merchants&quot; is the one that I remembered most.  Diana Rigg is, without a doubt, The only Mrs. Peel. And Patrick MacNee will  always be Steed.
B000001Y5J|5.0|This CD is the loudest NIN CD so far. The song &quot;Last&quot; actually is played with the good ol' electric guitar, which is a refreshing change. With songs like &quot;Wish&quot; and &quot;Happiness In Slavery,&quot;  BROKEN takes it's place as one of the 3 best NIN CDs.
B00000DGUG|1.0|When they play &quot;Thank you&quot; on the radio they should preface it with a warning: this is the only song worth hearing on the album.  If the album wasn't a gift to me I would have asked for my money back.
0684843749|5.0|This is simply the best book on bodybuilding.  It is an excellent guide for beginners, which I was in 1987 when the first edition was published, and for advance students, which I am right now.  The &quot;Weak Point  Training&quot; sections for each body parts are extremely helpful.   Overall, it is a complete bodybuilding guide.
B000002P5R|5.0|No post-psychedelic release meant more to me than &quot;Cry of Love&quot;. Then it was out of print. Now it has returned...that is, reborn. &quot;First Rays of the New Rising Sun&quot; contains everything on  &quot;Cry of Love&quot;; but there's much more (from &quot;War  Heroes&quot;, for instance). Honestly, I never believed I'd say this--it's  better than &quot;Cry of Love&quot;. The extra songs seem meant to have  been there in the first place. &quot;First Rays of the New Rising Sun&quot;  is Hendrix' genius on conclusive display, track after astonishing track.  Simply, &quot;First Rays...&quot; is the best music of its day.
0880381736|5.0|WOW! You really can't get much better than this. This has to be about the second best book I have ever read.(I thought dragons of summer flame was better)Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman do an excellent job in all  categories. I especially like Tasselhoff. I thought it was preaty funny  when he got stuck inside the wicker dragons head. All I can pretty much say  is this book rocks!
0684830515|1.0|I had to read this book for english, and I hated it. The book has no theme, except that narcissim is okay. If you are a narcissist, and enjoy drinking, this book is for you. Otherwise, stay away from it.
6304057709|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies, it is most certainly a *classic*.    The story of the Daschwood sisters' troubles are told so sweetly- the sisters love each other so much and want each to be happy.    It is funny, too, Mrs. Jennings and Charlotte lighten up any person's day  yet they also make you frustrated for Marianne and Elinor. The scenery and  music in this film are lovely... they portray the spirit of the scene you  are watching.  This movie was what made me a Jane Austen fan. Immediately  after watching S&amp;S I read it and fell in love with Jane Austen. I think  everyone should watch this movie, you will be touched!
0767817478|2.0|other than some fine effects work, this is the definition of bad filmaking. Bad script, bad acting, bad directing. (get the idea that this film is bad!)an empty souless film that wastes the talents of its FX crew.  With none of the charm or  style of the best of the original films,and only  a big frightened iguana as the monster. one huge missed opportunity. by the  way... have i told you that its also BAD!!!!!!
6301969588|5.0|This movie examines the life of persons on display at a circus due to their disabilities,  how they cope, live, love, and hurt as human beings. It is a sad story of betrayal and the revenge exacted by circus persons  when &quot;normal people&quot; attempt to murder two of the circus people.
006109594X|5.0|This book was highly entertaining and written so that even us &quot;non-navy&quot; type people could understand and follow along.  I loved the people  in the story and hope to see them again in future books  by Robinson.  Also, I think I more clearly understand why it is so  important for us to keep up our military budget!! It may be fiction, but  the reality sure rang through!!
6305169195|1.0|It's the most unrealistic movie I have seen in a long time. Besides, it's the same thing as Deep Impact!
0380002930|5.0|This book has everything.  From politics, religion, and social behavior.  This book alows you to leave this world and enter the world of the rabbits.  I read a review for this book by the Cincinnati Enquire.  It said if you  can read English , you have to read this book.  They were right.  I put  this book in my top five that I have ever read.  It is a must read.
B000003TAW|5.0|There are alot of other bands i like, and tend to listen to more then WEEZER, but, WEEZER is the only band that i like ALL of their songs. There is no other band that has all good songs. Weezer seems to be the only one,  and i give them 5 stars for that, baby! They really are wicked, and i heard  they broke up. That's really a drag, because i could imagine seeing them in  concert, and im sure it would rock!
0792839234|5.0|After I first saw this movie for the first time I said to myself &quot;What the heck was that!?!&quot; From start to finish I couldn't make a damn bit of sense out of &quot;Phantasm&quot; and I loved every minute of  it. I shouldn't bother to explain the plot (there really isn't one): A boy  (Micheal Baldwin) encounters a &quot;Tall Man&quot; (one of horror's  greats; Angus Scrim in a truly frightening performance) in a graveyard who  wants to...do something bad to him he's sure, but his curiousity gets the  best of him so he follows him to a funeral home and then the fun starts.  The last 30 min. (where I REALLY got lost) are the  best.<br />&quot;Phantasm&quot; is one of the wildest, most original and  unpredictable films I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing. And while  this is the series best (I haven't seen &quot;Phantasm IV&quot; yet so...)  as it has the most surprises, you should check out the sequels for more  revelations on the Tall Man, because you find any here.
B00000DGUG|5.0|What a great album!  Alanis expands on her jarring lyrics from her first album to display her true music talent.  People who say she is only a commercial musician are proven dead wrong with this masterpiece.  A  must-have album, and a sure contender for album of the year for 1999!
630197767X|5.0|Even though many critics think it's too simplistic and over emotional B-movie I still feel it's worthy of being called one of cinema's best. Small time pug Rocky Balboa (Stallone) gets a crack at the title that was  supossed to be a show for champ Apollo Creed (Weathers) to show his stuff  on the country's bicentenial birthday, but Rocky gives him more than he  bargins for. Great cast (including Stallone in one of his few  &quot;real&quot; acting roles) and Director John Alvinson definetly does  Sly's excellent script justice. <br />I do agree that &quot;Rocky&quot;  doesn't have the most elaborate of plots, but it has very involving  characterazations and I feel it's very meaningful and just about anyone can  relate with this film. <br />Followed by 4 sequels that got increasingly worse  with each installment.<br />Trivia: The producers wanted Burt Renolyds (!) for  the role of Rocky, but Stallone wanted the role so bad he agreed to do the  part for free.
6305078564|4.0|I'd seen the original cable airing of this mini-series and absolutely adored it. It is, by far, my favorite Austen adaptation. I then purchased the laser disc box set. The DVD simply provides the best presentation at a  fraction of the cost. While the video quality is certainly not stellar, in  my opinion it is not inferior to the laser. (I would have liked to see an  improvement, naturally. As I also wish that Image would have waited to make  it a dual-sided, dual-layer release, thereby allowing the entire  mini-series to fit on 1 disc. Still, I am not displeased.) I would  recommend that any fan of the mini-series add this DVD to their library; it  is a treasure. (Here I insert a plea for more A&amp;E/BBC productions on  DVD.)<br />Lisel
0451169514|1.0|This book was horrible.  I am a huge Stephen King fan but this was by far one of his worst.  If I could give a rating of zero stars this book would get it.  The rating is more for dissapointment then anything else.  The  book started out great, I actually felt that this was going to be one of  his best.  In the middle it started to lose the King magic and by the time  the end came I found myself saying, &quot;That's it?  You have got to be  kidding me.&quot;  These stages wouldn't have been so bad in a shorter book  but this one was over 1,000 pages!!!  This was one of the worst endings I  have ever encountered in any book.  It seems that King had been working on  the book for so long and he just wanted to end it so he could work on  something else.  So he gave &quot;IT&quot; a crappy ending just to finish  it up.  Basically I can sum this review up in a couple of sentences - Bad  Book, 1,000 pages, waste of time, save yourself.  Please stay away from  this book...unless you are looking for a doorstop or something to prop open  your window.
B0000027F8|5.0|I absolutely love this album and I have them all. I am completely and utterly a George Michael fan. Love it, love it, love it. After the Wham days, people were asking, where's the substance? Is it there? Well, ease  your mind. This album is some of the best music you'll get and I'll never  know why it didn't get better billing. It's quite varied and shows  interesting exploration. Beautiful song writing that fits his sultry  delivery like a glove. The sexiest glove you've ever seen. I have tons of  music and this one is one that would be on my list of picks if I was to be  stranded on a desert isle for a long, long time. It's beautiful and has  something to say.
0670813028|5.0|Fortunately  , i read the book first and then i saw the movie which by the way was nice .Reading the book really gives you the creeps.The way King writes is amazing , IT is really terrifying ...One of his best for sure.
0553212478|1.0|Mary Shelley wrote this book when she was 18 and it really shows.  This was the one of the worst books I have ever read, seriously I would rather read the berstein bears.  Mary Shelley uses a lot of fancy words and  complicated sentence stucture but the book really doesn't say anything.  There is no underlying message, it seems that she creates scenes to move  her plot along, for instance the monster must learn how to talk and read so  he camps out in someones shed and observes them for months without  detection, it just so happens that there is a foreign woman at t the house  learning how to speak French.  What a coincidence.  The plot is not  justified, Victor hates the monster because .... I don't know he isn't the  evil spawn of satan or anything, and then there is the monster drove to  kill because he was lonely? Come on now.  Shelley tries to reach emotional  climaxes and moving passages but she didn't have anything to say.  The book  was boring, it had a bland and combined a very vague writing style full of  tautology with not much content, and a &quot;sissy&quot; plot, not at all  scary or even plausible
0385486804|4.0|Truly a modern Greek tragedy that will puzzle many forever.  Good parallel by the author in trying to show that each generation produces a fair number of free spirits that refuse to conform with the majority.  A very good  read.
B000002GYG|4.0|Tom Waits is definitely best listened to live, and this album is the perfect example. The intimate setting, quirky intros and anecdotes make you think of Tom as an old friend -- or at least your drunk uncle who keeps  telling you stories of his exploits in Tijuana. And yet you can't dismiss  him as rambling, because each song goes beyond the one-liners and strikes a  chord in you. &quot;Better Off Without a Wife&quot; is an ironic anthem.  Underneath that cloud of bourbon is a razor sharp wit and keen insight.  Wonderful.
B00000253N|5.0|Is this Dylan's best album ? It's definately a masterpiece. The songs are so simple, yet so sensitive and beautiful. The music is sweet, yet so mysterious. You can sense the sweet pain and suffering of the singer. In my  opinion the highlights are &quot;Simple Twist of Fate&quot;, &quot;You're  gonna make me lonesome when you go&quot;, &quot;Buckets of Rain&quot; and  &quot;If you see her, say hello&quot;. The only song I don't think is  awsome is &quot;Meet me in the morning&quot;. If you wanna buy a  non-sixties CD by Dylan, buy this one. After that you've got to buy Slow  Train Coming and Time out of Mind, two of his other unbelievably strong  albums that are not from the sixties.
0553573403|5.0|I loved this book.  Lots of well drawn, complicated characters.  I read tons of fantasy and have grown quite weary of the cumbersome tomes that stretch on through 3, 4, 5 and even more sequels so it is with much  pleasure that I found this book and realized the genre isn't dead!  I'm  very excited that the sequel is out and I can't wait to read it too.
B0000026UL|5.0|This album can be described in one word: GREAT. The lyrics are just right, if you like the darker side of Dylan with a high degree of desperation, anger and mystery. The music is good too and producer Daniel Lanois did a  great job. No wonder Dylan asked him to produce last year's Time out of  Mind, an album that's probably even better than this one. Songs like Ring  them Bells, Man in the Long Black Coat, What was it you wanted, Disease of  Conceit  etc. are all awsome. There are no bad songs on this one. Buy it  and enjoy it. Don't buy it if you only like happy music though. Then you  would better stick with the Spice Girls...
6304346107|4.0|I really liked the Kate Beckinsale version of this famous novel.  However, I read the book, and it was intended as a humorous look at the &quot;elite&quot; in society.  Gwyneth Paltrow's performance, as well as  Mr. Knightly (in the Paltrow) version, seem to keep more in sync with Jane  Austen's intended voice.  Still, a great movie....watch both, and make your  own comparisons.  Both pick up different aspects of the original!
B000001F5A|5.0|One of Vangelis' best works brings together the vastness of the continent and the wonderful warm melodies he masters so well. Each song is different in it's own way, but the Artic theme is felt and heard throughout the  Album. The combination of ambient and nature-like sounds makes this a  brilliant musical experience.
6304082428|5.0|Wow!  I had previously seen the BBC production of this famous tale, and loved it, though I thought the Darcy they used much too austere. This version was SO well acted.  I agree with another reviewer that when Darcy  stares at her across the room, you sense his heart.  I have watched and  re-watched this video, and each time find new things in it.  I thought this  Lydia much more saucy and believable than the one in the BBC version..much  more likely to run off with Wickham.  <br />I also felt that the portrayal of  the Protagonists in the story (Elizabeth and Darcy) more light hearted.   Jane Austen was known for her quick wit and humor (which is why she found  favor with the Prince Regent).  I felt this adaptation more in the spirit  of what Jane Austen herself would write.
0782008372|3.0|I've been a true Highlander fan since day one. No Highlander II(somewhat OK) or Highlander III(Bad story, great effects and great sound)or the TV Series (OK, saving the differences in general)will ever improved the  original...like it's said in the movie: &quot;It can be only one !!!&quot;,  and that's the reason why I still give it 3 stars. I was ready to enjoy  watching the movie again in my 50&quot; TV with Dolby Digital Sound,and  expected to be amazed by this flick again...but, the video picture is the  worse I've seen in DVD, you can even see the little pixels of different  colors on the screen, and the sound isn't great either: the Soundtrack  sounds all right(not great, what is a sin, considering the great soundtrack  by one of the great Rock bands of all times, and one of my favorites,  Queen), the surround effects and the Dolby 5.1 tracks in general could have  been used better to create an unforgettable experience of revisiting this  classic on DVD.And is a shame that the VHS isn't great either...  If you  want to convince someone to buy a DVD player, don't show them this movie,  show them for example the latests Bond movies &quot;Goldeneye&quot; or  &quot;Tomorrow never dies&quot;, where the picture and sound effects are  unbelievable...If any of the producers or the DVD Engineers for this movie  read this review, please make a new and &quot;reimproved&quot; edition of  this movie, a lot of funs like me will buy the new DVD and thank you and  congratulate you forever !
B0000019PA|1.0|I eagerly anticipated this CD based on the many favourable reviews listed here, but I was sorely disappointed.  The vocals are horribly off-key and remind me of raking finger nails on a chalk-board.<br />It appears that people  feel passionately about this CD -- they either love it or hate it. Not for  music-lovers.
0679736646|5.0|OK, yeah, the writing is sloppy; PKD could be an exquisite prose stylist (try THE TRANSMIGRATION OF TIMOTHY ARCHER), but you'd never know it from reading this.  On the other hand . . .<br />This *might* be the most  unpredicatbly plotted, insanely entertaining novel ever written.  You know  how some books have plot twists and turns and ups and downs that make them  into veritable roller coaster rides?  Well, UBIK is the Space Mountain of  literature.  You're in the dark the whole way, and, boy, the ride is  wild!<br />But wait, there's more!  This seems like an outrageous claim to  make of a book that's so much fun, but UBIK is also one of the most  profound, thought-provoking explorations of the nature of reality ever  written.  And the profundity doesn't get in the way of the story one bit!   How *does* he do that? <br />UBIK has been shown to be an effective  reality-decay preventing dentifrice when used in a conscientiously applied  program of metaphysical hygiene and regular mental-health professional  care.
6302000823|5.0|Arguably the greatest movie ending of all time, with Ennio Morricone's greatest score, this one is an all time keeper. I am constantly surprised at the number of people who have never heard of it, let alone seen it.
1567184855|1.0|I'm probably the only dissenting vote, but I found this book to lack any believabilty. The unidentified subjects used odd language that was not conversational in nature, thus the interviews seemed pre-written and not  spontaneous. The whole book smacked of hoax. Why would such a break-through  go unnoticed by vitually everyone? I'm sorry I lined the author's pockets.  He'll probably write a sequel. Would any of his subjects come forward?
630179513X|5.0|This excellent is one of the few superior sequels.  The director made an excellent choice of putting the story in the wild west. One of the best parts of the story is at the town fair. Alot of things happen here and i  love the music in this movie.if you havent seen this movie make sure you  do. This movie is totaly different from the others in that doc falls in  love and causes some trouble and marty finds his relatives back in the  past!
0425129586|5.0|this is a really great books for young adults. It has lot's of mystery that they would enjoy. I love how they everyone goes missing.
0684874350|5.0|What a wonderful book. No one has ever written about poverty in quite this way. What is so powerful is how vividly the McCourt's living conditions is portrayed without ever resorting to self-pity. How lucky for us readers  that Frank McCourt was able to escape his condition and grow up to write  about his youth and coming-of-age with such intelligence, humor, clarity,   and forgiveness. I will not soon forget any of the characters of this  exceptional memoir.
B000002TLX|5.0|It is an exellent album with many great songs like &quot;Angelia&quot;, &quot;Hazard&quot;, and &quot;Hold on to the nights&quot;
B000001Y2U|4.0|I must admit I didn't like this album at first.  I heard Mechanical Animals first and thought it superior, more accessible.  But with this record, after you strip away the things done for shock value, shows a group  willing to work hard at their craft, and take the pains to produce a really  good record.  That is why AntiChrist Superstar won't fade away into the  category filled with other &quot;satanic&quot; recordings.  It's not a  masterpiece, but for it's genre, it's close enough.
1568495110|5.0|Never have I read anything as spectacular as this.  It was a great tolchock in this malchickiwicks gulliver as I read this masterpiece.  I had a blast with this one, stayed up during the whole nochy, steadily  befriending Our Humble Narrator, Little Alex...
6303481272|5.0|I thought that this was one of the best anime works that I ever saw.  The characters were good (although I did not like how Kagero was portrayed was rather sad) I liked the plot and the animation was top notch.  Although it  contains MANY sexual scenes (of which my mother did not appreciate) but  besides that I thought it was great.  I did not think of it as particularly  violent, I have seen much worse.  Personally this was one of my favorite  movies of all time.  (second only to Ghost in the Shell)
6303972810|5.0|Willow is one of the best fantasy/family films ever.  Val Kilmer and Warick Davis are fantastic!  Not to mention the other heroes and villians this film captures.  Most of all, Queen Bavmorda, the evil sorceress.  (  She was great! ). I saw the film Willow when I was 5 years old at the  theatre, and I will never forget it.  It is my favorite movie of all time.   The special effects are wonderful.  It's out of stock though!  So if you  haven't seen it, RENT IT! You won't be sorry.
0792151712|2.0|Though I don't really like romance or gentle movies, Titanic still touched me for a while.  Leo didn't dress to look like a real third class passenger. He was too clean for someone who wonders around without a home.   His Colgate smile and Head &amp; Shoulders coiffure were definitely NOT  turn off the century characteristics. I don't know why the girls like his  pig-face American looks, he needed a bit more Irish cut and accent. The  graphics were realistic and the special effects had some depth.
6300151379|5.0|Why aren't they re-releasing this movie?  It is apparent that many people have been moved and deeply affected by this movie and in a very positive way.  It would only serve to better our lives if we could watch it more  frequently.  Henson was a genius and, so far, there has been no one to  match him.  Why is his work being restricted?  This movie was a lot of fun  let's hope the next generation gets to experience it as well.
0684830485|5.0|This book is an excellent book.  But, if you really want to understand it, spend part of your life living in Spain like Hemingway.  Then, you can finally appreciate how he writes in &quot;Spanish&quot; and translates  literally to English, especially the cursing.  You will love the country  much more than reading books or visiting Madrid or Barcelona...
6303965415|4.0|Don't let the erotic-looking cover fool you on this movie.  It was tastefully done and very true to Jane Austen's novel.  I enjoyed the obvious lack of &quot;super-beautiful&quot; people playing the parts of  Anne Elliot, Captain Wentworth, and the rest.  These were truly humans, not  supermodels.  Well done.
0792151712|5.0|It was very hard for me to believe as I walked out of the theater after seeing Titanic for the first time that something would replace GWTW as my favorite movie. So, I was forced to see the Titanic again, and again, and  again! And as I am neither brainless nor a teenager, I do not fit the  standard repeat audience demographic. Were there flaws? Sure. Were certain  lines cringe worthy? Oh yeah. But in the end, this movie worked and worked  well. It brought you the tragedy of Titanic on a personal level. For those  who have joined the &quot;I am too intelligent, eclectic, or original to  fall for the Titanic hype&quot; Club, I offer only my condolences. It must  suck to have lost the magic of imagination.
B00000AFGM|5.0|Best manson out there.  Only reason it doesn't have a 5 star avg. is that some people like to post reviews of the album without having ever heard it, simply because they think Manson sucks without ever having taken the time  to listen.  If you listen to this album, you'll like it.
6305169187|3.0|it was okay.  i thought the whole asteroid thing was really stupid.  i mean how many times is the US going to save the world.  ID4, Deep Impact, MIB, and all of those other movies just made this one seem mediocre.  the  special effects were really cool though.
6305169187|5.0|Some call this flick 'an epic' while the other  'a gabbage in bin', there are only 34 words that I can say to this; Enjoy This Film Leaving Your Lives Behind; We Are Here To Enjoy The Ride, Not Wanting To Take A Look At  Our Normal Life All Over Again, Otherwise, What The Hell Are We Trying To  See Of A Movie Like This?
6303122647|5.0|Nightmare Before Christmas is wildly original, full of great songs, great lines (&quot;nothing's more suspicious than frog's breath!), and great animation.  Our 2 year old fell in love with it -- for a while, we were  watching it twice a day (which was worth it to hear him sing the songs).  A  true classic.
0060392584|4.0|Being a late gen-Xer, I never understood the popularity of Marilyn Manson. Then I read his book.  I now have a new respect for him, as he is very intelligent and honest about his band and career in this book.  I think  anyone who reads this book will be equally impressed, especially if you  were also a &quot;child of the 80s.&quot;  Thanks Marilyn, for letting us  all into your childhood!
0899663036|3.0|This novel tells a story: a can't put it down, page turning story.  However, evaluations of this novel as a five star work, or &quot;masterpiece&quot;, may lead prospective readers to believe that  superlative literary technique is involved.  Certainly it is a stunning  work, something of a period piece (and enlightening in that respect), and  it is an emotionally moving story.  But it is a story that is told from a  variety of viewpoints that are not clearly developed nor developed through  inventive or identifiable technique.  This limited criticism gains in  perspective through contrast:  whereas Toni Morrison may shift perspectives  in many of her works, engage magical realism, and countless other  techniques, Smith shifts without the clearly conscious development  (requisite?) that an author such as Morrison employs.  Smith, as authoress,  speaks and speaks again interupting the voice of  character and relating  stories that develop the story -- punctuating the novel as story -- a very  good story.  The story that the novel tells is well structured and  believable, replete with conditions and experiences of a protagonist that  unviersally invite readers to recognize character-building truths within  realistic parameters that resonate throughout the pending turn of the  century.  The  foundations for empathy are believably developed and it is a  page turning read.  For these reasons, the work maintains the status of a  &quot;beloved&quot; work, but in all fairness it reads as an incomplete  work of &quot;literature (of the highest rank)&quot;.
630469797X|5.0|Director George A. Romero has created with DAWN OF THE DEAD possibly the best entry in the horror movie genre.  The mall is the perfect place for the characters to trap themselves in.  Instead of a more claustrophobic  house setting, there is a vast expanse of hallways and openings any number  of zombies could catch you off guard at.  When the living and the dead  encounter each other, Tom Savini's grossly brilliant makeup effects are  allowed to shine.  And boy do they!  This is some of the most realistic  gore ever to grace the silver screen.  And on DVD the movie looks great.  The added footage is a true treat for fans of the movie and the packaging  is quite handsome.  Don't delay another minute; pick this one up before it  goes the way of the zombie.
0790731185|3.0|This film is very good in the sense that the acting was terrific and the plot was very good.<br />They could have cut down on the senseless violence that went on in the film. There was no need for that kind of brutal  violence. Any light-hearted oerson would have flinched at the thought of  the violence that went on. <br />I'll put it into perspective of a person who  would take it seriously<br />There was no need for the brutal attack on Andy  DuFrain by Boggs and the &quot;Sisters&quot;.<br />There was also no need for  the brutal attack by the captain  of the guards, Mr. Hatley.<br />There was also no need for the brutal murder  of Tommy who was going to testify against the murderer of Andy's  ex-wife.<br />To sum up, the film was good, but too violent
0790733226|5.0|This is an engaging and thoughtful story that goes beyond the typical Sci-fi genre to plumb the depths of what drives us.  Jodie Foster does an outstanding job of portraying a driven scientist who discovers something  about life and herself in the end that wasn't what she bargained for.  This  is all wrapped up in a very slickly presented tale that captures the  reality of today's political world.  At the same time the story has it's  moments or heart-tugging emotion.  The music fits perfectly.  Everyone  should not miss this Sci-Fi masterpiece, especially in this DVD version.
1559408758|5.0|Criterion continues to astound movie lovers with each and every addition to their laser catalog.  While some may wonder why &quot;This is Spinal Tap&quot; belongs in the Criterion roster, anyone who's seen the flick can  tell you that no collection is complete without it. Although this isn't the  4-1/2 hour version, the inclusion of 75 minutes of cutting room gems make  this DVD a necessary purchase.  Moreover, the 2 commentaries open whole new  dimensions to a film that already works on so many levels.
630469797X|5.0|Director George Romero delivers a horror masterpiece with DAWN OF THE DEAD.  Usually sequels lack what their predecessors possess, but this one goes NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD one better. Besides being the best movie in  the zombie movie genre, perhaps the greatest thing about this film is  make-up artist Tom Savini's frighteningly realistic cosmetic effects.  The  amount of gore here is certainly not for the weak stomached.  Watch this  one with your eyes open and in a well lit room.

0812550706|5.0|Card has an amazing ability to paint a bleak picture of the human race and then pick one particular human, and make him shine. You can't help but feel for Andrew Wiggin.  He's been in basic training since he was 6.  He's  seperated from any friends he makes, and kept out of contact with his  sister, the one person who means anything to him.  Oh yeah, and he's  expected to save the world.
0793927501|5.0|The story is rather pessimestic yet the ending is lucidly triumphant.  Hopkins, a soft-spoken, bookish billionaire, married to a young, beautiful model(elle macpherson) discovers while stranded in the Alaskan Wild that  his wife has been having an affair with a photographer(Baldwin) with whom  he needs to get along to survive after their plane crashes. Part of David  Mamet's message is that life is bleak. His wife has betrayed his love,  other people value him only for his money and what he can do for them.  But  by the end of the movie, after battling with fate that had brought Hopkins  face to face with death and with life's suffering and betrayals- to the  &quot;edge&quot; of our existence, Hopkins claims his solitary victory with  a triumphant but a subtle smile.  When asked by Baldwin what he'll do when  he is eventually rescued, Hopkins answers figuratively, &quot;I may not go  back.&quot;  Asked why not, Hopkins answers poignantly, &quot;To  what?&quot;
B000003AEB|5.0|This is the cd that made deathrow what it is.  doggystyle is pure hardcore.  daz, kurupt, nate, warren g and others are featured on it.  snoop really flows on this.  very explicit, but great music
B00000DFTH|5.0|I am not the biggest BS fan in the world, but this is an amazing album. If you believe the liner notes that no overdubbing, or re-recording was done, then this is one tight band. They sound great, Ozzy's voice is as good as  ever. If you are looking for the one BS album to own, I would make it this  one.
0441003257|4.0|Angels &amp; Devils tweak the world with a kind of absent mindedness akin to Joe Average flipping channels with the remote control. The antichrist has been born.  And wouldn't you know it, he got switched at birth and is  being raised by the wrong family...  That is, the WRONG wrong family. So,  what can be said of the end of the world when the one causing it is mostly  just interested in playin' games and hanging out with his friends and a  hell-pooch named &quot;Dog&quot;? Read, and find out.
0800130936|5.0|this movie is any action type of person's dream.  Great actors and tea leoni is a good compliment to Will Smith and Martin Lawrence.  I must have watched this movie a hundred times when it came out on video, and i went  and saw it 5 times in the first seven days released in the cinema.  &quot;TWO THUMBS UP&quot; definitly.
B000002MUW|5.0|I knew many people will hate this CD because they were used to Madonna being a dance diva and scandalous. Well, here she shows us that she is also able to sing with feelings and emotions, accompanied by soft grooves that  set your mind to really get the song and it's message. Perfect examples are  &quot;Love tried to welcome me, &quot;Take a bow&quot;, &quot;bedtime  stories&quot;, &quot;Insde of me&quot; and &quot;sactuary&quot;. There are  very few CDs I listen to from begining to end. This is definitelly one of  them. Too bad she didi not promote this CD and had a tour - Evita stoped  her from doing so. THis CD deserves a closer look. I just love it!
0812550757|4.0|Card's characters are perfectly distinctive.  You'll swear you could pick them out in a crowd.  He blends them all together with such a feel for their personalities that you can't help but believe they're real. Hard  science fiction is not his strongest suit, but he tells stories like  nobody's business! I'd love to see him team up with a more hard-core SF  writer in the future.
B000002NJS|5.0|I know, many here say they love Madona and have been fans forever. I however, think of her as not just a singer, performer, artist, but further, I think this woman is able to see inside of people and herself, and is able  to quantify with words and poetic frases what she finds in our and her  soul. To help us understand her vision, she delivers her songs dressed in  music that takes us to a state of mind where her words make sense and where  our minds are able to visualize her pain or hapiness. I think that Madonna  demonstrated this ability in Bedtime Stories, even though the CD went by  without much fanfair. Here she proved that it was not a lucky strike or a  one time wonder, rather she is able to grow and learn from her life  experiences. This CD, like Bedtime Stories are my favorites from Madonna.  She really opens her heart and soul, like in Power of Goodbye, Drowned  Worlds, Substitute for Love and Nothing really Matters. These songs take me  on a trip everytime. If you just hear (not listen) to the CD, you'll  probably find it boring and a experiment in strange music. Once you really  get to listen to the music and the words and her angelical delivery, you'll  be hooked like most of us. By the way, the CD is permanently placed in my  car. I can't get tired of it. I think Madonna will never dissapoint me. She  is superb to say the least.
0394800184|5.0|I grew up with this one, as did some of my family. It's a real treat, worthy of inclusion in any child's library.
B000000OQF|5.0|This CD contains my favorite song of all-time PARADISE CITY.  This song is the purest song I've ever come across.  Don't forget the award winning SWEET CHILD O MINE.  The lyrics on this song are incredibly created.  All I  have to say is THE GRASS IS GREEN AND THE GIRLS ARE PRETTY.
0783228317|5.0|I like another reviewer missed this movie in the theatres, and I now kick myself for not being able to experience it larger than life.  Nevertheless, what an awesome portrail of an acid trip.  Tweaking all night, laughing at  sober people as the drug shows you the dramatic scenes of melting carpets  creeping slowly up the walls.  My favorite scene without a doubt is Raul  Duke, slinking up to the hotel check in counter and loudly blurts, &quot;Hi  there!&quot; SO TRUE! Your mind even plays trick on our vocal volume  levels...have ya noticed? Grasping the rim of the counter, sinking lower  towards the floor as the hostess' face almost reaches a three-sixty he  mutters &quot;What's next.....whats the score here?&quot;  CLASSIC!
0375701427|1.0|This book is too old, too male, too white and too long...  It examines in excrutiating detail all trivial issues and neglects the interesting and important ones.  The story goes nowhere fast and keeps sinking after you've  finished.

0345403959|5.0|This book, Belgarath the Sorcerer, is wonderful.  While I read it, I felt that I was in the book!  If anyone tried to talk to me, I could not hear them. I was so interested and involved in the book.
B0000074PH|5.0|In the early seventies, the critics hated them ,but we - the fans - loved them. If you start to think about Uriah Heep, get Magician's Birthday. It is full of magic. Listen to Blind Eye and Rain. If you do not have enough -  get their 4th album release 71 - Demons and Wizards.
6304184832|5.0|This mocie was great...It had action and special effects thru the whole thing not just parts of it. Great tornado effects.The cow was totally awesome. I think this movie is a must get for  anyone who likes disaster  movies.
0670880728|5.0|When I pick up this book I couldn't put it down. The book was so funny that I lost sleep until I finish reading it. Helen is so creative and so real that she protrays all us &quot;singltons&quot; in the exact manor that  we come in. I have recommeded the book to all of my friends and they love  it just as much as I do. No book compares with that of Briget Jones Diary.
0780622642|5.0|This was a great movie. I never actually liked the old series but this movie Rocks! It had great special effects and has a good story that keeps you intrested. But one thing, the robot was not that great. I think they  could have made him more hi tech and all that. Also that was good about it  was that the whole family can watch it. I hope they make a sequel becuase  the movie kinda left it in the air...
0767822900|5.0|Here is one Children's book more delightful than all the Madeline Books put together.  Hatty Jones stars as Madeline, the smallest and naughtiest of all the twelve orphans.   Based on the Madeline Books by Ludwig  Bemalmans, this Film begins when Madeline had to have her appendix removed  and ends when the principal finally agrees to let the girls keep the  school.  Though most of the time the girls are very well behaved,  sometimes they would get into Major trouble.  One part was when the cook  fixed a chicken dinner and none of the girls liked it, Miss Clavel sent  them to bed without any Supper, and they snuck down to the school kitchen  and tried to make a cake, and ended up having to clean up a big mess.   I thought it was very touching when Madeline was all well again, but still  in the hospital, and went to visit the principal's wife who was sick and  dying, but she loved Madeline about as much as Miss Clavel.  Later on  in the movie, Madeline fell into the river Seine, and almost drowned, and  the orphans adopted the dog.  But the principal did not approve.  It  was sad and funny at the same time, when Madeline ran away to the circus  and when the orphans got back on the bus to return to school, Madeline's  friend held up Madelines hat, and so when twelve hats were counted, Miss  Clavel thought she had twelve girls on the bus.   Finally Miss Clavel  found Madeline and Geveveive the dog who saved Madeline when she fell in  the river.
B000003Z4C|5.0|I came unto Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds through a peculiar route. Metallica covered the song &quot;Loverman&quot; on their _Garage Inc._ c.d. and I happened upon _Let Love In_ and decided to purchase it in order to  hear what the original version of the song sounded like. I was astounded! I  keep track of how often I listen to my c.ds each month (so I can throw away  those that aren't being put to use) and _Let Love In_ was listened to more  than any other c.d. that I have ever listened to in one month. I am a poet  and writer of short stories and the crafty lyrics and contagious rhythms of  this c.d. put me in the creative mood. Highlights of this c.d. include the  songs &quot;Red Right Hand&quot; (which was in the movie _Dumb and Dumber_  and on a documentary on Snoop Doogy Dogg... go figure), &quot;Jangling  Jack&quot;, and &quot;Salty Dog&quot;. The bold headline above is a portion  of the lyrics from the song &quot;Do You Love Me: Part 2&quot;. &quot;Do   You Love Me: Part 1&quot; and &quot;Do You Love Me: Part 2&quot; are the  types of songs that one is simply unable to get out of their heads. The  first part of the song begins the c.d. and the second portion of the song  brings the c.d. to a beautifully chilling end. Part 1 deals with questions  dealing with whether or not a female loves the narrator and the second part  deals with homoerotic conquests and perhaps shades of past abuse. The pair  of songs are strong enough to nearly leave one in tears... or at least  breatless.
0316152196|5.0|This newest Harry Bosch novel may be the best. Connelly continues to develop this character, moving in surprising directions with each outing. A few inside jokes (references to characters and events in prior Connelly  books) are quite enjoyable. Five stars plus!

0060392584|5.0|I could not put this book down, it was interesting, funny, sad, intelligent, honest, and  very insightful. It perfectly described my favorite celebrity, the man that society loves to  hate. People may say he  looks or acts strange, but what if their child was born mentally retarded,  or had an unsightly growth on his/her face?? Would  they want anyone to  judge them by this?? It's just further proof that humanity hates and looks  down in disgust at anyone different than them. But really, what can be  called normal?? If God wanted everyone to look or act the same, it would  be.  This book is all that and a bag of skittles!!!!!

6305252521|5.0|I'm not normally a fan of Jim Carrey, due to his seemingly one-sided character.  However, this movie proved me wrong!  I love this movie and plan to buy it the minute it's available to have in my library.  Excellent  plot concept, and yes, the role does appear to be made for Carrey!

0812550706|5.0|After procrastinating for years, I bought this baby and tore through it in a day. It's well-constructed, with nothing wasted. It has clear, interesting themes, and deftly-sketched characters. And, of course, it's a  rollocking good read. In the introduction, Card apologizes for the lack of  hard science. I say, if you want good science, you can always go read a  textbook. You want a story, you read a novel.
6303823351|5.0|I'm a Beatles nut  =)  I think it shows a lot of growth on the part of the Beatles.  It is their first film that has a &quot;plot&quot; of sorts to it.  Hard Day's Night was great in the respects of a documentary type movie  of what it was like to be caught in Beatle mania.  Help actually shows the  loyal that these guys have talent beyond being cute. I think the best parts  of the movie are the humor.  For instance:  Paul's big adventure on the  floor, Ringo and John's dialogue about the &quot;season ticket&quot; in  Ringo's soup.  The movie is truly a classic.  I could watch the movie  10,000 times and every single time is a brand new laugh; a new experience.
1573225517|5.0|Nick Hornby has really written a wonderful book about life.  It's that simple.  It is both hilarious and heartbreaking, it never misses a beat, its fast and furious and impressive.  If this falls into too many female  hands, however, all our secrets will be out.
0385484518|5.0|This is quite frankly one of the most compelling books I have ever read.  As an &quot;executive&quot; who works over 70 hours a week, it really hit home. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.  I read it in two days.  It  was difficult to put down.  I recommend it to anyone that needs a  &quot;lift.&quot;  READ IT!!  It  really made me think about what is important in my life.  Think about it.   When we get older, how many of us will say, &quot;I wish I had worked more  hours.&quot;
0780624963|5.0|I thought it was the best vampire action movie I have ever seen. I always thought of Wesley Snipes as a so-so action star but in this movie he changes my mind. He's AWESOME. I am a fan for life. I can't wait for future  BLADE movies. Keep up the good work.
6305252521|5.0|I loved this movie.  From the subtle way it lures the viewer into believeing it's just a film to the startling realization that our lives have in essence become mini-Truman Shows, the film gives us an entertaining  yet horrifying glimpse at our world.  I can't wait for the DVD!!
6305108153|1.0|This movie is great.  It is highly terrifying, highly suspenseful, and has an engrossing plot. That of a child killer, put in an asylum for the criminally insane, escaping, and going back to the hometown he came from to  seek revenge and recompensation.  The methods and ways he kills in many  ways seem to almost bring out the fear of &quot;what if...&quot; one of the  childhood killers of this day were to get out. Its over 20 years old but it  is the BEST in the series (I have seen them all)
630514415X|4.0|Denzel's always incredible performance and Sayeed's cinematography are beautiful.  This is one of Spike Lee's best movies, although sometimes meandering plotlines weaken it.
0553260111|1.0|There's nothing like a good page-turner, but this isn't it. Like all Ludlum plots, there's a killer hook (amnesiac assassin seeks his past), but 600 pages of implausible and tedious mush lies behind it. Ludlum also  writes like a court stenographer, which doesn't help matters. Try Household  or Buchan instead.
B00000DGUG|5.0|this is a really neto CD!! A hint for lsteners: listen to the whole CD about twice before you make a judgement. after that the songs will really stick on you. <br />alanis has a talint of making her voice sound diffrent  when she wants to. all of her songs are really indavidual and unique! i  love it!!!!:) go alanis!
079073804X|5.0|Truly amazing.  Not only has Warner Bros. managed to present a gorgeous presentation of the film, but they've packed in a great BBC documetary and 2 audio commentaries that are a must for admirers of this work.

It transforms your view of the world,  turning it into a glorious, magical place... but the story itself doesn't  merit much.
B000000Y27|5.0|this is the sweetest sound that ever came from a guitar, and the magical overall quality that this record shares with coltrane's 'giant steps'is due in no small part to the presence on both sessions of tommy flanagan, who is  like the teddy wilson of our time.

Dare I say that even men will be amused by this book?
B00000AFHM|5.0|This album continues the tradition of If You're Feeling Sinister.  In other words, it is another great album that is just perfect to listen to.  The lyrics are among the best of what's around and the instrumentals of  this octet just soar.

B000003C4K|5.0|The fact that you are entertaining the thought of buying this record means YOU KNOW YOUR METAL. Back before ballads, big record contracts and cheese, this band and this album blazed a path of heaviness and destruction over  all other forms of underground music. Exodus will always be mentioned in  the same breath as Slayer, Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth and Celtic Frost,  as these were the bands that put all &quot;underground&quot; rock on  notice: you're all wusses.
0790734850|5.0|This is one of the best &quot;bargain&quot; DVDs yet released.  Not only are you getting the wonderful film which is both technically and aesthetically pleasing in every way, but also all the wonderful little  perks, most notably the isolated music score. The documentary and LA tour  are also great.   It's the disc I use to show off how wonderful the DVD  movement is to disbelieving friends -- they're impressed to say the least.  If you don't have any DVDs yet, this is the FIRST one you should buy.  If  you have volumes of DVDs, but not this one, shame on you.

B000002J09|5.0|If anyone out there loves good, solid, classical rock.  Then this album will be a glowing star amongst the rest.  Zazo is the best of all Led Zeppelin albums.  They are usually known for Stairway to Heaven, but the  final song Levee, is simply great.  Their strong grasp for Blues harmony,  and ground thumping beat in this song is astounding.  Never once in my life  will I ever give more praise to a CD.                    -Neal Hoogenboom
B000002NJS|5.0|&quot;Ray of Light&quot; is Madonna's best CD in a long while.  The arrangements are superb, the lyrics a vast improvement over her earlier work.  &quot;The Power of Goodbye&quot; is classic, and though the title  track is excellent, it is &quot;Sky Fits Heaven&quot; that lifts me out of  the doldrums: &quot;Life fits living/So let your judgements go/That's how  our future should be.&quot;  How true indeed!
0790736926|5.0|As we approach the end of the century and films are ranked, this classic, definitive Western is deservedly appearing near the top of most every list.  Even the &quot;politically sensitive&quot; and &quot;revisionist&quot;  reviewers are compelled to do handsprings (usually _ad hominem_ attacks on  Wayne)to try make their agenda in the face of this epic work.<br />Central to  this film is the brilliant performance of John Wayne as the tormented  anti-hero Ethan Edwards.  His cynical, hard-bitten character embodies the  full range of racial hatred for the Commanche and dread at the sexual  violation and torture of white women captives that one can find in the  chronicles of early Texas.  Sorry revisionists!  This is the way it  _was_.<br />_The Searchers_ is one of the first films that takes up this  subject, and it acknowledges the Victorian view that once defiled a white  woman would not be accepted back into society.  Watch the scene with  Edward's reaction to the female captives brought in by the Seventh Cavalry.  That Edwards barely resolves the question of survival in favor of his  niece is a function only of that most human side of his character-- his  devotion even beyond the grave to the girl's mother whom he loved, but who  married Edward's brother.<br />John Ford's trademark humor barely relieves  what is one of his darkest films.  The much written about conclusion is one  of the iconographic moments of the American Western.<br />With outstanding  cinematography, a rousing soundtrack, and wonderful characterizations (see  Ward Bond as the Preacher and Ranger Captain), this is a great film.  But  it is Wayne's performance that makes it a Classic.
0399143904|2.0|This was a terrible book.  Right-thinking fascists blow the daylights out of horrible, menacing tree huggers.  The characters were so unreal it was hard to finish the book.  It would have been much better to portray the  trained killers (the supposed heroes)as tortured ambivalent souls rather  than caring family men.  Caring family men do not become covert operatives,  stroking their guns for a living.  Also Clancey allows his own disdane for  environmentalists to show through and often allows his characters to preach  to the reader.
6303269826|4.0|It is ironic that Wyatt Earp, who lived long enough to be a movie studio consultant, never saw his own story rendered into film.  Since Earp's death at the age of 84, there have been many such movies, and he has been  portrayed by Henry Fonda (_My Darling Clementine_), Burt Lancaster  (_Gunfight at O.K. Corral_), James Garner (_Hour of the Gun_ and _Sunset_),  Kurt Russell (_Tombstone_) and many others.  Regrettably, all of those  films attempt to improve upon what is already a fascinating story.<br />This  dark, biographical film is only three removes from the man, Wyatt Earp,  having passed first from Earp to his biographer, Stuart Lake, and now  through Kevin Costner's interpretation.  I suspect that we still have the  essential Wyatt Earp in this film, particularly as compared to efforts such  as the cartoonish _Tombstone_ which was released at about the same  time.<br />Unlike other reviewers, I find the film plodding at the start with  the real interest peaking after Earp becomes a lawman.  I would also note  that if the real-life Josephine Marcus was unhappy with Lake's biography,  she would be horrified at the depiction of her husband in this film.  But  then, Josephine was devoted to maintaining the two-dimensional lawman/hero  image of her husband.<br />Costner portrays Earp as what he claimed to be: a  businessman.  Earp brought the same pragmatic, hard-nosed approach to law  enforcement that he did to his other endeavors, exuding a cold ferocity and  ruthlessness that seems to have cowed opponents without the fatal use of  the officially sanctioned weapon he carried.  The film accurately portrays  the truly minimal killing done by Earp early in his career and up to the  point when the aftermath of the O.K. Corral signaled a homicidal vendetta  against the enemies of the Earps.<br />Costner was made to play Wyatt Earp,  but Dennis Quaid nearly steals the show with his interpretation of Doc  Holliday.  The first meeting between the two is one of the best scenes in  the film.<br />So far as there ever can be an accurate depiction of the  Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, it is presented in this film, as is the  aftermath.  With cinematography reminiscent of _Dances with Wolves_, and an  excellent score, this movie presents Earp as a human, three dimensional  character of flesh and blood.<br />This film deserves better consideration  than it has received from critics heretofore.  Taken in context and without  the misplaced desire for another _Dances with Wolves_, this is the  definitive film on the life and times of one of the West's legendary  figures.cenes in  the film.<br />So far as there ever can be an accurate depiction of the  Gunfight at the O.K.

0800177177|5.0|This excellent movie is a combination of aesthetics, horror, erotic, violence and art. Coppola did an excellent job on creating the horrofying atmosphere. My personal opinions regarding to the actors:<br />Gary Oldman and  Anthony Hopkins: unreplacable for their brilliant, perfect performance.  Anthony Hopkins reminds me the movie &quot;The Exocist&quot;.<br />Keanu  Reeves and Winona Ryder: Good enough for young actors(I like Keanu with  white hair in the movie).<br />Sadie Frost: I only saw her on this movie and  know nothing about her. She is un-neglectable.
6303855466|5.0|I first heard about this movie in the review section of the local paper when it first came out. It got the reviewers highest rating, which sent up the first red flag for me, because 95% of the time, if he rates it 5 stars,  and it isn't action-adventure, it is usually heinous by my measure. I  therefore did not see it in the theater. Big Mistake. While it does not  lose too much in the translation to small screen, (At least I don't think  it would), it kept me from knowing this wonderful movie for a year. I  finally saw it on video, and was instantly captivated. If you can  understand what is being said (no mean feat sometimes, the accents can  throw you for a loop), this understated little gem will instantly sweep you  off your feet. Especially engaging was Colm Meany (Of Star Trek:The Next  Generation and Star Trek:Deep Space Nine fame, as Morgan The Goat (The  village has a lot of people living there with the same first name, so the  villigers identify certain people by their occupation, or other things  describing them (your guess as to why they call Morgan &quot;the  goat&quot;, he runs the motel in town)). He, and the preacher were the two  standouts in the movie. SEE IT is all I can say, and I can't say it with  enough passion.
B000002JS6|5.0|Every Hard Rock band tries to match this power classic, but no one will come close. Still gives me the chills. Now that it's been re-released digitally remastered, no rock fan, young or old, should pass it up.
B00000G3PA|5.0|This movie was very enjoyable even though parts of it were not quite believable.  If you want to see a movie that makes total sense this is not the one.  If you want to relax and enjoy two hours of incredible special  effects, this is a must see.  For those of you who are complaining about  the movie not making sense, what did you expect from a science fiction  movie?   Quit your wining.
B000000OF6|5.0|These two CDs are the best of Queen.  For those who don't know much by Queen, you'll recognize songs like &quot;We Are The Champions,&quot; &quot;We Will Rock You,&quot; &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody,&quot; and &quot;Who  Wants To Live Forever.&quot;  Definately the greatest CD collection ever!
B000002UAU|5.0|I think this is by far, the best Beatles album of them all. I have all of their albums!! This is my absolute favorite!! I listen to this album almost every day and never get tired of it. My favorite songs are Lovely Rita and Fixing a Hole. These two songs  (especially Lovely Rita) give you a great feeling inside . . .yet I don't  know why! Get this album and you'll never regret it! Enjoy listening
0385484518|5.0|As the author of 'Life and Death on the Internet' I wanted to let everyone know that 'Tuesdays with Morrie' is an absolute must.  When a book this moving comes along it deserves praise.  Buy it.  Read it.  You will be glad  you did.
0684847817|5.0|Exceptional illustrations!!!  Richly detailed text!!!  A stunning piece of work!!!  A must-have for all faery lovers!!!
6303921248|5.0|I didn't think I would be able to watch this long movie, but after the first 5 minutes it is my favorite story and movie. Read the book the day I saw the movie. They couldn't have gotten better actors for the parts.
B0000033TE|5.0|This is the one, the album that invented &quot;Techno&quot; (along with &quot;On The Run&quot; from Pink Floyd)...&quot;Karn Evil 9&quot; shifts man-ergs of energy at lightspeed while quoting the Italian Futurists and  Alexander's Ragtime Band; &quot;Jerusalem&quot; powers a great slab of  British Empire nostalgia; &quot;Toccata&quot; simply blows N.I.N. and their  fellow-travellers away. Great stuff, particularly in an inarticulate  grunge/rap/dance age; some granola-lesbians in P.C./Seattle once accused me  of being a Fascist for loving this album...ELP uber alles!
0345298349|5.0|And I'm sure I'll read it again!  Absolutely one of the best books of the 80s, period.  Prepare to lose a lot of sleep.  Soviet detective Arkady Renko battles bureaucrats, businessmen, Commies, the FBI, the KGB, a  gymnast ex-wife, treacherous pals, and even an angry mink.  Five stars,  check it out.  P.S. Don't forget to read &quot;Polar Star&quot; and  &quot;Red Square&quot;.  The first is almost as good as &quot;Gorky  Park.&quot;
0385474547|5.0|This is a meticulously written novel no matter how simple the language may seem.  Achebe concentrates more on theme and characterization rather than elaborate plot scheme and language.  What this does is it makes the book  easy to read for anyone, college lit student or third grader.  Colonialism  is a dangerous entity, we know this, but Achebe lets us see this by  developing characters like Okonkwo and contrasting them to Okonkwo's  deadbeat father.  We must feel sympathy for these Ibo people no matter how  simple they seem in comparrison to Americans because, in essance, their  culture was destroyed by propaganda, which is also what led to the Nazi  party, and political powerhouses such as Huey Long.  Don't take this book  as immature because it's simply writen and manifestly unAmerican, because  like any powerful weapon, like a stealth bomber, it's in disguise.  A  lesson we all need to learn lies within this book, and we can't overlook it  simply because we have the &quot;opportunity&quot; of living under a  democratic regime.
0316152196|5.0|WOW!  What a read.  Wish there were more stars to award this book.  Michael Connelly has brought Harry Bosh back in full glory.  The twists and turns are all there, as Chief Irving pairs Bosh with his old nemesis,  Sustain Chastain, to solve a case that combines all the dangers of every  case that has been in the public view over the past 10 years.  There is  only one problem with this book, and that is that Michael Connelly has  totally ruined every other author on the market for me.  I can no longer  enjoy mysteries or adventure stories by any other writer.  So I have to  read trash until Connelly issues his annual fare.  I find myself re-reading  Concrete Blonde and Trunk Music because the re-read is better than the  first read of any other author.  Keep 'em coming, Michael.  Bosch is the  best of them all.
B0000026T4|5.0|It takes quite a man to make an album that has Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora on it sound good, and Alice Cooper is just that man.  It is amazing how many truly soon-to-be classic songs are on this album.  Poison, House  of Fire, Bed of Nails, and so many more.  The only problem is that Trash  the song is just that.  But hey! buy the CD and you'll never have to listen  to it!
6305232660|1.0|This is simply an awful movie with really good actors walking through their parts.  I saw this movie immediately after seeing Armageddon and their is no comparison - Armageddon is much more excting both visually and  as a story.
B00000DG1R|4.0|&quot;Decade&quot; makes me think of sun,sand,oil! All things hot!!! Which is a very good thing!  All their best from the 80's &quot;Rio&quot;, &quot;Union of the snake&quot;, &quot;Hungry like the wolf&quot;, etc. on  this album make it a must have. Plus, some newer such as &quot;Save a  prayer&quot;.
B0000036I9|4.0|I loved the Barbra Streisand movie so I just had to see the original it was based on. This is definitely worth watching if you've seen that version. This is much darker than the American version. I can't say one was  better than the other because both have their strengths and weaknesses. For  example, the remake is a little long while this one is the right  length.<br />It shows a teacher (who lives with his mother) who places an ad  to find a wife. This couple arranges to have him &quot;meet&quot; their  unattractive daughter who's inlove with this guy who her attractive sister  pretty much stole from her. The teacher and the ugly duckling get married  &amp; have children. All seems fine until ten years later, when the couple  meets a plastic surgeon who offers the wife a new face.<br />And since it's  French, there's stuff in this movie you won't see in American films from  the 50's. I think this is definitely worth watching... especially if you  saw the whitewashed 1996 version.<br />Moral of the story: &quot;a woman's  body is hers and it is not a man's place to tell her what to do with  it!&quot;
B00000DGUG|1.0|In my life time I have thrown two tapes out of the car window at high speeds.  And never any at slow speeds.  The first one was probably digested and responsible for intestinal bloat of some wild boar -- and this new  Alanis album is probably by now the stuffing of a rabbit's nest. This new  CD pissed me off because it lacked the integrity of their first brilliant  production (Alanis has such the jagged edge).  It lacked the re-work and  production ear needed to bring a quality focus to the music.  Is the band  hypnotized by success? Do they believe that we, the buying, admiring public  will groove on anything.  I just am wondering what happened here?  Jagged  Pill is so great in contrast.
B000002BPS|5.0|It has a lot of great songs on it. My favorite is either mota or Me and my old lady. Just get this one and don't *uck with Americana.
B0000013G9|5.0|I love Crazy Sexy Cool
0380789019|3.0|What you would expect from Neil Gaiman if you've read almost all the comics book he collaborated on.  Standard stock characters; with only minor changes the story could easily be part of the 'Books of Magic' or 'Sandman'  series.  Well written, I read it in one sitting. It would make great  airplane fare.  Reccomended for an easy read, but in no way memorable.
6300268993|3.0|Superman 2 was going to be directed by Richard Donner but due to many problems he was fired. Lester took the job but took it in the wrong direction, the cheap feeling in the film is evident and the big battle  isn't as good as what Donner planned. New powers were added which really  was plain silly, it made Superman too good. The best bits of Superman 2 are  all the Donner sequences, which include all the Lex Luthor sequences. We  were also promised that we would see Brando reprise his role as Jor-El, his  footage was cut out and replaced by Susannah York. One important scene  where Jor-El commits suicide to save battered Clark would have been  amazing, this was shot by Donner. Due to greed it was not used in Lester's  version. Superman 2 is a disappointing sequel. The tv edition does help to  improve it by a long way
6305177473|5.0|This movie is so cute! I think that Lindsay gal is a great little actress! She acts better than most regulars her age. I recommend this movie to anyone. It has it all! You can watch it again and again!
B000007PSR|5.0|This is a deeply inspiring collection of outtakes and previously unknown tracks from a collapsing genius. Syd Barrett isn't for everyone, but if you are into his unique vision, you will be entranced by these spare,  stream-of-consciousness takes.
0385484518|5.0|Iam a Taiwanese and I have read the book in Chinese half year ago! During these half year, I had been seeking of find these English adition for such a long time! It is a wonderful book to read and after I read this book , I  really moved by him. If you can be HIM after you read this book. I think  Morrie will be very happy in Heaven. It's the best book I have ever read.  My e-mail is :s844506@student.thu.edu.tw if you think it is a wonderful  book . You can write leeter to me . We can share the feeling.
B000001Y42|5.0|Limp Bizkit is like koRn only better.  I can't wate to hear Lip Bizkit's new cd.  When I first saw Limp Bizkit's video on Mtv, I thought it was the best.  My friend has the cd and I really want to get it
B000001F6N|5.0|After Eric Clapton left the Bluesbreakers, Mayall had to find another guitarist and he struck gold with Peter Green, who was certainly Clapton's equal if not better (as if one can seriously rank musicians). This is an outstanding example of his powerful  blues playing. The songs are more varied than on the earlier recording  \\"Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton\\" and Green has a less agressive tone, but his cover of the Stumble manages to equal Clapton's \\"Hideaway\\" and \\"Another  Kind of Love\\" is a great variant on \\"Double Crossing Time\\" on the other recording. In addition we have his quirky \\"The Same Way\\" and \\"The Supernatural\\" and his breathtakingly powerful fills and solos on \\"Someday after a While\\".  This record makes you realise that Green was/is a great player and his melancholy style is quite unique. The rest of the band are also, of course,  exceptional. I usually think of this as a more interesting album than \\"The  Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton\\", but perhaps the playing is a little less  thrilling. Still an absolute must for any fan of electric blues playing.  One of the five best blues guitar albums in my opinion.
B00000G3PA|2.0|No doubt, the special effect of this movie was outstanding. But that's all about, for $150 million dollars. Maybe that was the only reason I bought it on DVD even though I saw it in the theartre. It was just another  &quot;corny&quot; movie in 1998, after &quot;Godzilla&quot; (*1/2) and  &quot;Deep Impact&quot; (**1/2). Hollywood studios have spent a lot of  money on visual effect these years, however, the stories are getting worse.  Although &quot;Armageddon&quot; was the number one movie in 1998, by the  box office gross, it does not mean it was a good one. I still have to say  that the DD 5.1 sound is one of the best on DVD.
B00000F1D3|5.0|This one of the many &quot;pop divas reinventing themselves&quot; albums that we're seeing more and more of lately, but this one is different.  Cher's the original; she's been around the longest.  And it shows.  She has  managed to create an album that is creative and dancy but totally Cher.   There are latin sounds, amazing ballads, and techno beats like the best  DJ's in NYC.  This is not an album for the faint of heart: this is an album  for anyone who appreciates creative and talented musicians making  electronic music sound amazing.
B00000G3PA|4.0|Very good movie, but exactly like Deep Impact! It's not as sentimential, and it has more action that is what made it good. Also very realilistic! Excelent computer images!
B000000ITM|5.0|From the first overdriven powerful vibrato notes of Clapton's Les Paul, you realise you are in a new world of blues guitar playing. Incredible today and it must have been overpowering in 1966. Clapton's powerful tone  and style is exceptional. My favourites: 'Hideaway' (makes Freddie King's   original sound pedestrian), 'Double Crossing Time' (great rhythm lines and  blistering solo), 'Have you Heard?' (heartstopping solo work), and his tour  de force, 'Steppin Out'. The band are outstandingly good too and Mayalls'  solo 'Parchman Farm' provides a good resting point from guitar overkill. I  agree with the other reviews in that 'What I'd Say' is comparatively weak  and the drum solo excessively long and dull. I always fast forward over the  solo, but find the rest of the track enjoyable. Hughie Flint was a great  drummer, just not a great soloist! <br />Any lover of electric guitar music  should own this outstanding recording.
6304578458|5.0|I love this movie! It is THE BEST! It has everything from comedy to romance to action. Not too mention the fact that it has John Cusack! Minnie Driver is also great in this movie. And Dan Akroyd cracks me up. And who  could forget John's awesome sister Joan. She is very funny. If I could only  have one movie, it would be Grosse Pointe Blank because it is great for  whatever mood you are in. My advice...BUY IT!!!
067960085X|4.0|This book's highlight is not its story, however fluid and lyrical as well as imaginitive, but it's main character, Holly Golightly. She is one of the most likeable characters in literature; the one star marked off is for the  vagueness of what happened to her, since the story is so short, you can't  help but wonder and care what happened to her.  In most versions, you  will also have the short story, &quot;A christams memory&quot;. READ this.  this story is the most sentimental short story i've ever read.
0670880728|5.0|I usually get bitter and straight-faced when reading supposed 'humorous' novels... just another indication of my innate difference from other people (and their sense of humor)... a sense of betrayal from all those people who  SAY they are my friends. This book was, actually, v. funny. At one point I  laughed for 5 minutes straight. Helen Fielding has created a perfect  quasi-epistolary _Pamela_ for the 90's. What's more, she has done it so  deftly that I, a man, was not alienated but rather came to understand my  wife's orbital mania re: planning vacations. Yes, I'm a MAN and I enjoyed  this NOVEL. Don't look at me that way. You would enjoy it, too, if YOU were  man enough. V.v. recommended.
0792151720|5.0|I believe that the only reason some people do not enjoy this film is because they are afraid to go along with the views of everyone else in the world.  There is always going to be the handful that have a need to go  against the grain--and it just serves us right to take their opinions with  a grain of salt.  <br />     As movie critic for a major newspaper, I attended  many pre-release film screenings in 1997, most of which seemed to take the  world back to the classics of the early century.  After the screening of  &quot;Titanic&quot; I was approached by several colleagues and asked  whether or not I enjoyed this film; my reply was for them to simply pay  attention to the television screen come Oscar night.  <br />     &quot;Good  Will Hunting&quot; was great!<br />     &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; was  beautiful and chilling!<br />     &quot;As Good As it Gets&quot; was  hilariously brilliant!<br />     &quot;The Full Monty&quot; was, eh, good.<br />      But &quot;Titanic...&quot; what more can I say than 'perfect?!'
B00000897V|5.0|Incredible progressive metal with stunning vocals and guitars. If you like Queensryche or Dream Theater, you will love Virgin Steele.
B000002JB8|5.0|I am a big fan of the &quot;master&quot; of the one man electronic symphony. I have most every recording he has ever released, and patiently await his next. I was not swept off my feet at first listen to Oceanic as I  have been in the past by releases like  Direct and The City. This one crept  up on me and delivered an incredibly addicting affect. Although subtle, the  CD (when given fair play time) enraptured me with deep ethereal complexity  and power. I can feel the heat of the sun and the crash of the waves  whenever I listen to this CD. Like no one else I've discovered, Vangelis's  music creates for me  emotion in visually textural  climates. Oceanic is  just another of many of his musically magical worlds I love to explore.  Close your eyes and give this one a try!
6304288433|2.0|I have always believed that the Halloween series should have been left at the first one, and perhaps H20 as a commemorative.  This is Jamie Lee Curtis' last role before H20 (17 years after this movie).  This movie  relies more on really nasty murders (not just with Michaels knife) as  opposed to suspense, and spine tingling terror of the first movie.  I  believe horror movies that go on suspense far outweight those that have to  show graphically intense needles in eyes, people boiling to death, etc.   These things can be done, but Halloween 1 did it with class.  There is not  the same class here.  I believe it was going against the Jason movies at  this time and of course we know those are absolutely nothing but plotless  gore flicks.  I give it two stars SOLELY for the fact they continue the  plot by introducing the fact Laurie Strobe is in fact, Michaels sister.
B000006ZH9|5.0|This is classic Rory Gallagher.It's quite interesting how Rory's music has changed through the years from his early albums to his later music.Each album has a different style yet the same blusey rock.This CD is great from  start to finnish.Souped up ford and bought and sold are two of my  favorites.If your a true Rory fan I would grab these CD'S while their still  available.Every one is 5 star as far as I'm concerned! The music world will  really miss this rock legend!
0790736314|5.0|This movie is frightening!This is what I call horror!Believe me! There was one part that showed regans head turning around!&quot;eeww&quot;!The makeup was horrifying! I wish i'd never seen that movie! I can't sleep anymore!
0780624890|4.0|On DVD this is one hell of a ride. The picture is clean and the sound is breathtaking. The special effects and all of the special features make this a must have DVD.
6303430570|5.0|I'm the kind of person that hates it when other people say, &quot;Ya gotta go see this movie!&quot;  For that reason alone, I was predisposed to hate Clerks.  However, I must say that this is one of the funniest movies ever  made.  Between its jokes about sex and the way that the characters analyze  Star Wars so in-depth that you'd think that you were back in English class,   I laughed so hard I thought I'd pee.
0767803434|4.0|As far as DVD's go this movies sounds the best. If you don't have a Dolby Digital receiver this movie screams for it. Turn it up, turn down the lights, turn off the phone and pop the popcorn.
B000002KM6|5.0|You could say that this is Van Halen's best &quot;Guitar album&quot;! It has a controlled fury from one song to the next. Lots of energy and right on the edge. This album, in itself, is a testament to the genius of Eddie's  music and sound. Unfortunately, if you don't own this CD, you probably  haven't heard many of these songs because they don't get much air time on  the radio. So if you haven't already, pick this one up...it will blow you  away!
B00000G3PA|5.0|It has a limited amount of features, 2 trailers and the Aerosmith video, but the sound is ear ringing awesome. You must have Dolby Digital to fully enjoy this movie or any action movie for that matter.
6305169187|5.0|I loved this movie I jumped, I laughed, and almost cried. Well you have myopinion  see it for your slf I assure you won;t be dissapointed!!!
B000000HHE|5.0|When I was about 20, a friend of mine got me to listening to De La Soul and I loved them from then on. A couple of years ago that friend of mine died and whenever I listen to their music it reminds me of her. What good  memories. Thank you. Anita Nations
B000000IVS|5.0|This is, quite simply, one of the very best albums ever made, and it brings back the drug-induced euphoria and occasional stupor of my youth.  The album (CD, really) is unique in that it is both of great historical  interest, yet still, after all these years, kicks butt as well.  For fans  of &quot;Heroin&quot; and &quot;I'm Waitin for my Man&quot; who may be more  familiar with these tunes from Rock n' Roll Aminal or Lou Reed Live, this  gives you some great insight as to how these songs sounded in the early  years (alas, I never had the good fortune to hear the Velvets live).   Alternatively, some of the most creative, interesting, cynical and  otherwise enjoyable songs the Velvets have done - &quot;There She Goes  Again&quot;, &quot;Black Angel Death Song&quot;(try playing this one whilst  tying up the one you love) and &quot;Femme Fatal&quot; - are all here for  you in one place.  This is a great &quot;snapshot&quot; on the era (before  Lou started doing establishment-type things like playing at the White  House), but, also as enjoyable today as it ever was.  (Most everyone I know  still refers to this as the &quot;One with the Bananna on the Front&quot;).   Definitely a must for the next generation.
0780624890|3.0|Apart from the action sequences and some good visual effects, I found the movie quite boring and dragging.  I didn't know where it was going or what the director was intending.  And the ending (the Russia sequence) was  completely unncecessary and added to the movie's downfall.  It should have  been left out.  I guess I shouldn't have expected too much, though, from a  comic book action movie.
B00000AFHM|5.0|I thought this was a great CD, very mellow and entertaining
0671004611|4.0|Corso not only tells the facts of what happened in Roswell in 1947, but relates his feelings as he contributes to the government's cover-up of the incident.  As an &quot;insider&quot; he had access to the actual crash site  debris and the reports generated by the various military, medical and  industrial researchers assigned to analyze the spacecraft, aliens and  technology found at the site. Corso openly tells the story through his own  personal experience with the incident.  He gradually progresses from the  date of the crash until his last days in the military.  He reveals his own  thoughts and explains how the government hushed the discovery while  disseminating the &quot;foreign technology&quot; to those most qualified to  do something with it. On the whole, this book provides some valuable  insight into the government's propaganda machinations and yet is an easy  and entertaining read.  After reading this book, one is free to decide for  themselves if an alien craft did crash in the Roswell desert.  However,  this book leaves you feeling that something happened there based upon the  level of government involvement.  If the facts as told by Corso are true,  then we can truly say we are not alone in the universe!
B000002NBY|5.0|I had always heard a lot about this album before I listened to it. It won the Grammy and sold over four million copies. Entertainment Weekly rated it as the 4th best album of all time. It's as good as everybody says it is. If  it isn't in your CD collection, you've got a serious problem. From the   abstract brilliance of &quot;The Boy in the Bubble&quot; to the poetic  beauty of &quot;Diamonds on the Souls of Her Shoes,&quot; Simon delivers an  eclectic tour de force. The mixing of American pop with African samba and  New Orleans zydeco is absolutely spellbinding. &quot;Graceland&quot; is the  most successful musical experiment since &quot;Sgt. Pepper's.&quot; And the  music is as fresh as it was in 1986. Simon never reached to the artistic  heights of &quot;Graceland&quot; again. But let's all thank God he once had  it in him.
B000002HMH|4.0|I didn't start listening to Metallica until the Black Album.  All their previous albums were serious heavy metal music which really doesn't appeal to me.  Their newer albums such as Load and Reload really show a more  mainstream less heavy metal banging style that really allows all those out  there that like Rock/Alternative music but not the heavy heavy metal stuff  to buy and enjoy these albums.  If your a Metallica fan of the old style,  then yes I can see how you would say they Sold Out but if you like music  the leans toward the metal side with a nice tune but is not screaching  yelling music, then I highly recommend this album as well as Reload and the  Black Album.
B000002A3T|4.0|After being disappointed for several albums, this is the first one since 'The Wall' worth buying. the music is inspiring but with the exception of a few tracks is just an ordinary Pink Floyd album. I do Recommend this one,  but as one of many.
0767812417|5.0|This musical is a great standbye for years to come. Mark Lester and the rest of his  entourage, make this Dickens' a classic in every since. The songs, some of which are old standards, like &quot;Consider Yourself&quot;  and &quot;Where is Love&quot; we hear on the radio often. The movie is full  of great choreography and music. Buy this and then sit back and enjoy one  of the best musicals of the 20th century.
6304196784|5.0|THE funniest movie I have ever seen - and if you can imagine a romantic movie with quite a bit of slapstick - this is it! Kevin Kline is hysterically funny (love the CIA scene!), Cleese is wonderful and Jamie Lee  Curtis is perfect.

0871137380|5.0|My husband has been a Ranger for 2 and a half years, and I have always been fascinated by military, especially Ranger history. Working for the post newspaper here at Fort Benning, The Bayonet, I had the opportunity to  get an advance copy of Black Hawk Down.  From the first sentence I was  hooked.  Not only is fighting in great detail, you come to know each  soldier and what makes them tick. Let me tell you, if a Ranger wife likes  it this much, each and every soldier, especially Rangers and D-boys, will  love it.
6300185249|4.0|What a pleasure this movie was!  If you are a home owner and have done any &quot;fixing up&quot; you will laugh uncontrollably.  Some where in the movie you will see yourself at some point.  Enjoy.
B000002699|4.0|In a Silent Way is a terriffic LP.  It is not music that you simply listen to, you experience it. It is in this way that it transcends traditional conceptions of music. That You experience it the same way you experience  good art. You're not just looking at it, you are  reacting to it, you're in  its presence.  Not only do you experience it, you perceive yourself  perceiving it, which acts as a tool for extending one's consciousness,  which I believe is what good art achieves.  Listening to In A Silent Way, I  react to it; my skin crawls, I get a little bit antsy, my ears  &quot;widen&quot; to listen, and I'm put in a certain mood that is not  describable.  Right now incidently,I'm listening to a Third Eye Blind Cd,  and I can say that the aforementioned disc is the antithesis to what Miles'  music does for me.  Where 3eb is mindless, redundant mainstream dribble,  Davis' music is introspective, trailblazing and mildly yet tantilizingly  disturbing.  The same can be said for his Bitches Brew, the double album  after this one, even more so.  Do yourself a favour and buy both of them.
0679759328|1.0|I don't get it.  I know I'm behind the times, but as I was traveling through Morocco I found an old copy of Hotel du Lac and paid about 20 Dirhams (about $2.25).  I was robbed! Not only does nothing happen in this  &quot;book&quot;, but I got nothing out of it at all.  Was 1984 such a bad  year for the Booker Prize folks that THIS won???
B000002J0B|5.0|Led Zeppelin's Houses Of The Holy is truly a classic rock must-have!!!  The album opens with the classic &quot;The Song Remains The Same&quot; and never lets up!!!  The Ocean No Quarter and Dancing Days mark the high water  mark for the music of this era!  Nobody did it quite like Zeppelin!!!!
0792153189|4.0|Having seen both Deep Impact and Armageddon, I can say that I much prefered the former.  The effects were very good, the story line well done.  Indeed, it did develop several subplots.  Life is that way.  Life can also  get &quot;mushy&quot; at times.  There's nothing wrong with feeling or  sensing emotion during a movie -- in fact, one should! I also prefered the  humor being kept to a minimum. Armageddon had too much of it.  Finally, the  scene of the astronaut reading to his injured comrade was sensitive and  touching.  Mushy?  NOT!
B00000DFTG|4.0|After three previous live albums that all left something to be desired, Reunion finally gives die-hards like myself what we've been waiting for.      Except for the blasphemous exclusion of any material from the Sabotage  album, this live set should cover Sabbath's Ozzy Osbourne era to the  satisfaction of all fans.      The two new studio tracks, however, are  another story, and cost the album a star IMO.  Again, though, any fan of  Sabbath and/or Ozzy should find the live set well worth the money spent.
B000002KDG|5.0|Plenty of harmonica that Young is famous for.  This is a very good lyric album, that has  the first half of the album in the feeling of an intimate coffee-house setting. &quot;Ride my llama&quot; is in the style that Young  really shines: you can  picture him performing this almost sitting on a   bar stool. The first half of this album is probably about the most  laid-back of any of the Neil Young albums that you'll find since  &quot;Tonight's the Night.&quot;  This is the album that coined the phrase  &quot;It is better to burn out, than fade away&quot; - How true it is.  I  have 28 Neil Young recordings. and this is one of my favorites.
0399143904|2.0|Rainbow Six is a good read, but the plot is preposterous.  It seems that in each novel he writes Clancy increases the level of villany of the bad guys. In his latest creation, Clancy has his very, very bad guys outdoing  Hitler in genocidal madness.  What evil is he going to invent for an  encore?<br />And then there are the good guys.  They are oh so perfect -- and  so one dimensional.  John Clark is superb at what he does, but he is a  total bore.  Beyond his ability to smash terrorists, there is nothing else  to this character.  Ding Chavez is a Latino version of Clark -- all macho,  but with one additional characteristic.  He likes fatherhood.  Clancy loves  these military folks, but it is interesting that they are so devoted to  family values.  No fooling around in Clancy's world, no sex at all  actually, even between man and wife. Every member of the RS team is  married, has kids (but no sex), and is a devoted father.  Maybe Clancy  should have titled this one, &quot;Father Knows Everything.&quot;<br />Really,  the most interesting character was the former KGB agent, Popov, who  combined the good with the bad.  He is a bit more complex, and for this  reason, I would be surprised to see him reincarnated in Clancy's next  novel.  But it would be a good idea.  Along with other readers, I would  recommend waiting for the paperback.  RS is an OK book but not worth the  hardcover price.
B000002BE9|5.0|I love this cd so much. When I listen to it, it makes me feel relaxed (but not depressed!). She has so much real meaning to the songs, none of them are phony songs about how she wants to get with some guy because he's fine.  And she's not what people say she is, she speaks her mind and it speaks the  truth. This is the first album I have ever owned where I love every song.
B00000G3PA|5.0|At first it seemed another testosterone junkie action flick. However, to my surprise it was very edge of the seat action, mixed in with lighthearted humor. The actors portrayed the meteor as the arrival of the pizza delivery  boy. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes mass destruction special  effects like those seen in Independance Day.
0887306667|5.0|As a marketing novice directing a start-up, I found the book immensely readable and practical.  Some of it is intuitive and some can save you a lot of money and time. I wish it had been out when I was starting.<br />RWK  San Clemente, CA
B000002NJM|5.0|This cd has been in my cd player for over a year now, and I love it. My favorite songs are Holy Matrimony , Long Time Woman by Pam Grier herself, Across 110th Street, Inside my Love, Midnight Confessions......well I'm  naming them all, so that should give you an idea of how good this cd is.   If that isn't enough to convince you, let me tell you     the photo of  Quentin Tarantino inside the liner notes is just the stuff dreams are made  of. I got my money's worth just for that picture of him!
6305265488|5.0|&quot;Ever After&quot; is the best fairy tale I have seen in my entire life!  I especially liked the fact that it was portrayed in a more realistic way and did away with singing mice and a pumpkin carriage.  There  was a lot of humor and very heart-wrenching scenes (i.e. when the old  servant returns to his wife and home.)  When you see this movie, make sure  you have a box of clenex ready!
1573226521|1.0|My little brother recommended this to me and I'm going to have to turn his flat over looking for the crackpipe because this book is horrible. Longwinded and clumsily written (the insertion of the Gameboy had to be a  hasty pop-culture filler as the need to shop for batteries on the mainland  completeley dilutes the semi-ceremonial aspects of the &quot;rice  run&quot;).  What a disappointing book.  Does any generation need a single  literary voice to emerge?  If they do should we be stuck with Garland?  One  positive: it's inspired us all to find some shaky premise and wring a  &quot;novel&quot; out of it.  Oh, as for the denoument -- was the hard  drive running short of memory or was the handily rapid carnage supposed to  suggest the flitting nature of life? Good grief.
630521610X|4.0|This is the best slasher movie to come out in a long time.  The acting is great, the story is full of twists, we never know who the killer really is (always questioning), and it will scare the crap out of you, especially  with the great sound the DVD provides.  The bonus materials (especially the  commentary) are nice as well.
0670880728|2.0|This book was not funny, although the author tried desperately to make it so.  It was an OK read at best.  I do not recommend it to anyone.
6302732786|5.0|Dear Friends, This is the Musical Video Cassette, that you dont want to miss to put it under your Collection. It is the Best Musical Video Cassette i have ever watched. This is the Tribute, to the Unforgotten Rock star  Freddie Mercury. Including all the other Rock Stars performing on stage to  Freddie Mercurys memory. I bought this Video, and i am very thankfull to  the Amazon giving me this chance, and i recemmend all of you to try the  same thing too, Because believe me this Video is really Rare, so have it  now, before it is all gone.    And enjoy to watch Freddie Mercurys Tribute.
0440219078|5.0|I just graduated from college with a degree in Elementary Education.  I read this book to see what type of literature upper level readers would read.  I did not know that I was going to read such a wonderful piece of  work.  This book is so touching.  When the reader finds out the secrets of  such things as the releasing and who The Giver's daughter is, one will be  surprised.  There are twists an amazing surprises on each page.  Lowry has  got a brilliant mind!   I would also recommend &quot;Number the  Stars.&quot;
0790735431|5.0|Cornball scripts? No way! It portrays the &quot;superstitious&quot; nature of aviators then and now. Trust me, when was the last time you flew in a commuter airplane in heavy turbulence. And during a bombing a run into the  heart of Germany without fighter escort and flying like &quot;sitting  ducks&quot;, you will take out all the lucky charms you ever had since you  were a kid. Accurate portray of a bomber flight crew and the political  garbage that goes on during a war. As far as using &quot;permission&quot;  clips, what is wrong with that! Just make the movie more creditable. Love  to see the Maltin's reviews of the Cameron's Titanic movie with the actual  video clips of the ship. In fact, Professional Wall Street traders/brokers  is also heavy into superstition. Closing the Stock market on Good Friday. I  would seriously question the reviews in Mr.Leonard Maltin's Movie &amp;  Video Guide and question the value of his book. At bet he may be reviewing  your wallet!
B000002J20|4.0|I first listened to the entire work in the summer of 1976.  Not a month has passed since that time when I've played at least one track.<br />The music is so rich with YES creativity and brilliance.  Could any musician get away  with recording such a magical monster in 1999? I don't think so.  It's  obvious that these wonderful musicians were given &quot;free reign&quot; to  record whatever they wanted.  I consider this Yes's best collection since  they really didn't care what the record company or the critics said.<br />By  the way, my favorite piece is The Ancient - first piece - fast vibraphones  and wailing guitar!<br />My only criticism is the production.  The sound of  the entire collection is not as clear as Close to the Edge or Relayer.   Even the remastered CD lacks the quality sound that most Yes recordings  contain.<br />My only regret in life is missing the 1974 Tales tour - all four  pieces and Close to the Edge in one concert.  I can only imagine...
0425129586|5.0|Not only my first Christie novel, but my first mystery at all, &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; introduced me to the world of murder over twenty years ago.  Since then I have enjoyed numerous wonderful mysterys, not one of  which even came close to rivaling Dame Agatha's gift to the world.  Truly  the #1 classic mystery of all time, one you will enjoy time and time again.  You haven't lived until you have experienced &quot;Ten Little  Indians!&quot;
B000002J1B|4.0|This was the first Yes album released after I became hooked to the band in 1974.  At the time I was physically depressed with the departure of Wakeman so I did not like the album.  <br />It took some time, but over the years I  got over my Wakeman fever and learned to love this masterpiece.  The battle  piece is extemely well rehearsed and composed.  It may sound like a bunch  of noise to the average listener, but after repeated plays, the music is  meticulously planned. Moraz' keyboard work is creative and full of  life.<br />I still look forward to the day when Rick plays the entire song in  concert.  Will that day ever come? We can only hope.
B000000OSG|5.0|In my opinion, this CD is better than Use Your Illusion I.  I think (for most people) that the main reason UYI I is supposed to be better is that it has thier two most played songs, and commercially acceptable songs,  included on them, which are November Rain, and the original Don't Cry.   These are good songs but the rest of the first one doesn't please me all in  all as well as the second.
B000006045|5.0|I think that MEZANINE is a great creation, some times transport me (back in time, remember me the Pink Floyd of Arnold Lane or the progressive Crimson....), but always with a proper personality a well defined  body.<br />Is a great piece of music (all the album), I strongly recommend  following Massive Attack
6304675348|5.0|I have never wanted to watch scary movies, but my best friend got me to watch it and I LOVED IT!  Scream is a funny movie as well as scary.  I for one couldn't figure out who the killer was throughout the whole movie!  I  never would have guessed one of the killers though (if you've seen the  movie you probably know which one I mean).  The first part is pretty gory,  but I still liked it.  SCREAM has got me hooked on scary movies!
6305177473|5.0|The new Parent Trap is much better than the original virsion. The Actors are much better, there is a lot more humor and there is so much more adventure. The story is basically the same, but the New version really has  a lot more details. You would love it!
B000002MP2|5.0|As the biggest Green Day fan around, it's hard for me to pick just a few aspects of this CD to discuss.  When I listen to &quot;Dookie&quot;, I know that I am not alone with my feelings of anger and distaste for the world.   My favorite track is &quot;She&quot;, in which the group tells the story of  a loved one who is always trapped inside herself.  Other great tracks  include &quot;FOD&quot;, &quot;Welcome to Paradise&quot;, and  &quot;Longview&quot;.
6305128952|4.0|I would compare this story to Bridges of Madison County.  A little slow but nice story line, about a stressed out lady from NY going to Montana. She learns to slow down and enjoy the beauty around her and she stays  faithful to her family. She listened to her head instead of her heart.
B000002MU3|4.0|Contrary to a lot of REM fans' beliefs, I feel that this ranks among the best of REM's albums.  This album is extemely electric, literally.  When you get past the over-played radio songs such as &quot;What's the  Frequency, Kenneth?&quot;  and &quot;Bang and Blame,&quot; the album  actually captivates you with electric-guitar ballads such as &quot;Crush  With Eyeliner&quot; and &quot;King of Comedy.&quot;
0790737345|5.0|This movie makes you realize, you need to slow down in this fast pace world. It really touches you down deep, even the guys enjoyed it.
B00000FCBC|4.0|I wasn't terribly impressed with the first disc.  \\"Die, Die, My Darling\\", \\"Astronomy\\" and \\"Whiskey in a Jar\\" were the only standouts, in my opinion, although it WAS just my first listen that I'm basing it on.  But I applaud  the second disc and I think it's worth the price of the whole package just  to have the second disc (even though I didn't pay for it).  I've been  waiting for Metallica to put all their covers on one disc and they've  finally done it.  All those great covers are included from the ultimate  cover anthem \\"Am I Evil?\\" (one of only two songs done with the late, great  Cliff Burton, by the way) to the rampaging cover of Queen's \\"Stone Cold  Crazy\\" and beyond (including the Motorhead stuff, which I haven't really  listened to yet, but anyway...) <br /> Even though the first disc isn't  terribly inspired (in my humble opinion) and sounds a bit too polished,  Garage Inc. is definitely worth getting for the second disc (but I said  that already so I'll shut up now...)
B000002UV9|5.0|to me becoming a huge Queensryche fan.  Although I was drawn into the whole scheme of things by mainstream hits such as Jet City Woman and Silent Lucidity, this album has allowed to explore different facets of musical  style that I could with no other album out there.  Songs range from the  passionate and protestant cries of Resistance all the way to the  melodramatic and jazzy character of Della Brown.  And stemming from my  association with this album led to my discovery of their gem Operation  Mindcrime, which still to this day earns my utmost respect.  All the talk  about mainstream this and sellout that doesn't really bother me, because I  bought this album and their others to listen to what they have to say, not  others.  Who cares what anyone else thinks?  Just get it, enjoy it, and  just be.
0784011796|5.0|A mesmerizing film that will capture and hold you in its grasp. A mixture of Euclid and Hitchock. A must for lovers of mathematics in our natural world and the possibilty of cyclic patterns in Nature and the world of high  finance and even religion. Acting and musical score will enthrall you and  not let you go. However, this is a film &quot;not for  everyone&quot;.....leave the minors and lovers of light film fare home to  watch &quot;Donald in MathamagicLand&quot;. Be prepared for a very  &quot;different film experience&quot;.
0767802659|1.0|You don't need a brain to watch this movie because it's too stupid. If they have Mike Myers to play the role 'Rico', I might give it two stars!!
6305252521|5.0|There is only one word to describe how I felt after watching Jim Carrey depart from comedy in The Truman Show(which is my favorite movie). WOW!!!!! Brilliantly acted, brilliantly scripted, and beautifully directed, this  daydream of a film is Oscar-worthy in every aspect. It'll leave you with a  good afternoon, good evening, and good night! Go Truman.
B00000DLUV|5.0|This CD is an excellent compilation of all of the BEE GEES songs. My favorite song is &quot;Tragedy&quot;.<br />I love the song &quot;Immortality&quot; performed by the Beegees and Celine Dion. <br />The CD  has got all the familiar songs with new songs as well that are very  pleasing to hear. Keep up the good work.
6305265488|5.0|Everyone has reasons why they enjoyed this movie, from Drew Barrymore's perfect role to Dougray Scott's believably spoiled, bored prince but as a reader of Leonardo DaVinci's notebooks and one who studies his life, I was  fascinated by the accurate depiction of his role in court life, and  particularly in costume making.  These are things I have not seen on screen  before, but they are there in the writings. History has never been so much  fun and the costumes are pure delight. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and  look forward to owning my own copy.
B00000DHTF|5.0|I just bought this CD last week and my CD player is smoking.  I simply can't stop listening to this.<br />Roulette just blasted me away the first time I heard it.  Brothers under the bridges (both versioins) left me  speachless.  I thought Rock 'n' Roll was dead.  Thank God, The Boss was  there to prove me wrong.<br />Some journalist (I can't remember his name) once  said that he had seen the future of R'n'R and its name was Bruce  Springsteen.  Bruce is not just the future of R'n'R, Bruce is the epitome  of Rock 'n' Roll.
0767802659|5.0|Starthip Troopers (the Novel) is a treasured memory of my youth.  Heinlein wrote a simplistic story with deep undertones about patriatism, duty to the state, and crime and punishment.  His book contains no triangular love  story, and actually very little combat.  It's a story of a boy coming of  age in a militiristic society.  Paul Voerhoeven's movie shares many traits  from the book.  The story is simplistic, but has many undertones and  subtelties.  He has bumped up the action from the book possibly BECAUSE of  his background as a child of World War II Holland.  His film beautifully  asks one simple question... Is this what you want?  Is this the world you  want to live in?  Blood and Gore are the tools of the common soldier, the  Grunt.  The book, and this film are about the common Grunt.  No elegance is  required.  Common soldiers aren't elegant people.  The film highlights the  youthful exhuberance of three highs school grads going into Federal  service.  This movie, and Heinlein's book are both about courage under  fire, duty, loyalty, and how war molds young men and women in different  ways.  Not for the squeemish, and those who have read the book should hit  the &quot;purge&quot; button before viewing for maximum enjoyment. The  missing high tech weapons from the Heinlein book would have been excellent,  but I understand why they are missing... maybe someday... Taken on it's  own, the movie is a powerful message, perhaps more powerful than Heinleins  original message in some ways.  I disagree with those who have commented  that the acting was bad.  The story goes by so fast it would be hard to  notice if it was.  But look for the highlights... Enjoy the sequence with  Carmen's arrival at, and first day driving the Rodger Young.  And the scene  with Michael Ironside seeing a swarm of thousands of bugs attacking a  makeshift outpost is priceless.  Like RoboCop, not everyone will get  &quot;it&quot;.  But watch it.  Note the polarity in comments here.  This  film is ART.  And Art makes you think.  The DVD is the best I currently  own. BAM
6301562925|2.0|I loved Parts 1,4,7 but I must say this one reached a low, the same low that part two did.  It has undertones of a &quot;jason&quot; type movie and the plot does not make sense when you think about it and also the  mysterious way they set up for a sequel was tacky. VERY tacky. The ending  was not brilliant, it was stupid, and involved unexplained characters  (circular reference to nonsensical plot).  Definitely not as good as 1, 4,  or 7 (H20). Watch it if like me, you must see every piece of drivel  associated with a long running story, but if you want a thriller  get  either 1 or 4, if you want closure get 7 (H20).
0767812417|5.0|This film has to be one of the most classical films ever made in the course of this century. It was an excellent summary of the book by Charles Dickens. The music and choreography were excellent and Moody was excellent  as the miserable and dejected Fagin.<br />Songs include &quot;You Gotta Pick a  Pocket or Two&quot; and &quot;Food Glorious Food.&quot;<br />These and every  other songs were absolutely brilliant and the acting was indeed  exceptionall.
B0000020C4|5.0|Colm Wilkinson is truly Phoenomenal. Philip Quast can easily be declared the best Javert the production has ever had. Micheal Ball...impeccable. His performance of empty chairs at empty tables inspires me. Philip Quasts  &quot;Stars' is truly the coolest piece in the production. Lea Solonga is  FINE!!! and her voice is Remarkable. The Thernardiers on the CD are so  funny!!!! The guy who did the part of Enjolras was pretty cool, but  personally, I think his voice was a bit naisely,when he sings the higher  notes, but no ones perfect. Awesome CD!!!!!!!
B00000FCBC|4.0|For a real Metallica fan the second disc is a waste of money, you probably own 95% of the material already (It is a Metallica sell-out for the &quot;Metalli-rookies,&quot; stuff previously released on earlier albums  and import singles).  For the new fan disc 2 will be a good addition to  your collection. Disc 1 shows their versatility as they cover everything  from southern rock to classic metal. By the way it is pronounced  &quot;Garage Incorporated,&quot; as in &quot;Damage, Inc.&quot; not  &quot;Garage Ink!&quot;
B000001EYO|5.0|This is yet another great soundtrack from the Coens. Quirky, but entirely suited to the film in every way. Burwell's original music is great and the rest is well chosen. The only fault with the soundtrack album is that it  doesnt contain all of the music from the film (most notably and  disappointingly, &quot;Tumblin' Tumbleweed&quot;) Otherwise, a top notch  soundtrack album. A must for any collection.
6304117752|4.0|This film was very good although I didn't really like some of the songs. The acting by Julie Andrews, as usuall, was excellent and exceptional as was all the other acting.<br />Songs include &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;  and &quot;Edelweiss&quot;<br />A sad and captivating movie on the whole
0374172897|5.0|I have not enjoyed a book this much since I read Lolita -- an undisputed triumph by another master stylist.  Mr. Cunningham's prose is spectacular  - a sublime mix of Woolfian stylistics with an individual voice that  harkens back to his heatbreakingly beautiful, Home At the End of the World.   I am also astonished by the magnificent sweep shown in a slim book that  presents only three June days, one in 1923, another in 1949, and the third  in the mid 1990s. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good  read!
B000002G6J|5.0|GREAT!!!!!!!
0812550706|5.0|I must say that this book is the BEST book I have ever read in my life. Mr.Card used up all of his imagination in this book because the other books in the series well...... just suck. But this book deserves 6 stars but  there is a limit so... if you can read, get this book. It's worth the price  no matter what version you get!
6304504012|5.0|The music in this video was exceptionall. Madonna was an excellent actor in this film and as usuall, Andrew Lloyd Webber was again behind the creation of this wonderful music.<br />I found the film very captivating of my  heart and it was also a very emotional film. I doubt if Andrew Lloyd Webber  will ever be replaced. This has to be one of the best musicals he ever  wrote for. Songs include &quot;Don't Cry for me Argentina&quot; and  &quot;Big Apple.&quot;<br />All songs: ***** Acting: ***** Music: ***** Theme:  *****<br />OVERALL:*****
6305171769|1.0|Maybe I missed something that the rest of these viewers saw.  Because I thought this was literally one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  It was not funny, it was TOTALLY predictable (even though I've never seen any  of the original Halloween movies), the plot was weak...and I didn't even go  into it expecting much!  If this is the best of the genre, I'll be giving  up horror movies.  Spend your money on something else!
630420065X|1.0|This movie really sucked! I would not classify it as being one of the best movies ever made. I found Tom Cruises acting abominable and degrading. His acting was an insult to the art of drama. <br />I found many faults with this  movie that I found hard to believe.<br />1. I did not like the different plots  in this film. Usually films have one single plot in them but this one just  kept dragging on and on.<br />2. What was this &quot;Mission:  Impossible&quot;. What exactly did it entail. Was it really a mission. At  the beginning, I know that Jim Phelps was given a mission to recover the  &quot;NOC. LIST&quot; but it just dragged on from then on.<br />3.Tom Cruise's  acting was terrible<br />4.The film was totally unrealistic and  mediocre.<br />5.It also made no sense<br />I would like to say, that if anybody  out there is willing to buy the Mission: Impossible video, I would  seriously reconsider. I can assure you that, since I got the movie, three  years ago, it has only been in my VCR once and has never gone in there  since. It is sitting on my shelf and gathering a ton of dust, I can assure  you.
0446604844|5.0|Best book I have read in yeas.  I place this novel one notch under &quot;The Firm&quot; by Grisham.  When it ends, you'll re-read the last two pages and be sad that the book has ended.  Good reviews on this author's  other 4 books.  New adventures never written about before.
0812550706|4.0|I am a 23 year old male in the United Sates Marine Corps.  Not that it makes a difference to the people outside the military but Ender's Game is on the Commandant's Reading List for Marines that are Corporal and  Sergeant.  I myself am a Lance Corporal.  I was first introduced to this  book from my OIC and she spoke highly of the book.  I decided to read the  book and found myself staying up until 2:00 and 3:00 in the morning.  I  also found that I was emotional to the way Ender was treated and I wished I  was there to help him.  I have had my dreams and nightmares being in the  military.  One of my most interesting dreams is one in which I am extremely  intelligent and nothing can throw me or stand in my way from achieving  greatness.  I aspire now to be like Ender.  Orson Scott Card is now on my  &quot;Authors to keep an eye on&quot; list.  This book comes highly  recommended from myself to you.
B000000WFU|5.0|I can't reccommend this CD enough. It is by far my favorite CD (except for Adiemus II) and I listen to it everyday. The best tracks would have to be &quot;Adiemus,&quot; &quot;Tintinnabulum,&quot; and &quot;Kayama,&quot; but  they are all great. Listen to this music when you are feeling sad and it  will lift your spirits. Buy this CD.
B00000BKDX|5.0|This album is the best live album recorded. It was in the best phase of Iron Maiden and it contains the best songs. I could see this personally in Rock in Rio. Bruce Dickinson performance is astonishing
6301934229|5.0|A must watch for all movie goers who enjoy movies about psychos and about suspense. Rutger as the hitcher makes your hair stand on end. The student who he chases and frames keeps getting deeper and deeper into the trap and  is saved at the end by an understanding cop. A must for any serious watcher  of action or thriller movies - I vote it far better than 'The Run'
6300151379|5.0|I saw this movie as a sneak preview lead-in for another movie that I wanted to see in that theater. I cannot even remember the name of the movie that I originally intended to see, but I have not, nor will I ever forget  the magic of Labyrinth. I bought the movie as soon as it came on the  market, and all of my kids know the dialog by heart. My copy has  disappeared into thin air, and I have been looking for it for several  years. I recently found it at auction; it is bringing big bucks for each  copy, but it is money well spent. When I finally get my copy,I will keep it  under lock and key. There are only a VERY FEW movies that I would rate as  5-star, but this is definitely one. Please, please,PLEASE reprint this  movie. I will buy ten copies immediately.
6305265488|5.0|I saw this movie several times and thoroughly enjoyed it!!  This was one of the best movie's that I saw and Drew Barrymore was an outstanding heroine.  Anjelica Houston played her part to the tee and the plot flowed  evenly.  Dougray Scott... What can I say about him.  If I were to have a  prince charming, He would be it!! This movie was beautiful and was the  escape from reality that I really enjoyed!!!! I can't wait for this movie  to be out on video, I will never loan my copy out!!!
6304539282|5.0|What can you say about the Star Wars Trilogy that's not good? It's the best thing ever done in film! In this Special Edition you can see better some of the goofs, but others have been corrected, like Obi-Wan's light  saber going white in the final duel with Vader. I love to catch the goofs  in these films! They're *not quite* perfect, you know? But still the  best...
B000000OPU|5.0|To say this album is excellent does not do it justice. ALL the songs are excellent, whether they were &quot;hits&quot; or not. This is arguably Peter Gabriel's best album, and undeniably one of the greatest albums of  all time, right up there with Sgt. Pepper, Abbey Road, Dark Side of the  Moon, Band On the Run, Exile on Main Street, Rumours, et al. This record  (yes, I mean vinyl) was permanently on my turntable during my senior year  in college in 1986, shortly after its release. I never got tired of  listening to it. I later bought the CD but still have the vinyl record.  Thirteen years later, the music on the CD still sounds as incredible as it  did on the record back in 1986.  A Classic in every sense of the word.
1573226521|2.0|This book is bound to be passed around by backpackers (hopefully none will buy another copy).  I gave mine away as soon as I finished and have not considered the plot or the characters since I turned the last page. Read it  while you are stuck on a train and you will be happy.
B0000057C5|1.0|Who would want an German cd. I wouldn't! Du Hast is at the edge of being ok! It is almost a bad song. But I do like the gutair sounds in Du Hast. Gotta be crazy to buy it!
B000003S5H|5.0|Nothing new but those one hit wonderbands on your alternative stations? Rap annoy you? Classic rock is just..old? Techno getting to ya? Heres a band that combines a little jazz, a little techno, and a lot of slow,  dreamy, relaxing tunes that are just amazing. Ive passed this cd on to many  friends and family, and theyve all loved it. Highly recommend..Tracks 1,3,4  are amazing..the rest is &quot;merely&quot; fantastic. GO BUY IT NOW
B000009PNY|4.0|I heard this cd at a friends house and knew I had to get it.  The best remakes are &quot;fly on a windscreen&quot; by god lives underwater and also &quot;Upon the Silence&quot; by Failure.  Very emotional songs!  I  actually like their versions better than Depeche Modes'.
0446347949|5.0|Simple. Concrete. One of the most influencial books Ive ever read about brands.
0385484518|5.0|A timeless book.  It has meaning for every generation and for all time.  It knows no bounds, culturally or geographically.  The truth of his words is true in all the corners of the universe as well as our meager world.
0782008372|1.0|The package quite clearly labels this as &quot;Digitally Mastered for Superior Sound and PICTURE Quality&quot;. HAH! The picture on this DVD is the worst I've seen on any sell-through product - YES, VHS included. I've  seen clearer freeze-frames on a ten year old rental tape. Absolute waste of  money. I only hope that (A) I can get my money back, and (B) the studio  recalls these rejects and redistributes a product of the quality deserved  by this great film &lt;&lt;dusts off VCR deck&gt;&gt;
6305013578|1.0|Unwatchable quality.  Mutilaton of a great film
B000004286|5.0|&quot;Braveheart&quot; is,in my opinion,the best film ever made.And this is the best soundtrack ever.Thank you so much James Horner,i am a very a big fan of you.
6300214559|5.0|Tells the story of a young woman forced into a role she didn't want, but tries to do what is best for her people.  Lady Jane died because she would not forsake her beliefs.  This movie proves that a movie CAN be  historically accurate and still be entertaining.  The industry needs to  take note.
B000000XCH|4.0|Four stars or five? I ended ud with four because of the long and weird opening track, &quot;Ramble Tamble&quot;, and some not very interesting renditions of &quot;Ooby Dooby&quot; and Arthur Crudup's &quot;My Baby Left  Me&quot;, but the rest of the album (which contains 11 songs) is just  wonderful. &quot;Cosmo's Factory&quot; is highlighted by the anti-war  folk-rocker &quot;Who'll Stop The Rain&quot;, the soulful &quot;Long As I  Can See The Light&quot; and John Fogerty's Little Richard-pastiche  &quot;Travelin' Band&quot;, as well as an 11-minute rendition of the  classic &quot;I Heard It Through The Grapevine&quot;. This was CCR's best  selling album, and  while you're looking for the one that has &quot;Proud  Mary&quot; on it (that would be &quot;Bayou Country&quot;), or perhaps the  one with &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot; (the &quot;Green River&quot; album),  pick up this one as well. It's a classic.
B00000G3PA|5.0|I'm fairly new to DVD, so I was anxious to watch Armageddon which just arrived yesterday.  The Dolby Digital 5.1 Audio was terrific.  I also enjoyed the Aerosmith Music Video included in the extras.  I don't like it  when the DVD starts playing immediately when you put it into the player.   This is one that does.  I prefer to get a menu first so that I can check  the A/V setup.<br />One scene bugs me a bit. The one where AJ has been fired  and some 2 or 3 days later he's already the owner of his own business.  Not  very plausible.  I think the story in &quot;Deep Impact&quot; was better,  but Armageddon is a lot more fun.
B000002UWF|5.0|This was my first introduction to swing, and I love it! Our whole family enjoys it, especially my 17-month old! Great fun!
6305229449|5.0|I am so impressed to Disney that put Asian story on its production. This makes Disneys appreciation to Asian people. Hopefuly, Disneys will take the other story from the other Asia region.
0380789019|4.0|This is the first Gaiman work I've read to date, and I was not disappointed.  A very free-flowing story that unravels with interesting, although not fully-developed characters.  The characters are not as  important as the tapestry of London Below, which comes alive with Gaiman's  well-contrived imagination.  We have just as much fun as Mr. Croup and Mr.  Vandemar, two characters best to be avoided in a dark alley, as we do with  Richard Mayhew, newcomer to a world so different from his own.  Gaiman has  ample opportunity to return to Neverwhere in future works, and this is a  great first book.
B000002GGO|5.0|I have all their albums (including their most recent one which is available only on import).  &quot;Sparkle In The Rain&quot; is their best one ever!  All ten songs have the hard-hitting intensity and passion the  Minds have always delivered.  The most outstanding track on this album is  &quot;Waterfront&quot;.
6305171769|5.0|Curtis, et all do a wonderful job taking us all back to 1978,where it all began and make the 1998 connection very plausible. It is an excellent movie that should not be missed by ANY of the Halloween fans. I am sure that  along the way, this movie will encite others who have not viewed the others  to do so. I will not divulge any of the particulars in the movie because I  feel that it is a must-see and should be viewed without any preconcieved  notions given by others. I hope that everyone who is a fan of the genre  will get a chance to see this wonderful cinematic masterpiece. The only  drawback in my opinion is that is was too short. But, it was excellent! :-)
0441172717|5.0|I initially wrote a review for this over ten years ago, but as one might expect not yet out of his teen years, it wasn't the most eloquent or insightful examination of the book. Not that I expect this will be either,--and besides, what more can be said after nearly fifty years and over a thousand customer reviews?--but I felt that it was a book that deserved better.<br /><br />I first became aware of Dune in the mid-'80s (when I was around five years old) due to the film by David Lynch. I did not see this film when it came out because my parents had heard bad things from a friend. A few years later, the extended version played on television, and I tried to watch it, but I quickly grew confused and, during a scene with the Baron, a bit disgusted, so I gave up.* Still, there was something I found fascinating about the universe in which the story took place, so a few years after that--at the age of thirteen--when I saw the book on the shelf at my local library, I decided to give it a shot. I was immediately sucked in by Frank Herbert's work, and Dune became the first book I'd ever read to truly blow my mind. When I'd finished, I knew immediately that I'd just read my favorite book of all time.<br /><br />It's amazing that Dune is still my favorite book. I've reread it several times, and over the years, I've come to realize just how little it's aged. In fact, I would say that it's only grown more relevant as our country has escalated its involvement in the Middle East (or West Asia, if you prefer). To tell you the truth, these issues weren't things I really thought about those first few times I read it, but it's been pretty much impossible not to in recent days.<br /><br />Allegory aside, it's otherwise a cracking good read. Frank Herbert establishes a meticulously thought out universe populated with wonderful characters (of which there are many). This is truly a book one can live in for a while. It may not have the sprawling page count of, say, The Lord of the Rings or War and Peace, but it definitely has the epic scope.<br /><br />*I did eventually end up watching both the theatrical and extended cuts of the 1984 film. While I really enjoy the look of the film, I don't think it's a particularly good adaptation. (However, I do think that some of that is due to the way it's put together. If someone could go back to the raw footage, I'm sure it'd be possible to make a really good film out of it.) And while the 2000 Sci-Fi Channel mini-series is a better adaptation, it's not very good otherwise. I can only hope that the supposedly upcoming feature film will be the one that sticks it, but I'm unsure if any studio will be okay with making a movie in which the hero essentially becomes a religious terrorist.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: Frank Herbert's Dune is one of the few books I have read more than once.  While it's not the easiest book to read, it is one of the most gripping tales of science-fantasy I have ever read.  I recommend this novel to all  lovers of sci-fi.efinitely has the epic scope.    *I did eventually end up watching both the theatrical and extended cuts of the 1984 film.

6305177473|5.0|I saw this movie in my flight back from Honolulu. Since I was with my two-year old son, I watched it as a silent movie without headset. Even though I enjoyed the movie very much. As soon as we got home, I ran into  Blockbuster and bought one home. Since then, I couldn't remember how many  times my wife and I have watched the video. It's the kind of movie you want  to see again, again and again .

1559408758|5.0|This Is Spinal Tap, The Collector's edition, offers the best of what the DVD medium is intended to deliver.  More than a film, it is an interactive viewing experience.  The inclusion of directorial and &quot;Tap&quot;  comments as well as hours of interactive additional footage and commentary  brings the &quot;Tap&quot; experience to life...bigger and badder than  ever.
0792151712|5.0|What is there to say about it?  Awesome movie; great actors.  Great overall movie.  Really good special effects.  Could have been a little shorter, but all in all it was great!  Really good tear-jerker.
0609603086|1.0|I had truly hoped this book would be better than the awful &quot;The 3RD Twin&quot;, but I was wrong. This book was definitely written for a movie of the week. If you want to read Follet at his finest, try &quot;A  Dangerous Fortune&quot;, &quot;Lie Down With Lions&quot;, &quot;Pillars of  the Earth&quot; or anything before &quot;The 3rd Twin&quot;.  Let's hope  Follet gets off his duff and starts exhibiting the brillance of his  earliers works!
6305169187|1.0|The movie had a pretty good plotline.  Astroid about to blow up earth, government blows up astroid at last minute.  Sounds good.  It would have been good if this plot had been complemented by special effects.  Instead,  it was more like the special effects were complemented by the plotline!  They just about made up the entire movie.  There was probably about 45  minutes of movie there, but a ton of junk was added.  You spent the first  half of the movie wishing the drillers would get off the ground, and the  second half wishing they'd get back on it!
B000002BBY|5.0|This has to be one of the best CDs I've ever heard.  The melodies are great, and Liam's voice is more singing than sneering, unlike Definitely Maybe.  Champagne Supernova is a stroke of genius, although maybe a little  long, and Morning Glory always gets me going.  This CD makes Oasis one of  the best bands of the '90s.  In an age of street punks rapping about  &quot;da hood&quot; and teen girls going crazy over 18 year olds who can't  sing or write songs, it's good to know that at least one band is dedicated  to true rock.
6304240554|5.0|You'll like this.  Four people including a reporter, a helicopter pilot, and two S.W.A.T. team members seek shelter in a shopping mall when most of the world turns into flesh eating zombies.  You'll laugh, get grossed out,  then laugh again.  If you liked &quot;Night of the living dead&quot; you'll  like this, although this has more laughs.  Both directed by George Romero.   Look for &quot;Day of the Dead&quot; also.
0790735199|5.0|This 25th anniversary release adds significantly to the Bruce Lee legacy, including interviews with the actor which crystalize his intensity and passion for martial arts and film. An interview with his surviving wife  introduces the additional footage that was included in this edition but not  in the screen version.  It enlarges on Bruce's philosophical bent on the  martial arts. The video is technically clean and even includes the preview  spots that were shown in theaters prior to release. This video is a Must  Buy for all Bruce Lee enthusiasts or interested individuals who wonder why  he was so popular, and why his passing was such a blow to the Martial Arts  entertainment world.  One can only imagine what these movies would be like  today had he lived.
0783229526|5.0|Absolut talent from Gilliam managing a incredible performance from Depp and Del Toro
B000002MQ9|5.0|You don't just listen to this stuff... it insinuates itself into the grey area between your ears,  and then refuses to leave...  Haunting.  Think of it as the musical equivilent to &quot;The Raven&quot;.<br />There is a scene  in &quot;I.F. Stone's Weekly&quot; which captures an intensely beautiful  version of &quot;Kyrie&quot;,  sung by a military choir.  As their voices  swell,  the film cuts to stock footage of a  Vietnamese hamlet in the  process of being napalmed.  As the somber and extraordinary music crests  one sees the explosions from the vantage point of the helicopters.  It is  simultaneously a stunning and horrific vision - the horror of which is  underlined by the sombre liturgical score.<br />This CD is a lot like that.  &quot;Summoning of the Muse&quot; and &quot;Persephone&quot; in particular  give rise to a sense of foreboding which stays with you,  (and probably  makes you insufferable to everyone else),  for the rest of the day.  If you  suffer from chronic depression,  then you probably should give this CD a  pass,  and try out some Delta Blues.<br />Otherwise,  find a dark and drafty  room, light the candles and incense,  throw on the CD,  pick up Poe or  Kafka,  and let 'er rip.
0061091669|1.0|A most abusive writer who filled his bio with blatent lies about persons who knew MM &amp; loved her.In doing so, he filled his book with misinformation and virtual heresay to his own delight and did not include  so-called &quot;documents&quot; or any other &quot;proof&quot; of claims he  made. Claims made by this biographer do not make it the truth. What you are  reading here are only the   allegations made by Spoto stated as  &quot;fact&quot; and &quot;words&quot; or &quot;heresay&quot; by persons  bitter toward MM's memory who did not REALLY know her well OR AT ALL. Info  that would have been enlightening &amp; truthful, was PURPOSELY deleted  from this book. This was an obvious effort to discredit other authors as  well as Robert Slatzer &amp; the tireless efforts he has made to bring the  truth of Marilyn's life and death to light. Persons who knew her well know  that she was a delightful, creative, loving &amp; generous person who had  the unfortunate habit of surrounding herself with a lot of people who only  used her to make money or for their own personal reasons. Misinformation   Spoto put in his book included, lying about Bebe Goddard (She's misquoted),  Doc Goddard (Doc did not molest Norma Jeane), Gladys Baker (hearsay tales  do not make a woman a tramp) &amp; others. Spoto also claims MM had  appointment with Mama Jean Bellos, Jean Harlow's mom, but alas Donald, she  died years before. This information could have easily been verified by  Spoto had he even bothered to check Jean Bellos's death certificate, &amp;  is also found in libraries &amp; in Bio's on Jean Harlow! According to Pat  Newcomb, she in fact, WAS NOT A CLOSE FRIEND OF MM. She WAS an  EMPLOYEE/FRIEND who did spend time with MM but WAS NOT A CLOSE  'CONFIDANTE'of Marilyn's. Evelyn Moriarity's relationship with MM is  overstated. Spoto Was in fact sued by Tony Summers &amp; others for libel.  Why bother with rehashed material, gossip &amp; lies. This author attempted  to Put RFK on a pedestal where he does not belong. The  discrediting of  others including MM makes for poor reading material &amp; a terrible waste  of young minds. This tome was about total self-gratification &amp; only  serves to glorify the author &amp; his so-called &quot;followers&quot;.  Read Donald Wolfe's, &quot;The Last Days Of Marilyn Monroe&quot;, or  &quot;Goddess&quot;, if you can't find a copy of the Robert Slatzer effort;  &quot;The Life &amp; Curious Death Of Marilyn Monroe&quot;, published in  1974.   Publisher's were more cautious about what they printed back then  &amp; authors wrote about their subjects &amp; did not rely on the trashing  of other authors or the loved ones, or relatives of their subject. Spoto   included persons as so-called &quot;authorities&quot; on this subject who  pacified his own needs and provided him with this concoction of  misinformation.  Shame on you Donald Spoto for what you did to MM's memory  &amp; the memory of her mother, foster sister, real friends and loved ones.   Donald Spoto has shown total disrespect for his subject and the memories  of those who cared and still care about Norma Jeane Mortenson, aka, The  Late Marilyn Monroe. Reckless disregard for the truth in Journalism should  never be encouraged.
6302293553|5.0|This is the funniest or the second funniest movie i have ever seen the funniest being Monty Python ...And Now For Something Completely Different.  This combines the funniest humor about the way we used to think way way  back in the day and it also shows how funny a simple thing as removing dead  people from towns can be!!!  I love this movie!!!
0783229526|4.0|this film idealizes nothing. the characters are confused, grotesque and completely incoherent... except for the subtle moments of brilliance uttered by R. Duke in profound moments of clarity. if that doesn't sound  appealing to you, don't see this movie... you won't understand or enjoy it.  in my opinion, it's worth seeing for Depp's performance alone.
6305171769|4.0|Hmmm...what can I say...it was good once it got going...I think that Jamie Lee and the cast did a bang up job, portraying their charectors. It could have had a little more action to it though. All in all it was great!
0783229100|5.0|Paul Newman and Robert Redford play the Robin Hoods of the 1930s.  They rob from the rich and give to the poor--themselves!  This movie keeps your attention the whole way through with animated and believable characters as  well as a complex, suspense filled in most parts and humorous in all parts  screen play.  If you haven't seen it, you don't know what you're missing!
0380789019|5.0|I know the Douglas Adams comparison is fairly obvious, but this English stranger in a strange land is a more decisive and layered non-hero...Richard feels less like a man always playing the fool, and more like an average, reasonably intelligent person trying not to look stupid when he finds himself in a world that is clearly out of his depths. The novel's sharp, dry wit crackles, and the narrative's insightfulness takes on a decidely less juvenile nature than Adams' Hitchhiker Trilogy, without losing any of the whimsy. Gaiman has obviously thought out more of this world than is revealed here, and has left plenty of room to develop the stories further, as one can only hope he shall. This is one of those books that you read in snatches for a few days, until one night you find yourself caught, reading far past your bedtime and into the waning hours of morning, knowing your alarm is about to go off for work, but still unable to break free of the spell. Every glimpse into the minds of the supporting characters leaves you yearning to know them better, and every allusion to a new facet of life in the shadow-realm of the London Underground leaves you hungering to explore deeper.
6304466498|5.0|I love Spaceballs.  It is my favorite movie and if you haven't seen it buy it right now.  Or rent it.  It parodys all alien and space movies such as Star Trek, Star Wars, and Alien.  WATCH THIS MOVIE NOW!!!
6305263248|5.0|Unlike some moves you get a sense of realism, the car chase scenes are excellently choreographed, and the movie is fairly clean of vulgarity and sexuality which makes it a great clean action movie.

0886461308|5.0|This is the author's masterpiece, a moving, funny, and sad novel that touched me deeply with its rich beauty and simple truth.  The personal experiences of the author's war service are made vivid and real through the  use of fantasy and become a reflection of the life journey of all of us.  I  envy those who discover this treasure for the first time and only wish each  the same joyous reading experience that I had long ago.

0767800958|5.0|Director Sally Potter, who gave us the brilliant &quot;Orlando, turns the camera on herself to give an intimate and often wrenching performance. Potter plays herself, a frustrated director desperately trying to finish a  script she has no faith in. On a research trip to Paris, she sees Veron  dancing the tango and instantly falls in love. She takes up the dance, and  the story follows her around the world as she learns the art of the tango.  The stunning camera work (shot mostly in black and white, but with haunting  colour images as Potter imagines her screenplay coming to life)is  breathtaking. There are so many moments of pleasure in this film: Potter  and Veron dancing the tango along the Seine in Paris, in the rain in  Argentina and in an abandoned barbershop. The soundtrack is a must as well.  A masterpiece.

6305265488|5.0|With a great cast, this movie is a magnificent version of Cinderella. <br />Drew's character provides a strong and wise role model for the perfect society. If only every one could live with her characters philosophy's what  a better world this would be.<br />The movie is set in France with a young  girl anticipating her father's return home with his new wife. The young  girl's father dies while the girl is only 8 and her step mother jealous of  the fathers love for the daughter punishes the daughter by making her a  servant. A typical Cinderella story you think! This is an inspirational  cinderella story shows a girl whom only trys to save the life of a simple  servant, and ends up stealing the heart of a prince.<br />I think this is a  must watch. I love it.
B000009CEM|5.0|Look, folks. There ain't but one way to describe this album. It's the best Fear Factory that's ever been released. period!!!!
0790737973|1.0|When I first heard that a film based on Michael Crichton's novel Sphere (for those of you who haven't read Crichton, this appears to be his most acclaimed book), I was very enthusiactic for I had read this book and loved  it.  When I heard that it would star Dustin Hoffman, Sharon Stone, and (one  of my favorite actors) Samuel L. Jackson and directed by Barry Levinson  (Rain Man, Disclosure), I was even more excited.  Then when I saw the  movie, I was a little disappointed, but not much.  However, the more and  more I thought about it, I realized that they had completely screwed up  what could have been one of the best sci-fi films in years.  What I think  really ruined it was that it seemed the screenwriter(s) wanted to make a  horror movie instead of the suspense/thriller it should have been.  Also,  quite frankly, little of the story made sense even to me as someone who has  read the book repeatedly.  My final thoughts: (1) you might enjoy this  movie if you haven't read the book and (2) I believe the fault of this  disaster falls on the screenwriter(s) for the poor script, not the  outstanding cast and their director.
6303160344|5.0|Juliette Binoche dominates the screen in this story of a woman who drastically changes her life after her husband, a famous composer, and their daughter are killed in a car crash. There are so many grace notes  here: The play of light over Binoche's face in several scenes, the hypnotic  blue of the swimming pool where she goes to forget her past, a sugar cube  soaking up coffee in a Paris cafe. And the musical score that drives the  film is nothing short of majestic. Kieslowski was working at the top of his  form when he made the Three Colours trilogy. He is talent is greatly  missed.
B000002KHH|5.0|Not only creating a genre of music which is adored by millions of fans, Black Sabbath also created a very worthy album with Paranoid. While their second album, this was the one that really started sending them places.
0790729636|4.0|Sure the plot and story were pretty bogus, but the tornados were the the main star of the show that people came to watch. The sound of these suckers was fantastic.
6305169187|4.0|This movie takes place at any given recent date.  Armegedon is supposed to be the end of the earth.  That is exactly what it is about. 14 United States, hand picked astronauts must go into space to destroy the meteorite.
0790736314|5.0|This film has awsome special effects in it. I was suprised on how good the movie was since it was made in the 70's. Very scary. I am glad I was watching it with friend, for if I didn't I would have been scared out of my  wits. If you like Horror films Buy this one!
B000002B49|5.0|What a change from the ordinary!  The music on this disc is full of life, rhythem, emotion, depth, and has a special quality that I can relate to.  Because it is the first time I have listened to music of this sort, I admit  that at first I found it odd and bizare.  BUT in under an hour it became  the most wonderful music have ever listened to!  It has a way of drawing  you in and, in some way, becoming a part of you to the point where you  can't immagine being without it.  My absolute favorite songs are  &quot;Bohemian ballet&quot;, &quot;Gathering&quot;, &quot;Twosome&quot; and  &quot;Cafe europa&quot;.  Their mood and power is beyond what I've  experienced through music before, and I know I will never tire of them!  I  like to daydream and imagine as much as possible, and the music on this  disc has added new depth and dimention to my imaginary escipades.  Surely  you, the reader of this will benefit the same way I have!
6305064490|5.0|We can all identify with James Stewart wish about not ever being born when things seem at their worse. This movie captures the simple town life, what it means to give, sacrifices, standing for principle, comedy, faith and  love that will constantly make it a Christmas classic. What a great way to  get into the Christmas spirit.
079073382X|5.0|There is a time that I hope we all experience that  is &quot;magical&quot; and perfect and that we always remember in a special place.  This movie captures that moment for these two characters.  The actors make it live for  us.  When you watch the movie be prepared to be drawn into it and to never  want that moment to end.
6305161992|4.0|The keys to a great action/martial arts movie is you need a great villain and believable heros. This movie did it right. Unfortunately it isn't widescreen format.
6302732778|5.0|I love, love, love this film. I feel careful thought was given to a plausible representation of a future culture. This is one of Harrison Ford's best roles. I adore the subdued lighting in this film. It's clean.I  actually prefer the original version w/ the asides.
0451151224|3.0|Not supernatural at all, but briefly psychological, like a number of his books.  I believe all Bachman books explored the human spirit to some degree, and this one offers the concept of love over life, and of course,  pride.  The world he sets is very gray, but his writing style has always  been light.  An easy read, one designed for the non-King fans.
B000002UTI|5.0|Add Cold Turkey (single version), Instant Karma, and a half-dozen others and this could have been THE definitive JL Best-Of collection.  <br />Real Love on this CD is NOT the one that was used for the new  &quot;Beatles&quot; single.
B000002ADT|5.0|This was one of the first albums I bought when I began my journey into jazz and it is still my favorite.  I listen to it more than any other album I own and I always hear something new in it.  This is definitely one of my  favorite recordings of all time (and is definitely Miles' best recording).   Buy this CD.
0399143904|2.0|Experienced readers have learned to avoid anything titled &quot;Tom Clancy's...&quot;, as it is often inferior work written partially by others.  So, with the hardback titled ''Tom Clancy - Rainbow Six'', I was  looking forward to more of the REAL Clancy.  Was I disappointed!  The novel  only barely reaches beyond the average X-Files serial book.  Absent are  Clancy's up-to-the-minute facts, figures and views on world - instead we  have a formula-written tome which does not offer anything to the  expectations of a usual Clancy fan.  I used to buy Clancy in blind faith -  I will check the reviews first from now on.  Please Tom, unless you really  need the money, can you sit down and put your heart and soul into another  masterpiece please?  Clancy fans will tolerate this book, as we are always  hungry for more.  But when you're expecting smoked salmon, fish and chips  (French fries!) are definitely a bit of a shock.  I've rated this book 2  out of 5 because Clancy can do better.  As a book in general, it is still 4  out of 5.  True Clancy fans will prefer to wait three years for another  masterpiece.  You set the standard Tom, please keep it up.
6305169187|1.0|If your under 16 and want to see a pretty good cast sink to purely commercial, low levels of achievement you've got to see this one.
B00000ADG2|5.0|I love this Cd and listen to it at least once a day.  Lauryn has an awesome voice, and it is very versatile.  She has great raps, wonderful slow songs, and a nice religious tint to some of them.  <br />My favorite song  is TO ZION because I think that her voice is the prettiest in this song.   It also reminds of the gospel in my church.  Then Superstar is my next  favorite.  Doo Wop is great but they play it too much.  Then Every Ghetto,  Every City, and finally Forgive Them Father.  Hey to Lauryn Hill: thanks a  billion for such a great Cd.  I can't stop diggin it.
B00000DGSN|5.0|Alongside Boston's first album, this album qualifies not only as a the reference album for serious rock fans but also as the ultimate album for live recordings. The quality, remember we are talking 1975 at the Budokan  in Japan, is still amazing. The experience as tightly knit band and  individual qualities expressed have yet to be surpassed in the world of  rock music. I grew up with music from this band (alongside that of Jimi  Hendrix) and I never tire of listening to this outstanding recording.
0449911357|5.0|What a wonderfully written story this was. I enjoyed it from start to finish. Fannie Flagg is a marvelous writer and really takes you into the lives of the characters as well as the surroundings.
0609603086|4.0|&quot;The Hammer of Eden&quot; is a domestic terrorist organization that claims it can cause earthquakes.  The story itself revolves around this group and spunky FBI agent Judy Maddox, who, in spite of the best efforts  of her incompetent, petty, chauvansitic boss, is charged with bringing them  down.  The action is fast-paced in this story after a slow and confusing  start.  The weakness of the book is its character development.  With the  possible exception of Preist, the main protagonist, the characters are  one-dimensional--either all bad or all good.  I really had a problem with  the relationship between Judy and Michael; there was precious little  interaction.  However, the story itself was a good one.  I'd recommend this  book to a friend.
0688002307|5.0|I read this book twenty years ago, and I still think about it.  That, to me, is the measure of a great book.  <br />Pirsig, of course, is writing on many levels, but the central theme is hinted at in the title.   &quot;Zen&quot; is all about experiencing things directly, immediately,  without a preconceived intellectual filter.  Zen Buddhism is very  anti-intellectual.  &quot;Motorcycle Maintenance&quot;, to be done well,  requires a deep conceptual understanding of how a motorcycle works, and a  scientific approach to trouble-shooting.  Pirsig is trying, with mixed  success, to reconcile what he calls &quot;romantic&quot; (immediate or  &quot;Eastern&quot;) thought with &quot;classical&quot; (scientific or  Western) thought.    <br />Pirsig believes that the reconciliation lies in a  deeper (pre-classical) understanding of &quot;quality&quot;.     Quality is  neither objective nor subjective, it is prior to them, it is the primordial  ether from which the objective/subjective dualism arises. (I do not do him  justice here, if you are interested, read the book.)<br />What makes the book  work is that it that style of writing is a labratory for the concepts he  his presenting.  <br />His prose is simple, almost poetic, when describing  what is around him and his relationships to his son and his past self.  His  honesty and directness are alternately refreshing and alarming.  Then he  shifts gears and tries to unravel and re-weave many of the core issues in  Western Philosophy.  He manages this without resorting to an academic style  or stuffiness.  <br />Pirsig, is a gifted thinker and writer, and certainly  not a conventional one.  He is a  philosopher in that he is working through   original ideas with courage and clarity.  In the end, like most true  philosophers, his philosophy is intertwined with a self-analysis and  catharsis, yet has broader meaning and applicability. <br />There are, I  presume, flaws in his reading of the ancients, and I think that his  conclusions rely to much on the multiple definitions of the word  &quot;quality&quot;.  The merit of his metaphysics should be discussed but  mostly I admire his grit, honesty and gumption to write such a text.  It is  those characteristics that I would most like to emulate.<br />I also recommend  the sequel, &quot;Lila&quot;.  It is more down to earth, but equally  couragous and fascinating.
0553212443|5.0|Filled with wit, humor, and grace, this is without a doubt the most famous and entertaining Christmas story ever.  Dickens frightens us one minute, involves us the next, humors us the next but never bores us.  If you liked  the book try and find the movie version with George C. Scott as Scrooge. I  think that's the best film.
0790739909|5.0|There  are plenty of movies that have made me cry, or take a different perspective on life, but City of Angels touched me.  I can't go into the produce section of the supermarket w/o thinking of Maggie's description of  how a pear tastes to her.  Yeah, the story was totally predictable, but the  acting was so great and the scenery and the music and...everything else  made up for it.  This is definitely one of my all time favorites!
B000002UJQ|5.0|The mood and depth of this album are far reaching.  Perhaps the best CD of the decade, OK Computer threatens musicians around the world with its sound, its eeriness, and its message.  At first, the album is difficult (if  not impossible) to listen to.  Climbing up the walls will make your skin  crawl.  No surprises will make you feel peace with the world.  Exit Music  might make you sick.  I can't put a finger on it.  It's just the most  frightening, incredible thing you'll ever hear.
6303430570|5.0|As a resident of New Jersey, i feel obligated to tell the world that this is a very accurate representation of Jersey life.  It's also friggin hilarious. I'm lovin the part with the old dead guy in the bathroom and  Dante's girlfriend. You know what i mean.
0380789019|5.0|If you buy this book for anything, buy it for Croup and Vandemar! These two are the most deliciously demented characters I have run across in a long time. I've never found villains quite so entertaining (although, I  must admit, in a dark and kind of horrific way) while being so very evilly  competent. I loved all their wry comments. Their only downfall was some of  the things they ate....
0812550706|5.0|I'm a 23 year-old English major, and not a reader of science-fiction.  This book was recommended to me by a friend who knew I hadn't  liked sci-fi I've read in the past. He assured me this book was  different. He was  right. I was impressed by the characterization,  especially the complex  relationships between siblings Ender, Valentine  and Peter.    Unlike most  popular fiction, here the characters and  their development drive the  story. There's alot more going on beneath its surface than most other  reviews  seem to indicate.I can't imagine anyone thinking this  book wasn't  worth the short time it takes to read. I read Ender's  Game in a few hours  and it left an impression on me for days.
B000000H57|5.0|Type o negative has come a long way from the comedic album Orgin of the Feces.  Although funny, Feces lacked the passion, it was Carnivore all over again.  Bloody Kisses came a bit further with passion but still had Feces  influence.  October Rust is the sound the band has searched for.  Rust is  beautiful and surreal and is a sound all to itself.  I can only hope Type  o's next album is this amazing.  This is a must have.  I have see Type O  Five times and they continue to be one of my all time favorites.
0312955006|4.0|Connelly's Harry Bosch is ultimate anti-hero.  A dark and deep character that evokes tremendous respect and sympathy.  I grab each new novel for an immediate read.
0964385619|5.0|I only wish the book was written years ago and that somebody sat me down and made me understand the book. I have always seemed to know these principles but they were never focused. Robert Kiyosaki has written the  &quot;HOLY GRAIL&quot; in the common persons' words!
B000002O5L|5.0|One of Petty's best!!!  A true classic
6300151379|5.0|This is a timeless movie showing the unique talents of Jim Henson and his puppets.  The interaction of Jennifer and David with the puppet stars is magical.  A must see for all ages.
B000002O1P|4.0|A mix of personal ballads and upbeat (almost disco-like) tunes such as &quot;It Ain't Nothing To Me&quot; and &quot;Make It Better&quot;. Songs like the title cut, &quot;Dogs On The Run&quot; and &quot;Rebels&quot;  focus on his southern roots. Throughout, Petty stays true to his lyrical  strength on this release.
B00000DHTF|5.0|This set proves that Bruce is a master of singing and songwriting.  It is amazing how Bruce and changed types of music over the years and some of these songs are better than the ones on the albums.  It is a well balanced  set, showcasing some very good ballads and rockers.   &quot;Thundercrack&quot;, &quot;Give the Girl a Kiss&quot;, &quot;I Wanna  Be With You&quot;and &quot;Pink Cadillac&quot; showcase Bruce's talent as  the Boss of rock and roll.  There are also many beautiful ballads-  &quot;Hearts of Stone&quot;, &quot;Good Man is Hard to Find&quot;,  &quot;Stolen Car&quot;, and &quot;Back in Your Arms&quot; are very good.   For any Bruce fan and anyone who wants to get to know Bruce, this is an  amazing musical experience.  I can't wait until the tour.
6302517052|4.0|see this movie if you enjoy horror and humor and excellent performances by all. the plot is basic attack by aliens but the quirky characters make this a great movie.
0684830515|5.0|Hemingway's writing style is naturally blunt and simple, which gives off a light weight aura that we can't let go of.  When you read his The Sun Also Rises, while his characters are trying to not tear each other to shreads  from stressing out, you are unstressful, it feels like you're on a beach  while reading this. <br /> The Sun Also Rises is an example of Hemingway at  the height of his ladder to sucess and fame, depicting a great portrait and  passion of his writing.  Delicate and peaceful, this is his best work of  all.
0440131480|5.0|This is an excellent book.  It runs a close second to his inspired &quot;Cat's Cradle.&quot; The book focuses on a used car salesman slowly going mad, Kilgore Trout, and Vonnegut himself.  The book sees the meeting  of author and his long-time character Trout. This book was supposed to be  Vonnegut's last.  Thankfully, it wasn't, it was just one of his best. JW
6305265488|5.0|Drew Barrymore was amazing in Ever After. It is a realistic verison of the animated Cindarella. A young women wo has been brought up as a worker girl, when her Stepmom and sisters get all the attention. This movie was great  for all ages I highly recommend it!!
B0000019PA|5.0|In the Aeroplane Over the Sea takes the listener on a journey through an amazing array of fantastic music and interesting, sometimes eerie, lyrics.  A must-own for any music fan.
B00000ADG2|5.0|This is a really wonderful CD! Lauryn Hill at her best! I was a fan of the Fugee's and it's great to see Lauryn back! BUY IT TODAY! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!
6304711905|4.0|According to INVENTING WYATT EARP by Allen Barra (Carroll and Graff, 1998), this is the most accurate retelling of the still controversial conflict between the Earp Brothers and the Clanton gang at Tombstone. The  Earps were neither saints nor sinners, but they were basically the good  guys in the riveting event that is most accurately, though less  felicitously, described as &quot;The Gunfight in the Vacant Lot behind the  O. K. Corral.&quot;  Doc Holliday, perhaps the most intriguing personality  in the old west, is said to be accurately portrayed by Val Kilmer.
6301963717|5.0|You'll get a lot of arguments about the best gangster movie of all time, but there's no doubt that &quot;Miller's Crossing&quot; is the most cerebral.  Believe it or not, the action of this (very violent) story is  driven by dialogue, which you'd better pay attention to.  Viewers  accustomed to yapping and napping through a film while waiting for the  &quot;good parts&quot; will find themselves quickly lost here.  So do  yourself a favor: take the phone off the hook, finish folding your laundry  some other time, AND PAY ATTENTION.
0884271153|5.0|From a list of UnDesired Effects (UDE) via a cloud through a Current Reality Tree to the Future Reality Tree. In &quot;It´s Not Luck&quot; Goldratt takes the reader through the thinking processes, which &quot;The  Goal&quot; fell short of. Read it as an inspiring article -not as a novel.  Alex Rogo´s success is so unbelievable, but that´s exactly what Goldratt  wants to show: unconventional thinking can make apparently impossible  things possible.<br />(P.S. For a great novel, read Douglas Adams´ &quot;Dirk  Gently´s holistic detective agency&quot;).
0783225199|5.0|You'll really love this movie even if you don't like comedies
B00000AFFF|4.0|Not to sound like an old fogey (I'm 42), but I've recently despaired of finding a new pop album that appealed to my changing musical sensibilties (I find myself more &amp; more inclined to buy Sinatra , Bennett, &amp; the  like.) Happily this CD has turned out to be a great find: a wonderfully  romantic, though not sticky sweet,  collection of tunes made by two  seasoned masters of the pop form that adults can listen to again &amp;  again with real pleasure. Imagine 60 years of songwriting experience  between Burt &amp; Elvis, &amp; they still sound fresh &amp; good! Not much  more to say 'cept I love it.
0609603086|2.0|As an avid fan of Ken Follet, I was thrilled when he came out with this new book.  The plot was interesting, but it just never grabbed the reader and got them involved in the storyline.  The main villan just seems like  another everyday psycho.  What happened to the excellent espionage that  Follet used to write?<br />The strong and caring relationship between the  FBI daughter and the SFPD father was a definite positive for this  book.<br />If you are a true-blue Follet fan, you will make it to the end of  this book albeit with the hope that it gets better as you go along.
0345389409|5.0|I enjoyed the vampire-centered story as I am a fan of The Vampire Chronicles, but the new interpretations of biblical stories astounded me.  Rice's images of Heaven and Hell, and her portrayal of the Devil as being  misunderstood really made the read worth while
B000001FQQ|5.0|Rise to it and Hide your heart are the only 2 songs this album needed to hook me, I have only been a KISS fan since 9-98, but in that short time I have realized that KISS is one of my top 5 favorite bands. What I think is  strange is that people are usually hooked by old songs, leave it to me to  be the outcast and get hooked on KISS by their newest album. Thats right,  Psycho Circus the song is all it took for me to become an instant KISS  addict and since then I have listened to them damn near every second I get  and I won't stop any time soon! If you like this album I strongly recommend  &quot;Destroyer&quot;, &quot;Creatures of the Night&quot;, &quot;Crazy  Nights&quot;, Psycho Circus&quot; and &quot;Lick it Up&quot; (I am only  going by what I own so far, but they all kick ass!)One more thing, if you  like KISS I also recommend VAN HALEN, AC/DC,GUNS N' ROSES and AEROSMITH. If  you go more for heavier stuff I suggest (IMMENSELY) IRON MAIDEN, MEGADETH,  METALLICA, OZZY OSBOURNE, BLACK SABBATH, ROB ZOMBIE-(solo)and BRUCE  DICKINSON-(he is the ex-IRON MAIDEN vocalist who went solo) Alright, i've  taken up enough space and I gotta go, but before I do I want to say TAKE MY  ADVICE, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!
6302181569|5.0|This is what Science Fiction is all about. In fact this my favorite SCiFi movie ever. The state of the art may have improved but you won't get a better storyline. I have yet to find a more menacing evil than ones own  subconscious. Funny how you don't need a lot of special effects when the  story is interesting and fun to watch.
6305169187|3.0|This movie is okay for teenie boppers. The storyline is a little ridiculous. I'm sure if I was 16 again, I would think it was the best movie ever made.  Sadly, I'm not 16. It is definitely a renter though. Great for  Friday night. I do love the song by Aerosmith, maybe that's the best part  of the whole movie!
B000007ODM|5.0|I heard the &quot;Ameno&quot; song when I was out one evening.  I asked someone what it was from, and they said &quot;Era&quot;.  I tracked down the CD, and bought it.  I found other good songs on the CD also.  All I can  say is that it is great (I preferred the Mother and Mother remixes least).   I hope this form of music catches on.  For a lack of a better name, I would  call the form &quot;Gregorian Techno&quot; which mixes  Gregorian Chanting  and Latin (the language in the songs is great, but not real Latin), with  techno.
B00000DHRX|5.0|I really enjoy both the &quot;for your heart&quot; and &quot;for your feet&quot; idea behind these CD's.  I love being able to listen to the more upbeat CD during drivetimes/parties and enjoying the more laid-back CD at  more relaxing/quiet times.  I dare anyone not to get movin' on the tune  &quot;Outside.&quot; And the older tunes really take me back to my high  school years.  Great set at a great price!
B000002BUY|5.0|Incubus is exactly the pinnacle Faith No More could never reach.<br />Hardcore, funk, hip-hop, dance and metal combine to bring you Incubus.  S.c.i.e.n.c.e. is possibly the best cd to come out from a new  bands in years.  I like all sorts of music from jazz to hardcore to the  Beatles, and Incubus is up there in my top 4-5 favorite bands.  They  combine the crazy style changes in each song reminiscent of Mr. Bungle or  Primus and each song does something totally different.  I have seen them 3  times in concert...and to say they are amazing is an understatement.  The  last time I saw them the lead singer had a sore throat so they played an  instrumental set (most bands would have just left without thinking twice).      A must buy for fans of the new-hardcore wave (i.e. deftones, KoRn,  Downset, (hed)pe and others) but don't le the commonly-placed label throw  you...these guys are different and a definite band to look out for.
6305169187|5.0|Honestly, this is the only movie which has ever kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through...
B000002TYX|5.0|The Beatles Anthology is the best CD a Beatles fan could wish for.  It has a wide variety of outtakes of their live performances and studio recordings.  It's interesting to hear how many of The Beatles' best songs  started out in the studio and blossomed into the style and warmth that was  theirs alone.  Rare live performances are fun to listen to - they give you  a real feel of what Beatlemania was all about.  There are also brief  excerpts from John, Paul, and the group's manager, Brian Epstein.  Listen  for the Beatles' earlist recordings and also George Harrison's first song.   To top it off a colorful booklet with many pictures comes along with it,  telling you much information about each track.
6305089957|4.0|I liked Scream 2, but, as Randy said in the movie, sequels are never as good.  For one thing, they SHOULD NOT have killed Randy, if they do make a Scream 3, they won't have any funny lines, because Stu and Randy got the  best lines in the original. And secondly, the one killer, whatever his name  was, didn't have a good motive.  Scream was much better.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|This is an cool CD that many will like. I am disappointed at some of the new trendy songs that Offspring put in it, but I still would recommend it to anyone.
6304233639|4.0|I SAW THIS THE FIRST DAY IT CAME OUT ON THEATRES.  I BAUGHT IT THE FIRST DAY IT CAME OUT ON VIDEO!  NOT REALISTIC, BUT VERY ENTERTAINING.  WHY WRITE A REVIEW NOW? BECAUSE IT'S COMING ON TELEVISION TONIGHT.  I REALLY ENJOYED  THIS PRODUCTION, WHICH I THINK, AND MY FRIENDS THOUGHT WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO  RESULT IN A HIGH 4 OUT OF 5.
B000002J1B|5.0|Perhaps the most emotional effort by this band.  &quot;Gates of Delerium&quot; is one of the (sadly) largely unacknowledged masterpieces of rock, with dynamics stretching from overwhelmingly intense to the ethereal.   This album also has &quot;To Be Over,&quot; another overlooked gem. Takes  a while to grow on those just starting to explore Yes, and perhaps not the  best place to begin if so, but Relayer was definately one of their peaks.
B000002KK2|4.0|It was this cd which let me know there was still a talent female singer in this bare world, especially music world. The style of those songs was so unique that no one could deny it. If you want to know rlj, you'd better  know her from this one.
0812550706|4.0|I thought the intricate storyline and the many unexpected plot twists were very impressive, but that most caertainly by no means excused the pathetic ending that Card created for this certain title. (For all who have read  this title: He should have just stomped on the stupid cocoon or whatever it  was).
0780624890|4.0|Finally, a movie that compares with the original Batman. Fight scenes are well choreographed and the cinemetography is to die for. A definate recommendation for those looking for something new and different.
6302732778|5.0|The Director's Cut of the greatest Sci-Fi film ever made takes the original with its cheesy voice over narration and sappy ending and turns it into a film of subtle nuances and great visual story-telling.  The  inclusion of the &quot;unicorn sequence&quot; also adds a disturbing twist  to the end that was completely lost in the theatrical release.  I was  awestruck by the original release but found myself insulted by the studio's  inclusion of the voice-over...this is how the film should have been seen.   Take this opportunity and order the Director's Cut now.
0792839714|4.0|In many ways this is a better film than Jurassic Park. The end sequence with the Gunslinger pursuing a guest has to be the most memorable. Over the years I have enjoyed this film but more recently it has taken on new  meaning. There is something chillingly familiar about computer systems  constantly falling foul of bugs...I think if a Delos like park opens in the  near future I'll make sure to give it a wide berth.<br />Yul Brynner is  memorable in this film especially since his unstoppable killing machine  predates the Terminator. A classic SF movie.
B000001FCB|5.0|Tom Jobim and Elis Regina.  The best Brazil can offer in terms of music.  She is probably the greatest singer we have ever had.  Tom Jobim is already known by everyone who has interest in Jazz and obviously, Bossa Nova.  This  CD contains the best of Tom's in the most beautifull voice.  I bought it 3  years ago and it still remains in the top of my personal ranking besides  other Tom's titles.
B000001OAA|5.0|I still haven't heard their second cd, but judging by this masterpiece, it should be fantastic. Most mainstream alternative bands have a male lead singer (except Hole, of course) and judging by the examples, rock would be  much more interesting if that was not so. Being a feminist, I like how  Manson's voice is angry, and powerful, not to mention wonderful sounding,  something you don't hear alot of in music today. Each and every song is  great! Personally, my favorite lyric is &quot;You thought I was a little  girl/you thought I was a little mouse/ You thought you'd take me by  suprise/ Now I'm here burning down your house&quot; Actually from one of my  favorite songs, &quot;Not My Idea&quot;
B0000025DD|4.0|Dave Gilmour's solo album is highly underrated.  It's a great album to listen to, and the best of the solo works by Pink Floyd members.  This is a necessary appendix to Floyd album collections.
0792139771|5.0|Magic.  This film is one of the few that has made me cheer, and has had the power to make me cry.  It is timeless because the world is indeed a stage, and all of us are actors on it; unfortunately the actors haven't  changed much.  The history is impossible to depict accurately, as Scotland  in the 1300's didn't have many historians.(To say nothing of honest ones)   But screenwriter Wallace, makes use of mythical themes from Socrates and  Christ, and creates a hero/martyr that would make an Athiest weep.  Nothing  is so sad as seeing a Brave man die for something truly worth dying for,  than seeing the masses let him die because they are cowards and idiots.   This is Gibson's Masterpiece.
0385484518|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The graphic description of the disease is often times very hard to read but the message this book sends about life and living is extraordinary.  I am truly touched by it.
6301562925|1.0|Well everyone the only revenge Michael gets is on his fans. I must say that as much of a fan that i am of the Halloween films (especially the first 2)-this one stinks.  This one had neither creative characters or a  decent script. By the way what did they do to the Myers house in this  one!!!
1559408898|4.0|I've got to take issue with the previous posting. This disc IS widescreen (1:66 Ratio). While it might not have the huge black bars associated with the 2:35 ratio, that doesn't mean it isn't letterboxed! This is what the  film was originally shot in and the director approved the transfer in that  aspect ratio. This disc is very entertaining although even the die-hard  Paul Verhoeven fan may find it violent.
B000002KLG|5.0|Love X Love is a pure classic song to listen to from the &quot;GIVE ME TONIGHT&quot; album. you can sit back and listen to George Benson putting in his best, or you can even dance to its groove. You listen to the words  and it just brings you back to that old or new love. I never get tired of  listening to it. I am sure you will enjoy it as much as I have. check it  out!
B000007PSR|5.0|There would have been no Pink Floyd without Syd Barrett.  This man is magnificent; A bit nonsensical which makes it great.  I highly recommend this to those who do not listen to Pink Floyd post Barrett.
B00000DC10|2.0|I love punk music, and I purchased &quot;The Shape Of Punk To Come&quot; based on Amazon's assessment of it as the best punk CD of 1998, and because based on the title I was hoping to hear something fresh.  Unfortunately, I  discovered a dressed-up but basically conventional scream- shouted punk CD  that bordered on the monotonous.  Certain stylistic elements of this music  remind me of  the Rollins Band, Fugazi, Sonic Youth, and Metallica, and it  carries an attitude of anti-capitalist self-importance similar to the  Clash.  But this music is not very good.   In fact, most of the time  &quot;The Shape Of Punk To Come&quot; makes the idea of violent revolution  seem too tedious to bother with.  Although there are some interesting  filler bits sprinkled in between the tracks, most of the songs sound  similar and derivative.  I might have given this CD as many as three stars  anyway, if it weren't for its violation of  the cardinal rule of  mediocre  punk rock, which is to keep the songs short.   Many of these songs are  LONG, some over six minutes.  While this is fine if a band has the  compositional talent to back it up, there is far too little musical  inspiration and intelligence  on this CD to sustain punk tracks of this  length.              Refused is proudly pro-violent-revolution.    &quot;This manifesto is very much for real,&quot; they boast, apparently  just in case some listeners perceive their stance as a put-on.   Although  this statement of determination sounds rather lame compared to Johnny  Rotten's &quot;We MEAN it, maaaaan!&quot;  I might actually have rated this  CD a little higher if it made ideological sense.  (After all, I loved the  Clash, and they were leftists too.)    Refused apparently can't decide  which ideology they're railing against.   When they write,  &quot;The  Apollo Programme was a hoax or so we say.  The biggest lie was market  economy that blinded us with the glory of prosperity and freedom,&quot; it  doesn't seem to occur to them that the Apollo Program was the product of  big government, not a market economy.  (Exactly why they think it was so  bad to land on the moon, they don't say.)      In summary, is there  anything exceptional about this CD?   No.  The quality of this punk rock is  average in its very best moments, and the lyrics are as juvenile as they  are pretentious.  &quot;We could be dangerous- art as a real threat,&quot;  they sing.  Sorry, not this art.  Is there anything redeeming about this  CD?   Well, musically, I've listened to worse punk.   A few songs  are  moderately enjoyable (if only they weren't so long), but any one of  Fugazi's releases (including this year's &quot;End Hits&quot;) are a  hundred times better than this.   Is &quot;The Shape Of Punk To Come&quot;  the shape of punk to come?   I hope not, because if it is, I'm going to  have to find a different favorite rock genre.
0792839234|5.0|This movie is simply a cult classic.  The story of young Mike and Jody encountering the evil tall man. Im not quite sure about the plot for this one but its still rocks anyway.  The sequels were all good also and hope  that Don will make more in the future.  Watch out for the flying Ball!!  A  must see for any PHAN
0440224764|5.0|I think that this is the best book he has written and I am only a junior in high school. I also enjoyed A Time To KILL very much, but to really enjoy this book you must enjoy his other book &quot;The Run Away  Jury&quot;... in my mind it has some connection... maybe it doesn't but i  enjoy these two very much... they are the best so read not one of these but  BOTH!!!!
B000002KLG|5.0|Love x's Love is a pure classic from the &quot;GIVE ME TONIGHT&quot;'s ALBUM. You sit back and listen, and it just takes you back to your old love or new love. George benson's voice gives this song pure gusto to  it.Definitly one of my favorites. I never get tired of it.
6304117345|1.0|What I really did not like about this movie was how it showed people from the Middle East. People from the Middle East were depicted as terrorists who want to blow us up, so we have to kill them first, to protect  ourselves.  I wish one of the &quot;good guys&quot; in the movie could have  been from the Middle East, so that people don't go away from this movie  thinking that everyone in the Middle East is a terrorist.
B00000FCBC|5.0|This is an album for the ages it includes 11 new covers and many songs from past garage days albums. My self being 15 i am too young to remember the early garage days albums which are hard to find in stores. Some bands  can have 1 good song on an album. Metallicas got two cds of them.
B000009PNY|5.0|At first I didn't know what to expect when the Deftones and Rammstein remade the overtly moody and quieter Depeche Mode songs.  However, as I listened to the CD, I began to realize how great it truly was.  The  Smashing Pumpkins do a good cover, and so do Veruca Salt, Failure, and the  Deftones.  However, in a true surprise, (and contrary to what most of the  other reviews say), I think that Rammstein's version of Stripped is by far  the best song on the album and works surprisingly well in the  context........
6303022901|5.0|It took 3 seperate viewings to fully appreciate the complexity of the characters, and to keep them all straight. Just a wonderful movie about survival and womans rights and the lack of them in other cultures.
630512065X|5.0|Beautiful choreography.  Jazz, ballet, character-it's all there to see.  This video is so reminiscent of some of the best choreographic style that came out of the 80's, not to mention the style of the costumes.  This video  was so easy to get into and understand, the whole family will surely enjoy  it.  I loved this video because it was easy to follow.
0679410503|4.0|Progressively difficult to finish. Devoured the first book in a day, never finished the third (I got bored). Very enchanting back-drops and great character development. Will cause nightmares in the sensitive reader.
B00000F1D3|5.0|Cher is back people...Love Her as we always hav
079213690X|5.0|This movie is one of the greatest epics ever created.  Mel Gibson is absolutly one of the greatest actor/director/producers of all time and can easily match any major stars.  His portral of William Wallace was amazing.   The emotion showed was outstanding.  In an earlier review someone gave the  movie a 2 due to the pricesses lines?  When she spoke that the reason she  was helping him because of the way he looked at her, she fell in love.  She  never had love before so yes that is enough to give away a kingdoms worth  of secrets.  Now no more from me, everyone must see this movie many a time!
0393038912|3.0|In the epilogue to this book, the author states explicitly that his intent is not to discount the importance of intelligence to human survival.  Rather, his intent is to explain the effects of environment on the  developments of societies. It seems clear that random geographical effects  alone cannot explain why Europeans had so much &quot;cargo&quot; of their  own, while the indigenous peoples of Africa, Australia, and the Americas  had so little.  This book is a clear description of how geography and  random luck influenced the development of societies.<br />But there is much  left unanswered.  Diamond states that the east-west orientation of Eurasia  contributed, in part, to the rapid diffusion of agriculture and other  technology. But not all cultures of Eurasia evolved into world-conquering  superpowers.  For example, France colonized much of Southeast Asia.  But  according to Diamond's theory, Southeast Asia should have had about the  same technology as France because both countries are Eurasian.<br />Not all  Eurasian cultures were so successful in their efforts to expand or even  survive.  For example, the culture of the Egyptian empires lasted for  thousands of years but died out, and, has left little but a few crumbling  stone tombs.  But the culture of Greece had profound and fundamental  influences on European and Muslim culture.  According to Diamond, both  Egyptian and Greek culture should have evolved into superpowers because  they both developed in Eurasia. It was the Greeks who passed their ideas  on; the Egyptians died and faded away.<br />There is a non-geographical  explanation of why the Egyptian empires eventually died out.  These empires  came to the point where vast amounts of the empire's production were spent,  not on infrastructure for use by the living, but on vast resources for the  dead! How long can a culture that glorifies death, and spends its treasury  on dead emporors, survive? The Greeks did not value death, but knowledge.   The Greeks spent time by learning new technologies or inventing better  defenses.  It's no mistake that the Greeks passed thier legacy on, while  the Egyptians did not.<br />So, much is accounted for by considering the  geography in which a culture exists.  The author needs to state at the  beginning of the book that his treatment focuses on the deterministic  causes of human societies.  He should also state that deterministic causes  alone cannot explain all outcomes of world history.
B000001E18|5.0|U2 wrote and recorded ACHTUNG BABY and then blew out onto the road with a massive show making fun of it all called ZooTV.  It was literally the greatest show on Earth.  After touring the U.S., Europe, and then another  round of shows in the U.S., U2 had a few months of break time before  bringing ZooTV around Europe, Australia, and Japan.  Most bands would take  a vacation.  U2 locked themselves in the studio and came up with ZOOROPA.   The album stands alone, and also works as a sequel to ACHTUNG BABY.   Musically, it's a bold and experimental statement that won't appeal to all,  but will excite many.  Lyrically, it is a field day for Bono to finally get  out emotions on the state of the world, touring, and life.  Amazing that  they were albe to make this in only a couple months.  (Note: Zooropa is the  second part to an unofficial trilogy that began with ACHTUNG BABY and would  end with POP four years later.)
B000002BQK|3.0|This is a good album, but the &quot;new&quot; Mariah isn't! Her voice is too thin and so is her wardrobe. I like some of the hip-hop songs like &quot;Breakdown&quot; and &quot; The Beautiful Ones&quot;, but on all the  other ones it's like she tries to hard to be black. She puts on an act and  tries to be cool for everyone like she's paranoid about what people think  about her. The fans would think very highly of her if she acted like her  normal self. Over all the album is worth buying just like evey other one of  her albums.
B000001EAQ|5.0|POP was poorely promoted.  The reps at Island told the world U2 were gonna make a dance album or a hip hop album or a techno album, and its none of those things.  Instead, it is the end of U2's experimental trilogy that  began with ACHTUNG BABY and ZOOROPA.  It is a deep exploration of the human  heart and soul, the socio-political conditions of the world, and some of  the most experimental and amazing musical concepts ever to be recorded.   This is the one that's been underrated, and probably always will be.  It is  a deep album, and a musically daring one, but it can't be easily labeled,  making it somewhat of an enigma for the masses.  The following tour,  POPMART, while fun, didn't do justice to the album, as the live versions of  these complex songs just couldn't add up.  Approach this album with an open  heart and mind (and ear).  Plug it in and play, and above all else, listen.   You'll be amazed.
0767812417|5.0|&quot;Oliver!&quot; has songs you'll just love, such as &quot;Where is Love?&quot;, &quot;Consider Yourself&quot;, &quot;It's a Fine Life&quot;, and &quot;I'll Do Anything&quot;.  This Oscar-winning movie stars loveable  Ron Moody as Fagin, Shani Willis as Nancy, Mark Lester as Oliver, Jack Wild  as the Artful Dodger, and Oliver Reed as Bill Sikes.  It's definitely worth  buying!
B000001DTM|5.0|After the end of their landmark &quot;Rattle &amp; Hum&quot; tour, Bono and the boys of U2 decided to take a trip to Berlin to begin work on a new album in 1990.  What they found was that they couldn't relate to each other  musically, and they were on the verge of breaking up.  In the middle of all  the bleakness, Edge started playing some chords, Bono started improvising  lyrics, Adam started with the bass line, Larry banged on some drums, and  &quot;One&quot; was born, saving the band and beginning work on their most  brilliant album, ACHTUNG BABY.  This album is, in a word, perfect.  It  brings U2 to the end of the world musically and emotionally, with lyrics by  Bono capturing moments in life that are so true and so rare to see  represented this realistically.  A must have for anyone.  (Note: I  distinctly remember HATING this album the first time I heard it.  So, if  you try it once and don't like it, listen to it again.. and again...)
6305001200|5.0|I just love &quot;Grease&quot; because of its great music, excellent actors (Travolta and Newton-John make a cute couple), and situations that the characters always face with a smile.  This movie makes the '50s look  cool like &quot;Happy Days&quot;.  &quot;Grease&quot; has been a hit for 20  years and will be remembered as one of the greatest musicals of all time.
0783225857|5.0|Gregory Peck and cast put together a film that transends the genre.  The set, cast, storyline, and literary adaption are all on-the-mark.  In addition, the bonus material adds insight into the making of the film.  A  must have for any collector!
0792151712|5.0|&quot;Titanic&quot; is an excellent movie from director James Cameron.  DiCaprio and Winslet make a great couple in this movie that always keeps you in suspense!  Did you know that &quot;Titanic&quot; is the most popular  movie of all time?

0316152196|5.0|This is my favorite Bosch book so far (although I'm still waiting for Connelly to give us another classic like THE POET).  This one starts right off at full blast and does not relent.  Also, as a native Los Angelino, I can testify that Connelly really gets the flavor, the landmarks, the racial tensions, the city politics and the names of the restaurants right.  I've even discovered a couple of cool places based on locations in his books. Brilliant premise, brilliant execution.  Now Mike, go write another POET.
1559408855|2.0|Pier Paolo Pasolini's notorious 1975 shocker &quot;Salo&quot; is an extremely well-made, disturbing, and sometimes powerful film. It's also incredibly boring, pretentious, and cowardly. Despite the incredible set  design and cinematography, &quot;Salo&quot; fails on several levels.   Somehow, Pasolini managed to turn de Sade's most incendiary work (&quot;The  120 Days of Sodom&quot;) into a dry-as-dirt snorefest, occasionally livened  up by assorted atrocities, including rape, coprophagy, and  torture.<br />What's most offensive isn't the graphic sexual violence (of  which there is plenty), but Pasolini's choice to make his victims  emotionless automatons. Pasolini's refusal to treat his victims as human  beings changes what could have been a potentially powerful statement about  the corruption of power into a dull peep show. &quot;Salo&quot; fails as  art, because the film is dishonest in its portrayal of human suffering.  Even worse, it lacks the bite of good exploitation fare, because it's  pretentious, dull, and way too long.  <br />--Dave Jaudon
B000001GQB|5.0|This recording of Mozart's last symphonies (what happened to the 37th?) is a truly magnificent series of carefully crafted and insightful interpretations by Karl Bhm who obviously knew and loved Mozart's music in  every exquisite detail. Despite the age of the recordings which took place  between 1959 and 1966, DG has done a superlative job in employing their  image-bit process which has resulted in an ethereal and sterling aural  experience. In addition, making the CD's look like reproductions of vinyl  LP's is a wonderful sentimental touch especially for &quot;aging&quot; baby  boomers like myself whose initial classical (or any other format for that  matter) recording was on black vinyl.  A definite must for every classical  music collector, serious or otherwise, searching for the exceptional  &quot;standard&quot; in interpretations of Mozart's work.
1572523166|4.0|i started to watch it thinking it was gonna' be another rock star who can really sing, but not act.  this movie rules! it's great it's truly an awsome  movie.  Wonderful acting a great setting, but certian parts didn't  make sense.  and it could have ended with the song &quot;The Man Who Sold  The World&quot;, by Bowie himself. but all in all it was a good movie.
1573226521|5.0|I think that this is one of the most beautiful books I have ever read. Not just the way in which it is written but the way it provoked images in my head. Some of the theories explored in it are really exciting and new  ideas. I absolutely loved it!
B000002572|5.0|Alongside Deep Purple's &quot;Made in Japan&quot; this album as the other reviewers have already correctly pointed out has to qualify as the best studio recorded rock album ever. When it was released ( I was in High  School back then) it simply moved rock in to a new, and higher gear, in  terms of the quality of not only its songs, its guitar riffs and the  overall delivery from the band but also in terms of how well the album was  produced. For young rock fans, here is where you start from (check out Deep  Purple's live recording from the Budokan as well). You may well quickly  graduate in to Metallica's black album (another future reference album) and  as you  get older in to classical music. The fact that I still listen to  this album weekly after all these years says it all. Wish the world of rock  could do more like this.
0385484518|1.0|What a banal load of crap! Do people really buy this stuff? I read the story of a marginally talented writer taking advantage of a dying man to push national buttons. Yikes this book was terrible. Buy a pound of  Hallmark cards next time, you'll get the same insights.
