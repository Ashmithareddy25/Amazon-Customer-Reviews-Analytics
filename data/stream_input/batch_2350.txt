1439102813|5.0|Awesome biography of a college professor who becomes forgetful and begins to realize the memory lapses are more than middle age job pressure and the steps she takes to live and teach as the challenges of family and job are altered by the onset of an unreversible condition
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|I wasn't planning on going to see the movie but now I think I will, the music has such a great atmosphere to it, very dark and futuristic, kind of like the Tron soundtrack by daftpunk. I don't think there is one track that I dont like. I love track 17 with Susan Sundfor, her voice is so pure.<br />Only $5 now on Amazon at time of writing it is a steal, go for it you won't regret it!

0762445262|4.0|Just keep in mind this is a tiny little light and you should be satisified.  I knew that going in to the purchase so I wasn't expecting anything special.  It's a simple little bat signal and will only work on light colored walls.  I initially turned it on in a bathroom with navy walls and got nothing.  As soon as I moved it over to a white door I had no problems seeing the image.  My son got a kick out of falling asleep to it.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Purchased Argo.  Got a great price and quick ship.  Get this one.  I see why they got Academy nominations?  Thanks.
B00471TLZS|5.0|Must see (I've probably seen it at least a dozen times over the years). Fairly safe for children, however it could cause some nightmares for the younger ones.
B004W10S9G|4.0|A good old-fashioned sword-and-sandal movie mixed with religion, romance and a bunch of lions. Light years ahead of a turkey like The Robe.
B004ODLUF8|5.0|Imax is the standard that all other DVD's must measure up to.<br /><br />This film shows how valuable the Hubble Telescope is & will continue to be for a long time.<br /><br />Very well done!
B0067YF02Q|4.0|Overall happy with the blu ray of Unforgiven.  The book packaging is nice and has great info.  The picture quality is not reference, but good.  It's a very dark film both in story and in picture, but blu ray is nice enough presentation.  Sounds great.  Though not a Hollywood-ending type of film, it ushered in a new type of anti-hero and is probably Eastwood's best.
0767840135|5.0|There is nothing else to compare this circus to.<br /><br />It is so well done...complete entertainment...Many kudos!<br /><br />I can't wait to buy the one made from Beatles music & Sgt Pepper.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I was so very sad when I finished the final season. This may be my all-time favorite series!  The characters were so endearing and the storyline so engaging.  I loved everything about Lark Rise to Candleford.
B000MRA5EM|5.0|IMAX is the standard film that all others are judged by.<br /><br />This is a stunningly well made film. The narration by Johnny Depp & Kate Winslet explore the values & virtues of a dieing Planet.<br /><br />I bought a used DVD for very little & am fully satisfied with my choice.<br /><br />I buy lots of Nature films...especially IMAX.
0307744434|1.0|I found this book difficult to finish. The premise of the book was intriguing but the actual execution was not a great experience. The story felt contrived and uncohesive. Even though she has some beautiful descriptions in the book of scenes in the circus, sadly this did not make up for the slap dash feel of the story. It would have been a better read if it was presented as a series of short stories, centered around the circus.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I wasn't thrilled with this at first but once I got used to the nra scenes and challenges I found this to be every bit as fun as the first and even more so.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game. I work nights so I play at work to keep myself awake. My little kids love it too.
1439152802|2.0|I finally, finally finished this book..by the hardest.  While Kate is a good writer, she needs to learn to edit, edit..she has a lot of superfluous rhetoric in it.  Whole sections could be left out, and there is too much back and forth with years and events to get a complete picture of what happened.  Why not just start at the beginning and go to the end, in sequence?  Even after finishing it, I am still not sure what the story was between Vivian and Dorothy...I won't be s \\"spoiler\\", but if what I think happened between them happened I wouldn't be able to buy that story at all.  She does have some good plots and stories, but not all of them hold your interest.  I am glad to finally finish the book, and after also reading \\"The House at Riverton\\" which has the same problems, I am going to put Kate Morton \\"on hold\\" for a long time!

1616614609|5.0|I love this game.  I've been playing it whenever possible.  The depth this game goes into is very unique, especially given the fact that you have a runner and a corporation, each with different styles of gameplay, different tactics, with only one common goal, getting agenda points.  I'm really looking forward to getting some of the expansions to see hour each faction grows.<br /><br />The only recommendation I'd have is if you are going to play this with a buddy, each needs to get their own box.  If you are going to play both runner and corporation against each other it will save time not needing to break down and rebuild your deck between games.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This is a great game. I have been playing on and off. Great game play. I would recommend this game to family and friends.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I've always liked this game and this version is no different. The levels don't seem to get more challenging, just a change in set up of the tiles. There are times where I cannot understand how one tile can be click on but other in the same position cannot. That sometimes get frustrating. Over all, I like the game and will continue playing!
B009O5CLZY|5.0|A really good app it is totally worth your money. It is really cheap, but fun. Cool app. Please buy it.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Great game! Just one problem, sometimes in the middle of play goes to beginning. Still when working fun and challenging.

0374158460|5.0|What is freedom?<br /><br />Freedom to or freedom from?<br /><br />How free are we really? What do we want? Why do we do what we do? What are we running from?<br /><br />Easy to read, placing you into a complex world. These characters feel real and are flawed just as we are.
6304469519|1.0|The singing is fine, Pavarotti in particular. But the acting is very bad from all concerned. And the production is incredibly overproduced. The costumes are ridiculous and overdone, like a Halloween costume party on steroids. The scenery is not just bad, it is horrendous. Most of the scenes look like a child's painting of the desert. And the triumphal march is anything but triumphal. The stage is full of large, heavy looking, shifting Egyptian monuments. It consists of slaves being forced to work by a platoon of guards, while the chorus tries to avoid being crushed by the monumental moving scenery, and the principals are brought in on chariots which look like floats in Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. This is by far the worst Aida that I have seen on dvd. The dvd of the Domingo/Metropolitan Opera production is much better. And the Pavarotti/San Francisco Opera dvd is very good.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I music of the Phantom of the Opera was fabulous,  The color and live shooting made the show more appealing that the original Phantom of the Opera. This movie is great for loving couples who love music

1617751588|5.0|I got a copy of this book to review through Librarything's Early Reviewer Program.  Thanks to Akashic and Librarything for a chance to review this book.  This was a super fun and cute read that cat fans of all ages will love.<br /><br />This is the third book released featuring Simon's Cat.  The focus of this book, as the title suggests, is the addition of a new kitten to the household and how exactly Simon's cat feels about all of that.<br /><br />Simon's cat started out as a web comic.  For those who have followed the web comic, you know there are no words in the cartoons.  So there are no words in this book, just the whole series of cartoons.  The cartoons start from the acquisition of the new kitten, to later in the year when Simon's Cat and the kitten are finally working together more.<br /><br />All ages of cat lovers will find this book hilarious.  My family and I just got a new kitten a few months ago and so we could relate, first hand, to a lot of the kitten antics that were in here.  My six year old son laughed so hard he was almost in tears and my husband and I also found the book to be incredibly funny.<br /><br />As you can imagine this book explore how a kitten can make an older cat's life very difficult.  It also looks out how a kitten and cat can work together to make a human's life very hectic.  As the book goes on there are even dogs, birds, bunnies, and hedgehogs involved.<br /><br />The first portion of the book was the funniest.  As the bunnies and hedgehogs got involved my family had a harder time relating to the comics and didn't find them quite as funny.<br /><br />The final part of the book gives instructions on how you too can draw all of the animals in this book.<br /><br />Overall a very cute and funny read.  Highly recommended to all fans of cat humor.  The drawings are cute and the antics of the kitten and cat are pretty darn accurate.  I really enjoyed this book, it will make a great book to sit on the coffee table to make people laugh..
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The author keeps you locked into the book till the very end! Very captivating . Highly recommend. Difficult go put it down. Constantly surprising and very suspenseful .
B0015NORBO|4.0|The album plays great although it is slightly warped.<br />This has to be one of the best debut albums ever! The song writing and playing are incredibly tight!
B006IYG5HE|5.0|This is the second Harry Hole book that I have read. I read a ton of thrillers and I must say that this series is the best that I have found in a long while.  The main character is brilliant and damaged. This type of protagonist has been used too many times lately, but Harry Hole is a breath of fresh air. The addition of the Scandinavian locale really brings in a different perspective. Learning about Norway's political and legal system is very interesting sidebar to the main story.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|Well, it was only in 2012 that I jumped on the USB 3.0 bandwagon. Despite being VERY technologically inclined, my budget never seems to allow for cutting-edge upgrades. The one upside to this predicament is that by the time I upgrade there are plenty of solid accessories on the market. This is my fourth USB 3.0 hub, the first two were unsatisfactory in their design and the third is in use with my test bench PC. I tried this on my main desktop using both Windows 7 and OS X (works great on both), using two Mushkin SSDs and a Sandisk Extreme Pro CF as my benchmarking drives. I would like to thank Anker for sending me this product in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />GENERAL SPECS<br />- The hub itself is 2.5\\" on each side, and just under 0.5\\" thick.<br />- The hub has four female USB 3.0 expansion port, one on each side.<br />- It has a USB 3.0 cable attached - it measure 6\\" in length. The cable has built-in strain relief on both sides<br /><br />DESIGN/QUALITY<br />Overall I was very pleased with the design and quality of the hub. It is a glossy, piano-black, that looks good but definitely attracts fingerprints. It seems sturdy enough, held together by four screws that will do the job much better than internal clips (pretty common). As mentioned above, the USB cable has built-in strain relief (the rubber coverings you see on USB cables), definitely important for a device that travels around with your laptop and is constantly being pulled out/plugged in. One really nice feature is that the USB ports are all on completely different sides - there's nothing worse than having to unplug a device to fit another in as seen on hubs with all the ports lined up in a row! I have a rather wide CF card reader, and an SD card reader where the card itself sticks out the side, and there is absolutely no way for me to use the aforementioned \\"aligned\\" USB hubs. Bonus points for that!<br /><br />PERFORMANCE<br />Well as with any USB 3.0 device, it must work synergistically  with your other components. My motherboard has built-in USB 3.0 (check), my peripherals are USB 3.0 (check) and finally both the drives I was using are SSDs with high read/write speeds on SATA III (triple check). Keeping in mind that speed specifications are (a) partly marketing and (b) theoretical outputs, you still should be able to achieve some really impressive speeds with this hub!<br /><br />Test 1: 95/90MBs CF Card using USB 3.0 Card Reader<br />Well, this was pretty much a given, and my benchmarking software reported my fastest read speed at 91MB/s and my fastest write speed at 88MB/s. No surprises that with relatively low max speeds, the hub/chipset would have no problem handling the CF card<br /><br />Test 2: SSD to SSD File transfer<br />With one SSD in my PC and the other in an IcyDock Docking Station, I fired up the benchmarking software once more. I was VERY pleased to see that both maximum rates were less than 10% off of the drives' rated speeds (550MB/s read 515MB/s write). To ensure fairness, I performed the same test with the docking station plugged directly into the USB 3.0 port on my motherboard, with very close results.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I was very pleased to see that this hub did not bottleneck speeds whatsoever, and managed to keep up with everything very nicely. I am particularly fond of the design of this device, that allows me to keep whatever I want plugged in without things getting cramped between ports. With the built-in cable, this is ideal for desktop and laptop use, and reduces clutter by not having a lengthy cable that you have to run behind your computer. So far, I can highly recommend this hub, and will update this review if there are any issues with quality over time.your other components.

B008JFUUIA|5.0|Do you like Mean Girls? Do you like Glee? Do you like Bring it On? Well, if you said yes to any one (or more) of these, then you are probably going to love pitch perfect. For a comedy, it has pretty good character development and story line along with good witty one-liners. Fat Amy has an awesome performance. Overall, a really good movie to watch over and over.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This came IS amazing. Addicting to the max. I love it. Great for people from 5 to 75! I highly recommend this game.

B000KIPT30|4.0|This is a nice little mixer for the money. The individual volume controls are great for each individual to monitor themselves and control their mix.There is some distortion at the highest level, but that is to be expected in this price range. The casing is solid with sturdy knobs. The power wall wart cord is a little thin as is the line that goes from the unit to your headphone output of whatever system you are listening to. They could be a little thicker, but are not so flimsy as to break with normal use. You will have to purchase 1/8 to 1/4 headphone adapters for each of the 4 headphone inputs, but some good ones can be found for less than $1.50 each with shipping on Amazon. (Of course this will add to the price if you don't already have some.) I give it 4 stars only because of the cords mentioned. It is one of the best I have seen at this price. I liked it so much this is the second unit I have purchased as my wife &#34;stole&#34; my other one for her little studio. We both use these for internet singing as well as some home studio recording.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|I purchased two of the cables in March 2013 and the coating on the wire of both disintegrated in a short period of time.  Cables had not been used and had been stored in my computer bag and not subject to any extreme conditions.

B002N2SYWE|5.0|This film from pascal laguare makes saw look like sesamie street. The begining of the film is a touch over the top, but it didnt seem fake. The end of the movie will have you thinking about it for weeks. I was litteraly dumbfounded when I watched it. This film is set on your basic tourture-revenge plot with a massive twist on the second half of the movie. Overall goes in the top three of my collection.

B00B69UQEO|4.0|I am a devout DM fan and have been for 30 years.  Violator was my favorite album and after hearing this one, it is still my favorite DM album.  There are some good points to this group of songs but wayyyyyyyy to low key.  I was hoping for more dancable music and more catchy riffs.  No so much.  Still a huge fan of theirs though.  :)
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|this game is fantastic. the story line and graphics are amazing. I'm playing on a Kindle Fire HD and have not had any problems. it downloads and installs with no problems what so ever. l really enjoyed this game...it kept me occupied for hours. Great job.

B007SGM084|5.0|This is a love story of a truly heated kind.  The seduction of our innocent Student Ana who becomes a woman of passion and a strong and fully fleshed out character.  Her romance with Christian unfolds a complex and beautiful man inside the scarred and very hot exterior shielded by a hardened heart.  They have an exploration of the kinky side of S & M.  Who knew that we could understand the side of power and control that few really live.  it is scary and so very sensual to learn about the dynamics of a dark side of sex.  Edgy and sharp we are on the edge when looking into the alternative styles of romance.  We are looking for more.

B007UZO3F6|5.0|Very easy to put to gather. I've had issues in the past with small/mATX cases doing cable management, with the Shuttle I had no issues. I did buy some 6inch right angle SATA cables (perfect length to reach the 5.25&#34; bay at the top), which I think this case should of come with. I've read a lot of complaints about using full size cards (GTX680) and the disk bay pushing down on them, if you work the cables a bit you can get them to set at a 90 degree angle without putting pressure on your card. Oh ya and that reminds me, IT CAN RUN A FULL SIZE FULL POWER VIDEO CARD. I do have a suggestion, make sure its stock cooler, some after markets don't fit on the video cards in this case. When the video card isn't under load, I can walk into the room and be completely unsure if the PC is on...sooo quiet.<br /><br />Current Specs:<br />i7-3770K<br />16GB DDR3<br />4TB Western Digital Black<br />BDXL Burner<br />GTX480 (until my GTX Titan arrives)<br />Windows 8 Pro x64
B005IQZB14|5.0|Suffice to say, when I finished reading Wild, I wrote a heartfelt fan letter to Ms. Strayed.  Haven't done that since I was like nine and we'd write notes to movie stars asking for their pictures.  Can't imagine anyone not relating to this memoir.  Her story is compelling and she's definitely got writing chops.  Stop reading these reviews and go get the book already!

Rather than spoil the ending, I chose not to attend the book club, which is really saying something because I love the meetings.  As a point of comparison,I I contrast it with David Balducci's &#34;The Strangers&#34;, also a mystery with many plot twists.  Landay's characterization is better, and the writing is more graceful.

From little known to relatively unknown actors/actresses,<br />I was blown away by their performances throughout. Watch it, watch it, watch it!!
B000UK73QO|5.0|I joined Oprah and Eckhart Tolle on her book reading episodes on-line.  Bought this book so I could read along as they discussed it.  Have highlighted probably every page.  Have enjoyed it very much.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Great game. Very expensive to play if you are wanting quick progress. So just take your time and enjoy the freedom.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Captivating and sophisticated, charming one minute and raucous the next making Ana's character very real. Looking forward to more E L James... and Christian.
B00BGIBVRG|1.0|other than saying i wish i could get my cash back not much. The show was all about how shallow and sad the it is to be part of the LA culture, self-centered, never willing to cut back  (even when they have no cash they still go to a fab vacation spot ) Have to sell thier house cuzz they can't even think of cutting back on keeping up with the illusions of thier life.....bottom line not funny, and i don't see how it could in any way be a part 2 of knocked up...in any way.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Best show I've seen .<br />It's a must see.<br />The only problem is that the episodes are a bit expensive, but its worth it.
B004UPAIDK|4.0|Funny and good a horror classic you can't beat it. Very good part of series although I like army of darkness better.
B008393Q2O|3.0|I think this pretty much sums it up in a nutshell, as others have said. This app has potential and I want like it but without auto save it's not for me. I hit the home button by accident sometimes and doing so with this app means oops, lost everything. I will stick to my color note for now. Fix that and I will have another go to app.
B008NW67E0|5.0|The original numbers are the best. Reminiscent of Simon and Garfunkel but with more urgency and drive. Oddly the cover of Simon and Garfunkels' The Boxer is not as appealing as the original. But the entire album is outstanding. Not a single bad track.
B008KMHFJY|4.0|i liked this - it was really addictive would recommend it (obviously you have to read the first book in the series first)
B009MYAQK4|5.0|Funny how much this reminded me of one of my other all time favorite books 'the prophet' by Khalil Gibran. Coelho weaves words into stories that come alive in my mind, and leave pieces and parts for me to digest later. An excellent read!
B005K17RU0|5.0|this weather app.is great.try it you will like it.its very reliable don't get caught in a hurricane with<br />out this app.
B001AW156U|1.0|If you are buying this to imitate the feel of an Xbox controller, save up your money and buy a controller. Only one of the triggers would attach. Really cheap, low quality. Stay clear.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I DID THE 30 DAY SHRED FOR 30 CONSECUTIVE DAYS<br /><br />I decided to try this DVD because I wanted something intense- I had recently gained 25 pounds (from holiday binging and from a 6-week trip back home to the USA -I live abroad-) Yes 25 pounds in about 3 months (after I had lost those 25 pounds and kept them off for 2 years!)<br />I'm a 5 foot 4ish and started the shred at 172 pounds.<br /><br />I didn't change my diet too much except for paying attention to portion control, only eating when I was truly hungry, and trying to cut out soda and desserts.<br />I did the shred everyday, but not at the same time everyday.<br /><br />The easiest day was day one- why I don't know but maybe because I didn't know what to expect.<br /><br />The hardest days were days 2-6. I wanted to give up. I didn't see how I'd ever move on to workout 2. I wasn't seeing results. (That said, I don't think it was going to be realistic for me to lose 20 pounds in 30 days! My goal was 20 pounds in 3 months) I took it one day at a time.<br />I was VERY surprised at how much I enjoyed the shred. Usually, I look for things I can do to great music, like dancing. Before I did this DVD I kept in shape by doing dance (like zumba type or \\"Just Dance\\". I usually hate aerobic DVD's with the cheap porno-esque music in the background (be forwarned-this DVD has that!) I have pretty much never done weight training in my life! But I sincerely looked forward to this everyday. Something about it- like the counting really appealed to me. Like I just have to get through 2 minutes of cardio until we change activity... it was challenging in a different way. I talked outloud to myself!<br />What Jillian says during workout 1 is true- if you're around day 6 or 7 you really can feel that your endurance and strength are improving. Your muscles stop aching everyday. Starting around day 12-15 I craved more! I felt so amazing and energetic after the workout (whereas after days 1-7 I felt like curling up in a ball andcrying!)<br />I started out with 2 kilo weights (5 lbs) on day 15ish I felt that on many of the strength training exercises I could go up and use heavier weights.<br />I sweat a lot and actually liked it. At the end it felt like I had really worked hard.<br /><br />I moved on slowly. I did do workout 2 once in the beginning and \\"regretted\\" it as it was for the most part too hard for me, BUT that said, I took the bits and pieces from it that I did like, to mix up work out one.<br />Some people said- should I do this workout 2x a day? I moved up slowly. The workout is 3 sets of 3 min strength, 2 min cardio, and 1 min abs... around day 10 I started doing 4 sets. On days I felt good I added low impact cardio at another time during the day- walking, or dancing.<br />I went away for the weekend and was able to keep doing the shred without the DVD in my in-laws basement!!!<br /><br />Something that helped for me was counting how many reps I was doing (usully in workout 1 it is about 15 for strength and maybe 30 for cardio i.e. 30 jumping jacks or 15 bicep curls) counting how many I had left was easier than trying to watch the clock for 30 seconds or just waiting for Jillian to say 2 more!<br />After while I was able to shut off Jillian's voice (there is an option for that) and just focus on doing my moves correctly.<br /><br />On a few days in the beginning I did 'injure' myself- I have a bad knee, and a bad shoulder from years of swimming- so on the days after that I adapted the workout but kept doing it, stayed off the bad knee, or didn't push the shoulder that was hurting, and usually recovered from the pain within a day and was able to continue. It is almost important to stay focused and do all the moves correctly, make sure your feet are grounded because you can easily hurt and ankle.<br />I also have a herniated disc in my lower back so was very careful to adapt some of the exercises- for example I can't do the lower ab reps that lift the pelvis off the ground so I replace that part with something more low impact for my back that still works my abs.<br />Because of my back, in workout 2 for example, I pause the DVD and take some of the exercises slower in the beginning to make sure I am doing them correclty and doing controlled movements.<br /><br />Around day 20 I was flipping through the calendar and saw that I only had about a week left before the end of my goal to do it for 30 consecutive days.... couldn't believe it! Wasn't counting anymore. My muscles are bulging!<br /><br />30 days now and I'm not stopping!<br />I've lost nearly 10 pounds in a month, pretty darn good!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book was a really good book because of all of the imagination and adventures. I suggest  anyone to read this that likes books like this. Great book!
B0001AVZA8|5.0|Speedy mailing, good movie.  Would purchase from this vendor again.<br />Why do these reviews have to be so long?  Short and set usually works, right?
B006LSZECO|5.0|Read like a really good movie. In fact, it should be made into a movie, or maybe not.  Probably wouldn't do it justice.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|Excellent acting by Colin Firth so the Oscar he won was well deserved!  The other Oscars won for the movie were also highly earned.  It was very interesting to learn more about the Royal Family history and this story gave us a glimpse of their trials and tribulations they have dealt with in an honorable manner.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun game. Hours can go by if you're not paying attention. I want to know how to update Sidney, or Rome???
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It is very violent but had me totally tied into it the whole time, good entertainment, not for kids I would say
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|Disappointing that you reach a point in the free where you must pay for additional gold bars in order to unlock some power you unlocked.... why can't you keep playing without it?
1575666286|4.0|There is a lot of good information in here.  I mostly utilize the description of the schedule and the recipes included, but I have yet to read much of the rest of the book.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I honestly can't figure out why people rave about Gone Girl. Even more mystifying is how it manages to stay on the bestseller list for week after week.<br /><br />Without a doubt, this was the worst thirteen dollars I ever spent on a Kindle book.<br /><br />I hate to give up on a book, but this was a real slog to an unsatisfying ending. (My wife says it's because I don't like books about relationships - dysfunctional or otherwise. She's probably right.)
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Good, but not terrific.  If you have read the books you may expect more from the movie.  If not, you will enjoy it.
0307472841|3.0|Okay, but not earth shattering. I just finishing listening to the unabridged audiobook today and frankly, I'm relieved it's over. After a promising debut, the story wandered far too much into the political for my taste. It seems to me as if Henning Mankell set up the initial mystery merely as an excuse to air his views over various political and social issues around the world. I wish this had been written as an historical novel instead with San being the main protagonist.<br />I don't care for politics, so I found myself quite bored at times.<br />As far as the coincidences go, it never was a problem for me. I didn't see that many on the whole. Birgitta Roslin as the main character was a refreshing change from the dashingly handsome, young, sexy and wonderfully intelligent female lead we normally encounter in this type of novels (!). Nice to meet a not-too-skinny older woman.<br />One positive aspect of reading this book: after spending time in Sweden throughout the author's various novels, it is refreshing to realize that the US are not the only country with its share of political turmoil, social upheaval, bribery, greed, etc. I always imagined Sweden as a quaint little country with nice people and sensible political leaders. I guess not.
B0018RC7QE|2.0|The romance between De Niro's character and Streep's was hard to fathom. They had little chemistry, and little in common. Her character was also annoyingly passive. Streep's movie husband did seem very arrogant, but De Niro's movie wife was pretty, kind, and understanding. They had two little boys who seemed adorable and loved their daddy. OK, so desire does come at inconvenient times and sometimes for no good reason, but still, this was a bit of a stretch.<br /><br />And, as other reviewers pointed out, it was a plodding, plotless movie. The two stars shone visually, as they were both very attractive in this earlier stage of their careers. But this alone can't sustain a movie.
B00BFD8AJE|5.0|This is a band that just gets better with age. This is the best album of their illustrious and long career.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|My grandchildren laugh so much while playing w/this app. Even the adults in the family find it amusing. It's a great tool to help lil tikes learn to repeat and learn new words. the possibilities are endless and even better, it was free!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use. I especially like the size of the buttons and read-out. Having it on the Kindle eliminates the need to carry a separate calculator. Jo
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I really liked at first,  but then it stopped working on my kindle fire ans so I deleted it hoping to reinstall it but all it says is open
B00005J6UP|4.0|I love this movie and I was so excited to get it. It was a little scratched but plays good.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Very well put together show about a hero that is rarely given the time of day.  Green Arrow is one of my favorite superheroes and this show does him justice.
B003ZSI7R2|5.0|they were the warm up band for the Who concert here in Columbus, Ohio...The Who needs a warm up band??????<br />got the house jumping'!!!<br />well if they were this good in concert let's get the cd. just as good... a real listener multiple times.<br />good to have a band sounding like the late 50's and 60's!!!
B009M5CJI0|3.0|waited until i finished 'THE FALL OF GIANTS' to start this book and starting it i found page 15 to 46 is missing. an d important part of the set up for the story line. really really disappointed. now what buy another book and hope all the pages are there???????
B00BESFWBY|4.0|We struggle to find a movie that is appropriate to watch with the whole family. This was a wonderfully refreshing movie in that regard. The surfing scenes were amazing and the story is one that will stay with you long after the credits are over.
1400052181|2.0|book club picked and i just could not get started. so i never read it and on the review day with the club just listened and still could not see why it was relative.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Who could dislike a Grisham story ... well-plotted, well-written.  If you like this one, go back and read all the others!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I bought this album having already like a few songs that where on the  album. Having listened to the whole CD it has easily became one of my favourites and I like all the songs. I like that there seems to be a flow to the album as a whole meaning some songs have edge to them and then you transition to &#34;fun&#34; song which then easily goes to a slower song and back again.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved it! On the edge of my seat and never wanted to put it down. Each chapter brings new excitement and adventure. You fall in love with the characters.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Haven't played too far yet but the graphics are well done and the controls and game play are smooth. I haven't rub I to any IAPs yet.
0143039431|5.0|i am a senior in high school and am currently taking AP lit well with the AP test coming up soon i thought it would be a good idea to pick up a few of the novels that appear on the AP test fairly often that i havent already read. so i was looking through the list and i decided to pick up this novel, \\"invisible man\\", and \\"of mice and men\\" and have really enjoyed this novel! i went in knowing it was one of my fathers favorite books so maybe that helped but this novel was soo real and you could feel their pligt throughout the whole thing it was a touching and heart wrenching read. now, what drives me crazy is the reviews saying that high schoolers are too immature to understand the novel and that obviously no teenager would enjoy it and that is simply not true this is one of my favorite novels to date up there with \\"lolita\\", \\"jane eyre\\", and \\"heart of darkness\\" just absolutely wonderful strong novels and just because i am a highschooler doesnt mean i am too imature to understand the complexity of them. but, at any rate, i loved this novel and would recommend it to anyone i love steinbeck and he has proved time and time again he truly does know what he is doing :)
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is by far the best of it kind. For free I like it a lot.. we have fun with it
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Love the box set. Nicely packaged. DVD's are good quality. Each season DVD is colored coded. Have been waiting years to purchase these at a great price.
B004UXUUDA|5.0|This is a story of Compassion vs. Inhumanity.  It has been repeated throughout history mostly to Jews but also people of other faiths and races.  Hiding one's family and name, being raised by different faiths and races.<br /><br />During WWII the French got busy getting along with or subverting the evil in their midst.  To get this movie; have your family identity destroyed or threatened or to know someone who did.  Spend countless hours with those who have been through spiritual/emotional holocausts, and this story has many elements of truth in common with theirs.  Children robbed of innocence, trying to hide a past, trying to be something else because your identity may cost you everything, possibly your own children.  People you trusted turned on you.  People you didn't know came to your rescue.  Strangers raised you and hid your identity within theirs.  People you thought were your enemy, broke the rules that you might escape.  You end up doing the very thing that goes contrary to all humanity \\"think only of yourself.\\"  Your parents don't even trust you and attack your actions.  After all the evil that was done there are no pictures or buildings, even though it took place in broad daylight in a downtown Paris.  Its a story that is untold until a Journalist becomes personally involved.<br /><br />The story of Sarah and the Journalist intertwined as they deal with issues of expediency and doing the right things.  On the surface people who appeared to serve themselves didn't.  People who didn't need to serve themselves did. Sarah's teen lifestyle becomes that of many who have been through a physical or spiritual holocaust.  The Journalist goes on her own wanderings too, to save a life.  In the end someone is restored to their Jewish roots at a time when it is safe to be a Jew again.  Today many people are finding out their Jewish, and Muslims with Christians are finding the Hebrew roots of their faiths.  It is a time for rejoicing and grief.  The truth is the lancet of G-d for our healing.of G-d for our healing.
B00AYXNKIC|4.0|This game is very challenging.  I am very impressed.  I would recommend this game for people that are into driving or motocross games.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I bought these because i work rotating shift, and when i'm on second shift, i typically stay up until 4 or 5 in the morning watching tv etc while my girlfriend sleeps, and they have served the purpose of not annoying her perfectly. The surround sound is amazing, and there's even been quite a few times that i've completely forgotten that i've been wearing them.<br /><br />Some problems though. These things are not perfect, but still totally awesome for the money.<br /><br />First off, if your receiver is near your wireless router, you may experience some signal loss/frequent dropouts, and depending on the strength of your router, you may still experience some issues even if they're each on opposites of the room. A solution to this is to change the channel of your wireless router (do this through your router's internal settings, via their local IP address. Typically 192.168.x.x , with the x's being a combination of 0, 1, and 2. If you've never done this before, you will probably have to find your manual or look on the bottom of your router to find the username and password. Some people have to set their router to channel 1, or some go to channel 11. Ever since i did this, i haven't had a single problem with the signal.<br /><br />Next, these headphones sometimes have a problem with converting a stereo signal to surround sound, where it will sound slightly echoy. The solution for this is really simple. All you have to do is flip the surround sound switch back and forth, and these problems will go away instantly.<br /><br />Lastly, some people have complained about the cheap plastic headband, but i haven't really had any issues with it. I've even used these things while laying down, and never felt like they were about to snap.<br /><br />Despite these problems, this is a pretty amazing headset, and i would still highly recommend them to anyone.
B008220D7S|5.0|Very funny!  You can tell this is a friends/family of comedians!  Paul Rudd is Hilarious and so is Amy Mann!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|There's something grand about this time in our history, its well written and I love the actress from the harry potter movies, can't recall her name right now, but she is such a great character. Bravo!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I bought the first season on dvd, watched it, loved it, and immediately went on amazon to find the second season because I was hooked!! Now I'm chomping at the bit for the third season and I don't have HBO!! If you haven't taken the time to watch Game of Thrones, what are you waiting for?! Do it! watch it, it's awesome!
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|Loved it,  Can't wait to see the next one!  I enjoyed the story line, the special effects and it was true to the previous lord of the rings trilogy
1476715904|5.0|Loved Hopeless by Colleen Hoover and after reading Slammed she is one of my favorite authors. Very touching story and so well written with well crafted characters. Did not know slam poetry but I am a fan now.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I never thought that I would enjoy a Zombie apocolypse movie, but this is so well written and the acting is actually good with a believable plot line
B0086PGCHQ|5.0|You can't ask me to review this album because Metheny is genius no matter what he does. I own pretty much all his cd's and have seen him &#34;live&#34; once a year for the past several years. I love this cd. He takes you to places with his music and you keep coming back for more. Great cd!
B005LAIGZU|5.0|This is a different kind of action movie in that the supporting cast are actors but the solders shown in the field are not actors but real active duty Navy Seals.  It is an outstanding movie that gives a small glimpse into special warfare operations.  They give you a taste of what these incredible operators do, the risks they take, their dedication and motivations for a job they do that for the most part goes unseen by the public.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|great  but make sure you watch season one and two first. character develoment is important.  you will fall in love with cast

B000002LHX|4.0|So many batman movies this one started and yet the music was the best! I'm not even a Prince fan! But the movie made me want the songs. It's the only way to hear the full version of Batdance!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|OMG, I so love the characters.  And the STORY LINE...GASP.  It is a real page turner, and keeps you guessing at what's going to happen next.  And you thought you've seen the worst of humanity?  Not yet you haven't. I can't wait to read the next books to find out what horrible futures await our characters.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This was a good game with good graphics. Wasn't sure when I saw the price but it was well worth the price. Was almost late to work because I couldn't put it down.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Well written, great story and plot.  Characters were well developed and endearing.  Adventures abounding in this book!  A real page turner, keeping me invested and interested in each and every tiny detail.  Made me really long for the final movies!
B00821OX98|4.0|I'm entertained! Always a sucker for a good post apocalyptic story. Not too cheesy and the boys are cute.<br /><br />Keep up the good work with the free prime content
B003O86FMW|5.0|was so excited to continue the story from hunger games.  I can't wait for the movie.  The story always makes me wish the movies could be longer and show the entire book.  lol.  I really enjoyed the plot and climax in this one.  I also grew more fond of the characters and definitely was invested in their well being...so much so that I read it in one day.  Loved it!

B00846WWVM|3.0|Found it difficult to control the hosing apparatus.  Many tries required to get the hang of aiming and finishing on time.
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|To be completely honest, I thought this was a great album. I'm not going to go too in detail on this project, but you can definitely see Tyler's progression on here from Goblin. Lyrics-wise, it's about what you'd expect from a Tyler, The Creator album. It's evident, however, that he put a lot of effort into the production. Overall, I personally enjoyed this album. Tyler's music isn't for everyone, but for those who can get over the shock-value of his lyrics and actually delve deeper into the music and the concepts, there are plenty of good listens to be had from this album.

B008393Q2O|5.0|There's a wide variety of apps for taking notes here in the Amazon Appstore. Some are bare-bones minimal, some are way overblown (and bug-ridden), and a few offer just the right balance for almost any user.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B008393Q2O SkinnyNote Notepad Notes]] is one of those apps that you can easily tailor your way to fit your own needs. When you first install this app, you'll find a good intro and help screen, which can also be accessed at any time from \\"i\\" (info) icon on the lower right side of your screen. This is something that many app developers seem to neglect.<br /><br />This one is easy to use. From the menu, just click on the the \\"+\\" icon to add your note. Within the settings you can change your Font Size from normal (default) to mini, small or large. The Grid Type can be line, grid x 2 or grid x 3. The Default Note Color can be changed to a wide variety, and you can assign labels for each note color. There's an option for note padding, note view size, and you can password protect your notes as well. Backups can be done as well, and you can share your saved notes by email. You can also set up reminders for follow-up on your notes.<br /><br />This SkinnyNote app will take up less than 710KB memory on your Android device in its 1.4.0 version (current at the time of this review), and it's a fast under 10 second download. Tested this on both my [[ASIN:B008GFRE5A Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\"]] and with my [[ASIN:B0097MVKW4 Samsung Galaxy S III Android Phone]], and it worked quite well with both.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B008393Q2O SkinnyNote]] is easy to use, fast to master, and can be customized to fit your own needs. Highly recommended to those who need to take notes and share them.<br /><br />4/10/2013

1594202842|4.0|I admire Amy Chua.<br /><br />There, I said it. Most people probably think she's a horrible child abuser for the things she's made her children endure, but to me? She's basically the most unselfish person I've ever come across. That's why it amazes me that people cut her down for being so dedicated to her children.<br /><br />Forgoing vacations so she can hire expensive violin / piano teachers? Selfless. Spending hours of her time making sure her kids practice? Selfless. Driving hours and hours on a weekend so her kids can take lessons from the best instructors? Selfless. Allowing her children to hate her so that they can (hopefully) be better people? Selfless.<br /><br />I, who can barely find the energy to pick up my 8-year-old's spelling list at the end of a long day at work, can take a lesson or two on what a dedicated parent should be.<br /><br />But that's not to say that Amy Chua isn't slightly off her rocker. I mean, I totally get wanting to have your children put some thought into your birthday, but \\"not accepting\\" a child's homemade birthday card because it's sloppy? That seems harsh. And organizing two hour practice sessions while on vacation? That seems a bit extreme too.<br /><br />A few other things I didn't like about the book as a whole:<br /><br />I would have liked to know more about Amy Chua's approach to academics. Meaning, how did she enforce her children did their homework every day? How did she handle TV time? Was she controlling about what her kids ate and watched too? These are things I struggle with - it would be nice to know her thoughts.<br />Some chapters were utterly boring. I mean, great job on getting your kids to practice for hours Amy, but I seriously had to skim a few pages because I couldn't read about yet another practice.<br />The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Not sure I 100% agree with Amy Chua's method of child-rearing, but since it appears that she's far more successful in her life than I am? Well I can't really judge her parenting theories.<br /><br />I will say that Amy has taught me that in order for my child to be successful, I must play an integral part. And since finishing this book two days ago? I've been making more of an effort to put my computer down and pick up my kid's homework instead. I only hope that I somehow find the tenacity to stick it out.theories.<br /><br />I will say that Amy has taught me that in order for my child to be successful, I must play an integral part.

0670026557|5.0|I've been reading this book for a few days now - finished it yesterday - and I am already finding myself changing a bit of how I operate. According to the book, I am usually a matcher - one who gives reciprocally, when I figure I can receive in return. And there isn't much wrong with that. But, according to Adam Grant and his bevy of research, otherish givers are usually the most successful.<br /><br />So, let me explain.<br /><br />There are three broad styles of interpersonal dealing: taking, matching, and giving. Takers are those who try to take more than they give. Matchers are those who try to give and take proportaionally and conditionally. Givers are those who give more than they take. Takers are primarily self-oriented, matchers are other-oriented as a means to being self-oriented (I'll help you when I think you will help me) and givers are primarily other-oriented.<br /><br />Here's the counter-intuitive part. If we look at the most successful people - the happiest, the most likely to be promoted, etc - they are generally givers, and if we look at the least successful, they too often tend to be givers. (Takers do moderately well, but over time, few want to deal with them. Matchers do okay too.)<br /><br />This book is an attempt to explain why being a giver is a good 'strategy' for success, as well as under what conditions giving is a failing 'strategy.' First, the positive: simply put, people appreciate givers and giving often makes people want to give back. Since givers help others and often put others' needs as a priority, givers often garner (without deliberately trying - AND THAT IS KEY!) a network of support from others they've helped. Want to communicate most effectively? Ask more questions to others than you give answers, ask for advice, and be aware of how you can help others. Want to bring out the best in people around you? Believe in them by recognizing and appreciating their strengths and contributions. Want to be successful? Don't think of personal relations as zero-sum games (where others can only win to the degree you lose), but positive sum games (if you win, it doesn't mean that I lose, but we can all win together).<br /><br />It sounds obvious, right? But it isn't. Even when we may be givers in our personal lives, we often become matchers or takers at work. Even if the success of a giving strategy seems intuitive, it is equally intuitive that getting ahead requires receiving as much as or more than you get, spending most of your time working on things that will obviously benefit you, and not spending more time assisting others at work than getting your own stuff done. But Grant cites a growing body of research showing that giving - under the right conditions - really is the best overall 'strategy.'<br /><br />Of course, I said \\"under the right conditions.\\" What are those conditions? Well, for starters, one must give with some sort of purpose. Those who don't see some sort of result from their giving often burn out. (So, fundraising telemarketers burn out less when they can talk with those who their efforts have helped, and teachers burn out less when they see what their more successful students go on to do.) Also, one must give to others and things that the giver is interested in. (Volunteering for projects and to help people I care about is much easier and fun than for those I care little about.) Lastly, one must watch out not to be exploited by takers, who can often seem like givers in their agreeableness, but be exploitative in the end. (And Grant gives some good advice on how to detect real givers versus takers who are good actors.)<br /><br />So, all of this is what Grant calls 'otheerish giving.' Giving selflessly versus giving a bit selfishly is, Grant writes, what ultimately separates successful from unsuccessful givers. Give, but make sure one is giving with a sense of purpose, and to people and things one cares about. Give, but not when it comes AT THE EXPENSE of one's own projects.<br /><br />And this is the one area of criticism I have for Grant's otherwise well-written and VERY interesting book. He doesn't do a great job distinguishing between matchers (those who give when they think there will be something for them in return), and otherish givers (those who give selectively). .On its face, I think I have an understanding of the difference, but the ideas are very closely related.<br /><br />One other small area of criticism: does it make sense to urge others to give, but then point out that giving is a good strategy to success? If one adopts giving as a strategy for success, then doesn't that mean, in a sense, that they are takers (giving because they expect to gain more than they give ultimately)? Grant warns against this tendency, telling us that giving because one expects ultimate benefits - is often a self-defeating strategy that others can detect. But, doesn't the mere fact that Grant's whole point is to show that and how giving is ultimately a winning strategy mean that many people WILL adopt it somewhat artificially because they expect a payoff? (I don't see how its avoidable.)<br /><br />Anyway, I did gain a lot from this book. Not only have I found myself monitoring some of my interpersonal dealings by the advice given in this book, but it's given me insights into what working styles many of my colleagues have (which affects how I deal with them). Very good book that not only conveys some very interesting research, but should be able to give people some good and usable advice.<br /><br />Oh, and as a final teaser... chapter 3 explains why Jonas Salk - typically renowned as a giver for refusing to patent his polio vaccine - is actually a taker.r />And this is the one area of criticism I have for Grant's otherwise well-written and VERY interesting book.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|King probably should star in my list of favorite writers: he is brilliant but I don't rush to read his books. Probably a throwback from the early 80s when my young teen self scoffed at the constant parade of films based on his books. I have only read several of his books. Honestly I am daunted by their size, but maybe I hold off so as to be able to slowly savor the treats. His horror books scare the bejeezus out of me in a good way. I have often heard that King can't write romance, but this book proves the skeptics beautifully wrong. Combine the romance with a time travel to prevent one of the most fascinating, and in my opinion, tragic historical events and you have a brilliant book.<br /><br />I was really touched by the romance in this book, probably because I fully did not expect it. But it is not sentimental and sappy. The characters don't fall in love at first sight and their relationship is fraught with obstacles that they work together to overcome. George/Jake travels back in time to stop a calamity and never imagined finding the love of his life. It's just too bad it's not enough for him to leave history alone.<br /><br />My main reason for not going for a full five star rating, and honestly 4.5 is my true rating, is the middle of the book. George can only travel back in time starting in 1958, so he has 5 years to hang out until the JFK assassination. That's a long time to fill and in the middle of the book, I got a little bored. King manages to keep enough tension going to make it not too painful to trudge through, but why not have the time portal start only 2 or 3 years before the assassination?<br /><br />As I read this book, I found myself falling down the JFK assassination rabbit hole due to the incredible humanization of the Oswald family. I wanted to know how accurate the incidents depicted were and what became of Oswald's family. The Oswald parts felt like an Eric Larson book: historical facts in a compelling narrative style. While I never sympathized with Lee himself, I couldn't help but feel for his wife and the future of his children.<br /><br />Finally the theme of this book left me with much to ponder. That time and events cannot be changed so we have to make the most of our time and not live with regrets. We shouldn't try to change the past but even the smallest things we do in our lives can have massive effect and therefore we should strive to make them count.

Unfortunately for me, the movie kept stoping and reloading itself. at first I thought it was my computer until I started watching something on Netflix and Hulu. This happened two days in a row. Since it looks like I am unable to get a refund I am forced to give this movie 1 star
B003E2UQMS|4.0|Very enjoyable read. Felt the emotion of the main character pat through the whole story. Couldn't put the book down

B0064MGU98|5.0|I just discovered this show - it's addictive.  Characters are intriguing and each episode is complete and a yet cliffhanger at the same time
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I would like to first start off saying this season came in speedy fast from my favorite seller.<br /><br />This is a very good show to get into either now or in the past. The cover featured the main character Walter White who is diagnosed with Lung Cancer and finds a way to get money to get treatments as well as money saved away for his family when he passes away. He starts cooking meth with a former high school chemistry student. It is a nonstop roller coaster of a show and I ordered this because I am anticipating the fifth season to come out.<br /><br />Some things you need to know about this season in particular are:<br /><br />1) This season is only 7 forty-five minute episodes.<br /><br />2) You might want to get this and season 2 (13 episodes) due to the fact it just ends on a cliffhanger.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I love this book. It keeps you on your toes and wanting to read more. It also gives you hope that you can find love wherever and whenever.

B0092MKTL2|5.0|I was just going to buy \\"Radioactive\\" when I first looked at this album because it was stuck in my head... But then I listened to the samples of the other songs and I just decided to purchase the whole thing. I glad, \\"Tiptoes\\" has probably become my favorite song on the album & the rest of the songs just get better the more you listen to them. And no two songs \\"sound\\" exactly alike, it's a really great mix of styles & instruments that provides variety while still sounding like the all belong on the same album. I highly recommend this group!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Best love series I've ever read! You will not regret purchasing these books! Grab this book instead of watching television x

B001H9MYPW|5.0|Season Two just as brilliant as Season 1<br />Gabriel Byrne sits in this role as if it were made for him and delivers all that is expected with compasion and a genuine quality.<br />Dianne West (Gina) also fulfills her role with the same passion and committment.<br />Paul Westons' clients' stories are so real in the portrayal of their characters and just engross you to keep on watching to reach the outcome.<br />Of course this is all backed up by the brilliant writers, who portrayed such an authentic realness to the stories.<br />Just cannot wait for Season 3 to arrive and hope there is a season 4.

B0010SKUYM|5.0|The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss was recommended to me by a bookstore owner in Chincoteague, VA when I was picking up a copy of Storm of Swords. He said that if I liked Game of Thrones and the ASOIAF books, that I would love this one. I ended up buying it that day but not reading it for another year after that. Boy do I regret doing so. If I would have known what I know now, I would have put Storm of Swords aside and immediately began this novel. Instead I waited and started listening to it instead. The result was the same though, I finished an amazing book with a wonderful story, smart chracters, and a thirst for more.<br /><br />The story takes place in a fantasy land with the main character being Kvothe. Kvothe is on the run and hiding in some far away small town living as an innkeeper. A man named Chronicler finds Kvothe and recognizes him and his notorious past. Kvothe agrees to tell him his story over the span of three days (each book is a day, this being the first) and the journey begins.<br /><br />Kvothe's story starts well enough but is soon wrapped in tragedy. Out of tragedy comes strength and Kvothe follows his dreams until he is studying magic at the University. It's here that most of the book's larger events take places and he meets the love of his life. I won't spoil much but things take place that start Kvothe's journey and set things up nicely for the next two days (books.)<br /><br />This book comes highly recommended and the audio recording (you can get at audible) is a perfect companion to reading the book (that's how I read my novels - some at home and listen in the car.) Hopefully my review has helped you towards a purchase because this is one hell of a story and Patrick Rothfuss has become a favorite of mine.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Denzel really shows what kind of seasoned actor he really is. Great special effects too! I will see it again!
B008RNGCAO|2.0|I know this is supposed to be a classic Batman tale but Dixon and the others' writing smacks of Golden Age cliches and there are way too many expository internal monologues. The non-action parts are soap opera bad.<br />A more economical approach to the writing and less dreadful poetry masquerading as description and this might be a decent book. Really it's just a relic, a good example of why DC stunk in the 90's.<br />Decent origin story of Bane but skip this tale is my take. Go read No Man's Land.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome app<br />Well this app was very fun<br />The only problem was the horses cost to much money or gems
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|This movie was a story of survival. It featured a boy on a boat in the middle of the ocean for the majority of the film. There were some long, drawn out parts that could have been shortened. My kids (12, 11, 9) sat through the entire thing, but all of us agreed we would probably never watch it again. The graphics were nice, lots of bright colors and scenes. The violence was mild, there were some animals that were killed. The ending was surprising (no spoiler alert) but tied the whole movie together so it made more sense. I don't recommend it for children younger than 9 who don't like killing animals though. Good one time movie, glad we only rented it. Nice way to pass a chilly afternoon.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I drive an hour to work it is great to know what the weather is going to do before I head out.

B00AAX68HG|5.0|Great game for kids and adults. No hidden costs that I could which is a real plus these days. Some of the levels are much easier than others but that's what makes a good game.
B008Q08EV8|1.0|I was so bored. I lost interest after the first half hour and ultimately fell asleep... Terrible , boring, bland, dry and only worth watching if you need a nap.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|WHEN I FIRST STARTED TO READ THE BOOK I WONDERED WHAT THE HECK I WAS READING.  MADE MYSELF READ MORE AND FINALLY GOT IN TO IT, THEN REALLY INTO IT. I HATED TO PUT IT DOWN.  GOOD READING TOO WHEN IN THE DOCTORS OFFICE AS WELL.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I beat all the levels on hard easy and mediam and it was awesome this game is so worth the money
B000MNOX7Q|3.0|Very intriguing.  Reminded me of a Twilight Zone episode about halfway through but still enjoyable (my wife wanted to see it uncut and complete when she caught the first half on cable).  Like 'Mulholland Drive' or 'Memento', you might need to keep notes to track characters and events so it all ties together.  Good characters and well acted for the most part.  Some night exterior scenes were too murky for my taste but that's a style now.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|It took a while, but once into this book I couldn't put it down.<br />The characters were amazingly real. I will remember them for a long time.

If you're a Blues fan in your soul, there is no doubt in my mind that Buddy will make it into your personal top five with one listen.  Many people have this or that negative to say, but I have never been disappointed in a Buddy Guy album as a whole and I have nearly all of his work.  Just ordered 'Buddy's Baddest' this morning.
B006JRY2QG|5.0|I think this is very entertaining and exciting I hate having to wait for the next week, and I really dislike when the season ends. Overall I would recommend this series to anyone that love's a good story and gr8 excitement<br /><br />  Sincerely<br />  Bob F.

B004P1JEXE|2.0|Boring, boring, boring.  Skipped through the pages to find the main characters.  Dont understand the need to kill off everyone either.  The characters introduced did not fit well and werent interesting enough to even be in the book.  Way too much going on.  Still getting book 5 though...surely will be better than this one

B008JMKN4Y|3.0|mostly a novel for young adults.not a great story that you want to tell your friends to read.the late teens or college kids probably liked it better than me.
B004P1JEWU|3.0|It's an okay read.  Too many non essential characters being introduced though.  A good read when story is focused on the main characters.

B0070Y46UY|4.0|it was a good story.i didn't give it 5 stars because it got tiresome on the number of days on the lifeboat.all ages would get something out of the book.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|Very timely arrival and awesome entertainment everyone can view!  This series takes me back to an interesting time in history and is as accurate as possible.  It also includes subjects that come up in our family and how to deal with them, teaching good values and how to accept different kinds of people.  I feel good after watching it.

B002QFYJF4|3.0|Anderson claims he had all these disparate stories he wanted to tell but didn't know how it could be done until he saw Altman's Short Cuts. He uses Altman alumni in his cast as an homage, including Nashville veterans Michael Murphy and Henry Gibson (the latter is particularly good as a cynical world-weary aging homosexual). Unlike Altman, there's far less improvisation going on and the actors stay pretty close to the script.<br /><br />The film is wildly ambitious but doesn't entirely succeed, as a recent revisiting demonstrated to me. Anderson probably started from the central, haunting and Biblical image of a rain of frogs and saw it as a way to tie these stories together in thematic unity. The frog sequence IS magical and has always astonished me, and I imagine even those who find this the most boring movie they've ever seen suddenly perked up when they saw this sequence. It still doesn't entirely validate many of the depressing stories we've been spending 3 hours with. Julianne Moore and William H. Macy--both great character actors--have roles so stupidly conceived there were times I actually felt bad for the actors. Henry Gibson deserves note for helping to keep afloat his scenes with Macy as a self-pitying former game show train wreck. I blame Anderson more than the actors as the flaw is in the conception, not the execution. Cruise's performance drew distinction for bringing to life a scumbag of a misogynist. A streetwise black kid plays some kind of rapping \\"prophet\\"  whose words might portend important changes for the characters, but I do not think the film profound enough for me to revisit those scenes to scour for hidden meaning. The  quiz show sequences felt particularly silly to me as no American game show would require their participants to have such far-reaching knowledge like quoting the exact lyrics from Bizet's Carmen. I know the film is reaching for surreal effects, but the ridiculousness of  it kept throwing me emotionally out of the movie.<br /><br />Those of us who admired Altman of course have a special regard for Paul Thomas Anderson. I follow anything he does and think There Will Be Blood is one of the great American films. But he made Magnolia when he was 28. It strains to present emotionally grueling stories that are not backed up by the wisdom that comes from experience. Altman is a filmmaker whose works I can appreciate as I get older because they are born from experience. He didn't even become the artist we know until he was in his 40's. I am not convinced Paul Thomas had actually truly sympathized with these lowlifes he put on the screen. I have to regard it as an ambitious failure but very useful for Paul Thomas to teach him the lexicon of film and different modes of storytelling techniques. Considering that most Hollywood products are formulaic genre pictures as predictable as they are forgettable, I admire a film like Magnolia because it's trying something new, even if it doesn't finally succeed.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Excellent reworking of the Sherlock Holmes canon to current times.  The screenplay writers have actually read Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and showed respect for his stories.

A road more demanding but more reliable in return. We do not take a big risk with Coelho because there is love on both ends (beginnings) of his road.

B00BQ1DAHC|4.0|It's pretty simple. I typically listen to harder rock than Volbeat yet their music has always appealed to for whatever reason. I don't question why, I just listen and enjoy. I like what I am hearing from the new guitar sound/style/etc. It's not that different, but the minor nuances in guitar appeal to my ears. Bottom line...I dig it. 4 songs made it to my gym playlist and that says something in my book. This is a solid album that will not disappoint existing Volbeat fans.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I have been watching Firefly for years. The variety of episode topics and characters make it interesting. Of course, it is grade A Sci Fi.

Can't recommend more, Firefly and Amazon Prime Instant Video!

B000ICXQGK|1.0|Everything was ok right until the moment his wife died, comitted suicide,then it started to freeze then the screen went all completely blue, we waited a couple of minutes then it continued but this time it had no sound and you couldnot pause or rewind or FF so we had to stop watching the movie. I dont know if this is Amazon's or Roku's fault.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I thought this movie was going to be hilarious, it wasn't.  I enjoyed it and even laughed out loud a couple times, but most of the funny parts were already in the trailer.
B007XNAPNY|5.0|Can't explain how this band has inspired me over the years. Even the years that I didn't love the music they put out, the fact they weren't afraid to try new things and kept it together for so long amazes me. Love the latest record (they'll always be records to me), and can't wait for #14. Ronson really brought them full circle with All You Need is Now and it's the first record since Rio that I love every song on it.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|A good break from the &#34;50 shades&#34; types of books. Lighthearted and fun! Looking forward to more books by this author.
B00873GRU4|5.0|With the inconspicuous title of 'Wool' I barely gave this book a second look, until I noticed the number of 5 star reviews. So I bought the Kindle version and was hooked from the first page. This is post apocalyptic science fiction at its absolute best.<br /><br />With characters that you care for, this world is steeped in mysteries that keep you turning the pages. What is it that happened to the world? How is it that generation after generation have lived deep underground in this weirdly setup silo? Or is everything the characters see and believe nothing but lies and deception?<br /><br />I would have given it 6 stars were it possible...
B001ILFUD2|4.0|Not seen it yet, again this was a birthday gift that will be watched on car trips & at home...

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great story...well written...bummed that there wasn't more to keep reading. Wool is areal 'flashlight under the covers' book that you just want to read in one go...awesome new world to explore. Details did not intrude, but built the silo in mind.

B00000JR2A|5.0|There's so much good going on with this album.  I listened to it before going on to listening to Everybody Loves A Happy Ending, as I'd heard that album was a natural continuation of this one.  I'm glad I did (I didn't want to make the same mistake I made in listening to Raoul before Elemental) because Seeds Of Love deserves to stand on its own without being overshadowed.  These guys have never made the same album twice, which is a mistake so many artists seem to make.  I love the big sounds on this album, and the quieter moments serve as a nice counterpoint.  I have to give Woman In Chains a special shout-out; that's the song (and video) that started me on my path of rediscovery of this band.  It's in a class all its own.<br /><br />Favorite tracks:  Seeds Of Love, Badman's Song, Swords and Knives, Famous Last Words<br /><br />The ones that snuck up on me:  Year Of The Knife, Johnny Panic And The Bible Of Dreams
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Great product  especially good to all the extras that came bundled in this set.<br />My daughter loves the music box
B000001DYY|5.0|I made the mistake of listening to Elemental out of chronological order.  Raoul And The Kings Of Spain arrived first and like a kid at Christmas, I ripped into it without thinking to wait.  Its hold on me is such that I'm afraid Elemental suffered a little bit by comparison.  With that said, though, there isn't a thing wrong with Elemental, and in fact, it contains some of my favorite songs.  There's not a weak track on it, in my opinion.  Even Fish Out Of Water, the infamous diss track, is well-done.<br /><br />Favorite tracks:  Cold, Break It Down Again, Elemental, Mr. Pessimist.<br /><br />The one that snuck up on me:  Dog's A Best Friend's Dog.  At first, this song was a WTF moment for me, but it stuck with me and demanded another go.  It's so dang much fun to sing; it's one of those songs that makes you feel like a badass.  :D
0143119680|5.0|thank you deborah harkness for this wonderful series of stories, i listened to them on tape first now im reading them in print. the story takes my breath away. i cant wait for the third story in the series but i will be so depressed when i finally finish it! lol it is like part of my life now.

B004EPYZQ2|2.0|Great direction, great cinematography, it started out as a Stand By Me sort of film, that lost its way with an alien that in the end didn't matter. Kyle Chander's character was totally irrelevant to all that went on, as was the alien, who gave the word junkyard a whole new meaning. But I have never been a fan of Spielberg.<br /><br />ET: a group of kids find the first extraterrestrial to visit earth, and, rather than trying to learn something about it, simply play with it.<br />Close Encounters of the Third Kind: more extraterrestrials come to earth, who, despite all of their advanced technology, can only communicate through five notes of music. And, it seems, they've been abducting humans for centuries. Anal probes anyone?<br />Jaws: what started out with one of the most horrific scenes in film history, quickly degenerates into a near comedy.<br />The Color Purple: the movie was okay, but the end result was the creation of a billionaire called Oprah, whose mere words have influenced the shape of the planet.<br />Poltergeist: Don't even make me go there.<br />Gremlins: I only watch it because of Phoebe Cates. And damn Kevin Kline! He got to be married her :(
B008YU0AOE|3.0|it has too many buttons for me to figure out!  I'm sure they work fine however all I needed was a plain ol' calculator.  Nothing this fancy.  For the low price, it would be well worth the cost.
B005K17RU0|2.0|I loved this app till the update. Used it all the time and loved to read the weather articles .  App crashes when I try to view the maps on my android phone and the maps lock up my kindle fire forcing me to reboot.  uninstalled on both devices till problems are fixed.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Great read! There's so much detail, that you just get caught up in the story-never wondering where it's going; just being content to let it take you there. You'll never guess the ending.

B004PIA4BI|5.0|This battery holds a charge and works like new. Would recommend to anyone who needs a new or spare battery.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Thought that this would be a &#34;chick flick&#34; and did enjoy watching it with female friends. Would be a great movie for couples to watch together, especially if you've been together for a long while and feel like you are drifting apart. Shows how important communication is in any relationship.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Love it! I have a DSLR, lenses, and a few point and shoots that all fit and store easily in this backback. All of the AC adapters and miscl cords fit as well. Well designed and rugged. Thanks for a great product!

B0012GMXLU|5.0|Motorhead's ninth studio album, 1991's \\"1916,\\" is easily their best effort of the decade (the 1990's). It sees the band maturing their songwriting approach a little, adopting pop-like hooks (even if they have been dragged through the muck), and some honest-to-god, well-written melodies. Heck, even a few progressive-sounding tunes make their way into the mix, here. But even if they do scale things back for a moment of restraint from time to time, MH always sound unquestionably inspired.<br /><br />And that is not to say that there isn't plenty of heavy material on tap, here. Take, for example, the fun-lovingly heavy \\"I'm So Bad\\" (which features noteworthy lyrics, absolutely catchy vocals -- including an instantly memorable chorus that should be a staple in Motorhead's live show someday soon -- and a cool, shredding solo), and the whammy-bar heavy \\"Shut You Down,\\" which is an irresistibly blistering and propulsive speed metaller (and the seemingly long lost sequel to MH's world-renowned \\"Ace Of Spades\\"). Both of these tracks prove that this band can still rock really hard and raucously, as they both rip from start to finish, but sacrifice none of their sonic heaviness in favor of speed. \\"Make My Day\\" is another epic shred-fest, and a fiery and up-tempo cut of no-holds-barred speed metal. It has a thunderous bass bottom; but its real highlight is its epically epic and excellent soloing. (It even has one solo section that is well-over a minute and twenty-seconds in length!) Elsewhere, set opener \\"The One To Sing The Blues\\" is armed with an introductory drum solo, prominent bass lines (Lemmy's bass grumbles along like an irritated bowel), rhythmic, toe-tappable beats, and groovy guitar hooks. It also uncorks two more exceptional solos (the first of which is great and wailing, the second wild and shredding).<br /><br />Phil \\"Wizzo\\" Campbell and Wurzel continue to proudly show-off their soloing skills throughout later cuts such as \\"No Voices In The Sky\\" and \\"Going To Brazil.\\" The former song finds him ripping out two memorable solos, the second of which is an especially excellent, epic, lengthy and winding one. And they are both anchored by Lemmy's punk-like, beeping, grumbling bass notes. And the latter tune is another terrifically catchy and rhythmic toe-tapper of a song with gobs more wailing, vertigo-inducing, whammy-bar-drenched soloing. \\"Nightmare/The Dreamtime\\" is another big standout, but not because of its guitar solo work. Sure, it does have plenty of more tasty shredding, but it is pushed to the background, here, in favor of Lemmy's flinty, gruff, crooning vocals and an insidiously dense, foggy atmosphere and electronic music-derived keyboards. \\"Nightmare\\" also has noteworthy lyricism throughout, as it deals with darkly depressing subjects such as death, drugs, and Golgotha. And the succeeding \\"Love Me Forever\\" is another really dreary, restrained, and grim near-ballad. It does gain some momentum through the use of its unorthodox, shredding, off-the-rails guitar soloing, and loud (and, therefore, eminently memorable) choruses. But for the most part, this is a thoroughly mid-tempo song, and one that is occupied by somber, ambient acoustic guitar strumming and clean singing.<br /><br />\\"Angel City\\" puts the listener back in more familiar territory again, as an up-tempo and feel-good hard rocker with sing-along-worthy vocals and beer-drenched, party-themed lyrics. Then, when strong, grumbling bass lines, and mazy, winding, shred-tastic, air-guitar-able solo runs are added to the mix, and the end result is a product that would make a great soundtrack to your next kegger. And skipping ahead a track, \\"Shut You Down\\" continues in the same manner as \\"Angel City,\\" as a brutal blast of pure, unadulterated punk-metal. It might last all of ninety seconds, but it is still a big standout, thanks to its hard-rockin' main groove, and choruses that are just plain unforgettable. (Only Lemmy could turn a line as simplistic as the title phrase -- spelling out \\"R-A-M-O-N-E-S\\" -- into a refrain that is truly anthemic.) As such, this obvious homage to one of Motorhead's biggest influences, the punk-rock outfit The Ramones, is guaranteed to rattle around your head for at least one solid day.<br /><br />But the set's unquestionably biggest highpoint comes in the form of the bookending title song. \\"1916\\" (the song), with its mournful organ, violin, and piano/keyboard flourishes, as well as use of melodic strings, martial, war-sounding electronic drum beat, and excellent, accomplished crooning, is a superbly moving and affecting piece of modern rock balladry. And if this wasn't enough, then Mr. Kilmeister's noteworthy lyrics -- which detail World War One's killings -- should do the trick: Putting a lump in the throat of even the manliest of men. (See lines like \\"16 years old when I want to the war\\" and \\"Ten thousand slain/and now, there's nobody that remembers our names.\\") All told, this is, aside from maybe \\"Don't Let Daddy Kiss Me\\" (which was released on 1993's \\"Bastards\\") quite possibly the best ballad Motorhead have ever penned. And it is also, very likely, deserving of being lumped in amongst all of heavy metal's all-time strongest and most memorable ballads.<br /><br />Abrasive, contagious, well-rounded, impeccably played, and tough-as-nails, \\"1916\\" has everything it needs to be labeled a classic Motorhead record. This is evidenced by the fact that it was nominated for a Grammy at the 1991 music awards. But even though it would not win the award, this reviewer firmly believes that it should have. And when considering the high-quality caliber of the competition of metal releases that came out that year (see also: Metallica's \\"Black Album,\\" Suffocation's \\"Effigy Of The Forgotten,\\" Ozzy Osbourne's \\"No More Tears,\\" Sepultura's \\"Arise,\\" etc.), that is really saying something!

B00B2YH7D6|5.0|When I heard some of the talk show hosts praising Dave Grohl for making this documentary, I knew it had to be good and I pre-ordered it. I was not disappointed at all.  In fact, we have watched it several times and have invited guests over to see it, too.  They also loved it.<br /><br />I was a part of the music scene in Los Angeles in the mid to late Sixties and cannot believe I had never heard of Sound City.  Of course that was actually before it opened.  So this very well done documentary filled in a knowledge gap that I did not know I had.<br /><br />It was so interesting how Dave wove his and Nirvana's story into the documentary, starting out with their drive to Los Angeles twenty-two years ago.  As Dave said, it changed his life.  The documentary incorporates some incredible footage of those days as well as very telling photos of the people and the groups that recorded at Sound City.  Some of the highlights of the film are the interviews with former staff members, owners and recording technicians that permeate this documentary.  It is their story and they tell it very well.<br /><br />The interviews also include many with some of the artists who recorded there.  Included are members of Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty, Nirvana, Neil Young and so many more.  Relating their experiences recording at Sound City demonstrate why this was such a special place and some of the secrets that made Sound City such a success.<br /><br />The engineers and staff discuss their perspective on what made Sound City so in demand by recording artists.  Of course it was the sound resulting in the large recording studios that impressed so many artists.  But the secret weapon of Sound City was the recording console, only one of four made in the world.  There was nothing like it in the Los Angeles recording scene.<br /><br />The film also points out how a changing recording industry was finally the death knell for Sound City as the industry evolved from analog to digital.<br /><br />In the end, you see what eventually became of the recording console.  And the reunion of the artists who recorded at Sound City in the past is great and results in some very fine music.<br /><br />I highly recommend this documentary.  It is quality through and through.  Five stars!, you see what eventually became of the recording console.

B002ZG9846|5.0|If you ever thought you would like to be a super hero (and don't tell me you haven't) then this movie is what you need to see. No need to tell you comic book fans as you have already seen it. This movie is great! And funny. Too bad Hollywood is too stupid to have made this. It took the Brits to do an American movie. Perfect companion to &#34;Paul&#34; which was also done by the Brits.
B000AP04OM|5.0|I just love this movie!  It's so Disney and who cares that it's almost completely inaccurate to the family's real life, lol.  I watch it because it feels good, but if you're looking for the Von Trapp family's real life story, this isn't it.  Watch it for laughs, entertainment and to sing along.  Great for the kids and a sweet love story.

I know I will reread it, possibly skipping the orphanage scenes, but in all honesty, those scenes make the character of Jamie come alive. Rose McFadden and Lydia Devine are also well drawn and allowed to be complex.  Well worth your time.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed all three books. Wish there were more to read. I had a hard time putting<br />the book down.
B00BLGXL3U|4.0|Fascinating film! If you've read \\"Inside Scientology\\" by Janet Reitman or \\"The Bare-faced Messiah\\" by Russell Miller, this film will make much better sense. All allegory aside, this is a pretty close expose of the formative years of Dianetics and Scientology (processing = auditing, etc)... and all of the attendant reality-twisting, mind-control methods developed by L Ron Hubbard and his minions. Check out the videos of LRH on YouTube and you will see Philip Seymour Hoffman does an accurate, if kind, portrayal of \\"the Commodore.\\" I think the film also speaks volumes about Scientology's claims to cure mental illness yet disparaging all forms of psychiatry... while, ironically (or not!), creating and sustaining itself on a dissociative disorder phenomenon among its adherents. IMHO!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|The characters seem so real and you make a connection with them when you read the books or watched season one, so when you see even more bad things happening to these people it really keeps you on the edge of your seat. Nothing ever goes right in the Game of Thrones, but it's met by just enough humor, romance, and dragons to not be over filled with angst. The show has created a great balancing act and so far they haven't fallen.<br /><br />There are some changes from the book, like any adaptation will have, though it's disappointing to see some awesome parts missing, it's so gratifying when they get most of it perfect or add something that just pulls it all together. Like the scenes where Arya Stark and Tywin Lannister have there little conversations, it's just great and enjoyable while still seems to go together with the whole show. It also makes Tywin more rounded and less of just this embodiment of evil.<br /><br />Over all it's better than first season and will blow your mind so just watch it already.

B00BRYDKM8|5.0|Why can some speakers grab the attention of an audience and keep them spellbound throughout their entire presentation, but most fall flat on their faces and are quickly forgotten?<br /><br />Akash Karia answers this, and many more questions in his terrific new book, How to Deliver the Perfect TED Talk.  Akash has captured the best ideas, tools, and processes used by some of the best speakers and presenters in the world.  He has distilled them in to a step-by-step, easy-to-read guide that will help you discover, develop, and deliver presentations which help you stand out from the crowd.<br /><br />Actually, the title is slightly misleading in one sense - these ideas aren't limited to TED Talks.  They can be used for any type of presentation, whether a 5-minute talk at a networking event, a 20-minute presentation at a local Rotary or Chamber meeting, or a one-hour keynote speech.<br /><br />Although there are dozens of ideas you can immediately implement into your speech, three that jump out right away are:<br /><br />1) Creating an Attention-Grabbing Opening - use these ideas to quickly pull the audience into your speech and make them want to hear more<br />2) Using Statistics to Grab Attention - avoid mistakes most speakers make when they use numbers to bore their audiences<br />3)  Offer the Audience Something New - this chapter alone is worth the price of the book, as Akash challenges you to provide your audience with a new point of view or approach to your subject.  Audiences desperately want this today.<br /><br />Whether you are a new speaker learning the art of speaking, or a veteran looking for a new perspective,  How to Deliver the Perfect TED Talk is a wise investment that can help take your speaking to a higher level.<br /><br />Michael Davis, Speaking CPR<br />Certified World Class Speaking Coach

B0084B1T8Y|5.0|The Jungle Book will be loved by children. As you read this book you will be immersed in the jungle playing with Mowgli and enjoying the jungle. The way each animal has been portrayed is so endearing that children will love them. This book is an exciting, fun filled adventure in the jungle with Mowgli and his close friends. The character Baloo the bear is so adorable. Kids will love this book and keep reading it again and again. Five stars from me.

B009IUH1N2|4.0|I loved this game. It was a fun running platform game that wasn't so easy i got really bored after level two. There was enough challenge in the levels that I had to redo a couple times to get all the gems, but not hard enough that I have up. The whole point of the game is to get a healing stone in the past for your sick teacher. The levels have three gems you have to collect in order to get to the main boss. The bosses, however, are pretty much run and not get killed until they tire out.<br /><br />As a note: in the game, you are given 10 \\"redos\\" that turn back time a couple of seconds when you die. However, this is a total of 10 for the entire game (excluding free run). You can get more by following the developers via Facebook and Twitter, each giving you five. Or you can pay for more with real money or win them via endless run.<br /><br />There were some issues with the game so that I couldn't give it five stars. There were times when I would hit a \\"step\\" and as I try to jump up to continue, my guy wouldn't respond quick enough and I'd lose. Or, if I hit those dinosaurs and, again, my guy wouldn't respond quick enough. This seemed to only happen when I was too close to the screen. However, there were times when I was in the same situation and he responded perfectly fine.<br />There were also some \\"flashes\\" and skips in time during gameplay that, most times, caused me to lose or miss a gem. This didn't happen a lot, but it did happen too much for me, especially on the levels I had to repeat a couple of times.<br /><br />Overall, the graphics are nice and cute. The music was fast paced and gave a feeling of needing to hurry, but a bit overbearing and I couldn't have my volume up over half. I liked the story was set in comic book style. I think 99¢ is a perfect price for this game. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes runner games.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I so loved Holden and Sky, what a love story about two people that are really soulmates. This book was so emotional and what these young adults had to go through was heartbreaking.  The way Holden loved and took care of Sky was breathtaking.  Can't wait to see how the story continues.
B007REV4YI|3.0|I'm not the biggest Bond fan, but I've seen a majority of them, from the classics starring Sean Connery and Roger Moore to the newer movies with Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig. For the most part, I've enjoyed the over-the-top, almost cartoonish style of espionage that the series is known for, although the Daniel Craig movies seem to take a more serious stab at it. I, like many people, enjoyed the franchise reboot with Casino Royale, but was disappointed with the non-stop car chase that was Quantum of Solace. I had heard good things about Skyfall and went into this Blu-ray with high hopes.<br /><br />First, the good: The Blu-ray transfer is astounding. The clarity of every shot, every scene is phenomenal. Nearly every scene is framed beautifully, and the sets are gorgeous. There are sweeping shots of cities and mountain vistas that are breathtaking, and the hyper-clarity of 1080p is truly the definition of perfect. Now, I'm not some casual movie watcher; when I watch Blu-ray, I scrutinize every detail with an eagle eye. So when I say this movie is sharp, those aren't empty words.<br />Another positive for Skyfall is the story. I had some issues with the moment to moment details, but there aren't any glaring plot-holes, and the story is easy to understand.<br />The acting is also solid, although I don't care much for Javier Bardem. There's something about the way he plays \\"evil\\" that I don't like. Everyone else, from 007, to M, to Q, to Moneypenny, all do a fine job. Maybe not Oscar-worthy, but good.<br />In the sound department, this movie also excels. It was nominated for best sound editing and sound mixing (I don't remember if it won), and with good reason. When you watch an explosive action movie like Bond, you have certain expectations. It has to sound larger-than-life while also retaining a believable, \\"realistic\\" feel. This, I imagine, must be a delicate balancing act, and one that is pulled off exceptionally well. The HD audio of Blu-ray does a great job of preserving the fidelity of the movie's audio.<br /><br />Now, the not so good: *MINOR SPOILERS FOLLOW* Bond has always been a cartoon character of sorts. His aim is perfect. He has access to gadgets that would only come in handy in very specific situations, and magically he falls into that specific situation. He always gets the girl, no matter how ridiculous. He knows how to operate any vehicle, be it helicopter, jet, hovercraft, ATV, or backhoe, and do it with finesse. This new movie (and to a lesser extent Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace) tries to bring Bond down to earth, make him more believable, more human. Unfortunately, this new Bond feels neutered. When the old Bond would have received imaginative gadgets, this new Bond is told that gadgets are old-hat. He's then given a simple Walther PPK (coded to his hand print) and radio transmitter as his only \\"gadgets\\", then proceeds to lose his PPK 10 minutes later without ever firing it once. Throughout the film, Bond and M are referred to as \\"relics\\", performing a job that was outdated decades ago, and they themselves are viewed as too old to continue doing their jobs. Frequently the movie reminds us of what Bond used to be by being self-referential, but then lets us down by reminding us that this Bond is too serious for the fun antics of old Bond. Bond is injured and his performance suffers considerably as a result, making him feel weak, but only when it's convenient to the plot. Before the credits sequence, Bond is seemingly killed, but after the credits Bond is alive and ready for duty, without any explanation as to how he came back from the dead. The main villain (who doesn't show up until halfway through the film) is captured, but then escapes minutes later off camera using a computer virus. The computer virus explains how he got out of his cell, but not how he managed to kill two armed guards with his bare hands (which is never shown or explained). The villain himself is just not that interesting, and his motivation is rather weak. And often characters make blatantly bad decisions, like when M tells Moneypenny to take the shot when Moneypenny says she doesn't have a clear shot, or when Bond lets an assassin kill his target even though he could have easily stopped him, or when Bond warns that M is in danger, but no one bothers to take her to a safe house. Some stuff just defies logic, like when Bond falls under a frozen lake in street clothes for a significant amount of time, only to pop up minutes later perfectly healthy instead of suffering from hypothermia. There is literally a scene where Bond can't fire a gun straight due to a shoulder injury, then a moment later he disarms and shoots 4 henchmen dead in as many seconds. While the overall story makes sense, the moment to moment details just baffle.<br /><br />Unfortunately I did not enjoy this gadgetless, neutered Bond. The plot wasn't very strong, the villain was not very threatening, and the movie seemed to relish reminding us that old Bond movies are silly, and this one is not. I did not find the movie very engaging, and found it hard to care about any of the characters or their motivations. While some moments are a visual feast, good visuals do not a good movie make.<br /><br />On a side note, I've seen some people question why the \\"stolen MI6 list\\" is forgotten halfway through the movie, citing this as a plot hole. My understanding is that Silva (the villain) possess the list, so when MI6 apprehends Silva, it's logical to assume they've also retrieved the list.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Again such an emotional story like Hopeless.  Will is such an amazing guy and the love that he and Layken shared was amazing.  So much trauma for such young people to deal with, but they dealt with these situations with maturity. This was such a great love story, can't wait to read Point of Retreat to see how their story continues.
B00BB67UNW|3.0|This film left me unfulfilled. Russell Crowe didn't sing, which is a plus. The characters were stiff and the dialouge stale. This is just another \\"me too\\" crime drama. Wait for the rental.[By Michael Ledo TOP 500 REVIEWER ]<br /><br />That is exactly how I felt. Also see IMDB (Rating: 6.1/10 - 6299 votes) and scroll to the bottom for another review which is pretty close in my humble opinion.<br />A DVD rental at best.
B009K6DKTS|5.0|Although not evenly dense in terms of information conveyance and not always logically consistent, it gives the reader a host of brand new thoughts and provokes to generate one's own ideas as well.

B005LAIHR2|3.0|If I were able I would probably give this film 3-1/2 stars, but as that's not possible I'll stick with a solid 3. Yes, it's cringeworthy in spots and yes, the hair and costuming is awful at times and yes, it's very cheesy and yes, it's still a damn good time all around. This is what satire is, guys. Face it, when you're making a movie that takes its cues from the music in it (and especially when that music is 80s hair metal), your plot is going to be EXTREMELY corny and pretty predictable. But when you're making a movie that takes its cues from 80s hair metal, it's obviously not all about the plot.<br /><br />The musical numbers in Rock of Ages are performed with so much heart and soul that it makes me think these actors belong on the Broadway stage -- they pour everything into their parts, and that's half of what makes it such great fun. I was extremely impressed with Tom Cruise's vocal work; never knew he could sing like that! And I was so glad to see Catherine Zeta-Jones in a musical again because she's a great all-around performer -- the female Hugh Jackman equivalent without the nasal singing voice. In fact, I really thought the whole cast did well when it came to singing, even Russell Brand and Alec Baldwin (I have a notorious hatred for anything Baldwin does, so this was particularly impressive to me). Their subplot felt a bit rushed, but they played off each other so well that it was hilarious to watch how things unfolded. Russell probably stole the show, if there was anything left to steal after Cruise came through. I'm one of those people who still thinks Tom Cruise is a psycho after the whole jumping-on-Oprah's-couch thing; it made me lose so much respect for him as a professional (not to mention that it seems like a lot of the roles he plays anymore are still reaching for the stars of his Mission Impossible days). But Stacee Jaxx seemed to fit him like a glove -- or perhaps those leather pants. For his age, he's in great shape. And who honestly knew he could sing at all, let alone WELL? Color me impressed. Grudgingly so, but impressed.<br /><br />The downfall in my eyes is the choreography. I don't go into movie musicals expecting a whole lot, but I do like to see solid choreography. The dance moves were so boring, and knowing that someone as renowned as Mia Michaels was the choreographer, I couldn't help but be disappointed there. I think it would've been better to not put so much emphasis on the structured style of choreography and keep it a bit more loose and flexible -- yes, this is based on a Broadway musical, where choreography runs rampant, but it's also an 80s homage. People should be able to just let loose and be wild.<br /><br />In the end, this is definitely on my list of guilty pleasure movies -- not sure if I'd watch it again or just pick up the soundtrack to keep in my car. If you've got a sense of humor and love 80s music, you'll get a kick out of this one.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Worth far more than 9.99.  One of those books that you have to read over several times to extract the vast amount of knowledge.

B008Y7N7JW|1.0|I love the movie, however, was extremely disappointed when the Blu Ray disc kept stopping...or lost audio, or when the video started to pixellate. Very very disappointed!
B008DVKTMW|4.0|This is a great record start to finish. The singer sounds a bit like post Floyd Syd Barrett when he was singing baritone mostly. Vocals are drenched in dense layers of trippy effects which I happen to love. The guitar bass and drums sound like Sonic Youth when they were at their best except the chord progressions lean more towards the \\"pop\\" side. The other odd thing about this album is that the best track is the last track. Get this album you will enjoy it.

006074748X|4.0|This took over 100 pages for anything to get going.  Meanwhile there were pages of descriptions of Vienna, the Austrian countryside, the circus, and of course the Lipizzan horses.  Learned a lot about them.  But, finally, when Lewis March does show up, things take off.  I liked him a lot and could easily see him in film, someone like Pierce Brosnan.  Scenic beauty galore.  The description of the old Lippizaner, Piebald, doing his routine from long past memory, in that lonely field, seen only by Vanessa, just an instinctual reaction to the music, almost brought tears to my eyes.  It was exquisitely written.  Great locations, this could make a good film.

B009IEXKXI|4.0|Fun, involving read -- a Robinson Crusoe-on-Mars kind of thing.  There isn't ANY character depth or development -- our main character is just this likable, exceptionally competent guy, dealing with what he's dealing with.  But he is likable and the story is really fun if you like a suspenseful yarn.  As to the scientific accuracy:  I am a humanist, so I'm not equipped to judge, but it sure SOUNDS plausible.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is one of my favorite novels. I have reread it several times. I would also recommend \\"ENDER'S SHADOW\\" if you enjoy this book.[[ASIN:0765342405 Ender's Shadow (Ender, Book 5)]]

B008J34466|5.0|I liked every song on this album. It's upbeat even when the topic being song about it heartbreaking. I normally don't like when singers have a bunch of duet or featured artist sing with them but each song seemed to fit both artist style and worked really well. There's usually one song I constantly will skip on an album but not this one. It's great!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so, so, so, so, so, AWESOME!!!!! I Love It I play it one PC And XBOX 360
B007V4QLY2|5.0|What can I say. I love P!nk on and off the stage. I love the messages (good and bad) to sends to girls in her music.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|When I'm bored this is the game I go to when I'm bored. This game is so fun. Cant wait for the next new addition.
1452110581|5.0|Love the tone and the anecdotes. A fun read wherein I found each of my many cats from over the years.  Especially the one who &#34;peed&#34; on everything... sigh
B001GF8WPI|2.0|This is a very good movie, a different kind of role for Will Ferrell, but the description posted by amazon stated that this blu-ray had spanish subtitles, however, it doesn't.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Yet again another terrific novel by Connelly.  Harry the detective, single father, trying to find adequate time  for his teenage daughter.  Working a 20 year old cold case...struggling with a new dept manager...amazing how Connelly managed to weave the plot so magically to an incredible conclusion. Recommended to any one who like a fast-paced realistic novel.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I love this app.  I do a lot of the match 3 apps and this one is great, because in addition to finding the matches you are also growing thr Trr os Life and helping to build it back up to its former glory.  I love when you are working toward a goal, unlike Bejeweled where you are just constantly finding matches with no payoff.  I haven't finished the game yet, but I am really close and I just can't put it down!  Great job with this one.
B00993I6D2|2.0|This is very slow moving, drab and boring. I read the book in high school which I found much better than this movie
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have NEVER stayed up till 2am reading before and I read a lot!  Excellent book, characters, insight and story!  When's the movie coming out?
0307949508|5.0|I am a latecomer to this series; I'd read initially that it was very violent (which is true) and misogynistic (which is emphatically NOT true).<br /><br />I think I liked this one even better than #1. The plot was less \\"clever\\", which threw the focus more on the characters and the writing. It was nicely convoluted, to be sure! just not as intricate a puzzle.<br /><br />I do think the expose of the sexual trafficking of women was more an excuse to start the wheels in motion here than something integral to the plot; the plot would have worked very similarly with drug- or gun-running as the motivating force, and actual trafficked women don't even make a brief appearance.<br /><br />Still- it IS good that this, rather than the \\"more serious\\" issues of drugs and guns, is the motivator here; I hope it brings some attention to a very real and usually ignored problem.<br /><br />Anyway- stepping off my soapbox- it's an excellent mystery and kept me turning the pages. I am very much looking forward to #3, and wish the series had been able to continue.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Controversies aside, this was an outstanding film covering a topic that was all over the headlines and is deeply rooted in the current affairs of our modern history. Bigelow has outdone herself in this genre and I found this movie a far more compelling work than &#34;Hurt Locker&#34;, which left me a little bit wanting.
1846556007|4.0|I have read all of Jo Nesbo's books.  This one was a little weak in comparison.  My fav was The Devil's Star.
B00402FGDK|5.0|Everything Glee purchased for gifts is great for all ages.  The music is great for any age and movies are fun too. Look at followers if you need proof how popular.
B005DESVPO|4.0|This extended single showcases Clarks' potential with some cracking guitar and vocals. Catchy riffs and music with a groove. I was very exited at the prospect of his debut full album having heard this short set. The Album was an anticlimax. It could have been great if it matched the performances captured here.
B00AB7HESI|2.0|Scribblenauts Remix requires \\"run at startup\\" device access to install. Why is this necessary? I'd rather not have games starting as my device boots and consuming battery without my knowledge.
B0041EVYVK|5.0|I've been a fan of Daniel Lanois for a lot of years now so eagerly grabbed a copy of this on release. It features his usual session musician suspects Brian Blade Drums, Daryl Johnson Bass plus Trixie Whitley vocals. Whitley has a great voice and makes the tracks she sings on very memorable. The tracks are have that unmistakeable Lanois atmospheric guitars and signature rhythm patterns. I would love to see them live,
B008B92U32|3.0|It is an interesting concept!!  It can be fun to swap faces.  Fun way to mess with your friends and family!!
B000ULQV0W|5.0|A record that you can listen to over and over and appreciate just as much, if not more, with each listen.<br /><br />Stunning.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Not one of my favorite games but it is an enjoyable game.  This is a good game for killing time.
B004RUF9DC|5.0|I always watched this movie growing up, this blue ray transfer is excellent, the wide screen version is better than that pan and scan VHS I had in the 80's it's like watching a new movie all over again.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|The story was fantastic, the writing concise, and the humor extremely dry... what a combination! I often found myself laughing out loud at Allan Karlsson's adventures, past and current. The crazy cast of historical and fictional characters reminded me of a combination of Forrest Gump and something out of a Tim Dorsey novel.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This is the best franchise ever.  That is, for creative people.  Scribblenauts is a very, very fun game.  I love every game, and this is no exception.  I suggest this app to every one.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|We hope Matt Damon makes another Bourne movie someday, & these ones he already did are showing us how Jason Bourne is a U.S. hero who got backed into a bad corner by his employer/superiors but was able to advance out of those traps.
B000MCH5P4|2.0|I saw this film with two other people: one liked it very much, one sort of liked it, and I didn't like it at all. So if nothing else, it's a good movie for discussion. As for my own opnion, it was obivous to me after the first twenty minutes or so that we were dealing with \\"six degrees of separation.\\" While the film is well acted, it goes nowhere after establishing this. The abandonment of a linear chronology for the narrative, which seems to be Inarritu's trademark (see Amores Perros and 21 Grams), is just gimmicky, with no real purpose in the film. And while it may be the most moving part of the film, the Mexico segment is completely extraneous. Yes, it involves the children of the American couple, but so what?
0307716988|5.0|Loved the book  very informative  Because he wrote it was his perspective and his thoughts  Loved it very much would get a book from here again
1615234195|5.0|As usual, Mitch Albom crafts a great message in an insightful manner.  It is fortunate for us that Mitch uses the \\"bully pulpit\\" that he enjoys as a popular sports writer to remind us of what is truly most important.  Interesting twists, parallels and \\"coincidences.\\" A gifted author.
B008I74JLS|5.0|wasn't sure if I would like it but loved it, loved the fact it was blu ray and played on my player.<br />great story and very funny
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|Where are the power ups? Works great on my kindle but you can't buy power ups. My husband has it on his iPad and can get power ups. Can't do it on my kindle. Please fix!
B0080K3RGQ|5.0|A bit hard to get some of the food stuffs here in Australia, but my husband has been trialing some of there on the family and OMG, WOW.  Yummmm...
1419702203|5.0|All those little licks, all those riffs, all those lead breaks and all the searching for that special different sound ... vale George! You were my musical soul mate and a great ont to emulate.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This is truly a life changing movie. Absolutely amazing. Great actors and the songs will stick in your head forever.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Here we find the same qualities that made Before Sunrise a masterpiece: the acting, the chemistry between the stars, the glorious scenery, and the quick but authentic dialogue, much of which feels improvised (but was actually written collectively by Hawke, Delpy, and the director). But what makes it more compelling is the fact that the story takes place in a world many of us are more familiar with, when youthful idealism has faded and the droll of life has begun. This film does an amazing job of injecting honesty and the potential for fulfillment and love back into these almost middle-aged lives. Just wonderful.
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|Disclaimer:  The following is my opinion.  It is not to be taken as absolute fact.  It is only my thoughts and feelings, nothing more.  Yours may be different and that's fine.  Now, on to the review...<br /><br />I adore Josh and I hate that I can only give this album three stars, but when it's compared to the likes of Closer and Awake, there's just no way I can give it more.  None of the album is BAD.  Just forgettable.  There are a couple of high points (\\"Sincera\\" being one), but after listening through a couple of times, I can't say that I really want to listen again.  I remember the first time I heard \\"Oceano\\" from the Closer album - it actually brought me to tears, as did \\"Awake\\" from the Awake album.  None of these songs sparked any emotion - I didn't feel them like I've felt some of his past work.<br /><br />On the plus side, I DID enjoy this album a lot more than Illuminations, which only produced one memorable song for me - \\"Voce Existe Em Mim.\\"  However, I'm still a bit disappointed with this.  I understand branching out and adapting and trying new things, but it would be nice if there was still a bit of the old in the mix.<br /><br />I will, of course, continue listening to Josh and supporting him.  I think he has an exceptional talent, he works hard and he's very appreciative of his fans and does a lot of charity work.  It's too bad there aren't more out there like him.  I'm just waiting for another album that I can give five stars.
B001NA6096|5.0|I have seen this film many times and am struck not only by the acting, the chemistry between the stars, the glorious scenery, but most importantly, the fact that it transports us all to idealistic youth, when romance and true love could be found a Eurostar train. I also love the fact that much of the dialogue was improvised, and that makes the intensity and depth of the conversation even that much more amazing.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Great app overall. Helps get me to sleep blocking outside noises-husband snoring, dog rolling, or my stressful mind set that often keeps me awake.<br /> I do like the 40+ offers of sounds that are able to loop as I sleep or read. The led clock is great as I like to always know the time at night . The brightness can be adjusted-another great feature. The use of alarms if needed is good but I usually am always up before daylight anyway.<br />I do recommend buying the app as the free version does not allow one to read at the same time.<br />My reason for not giving this app five stars is the annoying fact that I h<br />Have to FORCE it to stop. There is no simple way to turn it off when done. Whenever you move into another app or video it keeps going until I go back two or three times to turn it off. The app co. needs to adjust this but I still advocate getting this soothing app.(Although I do not understand why anyone finds a vacuum cleaner calming)!
B00008G8M4|5.0|One of the very best alien sci-fi movies ever made.  And having it on DVD I can now watch it whenever I want to.  I especially like the version that adds some scenes that were left out from the original movie, which I always feel help to explain things that are happening in the movie.  I absolutely love having the DVD of this movie!!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|A little below my age level (I'm 64) but enjoyable.  I would recommend this to relatively mature teens or young adults.
B0030V0PEW|5.0|I enjoy Dr Gawande's book generally and this was no exception.  Easy to reach, easy to digest, and much to think about in terms of the limitations we put on ourselves to truly bring about health care change.
0394818237|5.0|This is really engaging and has lots of vocabulary building opportunities. Each time we read it we find new things. I am very happy with the purchase.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|This perhaps not one of his top novels, but it is typical McEwan--perceptive, imaginative, and very well written.<br />SC Smith
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway serfers so munch one day I was on it for 24 hours I love it I love It I love it some much go subway serfers
B00338QENI|5.0|As a Scientist that uses HeLa cells quite often, I found this book very thought provoking and significant. This is a great read!
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I saw this in the theaters. When I saw that they Amazon were allowing Prime members to watch it for free, I allowed my cousin's kids to watch it. Even they thought the movie was overhyped. I understand the books were best sellers, but a &#34;Lottery&#34;-like movie and basically a PG-fied Battle Royale, viewers watched this like it was 2012's greatest unique movie. Seeing it again for the second time here on Amazon just reaffirmed to me that this movie just wasn't great.
1401223176|5.0|Great mystery story that will have you second guessing the outcome all the way through.  I love how Jeph and Jim run the gambit of the major DC villains and heroes and squaring Batman off against Superman of Poison Ivy was a great moment.  Jim Lee is arguably the best graphic novel artist working in the medium today (and possibly ever).  As I was reading the story I thought I had it figured out but then Loeb throws you a curve ball placing you back to square one.  Also the interactions between Batman and Catwoman are classic and one of the lines in this novel is actually used in the Christopher Nolan film The Dark Knight Rises.  If you love Batman stories like I do than this graphic novel is a must for your Batman collection.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I originally opted from seeing this in the theaters with regret. Seeing this in the big screen would have been great with all the animation this movie offered. The story and content were very kid friendly.
B008P9M614|5.0|We loved watching \\"House\\" before it ended its run on TV.  Now we have every episode of every season in one box, not to mention the nifty little book that came with it.  It was a steal the day I ordered -- under $90, including shipping.  I can only imagine how much money and time I saved by buying this box set instead of going to the stores and looking for each of the eight seasons (well, we already had the first two seasons on DVD).  If you or someone you know is a \\"House\\" fan, this deal can't be beat.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I read the first four books at rapid speed as I was enthralled by the story. The writing is very good and satisfying to those who like well constructed prose. Then I began &#34;Dance&#34; and started to get annoyed. The story  does not move forward. It gets stuck and becomes disjointed as Martin jumps from one character scenario to another. I felt as if the author was not sure where he wanted to take the story and got lost in giving us deeper details about the characters. Also I got personally angry about his killing off all my favorite characters, especially Jon Snow. And leaving Araya at loose ends not to mention what was up with her mother. This book seemed to me to be a stop gap for the author, as if he is treading water while he figures out how to bring the saga back to life. But who can wait so long for Martin to get it together. I for one am moving on.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I like having books separate, but considering this is cheaper than buying the second book by itself (or it was at the time I purchased this set) it's definitely worth getting.
B0053JJLLC|4.0|I liked it and thought that Preston did a good job of keeping Crichton's style in completing the book.  Unfortunately, I thought that the ending was weak.  Still, I found it entertaining and thought provoking of what the environment and conditions would be to be &#34;micro&#34;.
B00340LM8C|1.0|Slow movie, bad acting, badly put together, start with a random scene where lead character is afraid that he is being suspected as a jewel robber just because he did some robbery long time ago, very childish.
B000060OFT|4.0|it was a good movie but the original was better.<br />it was a good movie but the original was better.<br />it was a good movie but the original was better.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|As always Nicholas Sparks weaves a tale of love that is a page turner.  Great book.  I am glad I read it.
B00C1BUYX4|2.0|not bad but I thought it would be better, this was a story of Abe yes but just about the 13th amendment only then he got shot so not really a lot of life story itself like walk the line or other history bio&#34;s so anyway I wouldn't waste your time on this one
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Great collection.  I am a big fan of &#34;greatest hits&#34; collections and this one does the trick.  It has them all.
B00BYOEZTI|2.0|if you liked the first lord of the rings then you would like this one because its a duplicate of it.......I would wait for all three to come out because since they made three out of 1 book it definitely shows that....
B008393Q2O|1.0|When the password ask you to enter... but don't typing anything,  just go back button and it's will break in..<br /><br />I stick to Android 4.0.4 stock Memo apps is much better
B00BSBY38A|2.0|ok so I watch it and was excited until all this boring dialog that didn't mean anything and then it went into him on a boat very boring and meaningless
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|This is an awesome game . I love killing zombies. Here is my minimum words for the review of the game. Like it
B00BETX5PS|2.0|this bond was long and boring the whole time. I wish it had at least some of the bond gadgets. I would not recommend this movie
B00942S4OY|5.0|Similar sound as their other CD but that's what makes it good. They stick to the catchy tunes with a few ballads. It's just a cool CD to add to your collection.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Good book!!! Good storyline, I like reading books like this! It's a must read. Wouldn't be my type of guy tho
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|I feel like such a fan girl listening to their music but I love it. It has a catchy beat and fun lyrics. I want to be 13 dancing on the bed in my pjs again...
B000H9I0ZQ|5.0|If you're a Steve Hackett fan, buy this. Howl is my favorite Hackett solo song of all time. There is a bit of &#34;Siesta Jazz&#34; but all in all a winner.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Couldn't stop watching this series. It was so interesting and entertaining the time flew by in seconds.I would recommend this series to anyone.
B009TZBEKW|5.0|Great for running, dancing, listening.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album if you like dance music!<br /><br />Favorite song is - Sweet Nothing.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm a pinaholic. The app works great. It allows me to take pinterest into the kitchen, craft room, and outside. So convenient, I have it on my phone and tablet.
B004U52VPS|5.0|My kids loved this game. It was a fun game that I even enjoyed playing with them. It was nice to have them play something that did not involve electronics.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|All the different layouts make this a game that is constantly challenging and entertaining.  All in all, you couldn't ask for more!
B005LLSNNE|2.0|The motorcycle group is made up of such stupid people and the absurdity that a women who went to medical school could be so stupid to fall for one of the motorcycle idiots is unbelievable. I just stopped caring about these people, I could not relate to them
B006FE83UE|5.0|This is one of my wife's faverate movies so I got it for our 22nd annaversary. My wife and girls watched it together and they all just loved it. That is the greatest thing going on. thanks
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I think this is a fun game and might be kind of sad if it went away.First, there are no glitches in this game and runs very smoothly on the kindle fire.<br />I used to play this game whenever I had the free time but I don't play it as much anymore. Since the new game Subway Surfers came out I have beenon it a lot more, because of the extra features as in daily challenge and hoverboards.<br />If you are debating between this or subway surfers then I would recommend Subway Surfers. The only things is that with Subway Surfers the daily challenge needs internet to reappear but Temple Run 1 & 2 do not.
B00466HN6S|5.0|I thought this would be great for my girls but whole family enjoyed it thanks will watch again with my girls
B006LSZECO|5.0|Well-crafted characters that fore the reader to question every event while relishing in every page. The Dunnes are an unforgettable, &#34;Amazing&#34; couple!
B000002KHF|5.0|Van the man What more can I say great music, great memories, great kick back times, I just love this one
B008VBYN80|3.0|This game feels more as if I am playing the slot machines, getting the chance to battle and earn coins/money comes every 9 out of 10 pulls... in other words slow pace and time consuming.
B00000K2W1|5.0|My wife got this for a trip she took with the girls she turned my girls into Janis Joplin nuts
B007SOQBCM|3.0|This is a great concept considering some Linux/android systems can not run flash player, but the biggest issue is the lack of support, half the time the stream will not load, or it will be at super low quality.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love the series! The picture is awesome on my kindle fire HD. I can't put it down! No worries about missing the network show.
125000568X|5.0|What a treat this book is!  I kept putting it off because as a loyal Queen fan for 30 years I didn't think I needed another book.  WRONG!  Turns out my Queen library wasn't complete without it!  What a special tribute this is to both the band and the fans.  I was pleasantly surprised at all the new things in this book.  I have just about every book published and was so knocked out by this one that I think it's got to be my fave now!  There was obviously a lot of thought and love that went into this and this Queen fan is very appreciative!
1892005034|5.0|practical help with getting along with others<br />if everyone would take this seriously wars would end<br />the copy I got was in good shape
B002436WFI|5.0|I Love to read Pratchett books:  I can laugh at myself and other people. He makes fun of everyone and everything --- nothing is sacred. The only difference is that he uses is other being instead of minorities, ethinics, religions, etc. He uses trolls, dwarves, witches, etc.  The movies make you laugh out loud. I hope they (Pratchett and  BBC) continue making movies from his books.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is a great game to play it can use a little more stuff tho. Like more free lives an gold bricks..
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|If you are interested in the Civil War or Lincoln's life, it's a good film. If you're looking for action, probably not a good choice.
B005LAII0I|3.0|i like the movie because i loved the fairytale snow white. and this movie is much better than snow white and the huntmam
B004SIP7AS|5.0|I really liked the casting of this film. Everyone was spot on , and made the story even more enjoyable.
B005HSL626|4.0|Love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Fruit Ninja is so fun. You can earn backgrounds in sensei swag. You can also get new best score 's. YOU HAVE TO GET IT. There's lot of stuff to do. Finally you have a zero chance of getting cut when you slice fruit!!!!!
B00005S6K8|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who loves the story of Sabrina. The older adaptations were well done also, but like this one the best. It's a great story, well told.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is so awesome! There are caves, ropes, and one giant monkey, so get it if you haven't!!!!!!!!!
B000LTAY1U|5.0|looks great - i love the green canvas material in our warm florida - and it tells theright time :-)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers! It is so fun. Also if you update it you can join the subway suffers tour. You can go to places like Austrailia, New York, and so many more. So get it and keep it up to date.
B000P2A256|5.0|This is by far my favorite Maroon 5 album ( I have 4 others).Keep it in my car and listen to it over and over again. Ordered from Amazon, which I do for almost all my music, and cd arrived quickly as promised. Love it!
0316228532|3.0|Ever read a Russian novel, where there are seemingly hundreds of characters and it is impossible to keep track of the relationships among them without creating a family tree or flow chart?  This is that book, but in English.  I had to consult my chart regularly, until I hit page 250.  At that point, I finally grasped who was who and I was able to ditch the chart.  And, that is the major problem with this book -- WAY WAY WAY too many characters fighting one another, secretly in love with one another, sabotaging one another, etc. etc.  Having said this, the book is a really good, sometimes snarky, expose on class in England.  There are surprises and secrets sprinkled throughout the book, and I liked the plot development, but keeping track of everyone was really tough!!  But for the character confusion, I'd rate the book a solid 4 stars.  Oh, and I have not read the Potter books, so my review is based only on what I read, not on what what I wished the book had been or based on differences between this book and the HP series.
B00AUA67GQ|5.0|I love it but have to remember to write slower. Sometimes I can't read my own writting! I use it to take notes in workshops and jot down story ideas for my novels.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|This CD has more variety than previous efforts, which was actually quite necessary. Still rocks just as hard as ever, just includes a wider selection of styles across the 14 songs.<br /><br />After the first four awesome records in their catalogue, repetition was beginning to creep in, particular at the back end of their CDs.<br /><br />This starts a little slowly for the band, but, rocks harder and harder as it gains momentum after the first two songs.<br /><br />Great effort, especially considering the personnel differences. You can only tell that there is some new lead guitar work going on that wasn't there previously.<br /><br />This should be a breakout year for the band, Volbeat 2013!
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|I did chuckle a couple of times and awed a little. I like all the actors as well but the talking, cursing, emotional lebile bear I didn't really care for.
B001AQR3IU|5.0|I won't get into the details of the story; that's already available in the editorial reviews and many of the customer reviews.  So I'll just add our star rating to all the other reviewers and say that this is simply a wonderful story, well-acted by some marvelous and exceptional actors.  (And anything by Neil Gaiman is a favorite because he always captures something special in anything he does.)
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|My wife and I found this movie entertaining, we both enjoyed it. Good plot lots of action and the ending left it open to a possible sequel.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Addictive &amp; totally fun!!! Great game for all, even if it weren't free. No hangups or bugs that I've encountered. Highly recommend!!!
141694737X|5.0|This is a sweet and charming book.  I bought it because many years ago, I read &#34;It's Mine&#34; by Rod Campbell, and it was one of our favorite books.  Look for that one too!!
B004VMUS9G|2.0|I have the free version of this app.  The ads are located right below the dismiss button.  When I try to quietly turn off the alarm so as to not wake my spouse, I seem to always hit the ad which sends me to a different screen and makes it take longer to shut off.  Perhaps the paid version is better.  I am going to try another free one first.
0060920084|1.0|I could not get through this book. What I think is supposed to be humor comes across as mean, nasty remarks about anyone who doesn't think or look just like Bill Bryson. Also, when I read the part about Philadelphia, which is where I'm from, he led me to wonder how accurate any of the book was because a lot of the things presented as facts about that area were just plain wrong. For instance, he says the houses are brownstone, which is what the buildings in New York are, not Philadelphia. There were several other points that were inaccurate, too. I've enjoyed other books by Bill Bryson, but this one was a big let-down.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|ColorNote is a nice simple program. Easy to use and great for organizing misc information. Custom configuration is pretty nice.
B006JPS1OM|1.0|Don't waste your money!  Got to chapter 7 and it kicked us out  Started over and got kicked out at chapter 9  Was pretty fun till that.  This was on my kindle fire.
B002JI94J4|3.0|I have to admit after all these years I find this one the hardest of all of the Beatle Movies to watch.  Even over Let it Be (which is just wall to wall music for the most part).  After growing up and growing old with the Beatles A Hard Day's Night seems so artificial now. It sounds, reads and plays like someone trying to capture the Beatles and coming so close but just far enough off to make it sort of painfully obvious; John's the sarcastic one, Paul's the cute one, and George is young and - I dunno.  Ringo is of course the odd man out looking for himself.  In 1964, before we really knew them, it was great fun. In 2013 it's kinda depressing.  Though Help gets knocked as a movie that just happens to have the Beatles in it, watch it again. They may be just props but they come across as having a lot of fun, muttering add libs and clearly being silly within the context of another person's concept.  I think it's more fun to watch while trying to catch all the little quips John tosses out randomly. They are obviously in the middle of their Tea Drinking years and really enjoying themselves and each other's company. It's almost like there are two movies going on in Help: the one Richard Lester Directed and the one The Beatles are running around having fun in.  Final note. Paul's commentary on Magical Mystery Tour Rerelease is GREAT! I wish he and Ringo would go back and do the same for AHDN, Help and Let it Be.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I can hardly believe it.  Riordon has done it again.  This blends humor, drama, and adventure all in one book.  The prophecy of seven has started and Annabeth must follow the Mark of Athena to find the Athena Parthenos.  You will not regret reading this book for all ages.
B002RKSZWG|5.0|I've read this well over a dozen times and will read it a dozen more. Beautiful story and wonderful characters.
B008393Q2O|3.0|For those with the Samsung Galaxy S Note 10.1, \\"Skinny Note Notepad Notes\\" is extremely basic with much less capabilities. I couldn't find any copy and pastIng of pictures allowed. Or mixing of text and handwriting allowed on the same note.<br /><br />That being said, for anyone not spoiled with a Note 10.1, this is an easy to utilize app. You can make normal notes and notes that you write using your own handwriting, and lastly, list making capabilities. Anyone should be able to understand this app, and how to use it properly.<br /><br />The star rating is based on other similar apps -not including the Note 10.1.
B007LYB4BC|2.0|To be honest, I really enjoy the vibe and timbre of this album. I listened first as an MP3, then bought it on vinyl with great expectations - the art work is very retro and cool, and I understand that it was recorded in mono, which is cool also as it celebrates the period as intended. My problem is that the engineering / mixing just plain sucks, on vinyl the energy and overall tonal quality of this album falls seriously short.<br />Therfore, I cannot recommend it in this format - I would recommend the album / artist as a whole, just not on this medium.

B005LAIIHG|5.0|Just as the mathematical expression is at once a rational number expressed by the fraction 22/7, so it is also an irrational number that can be expanded to an infinate number of characters. There are the logical questions. Does the character, Pi, survive days on end in an open boat in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with a raging tiger sharing the boat with this boy ?  Is this not also the story of a young person learning to control the wildness in himself while trying to survive the relentless storms which life throws at him ?<br /><br />I will never know the answers.
B00BQEFM6Q|5.0|Phildel is a stunning new artist from the UK who writes music that can be described as a cross between Imogen Heap, Kate Bush and Enya.  Not only is she a consumate piano player, but she possesses a beautiful and emotive voice. The songs from \\"Disappearance\\" display a neo-victorian aesthetic that is beautiful, intimate and melancholic.  This is an artist who sounds as if she's been releasing music for ages. It is a stunning debut that will appeal to almost everyone.
B001DJLD1M|2.0|Renewed review: I originally gave this five stars (see \\"Original description\\" below). It was a steal for 4 movies. In certain parts of the movie, it freezes, which basically makes them unwatchable. Save your money and buy them individually<br /><br />Original description: \\"For the price:movie ratio, this was a steal. The Matrix (first movie) itself is worth the price of the total paid. The package came in four disks (in one movie case), although the back of the case says it is two discs (double sided), so this is definitively a plus.<br /><br />Overall : Worth it!\\"

These have always lead to scratches on discs for me. Mostly I got the product for the sake of its price. Four movies (three of them I like to watch) for twenty bucks and on blue-ray is a good deal.

B0060MYM7O|4.0|I had already seen game of thrones on HBO so I knew I loved the series and needed it on blue-ray, but with my first set I received damaged disks. The digital copies were dirty and had tons of scratches on them. I called amazon and their customer service was amazing as always and I had a new set sent to me. When I got the second set the packaging on the inside where the discs are held had been damaged from prior folding. I did not try and get a new set but I am disappointed I received what looked to be unopened packages that were damaged both times.
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|We decided to pick this movie up last night without knowing anything about it other than reading a few Amazon reviews.  We did it right - watched it at night with the lights out and with a good sound system - And were all VERY surprised how disturbing and truly suspenseful this movie was.  I would NOT recommend this movie for anyone under 14 or maybe even 16 even though there is NO nudity and only a little language --- The disturbing imagery and terror could keep you up at night!<br /><br />I've really seen them ALL when it comes to Horror movies and there was only one movie that I truly felt \\"disturbed\\" while watching it and after it was over - THE EXORCIST.  But, believe it or not, I believe I can now place this one next to it!<br /><br />Yes, like another reviewer, I was annoyed that Ethan Hawke would NEVER turn the lights on like a normal person would, but the story, disturbing imagery, sound effects and great acting MORE than made up for that problem.<br /><br />Repeated views will tell if this one can stand up to the classic EXORCIST.  But, for now, all I can do is highly recommend this movie to any real Horror/Suspense fan!
B007KL8Z40|3.0|I'll admit up front I apparently didn't listen to the other tracks before ordering this; I bought a few CDs at the same time and though I had. I'd heard 'Do You Remember' and it's a great song. The rest that I listened to are nothing like it (I got to track 8 before changing the disc) and are very mellow. There's nothing WRONG with them, but it's not the kind of music I like. So definitely check it out with the previews. I'll probably give this to my sister.

B005LAIHZY|2.0|I've never written a review on amazon before, but after watching Brave for the first time only a few days ago, I really feel like I should speak out my opinion.<br /><br /> ( CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THOSE WHO HAVENT SEEN THE MOVIE DONT READ )<br /><br /> The first time I saw the trailer for Brave I thought OH WOW THIS ACTUALLY LOOKS GOOD lol! Most family movies that come out these days just seem to be more for the little kids then the entire family.(I grew up on the movies from renaissance Disney) So when I found out about Merida, The fresh new warrior princess defying tradition.. I guess I over hyped it for myself.<br /> The beginning looked great! Everything looked so real I thought I was watching live action. The music is very beautiful and melodic. Our female protagonist is princess Merida. A flame haired tomboy who is a skilled archer  and loves riding her horse Angus. She spends most of her time at home fussing with her mother the queen Elinors strict commands on how to be a proper princess. I didn't have a problem with this, Elinor is just trying to be a good mother and teach her daughter how to do things the right way for her own good and wellbeing. Of course Merida isn't ok with these rules of being a princess. So Merida and Elinor spend most of there time arguing with each other.<br /><br />  This all really doesn't bother me because when I was going through my earlier years of puberty I was a bit of a brat too. But since then ive been having the best relationship with my mom. Mostly because she never gave in to my tantrums and stood her ground. Something sadly most parents don't do and just give in. Creating spoiled adult brats the rest of society have to deal with. I don't like to say best friends with my mom because im only 17 and shes in her 50s, but I do talk to my mom about EVERYTHING. She is the first person I go to for advice about anything. My mom is like my queen and Im her princess, shes the loving mentor I could ever want and NEED.<br /><br />  But this isn't the case through Meridas eyes. Elinor informs her that she is to be betrothed to one of her father's allied clans sons. Merida doesn't like this idea of getting married to anybody and at her young age. So she throws the biggest fits from here on out. (Through out the rest of the whole film.) If I was going to be put through arranged marriage at my age, I would have a fit too. But Merida is a princess of the 10th century Scotland world. Her marriage is only for the sake of peace for her country. She could still shoot her arrows after shes married.. or maybe not. Things get even more sour when Merida yells off at her mom screaming '' I would rather die then be like you!'' and runs away for an hour. Everything is easily fixed with magic, so she goes to a witch to try and change her fate. Well this is were I get a little confused and even sick to the stomach. She basically asks the witch for a spell to CHANGE HER MOM. I thought '' woahhh what now?'' is this suppose to be the bravery we are about to see? So instead of just maybe wishing for a different fate, she specifically asks that her mother be changed. Not even Ariel from the little mermaid asked that lol.( She had the bravery to actually switch out her tailfin not change her dads opinions of the forbidden human world.) Am I really the ONLY daughter in the whole wide world who got sick at this? Merida gives her mom a CURSED CAKE and watches her mom get SICK, and all Merida says is ' YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND YET MOMMY''?! Elinor gets ill and sick from the cursed cake while her heartless daughter practically gets high hopes off of this. Elinor then turns into a bear and the rest of the movie is about how cool Merida is trying to own up to her lil mistake. And everybody is ok with that. Merida doesn't really do or change or mature into anyone. Its mostly her mother that does the changing. Well she changes her opinion on her daughter getting married and lets her off the leash. Which would have been nice... ifshe wasn't practically cursed in the process to learn her lesson on how to be a better mom. Merida and Elinor grow a closer bond with each other while Elinor being a bear and all, Merida even teaches her mom how to catch fish. The ending of the movie is just '' you gotta be brave enough to change your fate-destiny-mom' or something like that. At least Mulan was able to find a way to honor her family and find her true self. Pocahontas chose her people over running off with John smith. Merida... continues riding her horse and now has a great relationship with her mom. They even make a new tapestry together with Elinor being the bear...(couldnt be her in human form)<br /><br />  It would have been slightly better if the movie explained how being a housewife isn't the most horrible thing that can happen to a woman, but that not all girls should be that way either.  And that whenever we have a problem with our mothers we should fix our moms. That doesn't come off as an independent brave princess to me. Sure Ariel runs away from home to go on land, but at least she didn't complain as much and just did what she wanted to do.<br /><br />  I grew up watching all the princess movies. Not just the fighter princess ones like Mulan and Pocahontas but also The little Mermaid , Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and all the rest. I love and adore all kinds of girls and women. From the lovesick girly girl Princesses, to the fighter princesses taking action into her own hands.<br /><br /> Today at 17 I don't feel the great need to get married to soon before the age of 25, and I don't need rescuing either. My mother is my hero. This movie kind of sends off a wrong message that your mom is the one who needs to change if you have a problem with her. Yes a parent can learn new things from their children, but the way it was done in this film.. It just doesn't sit well with me at all. If you want your daughter to feel loved and independent.. why not show her movies that does good for all us girls. Like The Little Princess and The Secret Garden from Warner Bros. Forget about those? Sure there not mother daughter flicks. But they have tons of girl power :)<br /> Ive posted a similar review on IMBD - Alondra(TamzinSniper@yahoo.com)she wasn't practically cursed in the process to learn her lesson on how to be a better mom.

B0096CDG0O|3.0|Overall I really like this game, but the version available on Amazon (2.2.3) is not the same version available on Google Play (2.7.5).  And since that version has more features, I am dissapointed that my paid for App is not being upgraded so that I can use those.  I have reached out to the developers but haven't received a response as to why they aren't offerring the latest version here in over 3 weeks.  If I could get the latest version, and better support, I might rate this higher.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best game ever! I like how it is so similar to the ones on the xbox and pc. They just need to add more blocks and that would be it! LOVE THIS YOU NEED TO GET IT!!!!!
B008393Q2O|2.0|I like the basic design and look of this app but it crashed and lost the first checklist I made.  Also, there is some important functionality it lacks Such as:<br /> - allowing user to erase/undo individual lines in a drawn note.<br /> - Full screen mode.<br /> - Auto capitalization.<br /><br />I would have given it three stars but had to deduct one for crashing and losing my work.<br /><br />On the plus side I like the fact that it has built-in help.  I wish more apps bothered to include help screens.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show was by far the best I have watched in a long time. I think Angela Lange does a great job in the series. I cant wait for the next one to come out to see if they can top the first two seasons!
B007HACDLK|4.0|Could see some of it coming, but the story and characters had so much meat it kept you turning pages to see if your own supposed intrigues were correct.  No man is alone, especially in the world of terrorists and the world of espionage; so the story shows good interplay between characters, yet keeping the lone wolf character as central to the entire story.  Flynn's books are getting better and better.
B000JLSM00|5.0|We had this movie on DVD but with the wondeful outdoor scenes we couldn't wait to get this one in Blu Ray when we got our player.  We loved it.
0425252868|5.0|This is an amazing story and when you pick up the book, you will not be able to put it down. I am definitely going to read it again. It is a powerful story about two men who are doing their duty to their country but who do not want to be in the war. The bravery, loyalty, commitment and humility is awe inspiring.  I especially liked the ending. This book must be made into a movie. It has Stephen Spielberg written all over it. Just an incredible read

B009PU2KIQ|4.0|Gary Clark Jr. is a hometown guitarist from Austin, TX who might as well have been born singing the blues. His debut full-length, Blak and Blu, is a solid album that is polished, tight, and extraordinarily well produced. The songs &#34;When My Train Rolls In&#34;, &#34;Ain't Messin' Around&#34;, &#34;Numb&#34;, &#34;Third Stone From the Sun (Hendrix cover)&#34;, and &#34;Bright Lights&#34; are scorching. Even the throwback doowop song &#34;Come Home&#34; is a nice, lilting melody.<br /><br />The album was (somewhat fairly) critiqued for trying to do too much. There are two or three songs that lean toward hip-hop/soul pieces, which are themselves not bad songs, but they feel out of sync with the prevailing guitar-driven songs that otherwise dominate the set. But to knock the album for having an experimental feel to it is somewhat silly in this day and age: everyone has access to music of all genres all the time, and I think that the album reflects the day and age in which it has been put together.<br /><br />I will say this: the album pales in comparison to Gary Clark Jr's live performances. Once you've seen him play in person, it literally is over. There is no substitute.

0553801473|3.0|Hi, I'm an average American reader of fiction and fantasy, and I love(d) George Marton's A Song of Ice and Fire, but since the bandwagon is my most treasured form of personal conveyance that all changed after I agreed with some negative reviews that hilariously poked fun at the author's self-indulgent ideosyncracies, because I don't judge things, or even form my own opinions, on the merits of these ideas themselves, but more on who agrees with them and mainly, who gets the most laughs in pointing out the flaws in things...<br /><br />Ok sorry, I know that's no way to conduct an argument, but the more Amazon reviews I read, the more obvious it becomes that people prefer to base their opinions and reviews on how many laughs they can get pointing out the flaws of something, and the more people agree the more likely they are to use these flaws to demonize authors and creators and even try to retroactively change their opinions on the rest of the series. This book does not validate your arguments on the corruption of authors who gain popularity, nor does it prove once and for all that George Martin does not know what he wants to do with the story - in fact, he has already shared the broad endings for the characters with the producers of the amazing and hugely popular show, so clearly he had a sense of where this is going. It's very clear that many people are angry because after reading 'A Dance with Dragons', they do not, and quite frankly they (and I) are not the kinds of fans to be appeased with ponderous descriptions of how every character \\"breaks their fast\\" and left with MORE cliffhangers at the end of every novel rather than resolving those from the previous. It's not a strange or unheard of tactic for stalling a novel series, but its not classy or beloved either. And thus the borderline hatred I'm reading. (Why do all negative reviews have to be borderline hatred towards the author? I don't get it.)<br /><br />That said, A Dance with Dragons in no way undoes the work of the previous books in the series (besides some of what I saw as obvious character assassination for the main trio of characters - Daenarys, Jon Snow and Tyrion, all of whom are shown to make bad, almost out-of-character decisions that lead to a read that many interpret as \\"going nowhere.) The truth is that they all do quite a lot of things in this book, ITS JUST NOT WHAT YOU, THE READER, WANT THEM TO DO. Just like I'm sure none of you wanted the Red Wedding to resolve certain characters, but you still think A Storm of Swords was amazing. So what's the problem? Well, I stated it very simply already, but the biggest difficulty in digesting this rather large volume is DEFINITELY NOT that \\"nothing happens\\" - a lot happens, in fact - but very little is RESOLVED, including anything from the last book.  If you came into what was declared in the opening page to be the second half of stories told during the timeline of A Feast for Crows expecting the storylines from that novel to be resolved, you were deluding yourself, but many people expected just that, and were disappointed and angry that a novel billed as a companion to the previous in the series was written the same way. These two books are a fantasy travelogue through the world he created, designed to continue expanding your exposure to the various disparate cultures on two continents, while often using the POVs as a way to fill in the backstory of the world itself, rather than just the characters. In that way, it is mostly successful.  Is it incredibly satisfying? No, not always. It might have been if he had a proper editor or intended to resolve anything in this volume, but clearly this was a laborious world-building exercise, not a resolution to the plot. They could have easily pulled out a ton of medieval breakfast menus and recurrences of certain, highly annoying phrases (WORDS ARE WIND x20, JON SNOW KNOWS NOTHING, TYRION DOESNT KNOW WHERE WHORES GO, DAENY IS JUST A YOUNG GIRL AND KNOWS LITTLE OF THE WAYS OF WAR) and paid it back with another fifty pages at the end of the book, what we in the industry refer to as a climax, which is entirely missing. Everybody is angry because after 1000 pages of George Martin's self-indulgence, we are used to also getting a payoff to the story. 'A Dance with Dragons' is basically like ending 'A Game of Thrones' at the line \\"Bring me his head!\\" and saying \\"to be continued in probably 5 or 6 years\\"... It's not a bad book, but it is disappointing and dare I say we have come to expect more from Martin than cheap cliffhangers. This is not an episodic television show, it takes awhile to read 1000 pages of food, dress, and landscape descriptions, you owe it to your fans to pay off that good faith with something more than killing off newly invented tertiary characters and leaving all the main plot threads brought up just in this volume to be resolved in the next, let alone the many other over-arching plotlines which are only touched upon only briefly. This is not a bad book, but there is more to critique here than in previous volumes, so in our modern internet culture reviews became hateful rants. Its a shame. Not the best entry in the series, but neither is it a paradigm of modern storytelling nor the worst example of quantity over quality.

B00B0YL0E0|5.0|THEN<br /><br />I'll admit, I was a little late to the Pretty Maids party.<br /><br />The Danish heavy metal band formed in 1981 (I was 4) and I didn't become aware of them until around 1996. Even then, my initial introduction came about not through their music but through a want ad in the back of a Metal Edge magazine. The now defunct rag had a section in each issue where fans could trade tapes and memorabilia with other like-minded fans. I used to scan these listings periodically for the names of bands I hadn't heard yet. I'd warrant that 65% of the bands in my current collection came from those classified ads. By 1996, however, I had become familiar with most of the A, B, and C-level bands of the 80s and early 90s. I had almost given up even checking the classifieds at all. That was when I saw the two words that would haunt me forever: PRETTY MAIDS. I immediately assumed they were an LA-based glam group...one with minimal studio output. Still, being the  completest that I was (and still am), I filed the name away in my subconscious under the heading: MUST HEAR.<br /><br />Six months later, while digging through dusty boxes of used cassettes at the local CD warehouse, I came across Future World. I snatched it up immediately due in part to the collector in me but more so because of the fantastical futuristic landscape and regal logo emblazoned across the front cover. Simply put, it looked bad ass. I got it home, put it in, and turned it up. I was hooked.<br /><br />I don't need to go into the merits of Future World. If you're familiar with the Maids, you're already well versed in that seminal slab of melodic stadium metal. I will say this: It was the perfect record to solidify me as a fan. Future World sounded like nothing I had ever heard before from that era. Future World sounded futuristic.<br /><br />I needed more. The problem was, I wasn't even sure there was more. Remember, this was in the early days of the internet...and I lived in the United States. As faras I knew, this was the only record this amazing band had ever recorded. Four months later, I found Jump The Gun. Two months after that, I found Sin-Decade. My mind was blown.<br /><br />I just couldn't believe this band existed. Here were three albums of top notch hard rock released in an era dominated by the genre and yet, they were virtually unknown to the general population. How was this possible? As the years went on, and as I obsessively acquired every last studio album, EP, live set, and Best Of in their catalog, I came to the realization that there really was no explanation.<br /><br />With the release of their latest album, Motherland, the Maids have amassed a combined total of 13 studio albums, 6 EPs, 3 live albums, and 2 compilations. All of this over a career spanning 30 years. And yet, they are still very much a cult band. If Motherland proves anything, however, it's that the Maids are still hungry for more...<br /><br />NOW<br /><br />Motherland is the highly anticipated followup to 2010's critically and commercially successful comeback album Pandemonium. Pandemonium was a great record...but I don't consider it the unabashed classic that some do. True, it was the freshest and most vital the band had sounded since the early 90s but it also had its share of filler as well. Beautiful Madness and Breathless always struck me as leftovers...possibly from the previous release Wake Up To The Real World. Also, I felt the inclusion of a remixed version of It Comes At Night was unnecessary and damaged the flow of the album.<br /><br />It's always difficult to follow a successful record. I remember reading interviews with the band where this was addressed over the last couple years. Well, they don't need to worry. Motherland surpasses Pandemonium easily.<br /><br />The production is absolutely stellar. It stomps all over Pandemonium from a height of 10 miles. It makes Wake Up To The Real World sound like a collection of demos. I'm not exaggerating. Go listen to that album and then chase it with Motherland. They sound 20 years apart. Jacob Hansen (Volbeat) has given the band a sound that not only reinvigorates them but also incorporates the soundscapes of the past. This is Pretty Maids circa 1987, shoved into a time machine, and dropped off in 2013. It is modern and classic at the same time. Jacob Hansen might be the Maids' very own Mutt Lange.<br /><br />Another huge part of this new sound is Morten Sandager (ex-Mercenary) whose keyboard work is epic and moving but non-intrusive. His work here is ambient and chilling in places and warm and connecting in others. Above all, it is modern and gives all these songs an heir of respectability and power. It's been a while since the Maids had an official keyboard player in the band...Morten was a fabulous choice.<br /><br />What can be said about Ronnie Atkins and Ken Hammer? One of the best writing teams in the genre. Atkins' voice just gets better as the years go by. Menacing and vicious one minute, melodic and soothing the next...he's truly a marvel and I suspect an inspiration to many melodic death vocalists today. Motherland is his shining moment. I really can't say he's sung better on any other album. He's always sounded awesome...but this is another level entirely. Likewise, Hammer is on fire here and lays down some of his heaviest riffs in recent memory. The definition of underrated.<br /><br />Every track on this thing is worthy of attention whether its the dark, mid-tempo crush of Mother Of All Lies and To Fool A Nation, the face melting stormers The Iceman and Hooligan, the ultra groove monsters Motherland and Who What Why Where When, the top-flight melodic metal of Why So Serious and I See Ghosts (this one is going to be an absolute corker live), or the lush, commercial stadium anthems Sad To See You Suffer, Infinity, Bullet For You, and Wasted.<br /><br />Wasted, in particular, is one of the greatest heavy ballads the band has ever produced. This is a true modern lighters in the air power ballad. Massive vocals on the hook, that haunting keyboard riff...they really nailed this one. Just brilliant.<br /><br />Motherland marks a new sound. A new focus. A new beginning. If you've never heard Pretty Maids, this is a perfect place to start.<br /><br />Don't be late to the party.<br /><br />10/10
B0063M22QO|3.0|There are so many variations of this game it is hard to find the one you want.  It is fun to play.
1439130833|5.0|I already had this book, and my daughter liked what I shared with her and so I bought her one, too.  I'm sure she's enjoying it.
B004NOH9LC|3.0|It was a lil slow passed. Could have been funnier. But in the end I didn't have to pay for it, so a free movie isn't bad =)
B007FEZQF8|3.0|this is clearly an edition to maximize profit, you will have to end up buying quite a few of these if you really want to get into the story
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|This movie was soooo good, we saw it at the theater and rented it here to share with my parents and they too loved it!
B00908DDZM|5.0|I love this album. Thrift shop is a great song but mackelmore and ryan lewis should be known for all of the great songs the writing and production is amazingly impressive. hope to hear a lot more from both of them!!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Very easy read.  Hard to put down once you start.  So glad Chris Kyle took the time to write this book.
0425263908|4.0|Yes, there are similarities to 50 Shades. Über- wealthy, impossibly good looking male lead with tormented past being the most obvious. But good grief people, it's not like EL James created (and has exclusive rights to) this character type!  Also, I found Eva to be quite different from Ana, in a good way. Flawed but strong as opposed to miss goody who is so ridiculously innocent (and I don't just mean sexually) that its borderline unbelievable. I found the writing and character development in Bared to be much better as well.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you loved 50 shades (and Twilight) because of Christian and Ana you may not like Bared. However if you read 50 because of all the hype and enjoyed the sexual tension while being annoyed by the sub-par writing and/or weak/naive female lead, I think Bared will compare favorably for you.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Love this CD.  Kelly just gets better and better.  Really like the song she sings with Vince Gill.  Wish they would do a whole cd together
B004SBQGHS|1.0|WHY WON'T THIS GAME PLAY ON MY KINDLE FIRE? i PAID FOR IT AND CAN'T PLAY???<br />PLEASE HELP ME GET THIS ON MY KINDLE SO I CAN PLAY.
0374533571|5.0|This book almost made my favorites shelf. It was great, really, and Pat was insanely relatable. But I happened to watch the movie first so maybe I'm biased. I liked that the book was a bit more mellow regarding all the drama, but the plot wasn't as smartly structured as in the movie. His father doesn't gamble, so there are no bets, and we don't find out the source of Pat's or Tiffany's mental condition until the end of the book. Tiffany also comes off as a bit more deceptive towards Pat and he is more angry with her for the deception than in the movie but learns to forgive.<br /><br />I still highly recommend the read. I like that it took optimism to another level: what to do when you really expect things to go one way but they don't, and maybe that's for the best. I have to agree with the author (or more so Pat) that there are already too many literary books with sad endings.<br /><br />As a safe warning, there's a lot of football talk in this book. And even though I hate football as much as Tiffany, I still enjoyed it immensely. It's a nice supplement to the movie.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I gave this book a 4 just for the fact that I could barely keep from reading it in one sitting. I<br />Although it seemed at times to drag a bit it was well worth it.  The relationship between Abby and Travis was definitely believable due to the fact of how ridiculous the author made this guy towards Abby. Travis was  so codependent of Abby that he did everything that you would think someone who is madly in love would do. Even if it is embarrassing to most people he still did what his heart told him to do.
B005LAII4E|5.0|If you're a fan of The Rock and Bruce Willis this is the movie for you. So it's not real, so it's got a unbelievable plot, what movie does. It is a great edge of your seat movie that you will love....Put it right up there with Expendables 2.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|A few bugs but really cool. Love it! One of my favorite games to play. The graphics are very high quality and it fun to play.
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|After hearing their first album this album just sets the bar even higher. They are an amazing band. Would advise to check them out.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Been great.  I keep it with me at school and things like that.  Ive charged 3 times full and only used a quarter of the life.  I would bet this thing is good for 6 charges easy<br /><br />This will be an essentil tool for my backpacking season comin up.  I dont have to worry about my phone dying on me now!<br /><br />Highly recommend one!
B008393Q2O|2.0|There's no point to an app like this that won't sync your notes online.  Google Keep and Evernote are vastly superior products. Definitely not worth $2 for a glorified text editor!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I chose this on the recommendation of a friendly stranger at the theatre after seeing &#34;Quartet&#34; and loving it.<br />I wish more films were like this one and Quartet; enjoyable, non-violent, thought provoking at times, and quite uplifting. I would highly recommend it!
0736041850|5.0|This book is awesome, plain and simple, regardless of if you are a novice or someone who's been lifting for a long time.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Great app, easy to install, works great. I Love that I can view PDF files on my Kindle now. ;o)
B001LF347E|5.0|This DVD set arrived on time and undamaged. I am so pleased with this purchase as this is one of the most enjoyable series I have watched in years.
B00000IUT7|3.0|We bought this engine for our 2 1/2 year old son after he lost his previous Brio engine (which was smaller and simpler than this one).<br /><br />THE GOOD:<br />1)  It is a bit more powerful than the smaller Brio engines<br />2)  It has a tiny switch that turns the power completely off, so if this engine gets piled under a bunch of other toys in the toy box and the main button is pressed down, it's not going to turn on and just run the batteries down.  It's also handy for when your kid wants to bring the engine on a car or stroller ride and you don't want to have to listen to the motor running.  (Obviously, an older child will be able to operate this switch him/herself, but a little one won't have the dexterity.)<br />3)  It makes fun train noises (toots horn, makes chugging noises)<br />4)  It has headlights that light up.<br />5)  Batteries are securely enclosed.  An adult with a screwdriver is required open the battery compartment.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />1)  It is fairly large -- too large to really work well.  It has the ability to pivot (the last set of back wheels can turn separately from the forward wheels), but it still tends to derail or get stuck on curves.<br />2)  If you use it in &#34;backwards&#34; mode, it derails very often.  They should not have included this feature -- it isn't important to kids, and it complicates play because it doesn't work very well.<br />3)  It still isn't powerful enough.  This engine can't pull a 6- or 8-car train up a hill.<br />4)  There are three push buttons on the top: forward, stop, and backwards.  So there's a bit of learning curve for younger kids in terms of remembering which button does what.<br /><br />All in all, this is a nice engine, although not a bargain by any means.  I would recommend it for children ages 4 and up, who will be able to handle its issues (e.g., derailing, getting stuck) without getting frustrated.  For younger kids, one of the simpler Brio engines would be better.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|K<br />Is OK, but hard to understand. But it is fine. Ok cool' fine h Bush has a w w
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing and a thrill to play. My three year old loves it and is a master at it, she's better at it then me. Lol
B008YKGQR4|5.0|Easy to use and it was a pleasant surprise to find it available.I have so much to learn on kindle.<br />Lmfrisbie@aol
0385333846|3.0|I can't say that I'm surprised that I did not care for this book.  I'd read Cat's Cradle a couple years ago, and didn't care for it either.<br />Vonnegut does have some creative ideas, such as in this case, the use of non-linear time.  He also makes good ethical points, such as the awful suffering and pointlessness of war.  You can tell he has had some creative thoughts, it just isn't enough.<br />The main problem with his books is that they are so two dimensional.  Everthing is a list of what is happening, there is no insight into any of the characters.  One never really know why they did anything that they did.  Without this, there is no means for becoming vested in the story.  One does not care what happens to the characters, even the main ones.  If they die, they were only a detail in the book anyway, they were not real people.<br />Also, he needs to stop saying \\"so it goes\\" so much.  A couple times may be \\"poetic\\", but a hundred times is repetitive and annoying.  Maybe he was trying to highlight the pointlessness of death, but there must be a better way of doing so.<br />In the end, not the worst book I've read.  It was easy to read and flowed well.  I'd say possibly better for a younger crowd, such as high school.  I just never cared what happened and was glad when it was done.  And so it went...
B003ELY7PG|5.0|Great read, and solid advice. I have read this a few times now. Great read for anyone working in teams.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A MUST read!  The roller coaster of emotions keeps the pages turning.  I can't wait for the next movie! Bravo!
B00ADQCBEY|2.0|A police officer gets the job done, despite feeding corruption to his gang.  The Captain of the office who wants to make Mayor one day keeps the guy on the force - so two people feed off of each other.  It gives a bad rep to police officials and tries to become a heroin to it's audience despite the corruption.  I prefer watching something else.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Well, as you could tell from the title, I LOVE it! M  mom was the one that got me addicted to the game in the first place! Any who, I now love this game.
B009K0P10K|5.0|This season is Awesome!  Keeps you on the edge of your seat wanting more. Like the show Dallas in the 80's.
0143118706|2.0|I haven't read her earlier books, but was interested in the idea of this book on marriage. Her writing is a bit too cutesy for my taste, and at times even cringe-worthy. There are some entertaining parts to the book, but these are diamonds in the rough. Will not be picking up \\"Eat/Pray/Love\\" any time soon.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|what's not to like? this album is fantastic. his sound has matured through the years and this album is proof. yes. the songs are long but with the beat changing halfway through them, it keeps everything fresh. My favorite track changes week to week. this album is THAT good. &#34;Strawberry Bubblegum&#34; is the current favorite. If you don't like it at first, give it a few listens. if you have a little over an hour during your day try listening straight through like the album was meant to be listened to. you'll get it.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Can't wait to start the third...<br />Must say I have been impressed with how well HBO has honored the books!
B00447L4KA|5.0|I have loved watching this movie growing up. I completely forgotten about it, but when I remembered it, I had to buy it. This movie is very cute and Heath Ledger is more than perfect for the part. Get it!!
1401907725|5.0|I love the cards and use them everyday. The box is very convenient. The cards give such inspiring and soothing messages, make me feel better to get through the day
B005OP7162|5.0|I would recommend this show to anyone who loves good drama like Dallas in the 80's.  Suspenseful, and fulfilling, simply the best.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I never received this book. Would love to read it. Is it available on the kindle? Ignore my rating until I read it.
B004UID2LC|3.0|Not real intuitive. Not good quality. My first time out with the fire and am not sure this is the best right out of the box.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book was interesting from the beginning and it never dragged.  It was an interesting read and required many tissue as one read.  Food for thought and would make a wonderful book club book as there is much to discuss on this book.
B0001ADAVK|5.0|This movie is great for any of those that are into chick flicks, women empowerment, or even art. Amazing cast and great story line! It is now one of my favorite movies.
B0064QNS62|1.0|For a young person to think this is to hard .....I would not recommended this to my friends.  I like to get games for my kids to do will  we  wait in the Dr 's offices to distract them from the time .  My son who is young does not like this game.
B00BVYU2P2|4.0|It's more for young people but it was cute.  Not my sort of thing but I think people in the 15 to 20 range would very much enjoy it.
1401223176|5.0|Pretty sweet book jim lee is awesome and Jeph is Loeb is better this is by far jephs best work. Pretty sweet
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|I was nervous to rent this movie because of all of the bad reviews. My husband and I love this movie. It did what a movie is supposed to do, had us laughing. Is the main female character a whiny? Yes, but this particular actress always has a whiny voice. Some of the movie would be relatable to some and other parts are just not. I personally, do not crap in front of my husband.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids love the kindle fire. Great to use as education tool or to just have plain fun! What a great product.
B00BX2QTWC|5.0|I got this album yesterday and it's all I've been listening to ever since then.<br /><br />This album is an adventure. It is perfect for being in a really big movie (I could see it as the soundtrack to a movie version of the Odyssey).<br /><br />Woodkid uses lots of unique sounds and styles. In his tracks are lots of orchestral parts, lots of intense drumming, a couple piano sections, and his very likable voice that is quite calming. Though not everyone would like this album, everyone would be able to find their special spot in here. The best way to listen to it is to imagine it as an adventure or a story that Woodkid is telling to you.<br /><br />Some highlights for me were: Iron, Boat Song, Run Boy Run, I Love You, and The Golden Age.<br /><br />I am now very excited to see what he does on his next album. Wait no longer to buy this, and let your musical journey commence!
B007WPM4P0|5.0|Real chemistry between Isabelle (Poesy) and Stephen (Redmayne): loved watching them! I feel Redmayne played his character with disciplined understatement, perfect for the damaged man he was, enduring the horror of the trenches.<br />All of the supporting roles were wonderfully done- those Brits can really pull off these period dramas!  Mature viewers only because of explicit sexual scenes and violent depictions of warfare.
B008M7JODC|4.0|We watched the first two seasons back to back in about a week.  Sort of burned out on it but we plan to go back and watch the rest of the seasons.
B00AHSINKO|4.0|A appealing and believable story.  Settings were also convincing.  Meryl Streep is always as good as it / she can get.
B00006GA4C|4.0|Grand Funk in their infancy long before going pop. In terms of their music, this would be the antithesis of \\"Shinin' On\\" or \\"All The Girls In The World Beware\\".
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Start slow, too many pieces. Then it starts to come together and the excitement never stops until the last page.
B006BQM762|4.0|Remember that movie from your childhood?  The one that seems campy now but really wowed and scared you back in the day?  The one where all the characters seemed like kids you knew, and the plot was thick with distracted parents and adults out to do crime?  Well, this is going to bring back all of those feelings.  If you enjoyed the Goonies, you'll enjoy Super 8; 'nuff said.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I've enjoyed this series very much. The British television is a nice change of pace. Looking forward to season 2!
0345529057|5.0|I'm almost done reading the 4th book, I can not put these books down they are just so engrossing and fast paced and I ALWAYS want to know what's next. If you don't like foul language I wouldn't recommend these book but they are great!!
B00BHMF578|4.0|One cannot know how accurate the representations of the real characters and actions were -- representations of what really happened in Iran at that time.  Ben Affleck's character and the Hollywood characters were actually more believable than the six escapees.  The six embassy workers were not especially convincing.  I suspect that more of those six actual embassy workers would have been cooperative and ready to be helped in escaping.  There is always a lot of an &#34;I know better&#34; or &#34;prove it to me - before I can go along with this&#34; attitude from people in the real world, but I am naïve enough to doubt that there could be so much of this in all six of those embassy workers.  Whether that was the writing or the directing, it seemed distorted.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I loved this book. I had heard reviews that it was a must read, but they seemed too good to be true. As it turned out it was everything people said and more. Not being military, it broken down explanations of what terms and titles meant, which was extremely helpful. I'd recommend to any type of audience.
1590171993|4.0|The novel is a bit depressing. The poor guy had a terrible life. I guess it does not have a Hollywood<br />plot.
B000O5B4C4|5.0|How could you not like this movie?? Micheal Douglas and Sharon Stone are a great team is this!! Not only because of the nudity or sex, this is a very entertaining movie!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Great music. Rap that one can actually understand. Great lyrics for the most part and a few very powerful / Beautiful songs you would not expect in this type of music. The only problem I have is that my kids love it too. This is a problem cause he uses the &#34;f&#34; word so many times that I can't listen to this music when they are in the car with me...
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|If you liked Lord of the Rings you will like the Hobbit many claimed it was different from the book and yes it was... they added in some back story on some things and I really enjoyed that.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Saw it with my three-year old and he loved it. Plenty of animals and visual effects. I would certainly recommend it as a family movie.
0395389496|5.0|MY grandson loves the story and will watch it with his friends every Christmas.  Like the fact it came with the book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone! Very touching and inspiring. Great movie too if you haven't seen it.
B00B671VYU|4.0|Good album so far, i havent listened to it much to give it 5 stars. they replaced drummer Jimmy &#34; The Drummer&#34; Hammer with new drummer Mana and they also replaced the Keyboardest Awa with Hella, theyre both are just as good.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Just as people have been saying. Fun hack n slash. Does remind me of DIII a lot. These games are really giving handheld gaming systems a run for their money.
0451196716|2.0|I have been a stephen King fan for years and was very disappointed in this book. It was the same thing over and over just different characters and the end, even though there was a good twist was very boring. I would not recommend this book.  Sorry
B00BBW16HW|5.0|What a great movie, great story line and acting. It is a wonderful thing when others only see you and not your disabilities. Vice versa, someone sees a person needing an opportunity and gives them a hand.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Loved this documentary. If you are a music fan, you will thoroughly enjoy this film. Enough said, enjoy you people!
B005K17RU0|1.0|Deleted this app already from my kindle. Extremely slow to load and the app constantly runs on your device. Not recommended

B00BOLE7X0|5.0|The movie is fitting for our current political climate. The movie points to several current relevant similarities. Most folks have forgotten that this country was based on the acceptance and respect for &#34;God&#34;.

1119963192|5.0|The book is a very worthwhile supplement to the swimsmooth.com web site. This relatively new swim instruction system is the best of them all so far, and I have been studying them all for 40+ years. Their greatest innovation is rejection of a &#34;one size fits all&#34; stroke model. They very accurately pinpoint and illustrate stroke problems (freestyle only), including a whole chapter on shoulder problems. Excellent photo illustrations. Be sure to download the Mr. Smooth free app from the website, look at their illustrative videos, and use their Swim Types quiz to find out what type of swimmer you are and get suggestions for your type. (They also offer DVDs and live courses in Australia and UK - I can't comment.) Combining the book and website with an Intova Sports Utility video camera ($35-40 on Amazon; memory card as cheap as $5) you can very effectively self-coach. Unbeatable investments for any masters club.
0143034901|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  Wonderful characters, interesting storyline, all set in the city of Barcelona.  A must read for bibliophiles.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|V\e really enjoyed it. It was very fun to watch.Lots of laugh out loud moments. Loved by all family members from small children to adults
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Long lost love--found! Best-ever Jane Austen story. I love all her work--Pride & Prejudice with Colin Firth is fabulous--but this version of Persuasion really does &#34;take your breath away.&#34;
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's exciting each season, I love the actors and the storyline. The development of the cast from season one to three has progressed so much! It's awesome!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I found this one fun to play. just wish it had more free plaaying time.i would have liked to complete the level I was on
B000LTAY1U|4.0|So far this watch has far exceeded my expectations. The one thing that I am a little worried about is that each month when I go adjust the date I feel that I may break the winder. You do have to keep wearing it or it will stop as it is an ECO watch and has no battery. I love the fit and it has quickly become my daily watch. Highly reccomend - Noticed that Amazon offers quite a few colors to chose from.
0547848412|5.0|If you admired the movie, you will really love the book.  An extremely well-written, incredible tale.  A triumphant story of survival of both man and beast.  The best kind of escapism out there!
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|This movie was cute, adorable, touching, and just overall I loved it. At first I didn't really like the choice of Chris Pine for the main character's voice, but after a while I changed my mind. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
0765325950|5.0|I've been eagerly awaiting this final volume of one of my favorite sagas, and I wasn't disappointed!  Will there be more to come?  I sincerely hope so!
0307341550|5.0|Great read. RIveting and every bit as good as her bestselling Gone Girl.  Flynn is one of THE best writers out there.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND
B00ATDOVNK|2.0|ok but the free adition needs to be longer.  just started the game when I was locked out. very upsetting.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|Ap is compact, very responsive and offers variety of views and colors to show signal strength and secure/unsecure status of detected wi-fi-signals.  I'm keeping it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love this app, let's you connect quickly to your facebook acoount. you can be on there at no time at all chatting with friend's, playing game's , etcl
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I really think the book is good, but is too long and you end up forgetting what you read before when you keep on reading. You understand the story as whole, but is very hard to remember all the stuff because it's too much information. I kept thinking how great it would be to have a storyline with a summary of everything ...
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Whereas season 2 was somewhat slow moving, season 3 picks up the pace dramatically. There are some slow moments, but overall the tension and suspense maintain throughout each episode with the addition of new characters and developments. The finale failed to deliver as expected and could have been done differently, but overall a great season that only sets expectations higher for number 4.
B000N6U0DS|5.0|the movie speaks for itself. Will smith does a great job and his son is also flawless in this movie. Very inspirational
B0071XO8RA|5.0|On par with Foundation and filled with the passion and depth of character of Hunger Games.  Satisfying, well written, well edited, and overall a &#34;must read&#34; for all fans of the dystopia and post-apocalypse genre.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I really didnt want to read this book because all anyone  could ever talk about was, Ana & Mr.Grey sleeping  with itg each other . But it is so much more  then that  it's  a action packed love story with plenty of family secerts and  blackmail. The more you read the more you see them  not only grow as people  but also as a couple . In the  end all girls would  like a Mr.Grey drama and all.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|Amazing piece of history... wow. It just amazed me, really cool to see the pictures at the end and how all the people ended up!!
B008476HBM|5.0|I love Jane Austen. She makes us really identify with the characters and teaches us about a time when love wasn't everything in a relationship, but her heroines are so passionate and have strength to fight for their feelings.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I love all of the new enhancements in this game. I just wish there were more levels. maybe that will naturally lead to a third game.

B00479SVBU|2.0|I really can't rate it's performance. I was disappointed as I was like a little kid waiting for it. They do not offer an exchange which is unfortunate. I sent it back with no hassle and was promptly credited my money. Satechi Customer Service, did followup to check on me. They apologized for my problem.<br /><br />I am elated when any company will gets back to me. I am going to order from them again, I just want to look over there different models. I recommend this company.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very good read with just the right level of suspense!  The chapters were the perfect size to keep me saying &#34;Just one more chapter...&#34;.  The only negative was the lack of sleep I got until I finished!!  Great job Hugh!!  I'm Shift now, and it is great as well!
B0083Z614S|5.0|My three and five year olds were captivated by this book! I had read it as a child and loved it and thinking they might also we began our journey through the secret garden! They begged for chapter after chapter! It was just as amazing for me the second time as it was the first! A must read for children and adults of all ages. The magic of it will inspire the child within!

1416979174|4.0|My school recommended this as a textbook of a different title and my students loved reading. The book helped me in my career as a teacher as it engages my students as I used the book as a tool in my workplace. In fact I read it at home and the book just drew me in the author's world even as an adult. Plus, the book came with real seeds which allows me to try growing in my home.<br /><br />I liked the book despite its tiny size. I would recommend to fellow teachers or educators.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|This is definitely not a comedy. I did like it ok - but it hit a little too close to home for me :)  It is somewhat depressing but not as horrible as reviewers are describing it. Good for a rainy day.

B008M0NDOK|5.0|I am not, nor have I ever been, a hardcore gamer. I've played PC games and owned some consoles in the past, but gaming is not my #1 hobby. When I have time, I like to play a game here and there but just don't have hours and hours of time to sit in front of a TV and play on a console. This is why the great quality games that are coming out for the iPad have been great for me. If I have an extra 10 minutes, I can grab it and play for a while no matter where I am.
B00846REIS|4.0|I enjoyed the story line and YES there were some similarities to Fifty Shades of Grey, but none the less it was a fun and sexy tea

0316187216|4.0|Without justice or meaning is how the Red Country is described early in the novel, and the description is as true of the imaginary land as it is of the novel itself.<br /><br />Yes Abercrombie's prose and plot is as tight as always. Things start quickly and never really let up. The grit and blood and anger that drives Abercrombie's characters is here--rendered as remorselessly as in any of his previous works.<br /><br />Yes Red Country takes a different turn themeatically than the other novels in the First Law world. As others have noted it is distinctly Western. But here the \\"Western\\" genre is distinctly nihilstic. It is Eastwood's ruthless \\"Unforgiven\\" with more than a touch of McCarthy's \\"Blood Meridian\\" in which men and cultures and landscape annihilate one another and themselves with a feverish abandon.<br /><br />If you liked his other works, you cant help but love this.<br /><br />But... at some point, sooner or later, it would be nice if we could believe that this all means something. That it is more than just sound and fury. That there is meaning or purpose to it all.<br /><br />So far, Abercrombie has delivered precious little of that. And on that basis I am giving Red Country only 4 stars.
0345803507|5.0|I think the third book answered some Unanswered questions about Christian's childhood and it also left the ending open to continue in later years.

B001UE27X8|5.0|In his book, Life is a Gift:  The Zen of Bennett, Anthony Benedetto (aka Tony Bennet) describes this collaboration with the great jazz pianist, Bill Evans, as his best.  Indeed, he stated in his memoir that other jazz musicians would ask him to sign a copy of this album.  I'm not sure all listeners appreciate the many takes, but if you label yourself an audiophile, you may appreciate this complete recording.

B008DBF5Z8|3.0|I just today received this camera and I want to give it a quick initial rating of 3 stars before I forget my \\"unboxing\\" and first experiences. The camera arrived very well packed and protected in a nice outer box. The inner box has a convenient carrying strap and is easy to open. The software CD is cleverly placed on the inside top flap of the shipping box. So far, so good.<br /><br />Now I wanted to install the software on my MacBook Pro (OS X 10.8.3.) Here is where trouble started.<br /><br />I decided to download the software from the ipevo.com site. The site has a zip for Ipevo Presenter software which unzips to hundreds of individual files. I am still not polished with my OS X software installation skills, so I wasn't quite sure whether \\"just unzipping\\" the file would work, or if it does, whether it would work for all users on the Mac or just the administrative user. Frankly, I was expecting a *.dmg or similar installer file that could automate the installation for me. The Ipevo website does not give software installation instructions. The paper \\"Quick Start Guide\\" doesn't give detailed software installation instructions, either. It just tells you to install from the CD.<br /><br />So, being uncertain, I decided to use the CD instead of download the latest software. The CD does indeed offer a dmg installer file for Ipevo Presenter. I double-click this and try to install the software, but the installer software does walk me through the installation process with user-friendly screens. Oh please! This is just absolutely stupid. I paid $94 and the software doesn't tell me when it finishes installing? I had to \\"try again\\" with the CD, because evidently, my first installation attempt didn't really install the software. There is no screen saying \\"Installation is now complete.\\" Ipevo, you need to do better than this with your software. A whole lot better. The current software offerings just stink of \\"rushed to production\\" and \\"not user tested.\\"<br /><br />Another problem: there is no Linux software, and I use Linux a lot. (I know Mac OS X is Unix based, yeah.) My big problem so far is that the software provided comes with no user-friendly installation procedure and the website doesn't offer installation instructions for the downloadable software it provides. Both these things are pretty much inexcusable lapses.<br /><br />The extension arm that the camera is mounted on feels flimsy. I worry that it can get bent or broken easily. The device base could be heavier, too. I'd probably add another 50 grams of weight to it if I were the designer. The bottom of the base, which contacts whatever the base is resting on, is a bit sticky and grit can adhere to it.<br /><br />The actual images from the camera are okay. I will post my first 3 images later on. The image quality is good enough that I want to continue working with this camera. In fact, the image quality is why I didn't knock the rating down to 2 stars.<br /><br />Update 04/10/2013.<br /><br />Images are still acceptable. Lighting is very important for good image capture.<br /><br />The camera appears to work only if the Ipevo Presenter software is installed. The camera does not respond to the Mac OS X \\"Image Capture\\" application.<br /><br />The camera does not come off the stand.<br /><br />The metal arm that holds the camera can only extend (reach out) and raise or lower. You cannot rotate the camera sideways or upwards.<br /><br />You have to work with the USB cable to make sure it does not interfere with the object you wish to photograph.<br /><br />I will update this review in a few weeks.em: there is no Linux software, and I use Linux a lot.

B009OYSFDM|5.0|Reminds me of a spin off of Batman or something but has two great story lines - one of his maturation and change on the mystery island and then of his activities when he returns home.  I watch these episodes several times - they are great fun.

B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I admit that I didn't start watching this show until the seventh season and then managed to watch the first seven seasons in just a few months. Now I have to wait for the episodes to air and that sucks. But, having it pop up in my Amazon Library is great. Like a little present to myself. If you have enjoyed any of the Superatural shows then this season will be enjoyable too. If you haven't ever seen it please check out the pilot and season one first. You'll quickly become an addict as well.

B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I liked it because it has historical implications, but it was very slow moving and not as good as I expected.
0316223239|5.0|Initially it felt like a chore, but the story took off rapidly after the first 50 pages. Very insightful novel. I am glad I bought this one.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|I loved the complexity of all of the characters, all of whom did the unexpected and accepted each other with humility.
1594746168|5.0|This is an excellent read as well as a great art book as well. The first half is the biography of the fictional Dr Black; his childhood, his education, his marriage and family lif and his disection of a fawn.?  Yes, a fawn. He theorizes that the semi-human creatures of legend might be evolotionary offshoots of humanity. He gets disgraced in the medical community, but turns to the side-shows to show off his \\"recreations\\" of the creatues of legend.<br /><br />The second half of the book is the art of his \\"recreations\\" shown as medical diagrams of the skeleton and muscles of Mermaids, Centaurs, Chymeras, Harpies and more. I do hope we get a follow up book, there are no many other creatures they could show; Nagas, Lamias, Gryphons, etc.<br /><br />If you are a Role Player, then this book would make a great prop for your game and possibly give you some ideas for new adventures as well.
B0002V7OI8|4.0|Gotta wonder what movie execs were thinking in the late Nineties.  (Frankly, you gotta wonder what movie execs are always thinking.)  DEEP IMPACT was released roughly the same time another comet calamity epic came out--the blue collar [[ASIN:B00000G3PA Armageddon]].  Maybe these execs were expecting something to fall out of the sky other than screenplays and bonuses, but I digress.  Told basically from the point of view of a TV anchor (for sparsely-watched MSNBC, for goodness sake), DEEP IMPACT, for the most part, tenderly portrays the human race coming to grips with the ultimate Doomsday as a massive meteor hurtles through space towards the planet.  Led by a charismatic, determined president (Morgan Freeman is always solid), the masses look on as the government multi-tasks to attempt to alter the comet's orbit--and prepare a maze of underground tunnels where a computer-selected few will ride out the chaos of a post-apocalyptic world.  And when the NASA mission to change the comet's orbit goes awry, the masses run like rabbits for high ground.<br /><br />Tea Leoni plays the journalist who \\"breaks\\" the story the Feds do not want made public--namely, there's a big rock coming.  And for me, this development took forever and a day to unfold, almost causing me to reach for the remote.  But once humanity is brought up to speed and the NASA crew is dispatched (with a subdued Robert Duvall playing the mission commander), DEEP IMPACT goes about its business telling, and subsequently wrapping up, several subplots, including the journalist's reconciliation with her estranged father (Maximilian Schell).  Another subplot includes a teen who garners some notoriety by \\"discovering\\" the meteor (Elijah Wood in his pre-Frodo days) desperately attempting to save his girl (Leelee Sobieski) and her family.  Finally, there is a very poignant moment when the NASA crew elects to pay the ultimate price by stopping the largest part of the rock, which has broken into two pieces.  *Spoiler alert!* And the effects, as the smaller piece actually crashes into the Atlantic, are spellbinding.  Yes, it's a tad too long, and takes too long to get going, yet once DEEP IMPACT focuses on the upcoming disaster and has its characters react accordingly, it becomes one very good End of World Epic.<br />--D.

B009IEXKXI|4.0|I bought this book on a whim and what a surprise it turned out to be.<br />Not much character development but a good read.  I couldn't put it down and read it in a day.  The basic plot is our hero is stranded on mars and needs to stay alive by his own wits and a little help from NASA and JPL.

B0090SI4LU|3.0|Like when I read Stephanie Myers' Twilight series, I felt the Host had the potential to be really great but fell short due to the focus being too much on a rather forced romance and not on making a believable and well-rounded story. And just like the Twilight movies, I watched the Host hoping those problems would be corrected and its potential fulfilled. I was disappointed again. Granted, the Host is a much better story than the Twilight series, but there's so much back story that goes unexplained that it's frustrating and there's so little action that it feels like nothing really happens in the couple of hours it runs for. Nothing, I should say, except 2 boys kissing 2 girls who share a body, while the girls fight each other in their minds and Melanie bites and slaps the guy she's apparently madly in love with (he smacks her too so I guess they're even). Well, some other stuff happens too, mainly the Seeker searching for Wanda and some random dramas like 2 guys killing themselves, Kyle trying to kill Wanda and Jamie scratching himself and nearly dying. But it's pretty obvious the love quadrangle was supposed to be the main point of the story. Which is fine, I like a love story as much as anyone else. But the movie needed more. Wanda's other lives and how the invasion happened goes unexplored and there is next to no action between the surviving humans and the souls. In fact this movie has the worst climax I've ever seen. It feels like the Seeker was only used as an excuse to get Wanda/Melanie to the caves and as a reason for Wanda to leave Melanie in the end. Also, the very end of the movie feels completely out of place with the rest. There are other problems with this movie, but I can forgive the chrome paint on the vehicles, the lovely but out of place soundtrack, the \\"Store\\" and how unrealistically fast the cave people accepted Wanda and Ian fell for her. But not the incredibly stilted dialogue (especially Melanie's slightly overdone VO), the horribly nice alienswho don't mind mass genocide and Wanda being a respected and experienced millennia old body snatcher who is basically outmanoeuvred by a 20 something woman. If you read the book you get a better understanding of Wanda's reasons for her actions but in the movie she comes across as a little too weak. If I'm honest I think it would've been better as a trilogy starting with Melanie's story with the invasion and Jared and then the Host (with more human/soul conflict) and finishing with a movie about humans actively fighting back.  Credit where credit is due Saoirse (I'm sorry if I spelled that wrong) did an amazing job, there were many talented actors in this movie. And honestly it's not an unbearably bad movie despite everything above, but it is seriously lacking in excitement.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I realize there are a few inaccuracies in this movie but over all it is a good example of how our government works. Freeing the slaves, giving them the vote was our Christian duty as a nation. All mankind was created to dominate the earth. It as a bit slow moving for my husband who was falling asleep. Acting was A+++++++++++++++
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This show has it all.  The cast was well done and the true star of the show is Archie Panjabi who's sexual innuendos and brashness keep you wanting more.  We completely enjoyed season 1 and are currently watching season 2.
B000GWE44U|5.0|The Ring and The Orphanage are the only current ghost stories I can think of that can even come close to the bar that Kubrick set for haunted house films that stick with you. If you haven't seen it, jeez louise what are you waiting for?

B000YAA68C|5.0|I had seen the movie abailable, but I hesitated for quite some while, thinking it was going to be a very sad one. Then, one day I decided to oh, just go ahead, a good healthy cry wouldn't hurt me. So I rented it and watched it. Surprise!!!<br />This was one the happiest movies I've ever seen! Altho at times, I heard myself go &#34;AWWWWWW&#34;, it really was fun and funny and more fun! An honestly upbeat movie, with some pretty deep advise given by Cathy Bates to her daughter. It was alll good. And it is a keeper. We can all use her sort of advise now and again.<br />  Of course Mr. Butler was gorgeous and did fine on his job.(surprise! He sings pretty good). And Ms. Hillary Swank and Lisa Kudrow added to the enjoyment of in my opinion was a VERY good movie. A keeper.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|I purchased this item for a little more stability in my video productions.  The unit delivers that although sometimes awkward to handle correctly it does considerably help with stabilization.
B007K3JCAE|4.0|My fiance and I went on our first date to see the first movie. We loved it and each other so when the second one came out we went to see this movie as well. We happened to be in her home town visiting family at the time so she was showing me around and telling me about stuff, so we were having fun. Then when we watched the movie we were riveted the whole time.<br /><br />It's nice to have those memories as I watch this movie again. And it's a blu-ray so it's good quality.
B005LAII80|5.0|I saw the in the theater in 3D the blu-ray was just as good.<br /><br />The movie is just as dark as the original. The writing, acting and direct was better in this movie.

B000JQU4TW|3.0|I watched the movie first and it intrigued me to read the book.  Even though the book is a classic the movie seemed to be more complete of thought. The endings are different and his bad deeds are more fully delved into. Just watch the movie.

B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Well done...really tells the personal story of Lincoln and is perfectly acted. Daniel Day Lewis is brilliant and Sally Field is in a class by herself. The story is something not regularly discussed. It's good to see something different about Lincoln.
1582701709|5.0|An exceptionally inspiring book that calls for self-exploration. This book offers practices that deal with the consciousness of one's own thoughts and how those thoughts are emitted into energies. I found this book to be thoroughly helpful for my own mindfulness but it's certainly not for everyone. I offer these practices to those who are open-minded and curious about both spirituality and physics.

1400069807|5.0|The writer of this book was recently on Dr Oz explaining why he wrote the book, and I was interested in reading it, so got it via amazon.  It is on the best seller lising right now, what I have read so far is excellent and very believeable and acceptable.  We all need to educate ourselves about our foods in general and this is a step towards doing that for yourself.  It kind of reminds me of the tobacco days when those manufactors insisted that the tobacco would not harm us yet we all know they do, and finally that is widely a fact shared in general.  This book is on the same type of explanation of how salt, sugar, and fat impacts us also in a negative way.  I'd suggest your read it and learn.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Recommended reading for anyone who owns a bug-out bag. Shows what the Man is capable of when authority isn't questioned.
B00APJLEGA|5.0|interesting characters with really funny parts.  She is quoting it all the time.  g g g g g g g
B002HSSAY6|1.0|Went on and on and on...could have told the whole story in 30 minutes. It was great to see some of the great actors, but whoever wrote this was terrible, only to be surpassed by the error in judgment to produce it.
1609611543|5.0|Recently I've been learning more about gluten and how it can affect us to the negative ----I was impressed by the writer of this book, bought it and am so glad I did----it really will give you alot of knowledge most of us don't know about wheat and gluten and how they may affect us if eating them.  I myself learned that some of my physical problems are due to eating much more wheat than what my body can use in a healthy way---I did some of the exercises this book recommended and was so surprised when a number of my ailments cleared  up quickly and didn't return until I stating eating too much wheat and gluten once again.  I'm a believer now of learning as much about this and following it as possible ---- because I suffer a lot less when I do that---its difficult, I love breads of all kinds but they don't work well in my body.
B0016492BW|5.0|Classic movie, was excited to see it in Blu-Ray.<br /><br />I think the raw humor is just plain fun, the perfect comedy for a rainy day with friends.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I used this book to help me publish my first kindle book called \\"shadows\\" by Francesca Tia Peterson, and it has enough information for tips on writing a basic ebook but if your novel is going to have some graphics or charts or whatever it doesn't go very \\"deep\\" into everything, like I said it's good for a simple e-book but not as good and informative as it could have been.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Multiple versions when online and offline versions too.  This was shown to me by a pastor and is awesome!. Tell all friends as the most perfect bible!
0060899220|4.0|This book was a pretty good read, and a real look into the world of a chef not a celebrity, food network type cooking show.  But it's not just about cooking you read and see how someone falls in love with food, cooking ups and downs, crazy stories,  funny as well.  I like to cook a lot and every one suggest I should try becoming a chef. But it takes more then just knowing how to cook for yourself and friends. it really is hard demanding work, and to be good at it you must have that passion and drive.  I like to cook but not like that.
0764004301|5.0|One of the classics, and yes it's vhs so the imperfections do come through but if you like this movie, and you're from this era, you aren't expecting perfection  and are perfectly happy with good quality and good enough to enjoy whenever you want.
B00007KGCW|5.0|You can't go wrong with &#34;Finding Nemo&#34;. The kids will want to see it over and over again. Ships fast. I got it for a better price VS the store. Didn't skip. I recommend it.
B003TSEEDY|1.0|Normally I always choose a book vs a movie based on a book. This was the first time I hated the book and loved the movie. The book is very poorly written and didn't hold my interest. It's pretty juvenile. I read it in a day just because I don't like to give up on a book if I paid for it. Do yourself a favor and just see the movie. The movie is amazing.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent read. The second book of the series has tons of twists and turns begging you to read on. The capitol has issues beyond the Quell
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I like the song. I'm required to type 12 more words for this review so now I'm just killing space.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|on time good product brand new original SONY's<br />Had fear of getting Sony copy but what I received<br />was exactly what I ordered They are great earphones.
0345803493|5.0|this trilogy was just amazing..loved it cant wait for more....Is E J James going to continue on with her writing on this story.....?
1423124111|4.0|If you love the parks and are nostalgic for the days when Disney's mid-century graphic artists were some of the best in the world, you will enjoy this book. I only gave it four stars, however, because:<br /><br />- There are no artist bios at all! Not ONE single page devoted to Bjorn Aaronson or Sam McKim? Heck, there isn't even a picture of an artist in the whole book. Why? This is a shocking omission I hope the authors remedy for future editions, because without insight into the creators, you gain no real understanding of the artistic process.<br /><br />- It needs more concept art and fewer modern posters. Again, the concept art gives you a window into the process and teases the reader with &#34;what could have been.&#34; I know the Disney vaults contain thousands of these preliminary sketches, so why not include at least one example with every iconic poster? I would much see see more examples of this than some of the poorly drawn Toyko DisneySea posters (what were they thinking with the Mermaid Lagoon Theater poster?).<br /><br />In all, a good book to help you retain that Disney feeling, but one which falls short of its true potential.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This is the best game it is like the ds version but even better different levels more fun an can do anything if you try the game do the angry toaster
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|went fast but had good strategy......I don't feel 4.99 is worth it to continue though. I will however continue playing G5 games
B007BVOF8E|1.0|Very dreary, slow moving movie.  Would not recommend to anyone.  A disappointing experience overall.  Sorry I rented it and only watched about one quarter of the movie.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Love TLJ.  It was a good story line with a little twist to it.  I would probably watch it again in the future.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|some objects cannot be clicked on due to the wordlist bar being in the way. there should be a way to minimize it or move the picture in order to get to the object
0547569653|5.0|As a runner who is interested in ultra running, healthy eating, and overall healthy lifestyles, I really enjoyed this book.  I became interested in Scott Jurek after reading &#34;Born to Run.&#34;  And when this book was released, I quickly borrowed it from the library.<br /><br />I'm certainly not one who feels he can critique someone's writing ability. And while Scott may not be the most polished writer and may not put down the most fluid sentences, the critical reviewers must remember that Scott Jurek's a runner. Not a writer.  And that's one of the things I enjoyed about the book.  It reads like it was written by a real person. With personality.  I enjoyed the insight into his personal life and his history. I enjoyed about reading what it was that made him who he is.<br /><br />I also thoroughly enjoyed Scott's explanations of his vegan lifestyle. While I'm not vegan, or even vegetarian, I find there are very healthy aspects of most any &#34;diet.&#34;  I've made several of Scott's recipes from the book and have enjoyed them all.  In fact, it was the included recipes which prompted me to purchase the book after returning the borrowed copy to the library.<br /><br />I can certainly recommend this book to any person interested in running, ultra running, inspirational stories, veganism, or just plain healthy living.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Fast paced and fun movie.  Love the special effects and all the gadgets.  A good story line for fictional stuff.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|It's one at a time, but I am able to do 100 in an hour including transferring to the computer.  This price vs $1000+ for a batch scanner was a no-brainer for me.  Not a true scanner, but the quality is at least as good as my first 1.3 megapixel digital camera, probably  better.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|...and had to get a copy.  The music, the interviews with those old blues musicians --  absolutely wonderful!  The final jam session in the old church in Salina, KS, makes the set worth the purchase by itself -- but there's so much more.  Hoping there's another -- a part 2 -- someday before all those old bluesmen (and women) are gone.  Excellent!!!
B002BWP49C|2.0|Breaking Dawn 1, in which we learn that weddings are incredibly dull unless you have something personal invested in it (like family, friends, or fans).  As I could not possibly care one way or the other whether these two nitwits got married or not, had a postcard pretty honeymoon, or had a difficult pregnancy, for me this part just dragged.  I will say I've never seen a bride look so dead before she's dead.  Her expression going down the aisle conjured up images of constipation.  One would think she was on her way to her own execution!  Oh wait; this is the part where Bella becomes good as dead Bella, dead Bella, and dead-dead Bella.  Except for a little CGI, I couldn't tell the difference.<br />Never has so much time been wasted imparting precious little.  With so many songs and montages, this half ended up looking like a very long music video.  I wasn't surprised to learn that this film actually caused epileptic seizures in some viewers.<br />Dumbest moment, Edward confessing to Bella that he killed people.....but only bad ones.  MMMM-yeah.  He is a vampire after all, was anyone shocked or surprised by this admission!?
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Definitely an action packed movie.  Like it a lot; nice movie to just sit back and not have to think.
B003VANOFY|1.0|Had this headset for several months and it worked fine. After installing a second SSD on my computer, and re installing windows, the headset no longer is usable as it constantly crackles and pops while just listening to music. The \\"fixes\\" posted on the logitech website are so far flung that even when I did try  them it cost me more money to just use my headset, and did not fix the problem.
1592536913|5.0|Just WOW!!!<br />The photography for this book simple gorgeous. Makes me want to change my whole decor to steampunk! :)
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|The major package, which you can buy, this version not available in Mexico. in my audio system 6.2 A / V Marantz Speakers Klippsh SR 35 and a pair of Infinity subwoofer 10 &#34;, though modest, is living the hobbit. GREETINGS FROM MEXICO.<br />Many tortillas and piñatas FOR ALL
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Not disappointed at all in the third installment.  Still keeps you interesested and the special effects are still good.  Would recommend.
0142428280|5.0|Mr. Follett brings an era to life in this historical fiction. Though not all of his characters are likable, they are all well-rounded, and believable. The circumstances he places them in allow them to act out their lives in ways that respect the historical accounts. And he writes exciting, engaging fiction!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Dean and Sam (as characters) have the best on-screen relationship...they couldn't have picked a better team for this show.  They are great to watch and this show has me waiting for the next episode everytime.
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|I have seen Adele's popularity grow steadily when her songs were sung in the U.S.  Proof of this is the fact that she won six Grammy awards in one year and more recently, another Grammy for her song &#34;SkyFall.&#34; Her voice is powerful and unique.  I own every CD she has recorded.  Of course, her songs are popular in Great Britain, but when she arrived in the U.S. and began singing, the fans were dazzled and still are.
B007ZCOT6C|5.0|Wow this book was an awesome adventure of rich vs poor colour vs whites teachers trying to bring cultures together teenagers trying to better themselves to strive for more than there circumstances Alex and brittney what can I say there love story was epic was bawling for sweet sweet poca stayed up all night reading this book I laughed so loud at 2am my husband thought I was crazy but what can you do this book has some great humor in it I def recommend this story not for the light hearted its a gritty read with twists and turns throughout well done simone fan 4 life!!!! :)
0671449028|4.0|We finally got my daughter into a good bedtime routine and she is sleeping through the night!!!  This is one of the books my husband reads to her at night.  She likes it!  It is a cute little book.  It's hard finding nice, good bedtime story books.  I just wish board books were cheaper (new condition that is).  This one isn't too bad.  I love the last few pages of the book the most.  It is a fun book and then gets really serious and to the point at the end.  And it is an easy reading book.  Some books that have a lot of rhyme takes reading a few times to get the flow down.
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|I've never reviewed music on the internet before. Everything I listen for in soundtracks is in this album. Out-freakin-standing M83. You single handedly made me do a complete 180 on my desire to see this movie.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I love this case! It is not too bulky, like the Otter Box, and protects 100x better than the Otter Box! I wish they made this for all the phones! My husband could really use one as he is a farmer and the Otter Box does nothing to protect it against dust and dirt! They were really thinking of everything when they made the LifeProod Case!
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|I bought this for an Olympus Stylus 770sw that came with a similar card that is marked &#34;M&#34; not &#34;M+&#34;.  I found that Olympus reccomends the &#34;M+&#34; for faster processing of images (video, etc.).<br /><br />This went into the camera and worked great - Panorama OK! - video OK! -stills High quality OK!
B00280LYIM|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. When he gets stranded on the island is probably my favorite part and the ending when Poseidon comes to his birthday party.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|Like the multiple story lines. The acting is very good and the costuming is great. It moves fast. Action is good to
0525478817|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars is a love story, but not one that is romantic or uplifting.  The author has done a good job writing an engrossing book and trying to spice the tragedy of the story up with some dark humor and good natured characters, but this story is a sad one.<br /><br />This is the kind of book that might stay with a young reader for a lifetime, and not necessarily in a good way:  I am always cautious about elementary school aged children reading really dark subject matter because it does shape their thought process.  This book is undoubtedly dark.<br /><br />Still, this is a well-written book and is worth reading as long as you can tolerate the depressing subject matter.
B002NUULNG|5.0|The remake is very good, though some of the newer effects don't blend as well with the old effects I fell they did a great job overall with keeping with the feel of the first film. If you're not a fan of the remake this blu-ray has your back and has included the uncut classic version! I really like this 2.0 version.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This was the hardest book for me to finish out of the three. The first two I finished very quickly but this one was a struggle. The middle of the book was very boring for me and I almost gave up on finishing it all together but it would have haunted me to not know how the trilogy ends. The ending of the book was good though.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was amazing and  incredibly addictive. I fell in love with the characters and it was one if those books for me that left me in an complete book hangover. Great love story
B0076DELIG|4.0|Very good reading. A lot of twists and turns. Keeps you interested right up till the end. A page turner.
B001K98MFU|5.0|This film is good, really good. Is it as good as the first film some say yes, some say no. I honestly loved both, but I still feel the first film was more revolutionary for its time, it had a much greater impact on what anime and sci-fi could be. This is still a great movie and a great film to own on Blu-ray.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|I absolutely could not voluntarily put this book away.  Denise is a new author for me and I totally look forward to reading more of her books.  Obtaining this book in a bundle with other authors is the greatest idea I've heard of recently.  What a way to meet and fall in love with new writers as well as catching up with old favorites.  Even though I had read Debra Holland's Montana Sky Series, the bundle gave me a chance to re-read one of her best. The Twenty-Eight and a Half Wishes was an excellent mystery along with family history of ups and downs.  The twists of the storyline kept me going from start to finish. I highly recommend this author and this excellent book.
B0049P1N3K|4.0|This book was such an eye opener for me and has helped me view and do things differently. From my relationship to how I view and treat myself.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|I've been following this band for a while now and this has to be their strongest cd yet. Love it! For My Sake, Unity and I'm Not Alright are my personal favorites.
B00AYR2FOI|3.0|Like a number of people, I used to be a big fan of Boz Scaggs at about the same time I was an early fan of Steve Miller. I swore off both of them when they just completely sold out and joined the \\"Disco Revolution\\" and put out incredible crap until........well, until they started starving I guess. Anyway, I havent listened to this CD and I wont. Being a sell out is a mortal sin.......sorta like the Catholics look at suicide.<br />I hope the man does well, he once did.
B007SSDBBM|5.0|Not to see great achievements, but simple ones, like a toaster, the Brooklyn Bridge, etc. Meg and Hugh are just great.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|One of best series of TV shows.  Liked the action. Was completely caught<br />up in each disk as series progressed.  Recommend for those who like action.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Finally, you can change your character! I love the new additions like the zip lines and the mines. Nice change rather than just running along a temple all the time like the first one. Great time waster :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|LOVE this game. It like so fun I am enjoying just playing it! You should get it is so awesome!!!!
B001RTP3YQ|3.0|The disc was advertised as like new.  However two songs were un0playable! Had to order my favorite as an extra.
B001NFU5WE|4.0|When I put my order in with amazon, they helped me get and find what I was looking for. The item that I got was listed as new but when I got it, it didn't look too new, the box was not new and had dents and cuts on the box. I wasn't too happy with it, but as for the box and the bat mask holding the blu-ray movies look new. I was happy with the price I got, but the item could of been alittle bit newer, as I thought it was gonna be.
B009FOBMBI|5.0|I got stuck on this album for the first we days I got it. Chalk Outline and High Road are by far my favorites. Sad to see Adam leave the band.. he did an awesome job vocally on this album.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Very fun game even though it took me awhile to get the hang of steering! Once you get the hang of it you'll be busting high scores in no time!!!!!
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book has a great beginning, some funny dialogue, a few interesting twists, but declines until the ridiculously stupid ending.
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|This movie was pretty good but from what I hear it is going to take 2 more movies before they finish the entire book.
B006C1DH92|5.0|I like this so much better than the regular fruit ninja just because of the extra lil games and the Puss in Boots voice. Very fun :)
B000PUV1ZI|5.0|I have always loved the story of Peter Pan. This story of a now grown-up Pan who has lost his inner child was warm and fun. His journey to become the Pan again to rescue his kids from Captain Hook was a great adventure.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is pretty well built and keeps me checking the status of my park every several minutes. Unlike other games of this type your progress stops when you close the app so you have to keep it running all day in order to accomplish tasks. I have no complaints.
B000PY6BBI|5.0|I really liked this movie and it had a great ending where the wolf and the hawk ended up getting to be humans together for the rest of their lives I think.
0521675804|4.0|It's a great book. Really good. It's just exactly I expected. If you want a book for beginners, that's it.
0767836324|5.0|One of my favorites growing up so I decided to add it to the collection of movies that I enjoyed when I was younger.
B00470TOV0|5.0|One of a kind.<br />Every men should see.<br />Phenomenal!<br />This movie/story is absolutely remarkable. If you're trying to find sense - this can be one of your guidelines.
B00005JKZV|5.0|When it comes to a fantasy story it does not get any better than this. Peter Jackson's rendering of the classic is absolutely perfect.
B0058O84G0|5.0|I just love it. if you start read it, you will not have any chance to stop. you will learn a lot about history of th world with amazing story about love, business and life
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Jodi Picoult is a phenomenal writer. There is never a moment of boredom or dullness. The Pact was heartbreaking and I can still picture Chris Harte and Emily Gold. 5 stars.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I had never heard of this movie until Academy nominations. Did not know what to expect.  Just the cover drew my attention.  Makes one think.  I passed it on to a friend and she loved it. We were discussing it yesterday and had two different opinions of the conclusion!
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|Not sure how I feel about this story.  It was poorly written,  on that note,  I did kind of like the story.  To many plots were left unanswered for me.  There were a few fights that I don't know if he won or lost.  Why did Abbey lie about her 1st boyfriend.  The epilogue was BAD!!  In most books I read,  the epilogue goes into the future a bit,  not a few hours.  I will buy the 2nd book & hope for answers
0425263916|5.0|I could not put this book down, just like the others in the Crossfire Series. I read it in a day and a half. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Fifty Shades of Grey or any other erotic romance books. Sylvia Day is an amazing author!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great story about bravery, starting over, and finding real love. Read the book in 2 days and couldn't put it down!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This series is absolutely wonderful.  I don't watch very many series on network tv, but this one had me hooked from the first episode.  Once I started watching, I couldn't stop.  High recommended!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|It is a telling story about enemies with a sense of honor, respect and caring that supersedes all else.  If we could all learn from this, the world would be a better place.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I saw the pain and compassion that Jesus went through for each of us.  I can understand the problems some had with viewing this movie.  We watched this movie during Easter week.  Very profound and moving and meaningful during this holy season.
B009GFEOY8|1.0|This product turned out horribly... Althought i received it when expected, the pictures did not turn ou well at all. I recieved a pack of film expired by two months. Being inexperienced in antique picture taking, i assumed it probably wouldnt hurt to use it. I was wrong. Plus the price was not very friendly... Im quite upset by this purchase
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We loved watching all three seasons and can't wait for the next one to begin. Five more words were required.
6305428042|5.0|This is a movie everyone should see at least once. I fell in love with it as a kid and I will show it to my kids hoping they'll love it too. Either way it makes me laugh. I'll be adding this movie to my Halloween films to watch each year.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|This movie was a Christmas gift - I didn't even watch it.  The person I gave it to is still thanking me for it, so I assume it was very good.  Not my kind of music, but, enjoyed by others.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|Fun game, weird controls at first, the sound is ok, it's difficult when you raise the difficulty, the demo time is short so you can only play for like 15 - 20 mins. You can,just hit start a new game but that starts you completely over which kinda sucks. Other than that if you are looking for some solid fun this game is it you'll have fun for a while but then either delete it or get the whole game. Try it out it's free.
B008393Q2O|3.0|The app functions fine.  You can take any number of notes, Create lists and set reminders on the notes.  It allows you to sort them and color code them.  It is just straight text editing.  Nothing fancy like bold, italics, Underline or bullets.<br /><br />The short fall is the space the application takes up on the screen.  There are two bars at the top.  One with the new, search, text size, format and settings buttons and the other with sort and filter options on it.  These take up 1/4 of the screen in landscape mode.  I have a 7 inch tablet and with the android controls on the bottom and the status on the top leaves you with just over 3 inches of screen space.  These 2 bars take a full inch.  If you go vericle it is less intrusive as it is still an inch of about 6 usable.<br /><br />Would be a great note taking app if they shrunk the size of their bars.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|An all around captivating movie. I love the way it's shot and the music is enthralling. I love the actors they've chosen as well, their interacting is intriguing as always between Sherlock and Watson. Grab the second movie and start watching!
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|What a pure, clean voice he has.  He is so dedicated to his profession and his talent cannot be denied.  Just the next of many albums in his future.
B0064QNS62|2.0|Marv the Miner 2 isn't that great of a game. The controls aren't that great and cause most of your failure throughout the game, sound is ok, the graphics are retro styled which is just a muse to get is school gamers to download it, don't let the graphics fool you this game isn't worth any money, I got it because it was  Free app of the day. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone that wanted to spend money on it.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is suitable for any age. I'm a boomer, and I play this while listening to audio books; multi tasking!
1781164266|5.0|This book is basicly a combination of all the best from the dead space art books included in the limited and collector's editions of the games.<br />Think thats it? Well nope!<br />Detailed explanations on how they created some of the most gruesome creatures from the games and the atmosphere that surrounds  as you attempt to survive the terror!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I passed this book up a couple of times before purchasing.  I'm SO glad I finally got it.  Characters are well developed and it has a great pace!  I read it twice!  It was just as good the second time as it was the first!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is a good sexual to the awesome Temple Run game. Controls are good, sound is great, graphics are vibrant and great. It's a running game so it's a good time waster. Everything is unlockable without having to spend $$$$ and it has game circle which is nice. Great app to have fun with for a while.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|From season 1, episode 1, this wonderful, beautifully crafted and expertly written masterpiece has me under its spell.<br />I've watched each episode 4 times (I think I'm addicted) but obviously, I'm not the only one.  It's one of those things that<br />you fall in love with and I'm delighted that PBS not only loved it but bought it and is keeping most of America very, very<br />happy.  Barbara Wright
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I have all of Andrea Bocelli's albums and this is one that will be played after you have had a very busy day and need to unwind.  If you are in the love mood, this is perfectly named for the event.  Another star for Andrea is in his corner for the perfect selection of songs.  No complaints from this very happy listener and owner of yet another great album.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is AWESOME!  I can't believe it took me this long to actually get it and read it.  I couldn't put it down!  As soon as I finished, I downloaded Reflected In You... Now I just have to wait until June 4th to read the next installment.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game to play when you are bored! PLUS, there are really cool updates that change and they have the keys that can save you like Temple Run 2!
0316226130|5.0|The whole set was fantastic! I was very impressed and couldn't put the book down. I was however surprised by the ending since the movie was different
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|What more can I say about this album.  It was long in coming and will not disappoint.  He is truly in a class all by himself.  This album makes a fine addition to your album collection.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is a great game and it deserves a 5star rating for sure. it takes time to get use to it sometimes.
B005DJREJS|5.0|I stumbled upon Awkward using my prime amazon free videos - What a wonderful surprise for me!!  I watched the first 2 seasons & can't wait for the next to begin. I love the characters & enjoy the humor. Thanks!!
0545003636|5.0|This was such a great book!! The narrator was so animated and good at telling the story, that I felt like a kid again.  Great book for kids and adults!
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I love this film.  Have been wanting to buy it for a while now.  Very pleased with the timeliness it arrived.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a fun game.  I like that you can just tap your move instead of dragging across the screen.
B009FZHYKU|2.0|Character traits flip on a dime, lack of zombies, and things happening because characters tell you so instead of the audience seeing things and coming to conclusions themselves. This show is one great big train wreck of a soap opera.
B000FC2L1Y|4.0|This is a great book for anyone who likes historical fiction.  The action and the factual background are very well researched.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|It's really too bad that this is the last book. It was very interesting to find that Jacob was not a werewolf but a shape shifter. And it was really cool that all the vampires with their different gifts got together. And that Bella learned to control her gift
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this app everyday, you can color code everything in subjects, quick easy to access,editing is fast. also has calendar that nice, My kids use this app in school for notes. I recommend this app to everyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a fun one where you never get tired of it and there is always some new goal you want to accomplish!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Fantastic! Real, believable, top-quality and detailed science coupled with astronomy, and what a style of presentation (part self-narration, part regular third person narration). Creates imagery in the reader's mind as if watching a top-rated special effects movie. No car chases, no guns, no bullets, no combat, and yet brilliantly gripping! Super exciting, super humourous, and super story telling. Full five stars. This novel should command a much higher price.
B008MU8ZOI|5.0|I have loved scary movies since I was little. They certainly don't make them like that anymore! However, I have now seen both 1 & 2 of Jeepers Creepers, and it kept my interest!
B000YDAYCW|4.0|These boots are fantastic. I normally wear a size 10, but based on other reviews I bumped that down to 9.5, and I was still swimming in them, so I returned the 9.5s and bought a size 8.5. They are still a bit big, but I prefer that so that I have lots of sock choices. These are certainly not insulated, so being able to put on a thicker sock is great. I had a pair of these before that I literally wore a hole in the sole, and threw them away not realizing I could have had them re-soled. This next pair will get re-soled when the time is right. I also added some waterproofing spray to them and would suggest you do the same as my previous pair got stained from winter salt water in Chicago.
B00BWI3RTA|2.0|Dido's first two albums were strong, solid efforts, and remain good quality albums exhibiting the greatest amount of substance for her craft.  All albums following that, however, have not measured up even reasonably close.  Though this album is an improvement from her last release, it still lacks in everything that her first two albums provided.  For me, it feels as though she has taken the approach of songwriting and performance as a \\"job\\", rather than her passion.  There's nothing authentic or sincere in this music, and may simply be that she's just trying too hard to return to that quality form, rather than just letting it flow naturally.  The effort on this album is too labored, making it more of a dud, than anything else.  The only songs that I enjoyed on this album are the bonus tracks that can only be found on the deluxe version, but not even all of them are worthy of the talent and potential that Dido has.  Hopefully she can find her way back on the next effort...

B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love all the Angry Birds games. They are all so much fun. My whole family loves Angry Birds! Good Luck.
B00BP3DPJY|3.0|Not a horrible album, and the exhibition of talent and musical craft is definitely there, but what I have a difficult time overlooking is the \\"whining\\" vocal style.  At times it almost becomes a flat-out distraction.  I am not referring to a sense of passion or conveyance within the song being sung, or the lyrics, but a literal style in which the singer is singing.  Only one other vocalist has ever had a singing style that annoyed, distracted, or repulsed me more than this one (Darius Rucker of Hootie and Blowfish... ironically, he improved when he went solo, and his voice took on some life).  It's that aspect alone that will prevent me from investing in any more albums by Phosphorescent, unfortunately.
0446571415|4.0|Get's you interest and holds it. Kind of hard to put the book down once you begin. I highly recommend this author.

B007V5CF5K|4.0|I love games like this and I have had fun with this one but I get frustrated b/c there is no help or assistance button to explain  what the hint button is trying to tell you. I spent 4 days trying to figure out one scene. I was so excited when I found the clue the hint button was trying to point me to! Overall it's  a good game to play &amp; entertaining, worth the money but remember your patience! Lol
B00486070K|4.0|This does exactly what it says it will, but costs a pretty penny. The 480 mb/s of USB is fine for almost any use, unless your doing alot of hardcore data transfer, but I almost never do that with my macbook air.

B000NQRE9Q|5.0|If you love Indiana Jones, you must have this collection.  However it does not ship in perfect condition. You must open the box, remove the disc for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and throw it away. Now you have the ultimate Indiana Jones collection.<br /><br />All three movies look and sounds amazing. And no added bull crap like in the Star Wars films. These movies are just exactly like you remember, but look, sound and feel even more amazing.<br /><br />Buy this set NOW!!!

B008393Q2O|4.0|This app is very simple to use.<br />It has three kinds of notes: text, checklist and drawing.<br />You can color code your notes and have a lot of settings for creature comfort, including super large fonts for bad eyes and different sorting options.<br />You also can backup and restore.<br />There are only two things I don't like:<br />- to finish a message, you have to press the back button first<br />- if you have many messages, it gets cluttered; the developer should add a calendar to filter by date and directly access the desired date.
1476734941|5.0|When I decided to implement this style of eating in my life, I had already been flirting with the idea of intermittent fasting (IF). Weeks prior I would do different variations of fasting between a ratio of 16:8 or 20:4 (fasting:eating). I found the fasting to be pretty easy but the results were not exactly what I wanted them to be. My weight stayed the same.<br /><br />I knew that I wanted to lose weight and mostly bodyfat as I am not far from my ideal goal. I have always worked out but have gotten to a point where I just needed to lose a good 10-15lbs of body fat to be at my ideal weight. During my experiment I stumbled across the documentary of Dr. Moseley and decided I would give his approach a try. With the combination of what I had learned previously and the information given in his documentary I tailored a plan specifically for me.<br /><br />The reason why I think a lot of people fail or give up on IF is because they have not experimented with the fasting portion of this style of eating to make it really work for them. My plan allows me to eat everyday without feeling deprived. Here is how it goes:'<br /><br />Monday- I will eat normally until 7pm. After 7pm I will just have Tea and other calorie free beverages<br /><br />Tuesday- I complete my fast at 7pm and continue eating as I normally would (which is dinner and a few low calorie snacks.<br /><br />Wednesday- I eat my normal diet<br /><br />Thursday- I eat my normal diet until 7pm.<br /><br />Friday- I complete my fast at 7pm and continue to eat my normal diet.<br /><br />Weekends- Are normal without much restriction. If there is something I crave I may have it and drinks with friends usually happens without guilt.<br /><br />(Side note: I do not consume any calories for the entire 24 hour period because I know that I will be put off by trying to constantly find 600 calories worth of food to eat. I would rather not focus on food at all and then just continue to eat my normal diet when I resume eating. Itis just easier for me that way)<br /><br />I have been doing this for the past 5 weeks and so far I am down 7 lbs. I am not far from my goal and I am pretty excited about it! I will also say that I workout 4 days a week as well to compliment my new way of eating.<br /><br />I find this new lifestyle very easy to stick to because I am not depriving myself of whole food groups or things that I love to eat. I try my best to stay at a relatively decent calorie restriction 5 days a week (on my work days) and then allow myself a little bit of freedom on weekends. Not only is body fat falling off of me, but I honestly don't feel like I am dieting at all. I definitely say give it a try and if you find that it is not working for you in the beginning, be patient and try experimenting with your eating times. Best of luck to you!

B008393Q2O|2.0|First - I made the first \\"purchase\\" of this FAOTD app on my PC for my phone and I got an email from Amazon saying that the app was waiting for download - I went to my phone a while later and opened the Amazon app and no app was there to download - checked \\"my apps\\" under cloud and still no app was there to download. Good thing this is the FAOTD because I would have been charged for nothing - so I then \\"purchased\\" the free app again right from my phone and this time it did download - and had this been not free I would now have been charged twice.<br /><br />OK- past the hoops to finally get this app on the phone, I tried it. Skinny - yes - in features (not so much in size at over 2 mb when installed, though it can be moved to internal USB storage). It is a basic small note app. The biggest problem with this app is there is no way to tell it where to store the notes. It has no option to change where notes are saved to - and no indication where it is saving the notes. This app gets 2 stars because it needs to be able to save all notes to EXTERNAL SD. Sorry developers - but memory space on an Android is at a premium and there is little of it. This app needs to be able to access my external SD card where I have plenty of room to store notes and drawings.<br /><br />Until then it gets deleted. Glad I did not pay for this app. There are plenty of free note taking apps that do the job much, much better and give you the choice of where to save your notes.

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|The layout and sequence of the book are wonderful. It is captivating and draws a reader into the moment in time and the relationships between the men.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|Another year in Hollywood and we have another dozen or so films about a future less bright and less livable than the present.  In the case of \\"The Hunger Games\\", the film is a tight adaptation of a bestselling novel of the same name, and the first in a trilogy.  The movie takes place in America, one where the national government has quelled an uprising by those outside the capital, and now has dictatorial control over the entire continent.  The country is now divided into 12 known districts, along with the capital.  The title of the film refers to an annual event held in this futuristic American capital whereby two representatives from each district, so 24 in total, fight to the death in a forest outside the capital.  The movie follows the trials of our heroine as she volunteers for the Hunger Games, trains for them, and then wins.<br /><br />The film itself clocks in at almost 2.5 hours, but it passes quickly as action and dialogue blend seamlessly from slow scenes to fast scenes.  The acting was great, considering that the cast consisted primarily of small name actors and actresses, with an occasional star past their prime thrown in to provide key roles.  The latter includes Stanley Tucci and Woody Harrelson.  The main roles however go to relative newcomers, with Jennifer Lawrence being the standout.  Her unique face complements her beautiful and strong physique very well.  Once we get past the acting however, the rest of the movie is quite average.  The soundtrack was forgettable, which was regrettable given that the multiple settings of the movie offered the movie's makers fertile ground to cook up a wonderful score, whether it be of original creations or rehashed tracks.  I imagine Holst's Jupiter would have been great background music for the chariot scene, while Copeland's Appalachian Spring would have been perfect for the scenes in heroine's home village.  The cinematography was average, with no \\"wow\\" scenes that were chock plenty in other 2012 releases suchas the \\"The Hobbit\\", \\"John Carter\\", or even \\"Brave\\".  The special effects were also low key, about on par with that found in a TV miniseries or HBO special.<br /><br />Probably my biggest complaint about the film was the world it took place in.  The movie takes place in a dystopian future where democracy has given way to dictatorship.  The foundation of this dictatorship is guilt and penance.  The outside districts, as penance for their rebellion, offer up tribute to the capital in the form of their children, 24 of which must suffer in the annual Hunger Games.  This entire premise is so hokey and synthetic.  Human history has countless examples of dictatorships to model a film's context after, but they all share something in common, and that is fear.  Specifically, every dictatorship that ever existed was grounded on either the fear of a subversive minority or fear of a looming external enemy.  Maybe the best example is the Roman Empire, which manufactured fear of both.  Roman rulers stayed in power by selling themselves as defenders of the realm against Rome's feared enemies; first Carthage, then Jews, then Christians, then the Germanic tribes, and finally each other as the empire split apart.  And all along the way there was the fear of slave revolts that really enabled Rome's rulers to maintain a police state throughout the empire.  The gladiatorial combats sponsored by Rome, which was a key inspiration for \\"The Hunger Games\\", was where Rome's captured enemies were disposed of.  Guilt and penance were of little use in keeping Roman emperors in power.  Yet nowhere in this film do we see the national government, the capitol, use fear of the Other as a way to keep its hold on power.  So overall, a film that stands out for its casting and acting; which is a rarity in Hollywood these days.<br /><br />As for this package; well the film on the disc matches the theatrical release; no extended edition here.  The trailers are nothing special.  So for the patient fan, I would recommend waiting until all 3 films are available together in one package.
8866130907|4.0|Fits in pockets nicely. A good buy.
B00AO686G0|5.0|$5 cheaper to get Blu-Ray/DVD combo in DVD packaging. Works for me! At this point, everyone should know the premise and plot of the movie, based on the Who Censored Roger Rabbit? novel.<br />Watched it the night it arrived with my teenage daughter who has never seen it. Still laughed as much as I did back in 88!

B00BZ5RW64|5.0|I was so excited when I heard this album was inspired by classic spaghetti western movies. And after giving it a couple listens today, I am enjoying it even more than I had expected! It is definitely different from their previous albums - and to me that is a good thing. I know a lot of fans are probably not going to be happy with something new, but I personally like when a great band is willing to try something a little different. But it isn't too different if you know what I mean. It's still Volbeat. It's still heavy and melodic and combines various genres.<br /><br />To me this is a band that just keeps getting better.
B00B9LNJ9I|5.0|I have all of DIDO's CDs and she has yet to have a song on any of her CDs that I have to just skip cause it's so bad...So many artists have CDs and the only song that is any good is the one they play on the radio...
B000001FW9|5.0|I've been a fan of the Giant's since I was in my early 20's.  I had a hard time finding their CD's for a number of years and quite frankly I forgot about them.<br /><br />Fast forward 10 years or so when they re released their catalog and I saw Free Hand at my local mom and pop music shop.  Man was I glad I found that one.  I came home and checked out Amazon and found AtT, the album I first heard from them back in the late 80's early 90's.  It doesn't get much better then them if your like progressive rock.<br /><br />If you like Spock's Beard you will love these guys.  Check them out!!!

B00AQB2A3I|4.0|I have been a Steven Wilson fan ever since I bought a copy of Deadwing shortly after it was released.<br /><br />I enjoy all of his side projects as well as his solo and PT work.  GFD was my album of the year when it came out and I listen to it quite regularly.  This one I enjoy but not on the same level.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I'm not disappointed with it It just doesn't hit me like his previous album did.  That being said and it might sound contradictory but there is not a bad song on this CD either.  If your a fan of Wilson you will definitely enjoy it.
B008JFUNYG|3.0|3 1/2 Stars = Very Good<br /><br />Ah, the original \\"Evil Dead,\\", is one of my top ten horror films of all time. I saw it when it came out at the drive-in theater. What a roller coaster ride, with screams echoing through out the parking lot, & funny enough, many of them shrieking was the guys! I always thought years later, that this film begged a remake, as it was shot on a social security budget, & the advances in special effects have came a long ways. Well, I finally got my chance yesterday to see the remake of \\"Evil Dead!\\" What did I think?<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />First thing off you notice about the remake of \\"Evil Dead,\\" is that the acting has improved by light years, not that the acting was of zero talent in the original, but it was very uneven with each actor. Here everyone can act. I guess it helps that you've got more of a budget. The second thing is that the film gives you a prologue, & a fairly good reason why the group of people come to the now famous cabin in the woods for a visit. The third, & the main reason, is the greatly improved special effects & make up! I have to admit, I was quite amazed, not that the special effects are better than any current horror film with a budget, but how graphic they are! The original \\"Evil Dead\\" was one of the goriest horror films of it's time. Even by today's standards, it's gory. I really was not expecting the remake to be as explicit, even more so in the gore department with a R rating than the original! The original was unrated, & back in the time it was made, there was a lot more leniency in what graphic material you could put in a film than today. The fourth, is the main demon is pretty good, though she reminds me of a second rate Regan from \\"The Exorcist,\\" both physically & personality wise, but then again, no one is going to replace Linda Blair as a person possessed! Actually, all the demons were well done, & they were not only sadistic, but hugely masochistic too! So I was actually astounded at how gory this film is, but does all of this make me forget the original? No, not for a moment!<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />Ok, where to start? Well, lets start with the characters & work our way down. As I said, there was good reason why this group of people chose to come to the cabin, but what they did afterward was pretty brainless. I mean we have some intelligent people here, at least their supposed to be. We got a teacher, we got a nurse, we got a caring brother & his girlfriend, & last but not least, his junkie sister, who while being a junkie, seems to be very intelligent. So here's the rub, when they get to the cabin & smell something putrid rising from the basement, they go down to investigate. They find dead cats everywhere hung from the basement ceiling. They find that something or someone was burned. They find (though it's not called this in the film) the \\"Necronomicon,\\" better known as the \\"Book of The Dead.\\" It's all wrapped up in barbwire. So ok, being intelligent people, who think witchcraft has been performed in the cabin, wouldn't you think they'd be heading for the next county? No! The teacher, who'd you expect to be the smartest of the bunch, or at least the one with the most common sense, takes the barbwire off the book, unwraps it, & after being warned not to read the book, by writings in the book from someone other than the author, starts to read a passage out loud. Then of course we all know what's going to happen. Bingo! At least in the original, we get five college kids just looking for a party, not taking anything seriously. It's a lot easier to swallow why this group of kids would turn on the tape recorder listening to the incantations recorded on it, for s***s & giggles, as opposed to the group in the remake.<br /><br />Now the stake through the old Necronomicon! As fantastic & improved as the make up & special effect are over the original, the film lack copious amounts of atmospheric dread. Maybe this is to be expected, after all, it's a remake, right? Well, this film is not a scene by scene remake, it's quite it's own animal, but it could've of benefitted from keeping some of the things that made the original so terrifyingly eerie. One. They could of used the woods to a much greater effect. They practically ignored all what made the woods such a eerily forbidding place in the first film. The woods in the original were in a lot of ways, more terrifying than the cabin it's self! Two. The sound effects were no where as instrumental as the original in creating a dreadful atmosphere, such as the hugely menacing sound the unseen force made in the woods, chasing after people in the original. The swing scene in the original, when the group of college kids got there, & the cabin swing was swaying back & forth, making a bumping sound against the cabin as it hit it, then all of a sudden stopping. Now that made my neck hairs stand on end! No such thing in the remake, & maybe most of all, the spine chilling constant wind, blowing eerily through the cabin! Three. The soundtrack was way inferior to the original's, subduing the amount of tension & atmospheric dread from the first. The original's soundtrack accentuated every little bit of dread, drawing the viewer ever deeper into the film. Four. The first film created a surrealistic sense of insanity, with Ash questioning his own sanity, while sitting in the rocking chair. Ash putting his fingers on the mirror, only to find the mirror was as made of water, increasing the surrealism of the film. Things going bump in the cabin. Things going bump outside. Objects moving by their selves in the cabin. These are just a few things that made the original what it was, a truly groundbreaking horror film. No horror film is going to be thought of as a groundbreaking masterpiece, without atmospheric dread by the bloody buckets full. Something this remake unfortunately lacked. The film was just an excuse to go all out blood & guts, & it succeeded in this, but failed miserably when compared to the original's nail biting suspense, of what was going to happen next. The original keeping you glued to the screen & your hands squeezing the armrest, until they turned white. The remake was just to much overkill. With out the dread, suspense, & surrealism of the first, the relentless gore & violence becomes numbing.<br /><br />Alright, even so I think this film paled against the original, on it's own terms, it did succeed fairly well. It's not near the remake that \\"Fright Night\\" & \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" were, but it is worth seeing, even buying in Blu-ray. For people who have not seen the original, you may think this is a great horror film. For us that seen the original at the time of it's release, the remake is a fun, yet obtuse, inferior rendering of the original. But when compared to the glut of mediocre horror films out there, both big & small budgeted, this is a pretty damn good watch. For you gorehound lovers out there!ake, right? Well, this film is not a scene by scene remake, it's quite it's own animal, but it could've of benefitted from keeping some of the things that made the original so terrifyingly eerie. One. They could of used the woods to a much greater effect. They practically ignored all what made the woods such a eerily forbidding place in the first film. The woods in the original were in a lot of ways, more terrifying than the cabin it's self! Two.

B001U7WUW8|5.0|Great Purchase for any Green Day Idiot (term of endearment for GD Idiot Nation). I would recommend it to anyone.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Loved the movie. Ordered it with the soundtrack. I have it playing in my car. It's exactly like the movie and man that Tom Cruise was fantastic! He can do anything!! Great music and great songs from the 80's!!! Love it!!!!
B003SNJYSK|4.0|found the story slightly confusing  i wish when it was translated it from norwegian into english they would also change the names into english ones ( but i had the same problem with Stieg Larsson ) still a good read
0345803485|5.0|Did not finish the third book yet, but this 20 year old Scorpio is hooked. Can not wait to read the ending. A must read!
B000FA675C|4.0|The Da Vinci Code delivers on suspense and fast-pace, but it sorrowfully lacks in characterization and dialogue.  Putting the latter disappointments aside--which surprisingly do not detract from the book's overall appeal--the book puts forth some very interesting ideas about Christ, the Christian tradition, and the Catholic church.  As I read, I found myself musing on theological and secular concepts that had never occurred to me before.  This is a good book for anyone with an open mind and interest in a fictional/semi-historical take on the Holy Grail quest, the relationship between Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene, and the present traditions of the patriarchal-headed Christian churches.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|One of the best movies that I have seen in years. Truly inspiring. This movie should have won the Oscar.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Could have used a better season finale in my opinion, but still a deserving show. Can't wait till next season.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Was skeptical of the UI and controls compared to the mouse+keyboard controld of the PC.  They seem to have done a good job because my 10-year-olds can work just fine using the (cheap) Android tablet it's loaded on.<br /><br />Bought this for the kids' Android tablet.  Their friend came over (with an iPad mini) and they joined a multiplayer session the moment they weer on the WiFi together.  The interaction was instantaneous, as opposed to over PC's
B0015AARJI|5.0|Works great on my windows 7 HTPC with latest version of motion joy driver.<br />Using on board bluetooth on a zotac zbox ID41
B0017VG69U|5.0|This is such a trip! I love being able to watch these again! Looks good, sounds good, no complanints at all!
B002U3CCKQ|5.0|This book is brilliant and had me pressing the screen again and again like a Gen Y on an iPhone (which is kinda like saying this was a page turner, but doesn't have the same catchy-ness). I'm now deep into Gillian's next book 'Sharp Object' which is shaping up to be another screen-presser.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I got this car charger to use mainly for charging up my Note 2 in the car, and from my own personal experience I use Note 2 every day as GPS to/from work. Everything is usually on (display, bluetooth), plus GPS/Google maps are up, and I take/make phone calls in a middle of all that. What does that mean? Battery is draining really fast, and even with car charger you need at least 2A output to be able to charge at faster rate than discharging with everything on. 2A charger is not hard to find, although question always come up if you can trust their actual rating. If you want to take it to the next level and charge another smart phone, you can probably find a dual charger with 2A and 1A, although reliability and current sharing during simultaneous use of ports might be in question. This new product from Anker took it to the next level where they are offering dual port output with 2.1A and 1.5A outputs and guarantee full current supply from each port at the same time. In terms of reliability, they are offering 18 months warranty which I think is a bold statement of confidence in their product.<br /><br />3.6A, which is 18W, is a lot of power and to my surprise the charger was actually very small and lightweight. The dimensions of the end with dual ports is only 26 mm x 24 mm, and the whole charger is very lightweight and only 22g. This small size is very convenient for tight spaces like in your arm-rest compartment, and just in general is unobtrusive to use anywhere in the car. I know they advertise it as dual port with 2.1A for Apple (obviously iPad) and 1.5A for smart phones, but I confirmed that Note 2 charges perfectly from Apple port. As a matter of fact that would be the best port to use for Note 2 fast charging.<br /><br />Overall it's a great little dual usb port car charger from a trusted company with a punch of 3.6A capacity split between 2.1A and 1.5A ports where both can be used simultaneously so you can do a fast charging of two devices at the same time. Plus you can't beat the price, a real bargain for a brand name quality product!
B00867GHS8|5.0|has 3D, but you need a 3D TV  + 3D bluray player + 3D glasses. ::sigh:: by the time I can afford that, the next electronic media format will be out, lol. Anywhoo, I am very happy with this purchase, it was a birthday present. There is a cool lenticular cover (the ridged plastic with picture layers beneath) Really, we purchased it for the digital copy, because we end up with glorified frisbees no matter HOW well I think I can hide or lock up the discs. we hooked up the PC to the TV, via HDMI cable, so kids get to watch and no discs get scratched, win / win. Did I mention how happy I am with this purchase?
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|my cuz. have instrest in it but I. don't. really I would rather play angry birds seasons.  really really boring
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Believe the hype people, this book is brilliant - it has more turns than a food processor! I give it two thumbs up, three if I had three thumbs.
0151013047|4.0|This book should be read in conjunction with Camus' The Fall. I suspect Hamid based his book on it. The Reluctant Fundamentlist is a book for our times, just as Camus wrote for his time. Anyone looking for and explanation or at least an observation on the key problems of today--Islam and the west--should read it.
B001GCUNW6|5.0|Love, love, love that this was so reasonably priced for a Blu ray, WITH A DIGITAL COPY! YAY, we still have access to a loved movie after it becomes a decorated frisbee. Last month, hubby and I resolved to ONLY purchase movies with a digital copy. We don't go out except to buy groceries and pickup library books (no babysitters post Autism diagnosis), so for us, this is an investment in family entertainment. Very happy with this purchase.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|really read them. Great game. It is honestly great and should br updated on a more regular basis, but it's a great game.
B00BHMETKC|1.0|This film was extremely boring and unless you are interested in the story it will bore the socks off of you.  Not to mention, Ben Affleck looked like he was trying too hard to be a serious actor and that beard he had makes him look like a pervert.  The way it was filmed was not original.  It was filmed in the same style as Babel and A Mighty Heart, the only difference was those 2 movies I mentioned were excellent films.  believe the hype, The Oscars are going down hill and they have been for the last 5 years.
1400069742|5.0|Those Angry Days and several of the reviews of it opened my eyes to a part of American History I knew little about. The more I read about FDR, the less I like him. Although I'm sure we eventually had to go to war, after all Hitler was really a bad guy, the America First and other isolationists didn't deserve such a lousy reputation.Well researched and well written. Charles Lindbergh seems like a character in a film noir.
0345803507|5.0|Loved every book amazing wish there was more each book breath taking fast paced and worldly worth the read James is great
B003G4W49C|4.0|Everybody has different tastes and preferences so it is difficult to buy a book on someones review who you don't know. That being said, I will say that the editing of this kindle is done well without too many obvious typos. I like to read sci-fi, and I enjoyed this one.
B008602KQI|5.0|I go to the movies once a week. I missed seeing The Hunger Games. I was thrilled<br />to watch it on my laptop. I enjoyed the movie a lot. Very well acted.
B007N85POS|4.0|Not much to say, It's Angry Birds. It's a great way to kill some time, and can be addicting. Get it, play it, have fun!
B00B7VPKMY|5.0|just what I was lookin for and it was packaged proper each cd looks just like original lp album art!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is the best game ever. I love it a lot. Is there Temple Run 3? love a lot?!!!!  best
0807126063|5.0|Two hundred and one 2-star/1-star reviews currently on this Amazon page, explains much what this book is about. Toole was genius.
0060273224|5.0|I picked this book up by complete chance in seventh grade and when I re-read it (as I often do) I find myself just as engaged with the narrative and just as curious about the old Kingdom as I was the first time around. This book never gets old. Sabriel is a deep character that is very dynamic, and the tertiary characters are unusually well-rounded even if they fill stereotypical roles. This book is absolutely my benchmark for what a good fantasy should be and I find constant inspiration in Nix's Old Kingdom.<br /><br />If you only read a single YA fantasy this year, this book should be the one. But if you read this book early enough in year, you'll probably follow up with the rest of Abhorsen Trilogy and then it's inevitable that you'll start in on the Keys to the Kingdom. This book is a gateway drug that you will never regret trying.
B002OHN5NQ|2.0|The CTEK 56-261 Comfort Connect 3/8&#34; Eyelet was really an M8 (8mm) model.  The eyelets had to be enlarged with a dremel tool to make it fit a 3/8&#34; post.  Don't try to drill out the eyelet or you'll probably destroy the connector.  Grind it out instead.  It seems to work fine once it fits the post.  I only gave it two stars because I don't appreciate being mis-lead by the description.
B00992CF6W|5.0|everyone should use it on a ipad kindle or ipod phone.It is amazing this is my review for this app.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I have been a long time user of Pinterest (since the beta days) and was thrilled when they decided to finally create a Kindle app for it in 2012. Unfortunately the new update they released this year has caused nothing but problems. My Pinterest app constantly states that it is &quot; not responding&quot; and asks if I want to wait or force close. This happens multiple times a session especially when attempting to look at individual pins. I can see by other reviews that I'm not the only one having this problem on my Kindle Fire &amp; hope the developers resolve it soon. I am a Pinterest addict &amp; love the site otherwise. :)
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Great movie! An inspiring story about Rodriguez. Be sure to see this one! A very memorable movie! You will not regret buying it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Television at its finest.  Tremendous acting, incredible settings, spellbinding plot. Can't wait to get started on Season Three.  Totally enjoyable.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|The string thing totally doesn't work and why waste the time and effort on it.  This little thing is AWESOME.  It's my favorite new tool.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|its a great game that really challenges you to get it right or crash makes you think and move fast.
B0001MLMKY|5.0|classic swatch watch.  can't go wrong with it!  perfect design.  has the date on the face too which is very convenient.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok stop adding a d in sites of a e why because people can tell that it is facing and stop puting minecraft pictures from the computers minecraft .<br /> From baller4life02
B006L0A5P8|3.0|Overall this is a very good application, but I would like it to have more of the features like the iOS app.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|I actually downloaded this book by accident. I meant to click on another one. I wasn't sure I would enjoy the story line but it actually kept me very intrigued and I couldn't put it down. It puts a twist on the typical abusive relationship story and keeps you questioning as to what's real and what's not. Definitely a page turner.
0316789704|5.0|these are fun books to keep the kids busy.  we made christmas ornaments using this idea of the kids fingerprint dressed up with a different character.  gave them to grandparents as gifts.  they love them!  nice keepsakes for the kiddos.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|i love it is the best and easy to use and so much good music and sounds to wake up to
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Fun game, but repetitive. Fun game, but repetitive. You do the same thing over and over again. If you like slow progress toward goals this is the game for you. Also, on the first Gen Fire, there can be some slowdowns that, in a fast twitch game like this, can cause a quick &#34;game over&#34;
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|One of the best game apps on Amazon, it's like warcraft 3 dota, except for tablet.<br /> If you know what that is.
0920236162|5.0|i was introduced to robert munsch books by a friend of mine and my kids love them.  cute stories with good morals behind them.  the illustrations really grab my kids attention.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|i love it and it is easier so you do not have to use a computer to use twitter at all
B009EP3DJM|4.0|Not the best way to start out a review I suppose, but it's true. I did hate Ke$ha with her debut album and Cannibal was a little better, but still not something I could enjoy all the way through. I did enjoy some of her songs though (mostly the slower ones like Dancing With Tears In My Eyes and The Harold Song. I also liked Blind and Kiss N Tell) so I kept following her career, hoping for that one album that would change my mind on her.<br /><br />And finally that moment came with \\"Warrior\\". I can honestly say this album is a game changer for Ke$ha, in the best way, and it's a shame that it charted so poorly. She still has her drunk/party songs that she's known for on this album (\\"Gold Trans Am\\" and the 1st single \\"Die Young\\" for example) as well as slow songs like \\"Love Into The Light\\" and \\"Last Goodbye\\" and songs that are somewhere in between (\\"Only Wanna Dance With You\\", previously just a demo that fans really wanted on the album, finally on an album). The whole album is an amazing mix. And sure, like almost any album, there are some tracks I wish I could do without, but I loved this album and hope Ke$ha continues in this direction with her next one, whenever that will be.
B00947N6D8|4.0|My wife and I purchased this DVD for our grandchildren as an Easter present.  We always screen any DVD we purchase for them.  We found this particular video to be delightful and feel that it's destined to become a classic.
B0027P2ZWC|5.0|i love this musical and happy to have it now on my ipod.  the dream cast sounds amazing!  if you haven't seen this musical you must go!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i love it it is the best idea ever when are they coming out with the third one for kindle fire
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I hadn't read a book like this.<br />I couldn't put the book down.<br />Recommended to those who try new things.
B008MF3OEY|4.0|I like the cover because it feels more like a book rather than holding the e-reader alone.  My concern is, how will it hold up over time.  I guess I'll just have to wait and see.
B007ZTLLMK|5.0|Once you get the hang of the controls this is a really fun simulator. I fly model helicopters (18 + inches)and this is as close as you can get without spending big bucks.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|it is easy to use and easy to post and update status with it and to look up people also
B0098460O4|3.0|I like these two together.  Jonathan is not Pavoratti yet, but he will be close during his carreer.  Charlotte is a nice add.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|T he game is very appealing with nice sound effects. I deleted it just to play it safe. A.  It will not change viewing angle and b:  It will not shut off!
B008YKGQR4|3.0|It's pretty good.  Glad to see the whole page like on my desktop.  Have had trouble with it reverting to the top frequently & I lose my place in scrolling my Wall.  That's frustrating.  I do like it better than the Kindle App, tho.  Wasn't as good as I expected, but it was FREE, so guess I shouldn't complain.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|These are very cleverly constructed games. Several times I thought I'd figured out the strategy entirely, but I was looping around with one color rather than winding the colors around and inside one another's path. Each method got a good result for scoring, but it was way more satisfying to do it the way the game intended.
B00005JPS8|5.0|The minute it showed up in the mail my son had it in the player. Thirty years later, Robert Downey, Jr. is now entertaining my kids too. Definitely recommend it for the tween/teen/parent set. The beginning might be a bit scary for the younger ones. Nothing like a superhero to make a movie night complete.
B004LZFWJO|5.0|A very addictive easy game the only problem is you start it and before you know 3 hours have past!!!!!!
B0055S348W|1.0|This app works fine on our smart phones, but does not work at all on the Kindle Fire.  At $12.95 it is expensive.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|This game is amazing . Just like mcraft.but has electricity.like tekkit.but the is .really 15 minutes .lol .but really good game
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|We loved it. It wasn't any where near as serious as the beginning of the first one. Any family with a tween/teen combo will definitely have an entertaining family night. The language is mild which is a big deal for our family. The action scenes did not go into intense, scary mode. We already have tickets waiting for the 3rd one premiering in May.
0743599101|5.0|This book was everything that I've grown to expect from a Dan Brown novel. The plot was<br />creative and of course the usual thrilling ride.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|It was a fun movie. My 10 year old grandson loved it. I enjoyed it as well. Not sure what the life lesson was, if any. But still a fun to watch movie.
B00B23O96A|4.0|Reminds me of the mood and groove found on There's One In Every Crowd, my favorite Clapton CD.  Though not as good in my estimation, Old Sock sounds sweet nonetheless.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A must play. This game is super fun. Everyone should try subway surfer, especially if your looking for a challenge.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|you can mix several sounds to make one that i fell is great<br />I have not seem anything like it
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I watch this show each week but missed an episode and was so glad I could go to Amazon to download it, even though I had to pay. Thanks Amazon!!!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|watched 5 time and still see and hear things i missed the first time i save at the theater. will watch again and again..
1451627289|5.0|I'm a King fan. I started reading his stuff a few years ago. First a more recent novel or two of his. Then I delved into his earlier works, most of which is amazing. The Shining, Misery, and Pet Semetary are my favorites. As I leisurely work my way through King's writing career I find myself gravitating towards his newer works. Under the Dome, Full Dark No Stars, and now 11/22/63 - they're all really good. The character development is unbelievable. I can think back to what I read of King's, whether it be something I read a week ago or eighteen months ago, and vividly remember the characters in his books. This book is no exception.
B009IUH1N2|5.0|get this app. it is the best thing ive ever done in the car. this app successfuly kept me entertained for a three hour trip.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I LOVE this series and thanks to Amazon I can get it for a reasonable price and watch it wherever and whenever I want.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is an awesome game I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the movies as a kid.......very addicting
B0058YPG2K|5.0|The fourth season of Breaking Bad continues the unward trajectory of its predecessors, a very difficult task in the first place. But through such episodes as Box Cutter, Salud, and Face Off, Season 4 transcends its previous heights and becomes something far more than a television show, and an exercise in short form art.
B000XA5K48|4.0|Good
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This is a wonderfully written script. Classic. I loved this movie. One of those movies you can watch over and over.
B003DKJ5ZU|1.0|This gets 1-star from me for two reasons:<br /><br />1. I ordered it but it never arrived arrived, and the shipper never responded to a single message I sent. Supremely disappointing, though I am glad Amazon refunded me for the purchase.<br /><br />2. This movie is the weakest of the Tinker Bell movies for me. Even my kids (one boy and one girl) watched this once and then promptly forgot about it, which is amazing considering their tenacity in watching the same things, over and over. The plot is unbelievable even for fairy standards, the characters are annoying, and there is not much development. Skip this one and go straight to Secret of the Wings for a movie done right that your kids can enjoy (and you can too).
6305090564|5.0|Had some great one-liners
B007IXWL2C|1.0|the best of the 3, but still not worth it!<br />the topic sells books, but it still isn't worth it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I had so much fun playing this game.  It hooks you in right away and becomes very addicting, very fast!  It's not only fun, but a great way to exercise one's brain.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is good although could do with less of a wannabe temple run.The graphics are exceptionally good gameplay is great
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Very good game lots of fun trying to find objects during the searches. Also liked the storyline that followed the game.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Daniel Craig is a different kind of Bond, and I think he was getting some mixed reviews because viewers were comparing him to other Bonds rather than this film.<br /><br />This film is continuing the origins of Bond, why he thinks the way he does - he's a tougher, more somber Bond who at the beginning of the film with an exciting chase scene through Istanbul, gets shot off a train - and survives!  (Hey, it's Hollywood, that's fine.)<br /><br />I liked this film.  The action was fun but not over the top.  The scenery was very nice - the Shanghai boat scene was lavish. The moody shadow & light show as an assassin gets his rifle loaded up and takes aim.  (But why did Bond let the guy take a shot and kill his target?  That's never explained).<br /><br />The Bond girls were tragic, intensely interesting and Bond's empathy for them was palpable.<br /><br />Enjoyed the back & forth with Moneypenny, as she shaves him closely.  Later they discuss how it's easier to get dressed with an \\"extra pair of hands.\\"  Cute.<br /><br />Yay, we get a \\"shaken not stirred\\" scene at a Shanghai bar, as Bond is watched closely by a gang of toughs about to kill him.  We get a view of the Connery sports car, the Ashton Martin.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /><br />The film made fun of itself at several points, but true Bond fans would get the Easter eggs, and new viewers would be fascinated with the \\"origin story\\" of our favorite MI6 spy, out in the Scottish Highlands (\\"Skyfall\\").  \\"M\\" is basically our co-star.  Bond is serious, has a lot of depth, and Daniel Craig plays him well.  Good film.<br /><br />Cast:<br /><br />Daniel Craig - James Bond<br /><br />Judi Dench - M<br /><br />Javier Bardem - Silva<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes - Gareth Mallory<br /><br />Naomie Harris - Eve<br /><br />B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Marlohe - Severine<br /><br />Albert Finney - Kincade
0823095223|5.0|produto excelente, os resultados foram bons consegui chegar ao resultado esperado, atraves do que ele se propos a discutir recomendo.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It's a good game. Wish it didn't take so long to get energy. Also I thing it should be<br />Easier to earn cash
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love it<br /><br />This was the best series ever....the only problem is what am I going to read next.....maybe the host?
B00005U122|5.0|If you can forget the Roger Waters/David Gilmore &#34;who's the real Pink Floyd?&#34; stuff, and just sit back, crank up the volume, and enjoy a fantastic concert, then I think you'll agree that this is AWESOME!
