B009RH9FR6|4.0|This Kindle Fire HD case is very functional.  It is easily adapted to change from portrait to landscape when necessary.  It is also very sturdy and protects the Kindle Fire.
B0000WN0VY|5.0|These songs are beautifully written and performed. This is someone I'd never heard of, but one song on the radio changed all that.<br />Another must-have CD for my collection.

B00BHHIWQO|3.0|It is quite addicting.  It locks up frequently requiring elimination and reloading.  Also, I can`t get it to sinc with my Facsbook.
B0012HF5NC|4.0|It's a thrill ride and thoroughly enjoyable. It satisfies everyone who can imagine a world in which the possibility of life beyond earth exists.
0770437400|2.0|At first I liked it, but then after the 200 page mark I was finding it boring. I tried to read this all the way through, but I just couldn't get into it. This is the first book IN YEARS that I couldn't finish because it was boring. And I'm a zombie fan, don't get me wrong, I just couldn't get through it all. I felt like I was wasting my time.

B0083ZRAJS|5.0|The book was much better than the movie as it has a lot of material that the movie cut out and is also very descriptive.
0061743526|5.0|Again, if you've seen the movie, read the book. Considered one of the great American novels, I finally decided I had to read it. I'm curious to see how they adapted a great novel into one of the greatest films I've ever seen.

B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I have loved Leonard Cohen since i was in high school, and I love him even more now. His music is haunting, the words are poetic and he has had the lasting power that a true artist exhibits.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another great book by Mr. Hosseini! I couldn't put the book down, was captured by every page and then felt sad when the story ended. The end left me wanting more!
B000002UC5|5.0|He is a constant surprise, continuing to explore his music way beyond The Beatles years. I admire his willingness to keep working hard, when he could retire on his billions, and do whatever he wanted to for the rest of his life.
B0091REZMW|3.0|decent graphics so far smooth. takes a while to download supposedly never ends so if that's true should be good  3/17/15 I deleted this game a while back because while it was interesting at first, after a while it becomes impossible to accomplish anything without &#34;friends&#34;  I dislike having to involve social media in games of this sort.  Also it took a huge amount of space on my device
6305428042|5.0|It brings me back to my childhood, when Halloween was one of my favorite days. It borders on the ridiculous, which is very entertaining. Bette Midler is simply fabulous, as she is want to be. She just &#34;has it,&#34; which shines through in the movie.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I loved this book! I don't know how much of it is actual truth but I do know that I wish and hope most of it is. This book like other books by Dan Brown just makes you think and takes you to a new level of intelligence even if for only a moment. Again I loved it and I think it's a definite must read.
B000002HEM|5.0|When I saw this on television, I had never heard of them before. But now I am a lifetime fan. This album is particuarly special.

B000641D2Y|4.0|It is a fine sequel to the original movie. How a British street urchin fits into this movie is rather bizarre. But still, I love Macaulay<br />Culkin, and the scene in which he is reunited with his mother is very touching.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Colors are brilliant, easy to control with a flick of your finger, and very mind challenging. The different levels allow you to play till your heart is content or until your kindle battery dies.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|These songs are filled with pain and beauty. Even more impressive when you consider that he composed them himself.<br />He has become one of my favorite singers, and this album is a true treasure.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Excellent quality and keeps the original feel<br />No problems with the disks or case and looks great in my collection!
B00BTHWFEC|5.0|I can't stop playing this album/CD, this is a great album, please enjoy these guys while their still around, it's all about the music my friends. There's a reason why they debuted at number one in fifty countries with over 150,000 sold in the U.S.the first week. This is a first for black sabbath in America, I can only imagine how thrilled these guys are at this point in their career.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Completely surprised by how emotionally invested I became in these characters. Immediately going to read her other novels!<br />Definitely recommend this sweet, funny, yet gut wrenching book.
B003B02O0U|4.0|A really engrossing story about corporate greed. It shows the lengths to which some individuals and corporations might go to satisfy their greed and need for power.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Once I finished the book, I realized how all the seemingly random characters had fit (sort of) together, but while reading, I found the jump from character to character rather disruptive.  I did enjoy the book, but...
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|Kanye, in a world where club music rules the world, continues to show up everyone by doing something completely and totally off the wall and unique.
B005LAII80|4.0|You don't even leave MegaCity; you don't even leave a block (the huge building); Urban doesn't remove the iconic helmet once, so he has to physically and verbally (and with the trademark Dredd scowl) carry the title character. Fun flick, cool 3D, convenient portability with UV digital copy.
B000PMLFRA|3.0|Nothing special from the DVD version, unless you're really into Blu-Ray quality. Also nothing in the Special Features different from the DVD.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This movie or Life of Pi should be your demo disc to show off. Of all the 3D movies of this generation, Avatar truly knows how to flex its muscles. You yearn to live in Pandora after the film.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great fun very entertaining and challenging. It really makes you think an  gives<br /><br />you a nice sense of accomplishment. I highly recommend it.
B005LAII08|4.0|3D is the way to watch this Pixar offering. Basic loner learns to work as a team formula the studio uses in all of its films, but entertaining nonetheless.
B0096MM9GG|2.0|This game is my favorite in the gaming console series, but this 2d version is really awkward to play on a tablet. It is a great price, but too hard to navigate to enjoy the flow of the game I'm used to on a Wii or Xbox. Sorry, I tried.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|My expectations in theaters was high. With repeat viewings, it's been an acquired taste. Asides from the leads (Rapace, Fassbender, Theron & Alba), the side characters are generic, but the film is visual eye candy
B009APMNB0|4.0|Got mine from Henry's in Toronto. Works very well and does exactly what it says it does. Couple of caveats. It's not a pro calibration device. If all you need is to have your photos look like they do on your monitor when you email them, post to Facebook, Instagram, etc. then this is for you. Haven't done any printing yet. Another caveat: If your'e running an older machine this takes a while to install. Leave it alone and let it. Don't be clicking the mouse. Another caveat: the registration process is too intrusive. I bought the damn thing.  Register it. You don't need to know my street address, phone number, or my dogs middle name.
B005HS4CUY|5.0|I had these on regular DVD, but the sound quality and inversion of 3D w/ the visual upgrade made me jump at the opportunity. Still the best franchise Pixar offered.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Let's be clear. This isn't a high end mic. If you're looking to experiment with audio on your new dslr then this is the way to start. Caveat. This comes with a whole whack of line that gets tangled up very easily. If anyone has come up with a solution to this please post.
B00C7JGDBW|2.0|The effects and the Witches were very good but Franco is horribly miscast as the charismatic Oz. He is not a very good actor.  Looks good. I don't recommend buying. Was worth renting.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I started watching this on the recommendation from others. I liked it much more than I thought I would! It has great characters and intriguing story lines. And the outcome of the story is not always what you would expect. If you like serial drama shows, you should give this one a try!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I didn't see the ending coming at all. It really made the book for me. This story is engaging from the first page. I really felt like I knew the Barber family. I liked them for sticking together for truly being a family. The book raises some interesting questions.
0375758992|3.0|Read for book club.<br />Interesting bookk but I had a hard time picking it up and continue to read it.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Reading this book brought the time period to a more personal level, seeing how it impacted the lives of all levels of society.  In some ways it was depressing.  I know I will read the next book in the series, but I needed a break from so much reality.
B00190KZUU|5.0|Love this movie! Well acted, great story line!! I could watch this over and over! The ending gets me every time!

B006SAR6P8|5.0|Kill Bill Vol. II is a very different film than Vol. I. This film has a completely different mood. There is more attention spent on relations between some of the characters. There is less humor here, but still plenty to keep you giggling. There is also a lot less violence here as well, yet enough to satisfy the blood thirst of some of us. The real treat here is a superb performance by David Carradine. This is his shining moment, and he deserved at least an academy award nomination for a truly wonderful and remarkable performance. There is also a segment that is pretty much the most horrifying and unsettling \\"Buried alive\\" scene possibly ever shot. Kill Bill Vol. II isn't at all an average film, on the contrary, it's a super slick and excellent Tarantino movie, but not as over the top, not as exciting, not as action packed as Vol. I. Both of these films are really better than 80% of the movies made over the past few years, and this one is good enough to make you want to see it again. There is also a very memorable performance here from Michael Parks who plays two different characters in this movie. His portrayal of the owner of a Mexican bordello is truly incredible and humorous. Neither of the films in the Kill Bill series are as good as Pulp Fiction but they come sort of close, and I have no doubt that Quentin Tarantino has yet to make his best film. He's given us 3 others since, but his true masterpeice I think is yet to come. It may be another decade or so before he does, but he is certainly going to make one eventually that may very well top Pulp Fiction and maybe with a little luck this yet to be made picture will grab a best picture Oscar. Until then we have some excellent Tarantino movies to enjoy, and Kill Bill Vol. II is certainly one of the best.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|Note: Review for ipad version. This game is AMAZING. Highly addictive. Literally just spent hours playing it. Simple entertaining fun. Great for kids and adults. Can't recommend it enough!! :)
B0017XD3OY|2.0|The problem with 'I am legend' is that it isn't sure what to do with it's self or what direction it really wants to take. The two or three flashback sequences seem to tell us very little, catch us off guard and basically ruin the flow of the movie. 'I am legend' is one of those films that looks real promising in the trailers but delivers a much less admirable experience in reality. There are some nice touches effects wise, but even these looked more promising in the trailers. Will Smith turns in a better than average performance, but somehow this movie is so uneven and dull that he seems dull at times. There are a few clever moments here and there, and some slightly creepy ones, but the whole thing seemed to end too fast. I was hoping for the grand finale that never really happens. This is a film built to feel like a big budget blockbuster, but at just about 90 minutes the final credits roll, and the whole thing seems rushed to end, and what ever the trailer led me to believe never came to light. I wasn't very impressed over all.
0920668372|1.0|I read the book to my four year old who was somewhat confused by it. I think it is possible to express love and affection, without being so literal. For example, why would you rock a grown up man, and go to his home at night. That's just odd, even by a child's standards. They could have expressed the same sentiment, by maybe a pat on the hand or hugs or kisses or something different. Oh, well. Didn't enjoy this one. Overly sentimental and emotional.
B001NLJ33K|4.0|Michael Mann scores big with this screen adaptation of the famed TV series of the same name. This version has literally no resemblance with the 80's TV classic starring Don Johnson and Phillip Michael Thomas. No over the top fashion statements are seen here either with our two main characters. What we do get is what we have come to expect from Michael Mann. Top notch, ultra stylish film making at it's absolute best. There are several action sequences that are given a refreshing new face lift. You'll find your self feeling like you finally had the chance to see some action worth remembering after years of waiting for it. The big shootout at the end echos the bank Heist shootout in 'Heat', But instead of the loud and dramatic cinematic gun battle we saw in that film, the sound and camera techniques are down played for realism, and it works extremely well. This gun battle looks and sounds almost like something we have all seen in news footage. The hypnotic and fast paced music that has become a Michael Mann signature since his early 80's crime drama- 'Thief' are all here as well and is pitch perfect through out the movie. In my opinion this is Mann's finest crime drama since 'Heat' and ranks among his best three or four films. If you like top notch action film making at it's absolute best, don't miss this one.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|What a fun story and told in a great way.  The action isn't too over the top and the softer moments aren't too mushy.  It's a great family story for sure.
B001A4LYN2|4.0|Daniel day Lewis scores another best actor Oscar and it is well deserved. Some people don't care for Lewis's over the top charismatic performances, but I do. His performances are so full of life and texture. His method of acting sort of slaps you in the face and wakes you up. He was absolutely terrifying as Bill the Butcher in 'Gangs of New York' and I have to say he is just as good here. 'There will be blood' is also rich with detail and convincingly delivers a saturated perspective on what it might have really been like to be an up and rising oil man. Seeing the hardships and trials this kind of lifestyle may have really been like. The acting is superb all around and believable. Much of the screenplay offers many of the characters simplistic dialogue because, well- this is probably the extent of how these people spoke in the late 1800's and early 1900's. And Day Lewis is so perfectly cast in this role it is almost impossible to imagine anyone else in this role. I would have prefered this film grabbed the best picture Oscar rather the 'No country for old men' which literally had no ending. This is a great and historical film.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|done with a lot of heart and soul, characters finally meeting their strides. truly well done season. Love the development of Spencer
B002ZBRSMK|4.0|David Bowie never looked better than he did in this film. And he looks simply amazing! Through the entire film he looks just stunning. Wonderful costume ideas, and just the perfect face to play this lost and frail alien character. Certainly not Bowie's first performance on film, but one of his first feature film leading roles. Nicolas Roeg had Bowie in mind for this film from the beginning. In the commentary on the disc he mentions only one other person he might have considered. It's a good thing he chose Bowie. Bowie turns the screen electric. He grasps our eye's and we are under his hypnotic influence. As science fiction goes, this is one of the oddest ones. Part art house, part pop art experiment. Sometimes beautifully haunting. Sometimes odd and comical. Sometimes a little off-beat. Several actors give perfect performances. Not Oscar caliber work here, but performances that just seem to work very nicely with the flow of the film. But no doubt, this is Bowie's day, and every scene he is present in overshadows the other actors and their performances. He is simply a beautiful and striking figure to look at, and his motion, manner, and body language all fit perfectly for his character. I think any Bowie fan should see it at least once, especially if you like the periods when he recorded Station to Station, Low, and Heroes.
1616550414|5.0|The hard cover is very quality. Not easily damaged. So are the pages. The content itself is very enjoyable for zelda fans and anyone who can appreciate ate and gaming art. There is also had a special something at the end which really took the book to a whole new level.
B0043X1FL8|4.0|Robert de Niro delivers and astonishing performance as Leonard, a man fallen victim to a rare and cruel neurological disorder that renders him in a state of suspended animation. A disorder that literally freezes him in time. This is by far (at least in my opinion)De Niro's best performance. Perhaps not my personal favorite, but an Oscar caliber performance, and his very best. Based on true events, De Niro's Leonard is kept in a special ward with other patients who appear to have the same disorder. Robin Williams (in a pitch perfect and tender performance) portrays doctor Sayer, a man who takes a genuine interest in Leonard and the other patients in a frustrating and difficult attempt to bring them out of their catatonic and lifeless states. Awakenings is both Inspiring and sadly mournful as Dr. Sayer discovers the possibility of using a drug that soon offers a miraculous hope, as well as heartbreaking realities both he and his patients must accept. A powerful story of hope and acceptance, though ultimately depressing.
148113373X|5.0|I have cherished this book, as it is an example of great Christian thinking in a time when thinking is poorly examined. Chesterton's tangents (he rarely edited his own work) are better than many other author's well thought-out arguments.<br /><br />It has been a few years since I reread this work, so that's all I have to say for this review, but I wanted to suggest it for anyone in academia who has a passion for apologetics.
B0011MZOEI|5.0|The first 'Die Hard' was simply a film that was a ground breaker for a new kind of ultra sick action film, that opened the door to many other action films to follow in it's footsteps. The second was simply not the equal of the first one, hardly very good at all. 'Die Hard with a vengeance' turned out to be a real summer blockbuster and the teaming of Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson made not only a perfect buddy team, but made for some seriously funny laughs. The first one and the third installment are simply great action films that really deliver. The newest outing, 'Live free or Die Hard' seems to be reaching for something new and man it manages to do just that. If fact it often does sometimes as convincingly or even more so than 1, or 3 did. However though the action sequences in this outing are outstanding, the trailers pretty much ruin the fun because most of the good action is already seen in the trailers. My main gripe is that the main bad guy in this one simply seems less interesting and not nearly as charismatic as the characters we saw before like the ones Jeremy Irons and Alan Rickman played. But The actors and the scripts they were given made for some really enjoyable bad guys. I found that I simply didn't care as much for this bad guy on the fourth installment. However Willis has a wonderful sidekick in this one, a sarcastic wise cracking computer hacker, and watching Willis and he play off of each other is very entertaining and often hysterical. In some ways this outing is better than 'Die hard 3', and that is indeed saying a lot. Really, 'Live free or Die hard' is not a bad movie at all, in fact it's excellent. I've now seen it about 12 times, and next to the original I'd have to say it's the next best Die Hard, and my personal favorite as far as one you want to watch again and again, even though I admit it's not as good as the original

B005DJGMQE|4.0|I am a fan of Robert Redford's directing and was not disappointed in this well told story about the search for co-conspiritors in Linclon's assasination. This was a chapter in that dark time that I had not heard about. Worth the time to watch.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Cute little movie. Not a lot of 'substance' to it, but I had low expectations based on the poor reviews critics gave it.
1469220725|1.0|Terrible ending..akin to a cliffhanger in a bad soapie. Sylvia Day obviously thinks her readers are stupid enough not to see this book is complete fluff created purely to string out the series. Well not stupid enough to buy the next one that's for certain.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|The instant video was easy to use and highly recommend purchasing videos in this manner. The series is outstanding and I look forward to season 3.
0553801503|3.0|I really found AFFC to be a burden more than anything.  It wraps up nicely (though with a series of cliffhangers and no real conclusions), but it was overburdening for much of it.  The new POV characters were a mixture of interest and dread, and a slew of very minor characters introduced were so uninteresting it made it difficult to get through.  The multitude of perspectives on the Iron Islands and Dorne keeps you guessing as to who the \\"it\\" characters really are, but I'd have preferred one character from each as the POV, which would add value as the story progresses the the reader can develop some kind of attachment with the storyline.  An abridged version could cut AFFC to less than half its size and not truly lose anything of value.
B0012GMW7A|5.0|Leonard Cohen is one of the greatest story tellers around. This album gives a wide spectrum of his capabilities. I received the auto rip immediately upon ordering. I now have it on my computer and my Kindle Fire and the CD hasn't got here yet. I love that bonus.

B00AMBK6J2|1.0|While this film advertises a talking teddy bear, it is in no way meant for young people.<br />The language and content are vulgar and it's difficult to find any redeeming qualities<br />in this work.

1780721676|5.0|I went on the FAST diet. It was easy. And in 3 weeks I lost 10 pounds! If I want to I can lose more. But I'm just going to work on my fat to muscle ratio, losing fat and gaining muscle, of course. So, I'm sticking to the FAST diet but bumping up my cardio and weight lifting. This diet is fun and easy. Now two more of my friends are on it. One of my friends is back at his High School weight. He did it less aggressive but still lost 10 pounds in the first 5 weeks, a very healthy amount. Highly recommended!
B000FCKGPC|2.0|I can't deny that Martin has crafted an incredibly rich and complex story that weaves political intrigue, unexpected plot twists, and calculated character revelations into a gripping saga that hooks you from the first book and keeps you coming back to learn what happens next. In terms of the plot, this series is great, but what prevents me from loving ASIF and this book in particular is Martin's narrative style.<br /><br />Martin has never been skimpy with his descriptions, and he does have an eye for detail that brings his scenes to life, but he goes on for far too long. We have twenty pages devoted to Sansa's coaxing Robert down from the Eyrie and fifteen to Sam's seasickness, to give just two examples. It's tempting to skim over passages like these, but then one risks missing some vital detail buried in the paragraphs. This makes for tedious reading enough, but Martin also goes overboard by writing entire chapters that bear no relevance to the overall story. What was the point of relating from start to finish the escapade in Dorne when it failed and had nothing to do with the plot twist revealed at the end? Why follow Brienne through so many encounters that went nowhere? Euron Greyjoy had almost an entire chapter devoted to minute details of his background, while several scenes involving Cersei could have been left out without issue. Martin seems to operate under the false impression that more is better and his editors can't or won't rein him in. As a result, this remarkable story gets buried under extraneous detail.<br /><br />In addition to being overwritten, the book introduces new viewpoint characters in place of Tyrion, Danaerys, and Jon Snow. Given the excesses I've already mentioned, it seems that tighter editing could have allowed Martin to include most or all of the missing characters, presuming of course that the same editing applied to them.<br /><br />I do like the tantalizing plot developments in several of the storylines and am itching to find out where they lead. I'll need to decide though, whether to bite the bullet and slog through the next books, or spare myself and just read the plot summaries online.
0553062182|3.0|This book confirmed for me what I already knew about myself. That I was an HSP. It was interesting and insightful in terms of explaining and defining the trait, but for me that's as useful as it got. It didn't give much info in terms of how to deal with it and for me that's what I was really looking for.  But that said, it was well written with lots of case studies to support what the author was saying. I guess if you think you may be an HSP and want confirmation it would be a good place to start.
B005COO1X6|3.0|This is a short story, not a novella or novel, written by Stephen King. You can very much tell it is written by King, as it is a classic King tale. The Amazon review tells you exactly what the story is about...almost completely. I love King and was really looking forward to another excellent story from him as I sat down to read. I was disappointed.<br /><br />The characters in the beginning - age 10 and 12 or 13 (he doesn't say exactly) - are well rounded, but the surely don't act their age. On the one hand, they act too young...a 10 year old too young to go ride his bike at the sandpile? Not when I was growing up! On the other hand, they act too old...a 10 year old using foul language so easily? Not in my world!<br /><br />The beginning of the story really had me going in a different direction. The whole set up was a waste of time, though well written and easy to get into, it didn't really have much to do with the story as it unfolded. It seemed like King had sat down to write one thing, got distracted and a while later sat back down and finished a different story, being too lazy to go back and make the beginning fit better.<br /><br />The horror part of it was pretty good. I did find myself a little tense, hoping they would stay away from the car...don't pick up the phone! But it was poorly ended, as if, again, King got distracted and came back and just finished it without thinking about it because his deadline had come and passed. I was VERY disappointed with the ending.<br /><br />Normally I would never give Stephen King such a low review. His work is exillerating and twisted. This one just didn't cut it. $3 was too much to pay. If he went back and actually finished the story, I might change my mind.
B00C061HZY|5.0|Definitely different from their old stuff but still enjoyable to listen to. This is an album that needs to grow on you but once you listen to it more and more you will enjoy it
B007WFR0QS|5.0|OMG!  I'm in love with this woman!  She's beautiful and writes beautiful music.  Her voice is insanely awesome!  I listen to this cd on repeat in the car and at work while I was cleaning and packing up for the summer.  Now, if only I could meet her I'd be set!
B006MW3V6U|4.0|I have only seen the first episode; however, based on last years season, it should be interesting. Hope to watch more soon.
B008G12ERC|5.0|Muse have done it again. &#34;The 2nd Law&#34; is a fantastic record that is worth every penny I paid for it. In fact, it's so good that I even purchased tickets to see them in the front row, an experience like no other, in my hometown on the corresponding world tour. MovieMars did an amazing job shipping and delivering my product. I hope that the band can keep making brilliant albums such as this in the future, because if they can, they know who's money they're getting!
B002CPD5LC|5.0|Great gift for jazz and pop lovers . Outstanding performces from some of the greatest jazz, pop, and internationally renown artists
B008H6GH8I|5.0|Good movie that just adds to the RE Universe.  I enjoyed seeing Ada Wong in action again.  I hope they bring more of the enemies to the big screen.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very cool game. Just hard enough to be a challenge! Love it! And you can't beat the price at .99!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This app is great! Sound quality, variety, volume settings, preset timer. It has it all. Best white noise app I've ever used. Love it! :)
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|How do you expect to get reviews if I have to enter all the information you require?  Too much is being requested.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of the best books I have  ever read in my life!!!!!!!<br />Can't wait to read the other two.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|How do you expect to get reviews if I have to enter all the information you require?  Too much is being requested.<br />Sub par when compared with his prior works.
B009BJATYS|5.0|Pretty faithful to the book, and Romola Garai does a great job playing Emma, showing her evolution from naive meddler to caring adult. Johnny Lee Miller also fleshes out the character of Mr. Knightly really well.
0345803507|5.0|I didn't order it from Amazon but the trilogy is amazing! I've read all of the three book in less than 1 month and I was a bit busy. But buy it& you'll fall in love with it!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|A little draggy in the middle episodes, but finished with a bang and the two most annoying characters of the series are dealt with well.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It's pretty awesome it has a lot of features and the diming is nice it's like a bedside clock to check what time it is
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Will Robie is a Great and Exciting Character!<br /><br />I look forward to more escapism with this character in future books.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|FUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNN!!!!! :D This app keeps me entertained every time I play it! The puzzles are awesome! You really have to think, which this world really needs to try sometimes, to move on to the next level, EVERYBODY BUY IT!!!!!!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I can't wait to get my additional coins, LOVE this game.  My brother told me about t it.  I am telling all of my friends about.  Can't put it down.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Great game play it all the time and can not stop playing. Be careful it is highly addictive. Fun to play though.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love this app so much I called it awesome and I don't call a lot of things AWESOME except me but you know you should check this app out and its free!!!!!&gt;3
B002RXZF6C|5.0|Nothing like it before or since with singular performances by Colin Clive and Boris Karloff and a great supporting cast with James Whale's perfect direction.
B00DE0RQM8|5.0|I am loving this song!  Britney makes music that is not only catchy but clever and timeless. I am going to see the Smurfs 2 movie JUST because this song is featured.
B006OFN0SE|5.0|The dvd arrived in great condition and interesting to watch a well known public figure behind the persona presented to the public in a intimate setting .<br />Thank you,<br />Native Rose
B004YCKJSS|4.0|Very entertaining.  This was a funny movie, Rosie was great and Natalie Portman stold the show.  Thankfully there was no special, deep inner meaning to the movie, so you could just sit and enjoy.
B00BEXB18M|2.0|I have many albums by Megadeth including the first 3 and Rust In Peace, after Rust In Peace they kinda sucked for a while and were hit and miss. The last three albums were actually really good and I was excited that Dave had acquired Chris Broderick for his outstanding guitar talent(love Jag Panzer) but Supercollider isn't even close. Most of the songs lack the traditional Megadeth heavy, intricate rythyms of the past, to me most of the songs sound like hair rock from the 80's but not as good. The singing sounds uninspired and the lyrics seem trite and cliched and there are no real epic guitar solo battles like you might expect, a few good riffs here and there but not much. Just for reference, I am a metal guitarist myself and I am over 50 years old, I had expected much more intensity out of this album but I am sadly disappointed, Dave Mustaine just sounds old and tired on this one.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was really excited for this book to come out. I preordered it and was beyond disappointed with the whole book. I will not be buying the next one of the series (although I thought this WAS the last one)! HUGE disappointment! Also, I felt like it was the same thing said over and over again. It became really redundant!
B001S86J1C|5.0|This is a very good product. Answered my expectations. I recommend to everyone who want to buy something like this.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is wonderful it makes your brain think.  The only down side is that there is a minimum of levels.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|This is a very good product. Answered my expectations. I recommend to everyone who want to buy something like this.
B00BPA2PBG|3.0|This must be a movie you get to give as a gag gift. The only reason i gave it a 3 star is because i love Ghostbusters. If you have read my other reviews you see i try hard not to give bad reviews and try to give the very best honest review i can. I just can't with this. The picture was so grainy and not much change in the coloring. It was so bad i broke out my dvd i bought 8 years ago to compare it to and the 8 year old dvd had this beat. This is just a waste of $ and they should be ashamed to release something this low quality. Very disappointing!!
B00004WNZ3|5.0|This is a very good product. Answered my expectations. I recommend to everyone who want to buy something like this.
B002RI9MWA|4.0|A gripping novel that puts a different perspective on the meaning of being a fundamentalist.<br />Narrated in an unusual manner that gives a mysterious feel to the novel.
B00756GKBA|4.0|This is a very good product. Answered my expectations. I recommend to everyone who want to buy something like this.
B005AKFXZW|3.0|Highly descriptive novel.  Magic in the circus is brought to life.  Would have enjoyed more characters with substance.<br />They, like the magic described, were often shadowy figures who lived only through their roles in the circus.<br />The ending was a let down.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|The fourth season has it all; comedy, action, mystery, and wonderful character interaction-- a must see for any fan of a complex mystery--comedy--drama series
B004IPPINW|4.0|I was a little puzzled at the way it was written (while reading it) but when done I realized how much I liked it.  It stayed with me for many days and made me look at our country quite differently.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|good time passing game. levels are not so difficult that you can't figure out the solutions. can't wait for new levels.
B00AEFYW64|5.0|Good cast, good story, well photographed.  Shows Mark Harmon before he was Gibbs. And I have yet to see a movie with Sean Connery that wasn't worth watching.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|You can chose what you want to focus on, or do it all. Then you have a video to show how to do it and the count down clock. Very nice.<br /><br />The end of excuses to workout is close.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|What can I say? Fantastic show....keep it coming. Can't wait for next season to come on. Love how the clothing, sets, etc., change with the times.
B00C7JGDBW|4.0|I wanted to hate this movie. Not that I'm in love with the \\"original\\" (Judy Garland and company) or even all that enamored of the whole Oz concept.<br /><br />I watched it with the same attitude as when I sat down to watch \\"Battleship\\". I knew it wouldn't be exactly my cup of tea, but was certain to have a considerable amount of spectacle and flash and I would be happy with that. (By the way, \\"Battleship\\" delivered exactly what I expected, no more, no less and if you like explosive combat scenes, it's fully satisfying).<br /><br />But this one... I expected to have to wade through a lot of stuff about the characters and plot exposition (and I most certainly did), but once we arrive in Oz... it got me. It was like one of the flying monkeys reached into my chest and pulled out my heart... slowly... while grinning.<br /><br />It was funny, exciting, had a few lovely twists to the story and the China Girl absolutely broke my heart. By the time the Wizard did his final show and won the day, I was on board, laughing and cheering (which was a little unnerving as I was sitting alone in my apartment at the time).<br /><br />So don't go into this one expecting a seamless mesh with the Judy Garland classic. Just let go of your preconceptions and enjoy the ride. In fact, I'm going home and watch it again. I need a good cry and a great laugh... and maybe a cheer or two.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Complex and engaging. Couldn't wait for the next page . The character development and the on the ground research was a large part of our round table discussion.
1401324649|5.0|a surprisingly funny book about the adventures of this man following him from youth through  to today.  I liked it.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Southern life in the era of slavery and class distinction was illuminating. As much as we think we know about the topic, Grissom gives a voice to her characters.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a good, easy to play game and Heaven knows the price is right!  Graphics are nice and clear, and it responds well on my Kindle.
0783225199|4.0|Good quality movie. I enjoyed popping in the tape it brought back alot of memories. Raw hide raw hide lol
B00C7JFIRC|3.0|I read the reviews before I bought this package, and I think it was wishful thinking that made me hit the order button.  I wish I had gotten it as a rental, and now I own a boring, lackluster story that I can't show my 7 year old because the monkeys are too scary.  Live and learn.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Absolutely amazing, get it ASAP. best game I ever played. I love it the best game in the world. Awesome.
B0054U56B4|5.0|Really liked this story.  The whole Lena thinking she's going Dark was an interesting take.  I also liked the introduction of the John Breed character.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Amazing!!!! What more can I say? Hans Zimmer does it again and truly captures the new Man Of Steel perfectly
B00C7O8MJ8|5.0|Loved it!!!!  Brings back the excitement and drama of the movie.  Like the redone Star Trek theme.  I hope they keep the same composer for any other Star Trek reboot movies.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was a easy but fun read for those who just want a good, romantic read. It  keeps you reading; I had trouble putting it down so, yes, I'm behind on my laundry. I highly recommend it for a good summer read.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Interesting take on a society protected from the force that rules the rest of the planet.  Thor is a little too lucky.  I mean really always falling into situations he resoundly comes out of.  Would be nice to see him succeed not so well once in awhile.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not to hard fairly easy to be honest if you have decent problem solving skills<br />It could have more steps to get certain parts of the rooms puzzle completed
B00BDAP66E|4.0|I always wished this worked a little better, but it works ok on the kindle. I want it to be faster and separate the notifications.
B002R88G5E|5.0|Very well written book. Provides insights into an environment that we never live in. The heart ache is at times overwhelming.
B00BQ1DBUS|3.0|What can I say? He's a crooner, not Frank or Tony but easy listening. He's a Brit too so he can't be that bad..
B00AKO93JK|5.0|I don't see the problem customizing the workouts, just pick one and watch/and/do. The videos are clearly shown for an exercise and the muscle groups in the startup quickly take you to the workout you want to for that muscle group. Stable and scales well on my Samsung Galaxy SII.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|Seriously, what decent human being likes this type of obscene, illiterant (c)rap? It's not music, just a simple minded nut case chanting nothing but thrash mouth words. Doesn't deserve a rating at all!
B00AKO93JK|3.0|I like this app. Two small issues though: no beat to time the reps during workout, and it crashes on kindle fire HD sometimes.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|pretty good app. i like horses and this fits right in. I think we all wish that the horses could be bought with coins instead of gems though.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I love Mitch Albom's books. He books are thought provoking and always gives me things to think about! It was great!
B008BU75IQ|1.0|Very dissatisfied .  It makes you wonder if he is just churning books.  If this was your first Jeffrey Archer book you wouldn't buy another.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I'm unable to bring it up on my kindle h.d. So right now i'm very displeased with it. i've tried about 6-8 times and to no avai.
B005OYKI1I|5.0|A very good story and full seating on the edge of your seat of excitement and fast paced action story
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this is a fun game. short but fun. cant wait for the other levels. I did get stumped but not enough to turn off the game.
B001QB9H10|5.0|A very good story and full seating on the edge of your seat of excitement and fast paced action story
B00499NHLC|5.0|Benedict Cumberbatch gives a very convincing twist to Sherlock Holms set in modern times.  A pleasant surprise that improves with each show watched.
B004LWZW6U|3.0|This movie is clearly for the fellas. Mucho T&A. If you are into lots of blood and classic cheesy horror, this movie is for you.<br />The 3D effects are awesome. (passive 3D TV). The story line is a bit cheesy and comical, but the movie is not all that bad. I<br />would suggest not paying over $10.00 for this disc.
0393345408|5.0|There could not be a better way to bring out the essence of a nation's economy than with the boots on the ground approach and analysis that Sharma brings in. The book holds the reader's attention throughout and is very insightful.
0071390111|5.0|If you're looking for a book about neuroscience this is the perfect one. A great text, covering various aspects: physiology, pathophysiology and even physics so you can get the most of its content.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love this game<br />you should try it. the game keeps you interested in it. wish i had more rooms to free game
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Kept me entertained.  I can't wait for more floors. Ten are just a tease but certainly worth a download.  5 stars
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The game is interesting but the clues are sometimes very easy. I enjoyed playing the game while it lasted. it took me just a few hours to finish. I wish it was a longer game. the game is good though.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Good but lose fb. I compare all of these games to the old city building games when I was a kid. Good but not as good as those.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great character study!  It gives you a look at the history and style of the period while entertaining all of us.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|If you liked The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns than you will absolutely love this book! It grabs your attention on the first page and keeps it until the last page. It takes place in Afghanistan, France and The United States. Hosseini is a master story teller and is able to weave the lives of his characters, and the choices they have to make into the struggles of living in poverty and a worn torn country.  You like his characters, both their strengths and flaws. Don't let the summer end without reading this book!
B00BZW5W3W|5.0|Im a huge fan of Maysa and even though i thought Motions Of Love was her best project, this one has to be runner up.<br />Favorite tracks:<br />Be There<br />Good Morning Sunrise<br />Quiet Fire<br />Love Me Good<br />But all tracks are fire
B00BHMETKC|3.0|I,m not sure it would have been my vote for best picture, but it was enjoyable especially since it had a basis in truth and history.
0385349947|5.0|This book should be read by not only women, but men as well. Usble when you need some direction to pay it forward or when you are on the fench about moving forward.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|I guess I had high hopes after all the academy award nods.  Granted my family has the horrible habit of talking through the exposition, and there are several moments when catching the details of dialogue is very important to this movie.  It made me want to read the book in the hopes that I could follow the ending better.  The ending left me convinced I missed something, and I usually don't have that problem.  I usually get it when others don't.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Awesome. Can't wait to read the third book. Couldn't put the book down. I recommend you to get this book.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|It followed some predictable choices, and left some that were more interesting untouched for the sake of feminism.  So more didactic than good storytelling.  Still, some of the animation was outstanding.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I followed the directions. I barely got my case wet. it destroyed my phone. I called the company because I had done the lifetime warranty thing, and they informed me they will not cover the phone. Mind you the warranty program makes it sound like the warranty is meant to cover the case AND phone. I feel scammed by the company. Mine was a legitimate lifeproof case, not a generic.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|not too hard - not too easy~ just right<br />It is clever and interesting. if it had a plot it would be brilliant.
B005HJWWW8|3.0|Admittedly for the price it's not too bad, however, I still expected it to amplify the sound more then  it does,.  In my opinion it's overall not really worth almost 30 bucks for the very slight increase in sound that it gives.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|awesome game!! kind of like a nancy drew mystery game. though it would have been nice for it to be longer and more going on but still an awesome game
B004L8BL64|4.0|We enjoyed the movie and Nicholas Cage's character. While it was clear something magical was going to happen, we were pleasantly surprised and entertained by the movie's outcome.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I love the book. I think it is better then the HBO series. Going to get the second one now.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|We have played for hours and spent 65 dollars on perks, algae, sand dollar's. Kid loves game now lost in loop l what a pain.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I did my first whole 30 and lost 25 pounds, felt amazing and had so much energy. I went back to eating the un whole way and i feel horrible again gained the weight back so i am starting my second whole 30 tomorrow. cant wait!
B007ZXK08C|5.0|As a newcomer to author Gillian Flynn, I was captivated from the first sentence. Couldn't put it down. Can't wait to read her other books now.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Loved this book.  Was one of the best in the series.  A must read for any Jordan fan. by Doug
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My 11yr old son and I had lots of fun trying to escape each room. Awesome game! Can't wait for more rooms. App worked great with no problems at all. Definitely recommend!!!
0803731094|5.0|I bought this book to keep at home for when the grandkids spend the night.  I little 5yr old grandson loved the book.  He loves to be read to and he knows all of the old books, so I thought I would try something new.  Very happy with the book purchase.
B0092S4WLY|1.0|... Diamond friendly rainbow of poop the daily news blogs with in the crab troll f is a double the suitcases in a sun dragon in dragonvale to make an epic proportions and
B009NY43NY|5.0|Great ending to her series. A few loose ends, but none that were really bothersome. Overall, enough action to be satisfying, and good storyline
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is an easy brain teaser that is just hard enough. Once I realized that some rooms have multiple angles of view, I finished 10 levels in an evening.
0062231375|5.0|He is an excellent writer.  Those of us who have worked in the restaurant industry feel we have a spokesperson who elevates the grittiness, drama and intensity to literature.  Those of us who have never worked in the restaurant industry will be enthralled and more than a little surprised.
0446554995|4.0|One of the better Pendergast stories. I was getting a bit tired of him but this one re-kindled my interest. It's no cabinet of curiosities but its is pretty good.
0802473156|5.0|All my life I have loved getting gifts and have been made to feel ashamed or guilty for that as I was told \\"you can't put a price on love\\". This book is a wonderful read because it explains the five different communication styles of love and helps those of us with different communication styles understand each other. We all have different ways to show and recieve love and mine isn't greedy, needy or monetarily based -- thus nothing to be ashamed of. I'm very happy that Dr. Chapman has given me the authority (through this book) to ask for and receive love the way I understand it. Thank you for such an insightful and comprehensive explaination!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this series.  Full of surprises.  The characters behave like real people.  Great writing.  Wonderful acting by all of the cast.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Own it on DVD and now I own it on Blue Ray! :) pretty stoked, and it had added features I haven't seen before
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Best series ever, anywhere.  Season 3 brings unforeseen events to Downton.  However I recommend Season 3 and look forward to Season 4.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Another one to add to the lord of the rings collection! ill be buying the next 2 as well, for those who haven't seen it - and enjoyed the others - you'll love this one as well.
B006N9XHLQ|5.0|Beautiful beautiful prose. I could read Josh Lanyon until the end time. Finally, Adrien and Jake see what's always been right in front of them. If this is the end of the series, then I am a deliriously happy reader.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I lost my power cord right before vacation time so I ordered it off of Amazon, received it within just a few days and it works great. I was very relieved to get it so fast so that I could use my Kindle while out of town.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is so much fun, good graphics and controls. A definite download. Great for people of all ages, especially with the different vehicles and stages get the moon and the monster truck and you will get so many coins!!! Have fun :)
B000JQUHLM|4.0|The book was easy to read. A good book to read to unwind or past the time with. A book you could put down and pick up to start reading again without having to go back & reread to get back into the story.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great game....love that it is free!!!! Works well on my HTC One.  I LOVE IT!! Super fun....kind of addicting. That's all!!
0930289234|5.0|This is one of the first graphic novels I ever read and I absolutely loved it. The art is fantastic and the political themes when intertwined with the characters lives and the 'novel within a novel' aspect were thrilling.
0439813786|5.0|It will probably become a modern classic. As an author myself, I can honestly say that this book is well-written, enjoyable, detailed and, is wonderfully illustrated. Great for any child who loves the story of Hugo Cabret!
B005544TRQ|5.0|My husband and I started watching this show recommended by my father in law.  We went through season 1 which is on Prime and then saw that the current season 3 would be starting on tv in July 2013, so we wanted to see season 2 before then.  Season 2 was not on Prime so we bought it for 24.99 and now own it.  The sucky part is that 3 days later season 2 went on Prime. :(
B004J64QSI|5.0|While this is billed as a &#34;Concert Performance&#34; you will never find a more moving piece of musical theater. The cast is superb. The singing and acting capture all that has made this the most performed musical in history. Highly recommended.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|You've really gotta be careful with these kinds of apps. When I went to sign in it told me this app wants &quot;manage my account&quot; so I pressed &quot;back&quot; and words came across the screen saying DO NOT PRESS THE BACK BUTTON. Like... what. Delete. Delete. O.O
B007MNV5WU|3.0|It's a bit strange the way the Birds, Pigs and objects react in space. It takes some time to get used to the gravity fields and the behavior of the new birds. It still keeps me hooked, but not as much as the first.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This app does exactly what it says.  Easy to use opens fast and easy.  Would recommend it to all my friends.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It's the ultimate love story and in turns funny, heart -wrenching and glorious. I missed these characters so much when the book ended that after a few days of quiet mourning, I re-read it again. The dialogue is witty and wry and very honest. Great read.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|Look all over this amazon.com page, what do you see? In the \\"Customers who bought this album also bought...\\" you will see a slew of artist and genres from Techno/Industrial Daft Punk to laid back rapper Mac Miller. Then look at the reviews, you will see the \\"Kanye haters\\" , the \\"Kanye fan\\", and the \\"unbiased listeners\\". All of this should tell you that: a) Kanye is a growing, and ever progressing artist, and b) he still generates enough interest to get the haters to his page. Regardless, if you are not a fan of Kanye, then why let him provoke enough energy from you to write a review? Like a great lawyer defending a good client, Kanye defends his craft, and his genius throwing us off again (just when we accepted 808's and Heartbreaks).<br /><br />From the opening, dub-step-ish \\"On Sight\\", Kanye rips a gaping hole in traditional rap with low end frequency 808, 90-120 bpm background music and flows with his schizo-grandeur lyrics. It is hard to deny a man of talents of this sorts when he started rap on this road (check back to his collaboration with Daft Punk on \\"Stronger\\" from his 2007 Graduation album), and with many artist attempting to continue what he started...they are just sounding sickly. To be honest, for such polar ended genres like Industry and Hip-Hop to be meshed seamlessly, you need an artist who IS AN ARTIST...not just a rapper or producer. Credibility goes to this song, and I find it difficult to understand why this was not released as a single.<br /><br />Then comes \\"Black Skinhead\\", a song that is abrasive and truculent. With lyrics like \\"...if I knew what I knew in the past/ I would've been blacked out on yo' a**\\" going over a Gary Glitter-like sports beat, this song is meant to be intentionally off putting to the listener. The beat is very catchy, too! No two songs sound even remotely similar, and he chooses to rap about very different subjects on each song to keep the vibe fresh.<br /><br />I love the fact that Kanye is as confrentational and brutally honest as he is. Songs like \\"New Slaves\\" and \\"Blood on the Leaves\\" leaves Mr. West without a truth filter. As many rappers claim to be real, but yet rap about girls and money...Kanye is on target with his sarcasm of the Government, himself, and other people.  He just tells it like it is, and like the old saying goes: \\"The truth hurts!\\".  Cynicism about glamor and glitz that he chases in \\"New Slaves\\" gives you a glimpse into his inner conflict. Every human suffers conflicted emotions and competing interest...but from this album and its content, I get the feeling that Kanye may be a borderline schizo who constantly argues with himself. This is the reason he can put out such an experimental album such as this and continue to collaberate with/produce for other artist without influencing them with this flavor. This album is really, and genuinely unlike ALL of the songs you hear on the radio, and to be honest I personally dont think this album is \\"radio friendly (formulated and contrived)\\" which is why I fell for it the second listen.<br /><br />If you like experimental, off-the-radar music then you wont be let down by a perfectionist who made an experimental album. I do have the faint feeling that this will be Kanye's equivalent to The Beach Boy's \\"Pet Sounds; hated now, classic later.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />This album definitely does grow on you, as do the subtle messages he gives you!<br /><br />After several(hundred) listens...I cannot help but to get the underpinning of Kanye's rebellion against Jay-Z. I am putting all of the pieces together...the coment he said about \\"Suit & Tie\\" while in concert, the \\"Big Brother\\" song from Graduation, and not the Performance of \\"New Slaves on SNL. A lot of the subtleties are saying \\"My soul is NOT for sale, regardless of what I dress in\\". He even uses Billie Holiday's \\"Strange Fruit\\" as a sample for blood on the leaves...this dude is deep. We all know that Billie was not talking about apples hanging from the tree in hertime, which makes me ponder why he used a strong sample as this, and at this particular time on this album.<br /><br />Rebellion against dumbed down mainstream and Jay-Z  are not easy tasks to perform, but I understand Ye given his history with Jay, and his history of how media dragged him down at every turn they could . \\"Hold My liquor\\" is one of those songs where you catch lines here and there, and he meant it that way with the background music going near silent, or dropping when he has something to say. A line like \\"...since those skinny jeans, they aint never liked you\\", and \\"Everybody know that you brought real rap back\\"...those shots are directed at someone!<br /><br />\\"Guilt Trip\\", \\"Send it up\\", and \\"Bound 2\\" are excellent tracks that build great momentum in sequence, with \\"Bound 2\\" teasing the listener of what a Ye album would sound like without his new direction. He reverted back to the likes of \\"Late\\" on Late Registration with the sampling and old school flow.<br /><br />Stand out tracks are:<br />On Sight (originality at its best)<br />Im in it<br />I am a God<br />Hold my liquor<br />Blood on the leaves<br /><br />I can also understand how the critics praise this album in black and white, on paper...but anyone with a voice in radio (which is all one mega channel pushing Jay-Z down our throats) would spew hatred on Ye...knowing that Jay is going to drop an album that will starkly resemble Ye's production and sometimes even his out-of-genre guest (remember the Chris Martin dilemma?). In that case, these DJ's should check out J.Cole's album where he blatantly states that he \\"Let Nas Down\\" by following Jay's direction, and later in the Born Sinner album, Cole goes off on some \\"Soul not for sale\\" tangent also. Anyone seeing a pattern here? Why are these dudes who are so associated with Def Jam/ Roc-A-Fella fighting for their souls...and rebelling at this point? I dont buy into conspiracies, but I do think they saw something they wish they could \\"un-see\\" andare now putting these tiny morsels of information out there until the complete picture is painted. Spilling music from the heart like these two (Ye and Cole) are doing are bound to make classics, even if they use two different vehicles to deliver them.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game, especially for the price!! I got this game for absolutely free! I compete against my wife for the high score. We have a great time with the game.
B00AYR2FOI|2.0|My star on the keaboards David Paich has allways spoken so fondly about this, but I miss energy and drive.
B001QTXM5Y|1.0|I ordered this movie knowing nothing about it, because I love Jeffrey Dean Morgan.  This is like one of those bloody teen video games like Grand Theft Auto.  Granted I am 44.  I gave this movie to my 25 year old friend, because she said she loved it.  I did not feel there was enough disclosure in the movie description.
B003K025TQ|5.0|Great variations of just about any genre. Especially the colaboration with my all time favourite Steve L.. Great record. Love it.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|not too hard and not to easy just enough to keep your interest. might be a little tough if you are Color blind.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|A classic.  My kids (6-8 y.o) loved it.  I had forgotten a lot of the movie since I was a kid, so it was entertaining for me as well.
0345529057|4.0|I should have to bought it in hard cover copy. There is nothing wrong with setup as well or so far I think.<br /><br />-- Anshul Meena
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is fun and challenging but not too hard. Will look forward to more levels. Meanwhile I will look for something similar.
B001NHNG64|5.0|This book was so good that it kept me reading every chance I got for a week. I would recommend it to anyone. The only thing that would even pose a slight annoyance would be that the point of view changes from 1st person in book one, to 3rd person in book two.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I love these games. They challenge your mind but don't make you crazy. Highly addictive game. Looking forward to more levels.
B00CO52NLI|5.0|It's a really good app ! One thing . It takes a little longer to download . This might only be on my kindle . But it takes a while to download . But other than that it's the best animal app I've ever played . ;)
B00CLZ4B4I|5.0|An awesome movie.  I love the twist on the great classic.  it is a great family movie.  Everyone will enjoy it.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|First off:  I AM NOT a Kanye superfan.  I was a bit confused after his SNL performance of the two singles from this album.<br /><br />That said, this is a fantastic record, end to end.<br /><br />It doesn't fit into a category, which is why I think some aren't loving it, but this is a genre-cracking, unbelievable album.  It's fantastic.  Part hip-hop, part EDM, part old school.<br /><br />I can hate on Kanye like anybody, but this is an extremely solid album, especially when listened to as a whole.  My only complaint is that it's a bit short, but as for quality-- it's full up.<br /><br />You can hate Kanye all you want as a person... but as a musician, this work is genius.<br /><br />Blood on the Leaves and Bound 2 are must-owns, along with I am a God, On Sight, Black Skinhead, and New Slaves.  Great album.  And no, it doesn't fit into a genre.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I'm glad to hear Rod play his good stuff once again!!  This CD is great, every song is good and I play it over and over.  If you like or love Rod, you need to get this CD.  He's back and as great as he used to be.  I highly recommend this CD by the one and only Roddy Baby.
B00D6GT5S8|5.0|Ever since I came across this band a few months back they keep impressing me with their incredible music.  I can't wait to see them live.
B009NPA3Q4|3.0|I like 2 songs on this CD so I guess I wouldn't recommend it.  Home is the best song on it.
B005COO1X6|4.0|A little too gory for me, but that's what you expect from Mr King.  Couldn't put it down, but I did skip a few pages.
B008J34466|4.0|I like this CD, not enough slow songs for me but it's Pink and she's a rocker!  I love some of the songs but not all of them.  The song with the singer from FUN is great!! (along with several others)  I recommend this CD to the Pink fans.
B0011EVSGE|5.0|its really a great old movie i love it and its really a huge classic and it has a great story line
B001XUH69Y|5.0|No CGI, explosions, or helicopters.  Just the story and performances that make this one of our favorite films.  Like a fine novel that one wishes to re-read again and again, familiarity just makes it better.  Yeah, we're the sort of nuts that recite the many lines we remember along with the sound track.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book is very well thought out it seems as if Mr. Brooks has actually lived through a Zombie War.  It is a wonderful read from many different points of view.
0316023744|5.0|From the lady of the house:  the one history she's read of WWII that brings perspective to what the people, soldiers and populace both, went through during the never-ending horror. as well as the full chronology of the war in the European and Asian theaters.  Comprehensive and satisfying, thought-provoking throughout.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I really don't have the words to explain why I disliked this movie so much.  I like smart movies that I have to pay close attention to.  This movie has a cool concept, but for me it fell flat.
B009R659L8|4.0|Mary Higgins Clark is successful because she writes good novels with great characters.  I found it to be a fast read and I liked that you had to think about who was who and how they were connected to the building story.  I don't think I ever read a book by her that I didn't enjoy.
B000FCKIFU|3.0|Interesting book, but too many purely exposition characters and strawmen.  Picked up at the end but was not exactly what I would call a page turner.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|Philippe Petit begins: \\"I started as a young self-taught wire walker, to dream of not so much conquering the universe but, as a poet, conquering beautiful stages.\\"  As film-watchers, though we initially approach Petit's wire walking as courage and athleticism, we learn very quickly that the athlete and his comrades view it first and foremost as a form of performance art.  As collaborators and friends are interviewed, it becomes plain that they were absolutely consumed with and commanded by the stunning beauty and artistry of what they were participating in.  During the Notre Dame walk, the elegiac Jean Louis Blondeau observes that it is \\"Something that's so beautiful, not only does it not hurt somebody, but gives something to somebody ... It's a dream.\\"  And Petit tells us that his world is \\"basically the world of a poet or a writer who decides to write in the sky.\\"  A bit melodramatic you might say?  The moment you see Petit perform, you learn there's nothing remotely melodramatic or deceptive about this mild-mannered yet ferocious individual; he's the real deal.  Accompanying this gorgeous film (with much vintage footage of NYC, Paris, and Sydney) is an equally gorgeous soundtrack.  The harvested music is gentle, contemplative, and transcendental, with the selection of each piece connoting painstaking consideration including (but certainly not limited to) an excerpt from Ralph Vaughan Williams' \\"Lark Ascending,\\" one of the most elegant pieces of early 20th century symphonic music ever written.<br /><br />So much frenzied planning and activity precedes the WTC walk that it's unclear what to expect once it commences.  Yet as soon as Petit takes that first step, we become enveloped in the warmth of his concentration, certainty, and intrepidness.  Set to the reassuring calmness of Erik Satie's \\"Gymnopedies,\\" the walk between the Twin Towers is at the same time spectacular and quietly elegant, monumental and humbly poetic, frightening yet tranquil.  Petit is commandingand celebratory, at the height of his prowess, and seems to be in complete peace.  The fusion of art, strength, and daring is mystifying, just as Petit wants it.  His companion Annie Allix watched from the ground below, and there's a still powerful and visible sense of exhilaration as she recalls it:  \\"It was extraordinary ... It was like he was walking on a cloud.  And there were such amazing moments ... when he lay down ...  We were thrilled by this image of Philippe lying down up above ... It was so beautiful!\\"  Collaborator Jim Moore recalls:  \\"The awe of the event and the overwhelming scale of the situation ... was magical ... profound.\\"  It's clear that each participant was affected in ways that have lasted a lifetime.  Petit would later say the towers were his throne, \\"the sun my scepter, my cape the wind.\\"  There are no moving images of the WTC walk, only still photography--a testament to the enduring power of the photograph. Petit later observed that he was initially \\"devastated\\" that there were no movie images, but that \\"now 35 years later I think it's fabulous that there is no film.\\"  The documentary's focus is on the personalities, the caper, and the artistry, not the \\"whys\\" compelling the dare.  Petit would later say that what made these walks so beautiful is that there were no whys.  As for the storyline involving Philippe's desertion of his friends as his fame grew, that appears to have involved a bit of literary license.<br /><br />Says Petit, \\"Living intensely is a magnificent way of living ... But it doesn't happen every day.  One has to fight for it.\\"  Most of us ordinary folk may not be able to follow our passions with the precise same vigor and apparent fearlessness of a Philippe Petit.  But we can certainly try to live life to the fullest, to give our personal best, to be just a little less pragmatic and a little more inspired.  Man On Wire makes you want to do that.  What more can one ask of a film.  Petit leaves us with this:  \\"Life should be lived on the edge of life.  You have to experience rebellion, to refuse to taper yourself to rules, to refuse [to deny] your own success ... to see every day, every year, every idea as a true challenge.  And then you have only to live your life on a tight rope.\\"
B00DF0POXA|5.0|Amazing album all around. Definitely got my moneys worth. Love that Daft Punk produced some songs. definitely Buy this album
B00CWY76CC|5.0|really like this type of game so this one does not dissapoint. it could use a lot more levels. I will be waiting patiently. for more.....hurry!!!!!
0307719774|5.0|i like it when people ask me questions so obviously i like this book although it is more of a journal.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I found this game, not knowing anything about it. But I couldn't put it down. I had to find the next clue, open the next door. It really does pull you in. I loved the graphics &amp; the music. I would highly recommend this game, for sure!!!
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|Devs team emailed me they updated this app at the beginning of the week and removed all IAP but until the time the latest update still is not avaible in amazon. It is too slow as in other market 5 stars for devs team and 1 star for amazon
B003LSTK8G|5.0|I am no economist. As a historian, I have been trying to understand the origins of the Great Recession. This book lays out in clear language  how Wall Street created this crisis. He roots the crisis to 1985 when the Salomon Brothers became a public corporation. The author explains thoroughly how credit default swabs (CDS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) were created by Wall Street Banks.<br /><br />The book has interesting and sad stories. A Mexican fruit picker who earned  only$14000 a year was given a mortgage of $750,000. Another story is that of a Las Vegas stripper who received loans for 5 rental properties. These stories show the greed of mortgage originators and the banks that were willing to couple them into CDOs and sell to unsuspected investors. They were also those who better on these defaulting and bought insurance from AIG FP . This book is a definite  read if you want to understand what happened to the economy. It is an easy read. I really  it in 2 days in between doing other things.
B003L77FYS|5.0|It has a great mix of comedy and suspence. Even though it is now season five of Castle these episodes are ones you can watch over and over they are always funny and fun!!! The characters are beleivable and you don't see the end of the season coming!
B00CHI5F5S|4.0|I had no expectations when I rented this movie and it was better than I thought.  Good story line.  Enjoy!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game! Best cooking game ever better than the one on Facebook. I stop playing the one on Facebook and play this one only.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|enjoyed the various levels - entertaining for smaller windows when something short is needed. seems good for a variety of ages.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We just started watching this program.  DA is a fun and gripping story.  We love the characters - especially Maggie Smith's character.  She has the best lines.
1612183956|1.0|The writing style is utterly flat. The characters one-dimentional. The protagonist - thoroughly uninteresting. This book is so unimaginative it compells your own creativity going. I noticed from the start that I had a number of theories in my mind and when I reached the end I was deflated. I wish I had known it was a sci-fi, and a dismal one at that. As I mentioned, the writing style is uninspired. The vocabulary is that of a toddler - only the rudimentary words, dry, unoriginal hyperboles, completely devoid of any wit whatsoever - in short - FLAT.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|There is more here than I expected when I first downloaded it. The window are clear, readable, informative, and uncluttered. The many other features are quickly accessible. This app is heads and shoulders above the other weather apps that I have used.
B005HGZVEM|5.0|It brought back good memories, I've played it several times, still enjoy hearing it every time!<br />Yes, if you like the music from the 60's, you'll enjoy this.
B005K17RU0|1.0|What can I say. There is too much info which is presented in a hodge podge manner. The app takes too long to retrieve data. It gets stuck in screens that seems to  freeze the application.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Fantastic new CD from Joe Walsh. The text of the titel song is brilliant!  Took a long time, but Joe's back with a new solo album. Lots of famous friends were invited to join him making the record. The result is great! Buy and Enjoy!!!!
B0084B1T8Y|4.0|Kipling was a racist. Doesn't mean he wasn't sentimental about the Edenic jungle life, another colony he invents. Certainly not as witty as his contemporary Twain who had a kinder heart.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Like I said: This is a TOP DVD DOCUMENT of a top group.<br />The only thing I can say is: GO GET IT!!<br />Enjoy.
1451648537|4.0|The book has very good quality and size. The cover is made from a horrible material... that why I don't give 5 stars
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is Such a great game, it sucks that there is not another one yet and i really hope the next one can be free
0307476464|4.0|Haruki Murakami's 1Q84 (Vintage International; 2013) is a long read. I wasn't sure the tome would pass the airport screening, and it ruined my track record of finishing a book specifically selected for my trip's duration (a four day conference in this case, with not enough breaks, apparently). True, the characters navigate two worlds, but there are only three principle subjects, and the plotlines are simultaneous.<br /><br />Never being one of those contemporary critics who insist today's reader needs shorter content, I have to say some discretion in editing would have been a good idea in this case. Part of the repetitiveness could be attributed to the Japanese/English translation, but I kept unearthing examples where our author seemed to be on a mission to prove he was accurate and consistent. That, he was. But I really don't need a continuous description of how ugly Ushikawa is with every passage in every part of the book every single time. 1Q84 is full of that.<br /><br />Despite the structural overkill, 1Q84 is still a captivating story. In fact, Murakami spins such good scenes and mood that I would have been quite satisfied if he left the fantasy elements out altogether. The symbolism would have been all the more powerful had 1Q84 remained embedded in reality, or perhaps a tad of fantasy, but not overtly supernatural.<br /><br />The title plays off Orwell's 1984, and the story is true to form to that era, even though the literary and philosophical underpinnings are more Freudian than Orwellian. A little romance, a little action, and a lot of internal characterization deliver a highly descriptive narrative you really do want to finish. Throw in some socio-religious competing forces, numerous western artistic references in an eastern setting, on top of confusing twin alter egos (who aren't as different from their counterparts as you might think) and you have a colorful novel going in a direction of which you're just never quite sure.<br />--Tom Field
B00CVCHJ6I|4.0|I thought they kept true to the DT formula, but still managed to add some new sounds. If you're a fan, I highly recommend this album.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Different story line. Not a very long game,though. I'm not sure this one was worth the money. Kind of  disappointed, in all honesty.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app.  Makes the whole screen of the Kindle a calculater.  So easy to see and very easy to use!
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|I am not too much for westerns but this one was okay.  The actors did a pretty good job but it sure was not a John Wayne movie.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Although I don't have any other You Tube app to compare it with, it does the job I purchased it to do.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|The actors were good and the visuals were great.  I liked that it stayed pretty close to the book but wished it could of stated more clearly that it is a prelude to the Wizard of Oz for those who could not figure it out.

B005HED11Y|4.0|good old fashion show; although obvious difference between new and old drama.  this is all i have to say, thanks
B00821OX98|4.0|This show is pretty well brought together glad it was produced by Spielberg.  Acting is good the atmosphere of the post invasion world is believable and Moon Bloodgood is just plain attractive.

B007F8BPOU|5.0|This is my preferred recipe book when it comes to making any sweet treat.  I was inspired to purchase it after visiting the original bakery in the city, and then realized many of the recipes in the book are the same ones they actually use.  The recipes are simple, but descriptive, allowing you to get the same taste as you can by buying something from the bakery.  I have made countless recipes out of this book, and each of them have dazzled anyone who tries the end result.  Do yourself a favor: make the banana pudding for yourself, then go to the bakery and buy a container of it to compare. You'll be very proud of yourself!  My only word of caution: when making breakfast buns or muffins, go for the large muffin pans - they are much easier to use with these recipes.

B008M4MB8K|5.0|Still the best story,acting,vision and this edition is a welcome addition to my BR collection.<br />HOLLYWOOD TAKE NOTE: This is a movie worthy of a sequel-not the dribble you've recently sunk millions into.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Most people loved the 2nd book most, but I like this one. This story reminded me of Twilight on porn.  Some phrases were verbatim straight from the Twilight series. You will either Love it or hate it, but you won't know till you read it.

B00471TLZS|5.0|I found this a very engaging movie all the way from start to end ... If a movie grabs me like this one did... then I must give it a FIVE Star rating ... only after watching this movie did I learn about the 'Curse' that follows it to this day... If you do not know what happened during the making of this movie ... Watch the movie ... then Google it and learn what most poeple don't know about it ... it is food for thought ... but, besides that it is a really good movie well worth waching over and over...What I enjoyed the most about this movie is I felt real feelings for the entire Family, I felt their love, their fear, their pain ... NOT meny movies do that to me... this one did.

There are way to many adds that can go on the screen while watching videos and the only way you can get rid of them is by paying YouTube $1.99 to have have them removed. By not paying YouTube instead of watching you video all you get to watch is a add in the middle of the screen and there isn't even a 'X' to press to get rid of the add.

Of course Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway make a good story even better with their presence.  For a movie its age, it has aged well and is still entertaining.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|As we the people look with disdain on the lack of leadership we see in our government today, this book describes how our greatest President used his extraordinary leadership skills to guide his administration and our nation through our most threatening crisis and deadliest war.

B000ICXQXS|5.0|The director is George Roy Hill, and the superstars are those 2 excellent old buddies Paul Newman and Robert Redford. This time, they play con men that methodically and with excellent resourcefulness fleece a rich mark (Robert Shaw). Their approaches are surprisingly complex (it would take every one of today's space to try to clarify them.) A lot of the enjoyable in the motion picture is checking out Hillside and his screenwriter, David S. Ward, keep the plot directly.<br /><br />The flick is arrived Chicago of the 1930s, and several of the exterior situations were filmed to this site (featuring an efficient system chance at Union Terminal). We see a huge, confused, lusty, brawling city where the big guys with the muscle are in some way constantly getting rid of to the people with the self-confidence angles. Robert Shaw never ever determines which struck god. Shaw is a high-stakes gambler that initially acquires hooked throughout a casino poker game in between New york city and Chicago on the 20th Century Limited. Newman and Redford area god, mark god and begin to manipulate your man. He never ever determines they even understand each various other, and that's part of the charm: They have to play a great deal of scenarios for your man as full strangers, as Redford casually allows drop that he understands the location of the greatest cable area in Chicago.<br /><br />The concept, Redford describes, is to enable Shaw to win big on a set equine race in order to ... however I had not been kidding when I pointed out the scheme is complexed. Paul Newman runs the cable area. Or must we claim it appears to be operated by Newman. Or, much more accurately, it seems a cable room, because the entire operation is merely a theatrical set, and everybody in the room is a star, and the \\"programs\\" from the track really are being composed by a reporter in the back space.<br /><br />The film has a good, light-fingered design to it. Hillside delicately children the 1930s with his small overestimations of styles and designs. He informs his story episodically, damaging the motion picture down in to the numerous stage of the con game. And he's extremely proficient at preserving a type of off-balance pacing; we can never rather pin Newman and Redford down. They're constantly kind of angling into scenes, making enigmatic declarations under their breath and working from the very least a step ahead of us. Hillside's visual style is oblique; rather than posting his stars in the frame and tape-recording the activity, he appears to sneak up on it. Newman and Redford virtually appear on their way to yet another motion picture. If that seems like an objection, it's not suggested as one: The style listed here is so seductive and brilliant it's hard to locate. It resembles absolutely nothing else I have actually seen by Hillside, and at times, it nearly reminds me of Jacques Tati crossed with Robert Altman.

0446580848|3.0|The plot in this latest DeMille adventure is very good, the characters are finely drawn, and we learn much about terrorists. The book continues what happened in \\"The Lion,\\" but readers can enjoy the book without having read the prior volume. It is also nice to be reintroduced to the protagonist of \\"The General's Daughter\\" who has a role here. However, I agree with reviewers who found too many John Corey's wisecracks. They are clever and funny but they are on virtually every page. Honey is good, but too much honey is not. Additionally the jokes slowed down the pace of the book.

B00CWVF2GC|4.0|I'd fairly written off the \\"gay\\" genre after sampling one too many of its nauseatingly shallow American specimens. But then comes along this very fine sequel to show us how a parsimonious script, a relaxed pace, soft lighting, and restrained performances, can combine to make for a simple but pleasing obverse to Death in Venice. I stop short of five stars only because the ending is too corny, the soundtrack too American, and someone failed to realize that Mr. Zehavi is too beautiful for tattoos.

It does play on my car CD player but several of the songs hang up.  The disks, even though they they have the Apple product design, look like they are some kind of knock off.<br /><br />Second, while there is some great music on this album, there are too many forgettable numbers.  My opinion is that this would have made a great single disc album but it's tiresome to listen to unless, perhaps, you are hitting the bong...

I like the availability of Kindle ebooks and the ease in which I can download (with one click) to my desktop and my tablet and that of my daughter. I particularly like the One-Click system which makes acquiring a new book so easy. I think the Kindle books are too expensive, though which limits my purchasing schedule.

0385349947|5.0|I did not intend to read this book when I first heard about it; it was not until I saw all the opinions about it and how much press it was getting that I decided to pick it up. Now that I have read it, I am glad that I did. I work full-time and my husband and I are thinking about having children soon. I have thought a lot about, and read several books about, advancing up the ladder (jungle gym, as Sheryl would say) as a woman. Now that we are thinking about having kids, that just adds another dimension to it. Reading Sheryl's thoughts about &#34;having it all&#34; (not possible), the guilt that women have about their life choices (It holds us back) and many other (related) issues struck a nerve with me and gave me a lot to think about. I am going to follow (or try to follow) a lot of her advice as well as be more cognizant of feeling unnecessarily guilty.<br /><br />I am ashamed to say that other, sadder, parts struck home with me as well, such as the discussion about the biases that women have against other women. I like to think that I have less bias than most, but I certainly still have some. However, I hope that by reading about it and thinking about it I will be able to recognize it and do something about it going forward.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, both to men and women. Everyone can get something out of it, even if it just the desire to help out more around the house or to be more thankful of what your spouse does for the family. But I think most people will read things that will encourage them going forward and motivate them to make changes in their work and home lives, as I did. I did not agree with all of her advice, and some of it flew in the face of other things that I read -- but I did not have to to be able to get a lot from the book.<br /><br />Finally, I want to address some of the negative reviews I read before I bought the book. After reading the book the irony of women tearing another woman down (the reviews saying she didn't work toget where she is, that she is just pretty/rich/lucky, etc.) is even more stark. I am not sure that all of the reviewers even read the book, but if they did they certainly did not take it to heart (and probably did not even try). My husband and I are by no means &#34;rich&#34; or well-connected but I do want to move up in my field and do so while being a parent. This book spoke to me on both points. I think it is sad that the points she makes about women being constantly torn down by other women were illustrated just in the Amazon reviews of a book she wrote to help other women.

B000SCHBGQ|3.0|While I must admit that this book does a good job of telling an entertaining story, it's tailored to a younger audience.  The characters are a bit over dramatic and portrayed at the extreme of their respective stereotypical spectrum of good or evil.  The author falls into some noticeable habits that can become annoying. For example the characters often seem to say things in a calm voice in times of extreme danger/stress which the other characters always interpret as being even more scary/forceful.  The author, in the second half of the book appears to be attempting to copying the plot from [[ASIN:B001I45UFC The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: The Chronicles of Narnia]] where one of the children is going to betray the other.  In conclusion, I'm glad I read it, I'm disappointed to pay 10 for a book which was probably only worth 3.  Live and learn.

B00B8M4IMK|4.0|Updated review:<br />After posting my original review, was contacted by Anker regarding my specific issues. The company offered to send a replacement directly to me, which I accepted. The replacement looks and feels exactly the same as the original item I received.<br />The mechanics of the contacts seem to be a little better on this charger. The tip and sides are not sluggish to return out.<br /><br />The device works most of the time in my car. Occasionally I have had to unplug/replug the charger for it to establish an electrical connection.<br /><br />Still wish it had an LED to show that its receiving power from the vehicle.<br /><br />Original review:<br />I have a 2005 Prius, the wife has a 2008 Sienna. In my car, I couldn't even get my phone to register that it was plugged in. Tried multiple outlets in the car with same result. In the Sienna, I had to continuously keep pressure on the charger before my wife's phone saw it was plugged in. Next problem, my wife's phone indicated it was charging via USB and not AC so it was only getting 0.5A - not enough to keep up with keeping the screen on, let alone GPS. Both of our phones are Galaxy Nexus devices.<br /><br />I suspect there were physical defects with the chargers, as the tip on the plug was very hard to move and once pressed in did not want to spring back out.<br /><br />The company did offer to replace the chargers for me, however I had already returned them.<br /><br />A LED indicator would have been helpful to show whether or not the charger was getting power from the car..
B009XIXVU6|5.0|What an awesome, complex story.  How he put this all together is absolutely amazing.  Every time, I put it down, I find myself wondering what's going to happen next.<br /><br />I did find it difficult to read on the Kindle, however, because keeping the characters' connections straight is rather challenging--much easier to turn actual pages of a book.<br /><br />Can't wait for his NEXT one!

The trigger can be locked in place to continuously take pictures or an extra long exposure in bulb mode (this is why I bought it)<br /><br />This wouldn't be as convenient as a wireless remote for self portraits.  But the wireless ones would require direct line of sight to the camera and can't easily do the bulb mode.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|First the release date get is pushed back 6 months, then she didn't even finish the series! The whole book felt like filler and barely pushed the story ahead. Either she has absolutely no idea how she wants to end the series or she's drawing it out for the money. This book was nowhere near as good as the first two. Poorly written and somehow felt rushed even though it did nothing for the storyline. You would think with all of that extra time it took for it to come out she would have done much better. So disappointed. And if she had plans to continue this series beyond the trilogy that it was supposed to be, she should have stated that before the release of this book. I would never have preordered had I known there would be a fourth book. I would have just borrowed the book from someone else. I absolutely loved the first two books in the Crossfire series, but this one just makes me think she's a terrible writer. I have never been so disappointed with a book or author before.

B008JFUPOY|5.0|From the opening scene, Monsters University gives laughs and a visual spectacle of cute and lovable characters. Pixar rarely disappoints and the bar is always set high. However, this movie managed to exceed my expectations. I expected a cute, heartwarming story with an uplifting ending, but Pixar never ceases to surprise. The story was funnier and more intelligent than I expected. The story was, of course, fun and exciting from the beginning. However, the story was unpredictable, refusing to fit into stereotypical molds by fooling you into believing the stereotype was occurring before overthrowing it with twists and turns. The story delivers constant laughs and a handful of unexpected twists that are as believable as they are unusual. Also, Pixar delivers an incredible cast of voices and beautiful animation. The visuals are stunning and the returning cast is great, with the new characters providing exceptional fun. The film is an overall joy to watch with great jokes and fun characters. The film is great fun for kids and a refreshing break from summer action blockbusters for adults. This is a great movie for all to enjoy between the rush of super-hero/ action films. I recommend this film for all ages.<br /><br />The Pixar short is fantastic, by the way. A story about an umbrella and many other inanimate objects that can move. It is a love story, and it is original and fun.<br /><br />Plot: 4.7<br />Acting and Effects: 4.7<br />Overall: 4.68

B008JFUPK8|3.0|\\"Yes, it's Superman, strange visitor from another planet, who came to Earth with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men. Superman, who can change the course of mighty rivers, bend steel in his bare hands, and who, disguised as Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper, fights a never-ending battle for truth, justice and the American way...\\" But what lead to all of this? That's the question director, Zack Snyder attempts to answer in the latest treatment of \\"the last son of Krypton,\\" Man of Steel.<br /><br />It has been 75 years since Superman first appeared in 1938's Action Comics' premier issue. Since then, the character has starred in countless comics, TV shows, and movies. Yet, with Man of Steel, Superman's sixth cinematic appearance, most of the buzz revolved around Christopher Nolan's involvement with the project. Nolan, most known as the director of the remarkable Dark Knight trilogy, teamed up with his Dark Knight series co-writer, David S. Goyer to write the screenplay for Man of Steel. Nolan and Goyer successfully revitalized the Batman franchise by making it edgy, making it smart, and taking a fresh take on a familiar story. Thus, the hopes are that they were able to do the same to DC Comic's most popular hero, Superman. Man of Steel, unfortunately, does not quite deliver the goods.<br /><br />The film opens on Krypton as the doomed planet is self-destructing after its inhabitants have mined the nutrients of its core, causing a full on apocalypse. Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and his wife Laura decide to place their newborn son, Kal-El in a capsule headed for Earth in the hopes that he will know a better life and continue a form of the Kryptonian line of people. Kal-El is, of course discovered and raised by Kansas farmers, The Kents where he is famously renamed \\"Clark.\\" Conflict arrives when Kryptonian General Zod (Michael Shannon) arrives on Earth searching for Kal-El as part of his mission to obliterate man-kind in a genocidal plot to repopulate Earth with pure Kryptonians.<br /><br />Man of Steel sets out to offer a different tone than is usually found in a Superman film. Henry Cavill's performance as the title character is far more serious, insightful, and raw than any previous Superman. Additionally, this is the most violent Superman film to date, proliferated with tragedy and destruction. Director, Snyder does offer a fresh take on the well-known origin story with a non-linear timeline that bounces back and forth through Superman's first 33 years on Earth. He also, gives audiences a lengthier glimpse at Krypton than found in previous films. The non-traditional timeline works very well, preventing the film from hitting snags as the character grows. Instead, audiences are able to see Superman earlier with a peppering of flashbacks to add context to his story. With all of this being said, the film lacks the edge and intelligence necessary to allow it to, well, soar. The opening sequence on Krypton is a welcomed change, but the planet is already experiencing so much unrest that it is hard to believe these alien people are anything but flawed and miserable. In fact, this scene introduces a sort of Brave New World motif where choice has been bred out of Krypton, and society chooses the fate of all inhabitants. The screenplay opts for simplicity over complexity, which forces the film into a brainless extended action scene for the final hour; a scene that puts the \\"never-ending\\" in the \\"never-ending battle for truth, justice, and the American way.\\" Coupled with these extended action scenes is Snyder's shooting technique. He uses a lot of shaky, hand-held camera shots, which do become strenuous at times.<br /><br />Perhaps the most major missed opportunity is the weak exploration of young Kal-El's/Clark Kent's struggles as an alien in a strange world. While Snyder does explore this, he does so in a fashion that merely glosses over the surface. Scene's involving Superman's youth are fartoo underdeveloped and border on stereotypical. Furthermore, the fun and the romance that are expected from a Superman story are in short supply in Man of Steel. Instead, this reboot attempts to ground a movie about alien superpeople living and battling on Earth in some sort of reality, which is a bit preposterous.<br /><br />The casting is certainly the film's major strength. Cavill is, of course, an excellent choice for Superman. He looks the part and has great presence on the screen. Amy Adams gives a performance as Lois Lane that veers far from her just being a silly girl getting into trouble all of the time, and Michael Shannon gives another full-tilt-crazy performance as Zod. Other familiar minor characters are also well cast including Laurance Fishburne as Perry White and Kevin Costner and Diane Lane as Ma and Pa Kent.<br /><br />All together, Man of Steel shows promise, but mostly for what is yet to come. Warner Brothers has already green-lit a sequel that will be fast-tracked to release before 2015's Justice League. Man of Steel feels like a bloated set-up piece to what promises to be a far more superior sequel. B-<br /><br />Man of Steel is rated PG-13 and has a running time of 2 hours and 28 minutes. The film was post-converted to 3-D, however there are some exciting sequences that are enhanced by the conversion. Nonetheless, 2-D is recommended and there is no stinger after the credits, so feel free to go home if you're not interested in who the 2nd assistant sound editor was.too underdeveloped and border on stereotypical. Furthermore, the fun and the romance that are expected from a Superman story are in short supply in Man of Steel. Instead, this reboot attempts to ground a movie about alien superpeople living and battling on Earth in some sort of reality, which is a bit preposterous.<br /><br />The casting is certainly the film's major strength. Cavill is, of course, an excellent choice for Superman. He looks the part and has great presence on the screen. Amy Adams gives a performance as Lois Lane that veers far from her just being a silly girl getting into trouble all of the time, and Michael Shannon gives another full-tilt-crazy performance as Zod. Other familiar minor characters are also well cast including Laurance Fishburne as Perry White and Kevin Costner and Diane Lane as Ma and Pa Kent.<br /><br />All together, Man of Steel shows promise, but mostly for what is yet to come. Warner Brothers has already green-lit a sequel that will be fast-tracked to release before 2015's Justice League. Man of Steel feels like a bloated set-up piece to what promises to be a far more superior sequel. B-<br /><br />Man of Steel is rated PG-13 and has a running time of 2 hours and 28 minutes. The film was post-converted to 3-D, however there are some exciting sequences that are enhanced by the conversion. Nonetheless, 2-D is recommended and there is no stinger after the credits, so feel free to go home if you're not interested in who the 2nd assistant sound editor was.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|Enjoyed the marriage of 'a little of the old with a lot of the new '.  Would have put a penny on a bet that Tim Burton had something to do with this project ... his influence abounds ! Nice work.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was so good lots of thinking  memory testing fun.  I c as n . Do this all day and never tire very much recommend.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I was channel surfing one day, I saw a woman singing and she sounded good so I put down the remote. The song was \\"My Kind of Love\\" - so beautiful. I searched Emeli Sande on my Kindle Fire HD, listened to the samples and decided I did not want just the digital music, I had to have her CD. It was an added bonus that the CD included AutoRip; I got the MP3 version free:) I listen to the songs so much, I'm hearing the lyrics in my head sometimes - I'm okay with that. Powerful voice, powerful lyrics. Emeli is a gifted recording artist and songwriter.
B00000JY1X|2.0|i respect all the other 4 and 5 star reviews but i certainly don't understand them.  thankfully i bought a cheap, used version of this box set -- and i definitely won't buy the vinyl version as i had planned to.  after the first listen, it seemed there was barely enough quality material out of the 69 songs to make one great, regular-length album.  too much filler.
0307744434|5.0|The author of this book has the gift to make you see and feel the story - very similar to the way Memoirs of a Geisha was able to float in my imagination. I could not wait to pick this up when I got home from work and regretted having to take time away from the story line so I could sleep. Amazing read - strongly recommend it.

B006BAEQB2|4.0|The first thing I want to start off with is that Philippa Gregory writes historical fiction, not history books.  Where as I have found most of her books very accurate, I feel that a person should remember that before any discussion actually ensues. I am a big fan of her works, I think they are interesting and usually keep to the facts while telling a good story.<br /> I found this to be a very enjoyable read, a vacation from the heavier history books written about this time.  Also, this was my favorite of Gregory's Cousin's War series so far.  I adore this time period, and the following Tudor reigns as well. The stories of the princes in the tower, and Richard the Third himself have always held a fascination to me- I am also a member of the American branch of the Richard the Third Society! I found that I really enjoyed the perspective of the story being told from Anne's eyes.  It was interesting to see how she, the younger of Warwick's daughters, was handled through her life.  I felt this was a very believable character.<br /> And the author did a very good job of handling the princes in the tower.  It has to be a very challenging story to tell without any proof of who actually did kill the princes.  I liked the way she handled it, including the self-doubt and confusion at the whole situation.  A very good read.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys history.  This could even be considered a decent way to whet an appetite to a very complex but interesting time period.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is an AWESOME movie!!!!! If you are a parent, especially one who has &#34;boys&#34;, you need to see this film. This video emphasizes what is really important in the lives of families and how families deal with tragedies and with blessings. A MUST SEE video for ALL MEN, regardless if you are married or not or have a family or not!!!!!  A REAL CHARACTER BUILDER !!!!!!!! Alex Kendrick does an excellent job as the &#34;leading man&#34; in the movie. His supporting cast is AWESOME!!!!! GET THIS VIDEO!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Title says it all. I really enjoyed this book. I would write more but i really want to read the next one!
B009NY43NY|5.0|I think Ms.Harris needs better editors.... but with that said, I believe this was the most logical and appropriate ending for this incredibly wild, supernaturally charged, action packed, emotionally fueled series. Ms.Harris ended this story and did our independent heroine justice. Though sad it's now over, I am happy knowing justice and happiness have been served to Bon Temps.  I will enjoy re-reading the series when I miss the characters!
B006MW3V6U|3.0|Pretty interesting beginning and then it became almost  silly. However, the story was good once you could get past the acting.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I Love the premise of behind the scenes of building a broadway &#34;Smash&#34;. Katherine Magee is a fantastic singer. I love seeing Ann Harada as the Stage Manager, sorry her role is limited. I was sorry to hear that the continuing season was canceled.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I really enjoyed the first season of this show. I expected it to be like lawyer shows of the past but it was not. The characters were real especially Lewis. He reminded me of an annoying classmate in grade school. The Jessica character was powerful without having to be &#34;in your face&#34;. I can't wait to see season 2.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey was already someone I looked up to, but reading this book proved that she is more than a talented writer, she's just like the rest of us. I laughed out loud so many times while reading this and I appreciate her work even more.
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|I thought the videography was good. I enjoyed the variety of scenes and setups. The idea of a \\"500 year story\\" is definitely intriguing. I don't think there was any issue with that aspect on the face of it, the movie itself was just boring. Boring boring boring. Did I mention Boring? Maybe it was the difficulty in picking just the right elements to put on the screen from an epic spanning 500 years... Maybe it was the actors who just seemed to be walking through their parts. Maybe it was the constant jumping around from one scene to another with very little continuity between them. The story / movie itself is apparently meant to be revealed in little successive revelations building to a crescendo at the end. For me the crescendo was when they rolled the credits. I think you could safely skip this one and not feel like you missed much.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Jack Reacher has done it again!  His sense of fairness and right/wrong take the stage.  Swift action scenes keep the reader going back for more.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Two days later and I'm still mopping my face with a hand towel --- kleenex being absurdly ineffective against the proverbial ocean of tears. My only comfort is the belief that this story will continue -- the stage is set. In the back of my mind I hear old Mrs. Hempstock's bark of laughter as she paraphrases Heraclitus --- &#34; Nothing's ever the same. Be it a second later or a hundred years&#34; --- and while I know this to be true in one sense, in the unchanging landscape of inviolate loves ( of nature, children, and pawed companions ), there is a place for cherished stories such as this.
B000YJ54DU|5.0|Love the Jack Reacher series!  Once I start a book I can hardly put it down.  This author knows how to keep your attention.
B001IFZL50|5.0|Not much more to say about Generation Kill that hasn't been said already. Its acting is excellent, its writing is great, and if you like military shows, you'll love it. Generation Kill does a great job of blending action and down time to create a very realistic experience that deserves to be seen.
B007NZDES0|5.0|We saw her show in Chicago, video is like being back at her concert. Being a live recording all that was missing was the fans around you.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|I guess you could argue that this is a tree-hugger movie, but I just watched it for entertainment without trying to ascertain if it had an \\"agenda\\".  With that in mind, I adored this movie.  It was funny, the kiddo I was with was highly entertained, and the kid in me was also highly entertained.  I had avoided this movie thinking it had nothing to offer, and maybe it was due to low expectations, but it greatly surpassed what I thought it would be.  I think it has a good overall message, even if it does cross over into a anti-corporation rant at times.  I can live with it though, if it helps teach kids to appreciate nature and the world around them.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I'm only on level 4 and its not intensely challenging but I like it alot! Worth playing for sure! -escape fan

B005HJAOLY|5.0|Whether it's a foreword, an afterword, a short story, novella - one of his amazing novels, or I suspect even a shopping list, Stephen King's voice stands alone in the literary world. Mile 81 has you on the edge of your seat half the time, and the rest of the time, you're on the floor, not knowing how you got there. You always feel a bit nervous when some of his key characters are kids - think Insomnia, It, Needful Things, Hearts In Atlantis, just off the top of my head. You hope they'll come through okay. Sometimes they don't. There are kids in this short story. Pray for them.

B0086449YA|5.0|This recording is a grower.  I presume that most people buying it are familiar with either Dire Straits or Mark's solo work.  If you are a fan of well recorded music, give this a try.  Please, do not compress this into MP3 or iTunes files.  The sonics are incredible and deserve to be heard without compromise.  If you must load it into iTunes, use either WAV or Lossless ripping options.  Better yet, just listen to the vinyl if you have the means.  Highly recommended.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I found it more disjointed than his first two, a little harder to keep people sorted, especially with unfamiliar names.  I'd have given 5 stars to each of his first two books.
1439156816|5.0|This is a great book giving a peak into the writing method of a top bestselling author.  King is straightforward and walks the reader through his method of writing - how he does what he does - in some detail.  He makes it look deceptively easy.  In suspect his method is more suited for the experienced successful published author than for someone trying to break in to publishing.  His tale of what happened to him in his accident and recovery is a great read in and of itself -possibly some of his best stuff.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|This is as bad as it gets. If this is rap, then Nas is right: hip-hop is dead. I wish I could give it zero stars.
B005FITIIC|4.0|Very good movie.  Has a great cast, is well written and well acted.  This movie is dialog driven and takes place mostly in an office building over the course of one day and night.  It sheds light from one perspective on what happens on Wall Street. Insightful.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Fun, not frustrating. Leaves you wanting more! Never knew that I enjoyed puzzle games. Very satisfying to watch the box open, bit by bit.
B004GJDQT8|2.0|after I bought some new t.v. series online, I went on Amazon Mobile, which I had downloaded on my phone, to watch it on the go. after some fiddling around, I couldn't find it on there. the only things that showed up were my wish list items. not a thing from my previously bought things. not.a.thing. its cool that I can buy stuff on the go, but how can I enjoy my Sherlock when I'm on the run when I cant even do it? I advise that fixing this, or HOW I can fix it would work. this would be much appreciated. thank you.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|This was just a really good read. The narrator has Aspergers or something similar, and this makes for a very wry take on the world. And Rosie is a treat. Just read and enjoy.
0812550706|4.0|I enjoyed this science fiction novel because of its good plot.  The writing isn't great and some of the futuristic premises are off-base, but these are easy to look past and they do not interfere with the very entertaining story.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I absolutely LOVE facebook! I love being able to connect with people you wouldn't normally talk to from years past. I don't like some of the updates. Overall....love it!
0393327345|2.0|Frankly speaking, the movie was better.  The movie contains 90% of the scenes and it actually makes more sense.  Plus, the visuals in the movie add a lot to the mood, and overall it's more suspenseful than the book.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Ok this review might be a little biased. I have read every Vince Flynn novel and loved all of them.  My first one was Memorial Day, then Separation of Power, and Transfer of Power.  This book was definitely a good one.  I always recommend Vince Flynn books to my friends and family.  My sister just started reading his books, and she liked it too.  The main character Mitch Rapp is a terrorist butt kicking, secret CIA spy, Bad A--!!  The whole series are my favorite books by far.  ​
0307474275|4.0|I enjoyed this thriller which is more of a screenplay for a Hollywood movie than a novel.  The premise is that Da Vinci and other renaissance artists hid clues to a dangerous secret in their art.  The story involves the two main characters trying to unravel that secret while being chased by the French police and by a sect of the Roman Catholic church.  It was quite interesting to view some of the art work mentioned in the book and see the hidden clues for myself.  Unfortunately, the author has a few too many plot twists at the end which stretched the imagination too far.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I make a point to read a book before watching the movie version - this book was no exception!  Well written and kept my interest.  It also gave me new perspective on mental health and the people it affects.
0452273331|5.0|Ayn Rand really draws sharp contrasts between her individualists like Roark and collectivists like Keating.  This is a timeless classic.  The Fountainhead may have Rand's best villain in Toohey.
B002RI9MWA|5.0|This was unlike any book i have read, it was enthralling and exciting, and while i thought I knew the ending, I was totally surprised.  Well worth a read
0312853254|4.0|This is the sequel to Ender's Game and was quite good.  The characters were better developed than in Ender's Game, although it didn't have a surprise plot twist that I enjoyed so much in Ender's Game.  Some of the science fiction biology was unrealistic, but it was interesting to think about nonetheless.
0761169253|5.0|This little book is full of fabulous ideas on how to jump start your creativity.  Austin Kleon is an artist and in this book he shares ideas on how to live a creative life. Kleon gives advice on how to look at the world as an artist.  The first chapter starts with telling you to steal like an artist.  What does this really mean?  It means nothing is original anymore.  \\"All creative work builds on what came before.\\" pg 7.  At first this thought made me uncomfortable and I realized it is because I am a teacher and hate when students cheat or copy.  Yet Austin Kleon gives \\"stealing\\" and \\"copying\\" a whole new meaning.  He says you should create a swipe file and put good ideas inside of it.  \\"there's only stuff worth stealing, and stuff that's not worth stealing.  Everything is up for grabs.\\" pg. 6<br /><br />\\"We learn by copying.\\" pg.33  Every person learns by imitation and my mother always said, that the ultimate compliment is to have someone copy you.  Copying is not the same as plagiarism.  Copying according to Kleon is trying to figure out how something works.  \\"First you have to figure out who to copy.  Second, you have to figure out what to copy.\\" \\"Who to copy is easy.  You copy your heroes.\\" Pg. 35  By the end of the process you learn who you are and see things through a different lens.  Your own work then becomes influenced by your heroes.<br /><br />Steal like an Artist is full of great artwork and inspiration and Kleon is right, no one ever told me these 10 things about being creative.  Kleon really makes you look at the world differently.  Yet he also gives practical advice that is worth hearing more than once, like don't quit your day job, stay of debt and marry well.I read this book one chapter at a time.  I could have easily devoured the book in one sitting but I wanted to savor it and let the lessons live in my brain for awhile so they could work their magic on me.<br /><br />After reading Steal like an Artist, I am looking at the world differently with a creative edge.  I have already made small changes in my life and am making time in my day to be creative.  I plan to reread Steal Like an Artist often.creative edge.  I have already made small changes in my life and am making time in my day to be creative.  I plan to reread Steal Like an Artist often.

B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Loved this movie.  Lots of action and typical comedic relief.  Cute if you view several in &#34;order&#34; (see Capt America and Thor first) as there are references to the other two movies.
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|The Movie, Beautiful Minds were realistically detailed.  An eye opener for detecting people with mental illnesses.<br />Matter of fact, I donated my copy to a relative who owns a Non-Profit Recovery Center,(for meeting sessions) .... specializing in Alcohol and Drug Addiction.  Great Selection!!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Really enjoyed this book. Reading it for my book club. Alexander did a great job describing his NDE. That had to be difficult to explain in earthly terms too! Doubters of the after life need to read this. Only negative thing was some of his medical terminology bogged it down a bit.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great escape game! I liked that the clues weren't too easy and I wished the game was longer. Excited for the sequel!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This is a great book. The struggle that Robie goes through is one of the best parts. The relationship he develops with Julie is what causes his conflict. I could not put it down.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fab game that gets the brain working.....but way too short....completed in about an hour.....we need lots more levels please!
0307341577|5.0|This book was excellent.  It started fairly slowly since there was a large build up where we learned all about the basic details of the murder and then all of the sudden you feel attached to the book.  Wanting to read every page to get to the ending to see what really happened that night of the murders.  The POV characters are great and getting inside thier heads really comes together in the end.  Highly recommended.
B002BY625A|5.0|Great book Mr. Ludlum was an awesome writer. This purchase completed my Bourne trilogy collection.<br />Once you get started you're going to want to find out what happens next.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|If you love Ian Rankin's old school detective John Rebus, you will love this book.  I was afraid we had seen the last of him with Exit Music but Rankin has found a way to bring him back, and I hope he does it again.
B009AMAGXK|1.0|The movie veered of the plot in the book almost immediately. Characters were completely left out and replaced by other characters in the book. My daughters and I were all VERY disappointed. I wish I had not purchased this movie. It was a total was of money.
B00DGMVC4C|5.0|This is a fast, fast Zuma-type game, match 3, bubbleshooter. What separates it from the rest of like games are it's GORGEOUS graphics, smooth and responsive movements and FANTASTIC power-ups. I bought this because I LOVE Sparkle, the original, but this one takes a fun, fast, pretty game and really makes it great!<br /><br />This game is much like Treasures of Montezuma 3 in look and feel and that is high praise, indeed! Treasures of Montezuma 3, Wonderlines and all the Playrix games have been my favorites games until this one. Games of this caliber are sadly few and far between. In this instance the high price is more than justified unlike their game, Azkend 2, which is completely nonsensical. The developers have left no stone unturned in making Sparkle 2 a visually arresting, exciting, smooth-playing and responsive game with lots of play and replay value. I hope there will be a Sparkle 3 and more because this is a winning formula for a game! Thank you, 10tons. Beautiful and so much fun!
B004T4M5TM|5.0|This was a great read...I literally laughed out loud every page. I read alot of books and that is a first. Thanks Tina!

B000069KGM|5.0|Great bass line throughout the album!  Great guitar with wonderful use of the wah pedal!  While my friends dispute which is the best version of &#34;I'm a Man,&#34; I believe Chicago's version is hard to beat.

1623420148|5.0|If erotica is not for you, TANGLED should not end up on your TBR.<br /><br />For those who'd like to dip a toe in...TANGLED is a fun, fast read with a side of OMG! escapades.<br /><br />What separates it from the pack?<br /><br />Drew Evans is absolutely the most raw, irrepressible jerk to ever enter The Redemption Tale. Yes, this is a redemption story. No, he doesn't have a \\"Come to Jesus\\" moment--more like a \\"come-to-Kate\\" moment.<br /><br />Allow me to explain. No, there's no time. Allow me to sum up:<br /><br />Drew is a gloriously proud, wealthy, womanizing investment banker. He never wants to 'ride the same coaster twice' and that tells you much about our anti-hero. What he does want? Kate Brooks. New hire at his firm. She's beautiful. She's brilliant. She's engaged...<br /><br />Oh, the irony.<br /><br />Poor Drew is attracted to a woman who is unattainable. And to make it worse? She's now competing for his clients. Still, he manages to grow a conscience. Also, he actually does some decent stuff--defending Kate from a lecherous client among those.<br /><br />When Kate is suddenly single, you guessed it: They get tangled, and he finds there's something quite special about being with a woman who stimulates more than his naughty bits. And yet, he can't trust the burgeoning relationship. As soon as there's a wave on the pond he chucks in a cinder block, blowing the whole thing clean out of the water.<br /><br />What happens next? Drew's sledgehammer approach to woo Kate back will either reunite them--or drive her to homicide. And, the ride is absolutely delicious.<br /><br />Thanks, Emma Chase, for Kate and Drew. I'll be sending you the bill for repairing my iPad.<br /><br />Who knew those things overheated?
B009G41CG2|4.0|I enjoy this game because it makes me think. I have always been a Mahjong addict. This one is real good to carry along on the Kindle and it's Free!! Can't beat that!

B00009RDGA|5.0|When it came out, saw it, liked it, forgot it.  Hundreds of thousands of movies later, I was enthralled from the start by Peter Bogandanovitch's gorgeous black and white photography of the plains during the depression.<br /><br />But the photography is outclassed by probably Ryan and Tatum O'Neal's best roles and acting ever.  Since the plot concerns her paternity, it's wonderful to watch them bicker over it, and for  him to so often be outsmarted (for his own good) by Addie.<br /><br />Watch it just for the beauty of the photography, enjoy the story as well.
B0091REZMW|5.0|its a fun game. and it was free so that was mice cause most games you have to pay for.

B002GY9F9K|1.0|Never have I been more disappointed with a tv adaption to a book than this series, the artistic licence taken is atrocious. None or very little holds true to a wonderfully written book that has depth and character. All this show seems to accomplish is hollywoodian cliche, and to the producers IT'S A SERIES PEOPLE YOU HAVE TIME TO STAY TRUE TO THE STORY LINE, i'd understand if it was a movie but seriously you might as well have said it was a whole new story line. SUPER DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!
1575666286|4.0|I bought because I wanted to see what was on it. This is not the latest edition, but is still interesting. Some things have been updated in its latest version (Healing the Gerson way) But I am not sorry I got it. There is something we can catch on this book for your own good. It's really fascinating  how these books (about Gerson therapy) make so mucho sense. We put so many toxic products in our bodies that is amazing how many of us don't get more sick.
1452115567|5.0|I have shown this book to people of all ages and everyone smiles and laughs at Maddie and her terrific feats of balance. It's a fun book and made you happy that you went on Mr. Humphrey's journey.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I read this book to understand what it was all just in case I went to see the movie . The story itself is thought provoking and tells the ugly nature of man with a redemptive side. There were chapters that went into detail on a few topics that could have just been explained in a few paragraphs. I ended up just paging through these sections. A nice feature is the ability to tap and hold to bring up the definition but sometimes the definition did not make sense or was not available. I believe this is a French novel translated into English. But in all one can get the gist of the story.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a great game, easily worth the money. Many levels, but I still wished it were longer. Can't wait for the next one.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|Love Bruce Willis's movies especially 'A Good Day to Die Hard'. Always a lot of action, some comedy and overall a very entertaining movie. Love the conflict between father and son and ending up 'Like Father, Like Son'! Excellent movie!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book gives the reader powerful insights to the life of a Navy Seal.  It shows you their toughness, their determination, and mostly their love of country.  I always had a lot of respect for the Seals, but even more so after reading this book.  Chris Kyle is an American hero.  I cannot even imagine how many mothers would have had to bury their young sons, if not for the job that Chris Kyle did in Iraq.  God bless the Navy Seals.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|i love wwii and i love the original weaphones. when i heard they were making a wwii update on facebook i was for sure gonna get it.

B007TNQ7EY|4.0|An awesome game, with a lot of features and a pretty cool but short history. It's fun to get in a car and crash all the people, but a little buggy. I like it, cannot wait for Gangstar Vegas!
B00000J7J4|5.0|Again, I wanted a copy for my home since the other one was at the office.  I need Santana to unwind to.

B00DF0POXA|5.0|Offensive. truthful. Unapologetic. Brilliant. The type of album that changes the way u listen to music. Keeping the album on repeat.

B008ZOHCKE|5.0|If you like writing  Then this is a good app for you  and you can draw  picture of people and animals
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Beecham House is an elegant home, mansion really, for retired musicians. Wilf, the charming and flirtatious Scotsman, brings a touch of good humored mischief to the place, while a few characters still harbor hard feeling from the past and are quite cantankerous. The older generation continuing to share their expertise in music with the youth and other members of the public who visit for the annual birthday party is a celebration of life and music. In this film, old dogs can still learn new tricks. The gentleman who is preparing to address the youth aquaints himself with modern hip hop music in order to be relevant in his message and an old romance that went sour gets a second chance. There are some f-bombs but they give fair warning that they are going to be \\"rude\\".
B0049IHX2C|2.0|The first \\"Men In Black\\" film was an inventive piece of science-fiction/comedy confectionary.  It was a tongue-in-cheek introduction to the most `underground' of underground government agencies, whose task was to monitor and handle alien (space alien, not illegal alien) immigration on planet Earth.  As refreshing the first film was, its sequel, \\"Men In Black 2\\" was just as plodding and incoherent.<br /><br />  At the end of the first film, Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) decided to leave the life and was neuralized by Agent J (Will Smith) and returned back to the world he left decades before to join MIB.  Of course, a new threat posed by the alien Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle) and her witless henchman, Scrad & Charlie (Johnny Knoxville), requires that K being brought back on duty and the neuralization reversed.  It has something to do with an unrealized secret possessed by Laura Vasquez (Rosario Dawson).<br /><br />  All this sounds well and good, but the movie just feels like a bunch of nothing.  It relies on the familiarity with the original characters to pass for a plot line; and parts of this film feel like they were just an excuse to put `man of the moment' Johnny Knoxville on the big screen, as well as give Michael Jackson a cameo.<br /><br />  Beyond this, there is nothing memorable about the plot or the resolution.  The underwhelming nature of \\"Men In Black 2\\" put the brakes on this series, which did not get back on track until the release of the vastly superior \\"Men In Black 3\\" 10 years later.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great fun app for horse lovers!!! Addicting too! Creates an exciting way for people to take care of a horse for free on a convenient device! Must download!
B009HEMW4W|4.0|When a third \\"Men In Black\\" film was released almost 10 years after the second one, many people shrugged and asked \\"why?\\"  In truth, \\"Men in Black 3\\" was a very necessary film.  It boosted the series by helping to remove the bad taste of the incoherent, and utterly irrelevant, \\"Men In Black 2\\".<br /><br />  While \\"MIB 3\\" does bring back Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones as Agents J and K, respectively, there are some notable changes.  Zed (Rip Torn) has passed away prior to this film and he is replaced by Agent O (Emma Thompson), who has a complicated history with Agent K.  When the story sends Agent J back in time, the younger versions of O and K are placed by Alice Eve and Josh Brolin (who does a perfect imitation of what you would think a young Agent K would be like).<br /><br />  The main story deals with the very lethal alien, Boris the Animal (he says, \\"It's just Boris!\\") being sprung from a Supermax prison on the surface of the moon, after more than 40 years of incarceration.  He locates some underground technology that allows him to travel back in time, prior to his capture, and kill the young Agent K, setting the stage for his species, the Boglodites, the invade and destroy Earth decades later.<br /><br />  The change in the timeline has everyone not remembering who Agent K is other than the much older agents (like O).  Yet, somehow, J was immune to the timeline change and his goal is to back in time, save K, defeat Boris and save the Earth.  Just your typical day at MIB.<br /><br />  The problem with the second film was that it was riding on the coattails of the first and using familiarity with the characters and environment as a substitute for an actual plot.  I felt that way when I saw it in 2002 and subsequent viewings on cable since then have not changed my opinion.  \\"MIB 3\\" brought a more coherent plot, with better villains and side characters.  The end result was a much-needed shot of adrenaline that led to tremendous box office returns and a guaranteeof \\"MIB 4\\".
1449410243|5.0|Just too funny! Noting like a good light-hearted read while your cat  is sleeping on your head. I really enjoyed this book and I suspect I will read it many times.
B001OSIV62|4.0|This documentary tells the story of Frenchman, Philippe Petit as he develops a passion for &#34;wire-walking&#34;. It includes actual footage from his own filming of his younger years, as well as footage leading up to his daring (and illegal) wire-walk between the World Trade Center towers in 1974. Fascinating story, but a bit draggy in places. Altogether, though, a heart stopping film.
B004H8GLXQ|1.0|I am a librarian who loves to read but the over-the-top meandering descriptions of the love for reading sounded more like reading twisted into a sick obsession and pseudo-life.  Also, flowering prose where every bit of every scene and emotion is sipped like fine wine and regurgitated onto the page is not for me.  I didn't find the main characters likable and I was not interested enough in why Vida Winter was secretive about her past to continue reading.  When I checked the reviews, I discovered that this is a literary version of a Flowers in the Attic type story with incest and sadistic abuse.  OK, enough already.  I'm not wading through all this mind murk to get to THAT.  For the record, I loved the classic gothic tale, Rebecca, but that book didn't try so hard to be literary.  I  had to know more about Rebecca and could not have stopped reading the book.  This novel managed to irritate me within the first 60 pages and it goes in the bag destined for the thrift shop.
B000BNI99K|5.0|Heard one of these CDs playing at a restaurant while having dinner and really liked it.  The waitress was nice enough to check it out for us and when I found that there was a collection of songs in one package I ordered it.  Great easy listening music or background music for a party.  The duet CD is great too.
0679890475|5.0|This is a board book and it is fun for my children to read.  We enjoy classic stories and this is an easy and enjoyable read.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|Continues to force close. Won't open for more than 5 minutes. Will give a 5 star once fixed. Upsetting because I love this game
067144901X|5.0|All of Sandra Boynton's books are silly and fun to read to little ones.  They are short, fun pictures to point to, and silly to get your little ones to engage.  I've been reading them to my children since they were each a year old.  No one has tired of them yet!  And of course, the best thing, they're easy to memorize.  Wonderful rhymes.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I love this game so much. It is fun and has great graphics. It is awesome to be in the world of Epic.
B000SW2F6M|5.0|The movie takes you back to the dark ages of Christianity. We think of ourselves as civilized now, and it is fascinating to watch how little humanity has changed: passions, love, power, greed....Excellent!
B003F46RVO|5.0|If you love vampires and some gore, this movie is awesome. Plus Jason Patric is so hot in this movie :)
B00C2VIA52|4.0|Good game.. for card game...  multiplay u either spend money or play a ton or be lucky as hell..  but great game just wish u could change heros
B0002YLC24|5.0|Better than Before Sunrise.  Seemingly effortless dialogue between two young actors on mature subjects.  Can't wait to see Before Midnight!
1603425381|5.0|I couldn't think of one complaint about this book, it's everything you'd want in a book showing you how to do various borders!  I wish I could think of a better description, but it's just wonderful!  (it certainly added a LOT to my medium sized-growing-crochet library)
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|Usually I like these games but I found this one hard to control. The comb wouldnt comb the hair the way I wanted it to. Of course you have to pay real money to unlock things. It was fun but just a bit annoying
B008I43DYU|1.0|It comes it greatly magnified so that it is unusable.  even rotating it to landscape does not help.  I want my .99 back!
B000FC10MU|4.0|Another macabre work from the delightfully warped mind of Neil Gaiman. Decidedly adult, this work takes the reader on a violent and at times deviant jaunt through the underworld of gods who were brought to America in the minds and hearts of generations of immigrants throughout the centuries. The main character, Shadow, is a human who is thrust into an unfamiliar world where old gods have grown weak and died off from being forgotten, and are relegated to an existence of grifting and conning unsuspecting humans. Shadow gets caught up in a battle between the old gods of folklore and myth, and the new gods of technology and mass media. Or so he is led to believe...
B00A8ECU24|2.0|This is a cute and fun game but it has problems. Once i had to start over the game because it was not working. Another time the game took away all my gems even though i did not buy anything. Now this game is giving me the day 1 bonus every time when i should be on day 5! And you can easily buy a pony by mistake. Actually its kind of a boring game. It is way to easy to move up in levels. I moved up 3 levels just yesterday!
B007HJ8LOE|4.0|Although I love this movie on so many levels I wish I could find the version that I viewed the first time I saw it. Toto's return home after 30 years for Alfredo's funeral and the coincidental blowing up of the Cinema Paradiso was made much more meaningful and poignant when the reunion with his first love was included. Where can I find this version?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its so fun to have to take care of ur very own horse I love it so much so so so so very much
0894803123|5.0|I decided to use my electric ice cream maker after collecting dust for many years. I have only made the basic French Vanilla which turned out yummy and actually froze very well where I didn't have to eat it all at once. A good thing and bad but was able to extend the enjoyment over a few days. Next will be the Orange Cream Dream...looks super easy that even I can accomplish. This book will keep me in IC for a long time.
1623420148|5.0|First off, she did an AMAZING job writing from a male's POV. I think she totally nailed it. It was witty and had me rolling around laughing my ass off<br /><br />I just love Drew! This book reminds me of Beautiful Bastard meets Wallbanger!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I have been unable to download the products to my kindle for android.  I have uninstalled and reinstalled and still cannot locate my recent purchased books.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Thank You Amazon for the 2nd season of the Walking Dead Complete series.<br />I couldn't stop watching it. I tried to watch just one episode a night, and save a little for later, but I watched the whole thing in just a few days. I'm looking forward to purchasing Season 3 when its available.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Excellent story line and love the way it fits into the Star Trek line.<br />Chris Pine really has you believing that he is Kirk
B008V59AFW|5.0|Big fan and happy to now own the album :) i listen to it all the time, product sent in a timely manner!
B00006G8HX|5.0|I'm sure any Trecky knows this movie and loves it.<br />I recommend it to any one else after seeing The Wrath of Kahn
B001GCUER0|5.0|This season offers more insight and character development. It hooks you right from the start and keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B0000683DH|5.0|Another excellent Star Trek movie.  Recommendation....see this first before seeing &#34;In Search of Spock&#34;<br />Recardo Maltoban is an excellent star.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|A must-have app. Instant weather info at your fingertips. Functions really good too. Buy it, use it, love it...word up!
B00CWIMY3O|5.0|Following an iconic performance by Anthony Hopkins might seem like an impossible task, but Mads Mikkelson isn't doing it alone.  The dynamic and true chemistry between Lecter and Will Graham (Hugh Darcy) unveils facets of the world's most famous fictional serial killer never touched in literature or film.  Backed by a great supporting cast and fantastic vision of Bryan Fuller, Hannibal the show puts you on the edge of your seat every bit as well as the source material.
B0033AI4PM|5.0|Barbra Streisand Shimes in this film, the songs are all top notch and this blu ray edition is absolutely beautiful! The colors are vibrant and the sound ( especially if you have a sound bar or surround sound) is high quality! I can watch this movie over and over! No wonder she won an Oscar for this role!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|really like this game. just trying to use up words so i can go back to playing it. me to I.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|For those that can't figure this out, you are a moron.  Yes it is a puzzle, read the intro and this can be done.  If you gave up because no instructions, great, you just proved you are not that smart.  This game had some challenges that I enjoyed.  Need more rooms though, eight is not enough.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Excellent Little Timewaster!!  I spent way too much time in this game at work!  Very addicting to learn how to drive the vehicles together the best score over the obstacles.  10/10 would download again.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I love a book with a great ending.  It is even better when the good guys win and the bad guys lose.  Now you just have to Read the book to figure out who are the good guys and who are the bad guys!  :)
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I loved this story! It fit Kabel to a tee. Damaged, broken but even he could be loved and forgiven. I can't wait for the next, will it be one of the Arrow brothers?
1451695187|5.0|An agnostic's trip into the afterlife, giving him data to bring back to enlighten us about what's ahead.  An unbeliever has already written a book to debunk Alexander's experiences, but his information will speak for itself to anyone with an open mind.  Whether you accept it all or not, it is a fascinating trip unlike any other.
B0016B6ZKG|4.0|This took some time getting used to, due to the synthesized-techno music intergrated, but after several spins, I began to like it more than I did before.  The extra star was for her voice.  Donna gave power to those lyrics and she sang the crap outta this cd!  She will make you bounce and dance, cause that's what she's known for.  My favorite is SAND ON MY FEET...I could play that song over and over non-stop!  STAMP YOUR FEET, I'M A FIRE...she just let loose and let the music take you away and I really liked it!  Donna, my love.....you will be missed!
B00AYR2FWA|4.0|I bought this for my father for Father's Day and he loves it, you can't go wrong with Willie Nelson.
B00B8WXG9G|3.0|I have enjoyed Paul Anka over the years, in particular when he is on the other side of the mike, i.e. producing.  The contributing artist were interesting, and I was looking forward to a little genre bending for Mr Anka.  At best, this was a cobbled together effort, with a wide range of production quality; at worst, it was mostly a waste of listening time. There are better efforts by other artists available, so I would recommend going elsewhere.  Body of Work, if you want to listen to Mr. Anka, is a good collection that is work the time and money.
B005HEPL8K|5.0|This is my favorite Star Trek Series. I wish all the seasons were available on HD. I think more shows should be available all the time for Prime Members.
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|From the second I saw the trailer for this movie, I had a feeling I was going to love it...<br />And I did!<br />There is a good balance between character development and actual horror. None of the characters feel as if they're just 'disposable'. Once the horror kicks in, it does NOT stop! Constant suspense, dread, etc. There is very little CGI in the movie, which makes everything look amazingly realistic. The gore is disgusting in the best way possible! I don't know how this movie didn't get an NC-17. This is probably one of the best horror movies I've seen in many years.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this to fans of the original film, and new fans!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|It lets me know what percentage of my battery is left. That's all I wanted to know.So I like it just fine
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I am in love with these books. I really don't want it to end. I feel so close to the characters. The writter really puts that connection in this book. Very sexy and explicit so I cannot leave it out b/c I do have 2 children.
B002BSHWUU|4.0|On time, and good conditions.....no problems and great price for this music gem. I gonna buy more in this page!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this app is my favorite app on my kindle ! i got addictaded to it right away! get this app and you wont regret it
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This trilogy was extremely intriguing. It is definitely for an adult female audience. It can be vulgar and extremely descriptive, but it has a beautiful love story from the beginning. The love story kept me going and the third and final book had a fantastic ending. It keeps you in hopes that there will be more books in the future by this author that add on to this thrilling story. I definitely recommend this trilogy.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My entire family thoroughly enjoys this show.  Very well written and acted.  We watched three episodes back to back last night, and will probably do the same again today.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I have not ever watched it until two weeks ago and I am hooked!!!  It is real entertaining, exciting as well as educating with great story lines.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|I was hoping that, despite the overwhelming negative reviews, I would find this movie to be at least mildly entertaining. I was wrong. I have many disappointments:<br /><br />1) The characters have absolutely no depth whatsoever. Judge all the books by their covers.<br />2) The actors were cliché and displayed wonderful overkill at best.<br />3) This movie is too graphic for small children, yet horridly boring for anyone I would deem old enough.<br /><br />I could go on and on, but other reviews will surely give a more thorough critique, I’m sure. I will say this though: the graphics were well done. Beautiful background scenery! Now, that doesn't make much of a movie, but…
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very cute!:D You get to compete in horse shows, clean stalls, groom your horse, and much, much more!! Great app!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It's great my kids love it ages 2, 11, and 17. Me and my husband play as well.always something new to try. And they love it
B003G4W49C|5.0|Knowing what is revealed at the ending only made rereading this book better, since I was now focused on observing the relationships and psychology of the characters instead of the direction of the plot. Even though the story is played out by very young characters, I feel that the content itself if much more mature and thought provoking, so I wouldn't write it off as another YA novel. I don't really put it in the same camp. Anyhoo... the enemy's gate is down.
0307719219|5.0|The authors are noted academic economists but &#34;Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty&#34; is very well written and avoids mathematical/technical explanations in the text (although the text is supported by reference to technical materials). The book convincingly makes the case for a strong postivie correlation between democratic political institutions and the rule of law and economic development, citing many historical cases. My only (minor) reservation about the book is that it does not at least briefly discuss the importance of other factors important to economic development such as geography, natural resources, climate, disease, literacy, etc.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is drivel.  Poorly written, poorly conceived, with characters that are unbelievable, sex scenes that are titillating only to very sheltered people who know nothing about the lifestyle James tries to portray, and not one character you'd want to root for.  I have absolutely no idea what has made this book so popular.  I couldn't get past the first third before deleting it from my Kindle in relief.
B00C7JGDBW|4.0|I was very disappointed that this item took one whole week to reach my home.  Being a Prime member for a number of years, it is normal to expect delivery within two days.  Recently however, (approx. the last few months), this schedule of delivery has been very disappointing.  Items are being received three, four and more days.  Fast delivery is the very reason I am a Prime member.  How long will it take for the upper echelon to understand that this &#34;new&#34; procedure (via Fed Ex and US Post Office) is not working.  UPS delivered second day every time.  If this sad state of delivery on items purchased continues, I will definitely need to reevaluate my choice of vendors in the future.<br /><br />Incidentally, the movie was worth the wait.
B006ZT47O0|5.0|Epica is on of the rare bands that is able to blend classical, opera, and death metal rifs into an inspirational colorful musical journey.  This is my first Epica album and there is not one track on this CD i did not like.  All the tracks have a similar theme yet are different enough to still hold the attention.  I purchased this on the bases of a seeing Epica's &#34;cry for the moon&#34; in a YourTube clip.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome they don't just have  horse's they have a rainbow unicorns my little sister loves it I highly recommend it. And the graphics are 5star HD quality.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|Moving, awe-inspiring story.  Chris M. led a life most of us have imagined in brief review, but would never dare.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|It took me a long time to connect this band's name with the new songs on the radio, I Will Wait and Lover of the Light. This is a great album with soulful songs and lyrics. I don't know what the name is for their style of music, but I love it. It is kind of a combination of alternative and folk, and kind of in the tradition that several new-ish groups, like Fun, are following, where the lyrics are meaningful and are combined with complex and intelligent instrumentals.
B0010T3UUC|3.0|Constricts my feet and makes them sweat even in socks, should have purchased the ones with vent holes as I'm on my feet all day.
1439153663|5.0|If you like novels that follow characters throughout many years, this is a great read.  The author uses such descriptive language that you feel that you are there sitting among them in the kitchen house. The fact that family isn't always biological is a point well made throughout the story.  This is a hard to put down novel, even when the events become difficult to read through.  I would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys historical fiction.
B00080DIWE|2.0|This is a Tamiya product. Tamiya makes the best engineered models on the planet. So, is this not the best engineered model stand? I don't know.<br /><br />OK, maybe it is the best, but it still sucks. The fasteners lack variety of placements and are too tight. Tight enough to deform the plastics used in models. I don't like that. Variety that does not support large ships nor small cars. I don't like being stuck on a narrow range of models!!!
0307744434|4.0|Now, this is one book everyone should read! If you're old, young, really young, a boy or a girl, a man or a woman, a father, mother, grandfather, whatever it is. You should read this. It's a universal book that created so much buzz in the book community online that it was really hard to miss it and when it came to bookstores in Bahrain immediately after the hype. I was excited to get it but only managed to find a really awesome copy from the thrift store. It was a limited edition copy and that was one of the many reasons why I wanted to pick it up.<br /><br />When I started reading the book, the setting the author wrote for us was the grey, and gloom of the late 1800's. It was set everywhere around Europe from France to Frankfurt. And then, sometimes the characters were in New York, or Boston and even Australia.<br /><br />The whole book corresponded with Le Cirque des Rêves, the circus that is only open at night. It starts with being in the circus then how the circus came to be and then how the circus carried out throughout the years. And believe it or not, the entire book didn't really have a centerpiece. By that I mean that it didn't really have one protagonist but many. It wasn't just about the circus but everyone else in it.<br /><br />The book did get really confusing because there were so many characters and Erin kept on bringing in more and more until perhaps near the end of the book. What made it even worse was when some chapters were dated in the early 1900's it then switches back to the 1800's. I got some characters and events mixed up that it was all too much for me. The book was most of the time overwhelming. Then comes the end of the book, I was a hundred pages away from the ending that only then did I get the whole story right. It's like the author knew the right moment to glue everything together. I'm incredibly impressed by magical world of the Night Circus. I really thought I wouldn't like it and I ended up loving it!<br /><br />It doesn't matter what age or what genres you like to read, just pick this book up and you won't be disappointed! This is a book that will become a classic!what age or what genres you like to read, just pick this book up and you won't be disappointed! This is a book that will become a classic!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I love the entire movie.  The creativity kept my attention throughout the movie. Gain some knowledge about the history.  Ben affleck done a fantastic job of bringing Argo to life. Light humor was also good.

B0094BB4TW|3.0|this app starts good but sometimes ur kindle will delete it and up delete it but it other than that it is really good
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I play almost everyday. Love that you can play the free tournament. Really helps me to unwind after a long day at work.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|Looked forward to this new album and was not disappointed. Lady Antebellum contines to keep up the quality of their music.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|its a great game for people who love to solve things. its a great way to slove puzzles. the down fall is that you have to date it in order to get the rest of the puzzles
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Gives me chills every time!! the best of the best. i recommend this for everyone! There is a reason why this is still on Broadway &#60;3
0060254920|5.0|I love this book. As an educator, parent, and art appreciator, this book fills the &#34;excellent children's literature&#34; cup for me!
B0079XPUOW|4.0|Scalzi has hit upon a most intriguing plot form. To get an idea of the interactions of the characters, just throw three stones into a placid lake and observe how the waves interact.
0756407125|5.0|I don't often review books. But this book is amazing. Patrick Rothfuss is a god. I felt captivated as when I first read Lord of The Rings many years ago. He's a brilliant story teller, and this book is brilliant and literally can't wait for the next. Kvothe is an entirely new sort of character than the cliched &#34;Hero's&#34; in other Fantasy books. Read it. Then read it again. Then tell the world about what you read.
B008VVT51U|4.0|This movie was just fun.  Some serious stuff, naturally there had to be a Gay in it, like that is all there are in this world!  Get past that and enjoy the imagination of the writer, it was mostly good clean fun.  Good actors and acting.  Opens your mind a bit about India and it's people.  I would have MUCH rather rented it, but that was't  an option.  The Hollywood<br />money grubbers allow you ONLY to purchase if you want to see this two year old movie. The creeps!
B00873GRU4|5.0|It was different and unique. It makes you think of a possible future. Really good read. Bring on the movie
B00164GDA0|5.0|This Amazing Movie just get better when you remember that are based on one of the most incredible Stephen King Novel called the corpse.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I enjoyed this book, except for the part where he receives a head injury. The situation should have been explored with a little more detail! But it was a good read!!
B005PK57IK|4.0|I've enjoyed every segment of The Good Wife,not sure if I'll  like the outcome of this segment,planning to finish soon.Looking forward segment 4,hoping it will be offered with free prime
B004W1GCNC|5.0|This short series reminds me of Downton Abbey!! A definite drama filled story... I wish there were more to watch!
0525952926|5.0|This book has something for everyone - history, politics, romance, adventure, war, and peace. Ken Follett does not disappoint! Can't wait to comple tree e the trilogy!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|the only app i actually play.<br />okay.... i play this game like an addict with unlimeted drugs.<br />too bad my battery doesnt last forever. lol
B00CWY76CC|5.0|One of the most entertaining games I've come across in a long time. It's challenging and a great way to spend time while you're waiting in line.
B000V5Y1SQ|4.0|Was worth watching, even if it was 20 years ago when it was first shown. So on to season 2 .
B000VHMF0A|4.0|This isn't my typical listening taste, but sometimes you need a little reggae for the beach.  This covers all the Marley hits that a not-so-diehard fan like myself is looking for.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A great read.  I couldn't put it down.  The ending was a bit upsetting  not what I pictured happened at all.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It was short but entertaining.  I would like to see more room s.  The puzzles were not to hard but did make you think a little. All said I enjoyed playing it.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is a very enjoyable game for everyone. The graphics are amazing. I love that the quests you do aren't far fetched like some games.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|Nice cover, flexible, easy to install and take out the kindle fire HD, we really like the added feature of simply closing the cover causes the kindle to go on standby thus preserving battery life.
B003F1WM2K|5.0|Patti's eloquent and poetic way of poking little keyholes into the history of NYC art, music and the city itself through the story of her and Robert Mapplethorpe is simply captivating. I haven't been this spellbound by a book in years.<br /><br />If you're into anything that happened in Chelsea and LES between the late 60s and mid 70s, you need this book.<br /><br />An easy 5 stars and enthusiastic 2 thumbs up.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was an amazing game! It was a bit challenging at some points, but solutions come quite easily. The graphics are absolutely wonderful. The gameplay can be a bit slow if you are used to fast-paced games, but be patient. Instead of just giving you hints right away, it gives you time to think for yourself. This game is totally worth the $2.00! I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested!
0060005696|4.0|I'm definitely a  maximizer; reading this book was very refreshing for me! I could relate to the experiences Barry explained, I thought my 'problems' were just specific to me, but actually it turns out there are a whole type of human in our modern times, who have the same experiences as me.. so nice to know I wasn't alone..!<br /><br />It helped reading this because I'm more aware of why I find it hard to chose. Sometimes trivial tasks, like getting a new camera, takes me ages and ages (because I research all the choices available.. and there are too many)<br /><br />Barry explains the problems maximizers are faced with and gives plausible explanations on why modern living conditions makes it more difficult for maximizers and also why our modern environment causes more people to become maximizers..<br /><br />Interestingly, at the beginning of the book, there are a few tests you can do to gauge how much of a maximizers you are and also how happy you are.  I ran these tests on myself and a group of friends, and I did find the results as the book predicted, the more of a maximizers you are, the more unsatisfied with life you are..<br /><br />Look, I won't bore you with lodes of writing but.. in summary:<br />* Book is worth a read.. its only 236 pages, but a little long winded.. so I had to push myself to finish it.. but you know what, Im really glad I read it.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This is one of those read into books. Once several paragraphs had been red I started to realize what this book was about. This book was referred to me, and I couldn't of read it at a better time.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I think this is close to a non-fictionional account of how things might<br />be for children and adults who have a family member that is<br />different from the &#34;norm&#34;. Authentic writing style, and captivating.
B006H5120E|1.0|I watched this movie in 2D several times in the past when it was newly released and was pretty excited when I saw it advertized on 3D by Amazon.<br />However, my expectation was dashed when the 3D Blu-ray disc I purchased only played about one-sixth of the movie. (the recording was only about 20 Minutes to the end of the movie)<br />Having experienced this kind of problem with Amazon 3D disc orders, I think I am done with making 3D Blu-ray disc orders on line except when in the US for vacation.
B000PC0S5K|3.0|Eckhart Tolle does a great job of bringing the inner and outer self together.  Much of what he says will fit with any religious background some, but not all.  I liked The Power of Now better.  Once one gets past the flowers in the beginning and evolutionary acquiescence there's some good stuff.  We all struggle with the &#34;watcher&#34; taming the &#34;thinker.&#34;  The thinker lives a story and the watcher lives reality, now.  The ultimate watcher wasJesus, who was completely conscious all the time.  Fortunately, through his example, we can live as lovingly as he.  Reincarnation? You'll have to read and draw your own conclusions.<br /><br />Tolle is interesting and I like what he writes because he finds a place for faith in a post-modern, post-evangelical world that is compatible with most religions, even Christianity!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was very pleased with The Hunger Games.  The writing is excellent, and the storyline very well woven to keep my interest until the last sentence.  Very good book
B000N2HBSO|5.0|A team of rivals is unbelievably rich in its description and analysis of Lincoln, his presidency, his cabinet, and his country. You must read this book.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I have loved this series for a while, and THIS is an amazing app. It loses a star for the entire world pass thing, but other than that it is as good as all of the other games. Also, I would love to see an update where you can add adjectives to things after spawning them without potions, including yourself. A giant flying invincible horrifying cold fat ugly insect-like brown powerful heavy Maxwell would be amazing.
B003IEJZUG|4.0|The book was thoughtfully written, and lush with description. I came to care deeply for Pi and Richard Parker.<br /><br /> The illustrations were lovely and added a depth to the story, enhanced the story.
B008602KQI|1.0|sucked, sucked, sucked.  Do not see what the hell all the fuss was about this boring movie. Do not waste your time watching this!
B00BG08FKK|5.0|Love it, Love it, Love it!  I can't stop listening to this CD.  The whole movie comes back each time I listen to it.  We listened to both CDs on our 8 hour car trip to Maine, and even my husband who is a solid country music fan enjoyed every moment of it.  We saw the show live on Broadway a number of years ago, so it all came back!  Shipping and purchase process could not be easier.  Thank you.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I would recommend this toy as educational for youngsters and challenging for adults as it has kept the whole family especially my 8 year old spellbound
B00AECGQF2|5.0|The time that I got this game was Christmas I thought it was expensive my brother loves this game but I don't like that it is 3$ no in app purchases nothing locked good because have  no money because I bought the game
B00BGD8CFK|5.0|This is by far the best case I have had for my phone! I love it! I also like how solid but slim it feels. I like how you can switch colors in and out! Great job! 👍
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I love the first hand account and the emotion that went through some of the kills and fire fights. It kept me reading which I usually don't do.
157421327X|5.0|would highly recomend this book !!!  loved the how to parts!!  if you are learning to draw this is a must!!
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|I loved the aspect of having a lot of the gaming characters in this movie and it was a pretty average animation movie but something about this would make me want to own this if I was a gaming fan as well.
B000003CMC|5.0|Had forgotten how good this album was!  Trying to replace my old album collection and this was a must have.
B002361MLA|5.0|Be aware that the audio portion for use on your Kindle Fire stops at chapter 8 and doesn't reach the end.
B00CBLQCO4|5.0|When the Berlin Wall came down I wondered what Le Carr&eacute; would write about. No need to have had concern, in this book he is back as good as ever. Tension, well rounded characters, everything you want from this author.
B00BPXKWGS|5.0|Green was a pivotal album for R.E.M., not only because it was their first on a major label but also because it demonstrated a big change in the band's sound. While the trademark guitars and catchy anthems were still there it also signaled the period where instruments like the mandolin became more prevalent in their songwriting. Green may not be one of my favorite R.E.M. records but it's definitely a solid and enjoyable one when taken for what it is. Everyone knows the hits like Orange Crush and Stand, as well as fan-favorites like Pop Song 89, World Leader Pretend, and Get Up. The folksy sounds of Hairshirt and You Are the Everything are a far departure for the group, yet they sound confident and exciting, given the album a unique sound that greatly expanded their talents. Even the hidden track, aptly named Untitled, is a favorite of mine and displays a pop finesse that few groups have been able conjure so well. Some fans may have been jumping ship and crying \\"Sellouts!\\" but there's no doubt that Green ushered in a new wave of fans and media exposure. It's the sound of a band on the cusp of superstardom.<br /><br />This deluxe edition is certainly a worthy investment for the dedicated fan. The remaster sounds solid and it's certainly an improvement over the tinny sound of the original. To my ears it sounds pretty balanced and isn't too compressed the way many remasters are today. The bonus disc is a great show and something I'm glad to have. I realize collectors probably have this show already but for those of us who don't it's a worthy and energetic performance from a band that's been refined through endless touring. The packaging itself follows the pattern of the last three remasters, with the two discs, booklet, four postcards, and giant poster all included in a flip-top box. My only complaint is that the cardboard slipcases that house the discs are pretty tight and getting them out requires some effort at first. My discs had some minor scratches and this kind of packaging looks nice but fails to be truly functional. That's the only real gripe I have with this set and if you're familiar with how the others are set up then you know what to expect.<br /><br />Overall this is another great deluxe edition and hopefully their 90's work will see a similar treatment at some point down the road. It's a great set that does justice both in terms of sound and content. If you're a fan who's looking to upgrade their collection then this set is the way to go.packaging looks nice but fails to be truly functional.

B0094K1WZE|5.0|This is a movie you should watch instead of just passing it over. The movie is a nice addition to the mission impossible franchise. That is all
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love this app! Very fun! Can't stop playing it! Love the music they play too. Thanks for creating this game!
B007HYV56U|5.0|I have so many fond memories of going to Monaco in the late 60's and early 70's and this movie always brings back memories
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This really stands out among the sound apps ( I've tried a LOT of them). There are no annoying skips and you can program sounds in an infinite number of combinations.  Lately I've gone with the 'pre-sleep' binaural tone mixed with 'orchestra' and 'night'. 'Urban rain' is another gem. Use it while reading an e-book in bed and you'll be out like a light in under fifteen minutes.
B004FHCH96|4.0|Upon watching it for the first time I had no clue about why this movie ended the way it did until I watched the extra portion of the DVD. Then the movie made since. I recommend it to movie buffs.
B00B29J0I6|1.0|Horrible game. Downloaded to my Kindle Fire and it started to load and then stopped. It then caused my kindle to turn off. It took forever to boot back up. Immediately uninstalled. Maybe it id fine for others but definatly not for me.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|This psycho thriller is one for the ages. This is a movie that will stand as one of the best movies of this decade. I can watch this movie over and over and never get bored.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Though I agree a camera app should have been included, this developer should not be punished for a decision by Amazon. That being said, I needed an app to record video, and this app did it easily and without issue. As a bonus, it includes a shortcut to your recorded videos, which I still can't figure out how to get to without this app. Until Amazon includes a comparable video cam app, I recommend this one.
B00884GR0W|3.0|The game was quite similar to Minecraft. However, I don't feel like such a game was really meant for a tablet though. The world didn't always make sense either. If you dug down for a while, sometimes you could fall through the sky and into some other world with purple glowing stones everywhere, and it was kind of weird. It wasn't a horrible game, but i just couldn't get interested enough in it. Maybe someone else might like it, but It wasn't really for me.
B009LRE040|2.0|The movie was confusing, convoluted, and not very good. The best parts were Anne Hathaway as Catwoman - she made the movie more lively, entertaining, and bearable. Otherwise, this batman movie was rather boring and the villain Bane is largely forgettable.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|This light works everytime I climb up and down my dark staircase. I would recommend getting one for any dark corner of the house.
B00A83075M|5.0|This was such a cute, sweet, adorable, fun, lovable movie. It's perfect for children, but very enjoyable even as an adult. I liked the themes of losers wanting to be winners that ran through the movie. The ending was a wonderful surprise. This movie was a delight and I highly recommend it. It left me in a good mood! Classic and so cute!
B0035XVVDY|5.0|It's a great movie with a twist at the end.  The real reason I bought the movie?  It's because Gerard Butler is hot!!
B00B5AP7NY|3.0|Unfortunately the best thing about this is the figure that's why I gave it 3 stars at all.  The movie is just the clips from the Batman Lego game strung together with a few scenes in between to link them together...My son loved the clutch powers and bionicles so I hoped this would have been just as good.  A new story line that supported the ames would have been better.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|As with the books before it, this was another one I couldn't put down! Love this series and can't wait until the next book comes out! If you haven't checked out this series yet, do yourself a favor and read them all. You will be glad you did!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|For quite a while, I felt quite confused about what I need to do to get the body I want.<br />There is so much conflicting advice, that when I decided to go with one, I wasn't confident I was doing the right thing, and that makes it MUCH harder.<br /><br />Then I got this book.<br /><br />This book is one of the best purchases I've ever made!<br />It totally un-confused me and now I've got a plan to get the body I want and I feel confident about what I'm doing.<br />It is a very comprehensive book and will explain in detail, just about everything to do and not to do.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to take the guess work out of getting fit.
1433503794|1.0|I don't usually do reviews.. However, I decided to do one for this since I did spend quite a bit of money.<br /><br />I liked the content within the bible. However, the quality of this bible is horrible. The binding makes the page crumple altogether. Half of the bible is in regular font and the other half is in BOLD. And the bible I purchased from the store, the pages were stuck together like glue and wasn't part of the binding, meaning after years of usage, the pages could very well fall out.<br />This bible is going back. Wish Crossway would read these reviews and learn a little more about their mistakes and have better quality control.<br />1 Star for quality.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|My son had been dying to see this, and we missed it when it was in the theatre.  We watched it twice on demand and it was much better than I anticipated.  It kept my interest and had humor that both adults and children could appreciate.  It was a little sappy and corny, but I'd much rather have that than blood, gore and killing in a movie.  My son loved it and forced even my husband to watch it.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|The game was amazing for the first few days I had it, but now the game keeps force closing on my Kindle Fire. It takes me several time till the game actually starts working properly but it`s still really annoying. I blame the ad that always pops up at the start of the game. I give it 4, stars for now.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|Found this hard to read as the story jumped from interview to interview. No main plot or character to follow.
B000FCK65W|5.0|I read this book years ago and loved it.  Recently I was in New York and really loved all the old buildings in Brooklyn<br />And the memory of reading this book came right back to me. Very enjoyable.
B00BEU19ZU|5.0|So far this app seems really cool, but I haven't travelled yet. I like how I can store everything from flight numbers to hotels. If I could just put kennel reservations in here it would be tops!!
B00APUYN0I|3.0|I was surprised.  I knew it would be stupid but it was also somewhat humorous.  Sort of a Glee spin off...
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|A very funny and cute movie. Pretty unique story line as well. Some things were a bit on the violent side but it's whatever.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Great!!!  I have been watching episodes in marathon but I only have about 2 hours after work so it is taking a little while.
B005LAII80|5.0|Like grimy 80's style violent sci-fi ? Robocop ? The Hidden ? Hate movies that are way to long ? Dredd has you covered. 89ish minutes of bliss. Think 3D sucks ? So did I, until this. KILLER. But you blew it and didn't see Dredd in the theater. My 2009 TV leaves me with nothing to say about the Blu-ray 3D.
0316023744|5.0|This is eaily the best general history of the second world war that I have read. A feature is the way the author links together events that take place on opposite sides of the world. It is very well written. I have two minor criticism. A short appendix of the main participants and a table giving the equivalent military ranks for the different nations involved would be useful.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this because it is like facebook but way better I love it I love it I love it, I just you can say I realy love this app...........best ever
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|It is I historic game with real life experience of the soldier in battle a person how love history it is accurate
B009GXHOW4|1.0|I tried to.switch my creative world to survival but it didnt work!!!! ! I HATE IT !!!! ALL MY FRIENDS LUV IT BUT I DONT KNOW WHY.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|this app is really fun. It has alot of photos that i can play with. If you haven't download this app, you should!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Well done Jodi Picoult. I love how your books are always so well reasearched and the story told so beautifully. Another page turner.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I couldn't put it down. This is another Jack Reacher story that was exciting through the whole book. I highly recommend it.
B001JI5DRC|5.0|One of the very best movies made! Tom Hanks was fantastic and Ron Howard made one of the best movies ever. Both should have won academy awards.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have  Temple Run 2 and Temple Run and enjoy playing both of them--but I must say that Temple Run 2 is the more challenging of the two--not to take away anything from Temple Run .I play them both equally --they're unique unto themselves is all. Enjoy!!
B00B29J0I6|5.0|I love how it is a strategy and u can a lot of levels. even though it is a free game
B007SYWFRM|4.0|It takes too many acorns and/or money to buy new items, when you get into the higher levels.  You also must sign into Facebook to visit other villages.  I don't like Facebook.  My business is my business not the whole world's.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|This one reminded me a little of fire maple's Lost City in that it was very pretty with beautiful music and visuals. The puzzles were fun and the story line was engaging thug not too detailed.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|Anyone who enjoy sculpting the body needs to watch the birth of its origin.  This movie gets you motivated to train.
044024613X|5.0|Great book, great characters, well told. Couldn't wait to finish it to see what happened, but didn't want it to end! Lots of twists to keep the reader reading.
B005URRCUY|5.0|The Black Keys ROCK. Terriffic from start to finish. I recommend this to anyone who likes rock, or rythm and blues.
B004DM0UII|4.0|What a great app! One of the more intuitive and easy to use radio players:-)  I am very happy with it, and it was free when I got it!
B0063M22QO|1.0|It took me an hour and a half to complete all of the puzzles which were extremely simple, then it prompted me to buy another game to continue.  Not impressed.  :(
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Addictive and challenging. Always amazed at the creative minds behind these games. Have to use the help sometimes but most of them I can get through.
193700788X|5.0|Although completely not what I expected to happen, this book was just as great as all the rest!  I read it in half a day!  I'm amazed that Ms. Harris continues to be able to create such an intricate plot.  It was great to see all of our former characters one last time.  Although I thought the story might have been slightly rushed to a conclusion and I'm not sure every story is completely \\"tied-up,\\" this is an overall wonderful book, and I would definitely buy it again.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|No Easy Day is a  clear pictures of what heroes are made of--well prepared, disciplined to take risks, patient and enduring.
B00B29J0I6|5.0|I like to play enough of a game to give fellow customers an honest enough review. While some games I will play to completion first, after playing this one for about 10 levels I think I have enough.  This game starts out pretty cute in a robot factory with robot heads being crated up. The 3rd one (roby) fakes a defect to avoid the crate and finds that the crate is the only way out. That is where you take over. Each level has several crates and you need to figure out the correct one(s) to break in order to coolect each levels three gears (same as the &quot;stars&quot; that all physic based game has for scoring purposes) then fall into the crate. Of course each level increases in difficulty with some adding more elements along the way (like finding and helping friends). This game is fun and (so far) is easy enough for the much younger crowd to enjoy.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love to play Bing and this is probably one of the most fun ones that I have purchased. Love it!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I had lots of fun playing this game. I had so much fun that I had to buy the game so that I could finish it and I still didn't finish it so I had to stay up past my 11:00 pm bedtime so that I could finish it.
B007D5E7C2|5.0|I love this series, and now having it in my library it wonderful.  I will keep adding to my collection.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This app is fun to play. Lots of powerups, lots of high stake games to win big. I tell everyone about this app.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I like the time management aspect, but also the strategy part of it. It has been a favorite computer game of mine for a long time, and now it's a convenient app on my tablet!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I would say as games of this type go that it is one of the best. I personally rate it better than Temple Run. Subway Surf has definitely helped me pass more than one boring afternoon away.
B007ZD17XO|4.0|This game encourages speed, so it's fast paced.  Really enjoy playing it.<br />I'm not good at virtual reality games, so it's great to have games that I can play.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Should try its a fun game to play. I really like it it has a lot of building and extras to build and put up
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|The book was enjoyable and exactly what I wanted.  I had no idea what I wanted, but it delivered flawlessly.  I never figured out who's funeral the main character came from in the beginning, I don't think it ever mentions it.  It must not be important, but I reread the first and last chapters just in case, to no avail.<br /><br />Buy it.
B0026Q8EWW|5.0|This movie really shows a good example for a physics class. I would recommend that any teach use it to help demonstrate our justice system and flaws within.
B007XGJK4G|5.0|I had always loved Marley's songs but had only a faint idea of their political importance. This documentary covers that aspect of it beautifully while making extraordinary use of his songs as the background score.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Love to play Angry Birds and would recommend this game to all my friends from the ages of nine to ninety.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Ok so this is a pre apocalyptic doomsday game based on the future more like a black ops 2 -black ops  1 style game it's practically a cliff hanger  it's not that intended for children some of the content might make people MAD but hey it's worth every penny  it's a good game  if u like war GET THIS GAME
B00CATSONE|5.0|Fast moving...As well as an accurate and fair description of events.  It becomes inspirational for individuals to realize what one person can accomplish with hard work and dedication.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I travel all around town from one end of the valley to the other. Arriving on time is absolute. I get the best directions from Google maps
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Cute game. You have to solve a series of steps to find the key to open the door.  The door leads to another room and another. Good fun clean graphics. Not hard but entertaining.
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|The trailers on TV didn't even hint at what this movie was really about.<br /><br />I was expecting a thriller, not a movie full of the exploration of the main character's deep seated issues and angst.<br /><br />Denzel Washington does give, as usual, a 5 star performance.
0786956291|4.0|This is a very basic kit but has almost everything you need to start playing DnD. The rules and adventure were a bit too simple for me so I quickly purchased the Dungeon Masters set afterwards to continue my playing. Good if you really want to get into DnD (and have a bit of money) but I would recommend purchasing the DM's set as it is more elaborate than this.
B00B29J0I6|4.0|This game is simple and ADDICTIVE.  I don't have time to be playing addictive games but now Ima be late to the gym because this sucked me in!  Haha!
B00A861QMM|1.0|I would have liked something not romantic with such a graphic. I hope teenagers dont get any ideas about romanticism from this.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Totally enjoyed watching, now I have to wait until January 2014 to see what happens next.  I hope that it will be as well done as the first 3 seasons. Going to miss Matthew
B00B7Y0206|3.0|It's easy to get to their choices for the day on YouTube.  It's not so easy to find what you might want on the Kindle.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book is a wonderful read.  It held my attention from page 1 to the last.  It is amazing how two stories were interwoven.  Will definetely recommend.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|sick humor,some idiot might take this show to heart. well written,little gags to look for in backgrounds.keeps you watching.not for everyone.
0525478817|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars is an amazing book! Quote-worthy, crush-worthy, and most of all-tear-worthy. I don't normally like sad books because they make me, well sad. This was an exception. It wasn't a dwell-on-it I-hate-the-world can't-stop-crying type of novel, it's just heart warming and heart breaking at the same time.  Read it-you'll know what I'm saying.<br />John Green brings his characters to life and makes sure that they don't leave your mind. When the book was over, I couldn't decide what to think about it. It kind of just ended-but it strangely fits and makes it even better.<br />I highly recommend to those who enjoy heart-warming YA romance.
B003L77GRO|5.0|how far can these writers go? seems pretty far still not goofy or too predictable.we will see! gotta cut out.
147674355X|5.0|There is something about Dean that scares Sky. Something about him brings up memories, memories that can't be true. Or are they?<br />Turns out there is more to Dean than Sky thought-and his secret involves her.<br />This book was an emotional roller coaster. I loved Sky and Dean-they were cute together and were both developed well by the author.<br />And I did not see the twist coming! This book also gives you mixed feelings on the difference between right and wrong, and everything between. This is a book that you won't be able to get out of your head for a while. It's worth the emotions that it brings, and I cannot wait for the next one!<br />I recommend this for those who enjoy a good NA romance book.
1416955070|4.0|If you like the Hunger Games, Harry Potter, and other similar series you will enjoy this book.  Its a fun and entertaining story.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really liked this game, but was not happy when I got through all of the levels in a few hours. It really helps keep your mind active and deducing strategies. One of the puzzles was difficult because the clue had a dark and white color combination, but when you had to translate that elsewhere, you had to use a wood system of raised or non- raised pieces which I felt did not translate well. A bit of a stretch. Otherwise, the game was great fun.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|...and mesmerized by a puzzle game. Didn't want to finish it. Definitely a challenge but not frustratingly so.. Loved the storyline, the music, the intelligence of this game. Great entertainment.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Love all the Quells, but Memento is the best of all. So much fun while I'm playing and actually feel a little smarter each time I'm finished. Already looking forward to the next version.

159463176X|5.0|I have read all three of Hosseini's books, &#34;The Kite Runner,&#34; &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns,&#34; and now &#34;And the Mountains Echoed&#34; and have loved reading all three equally. Through his command of story telling, he paints for the reader a description of Afghanistan and its people, making the the land come alive and the people real through the heart breaking stories he skillfully weaves together. His books are a must read! I hope he writes many more books!
1623420148|5.0|I grew up with only brothers and now as an adult I live with two guys but really feel like ten with all their friends so reading this book in the guy's POV was really funny. I found myself laughing so much because it is so true. I loved this book! Yes the guy is a pig but I mean really what guys aren't? Also the romance in it isn't all flowers and candy. The author tells it how it can be in real life. The guy isn't always going to be always romantic and perfect and so many other books just aren't realistic so this was something really refreshing. Although their love for each other was really touching and his ways of trying to win her back we just hilarious and adorable. I would recommend it. I couldn't seem to stop reading it. Can't wait for more to come!
B008KP6ENE|5.0|I love this RPG game, so much fun. The controls are very responsive. Graphics are nice even on a smartphone. Lots of quests, has a Mario feel to it.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|0I don't know y this game isn't at the top of the list! Its fun and easy,but not too easy! Five stars from this guy!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This game is just like Cut The Rope, just as fun and challenging. And the dudes are really cute. Each level has to do with any type of table surface and you connect them to scare the dude that waves to eat them. Really fun!
B00B2TTVNU|5.0|Valentina's playing is superb, Symphony is fantastic, sound engineering is top notch.<br />Even the Rac-man  would have loved this. She's raised the bar with this one.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game with my fb friends. Sometimes it won't load and I have to download it again from the cloud but when it works it works great! I love it!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book describes the afterlife in a more logical and believable  way than any I've read. The reader becomes keenly aware that the next world is only one breath away.<br /><br />Only about half the book is about his actual afterlife experience; the remainder is about many other aspects of his life, before, during, and after his death experience. The narration alternates throughout the book between the death experience and other parts of his life, from childhood to the medical drama going on during his coma.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I loved this movie as a teen.  Now I can share it with my children and grandchildren.  Julie Andrews is timeless

0446547573|2.0|I'm not big on sappy love stories. I read this for a book club. I've only read one other book by him, and I liked it better than this one. The shift in point of view was confusing at times. Wasn't my favorite.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|awesome game. can't wait for the new levels. I just love escape games. kind of wish there were some sort of hints though.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|It's a very good app, I especially like the chart of battery charge, it gives the app a new dimension. The only thing I don't like is whenever you plug the tablet in, it goes straight to this app, and it happens a lot when you bump the cord with your hand. Despite this, it is a very nice app, I recommend it to any future purchasers of any app in this \\"category\\".
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|Looking for something new?  A twist that you cannot predict?  Then do not read this book.  It was okay otherwise.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Warm bodies may be the only movie ever made from the Zombie's point of view. R's ongoing inner monologue is funny, poignant, and insightful. Nick Hoult and Rob Cordry are memorable as best Zombie friends. The message of the movie is sweet and hopeful, yet there is just enough 'horror & bloodshed' to keep the guys from squirming in their seats.
B00DBSZJRM|1.0|This is the stupidest telling of this tale ever!  Lame writing, inept direction and non-acting! The outcome was totally foreseeable in about 15 minutes.  The 'suspense' was laughable.  Absolute trash!
B004DK5CW4|5.0|I just get chills at the very last race he runs in this movie! Excellent for any horse lover! So go out and buy it!
B005COO1X6|4.0|As usual, King writes with an ease that draws the reader in. The settings are common to all of us and that makes the story that much more believable. I love his writing. This was a quick, bed-time read for me.
B00005JMCN|5.0|One scene is kinda needed to be watched by parents first if your child is under 12 or 13. Other than that is is spectacular.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|From start to finish this a good album. All the songs are good and by far one of my favorite albums of 2012
B008KE3960|1.0|Did not download, upon looking at other reviews, they showed that it is not worth the click to download, wouldn't recommend trying to get it
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Excellent movie.From the start of the movie till the end,you won't want to leave to leave your seat.Jennifer Lawrence was excellent and you can see why she won the Academy Award.Don't want to give anything away so you'll have to see it and you be the judge.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is great for anyone who is looking for a puzzling game! I love all the levels and the room details!good luck to all!
B00BC24NT4|3.0|If you're into British ministerial political machinations you'll really love this book.  If not, I think you'll be bored.  Great opening though.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This was my first game on my Kindle Fire.  It was a good learning tool, as well as a lot of fun.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|This is complete garbage! What a waste of time and money.  Kanye has always been a bit of a pretentious prick but he's always had a hit or two that keeps him thinking he's the shhh. This just plain sucks, hopefully people will realize its not just this CD he's never been that good but if you were judging by the size of that ego of his you'd think he was 2pac or Biggie.....
B000ZLFALS|4.0|I have never really been into the Beatles however this movie places the songs with the characters and the scenes and the words. Oh I could just go on and on. It's a love story and a musical. I like very few musicals, this one I love. It is best viewed on Blu Ray to be completely honest, for the best affect. Don't let the fact that it's a few years old bother you, this movie is timeless. It's simply beautiful.
B00BZW5W3W|5.0|The Washington Post calls this artful, new album \\"Electrifying.\\" This stunning new release, on Shanachie Entertainment, features 15 luscious and heartfelt tracks from the Diva of Smooth! You may know Maysa from her work as featured vocalist with the UK's funk and soul sensation Incognito and/or as a core member of Stevie Wonder's Wonderlove.

In great anticipation and with high expectiations I've been awaitng the release of BLUE VELVET SOUL... only for Maysa to blow past even her own outstanding standards!

B00D2K40WY|3.0|I really like this game but u have to buy a lot of things. And not everyone has a lot of money plus I am not a big spender.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I liked it alot not one to buy games but i ended up getting  this one. I will be looking for more like this game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game to practice for an actual horse !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />The graphics are good never blurry and that's a nice thing to have
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I had a physical keyboard for the longest time and I resisted the touch keyboard. I don't like typing on the touch screen at all. I have had a DROID X2 and now the DROID RAZR HD. SwiftKey keeps me from wanting to throw the phone.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Simple as the first one except with a few twists. Nonetheless a solid game to play when you are bored. If you are considering getting this just get it it is free and fun
B009ME47H2|4.0|This voice recorder is simple to use and very basic.  Free is good.  The volume of the recording was very low, even though the volume on my kindle was on high.  This recorded over an hour long meeting, and made taking notes simple.  There is a slider to adjust where on the recording you want to go.  I thought my kindle had turned off, the screen went blank and was unresponsive, but it turned out that it kept recorning even when I closed the kindle, which was great.<br /><br />Nice product, and for FREE!
0142421715|5.0|The book I ordered was 'Crossed' by Ally Condie. I bought this book as 'new' with many offers. It came in pretty good condition. The pages were a bit bent, but it was in good condition, with minimal damage.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|I gave this 3star because it was a good idea to make it a dictionary but I  like big kids book with no pictures I can't even read your dictionary.
B005FFW46S|5.0|Rereading Sir Terry's books - mainly the Sam Vines books as they are my favorite. Love to read the hardcovers, but travelling you can't beat a kindle - and reading discworld?  You can't stop at one!

B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's a good game in that, it requires the use of your brain. It's not just some basic stupid blinking lights game
0525952926|5.0|This is the second book of the &#34;Century&#34; trilogy. The first one, Fall of Giants, was excellent and this one is absolutely riveting. It is over 900 pages long but I became so immersed in it that I finished it in 3 days. In it you find out everything that led to the second World War, from the rise of the Third Reich, the invasion of Poland and the hesitations of the British government that led to such disastrous results. You meet in it some the characters from the first volume. The book vividly describes the cruelty of war and in truth you wonder how people were able to survive it. It is immensely valuable from a historic point of view and it is difficult to imagine that the third volume may surpass this one in interest, but, with Ken Follett, it is not impossible.
B009JBZH54|5.0|APART FROM NOT TOO MANY SPECIAL FEATURES THIS SET LOOKS OUTSTANDING ON BLU RAY. IT TURNED MY TV INTO A WINDOW THAT HAS A VIEW OF GOTHAM CITY AS I FELT LIKE I WAS WATCHING EVERY MOVIE FOR THE FIRST TIME.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Some of the floor are a little to easy but a few so far make you think a little bit more. Overall game is a lot of fun
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|Moves slowly in the beginning.A sleeper compared to The Wizard of Oz. My eyes wouldn't stay open. Unsurprisingly boring! A sleeper
0767810856|5.0|Everything was great. Thank you very much! I have no complaints about anything whatsoever. The movie was on time and everything it said it would be.
B00BMT9SQA|4.0|A great portrayal of an adult relationship between a mother and a son. Shows how minor events can live in hearts forever.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|i can't stop playing this game!!! the graphics and sounds she magnificent the best mobile video games I've seen ever i think this is the best games on the appstore I'm planning this on my kindle there is no problems is great i recommend it to anyone
B0050DIWFC|5.0|We need to question ourselves if we know always children and if our love for them impaired us to identified mental illness or behavioral problems. As a mother, grandmother and teacher I enjoy and learn a lot for reading this book.
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|I thought I was ordering the charger cable with a 110 connection instead of USB.  Its usable but somewhat inconvenient for us.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|The price is right for this handy backpack to hold more gear than my other camera bags, even my lovely Kelly Moore bag, which  I wish I could return now.  I thought of getting another for my son.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|The production of this album is BEYOND amazing!  New sound!  Fresh lyrics - not to mention some pretty controversial stuff, but I don't expect anything less from Kanye!!
0307950654|2.0|In a nut shell it is not much of a mystery novel. Short synopsis for Pride and Prejudice fans-Wikham is a accused of murdering his friend on Pemberly property.  He is arrested and tried for the murder.  The other characters mainly sit around and worry - Darcy worriesthat his family honor will be besmerched, Elizabeth worries she'll be stuck with Lydia, and Lydia worries about her husband, I presume because no one much bothers about her.  No one slueths although Darcy's sister Georgianna and her lawyer suitor might have made charming dectives but they don't do anything either.  Finally an improbable solution is arrived at and everyone lives happily ever after.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|I love this movie. It is funny as well as dramatic and heartwarming at times. I have read several reviews which criticize the acting. I think the casting of characters was perfect. I could go into detail about each actor and why he/she fits the part, but I don't want to spoil the storyline for anyone who has not yet viewed the movie.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed watching the story unfold and then fitting the pieces of the puzzle together as they relate to the original \\"Wizard of Oz\\" movie. I've watched it twice and look forward to watching it again.<br /><br />My children are 11,9, and 7. There were some intense scenes with the witch's baboons and the witches, but when I paused the movie and asked if anyone wanted to stop watching, the answer was a resounding \\"No!\\"<br /><br />The only negative comment I will make is concerning language. I realize that most people are not offended by the word dam*, but it is used in the beginning of the movie and is quite unnecessary. We enjoy family friendly movies and I never understand the need to add at least one expletive in a movie that can do without it.<br /><br />I would not recommend this movie for young children unless you view it first and determine your child will not be afraid. My children who are a little older, thought it was great.<br /><br />I love the classic storyline of good versus evil. Sleeping Beauty is one of my favorites. If you enjoy a little humor and romance mixed with a lot of action, then this movie is for you. Enjoy!
B0007N1BBC|5.0|This is a fanastic version of North & South. The intensity of Richard Armitage is palpable and exciting.<br />I understand there are other versions, but this is the one you want.  This is a region 2 DVD, so be care-<br />ful , but my computer will easily switch back and forth.  A+++
B0016CJNS6|5.0|This album was a ground-breaking release for a great rock band at a time when most music was stale. Any casual Stones fan would do well to make this purchase.
B008XBCJ34|3.0|Movie = 1 star.  Effects, picture, 3D quality = 5 stars.  Overall I give it a 3 star rating.  Strip the visuals away and you have another same old formula movie and not even a good one among those.  If you have 3D you need to at least rent this as it is pretty impressive, even without 3D the blu ray is pretty impressive.
B00080ZG10|5.0|This 2 DVD set of \\"The Aviator\\" is very good value especially with the second DVD and its heaps of extras I have placed them together with the film \\"Hells Angels\\" that I have also purchased.<br />Some of the extras on DVD 2 cover the compulsion disorder that brought Hughes down.<br />I had this disorder mostly as a teenager in the 1960's in a minor way and like Hughes undiagnosed then and I suppose now as I never sought assistance<br /> I managed mostly to work through it using as it is said in the films extras \\"mindfullness\\".<br />Perhaps Hughes could not work his way through it because he could not give up ?<br />he could not bail out of a plane I do not know what his opinion was of parachutes but it seems he never used one.<br />There is a time that I needed to check on my door 2 or 3 times to believe it was actually closed,<br />but I got through that by telling myself the door was closed and contolling myself from turning around and giving in to the mindtricks.<br />perhaps Hughes could not put his own set of controls in place and in the end all that baggage took its toll it is a great shame that such a clever man could not figure a way out of that maze of his own making by using his mind as he had so much still to offer.
B00BEZTMWW|2.0|I have watched once in 3D and once in 2D.  I really want to think it is a good movie but it isn't.  Maybe it is me but seems like an another not so epic journey that fails to keep my interest.  3D didn't really add much over standard blu ray in my opinion.  I think they just keep cranking out these movie franchises and they get ho hum after a while.  Our under rated lovable hobbit defies the odds...blah blah blah.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was so addicting!!Sat down and played the whole thing. Can't wait for more levels to come. Hope it is very very soon
B002ZG98UK|3.0|The movie itself is nothing special but in 3d it really shines.  Several scenes are real standouts in 3d and worth watching for that reason alone.  I couldn't see liking this much in standard 2d viewing.
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|Wonder why the two main characters don't sound like any other people in the movie, when they were suppose have grown up near this town?<br /><br />Not so good
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It rekindled vivid memories of Nigeria, and gave voice to the pain and depression experienced when one becomes trapped between cultures and can't &#34;go home&#34; again.  This was a joy to read.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|Very spine tingling. The scenes where it shows mama is very creepy. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes these kind of movies.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Pretty awesome game. Some levels arecreally tricky and you need to pay close attention. Just wish there was a help button for when you get stuck
B0098VXMNE|5.0|Im not a writer. And so many people i will not be naming all of them, or all the writers or directors.  Simply put. If you can handle blood, lots of sword fighting, very graphic violence and sex?  Then there is a chance you will love this. That stuff aside, it is about what we all try to enjoy today. Our freedom. Braveheart was the same theme.  Gladiator to a degree the same.  Rome is using people as slaves in gladiator games and hurting and killing them and their families.  Then Spartacus starts a revolution and thousands and thousands of former slaves join his cause. Spartacus had a wife.  The Man in charge of the gladiators killed his wife. it takes him a season to realize it. Then all hell breaks loose and it begins.  Spartacus: Gods of the Arena.  That is a must see.  It is what happened before Spartacus arrived.  The person who was spartacus passed away sadly. Then they had to find the right replacement. while doing so, they made &#34;Gods of the Arena&#34;.  Spartacus Vengeance is just perfect.  It took a while to get use to the new spartacus.  They do look alike so it is really the way they approach the character that separates the two. I loved this series and i just wish they would have gone on for another season or two. If you don't mind violence and almost soft porn sex, you can enjoy the plot, and sub plots and what sparacus is trying to do for his people. He wants freedom for all. And they fight for it.  I did not do this justice.  But i say give this a try.  But you need to start with the first one, then gods of the arena, then Vengeance, then War of the damned.  Four seasons.  And to me the best of top five best series of all time.  You cant go wrong trying it.  I gave you a very short version. You could write pages on what this is about and what they have done.  Im not that good. But the series is.....

0062255657|4.0|`The Ocean at the End of the Lane' is a fairy tale, yet one in which all of the characters, even those who are immortal or monstrous, are well-rounded and driven by their own motivations. Gaiman captures the elusive experience of childhood in this clever little book.<br /><br />Read my full review at http://www.popmythology.com/the-ocean-at-the-end-of-the-lane-review/.
0385341008|5.0|My aunt--a sci fi/fantasy reader--recommended this book to me three years ago, and it has sat on my shelf ever since. I was skeptical of the content (another British war story?) and confused about why my aunt had liked it so much, when our overlapping taste has basically been for awesome epic fantasy novels. Finally got around to reading it on a plane, and NOW I GET IT. So witty, heartwarming, and heartbreaking all at once. It didn't help that I flipped to the back and read the author bios before getting very far into the book--learning that Mary Ann Shaffer passed away before the book made it into print, and that she'd been waiting her whole life to tell the story, definitely ratcheted up my blubbery side even more.<br /><br />Anyway. Highly enjoyable read, and one you'll come out of feeling better about the world. I recommend it.
B00009YOQW|5.0|I'm so happy I bought this for my daughter.  It really is a lovely drum that feels like it will last forever. It's kind of a xylodrum, since it's cuts create 3 different sounds.  The sound is so pleasant.  I could really play with it all day....ok, the truth is I like it more than my 1 year old, but I'm sure she will do more than suck on the stick eventually.
B000UJCALI|5.0|It is one of those classic horror films that many years later is still very scary, disturbing and original. It is very well acted by Jack Nicholson and the rest of the cast including Shelley Duvall. The plot contains all you want from a horror film and never let's up. If you love horror films than look no further than this timeless horror classic.  This is a must see and should be part of your collection!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|challenging game it is a great game to pass the time with can also be addicting wish there were helps but overall great game
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really enjoy the game. Gets you to think and problem solve. Keep up the great guys. Looking forward to more.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Am 75% through the book and am very disappointed.  The book started out ok but got boring because of slow or no storyline.  Maybe all the hype on the book had me expecting too much.  Not a book that I just can't put down.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Super fun and entertaining! Really makes you use your problem solving skills. I loved this game and will tell my friends about it.
B00B7ERH04|2.0|I downloaded this solely for the camera timer.  Worked great at first, then when I tried to used it later, it started prompting me for \\"cam coins\\"...I'm not paying just to be able to use my phone's camera.  I deleted and dowloaded Say Cheese instead.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|I usually rent movies before I decide to buy.  I bought this movie hoping that it would be worth it.  It was a great movie awesome special effects and will go into my movie binder as a classic that I will watch over and over, well worth the money!
B0085YOD1A|4.0|My battery lasts longer since installing the app. I recommend you still lower the brightness and lock the screen rotation on the Kindle Fire HD for longer use. I've been using battery Pro for about a week now and my device has never gone below 50% battery on normal use.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|I love the book and now the movie. It was really nice to play my English class after the story.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|I love this movie was such a sweet and loving story. The movie came in great condition and super fast.
B00CFA222M|4.0|I enjoyed this film and the action. The Giants were larger than life and one minded on eating all of  us!
B004E2XAFW|4.0|Compared to their earlier work, this album falls a bit short. It lacks the grace, gravitas, and power (along with a host of other words that will make me sound smart if I use them) of their earlier works. It's a lot more pop-oriented, but it's still definitely a Within Temptation album when you listen to it. Plus, the story's good.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you won't accept anything but their old stuff, you won't like this album. If you're open to something new and a little different, then it's a great buy. Don't necessarily buy this as your first WT album if you've never heard their work, but it does make a good addition to their repertoire.
B005LAIH2C|3.0|Hansel & Gretel was ok, but I think it could have been better. So I hope they will do better on the NEXT one ?
B00275EGX8|5.0|Before purchase I read other reviews and somewhat shocked. Some reviews read more like a movie critic,( wrong uniforms, wrong equipment,etc. Well after 30 years of law enforcement and while watching police movies I don't comment on the technical stuff as I know Hollywood made the movie and the are selling entertainment. This movie was exciting, enlightening, and well played and I can say that because I was also in Vietnam Nam. Before you criticize this movie watch one from the 1950's.
B00846REIS|5.0|I honestly loved this series better than the fifty series! I love how the writer grabs ahold of you and keeps you reeled in till the end!
B00821OX98|4.0|I wasn't ready for a show like this just yet. Still not too bad! Quality is good for a television show!
B000OCXIDK|4.0|The Girl with a Pearl Earring, offered me a view into a period and place in history about which I knew almost nothing.  the story is engaging and the characters well drawn.  I am sure it is romanticised, despite much about the story that is quite un-romantic. the ending seemed rather pat.  It reflects one possibility for the haunting quality of Vermeer's painting.  Seeing the painting at the deYoung Museum in San Francisco shortly after reading the novel, brought several other possibiblities to mind.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|So fun!  Had a blast trying to beat this game.  Definitely mind boggling!<br />Would recommend this to anyone looking for a challenge.  DON'T USE THE HINTS!
B001NLKXK2|4.0|This is a well written, poignant story of the awful progress of Altzheimers disease.  Ms. Genova describes well the variety of responses of the people in Alice's life.  Alice comes alive as an intelligent fighter against the inevitable destruction of her remarkable mind.  I cried and I laughed.
B0083Z614S|4.0|I really liked how it ended. Some parts dragged a little with the whole garden theme everyday but I really enjoyed the book as a whole piece.
B00BWJ91XK|5.0|My only bitch about this movie is that it should have been released before the trilogy. This is a must read for your children, especially in print, and as a movie it delivers on every level on a scale that only someone who truly loves the story could tell.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Lindsey Stirling is an out standing violin artist. Some of the tracks have background music which is somewhat overwhelming ...., but her solos are awesome.....
B002LMV7TS|5.0|I love this product and would recommend this to everyone.  The price is so much less and comes in fast.  Our family loves this product and use it often!
B00637HXNG|2.0|THE CONCERT WAS PRETTY GOOD BUT THE 3-D WAS TERRIBLE!!!  THE MUSIC WAS SUFFICIENT BUT MORE OF THE BIG HITS WAS NEEDED
B0042FZOFU|5.0|I love this product and would recommend this to everyone.  The price is so much less and comes in fast.  Our family loves this product and use it often!
B005NPCUC8|5.0|This is a triumph of an album. Ground-breaking, awe-inspiring, jaw-dropping; to name a few. Through the cycle of life we go and it really speaks to you more and more as you continue to listen.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I'm surprised I'm saying this, but this book was not what I expected. All the other books kept my interest all the way through. I found this book boring at times.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great summer reading with fully developed  characters.  Each chapter is in the voice of one of the characters so you deal with many points of view
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|A colorful and engaging game with recognizable characters from the animated movie. Both children and adults enjoy building the kingdom.
B0014KA0EG|5.0|i probably haven't listened to this in ten years.  it is as relevant and current as it was 20 years ago.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Had a great time problem solving with my 6 yr old son. We really loved playing this game together and couldn't put it down until we solved all 10 available levels. More please!
B001OQCV2E|5.0|Bought this cd because we have dish networks and in the middle of the movie it went down so we never seen the hole movie great pic
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|This game would have to be one of the best games I have ever seen and played. I just wish you had more time to play<br /> :) I would totally recommend this game.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It is awesome<br />It is a book of Awesomeness it truly spoke out to me because it is truly awesome
B004CRR9G0|5.0|I have loved this Miyazaki movie for a long time, but honestly, i always thought the price of the Disney bluray to be a bit high. Thankfully a few went on sale with the release of Howl's Moving Castle so i bought a few.<br />The Audio and video are clean and sharp, but this movie is showing it's age. That  being said, its still great and thoroughly entertaining. A must see for anime fans.
B005HSL626|5.0|Best game ever I like how you could buy the blades with star fruit and you don't have to buy the star fruit with real money or you can do the challenges to unlock the blades and backgrounds
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|As a child I have fond memories of watching that crazy Doctor who jumps into a police box and zooms off to different planets and times doing all sorts of mischief.<br />And now here he is again, re-imagined for a new world, so many years later, and different from before.<br />As an adult, I think Doctor Who is the definition of compulsive viewing, and this season was no different.
B008518MOW|5.0|Its a nice movies in 3D,<br />Good for home entertainment.<br />Worth buying, but of course, if the price is around USD10-15
1476719071|4.0|So after many nights of a good book friend of mine about how good these are, I finally got to these two with excitment of the reads ahead. The story is well written with some twsts and turns that flow nicely but aren't the typical obstacles.<br /><br />Abby - is escaping a past that we don't really learn about for a while, and even then its enough to come to your own conclusions. She has come to Eastern with her friedn to began a new start in life until she meets Travis. Much of the book is her self-doubting herself and the two of them chasing one another trying to make it work.<br /><br />Travis was a bit violent for my liking, I feel like every chapter there was an unneccessary amount of violence, whether it was provoked or not. Beyond that he sounds like a total hunk, and his heart was in the right place.<br /><br />The secondary characters were all a nice play-in and meshed well with the storyline.<br /><br />Overall the book and teh writing had me hooked and reading quickly. I finished both books in a day and a half, and not for lack of content. I felt liek it fell short in the end though, wanting a bit more to their HEA that I ended up getting in WD.
B008UZ7MUI|5.0|Its a really nice movie in 3D<br />Nice 3D effect,<br />Good for home entertainment...<br />But you need to keep watching Harry Potter series in order to know whats going on in the movie...<br />I say, its worth buying....
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|We are huge NASA & Lego fans so when this came out it was a must on our list - it was definietly worth it.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Its the best 3D movies from the first time I've seen it in the theatre.<br />Its got the best 3D effect and a very good storyline.<br />Definitely worth buying for collection.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|The most beautiful love story I have ever read, in tune with modern thinking but some old fashioned values as well. I sobbed when Ana was heartbroken and cried for Christian's emotional distance. A wonderful trilogy that I will re-read for years to come.
B009MO5G90|5.0|Its really a nice movie in 3D,<br />Good for home entertainment.<br />But the price is still a bit expensive, will be better if amazon could sell cheaper
B008QE9XD2|5.0|Never saw the original Dark Shadows, don't want to.  I only saw part of this film in black and white (cuz that's all my tv will play, need to get a new one). But I already love it.  I love the music and the way it's filmed.  I think Johnny Depp is at his ultimate best when he does stuff with Tim Burton.  He looks awesome in this movie, there is definately the gothic aspect which is fantastic.  Michelle Phiffer is cool, she usually picks good movies.  Can't wait to see this in colour!
B004LWZW6U|2.0|The quality of the 3D in this movie isn't very good...<br />I don't think its worth buying it in 3D
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I will carry the memory of this book with me for some time.  Ms. McKenna has written words that feed and satisfy the soul.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Its a nice 3D movies.<br />Great for home entertainment.<br />Worth buying, but if only they could lower the price a bit more....
B007VUCAVO|5.0|The battery pro works great so far.I don't know much about computers but this product works for me.I wish the kindle battery worked as well.I charge the battery at night before bed and in the morning with kindle shut off half the battery is drained already.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I read alot of books, this is best one i have ever read, very moving true story highly recommended to anyone!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game! Superb graphics and keeps you thinking. Wish it was longer - sure hope they make more levels. Get it - you will love it!
B0083Z614S|5.0|I wish I wouldn't have waited so long to read this! A great story with highly memorable characters. I'd recommend it to anyone
B006GWO5NE|1.0|It didnt charge my kindle at all. I've had it for only 2 years and not it wont charge at all.
0316227706|5.0|Underwater Dogs had amazinging photographs that were hilarious. It was definitely a great table book to look at, and the product was phenomenal. The sellers said it was used, but it truly looked brand new. I would totally recommend this book to anyone.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|If you like playing uno with family and friends, you will like playing it on your kindle. It is fun and sometimes a challenge.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I thank it is my fav sonic I have u should sell more of dr. who toys and thank you
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|The game is great until you get bored with it it gets to easy when you know how to play
B0027Z5DK8|5.0|Adam Sandler is funny and my kids wanted to see this and it didn't let them down. They laughed and enjoyed it.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|You have to be smart and tricky to be able to play this game so keep practicing so that you can get better.
B00BY1F8UQ|5.0|Keith Jarrett's trio in great, great shape shows why they are one of the biggest standards and jazz players of all the times.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|One of the very few apps I found that is not compatible with my tablet. I use Kindle for PC and and iPhone and all good. So I wanted to use it on my tablet too and it does not work with my Android tablet.
B00DF0POXA|1.0|Terrible songs, arrogant singer.  If you're good decent humans, you should not listen to this kind of music, a lot bad words in his songs which prove that he's not a decent person. I would not allow my kids to listen to these kind of vulgar words in his music. What kind of talentless person who declares himself as God?  God will punish you for this! Shame on you, Kanye West!
B006KYFF7I|1.0|Why does the Kindle edition cost more than TWICE as much as the paperback and almost the same as the hardcover?<br />Greedy!
B004KPX4W2|1.0|This is a very stupid movie.  Very predictable. Good actors but not worth it.  I couldn't wait to finish it.  It was that bad.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|I'm thrilled to have found this via the Amazon warehouse, so I saved a few bucks.  The case was cracked on one edge, but the discs and all contents are fine.  I honestly think this is George Clooney's best movie.  It gets funnier and more enjoyable with each viewing.  It's a must-have for any Wes Anderson fan.
B005MLOOJA|3.0|Not bad for the first tv show I've seen in a long, long while, but won't come back for more.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is a great history eraser.... it's easy to use just hit one button and it tells you all that it did
159448385X|5.0|I have purchased copies of this book ( and even shared my own) for some of my friends, and they have all enjoyed it greatly. Very enlighting.
031237593X|5.0|All I'd hoped for in a novel about Richard III.  Well researched, beautifully written. I ordered the novel on a suggestion from a friend and his father.  I'm not disappointed.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|This movie was awesome in the fact that it goes from black and white to color and had a great story line.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun game with many different challenges. I really like this game but do not put it on your cloud because you will lose the progress and level. I'm just saying! Nice for the entire family.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game for people looking for a good horse app for any device. It uses simple controls and wonderful for people of all ages
0385347774|5.0|Outstanding!  I constant surprise around every corner.  Literally could not put this down.  Her best novel yet and hopefully more to come.
B001DRF84W|3.0|This was a good movie so to speak but it was too depressing for my 9 and 14 year old kids.
0307341550|5.0|If you've read her other books you'll like this one.  Wonderful who-dun-it with interestingly flawed characters.  Love those small town murders.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Piano and cello who would have guessed.  This compilation is beyond great.  The tempos and electronic augmentation to the cello rips are just awesome.  And if you're not blown away by the music then wait till you see the eye candy provided in the accompanying DVD videos.  Highly recommended!
B004UID2LC|2.0|ive had this app for 3 months it worked perfectly. but then it just stopped working. when I go to download a video it just says searching and never says its downloading.please fix this app. until then I guess I have to find a new app like this one(which I'm not having good luck with)
B0041KWS9Q|1.0|I could not get it this movie to play.  When I looked at the back to read the description, it was in a foreign language which I did not expect.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|I loved it! I watched it over and over. I will be buying this movie in blue-ray. It would be great if it came in 3-d!
B006Y5H74W|4.0|I really enjoy this show. The songs are magical, the singing is phenominal and I really enjoy the storyline. I just wish I had known about it while it was on the air.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|Great realism.  The best fliers app I've found. An added bonus is the attion to detail in the planes.  Great for military history buffs.
B000I9YX06|5.0|What a great movie! Good acting. Love the fact that all the really intense scenes are also so well done. I like that we get all the fighting and action but not gore or blood..?! Makes it so fun. Will Smith delivers these great comedic lines perfectly.
B00CM96A60|1.0|I can't download the MP3 CD I purchased even though I installed the crap Amazon player.  What kind of stupid piece of crap is this?  Where is my @#$##$% download?  Why can't I download it now?
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I would actually give this a 4.5 due to the ending of the last movie but I couldn't figure out how to do a half rating.  It's much better than a 4!  The Blu-Ray versions of the first three movies are OK but the fourth one is really well done.  Having said that ... I guess it still gets better than a four because I like the plots of the movies so much!
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I have only just begun playing it. It's not the best Mahjong I have played. Maybe it'll get better. The opening boards are too easy. Also the graphics are not as colourful & bright as I would like for my old eyes. being able to make the tiles bigger would've been nice .
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book was thought provoking and very well written. I highly recommend it for fans of Sci-Fi, Dystopian, Fantasy and other suspenseful fiction genres.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|Ferriss offers many routes for people to achieve their goals, delineating everything from simple hacks to workouts that are with world class trainers. Worth a read, some sections optional if not applicable.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|I love Daily Workouts because a new workout is always at my fingertips!  The written screen instructions are clear and the demonstration allows me to see the correct way to do each exercise.  I love the variety, I can work a different body part or do a different type of exercise every time I access the app.  Great app!
B009UX2YAC|2.0|This last update, I can't connect to facebook anymore. I can't see the list of my friends that is playing this game, and their scores. Please fix.
B00CSJOO8K|4.0|Good quality download.  no pixilating.  good resoultion.  I love this show...Laughted so much.  rewatched.  Hope you enjoy it as well.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|My kiddo loves this movie she watches it every day. You can learn a lot from this movie. Great product.
B00CSKZI2A|5.0|I only bought this cuz I missed the finale (dang those family get togethers lol) No really, it was a great episode.  The resolution was geat and never pixcelated  once (I so hope I spelled the correctly :) )  I can't wait for the next season to find out what happens.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app is great when you are on the go or not! I really like this because if I forget my kindle I can still read it off my phone.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series.  It is well done and always keeps my interest.  I love looking at the the estate.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I've been waiting for a game like this for ages. Please just give us more levels as soon as possible. It's brilliant! Love it!!!
B000R7I3LY|5.0|What a great mix of tunes on this CD, some I haven't heard and should really be on the radio. My favorite (at the moment) is Gravity. I LOVE her voice!
B00AH6CCK8|5.0|This is over 13+ years old, but I never got around to hearing it.  After getting the concert on Netflix, I had to get the album.  The combination of the SF symphony and electric guitar is a great sound and Metallica's performance is incredible.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Was pleasantly surprised to get this series available for free on Prime. Had a good time watching it.<br />Nicely made series. Looking forward to the next season to be available on Prime :)
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Very disappointed! I loved the 1st 2 but I don't think I will be purchasing the 4th book. The 3rd was very disappointing
B00005JKGK|5.0|Very interesting storyline weaving the experiences of three Chinese American immigrant women and their three American born daughters in the US.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|I know this app cost money but it's worth it if your looking for a really fun app. The only thing I wish they would add is where you can customise the person before you do their hair. But other then that, it's a very fun app.
B008M0NDOK|1.0|The controller works well, but only works on 8 games and there are no future plans to add new games or update compatibility. It's really disappointing when these mobile game companies make something well, try to charge a ton of money ( this was originally $80!!!) , lower it to a reasonable price, sell a bunch and games and make money, and then decide not to support their product for what ever reason. Will never waste my money on another gameloft component or app.
B003QSMCKO|5.0|Great movie! My family watched it all together and it was so funny and cute yet showed a good moral.
B007N85POS|4.0|I now have tried 4 of the free Angry Birds. Hate Space, like all the rest. Rio is good, but I always hate when you get to a level where you almost HAVE to buy extras to finish it. I do not have Wi Fi all the time, so even if I was tempted (not) I would not be able to get the extras. Not even really sure how to use the ones they give for free occasionally. Just make the levels tough but doable!
B003ZD9DUC|5.0|i bought this for my son.  excellent picture and sound.  disc arrived before the promised date.  very happy with this.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Hated Angry Birds Space. This one is very fun. Just started it and already it makes me laugh. There a little wormholes you can send the birds through that puts them in completely different parts of the game. Leads to some unusual outcomes!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Great game, feels like I'm playing against a friend who's really good at the game. I appreciate the undo button so I can learn and experiment instantaneously. Cool graphics too.
1608862801|4.0|I bought enough of these books.  Maybe it should be for kids 4-5 year old because it just doesn't have enough story/reading.  My son liked it-YES, but I thought it had more reading.
B00B5A9FLY|3.0|I was so disappointed in the final ending.  They should have brought it to a happy ending instead of leaving the series with a sad ending.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Another masterpiece by Stephen King, he has a way of taking your hand and bringing you into the world he has created. He makes it so easy to get lost in the story and get attached to the characters. This is ultimately a love story of the most touching and heart breaking kind... left me in tears.
B00B0X4PIO|2.0|After loving Hosseini's previous two novels, I was anticipating this one so much because of the promise of a strong connection between a brother and sister. Out of all his books, this is the relationship that I knew I could relate to the most as I have a younger sister and I was hoping to have a really strong emotional connection with the characters and the story.<br /><br />The book started out great. Based on the first chapter, i thought this would end up similar to his previous two books, but after Abdullah and Pari's story ended and we had a new set of characters to learn about and deal with, I got confused. Will we come back to Abdullah and Pari's story? As I carried along the chapters, all I got were different character arcs.<br /><br />Each chapter just felt like a new short story. A new set of characters to learn about, a new storyline, a new setting, a new timeframe. Each chapter essentially made me start from scratch and the beginning of each would just be a new sense of confusion as I learned new names and new storylines. By the time I finally starting getting comfortable with the chapter and somewhat connecting with the characters, the storyline ends and we go to a new chapter to start the process all over again.<br /><br />The first half I actually enjoyed, but the second half all went downhill. Based on reviews, I actually skipped Markos' chapter about Greece based on how people were saying it was completely useless to the story and a chore to read through. Finishing the novel, I think I made the right choice as there were no connections to Markos.<br /><br />Wanting to read more about Abdullah and Pari, we only then get back to them when they are both really old. There just wasn't an emotional connection for me between them because so much time has passed since we last read about them, that I basically forgot all the little details that made me enjoy the first chapter.<br /><br />Overall, I felt like this book was just a set of short stories. The chapters didn't connect very well with each other and I just got the impression that Hosseini wanted to try something new, but it just didn't work. After wanting to experience the deep emotional connections between a brother and sister, but then not really getting this experience, it left me feeling very disappointed.<br /><br />Luckily, I only read this on my commute back home from work on the bus, so I didn't have to waste any of my free time at home. If so, I would've given this book 1 star for the fact that it even wasted my own time. When you feel a sense of dread to finish reading through a book, that's when you know it isn't worth it, but I stuck through to the end, and the final result didn't live up to my expectations. So disappointed :(
B00DF0POXA|4.0|Think of how 808s is different. Still dissecting it. But def grows on you. Four stars because damn Kanye, only 45 minutes? Really, really short.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Probably the best film showing how a person addicted to drugs and alcohol can lie and manipulate friends and co-workers to hide his flaws.  Brilliant acting on the part of Denzel Washington.
B00D6OV57O|4.0|Zimmer's new theme is a worthy successor to John Williams' legendary score.  Some of the smaller tracks are a bit slow, but you'll want to listen to the main theme over and over again!
0765334798|5.0|REVIEWED: Redshirts<br />WRITTEN BY: John Scalzi<br />PUBLISHED: January, 2012<br /><br />On its face, Redshirts, by John Scalzi, is a successful story. Mirroring the Star Trek show, Redshirts creates an alternative explanation as to why crewmembers aboard the \\"Intrepid\\" regularly seem to die off for no reason. Geeky science fiction which is part comedic satire, part adventure, and part existential philosophy.  The majority of the book (comprising about the first 85%) is a quick read, fun and fast-paced. Then Scalzi adds in three codas or \\"P.S.\\"s, afterwards, each which builds another level to the story. It's really a unique structure which I've not seen commonly done, but he pulls it off and the book is increasingly better with the advancement of each of the codas. Great ending that tied everything together.<br /><br />Five out of Five stars
B009M4KTEM|4.0|For a while, I was wondering if this was even going to be released! When this first went up for pre-order on the Jerry site, it's release date was to be months sooner than when it was actually released. Then, after several delays we were told that it would be a \\"bit longer\\" but promised MP3 downloads by a certain date so we could at least listen to it. It didn't happen. Finally, we were able to here the Sugaree and a final release date was set.<br /><br />This show was recorded on multi-track tape as were several others before this. The late show was broadcast over the radio way back when. The night before has already been released [[ASIN:B0002XEDOE After Midnight: Kean College 2/28/80]]. The show opens with Sugaree just like the night before and I think I like this one better. The sound quality is very good, although once again, Ozzie's electric piano is way to low in the mix. Actually, the Jerry Garcia Band never had the big set lists that the Dead did. This means that pretty much any two shows from a certain era are going to be pretty close, set list wise. If you look at the song list from this and the night before, you'll notice a lot of repeats. Overall, I think I still like the night before a little better but this is certainly good too. I can't help but wonder with these shows being recorded on multi-track, if Jerry wasn't considering a live release at the time.
0753541637|4.0|Many of the instances described in the book is something most everyone would have faced it in their lives. The suggestions are very practical.
0425166805|5.0|It felt good to read a book that left me thirsting for more and make me wonder what else has not been uncovered and what a big difference knowing this sooner in life, how much ore creative would I have been
B000FCK65W|5.0|This is my favorite book of all time. Such a fantastic look at the human spirit and survival in the face of adversity.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Amazon works very hard on the updates they give us,usually the IOS devices get the bad updates but amazon will surely get a better update. Just give them a chance :)
B00CKZX0AA|4.0|Many of the negative reviews of this sountrack repeat that it's not John Williams' original Superman score. It seems they're less upset about the music itself, and more that it's not THAT music.<br /><br />Personally, I like a bit of over-the-top bombasticism (don't think that's a word, but whatever) from my scores. If that sort of thing is to your taste, this is worth the investment. Or at least the 99 cents for track 17 \\"What are you going to do...\\" etc. A lot of folks have compared itto Zimmer's \\"Batman\\" scores. While they both definitely have core similarties, I always felt as though the \\"Batman\\" scores were always too restrained. It always felt like a proper bit of action music or a motif was just dying to break out, and it never really did.<br /><br />\\"Man of Steel,\\" however, does allow itself to go full-blown. One review lamented its having a \\"two-note\\" theme, but this just acts as a rising core that everything builds around. In the more action-driven sequences, this builds into a mad peak or blasting percussion, quick bursts from the strings, and occasional choral accompaniment. It resists the urge to do sweeping violins etc as we've all come to expect from Superman music. It's new but still distinct never feeling too muc like bland, generic action-movie music.<br /><br />This is not to say that the music from the quieter sequences is not lovely. It even borders on a tad haunting in the opening track, when a quick dash of choral work pops in rather unexpectedly. Gave me a bit of a chill the first time I was listening, that. In these bits, for obvious reasons, the percussion takes more of a backseat to gentler works from the strings, and it's really rather lovely and often a little melancholy. All in all, terrific stuff.
B00CKJ2KK2|3.0|I can't get through the login of the game and I don't want to delete it because it might work again and I might have to go through the long download. Please fix or update it!
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|This games is nothing like playing in the arcade, the physics in it fell completely off and over all its really just not fun to play.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|A real page turner. Could not put it down. Loved the ending. I had a real empathy for the main character.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I got this because my girlfriend kept talking about it and I wanted to share a common interest with her, unfortunately I live in a fraternity house at college and I did not expect the consequences. My brothers picked this up as a joke to start reading it and now everyone is hooked on the series! I didn't even like the book but now everyone won't stop talking about it, sororities don't like coming to our house anymore either since they think its a weird obsession. I just wanted to get back to the days when we were all to frat to care and pounded cheap beer while singing country road.
159463176X|5.0|AND THE MOUNTAINS ECHOED was titled from a William Blake poem. The title was the only thing I didn't love about this book. I loved the characters, the various settings, and the time shifts.<br /><br />Hosseini has matured as a writer since the publication of THE KITE RUNNER.<br /><br />In this new novel, the cast of characters is vast. He interweaves their stories, changes points of view, and uses an interview to expose the way their behaviors affect others.<br /><br />While the book centers on the brother-sister of Abdullah and Pari, separated by their father and uncle, the multitude of other characters tell of their lives as ex-patriot Afghanis or still living through the wars and Narco-wars of that beleaguered nation. There is so much that is beautiful in this book.<br /><br />Besides the themes of family ties, disappointments, and enduring relationships, Hosseini also reflects on the meaning of ownership of land. This theme and that of the bonds between generations make this my favorite of his works.<br /><br />I will leave you will this beautiful quotation: \\". . .she finds behind her eyelids hills that stand soft and a sky that stands high and blue, and the sun setting behind a windmill, and always, always, hazy strings of mountains that fall and fall away on the horizon.\\"<br /><br />Read it once for plot and a second time for beauty.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I could play this for hours or should I say I have played it for hours and never get bored. It's always a challenge to do better next time.
B0091REZMW|4.0|fun game. objects can be hard to find on kindle fire due to size.easy to earn bonuses and upgrades. easy to navigate levels
B00005JG6Q|4.0|Case had a bit of wear and tear, but other than that it was of decent quality.  Movie played fine in the player.
B0094K1PW4|4.0|A good representation of 1950's America and fun way to spent the evening.  The kid actors did a good job.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|would be better as a short story.  The story was good, but not enough material to make a novel.  Glad to have read it
1891252089|5.0|The book warns that the depth of Ashtanga Yoga can not be gleaned from this book (any book); but if you live in the woods in a cabin away from any yogis then its your best chance!  I was injured while snowboarding, but I'm now healed enough to resume my practice with this invaluable tool.
B009PK9SB8|4.0|Even before I bought the LCD, I have used my GoPro on a trip from North Dakota to Florida, and even diving in the carribean. Half of my pictures and videos were useless....very disappointing...but ever since I bought this, my shots are better. The LCD is too small for details but at least I can compose my shots accurately. I rate it at 4 since the battery indicator is not very accurate. It was flashing full then suddenly it became almost empty. Also, it makes the camera thicker that its a little bit uncomfy and heavy to wear it.
B003YFIUW8|3.0|One day I was at brunch with two friends and we started talking about books. My friend mentioned this book and how good it was and the other one agreed. When I heard the concept I was immediately intrigued and bought the book soon thereafter. However, the book isn't that good. To go off what someone said before, you would think this book is good as it is narrated by a child but it just falls short. I am a bibliophile through and through but I have found it difficult to finish this book. While it is somewhat interesting, it just isn't a page turner. Having a 5 (or 6?) yeah old narrator calls for humor but sometimes his inability to perceive what is going on around him is just plain annoying. Now I see why five year olds don't write books.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game. need more levels please. I love figuring out how it all works. writing this review to get more levels is a littlecannoying though.
1439152799|5.0|Fast paced and the story weaves back and fourth from past to present.  Should make a movie out of this book.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game it is all I play it is very fun u should get it its the best
1416550518|5.0|Excellent fast pace read.  One of the best books I've read by this Author so far.  Wish they would make a movie out of this super book.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is a fast paced fun game!  It teaches eye-hand coordination with the mind thrown in!  So much to look at - so much to respond to!  Definitely not the game to play just before trying to wind down to go to sleep!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Students who love to read and students who struggle to read will both enjoy this book.  The excellent information is presented in a way that every can learn.
B00181JGI2|5.0|Bizzare, hilarious and totally entertaining! Fun movie to watch.  Would recommend it to anyone looking for brain-candy and different<br /> entertainment.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|I did not get the DVD in the a case, and I think that was mentioned by the seller, but the DVD is in good condition and played perfectly. It is a nice addition to our movie collection.
B00001OH7O|5.0|Where do I start with this album. Its honestly my new favorite and simply an unbelieveable find. If you are looking for something new and great this is it. Best album purchase I have made in the past 5 years. Bowie is at his best and is in the middle of the &#34;Golden 5&#34; which started with TMWSTW and ended with Diamond Dogs. Best cut is the fabulous &#34; Life on Mars&#34;.<br /><br />  I bought this 2 days before driving from Phoenix AZ to Austin TX. A 15 hour trip made fabulous by this find. I put it in my cd player somewhere around Tuscon and did not take it out over the next 9hrs. I still remember driving through the AZ desert with this soundtrack stuck in my head... &#34;Life on Mars&#34; and the early morning AZ/NM desert were the perfect fit!<br /><br />Here's my suggestion ... by this and go on a road trip somewhere...you wont regret it!
B0058W74UY|1.0|Not sure why this APP didn't work on my kindle 8.9 but it didn't!  Had to remove it because it didn't work.  Beware.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|It was fine untill I had to replace my kindle an download the app again an start all over<br />I was at about lvl 61 and had spent real money on the game just to have to start all over.<br />dont really think its worth starting over again<br /><br />Its also to easy to accidently use gems when you dont mean to (shaking trees for coins an end up using gems to buy more land)
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book is super cute! Storyline  is slightly 50 Shade-ish but a definite must read. I would read it again in a heartbeat
B000G1ALRK|5.0|Can't complain at all about Eric Church. I listen to this CD going to and from work, and it never gets old! Fast shipping, and great listening!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love this game. It does take a lot of patience. It would be great if energy restored faster. I have been  playing for months and not spent any money. That's where patience comes in. It is still fun.
630587493X|5.0|I never thought I would cry over a robot. Well acted, well directed, well written and guaranteed to tug at your heartstrings while at the same time giving you a look into the (possible) future. Not just a tearjerker, lots of humor, romance and a cool female robot. A snuggle on the couch with a box of Kleenex kind of movie.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I use this app everyday.  It works well and is easy to use and navigate.  I like staying in touch with my friends.
B000KX0HVY|5.0|Great recordings of his best performances. Even if you already have the songs this is a great CD to listen to a mix of his best work. I highly recommend. But then, I highly recommend anything that is Elvis. [[ASIN:B00CN09G0A Elvis Presley Cultural Icon (Facts, Figures and Fashions)]]
B008KOTNVA|5.0|I really needed this to install a Macbook Pro battery. I also needed various bits for doing laptop and desktop repair. This kit is an all in one in a small package and is the only thing I need when doing upgrades or electronics repairs.
B00D8KNG4Q|5.0|My favorite band since 1997 just keeps getting better. Their incredible musical chemistry as a group shines in this album. I would recommend this album to both longtime fans as well as anyone who thinks of them as those &#34;MMMBop&#34; kids. This was also my first experience purchasing a digital album through Amazon and using the Cloud Player. My new favorite thing - I don't think I'll buy another album anywhere else.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Though I didn't know what I was getting myself into- this game was nothing but a treat. From the moment I began I was addicted!! Great game, I hope there are many more to follow. Graphics were outstanding and fun to look at too.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|WOW!  It just keeps going.  Occasionally l get stuck, but if I keep trying it sorts itself out. This is the puzzle game I've been looking for.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This was a great read. Altho fiction it was based on fact, shocking facts of life in North Korea. The protagonist kept your interest and you were rooting for him. Hard to fathom these people live in such hardship and total control. It was an amazing story, would like to read more by this author.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|for a doctor who fan, this is a great little prop. I am ashamed to<br />say that it took a few mins to figure out how to put the small batteries<br />in. i had to read the directions :(<br /><br />Good quality, very nice toy<br />It is my daughters, I am told that 46 year old dads are not allowed to play with them<br />:)
B004PYDBVM|4.0|Interesting book but after reading the Orphan Master's Son it was a little weak. Still an interesting read about life in North Korea and how difficult life is for these people. We know so little about life there so this gives us a glimpse.
B00466HM28|5.0|Purchased for my son, aspiring rapper, he absolutely loves it! has had a great time mixing his own beats and Amazon had the best price around!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Enjoyed this book. Not quite as good as his past two books but still an interesting story. Different how he tied the stories together. At first I thought it was going to be a group of short stories but they all tied together bringing it to a conclusion.
0061537969|5.0|absoulutly amazing, Enzo is a great character and tells about his life with such detail. Would not recommend for kids under 10 or those who haven't had the talk..
B0095P31L6|5.0|Great movie. Johnny Depp is Rango and is a fast talking BS'er lizard. There are good one liners in this movie too. Where there is nothing else to watch, this is one of our go to movies.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great app if you like to figure things out! i would recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle games! awesome!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Hate the ending!  Love the show.  My favorite character just didn't need to die.  I would love to see something happy happen.
1400052181|5.0|The book only had a few dents here and there. Mailing took less than predicted. Although I have yet to read the book, I believe it will meet my expectations
B005IQZB14|5.0|Wonderful descriptions of the places the author went and how she was feeling.  I really felt that I traveled with her.
B008B3MZMY|5.0|All the great songs across the albums up to Breakfast in America when this concert took place.  Hodgson and Davies (sp?) at their best.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The author does a great job describing the characters and giving us another look into the lives of people in Afghanistan.
B00821OX98|5.0|High Drama, Great Suspense, Great Action Series.<br />Great Actors, good story line. Nice balance between hope and hoplessness in a &#34;end of world&#34; setting.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One book falls into the next and each one gets more interesting than the last  I couldn't stop reading.  Great!
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|I must say I always felt kanye west was a stellar artist and made quality record yet listening t the whole album not even one song blows you away and the beats are wack and the ones who give a 5 star review are stupid because this by far is the worst album of his career. I think Kanye been sipping a little too much public enemy mentality on this record. I get he has some quality punch lines yet the new music is vintage music we become use too. Maybe the reason the critics are in love with this album causes nobody ever listen to a album like this. It's horrible that kanye can craft masterpieces but instead wasted his talent and his genius by releasing a dreadful record.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Inception is very thought provoking as the storyline revolves around questions of reality and the workings of the mind. The violence isn't over the top, and if nothing else you can enjoy two or so hours of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Leo DiCaprio, and Ellen Page ;)
B000I3P3EM|5.0|Well.. for me it is the best movie out of all 6 original movies with captain Kirk. I also LOVE first part &#34;the Motion Picture&#34;.
B00AKO93JK|4.0|It is a nice app....Having good workouts with good details on each workout. Everyone should get this app if they want to do exercise at home.
1426209584|5.0|Really enjoyed reading about this beautiful birds. Saw photos on email but book us so much better. Hard to believe how many photo s were taken. Even more unbelievable .... how they were taken.
068817776X|4.0|Edith Hahn Beer, by living in her own personal code of love and integrity, endured the holocaust in an horrific circumstance. Personal sacrifice, degradation, endurance, fortitude, strength, courage, love: Edith demonstrates amazing resilience and human qualities in the shadow of excruciating fear, intimidation, enslavement, poverty and evil. I found myself asking, 'Would I have even a fraction of her strength in a similar situation?' I hope so.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|This has been on my to watch list for a while, finally got around to seeing it. It's a pretty solid action movie. Goes on the recommend list.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is one of the best games I have ever played. Its fun and the mini games are really fun too.
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|If you liked the Untouchables this one is sort of like Elliott Ness in Los Angeles.  Lots of good action
B00284BMBM|5.0|Great CD, Meaning to all words on the every song....never dissapointed when I put this on<br />This was the first of thiers I had purchased and am looking forward to another!
1451627297|3.0|By now you get the idea of this book's basic premise - a man has the opportunity to go back in time and possibly prevent the Kennedy assassination on 11/22/63.  A neat idea in concept, and I had high expectations from its author.  To be clear, though, Stephen King is a liberal.  A seemingly angry one at that, especially as he gets older.  And his snarky leftist jabs at all things traditional in America, from the late 1950's to the present, serve only as a distraction from what would otherwise be an interesting story.<br /><br />I agree with many of the other reviews that describe this book at bloated, and that it could have been several hundred pages shorter, and more likely to keep the audience's interest.  His depiction of time travel got a little abstract toward the ending, but the audience owes him some amount of license, because after all we are talking about time travel, without a sci-fi premise, or moving faster than the speed of light.  I was concerned that this depiction would go the way of the touchy-feely Celestine Prophecy, but it successfully resisted going in that direction.<br /><br />But after reading the final pages of the plot, there is an AFTERWARD section in which King credits those who helped him with his exhaustive research in getting the facts and details correct, particularly regarding the steps leading up to Oswald's fateful day in Dallas.  While I am all for historical accuracy, King's declaration of his desire to be unerring is undercut by his condescending hyperbole, spread out at regular intervals throughout his novel.  If he had let the audience draw their own conclusions or form their own opinions, King would have demonstrated that even in his later years he still has the ability to remove his own ego from the fascinating stories he has told for decades.  But he couldn't leave well enough alone, and his injection of political commentary served to alienate me.
034580404X|3.0|they did the same things, over and over and over and over again....got boring to read about<br /><br />started to think I was reading this just because it was so hyped up!
B004G0SJU8|5.0|I`ve seen this several times. It is like Ghost in many ways. The content is great although eventually sad. Acting is Super...overall Very likeable story.
B00428ZRFE|3.0|the tempo and her voice has no variations...<br />gets tiresome to listen to if not &#34;mixed&#34; with other artists in between each song
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|Unfortunately, this was worse than I had hoped it to be - even though I expected a fair amount of CG work to be displayed. However, there was so much CG work (about 90%, in my opinion) that it took away from the story itself and led to bad acting.
0399226907|5.0|I love being able to share this book with my babies.  They love it just as much as I did when it was read to me.  The illustrations are wonderful and the story is too cute!
B00BT0ZDF2|1.0|If you are looking for something to help you go to sleep, then this is your movie, drink lots of coffee
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed this game. I liked the concept of the puzzle of finding the clues to solving each level. However I solved all available levels in one sitting.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|For a little bit of history for the person who &#34;doesn't like history&#34;.  This is a great reflection to how things &#34;used to be&#34;.  It has it's funny parts, serious parts & heartfelt moments.  Great book!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I go to this every time I see bad weather out side. it was use to use and down load.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a GREAT game!!! LOVE IT!!! It is the best game ever I can beat my son in this game
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|Full of high energy songs to get you going. I like them all. They make a great companion for your workout. I had never heard Fallout Boy before, and I think that their upbeat, rock sound is very original and refreshing when most of what I hear on the radio is an all-the-same sound of a rapper and diva mashed up together.
0736092269|5.0|It is great and they keep updating it.  the older version was good but this version is much more complete.  Covers men and women well.  Great buy.
B00DF0POXA|4.0|This is a review for Kanye West's new album, Yeezus. In brackets, Amazon put the word explicit--[Explicit]. This labeling system indicates that the contents of this album may bee seen as explicit.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is amazing!! This os from my 9 year old daughter. Since she's not old enough to rate she had me do it for her. Thank you
0061537969|4.0|Very good book, sent in excellent condition.<br />Would highly recommend it!<br />This was recommend by my friend, and I have to agree one of my favs!
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I wanted to add, &#34;...except&#34; because I can't find anywhere in this app to play my favorites or even view my favorites.  Maybe I just haven't found it yet.  I also want to &#34;share to Facebook&#34; and haven't found that yet.  If it's there, I apologize and won't rate the app any less because it works for watching anything I search for.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|whenever i go to play this i just cant stop!its super fun and addictive!i recommend this for anyone looking for a good app!
B00005RDRO|5.0|One of the better movies made by Falk it is really funny & full of double meanings with laughter galore my husband enjoyed it & he is hard to please.
B00947N6UG|5.0|This is a fun film fit for all ages! Everything about it is wonderful with a great cast, fantastic animation, and surprisingly heartfelt characters that you feel a connection almost right away. I never get tired of watching this film and I'm sure a lot of people can agree with me on that too. Rent it or buy it, you won't be feeling disappointed in doing so.
1401225756|4.0|This trade collects issues 1-8 of The Sandman.<br /><br />Despite being a longtime fan of both Neil Gaiman and comics in general I had not read any of his most famous and praised series until now for a variety of reasons, including not usually enjoying horror.  I'm both glad I've finally started The Sandman and that I waited.  Tastes change over time and I don't think I would have enjoyed this nearly as much had I read it years ago.<br /><br />Preludes and Nocturnes is an interesting read, as it's clear Gaiman is experimenting to find the series' voice throughout (something he admits himself in the afterward).  Though atmospheric elements and tone are consistent each issue still has a very different feel to it.  It is a good start though which introduces Dream, his domain, and assorted seemingly important characters and concepts. Even the parts I didn't care for were interesting and well crafted, if a bit too gruesome at times.  There are glimpses of what has made the Sandman so beloved over time but this is clearly just the beginning.  The opening, the visit to hell and the end were my favorites.<br /><br />The art also changes as the series finds its way.  Sam Keith left after issue 5, and I do admit I preferred his art to what followed.  I found Keith's pencils a little more well defined (which is strange given his later work).  All of it is good though, and Dringenberg and Jones' work was already gravitating more towards my tastes by the Death issue so we'll see how it goes.<br /><br />This edition has been recolored since the original publication.  Since this is my first read through I can't compare much, but the coloring here is very good and based on the few pages of comparison I've seen I prefer it to the original.<br /><br />Unique, layered stuff that was beyond revolutionary at the time and still holds up extremely well. From what I understand things only get better from here.  Looking forward to it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Can't wait to see the next season. All the actors were wonderful<br />I like seeing how life changed and how the different generations accepted New things<br />Like electricity and phones and so on. It was subtle but interesting. The stories were<br />very good.
B00005Q45W|4.0|There is too much sameness on this, but the addition of Sharon singing duet enhances Leonard's baritone (monotone?).<br />He has fantastic musicians, such as the ones on his London DVD concert, on which Sharon also appears.<br />I wish he would have used them in a more varied and occasionally uptempo way just to change the pace.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Our entire book club really enjoyed this book!We all thought the author did an great job of weaving the story together! I highly recommend it!
B000002LAC|4.0|No one singer dominates any song, though I think Linda has the superior voice. And their harmonies are excellent.<br />Emily Lou Harris is demure as usual.
B0040UEI3G|5.0|I began listening to the Scarlatti sonatas on Horowitz recordings. I also bought the two complete sets by Ross and Belder on plucked string instruments of various vintages. Zacharias offers 3 discs of studio recordings on piano, and one disc of live performance in different venues and on different instruments, all of the SAME sonata.  As piano recordings the first 3 surpass Horowitz discs.  The style is different though, and while I like it a lot some Horowitz lovers may not.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|Worst version on the kindle fire. This version crashes constantly and the ads are loud even when you've muted the game.  No fun.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My little pony is so much fun.I wish I found out about this game.if you get the game I hope you enjoy the game like I did.<br /><br />Love,Madison
B003TSEL7S|5.0|My friends recommended it to me because I am bevy interested in Greek mythology and fairytales and the first sentence of the book I was hooked
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Excellent game, indeed. The level progression is spot on; increasing in difficulty gradually and appropriately. Looking fwd to additional levels to come, fa` sho`.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is good to have when the weather is bad.  It is also good to have just to know what your local weather is.  You can not always get the true condition from Tv.  So just use the map and see for yourself.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|It's one thing to see images and hear stories about such a tragedy on the evening news reports, and quite another to imagine what it would be like to be a victim.  This movie takes you through that horror via the experiences of one young family.  You feel this family's terror as the tsunami rips them apart, batters them physically, and leaves them strewn about like so much flotsam.  You get to share the horror of being separated, husband from wife and children, with no way to communicate, overwhelmed by the very reasonable fear that your loved ones most likely are dead.  The shock of witnessing unimaginable carnage, and frustration of trying to survive in abject chaos is palpable. The physical devastation is documented on the evening news; this movie brings you up close and personal to the emotional and psychological devastation.  It ends well for this family, but it is not lost on you that they were among the more fortunate.<br /><br />IMHO, the movie could have been tightened up a bit, a number of scenes are drawn out such that they lose their impact.  The acting was generally good.  Watts was better than good. Bottom line: you won't feel cheated spending a few bucks and a couple of hours on this movie.
B00D6BQG1W|1.0|Poo story line.I stopped watch just after 10 min. Very predictable.  I mean when it's a Zombie and when a human, you can't tell.
B0051HNMTI|5.0|I got this app and just messed around with it. After about a month of reduced sugar food intake and using this app for at least once I day I got really good abs. I still have them to this day. I recommend this app.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I can't wait for their next DVD!  This one was so great that I watch it (or listen to the CD) almost every day.  Five stars is probably not enough!
B008MM9630|4.0|16 is not enough energy. very additive game. Fun for the kids and I play too. Only wish I could figure out how to get friends.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Every time I listen to it I start at the beginning and go all the way through. Every song has great sounds that you have never heard before.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Action packed and with a story behind it .  I would rent it again or potentially buy this one to watch again.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|It is a great game I loved it. You should definetly play it. It was great. Play it. I am obsessed with it
B000O8OTNC|4.0|It works. Contrary to the negative reviews. Makes a fine sharpener for the pocket.<br /><br />I think the reason some have problems with this sharpener is because they are using far too much pressure. Moderate to light pressure is key. Let the tool do the work.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|I absolutely enjoyed the thrills and excitement of this trilogy. I'm left speechless and wanting more Christian Grey and Anastasia Steel. I wait anxiously for the premier of the movie next summer. It's definitely a book of lust fantasy and romance for me. I live it that fantasy realm. I anticipate EL James next book. Hopefully we get more of Mr. And Mrs. Grey<br />I'm smittened
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|This was my first biography on Lincoln's handling of the end of the civil war and his death. Really enjoyed it and learned a lot.
B00D78J7SI|5.0|I pretty much agree with Murdoch about this album...I can hear a lot of similarities to other, older Bodom songs in these songs, and that is NOT a bad thing!  This is the band's strongest album since Hatecrew, and that was one of my favorite albums by the Bodom boys.  It was heavy, still had some classical influence, and was just all around an ass kicker.  It got me into Bodom, and was the reason I went to see them with Fear Factory and Lamb of God.  I left after Bodom, because they were all I wanted to see!  No disappointment!  Are You Dead Yet? was pretty good, but was a little bland in some parts, although Alexi did well experimenting with different vocal patterns over the riffs, so that made the songs a little interesting, but not as powerful as before.  Blooddrunk was a little harder and more edgy, but not as focused as earlier albums.  Reckless got the focus and intensity correct, and the songs were good, but there was less edge.  I liked it a lot but it was AYDY? 2.0 IMO.  I got to listen to Halo of Blood before release and I was instantly hooked.  The power of the older albums (especially Follow the Reaper) was there in spades, the arrangements were focused, vocals were aggressive, drums and bass in the pocket and driving the song forward, and the guitar riffs combined Hatecrew with even more of the classical styles of Follow the Reaper.  I love this album...every song is great and I didn't find myself skipping any of them because none of them are boring.<br />Definitely one to pick up.  I agree with many that this should have been AYDY?, but then again if they wouldn't have done AYDY?, Blooddrunk, and Reckless, we wouldn't have gotten to this point.  And in my opinion it was worth the wait.
0061726834|5.0|*WARNING: SPOILER ALERT*<br /><br />The book starts out with Lena, the main character, anticipating the procedure. The procedure that will cure her of amor deliria nervosa, also known as \\"love.\\" Love is looked down upon in the society Lena was raised in. It's a disease, a sickness, a very bad thing to feel. And Lena, being the good child she is, can't wait until she is a cured one. Then she will be happy.<br /><br />Or so she thought.<br /><br />A few months before her scheduled procedure, Lena's best friend Hana starts to act weird. Lena fears for Hana's safety, thinking maybe she's got amor deliria nervosa. In an attempt to help Hana, Lena ends up finding herself in the middle of an illegal party. Music and mingling of boys and girls and dancing (big no-no's). At this very much illegal party, Lena runs into a cured one, a man named Alex. But wait. He's cured. He shouldn't be at the party. Is he a Sympathizer? Did the cure not work on him and he hasn't told anyone?<br /><br />Alex takes an interest in Lena, and at first Lena pushes him away, afraid she's going to get sick with the disease. And then, she agrees, little by little, to meet with him here and there. Weeks before her procedure, Lena realizes she does have the disease. She knows one of the symptoms is not caring about having it, is wanting love more than wanting to live, but she doesn't say anything to anyone. She hides her symptoms very well.<br /><br />But then, Lena is caught with Alex. Alex is able to get away, and the ones who caught them didn't get a good look at him to describe him. But they knew he had to be a boy. And they knew that both of them had the disease. What will happen to Lena now? Will Alex risk everything to save her? How will they ever get out of this bind?<br /><br />The Plot:<br /> The book was evenly-paced and flowed well. There were never really any dull moments, and there was always a question nagging at the back of my mind that needed to be answered. Even when finishing the book, I still had a bunch of questions. Though, I have to admit, I'm not too fond of endings like this one. It wasn't a bad ending, don't get me wrong! It was just not what I was expecting.<br /><br />The Characters:<br /> Lena starts out as a good little girl. Never breaks the law. Always says yes ma'am. Never glares. It was almost annoying. I was so glad when she was infected by love and became a little stronger, grew a backbone, so to speak, and no longer cared what happened to her. As long as she had love, she didn't care if she died or went to prison.<br /><br />Alex was a charming character, and I kind of fell in love with him. Though his character wasn't as well-rounded as some others, which was a bit disappointing because he was driving factor in the story, the reason Lena changed her mind about the procedure.<br /><br />Hana, on the other hand, was probably the character that stood out the most in the book. She was headstrong, independent, caring yet strict, beautiful yet not boastful. I loved the fact that she helped Lena keep Alex a secret, and she proved over and over again that she was a true friend, one Lena could never replace.<br /><br />All in all, I give Delirium by Lauren Oliver a solid five stars. I don't like romance novels, but I have to say, this was a captivating and beautiful love story.k, I still had a bunch of questions.

B002R88G4U|4.0|Very interesting book.  Showed the strength of the people in Guernsey during the occupation by the Germans and how they lived their lives during this time.
1401207529|4.0|great graphic novel, very glad they made into into an animated feature movie.  The artwork isn't quite as good as Dark knight Returns, but the story makes up for it.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The attention to detail (especially historical detail) is fabulous. This is one of the things which makes this series great. The ensemble cast is to be commended, they do a terrific job.
B003KRLKHC|5.0|Great movie. The visual effects were stunning and the story was interesting. Denzel was great, but that goes without saying.
B00846REIS|4.0|The was very entertaining.  It had you amaging what Gideon and Eva would look like or who would play them in a movie
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Loved Ender's Game, but who doesn't. Picked this up again after reading it 30 years ago. It is still a very good book. The begining of the book is a little slow, but it sets the ground work for the rest of the book.
B00CLIJ9A6|5.0|I am a senior citizen and a lover of classical music. The movie is very well done with a wonderful cast, and I love Maggie  Smith in whatever she does.<br />M.Rabb
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|In clear and simple terms James Altucher demonstrates that choosing yourself is the only way to live and thrive in this very complicated 21st century. You will get more than one life-changing idea from this book -- you will get the inspiration you need to go forth and be awesome! Do the ones you love a favor and share this book with them.
0374533571|2.0|I have mixed feelings about this novel. Admittedly, I breezed through this in one sitting. This shows two basic things about the book: it's engaging, and it's exceedingly easy to read.<br /><br />But while I won't deny that it kept me entertained, I find it very problematic in its depiction of a person with mental illness. How so? In short: most people who are mentally ill don't sound like children. In other words, having, say, bipolar disorder or depression doesn't mean that you're going to sound as stupid as the protagonist does. The idea that mental patients are unintelligent by default is precisely what makes people start speaking down to the patients in psychiatric hospitals. (As a woman with bipolar disorder who has been hospitalized for it, I can assure you that it's absolutely infuriating when that happens.) Alas, this book will do nothing to change that; if anything, it'll make staff members more likely to assume that the crazy people in their care are also idiots. At least the film, for all its faults, had a protagonist who could have plausibly graduated high school.<br /><br />Another problem is that, for a novel, it doesn't seem to like classic novels very much. For one, the plots of several classics ruined for anybody unfortunate enough to not have read them yet; secondly, the narrator complains, in his limited way, about almost each and every one of them. He has no appreciation for literature whatsoever! I suppose it wouldn't quite fit if the character was able to analyze books brilliantly due to his aforementioned stupidity. But it's rather strange to find a book in which the classics are so maligned, regardless of why that's the case. (Where's your respect for great books, Mr. Quick? Seriously, that's not okay!) But I guess that we should all be watching football instead of reading anyway, though, because clearly football fixes everything.<br /><br />So I don't know. It was entertaining. But it was also very problematic as far as portrayals of the mentally ill go, and against intellectual pursuits. I guess in the end I'm going to have to go with \\"mixed feelings\\" and leave it at that. After all, I am bipolar; I couldn't possibly come up with anything more complex now, could I?ntally ill go, and against intellectual pursuits. I guess in the end I'm going to have to go with \\"mixed feelings\\" and leave it at that. After all, I am bipolar; I couldn't possibly come up with anything more complex now, could I?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun

Now  i have shoes US 11=44.5 Europen size shoes, thats mean, that Amazon is right, information ir producers homepage wrong.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Enjoyed this book just as much as The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. I didn't want to put it down. Most enjoyable!
B004XZR63M|5.0|Great information for someone looking to do network marketing.  The book addresses the need to readjust our thinking and why.  Times are changing as well as the commonly accepted way of earning a living.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|This movie took me by surprise! Tom Cruise played an excellent role in this movie! The movie was action packed from the beginning to the end, and full of twist!
B001DE29SS|5.0|Robert Downey Jr is arguably one of the best actors of the late 20th century/early 21st century.  His portrayal of another screen legend, Charlie Chaplin is amazing.  This is a must see for fans of Chaplin and fans of Downey Jr alike.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|Does a great job conveying the German side of the air war in the North African and western European Theaters.  As an ex-military pilot I thoroughly enjoyed it but my wife did not.<br /><br />....a compelling story adequately told.
B00199B2Z8|3.0|Normally Bill Bryson's work leaves me in stitches, unfortunately, this book did not.  Besides being made up of vignettes geared<br />to a British readership, it was dated prior to 2000 A.D. making him appear clueless about life in the U.S.  His descriptions are<br />often exaggerated beyond belief and bland.  Perhaps you have to be a foreigner to get the humor, if it is there.
B002ZCY7PU|4.0|Other custom should know that the dvd's is difference region code, and sometimes you need to clear the dvd before you use it.

B0050DIWFC|3.0|While it kept my interest all the way through, I definitely would not read it again.  Jacob's mother a teacher and father DA should have recognized their son for what he was many years back.  Both had their blinders on.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game is EPIC but I need help with multiplayer how to do you talk to other people and war do u use to talk.
B004R13U6Y|1.0|I have a lot of documents assempled as pdf-packages - created with Adobe Acrobat. But pdf-packages dosen't work in ezPDF (on Kindle Fire HD) which only displays the first page. Went back to Adobe's APP Reader (free) - it does everything as expected.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|This is very good to carry around and play whenever you have to wait.  You always have your phone.  Also good for when you wake up at night.
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|After listening to a few of there songs on the radio I thought I would give it a go on CD.  I enjoyed listening to the album and would say that it was worth the purchase price.

B00421IR5I|5.0|Very funny and entertaining family movie! I am a french teacher and would highly recommend this film for ages 10 and up!
B008K8VDPU|3.0|It's a fun little app.  Doesn't allow chords, not that they are easy to do anyway, but it does have a full keyboard (scroll left and right from middle C).  I like it's ability to record/playback, switch instruments like an organ, play from recorded music.
B0091REZMW|4.0|searches are just challenging enough to keep you hooked. fun graphics and characters. entertaining theme with a clue board game vibe.
