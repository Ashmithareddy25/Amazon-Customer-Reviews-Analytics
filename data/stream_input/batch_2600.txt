B008CLI4N4|5.0|If you have not heard of Game of Thrones yet, I don't know what rock you've been living under for the past few years.  I finally caved and decided to watch the show, and it did not disappoint the hype it has built.  Everyone I've talked to that has watched this show is absolutely in love with it, and I understand why.  This show is only for mature audiences, but if that doesn't bother you then you will really enjoy it.
B007HUD6OS|4.0|I like the Theodore Boone series.  I would like to see more.  The stories are easy to relate to regarding how people would really feel and react to the situation.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|Emma Stone is absolutely incredible in this movie, and the movie itself is no disappointment.  If you're looking for an action movie you will be disappointed, but otherwise this movie has few to no faults.
B00AM0C6YG|5.0|Mesmerizing music. So beautiful.  There are bits and pieces of traditional sounds from the UK, Africa, and other folk traditions.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|The songs included in this collection are radio edits and some of them are shorter than their album counter-parts, but GRRR! is an exceptional collection of the Stones' greatest hits and I highly recommend this collection for any Stones beginner that is trying to cultivate their knowledge/interest of one of the greatest rock band of all time.
B0088W6LAK|5.0|The playback on instant view was great. I Hope Amazon buys the right to make new episodes.  Bring Back Stargate, it be long enough.
1439196834|4.0|I got a lot of laughs out of The Playbook, and I would recommend it, but only if the reader is a huge fan of Barney Stinson.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|Only issue in mine, Amelie doesn't work so I can only use three of the four girls. But such a cute game!
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Downloaded on my Kindle Fire game play is great, works great! Lot of fun to play! I would recommend this game for 7/8 yrs. old an up! Works just great on the Kindle!
B00BB8SKPW|1.0|Like Man On Fire, Denzel is addicted and hiding it once again, but this time it's on a plane. The only part that gripped me was the crash sequence and the John Goodman character. Other than that, I think many of you will be disappointed by the lack of plot and the shabby &#34;moral of the story&#34; at the end. Who cares if he reconnected with his son? They didn't even develop that relationship in the movie.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|All Ms Reichs books are wonderful, keep you on your toes until the very end, and yet are all different enough that you don't get bored with characters.
B00881PTRC|4.0|An old favorite in my house. Lots of different subjects to choose from to entertain children of all ages. A good buy
B00CX1TSSO|4.0|I watched this with the wife and kids. we all enjoyed it and will watch it again.  we were all entertained through-out.
B008393Q2O|5.0|Wow! This notepad has been a plus, easy to use I would definitely recommend it to<br />others. One of the best I've had the pleasure of using.
B002AWX6UM|5.0|A glimpse into the experience of a child soldier and it really does make you think.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in the impacts of war on children, their families and the perseverance of caregivers who make a difference in the rehabilitation work that is necessary for children to try to reintegrate into society.
B00632HWOG|5.0|It's great, I've enjoyed using Yahoo Mail and would recommend it to others. I found it easy to be user friendly, no hang ups.
B00006IM9Q|5.0|With all the esencial Blondie songs, how can you go wrong? This is a must-have for any true Debbie Harry fan that remembers the original song releases, AND also for the newly aquainted listeners. (A time machine in CD form!)
1609611543|5.0|I am a nurse who studies nutrition. The information in this book blew me away. It has altered the way I eat and do I feel better. It is too bad wheat is so genetically altered because I love bread but won't touch it now.
B000002KK2|5.0|The sultry sound of her voice is perfect for this collection of songs. &#34;Easy Money&#34;  and &#34;Danny's All-star Joint&#34;  would not have the same dynamics sung by anyone else. Her rendition of &#34;The Last Chance Texaco&#34; brings chill bumps! Exelent album!
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great show. I love the characters and the story line is always interesting. Even when the plot may be a tad far fetched, they make it believable.  Alicia is a good wife, mother, and lawyer but flawed enough that she comes across as real
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I love the story and series. I read it in its entirety in two days at the beach. I can't wait for the sequel.
B005MMY9A8|3.0|It was an interesting movie.  Not up to the par of Spiderman, but it was entertaining. I don't like that Amazon makes me I have to write a paragraph just to create a review for an okay movie..
B002AWX6UM|4.0|Ishmael's use of specific details grappled me into the story and made me  feel as if  I was  the main character himself. Very good book but just  a little too graphic for young teens.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|It was a very enjoyable flim and a must see.  I'm glad I have it in my personal library. Recommended
B0085YOD1A|4.0|Widget displays how much power is left in an attractive, eye-pleasing way.  Also, how many hours expected battery to last.  Not sure if it is accurate though.
B00AEBB8BU|3.0|This Blu-Ray is NOT, I repeat NOT, remastered video!!!!! It is just a copy of the DVD!!!<br />If you already own the DVD version, SAVE your money. It's only a COPY! I'm completely disappointed with this Blu-Ray copy. I don't know how they can sell it as remastered? Here me now and believe me later, \\"It's only a Copy!\\" NOTHING has been improved! I feel like a sucker for spending my money on it.<br />The movie itself is excellent! The Blu-Ray's a misrepresentation of upgraded quality!
B007UWBQEU|5.0|Carrie at her best. A wonderful song, that I listen to over and over. The whole album is great. But this song is the one I love the most.
0517634899|5.0|Aside from the story, these books by Children's Classics are beautiful books.  Each one has a small drawing at the bottom of the spine in gold.  When stacked together on the shelf, they are gorgeous.  This book is illustrated by Jessie Willcox Smith, so the pictures are sweet and wonderful.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I know everyone always says the book is better but this book is a total different story and I loved it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a very fun game...my son and I are enjoying it.  Confused on the first level but now we have it down pat.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Looks great.... I actually have not used it much yet...but needed it for my iPad ......think I will love it!
B008DM4OTA|5.0|She plays on it and enjoys it.  They get to cure a lot of things.  Give meds, shots, and bandages.  There are other little games mixed in, too.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Play it every chance I get.  I like how everything is sequential and you have to combine items.  Fun fun fun
B0040HO01Y|5.0|No sex. . .<br />No profanity. . .<br />No violence. . .<br />Just a simple portrayal of a hamlet, and a small town in England a hundred years ago or so.  Very nice.  My wife and I have watched this season a couple of times all the way through.  Highly recommended.
B002KYXO7A|5.0|This is a classic movie. It was actually my high school kids that wanted to watch it (again).  The color and clarity was very good, but I had hoped that for the bit of extra money for HD, that it would be widescreen.<br /><br />It has numerous musical numbers and dancing that are fantastic. I have seen it many times but I never tire of watching it.
159463176X|1.0|Terribly disorganized and disjointed development of both plot and characters. Impossible to follow. Wonderful beginning but becomes more and more painful to read until it completely falls apart at the end. Seems as though he completely lost interest in what he was writting  as the book goes on until he finally just gives up. Can't imagine why this book was ever published in the first place.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Great game, graphics good, sound and music zen Kitaro style...Great time pass and diversion. My son just love it a lot!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Bounced around too much and not as captivating as the Kite runner. And that's enough, so I am short 5 words.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use the program to relax everyday after a hard day at work, and the rain and ocean make me feel great...  Take all stress away! I'll never stop using it...
B008Y768XO|4.0|The tie that develops between a grown man and a wee pup grows stronger all the time.  RIchard Gere is hilarious as the custodian of the dog when he tries to teach it to fetch.  His portrayal of love for the animal as it grows is moving.  The story could be compared and contrasted to Lassie Come Home.  Both are joyful and both are tearjerkers in the loveliest way.  Lassie loves a boy; Hachi loves a grown man.  Both have that love returned.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|Don't know why I didn't hear about this movie when it came out.  Different slant on Robin Hood but very enjoyable.
B008CPZNL6|3.0|Flipboard worked great on my original kindle fire and now with my KF HD I can't sign in. Help me flipboard!
B005FITIF0|5.0|I don't understand why this film was not more widely publicized and distributed. It tells of the children of Sudan and one man's attempt to save them. It is also a story of redemption and proof that we all can change our lives for the better. Gerard Butler is excellent and should have received an Oscar nod.
1577314808|5.0|This is the philosophy that is basic to understanding the postmodern world. An easy read and it will satisfy a lot of questions.

0802473156|5.0|This is a revealing book that offers a revealing look into the relationships of couples. It has a short survey to identify how each individual self-identifies, and then discovers the ways in which your spouse is the same or different. Good help for all kinds of couples.
B009G8GRX6|4.0|I had heard MADNESS on Sirius/XM's channel Sixx Sense, and enjoyed it.  Then, the following week, this albumn went on sale for $2.99.  I grabbed it, and wow.  I've listened to it many times now, and enjoy it more and more each time.
0553381695|4.0|My daughter asked for this book for Christmas. She reports it is a great read. The book offers the opportunity to appreciate a different world that helps us do a better job of living our lives.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|I've been following these gentlemen on their YouTube page for several years now, and they never fail to dissapoint.  I was truly astonished at how well they were able to duplicate the feel of several popular movie songs, and their own original work is just as good.  If you enjoy classical music, or are fans already, this album is a worthy addition to  your collection.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Every character, every clever quip, every heartache or joyous occasion, and every laugh out loud moment were a delight. The acting and writing were excellent, and I can't wait to see their story continue.
B00138CYD4|4.0|I picked this up because a) it was on sale, and b) it has all of the recent Santana + &#60;other artist&#62; songs on it that I like.  It was well worth the price, and would have been worth the full price.  My only complaint is that some of the songs are the radio edit versions.  My personal preference is for the &#34;album&#34; version of a song, not the (usually shorter) radio version.  Still, worth every penny.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a fun game.  Just challenging enough not to drive you crazy.  I enjoyed playing this game.  I would definitely recommend. this game.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I loved this movie, it was something different, but depicts a good love story. Both actors did an amazing job. Nice to see Bradley cooper in such a different role!!!
B0087EACJK|4.0|I was addicted but had to quit playing after quite a while cause I just can't figure out to get to the next level.  Frustrating at times.
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|Once you get over the ginormous cell phone thats used in the movie, it really is timeless. Watched again this week with my 3 year old who loved it. Great for adults and kids. HIGHLY recommend!!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game was perfect. A good mix of story, challenging puzzles, and long gameplay. If you are looking for a clue game this definitely worth it
B008J34466|2.0|I am a dance instructor. I love her music.... the beat.... however I can't use much of her stuff<br />because the words are filthy. I wish she would consider using more appropriate language for those of us<br />older.

B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|If the books are anything like the movie, makes me want to pick up the books and read them.  Awesome
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I got this game thinking it wouldn't really be all that exciting and that the levels would be easy, but this game is somethin. It requires you to think and use logic to solve some of the doors, this game is a great mind game and is a lot of fun as well! I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone!! :D
0061339202|4.0|The product was what I expected and it arrived in a timely manner.  It helped me to continue my research.  Thanks sharing your resource with me.

B003R1B9MW|5.0|Character development is great, and not just for the main character, Francis Ouimet, but also for his Mom, Dad, and especially his boyhood hero, Harry Vardon, now his (respected and respectful) competitor.<br /><br />Easy Peasy, Lemon Squeezy.  Best line in the movie :-D
B0094K1PW4|2.0|This movie might have been slightly more enjoyable in a movie theater, but still not very good.  The screen is very dark throughout most of the movie, making it hard to see unless you are in a pitch-dark room while watching it.  The main characters in the movie, from my recollection, don't ever really do much to influence the outcome of the movie except in a fairly contrived way. They basically just serve as &#34;witnesses&#34; with their video camera while trying to avoid getting hurt/killed or avoid getting in trouble with the adults in the movie, and grow personally as part of the process.
B001EBWINQ|5.0|There is a very small group of films that I have watched over and over and over (at least 100 times each). They include this one, To Have and Have Not, The Big Sleep, the 39 Steps, and the Lady Vanishes. Ironically, because Casablanca is the best of the lot, I watch it less than the other 4 because I rarely watch them from start to finish. I will generally only watch it if I know I have the time for the entire movie. Of course, I will watch bits and pieces of it if that is all I have time for since I have no problem remembering the rest of it.
B000X2H8G4|3.0|The cord distance between the headphones and microphone needs to be 3 times longer. Ept getting high pitched feed bak.
B004W1GCQO|1.0|Could not download this product. When it did down load, it would stop playing an repeat the download. Not a workable situation for me.
0061733199|4.0|In a real crisis can see me grabbing this and running for the hills. It would be nice to stick away in a waterproof safe, if I'm ever swept away by a tornado or stuck on a deserted island with nothing else to read.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|The cord was too short for my needs so I returned it. No problem. I am sure it is a great product but not what I wanted.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|For the price, a good mobile game. Lots of repeat enemies and levels, but the amount of different armors is great. Much better with the tilt controls on, the game sometimes confuses the slide motion with the repulsor blasts.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Seen it several times.  Fun for the family, not terribly violent but it has it's moments.  Kids 10 and 12 were able to enjoy the comic lines, action, etc.  Wife and I enjoyed seeing the older folks swing into action.
0307341550|5.0|This book left me breathless! It was as good as Gone Girl (which is one of my all time favourite thrillers). I loved the main character and how self-depricating she was as well as the family dynamics.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Bizarre, wonderful and scary TV show. There is an enormous amount of production value here, along with intriguing story lines.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Better than temple run!!! But I'm barly playing it anymore. This is more challenging though!! With trains coming at you and it gets faster every now and then, it's 2x the challenges and fun.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|I've enjoy watching Judy Garland's Wizard of Oz every two or three years with my kids.  I'd give it five stars, and I'd take my family to see it on a big screen in a theater.  But this tedious prequel pales in comparison.  The green screen seems like an unwelcome extra character. The only reason I kept watching it to the end was to please my ten-year-old, but she didn't think it was all that great either.  If not for the shadow of the classic OZ, I might give this three stars, but I can't help comparing it to the way better movie that they could have and should have made, and my disappointment left a bitter aftertaste.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|I enjoyed this so much I did not want to stop. I do have a life! Lots of fun and great graphics. Run just fine on my Kindle Fire. My Kindle is two years old so it is an older version and I had no problems.

B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I have been waiting for Kaleb's book and it was fantastic. I was very happy that the focus of the book revolved around the main characters and that the cut away scenes were not long and drawn out like in some other series that I read. I have already read this book twice! Loved It!  I cannot wait to see what happens next in this series.
B0063IH60K|1.0|This game played one time. Can not get it to work. My husband loves to play solitaire. Wanted this to work. Will have to fine another one.
B004XNGKBS|4.0|I do find the app useful at times but it's not something I use every day.  Sometimes you do have to wait for whatever you are trying to write to copy over. I like it for what it is. Just don't expect to fit an abundance of information into one line.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Too many loose ends. I was left wondering about several characters. I hoped for a happier ending. Hosseini writes beautifully.
0989524116|5.0|Outin, like Outview, is more than a great thriller, all the spiritual parts make this a special read. Fans of Paulo Coelho, Dan Millman, and even Erin Morgenstern will love this trilogy. Pre order the third book if possible.

B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I like it  I think it is very entertaining and my children love it and always ask to play it
0670014893|3.0|Not a bad book. Not great either. There are plenty of reviews here, so I will not add my 2 cents. What I will say, is I am sick and tired of print and Kindle books with mistakes all through. I am the worlds worst speller, but can somehow detect misspelled words with ease. Defense is not spelled defence, unless it's different in England? It was spelled incorrectly over and over and over and it annoyed the heck out of me. I'm sick of computer spell checked books. Shouldn't at least one human put their eyes on a book before it hits the stands?

I became very involved with the characters and felt like I was suffering along with them. Ending was unexpected but brought the whole story together.

However, I accidentally kinda bought the gemstone island. I didn't realize that you could only put dragons costing like 2,000 gems on it. I wasted 400,000 dragoncash on it and I am not very happy but my fault anyway. I am on dragonvale constantly.  My only complaint is that you have to have a facebook account to get friends. that's a bummer because my brother and I were going to become friends and send each other gifts. so without facebook, you cant have friends.

0451205766|4.0|A terrific opening, excellent plot development, masterful storytelling, and involving character arcs all make for an experience that excites and enriches, but can't help but be overshadowed by the famous movie.<br /><br />The plot concerns the Corleone family, whose patriarch emigrated from Sicily and founded a gangster dynasty of unparalleled reach and influence in New York City. The Godfather, as Vito Corleone is known, can influence politicians and cops with just a few soft words, but he has a harder time with his boy Michael, who seems to want something else out of life, apart from the Family and all the trouble it entails.<br /><br />Published in 1969, when gangster fiction was strictly in the pulp category, \\"The Godfather\\" raises the bar with seeming effortlessness. Even when you know what's coming (and the story in broad strokes is little different from the movie), Puzo's ability to draw out fascinating angles and quirks makes it feel like you are coming across everything for the first time. It's a long book, yet he covers a lot of territory so quickly and effectively it reads not like fiction at all, but reported fact. I was thoroughly hooked and read through half the book in one sleepless night.<br /><br />Puzo makes believable the way the Corleones operate. Don Vito has a code, we come to understand, which Puzo contrasts poignantly with that of the world he lives in. Even if the United States is regarded as a kinder place than Sicily, it still is run by people he doesn't trust, with reason. \\"After all, are we or are we not better men than those pezzonovanti who have killed countless millions of men in our lifetimes?\\" he asks his fellow crime bosses in one of many pivotal scenes. Puzo's use of Sicilian terms and phrases comes across as entirely natural, and works to pull you deeper in.<br /><br />The novel does get a bit too baroque for its own good. For one thing, Puzo, being so masterful a storyteller, gets caught up in a few minor yarns at the expense of the main story, like with his Frank Sinatra-based Johnny Fontaine character. It's still riveting, in part because of the way he makes Fontaine surprisingly sympathetic and a vehicle for reflecting upon and even appreciating Sinatra's approach to love and art, but it doesn't really add to the overall story.<br /><br />The other issue, more serious, is the handling of Michael's character. Even when you know how his conflict with Vito will pan out, it's disappointing that Puzo wraps it up so quickly and perfunctorily. Michael in the novel is a cold character; I never realized how good Al Pacino was in the movie until I saw how well he shaded Michael to make him more likable and a touch more innocent. He's never a thug in the book, but in the end Puzo seems more comfortable with the amorality of the Corleone clan in the book than he and director Francis Ford Coppola were in the movie. The movie's second half is thrilling not only for its slam-bang ending, but a sense of deeper tragedy that never comes across effectively in the novel.<br /><br />I realize in expressing some disappointment with the book on this matter, I'm penalizing it for the greatness of the film. For the most part, the novel stands well enough on its own, but even better as a kind of after-movie primer about the deeper issues of the Corleone family. If you haven't seen the movie yet, see it, then read this. It makes a great experience even better. [Warning: You may also want to watch the sequel \\"Godfather Pt. 2\\" before reading this as it contains some plot elements from this novel, too.]the main story, like with his Frank Sinatra-based Johnny Fontaine character.

For the most part, the novel stands well enough on its own, but even better as a kind of after-movie primer about the deeper issues of the Corleone family. If you haven't seen the movie yet, see it, then read this. It makes a great experience even better. [Warning: You may also want to watch the sequel \\"Godfather Pt. 2\\" before reading this as it contains some plot elements from this novel, too.]
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Its it's a good application that allows me to download my texts to my laptop. Being a student, it helps a lot.
B004PYDBVM|5.0|A courageous, straight forward telling of oppression and triumph.  An rare and telling insight into the hermit kingdom.  The best book on the subject.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|This should be the end of the \\"die hard\\" saga.  Thankfully, I only rented this one, instead of buying it full price.  There is lots of action...unrealistic action that is so ridiculous it's hard to fathom.  Oh sure, the special effects, explosions, hundreds of wrecked cars, innocent lives taken during the mayhem chase I guess is what excites the emotions in this one.<br /><br />There's nothing original about the story line, other than John's son is now introduced into the heroics of saving the world...well, their little corner of the world, anyway.  ***Yawn!***<br /><br />Stop the madness and let the diehard series die a silent death.  Really...it's for the best.
B008EKOIN8|1.0|Bookgroup choice.<br /><br />I'm familiar with Mr. Pollan's other titles, but had never read him before. We chose this book for our monthly meeting (teaches me to miss last month's meeting!), I bought it for Kindle, and gave it a go.<br /><br />The condescension this author exhibits towards his subjects is embarrassing for me as a reader, and must be appalling to the people kind enough to let this guy hang out with them. While the historical context is interesting, and some of his conjectures even intriguing, I can't get past the pomposity of the prose.<br /><br />It's gonna be a fun meeting tonight. ;)
B00CWVGBEO|2.0|So, here we have another shoot-em-up movie where guns never run out of bullets, full auto rifles never hitting anyone 20 yards away, but someone with a semi-auto handgun can damn near kill with every shot fired.  *sigh*  And then you have the Corvette that can reach 200 mph, conduct a 180 degree \\"J\\" turn, conduct another reverse \\"J\\" turn while going backwards at a high rate of speed, take out two FBI SUV's, all without losing control.  The acting is forced, with ridiculas idiotic scenes that make absolutely no sense whatsoever, let alone being unbelievable. Oh, the magic of hollywood.  I'm surprised A.S. even took on this part.  He's a better actor than how he is portrayed in this movie, imho.<br /><br />Glad I only paid for rental, instead of adding it to my Auhnuld collection.  This is a 'one time ever' viewable movie.  A week from now, I won't have any recollection as to what this movie was all about.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|My daughter and I have fun for hours with this game. Love it! It is worth it to download. Fun!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I have been in the hospital and have not had the time to watch this movie.  It arrived in great condition. When I am able to watch it I am  sure that I will enjoy it.
B002RT2BXQ|5.0|The Fountainhead is my favorite motion picture.  In 1949 it inspired me and enabled me to overcome many challenges during the next 64 years.  It convinced me that Socialism in any form was evil.  Celebration of Individualism is the main feature of the film.  Soon after I first saw the movie I read the book, which is even more inspirational.  The movie is a good adaptation of the book, but the book has more detail.  I re-read it at least once a year.<br />I did play a major role in sending men to the moon, joining the &#34;Von Braun Team&#34; in 1951.
B004UPANGM|1.0|It seems this movie was made so movie fans would shy away from watching movies ever again. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!
B00A23MYCC|5.0|funny movie kids have watched it multiple tmes so Im glad we orderd it through amazon…it was an instant video
B005NS0VNU|5.0|If you are an REM fan then buying a compilation CD with many of the bands hits on it is obviously a win.<br /><br />If you are not an REM fan or havent heard much of their music before this is not a bad place to start.<br /><br />Buying on Amazon with the new Mp3 service makes this a no brainer for any fan.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I downloaded this first, but it is sort of boring.  I like the other solitaire app I got because there is more variety.
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|Believe it or not this movie was very romantic, never seen a movie with such a huge twist like this. Feel free to watch this with the family I promise you will enjoy.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I HATE HATE HATE WHO SOOKIE ENDE UP WITH! WTF!! I WANTED BILL.. OR QUINN! I WAS SO MAD! I LITERALLY PUT THE BOOK DOWN AND HAD TO COOL DOWN BEFORE I COULD READ THE LAST CHAPTER.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Many years ago I was on a trip to New York and visited one of the art museums.  I remember standing in walking by painting after painting until I came upon one piece that stopped me.  I stood there for about 20 minutes in awe, intrigued, inspired.  The longer I looked the more details I found and the more questions I had.  What did it mean, what was it trying to convey, what was the artist trying to tell me and what was the artist's inspiration?  I still think about that painting and hope that I will have the opportunity to revisit it one day and would my interpretation be different now.<br />This is how I felt reading this book.  I read many and they are beautiful but on rare occasion I am stopped in my tracks by a real masterpiece.  A complex work of art that makes me constantly think and re read sentences to admire the details.  And I look forward to going back years from now and re reading this modern day classic.  Don't compare this to his other works of art just appreciate it for its own unique wonderment.
B00BDAP66E|3.0|I don't really see any reason for this app since it does not do anything that cannot be done with options on the regular FB page. Good thing it is free.
B006ZB3V2C|3.0|Maybe I could if I would receive the &#34;APP&#34;.  It's been almost 45 minutes or more and I still have not received &#34;Lighting Bug - Sleep Clock&#34;.  I trust by the time I get up in the morning, I will have it.  I have faith that I will;)  I hope I can give it more than three stars!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|challenging puzzles not too hard or too easy gets your mind working but only 8levels...looking forward to more. only 4 stars since there are only the 8 levels so far.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|I recomend this book for anyone who is interested in fantasy, the characters are very interesting and so is the story.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I ended up deleting it because you can't even get through one game without an ad interruption. They purposefully do that so you get so annoyed you have to buy the app instead.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is awesome its so addicting and the best part is its free. I really recommend you get it
B00CLZ4B4I|4.0|great show for the family.  Good acting and very good story line.  I am surprised that the general rating for it is not higher.  It is one of the best family shows we have seen all year.
B002M9WW30|5.0|What else can I say Rocky is a Classic my favorite film in the series remains Rocky I the rest are really good too
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book, ending left you wanting more though, twists and turns throughout, couldn't put it down.. Hope there is a book two.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Is there any Baldacci book that isn't awesome?!?! The Hit was spectacular and I could not put it down until it was finished!
B00D3V85FA|4.0|If you're a fan of the classics, then you'll find something to listen to in this album.  The sound is pretty much the same as it's always been, Ozzy sounds like Ozzy, and this could have been one of their old albums remastered.  To some people, that might be a turn off, but for the fans that are still out there it's a refreshing look back at the music we like.<br /><br />Hell, they don't sound anything like the pretty pop bands that clog up the radio these days, so I call it a win across the board.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love the way the author works in the dialogs between Ana's inner selves.  The book is a page turner.  It is definitely worth reading.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|It's amazing that the sabs are still at it !  And they prove their talent is not limited to the past.  This is pure melodic metal done Sabbath style. Every band that is metal today owes a lot to this band and this cd sounds a lot like their early stuff , but also from today. Some of it reminded me of their first disc from 1970 , while others seemed like black Sabbath volume 4.  It's a loud thumping cd for sure.  We have already lost dio , and now the lead guitarist is fighting cancer. So it was a very good thing to have this band put this out and deliver the goods.  If you don't like their first cd though you may not like this pounding deliberate style of metal.  It's not fast metal it's the type that thumps down on  you.  This version has a cd with bonus tracks on it too. three more songs and the song methademic should have been on the first disc and not a bonus song. Black Sabbath was always ready to tell you where it was at concerning hard drug usage. As in it sucks.  But this cd doesn't , it is classic Sabbath all the way.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire just leaves you anxious to get one's hands on the next volume. The detailed descriptionof the various scenes puts me right inside the story making it hard to believe that a movie could duplicate the writtings.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|Very entertaining, crazy action, thrills and dark humor.  This is not a film that would be suitable for small children, as it combines fairy tale fantasy with horror and some sexual situations.  Thoroughly enjoyed it and well worth the time to watch.
B0042J6VUS|3.0|I don't mind this purchase for the price and does it's job in a competent manner. My only complaints involve the ease (or lack of) with adjusting the holder and the balance of the tri-pod itself. Unless place in the exact right way it is liable to fall over. Not bad for the price but not usable in every scenario.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Couldn't finish it, the movie seemed to be more directed to pre-teen or teenage girls.  Might have been more entertaining on the big screen and in 3D but for the &#34;little&#34; screen.....nah.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I'm looking forward to more of Eva & Gideon. I don't understand why people were so upset, I'm glad this wasn't the end.
0989524116|5.0|What button do I push to give OUTIN six stars! This book is a rocking, mind blowing journey to the edges of reality. The question is which side? I had a great time hanging out with Booker, Spencer and Nate. I'll be thinking about Outin for a long time. I want to write the author and ask him where the entrance is, because I know there's a way in!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like this app much better than the other apps with the same type of game play. Hope they add more levels soon.
B005WGIJPA|5.0|This is an awesome toy, but at this price, it is a ripoff. I got this product of lego.com for it's REGULAR price, not some guy trying to make money and selling it for a huge amount of money. All in all, great toy, but DON'T buy it from here unless it goes down to a smaller price than lego.com. This is the link:http://shop.lego.com/en-US/The-Batmobile-and-the-Two-Face-Chase-6864. There, the price is GOOD.
147674355X|4.0|I truly enjoyed this book & it's in a genre I typically don't enjoy. The plot was well thought out and smartly woven. Everything was tied up in the end, including the symbolism behind some of the items noted early on in the book. Parts of the story were predictable, but other parts I just didn't see coming. I loved the writing style and found the book easy to read. I also couldn't put the book down! Well done, Colleen Hoover, well done! This book deserves all the hype it has received.
B00CWVFPGO|4.0|Arnold kicks as per usual. Jonny Knoxville is vey good as the comedy relief. Guns, cars, stuff being blown up. What more could one ask for?
B00D41H2PS|5.0|I loved the town and the puzzles.  Very nice on 1st generation Kindle fire.  No bugs or problems.  Great mystery game that provided a few hours of great fun.  Please make more like this!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game. I love it. It's fun, intriguing, addicting and can be done for two minutes or twenty. Great for passing time while you're waiting for someone or something.
1476734941|2.0|I saw this on KLRU (the last bit). How he fasted for 2 days eating his regular diet the rest. I don't know how to substitute his diet cause its not what i eat here.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This is one of the sweetest kids movies I have seen in a long time.  There is plenty of potty-humor that kids love but it's very tame (references to a pun on &#34;duty/doody&#34;), has an original story, and teaches kids about goodness, sacrifice and friendship.  Kids & adults alike in our home could watch this again & again.
B00A8MGIZG|3.0|I found it to be a good film Tom and Halle did a very good acting job. Though I was able to follow it, my husband found it moved and jumped around too much. It is very sci-fi but I did get it.
B00110K62U|5.0|I saw this concert on PBS and was thrilled to be able to purchase it.  It is great to have my own DVD and be able to share it with friends I know will appreciate it.  This is far superior to any other Les Mis production I've seen.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|It is just like being a Trekkie or eating your favorite potatoe chip, you just can't get enough fo it. This series does meet every expectation. I will be proceeding to the next series.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Music is fantastic and overall the effort is great. The only missing is the frequency of the riffs from Tony Iommi - slow, fast, slow fast etc. What confuses are the again multi versions with the latest extra deluxe version with extra bonus over bonus with 1 song nativity in black - get ready.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Movie has a lot going on but it's captivating. Your mind is opened to possibilities and ideas of how the past always repeats itself. I would place this in the category of Inception and Memento for its creativity.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|I have read Jane Austen before but I never realized what a great sense of humor she has.  I'm glad I read it.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|This is music? I listen to the message more than the crazy space beats and computer music. The lyrics are complete garbage.<br /><br />\\"I am a God So hurry up with my damn massage In a French-ass restaurant Hurry up with my damn croissants I am a God I am a God I am a God....\\"<br /><br />Are you people freaking serious?
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Great Series, a good break from reality and reality TV!  Plots are a little bit different than your standard sitcom plots.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|This movie has everything you want if you're into cult classics. One of the best films I've seen. Worth the buy.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|My go to page. Love it! You can find anything your looking for, with just a click or the sound of your voice. Fantastic Google.
B0063M22QO|4.0|What a wonderful version of a classic game. I love the selection of games, the vibrant colors and the variations. A fun way to wile away down time.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|It is a real puzzler it's easy at first simple but then it gets harder and the challenge of it is just obsessing but fun.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I am a new Smart Phone user and find this app to be very user friendly!  It loads up quickly and switches screens as fast as my laptop.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game was fun, scary, and challenging, all that you could ask for in a game. I got lost into it so many times basically screaming &quot;he's found me! he's found me&quot; then mentally have to tell my self of course he did, its part of the game (although I'm still a little freaked out). Definatly must get it!
B00A8MGLAI|4.0|I liked how it went though out time. It was all I had expected.<br />I did not like buying it from amazon ,Wal-Mart was cheaper and Florida taxes were paid and<br />I did not have to pay shipping I could have received it just as fast.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|For the money this is a very quiet, efficient cooler. It is the second one I have purchased for my builds.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|I have read through the series of books 4 times and I don't remember any scenes of whores sharpening their skills on each other. It adds nothing to the story and cheapens it. It does help to maintain the MA rating though.
0142419850|4.0|This is a great story line. My 11 year old who is not a big reader reads this book almost every night.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|For free this is a great game. However, it's not as good as everyone says it is. Basically, you are just running away from a giant ape. Also, sometimes the character doesn't do the action you intended and you end up dying. Still, the game itself is fun and addictive and certainly worth the price since it is free.
0062206044|4.0|Son had to read something over the summer and he picked this book. Fast read and he enjoyed it. Will probably buy the next one in the series.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|This book was so suspensful and was very well written. It is one of my most favourite books ever. Amazing!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This second book of the trilogy just made me want to stay at it and read it all of the way through.  I loved all three of the books.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|1. The Blood bath<br />2. The Mutated Hounds<br />3. The Reaping<br />4. The First Interview<br />5. The Tracker Jacker Attack
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down!  This book was well written, kept my attention which is sometimes hard.  I loved it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very creative and tricky. Can't wait for more rooms to complete when the game is updated. Recommend this for people who love puzzles and strategy.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Great action flick,  Tom is showing his age, nothing new in the story line, predictable but enjoyable. I would watch the sequel
B00CWY76CC|4.0|i wish more rooms were available....what's the point of making the game available right now if there are only a couple rooms????
B001XUH69Y|5.0|It was a classic and did not disappoint.  Love the old movies.  Had seen it so many years ago, forgot how good it was.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|A novel of youth, told by an unnamed 7-year old boy. His few summer days spent with a remarkable 11-year old girl, Lettie Hemstock. A darkish fantasy of the trials  one-step can bring. Mr. Gain an is one of my favorite authors in whatever medium he chooses. Recommended for those who enjoy well-written fantasies.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|Finally they have this game on the kindle because I had this app on my phone but now it's on here this game is really fun for kids and adults....I crashed my car into a bridge....I don't care! I love it...this game lollipops
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Its a wonderful album especially when wanting to relax and enjoy your day/evening.  Beautiful Voice and Beautiful Music to be heard.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|I hate it when people tell me to watch a movie because \\"it was epic\\" so i usually  don't read reviews of movies. this movie was  defiantly worth 2hrs of my time.
B00B4804KS|5.0|This movie was made for 3D.  It really surprised me at how fantastic this movie is in 3D.  When re-creating this Steven Spielburg was very smart with it.  Its still a fun fun movie with just more atcha moments.  Incredible!!!!!
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|If you're an &#34;old school&#34; Wizard of Oz fan, you'll enjoy the subtleties and homage to the original movie.  It's like the prequel to the original, but with a new and outstanding cast!  The 3D effects were used very well, in my opinion, and gave you the distinct feeling that you &#34;weren't in Kansas anymore!&#34;<br /><br />What you think you know or have figured out in the beginning takes a nice twist and plays out well to the end of the movie.  I don't think there could have been a finer cast choice since each one seemed to &#34;BE&#34; their part and make the character really come to life!<br /><br />I watched this with my grown daughter and son-in-law, but we didn't feel let down by the family nature and truly enjoyed it.  I agree with some earlier critics of the movie when it came out in theaters that you probably shouldn't let a very young audience (say, less than 10?) view this since it is &#34;scary&#34; in parts, but overall, a wholesome, wonderful Wizard of Oz movie!
B00B5ARKDE|5.0|Though a Lego movie this movie was incredible.  Great Storyline, the graphics in the movie were amazing.  They thought of everything is this movie as far as making sure you can tell everything is made of Legos.  It Really is an amazing story and cannot wait for the sequel to it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoyed playing this game. I like hidden object games and this is one i'll play again. on some of the levels you really have to think about what goes where. I have it on my Kindle Fire and have not had a proplem. If you have the time I would download this game.<br />Enjoy
B005OP2928|5.0|This show makes us laugh out loud. We like to finish up our day with a good laugh and this does the trick. Recommended.
B006ZB3V2C|2.0|The interface is not intuitive. Iconography seems inconsistent, add they're reused between modes to behave slightly differently. I can't really discover s way to just create my own scene with all available samples. And it looks terrible. Part interface and UI/UX, an ambience app needs to sound good. It needs to sound convincing. And the loop samples are just too low quality. With some work this could be a good app. But right now this is total pass.

0307744434|5.0|What made this book especially wonderful was how the written descriptions of the circus instantly created pictures in your mind.  The author was quite imaginative, and was able to relay the imagery vividly without an excess of words.  It truely enhanced the storyline.

B0084AZXKK|4.0|Yes it's a book for kids, but it's enough of a classic to be enjoyed at any age...and I seem to be going into my second childhood to enjoy it greatly again.m:-)
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is amazing,really amazing. It is a very good story that can teach lessons. It is a must read
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This has become a favorite with our family.  Mostly we enjoy the Many stories woven together in theses two communities.  Definitely would recommend it to everyone!
B0070UFMOW|5.0|This is a great little DAC Amp and will improve all computer audio when used correctly.<br /><br />I use the E17 with my desktop computer at work. It has been a very good purchase for me since I listen to audio 3/4 of the day. Quality of the audio ranges from streaming music to high quality FLAC files. In my opinion all audio is improved. It removes all the hums and click of the motherboard and spits out a higher bitrate when connected via USB and the driver is set to output the highest audio quality 96k/24bit (192k/24bit for toslink). Each time you connect the E17 to you Computer Via USB you MUST setup your driver. If you connect through the headphone jack you will be bypassing the DAC and the audio will not be improved. Since setting up the driver each time you use it is not intuitive I believe that the reviewers that do not notice a difference in quality may not have properly set it up.<br /><br />If you are just connecting it to your Iphone or IPod you might as well just get a plain  portable amp. If you are connecting to a digital source then this is a great well built product that improves audio for a great price.
B008Q0CO0U|5.0|I grew up watching westerns and this is just a modern day Western.  Bad guys do bad things and everything gets cleaned up by gunfire.  Right wins; evil loses.  Great lead in Whalberg with great support.  Worth watching if you are just tired of the bad guys getting away with it.
0307405095|5.0|Wonderful recipes, not just for the sweet tooth, but also sweet and savory recipes.  Also impressed by the simplicity of the ingredients and time required to make these delicious, pretty recipes.
B000VHXD7O|4.0|The story about Navajo Codetalkers in the Pacific during WWII is engrossing and the action is intense.  It is dependable but you know how it is going to end.  Still, a worthwhile investment of time.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|I love the Die Hard films and even really liked #4 - Live Free or Die Hard. This movie looked promising to me because I also like films with Russian characters so this should have been great. But, while there were some good points and the requisite cool explosions, the film fell flat overall. I could pick out several instances where a scene could have been a lot better with just a few more lines of dialogue or a little extra effort to maintain consistency with characters. Why no backstory as to how Jack and his father fell out? Why did no one in the family know Jack's career path for several years? When everyone started speaking English in front of Komarov, how did we know that Komarov understood them? And how on earth did they get to their final location (no spoilers) without being stopped by guards? (And they completely downplayed the future health effects they will likely suffer because of that trip.)<br /><br />This film made some leaps and assumptions that were hard for me to overlook since I specifically paid attention to the Russian elements and have basic geographical, cultural, and linguistic knowledge. But it wasn't terrible.
B005EI86JU|5.0|This is just what the doctor ordered...I upgraded from a D3100 to a D7000 after being frustrated with the limited features...the build quality is outstanding and I love the way my inexpensive battery grip mates to the camera...I've been experimenting with the creative lighting system using the pop-up flash and my speedlight and even the Auto FP (higher flash sync speeds)...I use exposure bracketing when outdoors...I have no negative comments about this great camera...the only disappointing feeling I get is now is the lack of funds to get some fast lenses (have a 35mm f/1.8 and 50mm f/1.8, 18-105mm kit, 70-300mm kit)...D7000, Great Camera...

B0029CR7EE|1.0|This download has several skips throughout the song. Not worth it...stay away from this one. The download was \\"How Do You Want it\\"? and is faulty. The song is good, but this download was a waste of money and time....

B00CRMX53S|5.0|forget about the summer of love we have the summer of lucky in love!<br />i have seriously had my life change for the better since listening o this song!!
B00932A2MC|3.0|I had really high expectations for this movie... but it ended up being only so-so and really quite far-fetched.  However, if you like lots of explosions and don't mind a lot of fiction, then you will probably enjoy this flick.  I'm okay with the alien-thing, but I have a little problem with 6 guys managing to reinstate a retired WWII battleship that's been sitting around as a museum for 50 years... UGH! There's fiction and then there are laws of nature...
B000W7JWUA|1.0|I love this game so decided to send a copy as a gift to an out of town friend, sadly she recently informed me that the game was missing pieces, and it was passed the return window. Also, I would feel so bad making her go to the trouble of having to ship it back to Amazon. I can understand a game having missing pieces if it came from a 3rd party seller but from Amazon I expect a much higher standard. My friend can't play the game with the missing pieces (the settlements/castles) so this was a waste and now I am just embarrassed that her birthday gift is basically useless.
B008ENNXQI|3.0|Kind of a waste of Julia's talents here, but it was mildly entertaining and my daughter thought it was good.  Not quite as dark as Snow White & The Huntsman, but same idea.  If you are looking for a good one to watch with your girls this could be it, otherwise you may want to keep looking.
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|........Crashes on kindle fire hd... It stays on for about 30 seconds..... I'm just glad I didn't pay for it.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|It is fun, the graphics are great. I love the fact that I can personalize my little monster. It is an overall great game to kill time with
1936608898|5.0|I've been eating paleo for about 2 years 80/20. This book and program really taught me about food, food labels, and about myself. It has changed my relationship with food from a reward to fuel for my body. My hair is thicker, my nails are stronger, my skin is glowing, and my clothes are loose. The format of the book is very easy to follow and does not get to \\"science-y\\". A very enjoyable and life changing read.
B001EC0OMM|5.0|How do you discribe perfection Of Katherine Hepburn? She played Tracy Lord like it was who she really was. James Stewart played the scepitcal reporter to perfection. Watching Cary Grant command a scene without many words, is a true actor at his best. When they are all three together in a scene, its captivating! The rest of the cast was wonderful...Ruth Hussey, as a photogher. Mary Nash a great character actor, as the mother. as the little sister, Dinah, Virginia Weilder was priceless. Roland Young's Uncle Willie, and John Halliday as Tracy's wayward father. I have watched this since I was a young girl, and I have now introduced it to my grandchildern. Directed by Geoge Cukor, is icing on the cake!
B00991TCOG|5.0|I learned about her about a week ago from a few other artists on YouTube. Briefly after learning about her, and wary of trying new things, I clicked on one of her videos. A few minutes later, and after watching every single one of her videos, I just had to buy this album. I cannot wait until she comes out with more! This kind of music has filled a void I've had for a long time.<br /><br />Came in a timely manner and packaging was excellent.
B0026Q8EWW|4.0|I enjoyed this movie; it was uplifting an Matt Damon was completely believable as a green lawyer with high ideals.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|THE STORY WAS EXCELLENT/MANY SURPRISES THROUGHOUT FILM/GREAT CAST/ GREAT DIRECTION/VERY PLEASED<br />WITH THE ENTIRE VIEWING EXPERIENCE. MONEY WELL SPENT ON THIS MOVIE.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|too much attention to special effects and not enough to the story line.  not sure what else to say about the film, but amazon is telling me i need more words soooooo yeah
B005MLOOJA|5.0|This is one of the first intelligent series that they started writing.  If you like law and very realistic stuff.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|One of his best works!  Full of raw emotion.  It made me feel the characters' pain.  I cried at every story.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|If you like Netflix and have seen the original series Upstairs Downstairs then you MUST see this too.  Beautiful how they have redone the house.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It is the best game I have ever played its got at least 20 armor.It's got amazing graphics and villains.you all should download this game and its FREE!
B004MC0FO8|5.0|This is a great app for those moments when you hear a track you love but can't remember the title or who sang it.
B004XISI4A|5.0|This series was a mind boggling, exciting fantasy story of non-stop reading! Haven't read something like this since JRR Tolkien. Can't wait for the next book and the next..... and the next.....
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I love the look on my kindle and all the features that the clock comes with. Will use it for a long time to come.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a great game and it is fun and easy and it has awesome missions I would recommend this for all ages from 5 - 82. you should try it
B001UGB1X8|1.0|I like Tommy Lee Jones and John Goodman so I figured this would be a decent movie but I was wrong. Very disappointing.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|My son likes it but it can be a bit difficult to maneuver around since he is only 3 yrs old. But I like the &#34;serene&#34; effect it gives
B000XUBC5E|5.0|Harlan Coben books are the kind of books you get lost in.  Gone for good was one of those books that you can't put down.  You must keep going to find out what happens, and you will be shocked when you do!
B005HSL626|4.0|My son loves this one and so does my husband and I. We play it with him all the time
B002UZ5CHO|4.0|Great piece on how our food is grown, produced and treated. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a truthful representation of our food industry.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Oh. My. Word.<br />This book freaking ripped my heart out. I emotionally died, but it was the most pleasurable of a death, okay? I loved all the characters, the story, and the writing style. Sometimes the dialogue of every character seemed to be the same unnaturally flowery speech that is not common for teenagers, but I loved learning new words and phrases like 'hamartia' and 'sobriquet.'<br />I have not thought so much about the meaning of my being here on earth in a loooooong time. This book truly makes one wonder about his existence and the purpose. As Augustus would say, \\"My life is existentially fraught.\\" (Another phrase I learned)<br />Which brings me to the characters. John Green made these characters so REAL. That is the best way to describe them. Their reactions to situations were just like a person in their situation in real life would be like. These children with cancer did not have amazing, miracle-expecting, hopeful attitudes. They were as bitter as I expect I would be if I were in their situation. And this resulted in me thinking of them as real people rather than characters in my book.<br />WARNING: This book will rip your heart out, tear it into little pieces, pour gasoline on it, and light it on fire. But it is so worth it. This is probably the best book I've read all year, and it definitely pulled at my heart and maybe shaped it slightly different.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I read this book a few months ago.  I fell in love with both of the main characters.  I think I almost ruined this experience.  I was more than half way, and I couldn't help myself.  I read the last few pages.  This is the only book that I have \\"cheated on\\".  I won't do it again, and I will let things unfold the way it should.  I still think about the characters.  I have recommended this book to friends.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I would watch it again.. Great acting!! great plot. Bruce and the rest of the cast are worth the watch.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is the bomb. U will enjoy this game.<br />If u easily get bored with mobile games, this is the game to get.<br />This game is worth every dollar. Even though it's free
B00DBSZJRM|1.0|Someone said that this was a fun movie.  I sorry I watched it.  It was one of the worst films that I have seen in a long time.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love the ceasefire novels and I can't wait to see what happens next. I hope Sylvia is writing because I don't want to wait.
1926778103|5.0|One of the best art books I've seen. Excellent way to discover more about one of the  best video games of our time, as well as witness some simply incredible art.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|I've always loved this movie and it's great to be able to watch it on a hand-held device where I can take it on the go with me if I don't have the time to sit down in front of a tv.
B003BW0CB6|3.0|This book was a disappointment.  I have read and enjoyed all of Mr. Connelly's previous books.  It just kind of drifted along without the usual compelling story line.  I think that a big part of the problem was shifting the pov between the 2 main characters.  I could not get involved with the story.  And the ending was a big fizzle - no suspense, no action.  If this had been written by another author, I would have given it 2 stars.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|I love that I can take it out the road with me if I'm traveling and someone else is driving or something like that. One of those movies you can never get tired of so it's wonderful to be able to take it with me wherever I go :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Absolutely love this app. Drives you a little crazy at times, but then what puzzle game doesn't. This one is great, because you have so many puzzles all interconnected. Challenges your memory a bit to remember what you've seen where, and the order of numbers and colors, and where you can use them. Problem solving also comes into play, of course. Catch myself saying &quot;ahh!&quot;  a lot. Really nice game. Woo Hoo! to MobiGrow.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love it. It really makes you use your brain! :-) The only thing bad I have to say about this game, so far, is that the instructions were not very detailed..
B0064MPXFA|5.0|We are loving this TV series! All the actors are perfect in their roles--very well written and intriguing ! We also love Amazon Prime!
B001N3GUIE|5.0|A classic science fiction film in all respects. I am always stunned and disturbed when modern film critics/enthusiasts fail to list this film in their top 10 lists. I think I'd put it in my top 5, but if not top 5, at least top 10. The style seems a bit dated to 21st century eyes, but really now, who honestly expects a film made in the 50's to look like a film made in the last 10 years. The extras included are nice, including a complete second feature film &#34;The Invisible Boy&#34;, and several extras from the original. The story is first-rate (man's difficulty with very advanced technology), and the acting and effects are good enough to bring it off well.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I liked the movie. It was very interesting getting a glimpse of recent history. I was a little put off that every male Iranian character in the movie was portrayed as intensely aggressive and on edge. Just wonder if that was true.
B002MW50KO|1.0|This CD is as bad as all the other one star reviews indicate. I'd give it negative 100 stars, but that isn't allowed. What pains me the most about it is it's seemingly complete insincerity. We all know Bob Dylan never was a great singer, and now is worse than ever, but that is less painful than what is delivered here. Bob delivers his singing (not too good), along with children's choirs, and arrangements that came straight from my dentist's office. If Bob and/or his producer/s thought that was a good idea, they should have thought some more. A straight production in any of Bob's many styles would have been much better. (Take your pick, straight acoustic, with the Band, Nashville Skyline, etc ...) This mix of Muzak, Christmas, and Dylan makes The Chipmunks Christmas album sound quite appealing, and makes me doubt Dylan's sincerity. This CD sounds like a recording done only to fulfill a contractual obligation, nothing more. I bought this at a library sale for one cent, and it only reaches that value as amusement. I could go on, but pain isn't worth it.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|I enjoy John Grisham's novels and this was no different - it was a quick read as it kept my interest all the way to the end
B008I43DYU|5.0|I was surprised w/the professional looks to this calculator.  And while fooling around with it I found that there was an extension that can be used w/it for higher mathematics.  I just downloaded it so I need to take more time on my new Kindle Fire to find how to restore that added feature.  But great little app to have available, now I don't have to fumble around trying to find my little hand held calculator that gets lost under all the papers, etc. (Oh, and BTW, the price was sure right!)
B004N6369Y|5.0|As always another good read from Danielle - she always writes a good novel and I'll continue to read her books
B005PK57NU|5.0|A few reviewers claimed the plot were reused. I disagree. Good season. My question: Why does Klinda wear the same dang clothing and hairstyle every single episode.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|The game was colorful colorful and easy to play, but my six-year old granddaughter tired of the game very quickly.
B004MYF4SS|5.0|I discovered the Lewis trilogy while visiting Scotland and started with the second book because I didn't know that it was a trilogy.  I loved The Lewis Man and so found The Blackhouse.  This is a very good book - a mystery with history!  I can't wait until the third book - The Chessmen - is available in the states.
B0098G7AWS|5.0|the love story was very romantic.  Acting was very good.  Special effects were spectacular.  I rewatch it every so often.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I watched the Good Wife all the time, but realized that I missed the first few episodes.  It was nice to watch the beginning to see how all of this started.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|No comment! I am so busy reading and playing other games that I do not have enough time to play this game.
B0083SBMBM|2.0|What can be said? This is a movie for 10 year olds with no taste. It doesn't even have any of the charm or humor of the Iron Man movies. Just a smorgasbord of superheroes fighting and fighting ad nauseum. Yawn.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It's nice to check my facebook when I am out but I can not always pull it up when I want to chat with others.
B004QXJZXA|5.0|This movie, along with Frankenheimer's Grand Prix, is one of the two best racing movies ever made.<br /><br />- Feeling of authenticity<br /><br />- Great cars<br /><br />- Loud<br /><br />- Fast<br /><br />Doesn't have the same significance of storyline that Grand Prix has, but the racing is as good or better. Where Grand Prix was open-wheel, this is sports car endurance racing. Great conversation toward the transition between second and third acts about racing: \\"A lot of people go through life doing things badly. Racing's important to men who do it well.\\" Amen. (Replace with \\"racing\\" with \\"work\\" and \\"men\\" with \\"winners\\" and you've got something with which to replace the presidential busts on Mount Rushmore.)
B003U51EE8|4.0|I was unable to watch when was on broadcast tv. Is very interesting with the plot constantly changing.  What comes next is impossible to guess.
B000MAOLVW|5.0|Briefly:<br /><br />- Has an interesting storyline<br /><br />- Has interesting, visually appealing imagery<br /><br />- Has a feeling of authenticity<br /><br />I watch this and I can't believe that the same director created the disappointment that was Ronin. Grand Prix has an intelligent plot, believable, interesting characters, and lots of racing. It is also very well presented. This is a quality movie. Somebody ought to make more of them.
B000HF2NTE|5.0|This movie is very suspenseful the first time you see it. Very well done action movie. I like action movies that have some good banter in them. Stallone and banter ?!?!?!?!?!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone. Its a wonderful story that shows how one can grow and what the power of love can do. The reference book at the end is a must have for anyone who would like to know the language of flowers
0812550706|5.0|This book met my expectations. I can't imagine a world 30 years from now. The parallels between this book and the world today are frightening. Lord of the flies meets Tron.
B0091REZMW|4.0|It's a fun game. My only problem is that it has trouble loading sometimes and will kick me completely out of the game. I find it's no different than the facebook version. You have to purchase diamonds there to move forward too.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|So many of these games seem to be over before you start but this one is plenty long without too much tedium.
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|At first the story seems disjointed, but then all the storylines start converging to create a mind bending masterpiece. Loved it!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is a fun and great game even you have a hard time passing each level,  I would recommend it to everyone,
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A fun game but it needs more levels. I like that some of the levels were challenging but not so hard you couldn't figure them out.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Trying to get the hang of this one but I am up for a challenge. Enjoying learning it.  Everyone should try it.
B001HN69AY|2.0|I didn't really enjoy this movie.  It was confusing and difficult to follow.  There is so much back story that you don't know anything about that it's really hard to figure out what's going on.  I had to read up on the movie online to get it.  Giving it away.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Mr. Hosseini has such a talent at stringing beauty and tragedy together.  He considers his readers intelligent and does not overstate, instead he allows his characters to state their story and moves on. I love how the story was told with so many narratives, giving the reader a full picture as well as making the book hard to put down.
0743490304|5.0|Enjoyed this book.  It is fast paced, as are all his novels, and kept me up late reading it! The research was thorough and I was sorry when it ended.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Battery Pro works for me because I can check when needed to see how much power I have left.  It keeps me from letting my battery go dead.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|challenging but solvable.  Ready for more floors.  I didn't come across any glitches.  Great for all ages. I would get it again
0780624890|5.0|I have been a fan of this movie since the first time i saw it.  I wanted to add it to my collection but heard the Blu-ray wasnt worth the investment.  I found a used copy of the DV for cheap and i must say it looks pretty darn good.
B0009VSB06|5.0|This is a great detector I am having so much fun with this and it's pretty accurate.  I would recommend this item very much.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I like the fact that this product reminds me that its time to recharge the battery.  I would recommend this to anyone who owns a Kindle Fire.  Very worthwhile.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Pretty cool movie. I thought the acting was very good and the storyline pretty creative. Would watch this movie again.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|It isn't a difficult game and it isn't very long but it's fun to kill time. It's like having a mario bros game on my tablet. I like that you can save gold buttons and dress your paper guy in new costumes! I got this app for free because it was a special they were running father's day weekend. I would pay money for it though. The graphics are nice and it is entertaining.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|This is a well made movie. It holds young childrens interest and has a message that is both timely and timeless.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Love this show. One of the better shows I've watched in a while. If you like to get your nerd on every now and then, this show is for you.
B004WE01YA|5.0|One of the most amazazing animated films in a great presentation, 3D,blu-ray and a digital copy. I'm very happy with this product!
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I absolutely LOVED everything about this book! It was soo great, I enjoyed every part, and I feel in love with maxon just as America did. I got mad when she did. I loved it and would recommend this series to anybody!
B006ZB3V2C|2.0|The free app of the day in the Amazon App Store for June 19, 2013 was Lightning Bug - Sleep Clock from lightningbug.me.<br /><br />This is apparently another app that is designed to be an alarm clock which wakes you up with different visual and audio effects.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this app is rather disappointing.  One example is that in the menu to choose alarm clock sounds, the sounds appear to be the same exact generic ones that were used in another alarm app by a different publisher.  Another example is the lack of an option to make the time appear in larger fonts since the font size used for the time is rather small.<br /><br />But there are some more serious flaws with this app than those above.  Only one theme pack comes with the app and even though there are several others available for free, I would recommend getting the ones you want ASAP (as soon as possible).  Why?  Because the app maker's weblinks to their FAQ and instructions page are not working and this company seems like one that could disappear at any time since they only have one other app currently offered in the Amazon app store.<br /><br />The main positive with this app is that you can create a screensaver like effect by increasing the lightning bug to a maximum value of 100.  But the problem is you don't need screensavers for tablets like you would for PCs.<br /><br />Since this app is more useful as a screensaver than an alarm clock for me, I have to give this only 2 out of 5 stars.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game was so cool. The graphics could be better but this game is addictive! I have only been playing it for 2 days and almost completed the game! Worth the download.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|So good we could watch the entire series in one sitting. Brilliant acting. One surprise after another. We love the show.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|light sharps nice is nice and compact perfect for camping to always have your knife sharp I love it go get one
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I wasn't impressed, I thought it might be more fun. Maybe it was just the speed of the wi-fi here, but it was slow and I gave up on it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|My first cmment about this book is that it was an inventive and original story.  The characters are interesting and well-developed by the author.  Although the scenes in the arena are most exciting,  needed time and effort are given to the story development and that makes this very cohesive and enjoyable.  The movie was well done but, as usual, the book ie better and well worth the reader's time.
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|Amazing game I love the graphics the gun sounds are good and over all the game is awesome amazing bam bam bam
B005544TRQ|4.0|This was different from other Law Office type shows, quick-whitted and funny.  I look forward to Season two, hopefully it will be out soon!
B0092S4WLY|5.0|This is the first time I have played a game like this and I love it,  I shall play more games now
1475972350|4.0|Todd Thiele's book Time Killer is an edge of your seat thriller about a man who has made it his mission to rid the world of the people that personally wasted his time. I have to tell you, when I first read the premise of the book, it intrigued me, because a lot of murder mysteries are just retreads of an old story with a new paint job, but not Time Killer. Todd drops you in the middle of the first murder and keeps the story rolling from there.<br />And the two detectives are written just like something that I seem to be seeing on most of the cop shows I watch. A grizzled veteran gets teamed up with a new kid and they have to overcome their prejudices and preconceived notions about each other and work together to solve the murders before it is too late. I was definitely glad to see that this book was subtitled Max Larkin Mystery #1, as I look forward to future stories between the two of them.<br />The plot was another thing: I, for one, could not figure out who the killer was until he was \\"revealed\\" and he explained what his motive for doing the deed was. Todd's writing style is one that will keep you guessing and even after the killer is revealed, he will keep you reading until the final page with the twists he puts in.<br />The only bad part of the book is the language. There is a good bit of profanity in it, and I think that may have deterred me from giving this a perfect score.<br />All things considered, this is a very well written story, Todd, and I look forward to the next one.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|It was a very well produced show.  Quality cast, writing and directing. Too bad NBC decided to kill it by moving it all over the place.  How could it ever get an audience.  Guess that's Comcast for you...
B004ULNJIU|5.0|I came across this by accident.  I like Stratham so I thought I'd give it a shot.  WOW!  What a great gritty cop drama.  Strahtam delivers.  In fact, this role was made for him.  If he's not the next Clint Eastwood or John Wayne, then I don't know who is.
B008IBPMZG|4.0|There are many characters to keep the story going, no action whatsoever but i don't mind that much.  love maggie smith in this series she's hilarious!
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|If you are a fan of the wizard of oz then I would recommend this movie to you as it expands the universe
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game. I had a blast playing it.........I just wish that you could get more levels from the start. Fun overall
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I loved a game that you just want to play one more time even though it is past midnight. The graphics are very nicely done and the game play is well thought out. Only thing I would change is the end of the game can get a bit boring. But still 5 stars.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|The movie was splendid, I could relate to R (the main character), a very depressed Zombie trying to find meaning to life. There were some parts that I could've shed a few tears because I myself deal with clinical depression daily. To many times in this movie did I feel like I was in the characters shoes, especially the few times he went to play a vinyl record. This represented something that was what R needed to change the voice and touch of a real human. And anyone who has gone through clinical depression due to relationship woes and anything else this movie is for you. You will not be disappointed
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|It stared out as a great game. So I bought it. Now on a hidden object game one of the hidden objects is behind the list of items and I can't move on because no .matter how much I tap it won't do anything!!  Needless to say I am very posses!!
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|I liked it very much. I likes the main witch. She was convincing on the mean part. Hansel and Gretel was worth watching.
B0076DELIG|3.0|This one seemed way to formula.  I wouldn't recommend Connelly to anyone with this read.  He can be a knock out.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|This season was amazing - one of the best. I was on the edge of my seat. Can't wait for the final one!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a very fun game that challenges your brain. It's unlike any game I've ever played. The only problem is... I can't figure out level 7. But I'm sure with a little deeper thought, I'll get past it! Get this FREE game and you won't regret it at all!
3832797033|3.0|The pictures are fantastic but I was hoping for a complete history on the 911.  If you are looking for an in depth look into how the 911 came about, you are looking at the wrong book. The book will give you a brief history of each model change but there is isn't enough meat to describe the conception, development and refinement of this fine vehicle.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I can't wait to read the next one! The suspense is killing me! Great Read!
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I really enjoy this online knockoff of pictionary, it functions well and is fairly easy to use. I really like playing it, but when I attempt to do a hard word and draw something for a while, having the fullscreen ad crash the app or force close it is infuriating. This happens multiple times in a row and makes taking a turn almost impossible. Once or twice I could understand, but after failing to send my picture four times in a row, the game is just no longer worth playing. It shouldn't be a performance issue on my Kindle Fire HD, it is only.  Few months old with maybe two other apps installed, none of which run in the background as I play this game. This really leads me to believe that the ads simply aren't configured properly for the device it's available for.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|If you have kids and are in this age range, it is beyond hilarious!  It is laugh out loud for you and your spouse.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Although the book started a bit slowly, it was a very exciting read and soon I couldn't put it down!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book has so much emotion and is written by a truely amazing author! I would recommend this book to all my friends and even my mom
B00821OX98|4.0|Lots of holes in the plot line, but it certainly gives a good character development and what else is there besides Dr. Who in sci-fi any more?
B002WQZHJO|5.0|Denzel Washington is awesome! Like other great cop movies, and had a satisfying ending.  I would highly recommend this movie.
B009NX409M|4.0|Good acting by great actors. I would recommend this to someone who likes to see a really good ending.  Ooops I gave it away.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|Since I have studied animation, I really enjoyed watching these amazing creatures. The overall story was good too. Wonderful concepts.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This was one of the items I had on my want list to add when I needed to have enough for a &#34;free shipment&#34; order.  Item received when I expected, but it exceeded expectations in its ability to put a sharp edge on a knife.  I got carried away after sharpening my pocket knives I went through the kitchen knives and now they have a keen edge as well.  Easy to use to get the correct angle on the blade to make it sharp.  I plan to order some more of these as gifts for Sons and Grandsons.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|It was a great Fathers Day gift I never see him anymore unless it's raining Ladies if you love your man and he plays golf buy him one it is a great gift
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This AP is OK. It works similar to application on my computer so I enjoy it. Will be nice to keep in touch with friends if I am traveling.
B0031R5K68|2.0|Very disappointing. Take the DaVinci Code, transplant to Washington, find-and-replace liberally and hey presto. Fine if this is your first Dan Brown book, but if not, then avoid.
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|What can you say.  The nextgereration by far is still my favorite series.  How can you beat drama humor and irony?
B009OXS8RQ|5.0|I love this record and am happy with my purchase. I would recommend if you like Lana Del Ray's music.
B008JFUNYG|5.0|Loved original but as far as reboots go this tops Charts for me!!!!!! Effects were awesome. Don't go into it expecting best horror flick ever. Just great remake!
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|Love the different weapons. Wish it had the M14. Love the .30. Didn't think it had a  buttstock or a short barrel but that's pretty cool
B004DLPXAO|5.0|When my Kindle Fire need to be charged its nice to be able to you my phone to continue reading my books.
0812550706|5.0|\\"I've watched through his eyes, I've listened through his ears, and I tell you he's the one. Or at least as close as we're going to get.\\" -Colonel Graff<br /><br />Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin is the child prodigy destined to save the human race from extinction. He has a child's mind but a supercomputer's intellect and he struggles with the monumental task of defeating an enemy that he has never known or seen. He is a walking paradox, a natural born killer with sympathy, a child masquerading around as a man, a reluctant leader against the \\"buggers.\\" By the time we meet Ender, the buggers have already attempted two invasions of Earth. They are a superior race with a collective mind; a third invasion could well be on the way.<br /><br />And so the people of Earth turn to a so-called \\"third,\\" - a third born in an overpopulated world where \\"thirds\\" are rare - to take on the buggers. But they aren't a hundred percent sure he's their boy. So they put him through a series of trials and war games to determine his lethality and cunning and intelligence in commanding an army in war.<br /><br />The prose is smooth as water, the dialogue pitch perfect, the use of metaphor and irony perfectly placed and by the end of \\"Ender's Game\\" you'll feel like you fought in the Battle Room. That you know Ender. That you know Peter and Valentine. That you know Alai and Hot Soup and Dink and Bean and Commander Graff and Major Anderson. And of course, after you read the final chapter, \\"The Speaker for the Dead,\\" you'll feel like you know the buggers too.<br /><br />\\"...I'm very good...\\"<br /><br />\\"Would you expect less?\\" she said. \\"You're a Wiggin.\\"<br /><br />\\"Whatever that means,\\" he said.<br /><br />\\"It means you are going to make a difference in this world.\\"<br /><br />This exchange between Valentine and Ender is what makes this tale so sad; children robbed of their innocence in a paranoid world. Ender isn't even a teenager when he endures the abuse of the Battle and Commander Schools - he is Colonel Graff's pawn in a galactic game of chess, a game the colonel believes he can win because no species with intelligence could do what he was doing; no intelligent species could willingly and systematically turn children into warriors.<br /><br />It is this fundamental breakdown of morals in a futuristic world that makes \\"Ender's Game\\" resonate so strongly.<br /><br />The bottom line: \\"Ender's Game\\" is speculative fiction at its finest. Ender is the heart and soul of the story; the psychology of human behavior explored through the eyes of a phenom in a futuristic galaxy at war as humans insatiable taste for conflict bares its ugly teeth in the most destructive manner possible. Fight with Ender. Win with Ender. Above all, learn from Ender, from his mistakes and victories and his struggle with morality.<br /><br />-Raeden Zenlonel Graff's pawn in a galactic game of chess, a game the colonel believes he can win because no species with intelligence could do what he was doing; no intelligent species could willingly and systematically turn children into warriors.<br /><br />It is this fundamental breakdown of morals in a futuristic world that makes \\"Ender's Game\\" resonate so strongly.<br /><br />The bottom line: \\"Ender's Game\\" is speculative fiction at its finest.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was a wonderful peek into the mind of a &#34;coming of age&#34; young man.  It compelled you to keep reading while at the same time was not too weighty to read. I don't have any sons, but I am a teacher, so the insights were incredible to me.  I can't wait to see the movie coming out soon.
B00321MGPG|5.0|Watched this with my 6-year-old daughter and my wife. All three of us were mesmerized by the visuals. Loved it.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I can play online with my friend an try to win them I love it there no other game the same as it.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|My wife & I have both read this book and it is truly an amazing and inspiring book.  Would recommend this to everyone, especially those who are struggling with their faith.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|I collect sound tracks.  In the case of Hans Zimmer counting \\"Man of Steel\\" I have 42 of his OST works so I am able to compare his latest work with 41 others. First off there is no point in comparing this Soundtrack which what has been used before that would be like complaining that the Rolling Stones did it better then the Beatles. Hans Zimmer has his own style and in this case he fashioned a musical score that matches the stature of the movie.  Gone is the comic book buffoonery so a different sound was called for. Here we have a dark, basso, spacious, ethereal sound with Powerful percussion, and stellar deep spaces. I have read this OST called a Wagnerian hurricane and if one is a fan of the Ring Cycle one can see this is a good comparison. The purpose of a movie soundtrack is to support the action on the screen and Hans Zimmer's work does this very well. If you have a music system up to the job prepare yourself for a sonic earthquake, huge low bass cording, stupendous zoom bass, and at the same time an ethereal descant that floats in air above all of the savagery below. If you have a good subwoofer this OST recording will put a huge smile on your face.<br /><br />The CD set comes in a nice steel case, Man of Steel after all.  The liner note are very interesting to read. There is an invite for an iOS/android app \\"Water Tower Music App\\" Z+ with a voucher number to redeem.  I looked at it and to me at least, it seems to be nothing more then a way for them to get a Warner Brothers App on you smart phone so they can push ad's at you. No thank you.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|What i learned so far about this app is that you have to plant and grow corals,rare plants and other type of item reef related. I chose this rating because it's fun to play with. I like this app because it's also interesting to find out what kind of guests your going to see in your reef. I would recommend this app to my little brother because he likes Nemo.
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|I really enjoyed the book, so I wanted to see the movie as well. Everything went wrong from the beginning. Terrible accents by the actors. Combining characters from the book into 1 person in the movie. Skipping large important points in the book, which made the movie confusing and very shallow. I hate to think that the author approved any of the changes they made. I was angry at myself for wasting 2 hours of my life on this movie.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|not nearly as good as slotomania, or yahoo free slots...very conservative on free coins and bonuses ...website hard to follow compared to the previously mentioned sites
B00006GFAB|5.0|Outstanding
B00632HWOG|2.0|do not like the new vwersion of this or att ...why do you keep changing the setup so often...sorry but give me back the classic
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Convenient and handy! Large enough to see for my middle aged eyes and priced right. I enjoy knowing precisely what time I have left on my device.
1781162646|5.0|This is a great book. I listened to the audio book. The narrator did very well. I usually just listen to audiobooks on my commute, but I had to continue listening when I got home!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was a fan of this series, one of the many readers that waited for the download, and had my book ordered months in advance. I will not be doing that again for book 4 and 5. Shame on you Sylvia for allowing us to pay $9.99 a book and not giving us the ending in 3 books like you promised. Now we are forced to pay for two more books to know the ending. So much more could have been discussed in this book and instead you used it as a filer! BOO~ I will not be buying the next two!!!
B003JH8LPW|5.0|Very engaging and very thrilling, Dan Brown did an excellent job on this one!  However, all his books are good
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Very good, sound book beautiful and good and friendly kind,true to. This book is a great book. It is great!
B007FLHW3K|5.0|It makes a striking display.  When the batteries are fresh and it is at its peak, I get a lot of questions about it.  As the batteries wear the drama wanes and it becomes basically mono-color but it is still a bright blinking LED that makes me feel much safer riding at night.  I've never actually worn out the batteries because I always break down and put in fresh ones to recover the full display.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Fun rainy day flick. I enjoyed it, but didn't love the movie. Not something I could watch again and again.
B000FC146C|5.0|I read it 35 years ago and loved it, and it's just as good now as it was then. A great summer read.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Not just piano music as the title might lead you to believe.  These musicians make classical music with an infectious joy.They bring a passion to their music that listeners can;t help but feel and enjoy.
B00B4804KS|5.0|I really enjoy watching 3D movies at home... the 3D in this movie is super... I enjoyed the movie when it first came out and I enjoyed it even more in 3D... if you don't have a 3D set-up yet, it's time to get started... what are you waiting for? Enjoy movies even more with a 3D system. Move on up to the 21st century.... enjoy life... treat the family.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|love the game really makes you have to think. tests your skills on problem solving. I would recommend it to friends
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|With this being an award-winning movie, I had high expectations.  It is a film about mental disorders with a comedic twist.  The chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence is great and the movie is worth watching.  I guess I just expected more.
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|History Lovers Only! My husband enjoyed the movie I was board and ended up playing on my phone. If you enjoy the civil war movies this one is for you, if your just watching for entertainment its slow and long.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|I am a little biased because I love Paul Rudd but this movie was very relatable for married 40 somethings.  Some very true observations and the humor of Paul Rudd.  Very worthwhile!
B004LLDN3A|4.0|What a classic movie my 4 year old enjoyed the singing and dancing, and I enjoyed watching it again after years.
B005544TRQ|4.0|A legal drama with a comedical twist.  Has some great leads playing the partners of the law firm.  Could go into a little more depth into the character's background.
B001BR7CZW|5.0|Classic Saturday Night Live cast of charactors. Love this sound track and so cool to see all the big name actors and musicans
B009LMTDL0|4.0|At first I thought this book was just about career women moving up.  However, it has a lot to offer in terms of understanding just how far we still need to go for women to achieve true equality and a stronger decision making voice in the world in general.  As a baby boomer who fought the early wars in the 70's for career equality, it's time the younger generation realized that all women have to be feminists to achieve equity and not just in the workplace.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|It is an awesome book that you can read. AND definitely hilarious and also pretty amazing This book is out of this world
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I have this game for my son loves this game he plays this all the time. Great game for strategies
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is brilliant, normally games which are complicated annoy me and i delete them after a few minutes, but this game is the perfect level of hardness.... deffinetly carrying on with this game
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is epic x 100000 And I luv it<br /> Don't think yure going to lose money because you're not
B0096MM9GG|3.0|You have to touch the controls at the exact time or your dead and the checkpoints are to far apart
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This backpack is high quality. It has plenty of room for my camera and additional lenses. You can change the configuration of the inside to best suit your needs. The outside pocket is perfect for keeping information. The back of it is well padded for your comfort and for the protection of your equipment. I am very please with this product and I'm so glad I found it!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Anything with Denzel is good and this film is no change to that. It is a good plot and makes you realize what alcohol can do to a career.
B004T4LUPW|3.0|I purchased this app to sync my Kindle calendar with MS Outlook.  Read some instructions online that said I needed a google calendar to sync with Outlook, then this to sync with Kindle.  Didn't work.  Toyed with it for a couple of days and gave up.  Actually returned my Kindle and got the iPad - made life simpler.  Can't give complete review of the app itself as I really didn't use it.
1451695195|4.0|Interesting read, Glad to know a doctor of high standing wrote this!  Long time coming  to possibly enlighten the medical community that po pos this Fact of life. Good work Doctor, Thankyou.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I am a runner so my eating has been centered around carbs.  As a result, I love carbs.  I have run several 1/2 marathons but wanted to do at least one full marathon - so at 43, I trained and completed my first full marathon in April.  I did not do nearly as well as I had hoped and I noticed towards the end of my training I was experiencing what I would consider an extra amount of fatigue - I also lost no weight whatsoever during my training, something I always do.  I chalked it up to too much training and figured after my marathon I would rest and get back to normal.  A week after my marathon, I decided to hit the gym and start weight training but had no drive and just felt tired.  This feeling just got worse - to the point I thought I needed to see the Dr.<br />Then my wife started talking about this book.  My first reaction - &#34;THERE IS NO WAY I AM GIVING UP GRAINS AND SUGAR! - A PERSON CAN'T LIVE LIKE THAT!&#34;<br />Another week or so went by AND i WAS NO BETTER.  I decided to purchase the book (Kindle version) and started reading.  What the authors were saying made sense - as much as my mind could make sense of it.  So I thought - I can try it - its only 30 days.<br /><br />Today I am on Day 20 and here is what I have noticed:<br />1.  THe 1st 2-4 days were rough - I think I was actually detoxing / going through sugar Withdrawals.  Not kidding - I honestly felt horrible.  Not just hungry but fidgety, hungry, restless, irritable...<br />2.  Days 5-7 the sugar / carb cravings were fading and my desire to snack every two hours was hardly noticeable.  Still somewhat tired and not sleeping too well.  My morning runs felt horrible - thought I was dying - OK - kidding.  But I felt no MOJO.  My times were getting worse.  I figured this was probably normal SO I kept focused on my 30 day goal.  Although, at this point I was convinced this was not going to work.<br />3.  Into the 2nd week, I started noticing this feeling in the afternoon - I felt good / alert...not seeking my 5th cup of coffee.  I would catch myself thinking throughout the day, &#34;I feel pretty good.&#34;<br /><br />So here I am on Day 20 - I have lost a belt size and my clothes are fitting differently (I started at 194lbs) and I am back to getting up at 5:30 for the gym or running everyday.  I am sleeping better, haven't eaten a Rolaid all month, not craving sugar, and I am eating things I never ate before and just feel overall better.<br />Note:  My whole family is doing this together and everyone one is looking slimmer.  My 12 year old daughter had some mac and cheese the other day with some friends (her favorite meal) and was &#34;totally grossed out&#34; by it.<br /><br />In a nutshell (because I normally don't write long reviews - if at all), this has been a great experience.  I am amazed at the differences I am feeling in my body.  I'm sure there will be ebbs and flows but I plan on incorporating this into my daily life even after the the 30 days.<br /><br />Suggestion:  If you are addicted to sugar like I was, give yourself a month to prepare your mind.  That is what I did.  I set a start date and wrapped my mind around it - then I took the leap.  Glad I did.king my 5th cup of coffee.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a Great kid_friendly game. The only problem I have with it is that you can not buy doubLe coins. I love  how unlike temple run, you do not have to tilt your device. This is very convenient.
B0009HKH6Q|5.0|This movie has impacted my life in a big way.  What a great crime caper and its easily replicated, just don't hire the weak link station wagon driver.  Check the news to see if it worked.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Cannot believe the things this man does for the woman he loves. Fell in love with Gideon from book one and I hope the continuation of this love affair is released soon! Sylvia Day you're amazing!!!
B0064NTZ6W|5.0|Possibly the delightfully depressing movie ever made.  The Germans make outstanding WWII movies, just there are too few.  Stalingrad, Das Boot, Downfall - all wonderful tragedies.
0385349947|4.0|Gender issues and viewpoints are often divisive, no place more than at work. Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg expanded her TED talk on gender equality into a readable book on the subject titled, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead. Whether you are male or female, and no matter what kind of work you perform, you're likely to find something in this book to engage your attention, draw out your views, and lead you to want to talk about them with someone else. Sandberg has brought fresh attention to this subject, and any reader interested in gender equality should consider reading this book.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (I like it)
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Claire Bowen is my favorite singer so far. Her unique style & voice are great.<br />I love the show. This gives you the opportunity to hear the music with out the interuption of what's happening on the show.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I really like this series. I like the humor and really like the relationship between Kate Becket and Castle.  Also really like the stories and the relationships between the different characters.  I like how Castle will help the police solve some of the crimes that they are trying to solve.
B00632HWOG|1.0|wont let me sign in to it.  cant ue it.  I have tried may time.  I need to call the network and have them see now and I dont seem to or want to take the time.
159448385X|1.0|I loved the story, but the condition of the book was terrible. It was rated as acceptable.  It was not. Major water damage and close to 100 pages were uncut.  Poor service.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|got this game for grandkids to pay .  My 5 year old grandson like it and play and love to buy the new parts for the cars.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoy playing this type of game. I like that you don't have to run from room to room and you really need to use your brain to solve the puzzles.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|What a great movie, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I would definitely would recommend this movie for the whole family
B008IBPMZG|4.0|Probably the strongest aspects of the show is how the characters are developed so that you form various attachments.  My wife and I watch with great regularity.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|I had forgotten how good this movie was! Music wonderful! I even remembered most of the words to the songs!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Typical Nicholas Sparks, romance,mystery, and finally the hero rescues the female from her turmoil. Again it started off well but near the end it became rushed and predictable, but by the time you start to scoff at the book you are much too invested in the characters to put it down until completed. I will tell you this, the book is a million times better than the movie!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This novel was great. I loved each individual protagonist that appeared. The narration made me feel like I was taking part in the ultimate quest to find Halliday's egg as well and left me astounded up until the end.
B00821OX98|4.0|Enjoyed Season 1. Had several high moments, a steady amount of action, and kept me coming back. Looking forward to Season 2.
B0030B621W|5.0|No spoilers here.<br />Sam Rockwell does a fantastic job at this movie. This is the second time I have seen it. The first time was a few years ago. The second time was just as good as the first time. My wife and I both kept thinking of this movie days after we watched it. She does not even like sci-fi very much, but she was happy I insisted on this film.<br />I played and beat the game The Swapper right before we watched it, and that game really compliments this movie well. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes Kevin Spacey's voice and theories of what a soul is.
B001ER4CNY|5.0|Great fun TV show. I have all the seasons on DVD. Got them all as they came out. You can get them all season by season for about $45-$50 bucks less then this set. I did. The season sets are simple to use open and put away.<br />And great fun to watch.
0689835604|5.0|I bought this book as a gift for a one-year old child.  So far, the book has provided many hours of entertainment. Would definitely recommend.
B0091PDC5U|5.0|The bonus DVD alone is worth the price. It has additional songs from the 1989 Austin City Limits show (Stevie Ray Vaughan & Double Trouble - Live From Austin, Texas). If the version of Voodoo Chile doesn't grab you by the throat and throw you around the room for 8 minutes, there's no blood running through your veins.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Love this book, Hugh really knows how to pull you in and get to know the characters and the setting.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I like thinking of myself as a princess. But now I can dress and make her to look like me. I also. like having to do the spa abed make her pretty.It's like I'm working there and it's my job to make her pretty. I just think it's so cool that I can give her a make over and a day at the spa. That's why I like this game so much. That's why I showed this game to all my friends. So I just hope that everyone gets a chance to play such a fun game with such pretty dresses. Then there are so many choices sometimes I cant deiced witch one to chose.
0345803493|5.0|cant seem to the book down such a great book. I was pricing the book and this fit my budget very well
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Very entertaining ... dark and humorous at the same time. I cant wait for season 8, and sad the show is ending.
B00006B1HH|5.0|great. was exactly what it was said to be. this is my favorite movie I cant wait to watch it again
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I know that most people will see this game as another generic, possibility even boring, addition to the multitudes of Facebook media games but my family and I have turned it into a total family experience for all 5 of us. I wouldn't change any of it!
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|Very poorly done. Acton was descent, everything else was bad....<br />Could have gone without watching this installment of the die hard series..
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|I don't know exactly why but I love this show. If you like musical theater, American Idol, or Glee, you will love Smash.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|The only way you can play this game is if you are on facebook and I do not do facebook and will not join just to play a game.  If you are going to release new games keep them as games not social media tools.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is super fun!! I had a blast playing it!! Anyway for the people that cant find the blue weight, go to the block #s its just simplifying 168 down to 14 &amp; 12 then 6,2, and 7, etc.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|It was an awesome movie with good humor.  I would not watch it if you are a slow reader/dislike subtitles though.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|great continuation of an epic love story. Has many ingredients to keep the reader so intrigued they can not put the book down, or in my case my tablet.  Second book in the series has it all Love, kinky sex, mystery, suspense, drama and happiness.  The book ends with a gleeful event but then concludes with a cliff hanger pointing to an ominous continuation in  book three. A great read for any romantic at heart.  Who doesn't love a good love story with some great sex thrown in for excitement.  Love abounds in this book from the lovers themselves and their friends and family.  Recommended it to all my friends and some wanted to borrow the book , but can't let go of my Kindle.  ha ha
B005H9B44A|5.0|I think the cast in Thor was excellent - not only Portman and Hemsworth, but all the way down the line.  I think this is an action-packed movie that still has tender moments.  I streamed this, it came through without a glitch.  A definite yes.
B00846REIS|5.0|This was great because both Eva and Gideon are troubled imperfect people.  I love seeing the struggle and how they make mistakes.  Very human.  Great book.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This has become one of my favorite board games to play with friends and family. The only con about it is that you can only play 3-4 players without an expansion pack.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This was such a hoot!  Loved the inner monologue of our hero as he masks his true feelings as he experiences falling in love for the first time.  The immaturity he displays (in the guise of a sophisticated ladies' man) is what grabs you and keeps you wanting to see him grow up.  The heroine is beautiful inside and out and is his perfect match as they stand toe to toe throughout the book.  The fight scenes are just as fun as the love ones.  Truly enjoyed this and can't wait for Twisted!
B000FBJF3M|4.0|Very entertaining and interesting book.  I read it in anticipation of a trip to Pompeii.  It gives me a feel for what life was like there at the time so I think that will enhance my trip (later this year).  It seemed very well researched.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Can't say enough positive things about performances, all spot-on.  Quality of DVD great.  I don't own many DVDs but had to have this one.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This story starts out rather dull, but then it fills with twists and captures the reader.  Not entirely realistic, but very imaginative and it makes you wonder what goes on in some people's minds or how well you think you may know someone.
1416596585|4.0|If you'd ask me, which technology journalist should write a book about Google, then Steven Levy would be high on my list. Steven's been around for a long time and wrote the excellent \\"Hackers\\" and the not so excellent \\"The Perfect Thing.\\" He is able to write about technology in an engaging way, making \\"In the Plex\\" and insightful book about how Google works... and how it doesn't work.<br /><br />The book is roughly organized around products (or projects). Since the book is about Google, it must start with the world of search and how Google was founded in Standford. How the two Googler founders were free-thinking Montessori idealists with an huge interest and background in technology stumbled on the idea of raking based on 'citations' and creating the world changing search -- google.com. It provides interesting stories about how advanced the Google search actually is and how it tried to learn from all the data it collects.<br /><br />The second chapter takes Google from the start-up to a profitable company with Google Ads. The uncool product that became a cool product by changing the perspective from \\"boring ads\\" to an interesting technological problem. How to make ads useful? Introducing the auction, removing any middle-man and just do it based on data and algorithms was the trick Google used to ruin the existing markets of ads... or should I say, take it over. The Google Ads did lead to profit, which in turn lead to growth and...<br /><br />To chapter 3 and an IPO. Google was funded based on VC money and they will expect to go public, so they can get their investment back. But Google didn't want to do that the traditional way... no... it had to be different. Nerdier, Googlier. They wanted to also disrupt the financial world, but that financial world didn't take Google too serious. It caused a lot of frustration, especially when Google stressed it's value of \\"Don't do Evil\\" which wasn't taken too serious by the (perhaps Evil) Wall Street firms. Eventually they succeeded, got lots of cash, so what do you do...<br /><br />On to chapter 4 which starts with the invention of gmail and the need for more and more storage and computer power. This is the chapter where Google became really impressive as they changed the fiber and data centre world. Originally they ran in other company data centres, but eventually they figured they could do it better and build huge, secret data centres. Data centres need fast internet connections and power, so they actually bought most of the fiber connections, becoming one of the largest... cable companies.. I guess. They also made they move into power, but that is still undergoing. With the owning of the huge data centres, Google basically owned every aspect of their business and removed most dependencies. Now, they needed to show that they can do more than search/ads/mail, so...<br /><br />Chapter 5 follows how Google tried different markets, first with Android and then with YouTube. As a company, being dependent on one market is risky, so expanding to others and increasing traffic and using your core assets (data centres) sounds logical. First into mobile making an operating systems (basically, together with Apple, killing Nokia), then a browser and becoming an active player in the 'second browser wars' and eventually buying YouTube to \\"go into video.\\" These expanded Googles markets and made it less reliable on search only.<br /><br />So, whats left? The rest of the world. Google began expanding in other countries from Chapter 6. The most interesting story is, of course, China where the corrupt government insists on stealing freedom from people by censoring the internet... a clear evil thing to do. So, do you play ball and try, from inside, to gradually open up the internet or do you refuse. Google went in... with a regret. The government considered it won and simply needed to push more and more rules otherwise it could simple remove the connectivity. Google shall listen. Google didn't like that andcorrected its mistake after being hacked by the government. Painful. (The book doesn't share the wonderful details on how the government censorship simply makes google service look bad, missed opportunity, perhaps Steven needs to live in China for a while).<br /><br />The US government is a lot better, right? Not really. It might be less corrupt, but it still is. Chapter 7 describes how some Googlers tried to help the Obama administration but were stifled by the bureaucracy. Also, competitors started lobbying more and more against Google, so they require Lobbyists too, which doesn't seem to be evil. The biggest legal problems came, of course, from the Google library project. Scanning all the world books is certainly evil, right?<br /><br />Most of the book is exceptional positive about Google. The last chapter, Epilogue, suddenly changes its tone and shows how Google missed the boat on social networking, mostly because of how the company works. Also people became frustrated with Google, left, and started all kinds of wonderful companies such as Twitter, Foursquare, or left to join Facebook. Painful. Perhaps Google is now too big and traditional and will need to be replaced with a more modern company... facebook?<br /><br />The book is structured (as you can read above) really well. It is well written and full with wonderful stories from Googlers. It is well research and was a pleasure to read. I'd recommend it to everyone who wants to have an insight into Google. It is probably better than some of the other Google-books. I'd rate if 4 stars, but not 5. Why? At times, I was disappointed with the technical inaccuracies in the book. Also, some points were left a bit too open. Last, it felt parts were missing, such as mentioning of the Google X projects or the Google Apps infrastructure. These seem like important new markets of Google, but it wasn't mentioned. So, an excellent book and definitively recommended, but not perfect.corrected its mistake after being hacked by the government. Painful.

B000FC0V3E|5.0|This is my first Hemingway novel and I promise it wont be my last.  It's authentic and took me to another place and time with such ease.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|I must say that I have enjoyed this series immensely. I have not enjoyed anything like this in many a year.<br />There are times where I will be watching it and I will say....\\"just one more\\". And then one more leads into another, then another......et cetera....and then before I know it, it is morning.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|As the story opens and quickly gains momentum, I was on the edge of my seat with anticipation.  I love the way it was written from the perspectives of the protagonist and story teller.  As the story unfolded, it took on horror story feel. I was shocked and disturbed by the ending!
B003F3FJQO|4.0|Interesting series. This book is not quite as good as the first one but still neat to see where the story takes you.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The first half of the book went along in a way that I could tell something very strange was going on in these peoples lives.  The second half is engagingly surreal and I was shocked at the many levels of surprise endings.  Couldn't put it down.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Very different from other things I've read. My sister told me to read them and it was a great recommendation. Def better than the movies.
B000FCK65W|5.0|I can see why this is a classic.  This is a very compelling story and so authentic.  I couldn't put it down and wondered how it took me so long to find this book.
0143119680|5.0|This is a great series. Can't wait for the last book to come out! I got my sister addicted to them too. Neat combination of present and past, witches and vampires. I am a big fan of the Sookie Stackhouse novels and the Twilight series as well.
B0001CNRB6|5.0|I am a huge fan of Doris Day.  I love all her movies!!  Highly recommend this for anyone loving Doris.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Different story for sure. I am on the 2nd book. The first was better but it's still neat to see where the story leads.
0696019973|4.0|good all around book for blocks and techniques for beginners and more advanced sewing.  It has sections by themes.which are clear.
B00BTHV05M|5.0|I'm a sucker for One Republic, and I think I always will be if they keep putting out albums this good.  This is a little different than some of their other albums.  The sound is definitely One Republic, but its new and interesting.  Definitely a wonderful fresh take on their music.
B004J09ONG|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows.  It is touching and the movie can make you cry or cheer for the lion. I loved the ending and I would tell anyone they should watch this old movie.
B00AGKHFCA|5.0|This cd has many a song in many languages and all of them are very romantic. The name Passione fits it so well!
B00CWVFZ8W|5.0|This movie previews gives more than the actual movie.  It is a love story but to be honest I expected more witchcraft based on the preview but I still enjoyed the storyline.
B0058DRTGC|3.0|I found the monograph a useful supplement to the book for those of us in the social sector, but thought it was overpriced.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Good book! It gets into more about the characters life, more details. Some of the questions that you had from the previous book are answered here. But I wasn't fully happy, the end just cuts off, leaving you wanting more. Which is good for writers.<br />There's so more that's needs to be discovered.
B00AEBBA72|4.0|I absolutely love this movie... it's one of the few Johnny Depp movies I truly enjoy watching.<br /><br />I would have given it a 5 instead of a 4; however two minor little things about the dvd itself.<br /><br />1. the dvd claims [cc] closed captioned, however no matter how I set the captioning on my tv, no captioning appears.<br />2. the dvd says English subtitles, but they are huge..... they are so big they take away from the picture of the movie....<br /><br />If the captioning had worked or the subtitles had been done a little better to not dominate the screen I would have given the dvd  5 stars... Cause I really do love this movie!
B003F3NDP8|4.0|The ladies of wisteria lane are back, with more insanity (seriously) than ever. A fun season, full of intrigue and surprises. My favorite lady is still Lynette. Looking forward to getting season 7!
B008602KQI|4.0|the plot is very basic, but the acting is superior, understand why jennifer lawrence won an oscar... i care about whether or not the characters survive... very well done movie
B009XTF8KQ|4.0|The movie has an original idea which I liked. It's Not the scariest movie that year but I'd put it in the top 5 for the year. It's worth watching for the horror movie fan but it won't be going down as a timeless great like the original Exorcist.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Great read. Definitely held my attention. I really enjoyed the characters. I can't wait to read the next one! Love it.
0307944689|4.0|I think the book I bought I a very good one. I am using it right now and I have found it very useful in order to prepare me for the TOEFL test.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I had no idea what this movie was.  Thought it was a kids movie.  It was so funny and unexpected.  Ted is my new hero.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|Tremendous cast and story line. The humor was a little deep for my grandsons, but still kept them glued to their seats. I recommend this film for everyone. Thanks for making it available!
B0091REZMW|3.0|Just started playing this game and it asked to rate it. I do not know how I will like it yet.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Good graphics and I like that your energy and such maxes out and refills as time passes....otherwise  I'd be on it all day! :)
B007LGPSX0|5.0|I can remember watching this show when it first came on tv. It brings back so many memories. I wish there were more seasons though.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved it. Didn't like the ending so much. But it's great. Pls make a second one were they have a wedding and a baby.
B00881PTRC|4.0|This game is pretty fun. It's a pretty cool twist on the game I used to play on paper as a kid.
1564148793|4.0|I've recieved this book and have looked thru it and it does have some interesting sections to read and I do like this book enough to see about another of this author books called* The Sorcerer's Secrets*. I have enjoyed his points of views and how he explains things through out his book.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|This is a fun game. Simple for an adult for the most part, but an enjoyable way to pass a few minutes.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|This game is such fun I got hooked right away. I would recommend it to all of my friends and family members.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|Very pleased with it and had no problem with the seller. I had one before but couldn't find it in the stores.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I highly recommend this game. It challenges you through many obstacles which makes it fun and is perfect for ages 7 and up.
B00008G8M4|5.0|I bought this along with Armageddon for a discounted price for my husbands birthday. He loves all the apocalypse type flicks so this was right up his alley.
B004J64QSI|5.0|The only disadvantage of watching this production is that it made the movie version seem poor.  Yes the movie was more spectacular but the voices were no comparison.  Jackman was not too bad but the others including Hathaway and Crowe simply did not do the musical justice.  We lost the PBS version we had recorded on TiVo when switching to newer cable-company versions of TiVo and ordered the BluRay Disc as soon as we realized the mistake.  This is a must have if you care for the musical at all.
0316232955|5.0|only gripe is that it seemed a little too copy and paste from the screen play but I did thoroughly enjoy both the book and movie adaptations
B001Q7JD3Q|5.0|By far, this is the best Kong movie ever made. It has a great story line with depth, and the special effects are superb. The acting is as skillful as the directing.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I ENJOY THIS GAME.  LOVE IT. HOURS OF FUN.  LOTS OF CHAllenges.  VERY ADDICTIVE. RECOMMEND THIS GAME WITHOUT RESERVATION. NO PROBLEMS WITH THE WAY THE GAME RAN.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|Heart wrenching at first but heart warming as it continured,Danny Devito was funny in his characterization of Mr. Wormwood but even better as a director. I highly recommend this film.
B000Y1ZXUM|5.0|BEAUTIFUL. LIKED THE VIDEO.BEAUTIFUL FILMED AND WONDERFUL ENACTED.SHAKIRA'S VOICE AND RENDERING ARE VERY GOOD AND BEAUTIFULLY STAGE MANAGED.i RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.
B00ANA27IU|5.0|Movie was obtuse. Reading the book cleared a lot up. This was my second read, and I enjoyed it even more than about 20 years ago.
B008M87GJK|4.0|i will recommend it especially for those who like documentaries.<br />I have used copiously since I got it.  However one needs a fast gadget.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|An interesting take on mythology in the &#34;New World&#34; with a rather quirky sense of humor wandering in and out of the serious overtones of tale. I never read the original edition so I cannot address the changes in the 10th Anniversary Edition of the book, but the author himself includes an overview of the update. If you enjoyed the screen antics of Monty Python or Adams' &#34;Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&#34; series of books, you'll get a charge out of this book, it isn't a comedy but the off-kilter feeling is the same.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It answered my need for a Bible I can open easily as the sermon is going on and still take notes on the side with my Notes app.
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|My wife wanted to watch this, it was full of plot holes and bad acting.  She was even disappointed by it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A fun game that makes you think out of the box, hunt for crazy clues, solve problems, and have a great time doing it!!! Recommend it.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|Beth Hart is a vocalist with power and versatility.  Here she is paired with a virtuoso guitarist. The result is even greater than the sum of the parts.
0062073192|3.0|I see what they wanted to do here.  It's a nice collection. If you are a fan this is the book Dean and Sam are always talking about.  But it has not story just a collection in timeline form.  Nice to have, if you are a big fan, and have no other novels to buy.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Well written. Great story lines. The show keeps you attentive. I like the actors (and actresses.) You can hardly wait for the next episode.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love Downton Abbey and it is so convenient on my Kindle.  I get it free with my prime membership. The picture quality is awesome! Can't wait to watch Season 3.
B008QI6EHQ|1.0|Reading this is like swimming through quicksand and then running through Jello in a marathon. This was (1) written by an evil person (2) by someone who was taught by people from the late 1800's so the style of prose is lead compared to today (3) repetitious (4) and full of half baked intellectual arguments. In one way it must be the 'sound bytes' that people focused on rather than trying to comprehend this in its entirety that made Hitler 'successful' in selling his evil plan. The sad part is this is not fiction, he wrote it and the results of this maniac are well known. So, good luck reading this. I think it is important to read it once, likely not to be read again. But it does let you see into the mind of a monster.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Worth trying if you like this style games. I enjoy puzzle games. So I have been spending time playing it.
B0097HSS4M|2.0|I don't understand how to use it.  ok it edits photo, but there is a beauiful butterfly icon - what does that mean?! I mean add i add objects like that,or can I just get the red out.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Engaging.  Not easy, but doable.  Each puzzle is unique.  All puzzles lead to the next. And the hints are just clues, they just hint
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|Great actors.  Fantastic makeup and set design.  The story was laborious. The writer had a flimsy agenda and failed to build a convincing argument for it.  This movie was extremely disappointing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is a fun game. Engaging.  Even tough I do not like this forced reviewing to continue playing.  It is stupid.
B00AK57N00|5.0|This game is fun, addicting, and enjoyable. Yeah I know, &quot;Well, everybody says that.&quot;<br />But this game is truly all of that and it's worth .99 &cent;.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Great fun for everyone. Great picture and sound. Best price I have seen on this Blu ray disc anywhere. Classic.
B009NY43NY|5.0|This book is worth the 5 stars. It was awesome to read. I like the way the author ended were Sookie is for the end of the series. I always hoped she would end up with the man the author chose. Read the book to find out who....
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I expected a fully functional, fast, complete version of Facebook as the app but instead it's slow, incomplete and misses lots of things.  I'm really surprised.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I don't know enough to stop playing, I think I'm going to quit and 2 hours later I'm still playing I love it!
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|I love this book. I'm a teacher in Special Education, and most of my students have learning disabilities. Mistaking a learning disability for a cognitive one is what keeps them from succeeding. Getting them out of the &#34;primitive&#34; back of the brain and into the front, where they can make decisions and feel powerful about outcomes is my continuous challenge. This book reinforces this idea with research; they can get better at things if they work hard, and believe that they can. They must never give up!
B007HB5TN8|5.0|What a beautiful love story. I definitely was born in the wrong century. Authors today could learn a lot from Jane Austen.<br />I
B0077EBWVI|4.0|I enjoyed the movie but of course I'm an oldie that like the original.  It was fun to watch but I'm a fan of Kevin Bacon.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I had this game for almost two years and I still love this game it is the best game EVER!!!!!!!
B000HL09SA|5.0|What a great movie.  I loved every minute of it. The actors we perfect in their rolls and brought it to life on the screen.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I know people always say this, but it's so true.  You get so much more detail and learn so much more about the characters when reading the book.  My mom made me read this and I thought I would hate it.  It seemed like such a little kid book, but I actually really enjoyed it.  So I highly recommend it to any age.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|the Alarm Clock Xtreme is nice because it isn't extreme.  It woke me up with a pleasant alert instead of a jarring blast.  Love it!
B002VBV1S6|5.0|I was sceptical of this book when I fist started to read but once I got caught up in the rich characters, brilliantly twisted plots and style of writing, I could not put it down.<br />A definite must read!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It is very easy to use and it is just working as good as it do on my PC and I do not miss any functions, so I will for sure use it as much on the Kindle Fire as I do on my PC and my HTC One S
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|This movie looked hilarious in previews but was a major letdown in its entirety. Don't waste your time with this depressing movie!
1594481938|5.0|I bought this book because I had read high fidelity before, and I think this author has a great ability to conduct a story. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I can really recommend this book!
B0029ATTAQ|5.0|I didnt know how difficult it was to find this film with the original Eurythmics soundtrack until i lost the film on my DVR and had to replace it (the movie is very good)...The first time, i purchased the first dvd that came up thinking it would be the same but to my disappointment, it wasnt, the music was awful and the film just wasn't the same without the eurythmics soundtrack...after searching i found this version and read other reviewers say it was the original (even though it is korean) and it is! it has the eurythmics soundtrack and it is in english, just turn off the subtitles. Im actually relieved to have this dvd as it seems difficult to find the original these days unless you want a vhs tape, and even those are limited. Amazing film, revolutionary book. Highly influential for a man in his late twenties at this point in american history; certainly eye opening.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I think this game is tltq...too legit, too quit!!<br />This game is alotta fun, I suggest it to anyone who likes to use their brain and likes to laugh. Those puddings will make you chuckle the whole time you are solving  dilemmas with basic physics...try it out, you won't be sorry!!!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|this is an intelligent show and it also has a subject that I would say most of the population has gone through.  A cheating husband!<br />Yet she is able  to handle her career and children. The husband?  I am sure yet.
B008JFUO72|3.0|The people who made this movie purposefully removed many of the things which make Iron Man so compelling. Everyone knows the coolest thing about Iron Man is Iron Man himself, Tony Stark in his armor, doing cool things and saving the day. Yet for most of this movie Tony is either not in armor at all or, when he is, it is flimsy, faulty test armor. Another cool thing about Iron Man is Tony is the only Iron Man. They ruined that by putting all kinds of people in the armor and even letting the armor itself become a character, flying around and saving the day all by itself. Apparently Iron Man himself is not only not unique or special, he himself is not even needed. Early on it seemed as if they had at least gotten the idea of having a credibly formidable adversary right but in the end that too turned out to be an empty suit. Every concept gets off to a promising start then is quickly neutered as if the third installment were diagnosed with low testosterone.<br /><br />In short they took the three most important concepts for a good Iron Man film and completely gutted them. Watch this if you are a true fan, consider any Iron Man movie a 'can't miss', and are prepared to feel somewhat let down rather than exhilarated at the end. Watch this if your wish is to be merely entertained rather than elated and inspired.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|I have had sheep and know how cunning and sassy they can be.  I just love shaun the sheep.  I wish he lived on our place.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|Just discovered this series this Spring...am catching up on my Kindle....all episodes very good!!  I would recommend this show highly!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can hardly wait for the new season to start.  I just wish it hadn't lost the stars that it did.  too sad.
B007HUD6OS|4.0|It was not as good as the other books. Everyone loves when the good guys win especially against big business
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|I've tried to listen over and over and give this album a chance its just full of rant I expected more from Kanye but this is just gargage and its going out the window like a frisbie...
B000U6BT40|5.0|I just love this show.  It's so over the top.  The down to earth &#34;common&#34; man always solves the problems the brainiacs get themselves into.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I had high hopes for this film based on the cast of characters but ultimately was let down. The cast did what they do best but the story and execution left me wishing for more. An enjoyable film but not on the watch again list.
B004PGO25O|1.0|Basic read with no real depth.  I did not enjoy this book.  I was looking for something that would motivate and provide tools to beat procrastination and to get busy. This book was waffle.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not put it down. Amazing! I can't wait to start the third book. A love triangle and so much action.
B004XUMMFE|3.0|I was not impressed with the nudity or vulgarity. I liked all the actors involved and I enjoyed the concept of the show.  I am not a huge sci-fi fan, but occasionally I like to watch certain shows.
B008JFUPK8|4.0|Every movie has to carve a niche for itself. We've already had the wise-cracking superhero [[ASIN:B008JFUO72 Tony Stark]] this summer, so this goes the route of taking itself incredibly seriously. And, it's not afraid to shake up the myth a bit: Lois discovers his secret identity before he joins the Plant, nary a scrap of kryptonite to be seen (which would have been inconvenient with all that Kryptonian matter in the various spacecraft), and so on.<br /><br />Things fall pretty clearly into monochrome - evil Zod and crew, saintly JorEl and Ma and Pa Kent, Lois earnestly trying to Do The Right Thing, and the U.S. military in a flatly neutral shade of gray. The plot comes across as predictable, mostly: Invader wants Earth, irrespective of current residents, and Superman's kind of fond of Earth. (You know how that one comes out.) So, to make it watchable, they pile on the action and effects, both with very good effect. The oil-rig scene was great, but the injury to urban property values was as good as any disaster flick anywhere.<br /><br />It's a popcorn movie, a good one of its sort, with an ending that begs for a sequel (or two, or more). If you're minded to poke hole in it, you'll have a field day - I'll constrain myself to the observation that Lois's spiky heels and that sandy soil probably wouldn't play well together. It's a comic book movie, though, with all the suspension of disbelief that implies. I enjoyed it despite its one-dimensional characters, and I'm sure I'll enjoy the very probable sequel[s].<br /><br />-- wiredweird<br /><br />PS: I couldn't help but notice how much that \\"leak\\" guy looked like Julian Assange.
B00B7G3NFU|2.0|We love Helen Hunt but this role was not much for her except to show off her naked body.  I guess if it is viewed as biographical one cannot complain about the plot but that wasn't great either.
B005DJREJS|4.0|I really liked this - I have watched a ridiculous number of pilots and never get to the second episode but I watched the entire first season of Awkward in one weekend.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This first season has jam packed with great stories and the further you follow the characters the more you love them and look forward to the next show.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Smart, funny, entertaining and original. Not like any procedural law show on TV. Very witty and a must-see. Highly recommended.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|This series has an abundance of interesting characters and the stories are varied and interesting.  They people of Lark Rise and Candleford quickly become your friends.  An interesting  and entertaining glimpse of the past.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So exciting and thrilling kept me on my seat waiting for the next chapter and the next and the next
B00785P2QC|4.0|Great game easy to play would be better if it didn't take so long to make money. is one of those reap time games but over all is a good game
B003AJKPL2|5.0|This is exactly what I wanted.  There IS some splatter when you pit cherries ... wear dark clothes or an apron.<br /><br />Seems very durable and I have a high success rate ... maybe 1/5 of pits don't eject properly.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It didn't take long for me to get hooked on this series!  The story line is compelling, the actors are great and the setting is breath taking.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Excellent book. Highly recommended.<br />Must read for anyone. Has nothing to do with any specific religion but provides lots of food for thought.
B0053JJLLC|4.0|Usual quick read. Plays out as a movie screenplay, as you read you keep thinking I could see this as a movie. This one would require to much cgi though like Congo.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|My grandchildren love this game.  They play it for hours. Glad I added it to my app selection.  Get it
B000QJM8Z0|1.0|I do not care how much she weighs. It was like reading the same diary entry overland over again. First time ever the movie was so much better than the book it was based upon. Have mercy.
B004HD61KE|5.0|Very creative mind coming up with this story.Lots of action and fun way to involve the Sigma Force to again unselfishly save the world from this Devil Colony.Fast read and I didn't want it to end.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|Loved it. Definite thumbs up. Got through it in two days as could not put it down. There is that enough words?
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|If you're looking for a CD with an entire playlist of excellent songs this is not for you unless<br />you are a Justin timberlake uber fan.  There are two or three good tunes but the rest are not up to par.  Not good value for the money... sorry Justin you're a great singer but this CD didn't show off your talent to the max.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I hope you enjoy this game as I did there's no adds that's my favorite part and it doesn't take a long time to load
B000FCKGPC|3.0|i have read the first three in the series so was excited to start this book after all the drama in book 3.  This novel feels like a place filler.  it only covers the storylines in Westeros excluding the wall.  Dany, Bran, Jon, Tyrion do not appear in this book, and lots of new characters are introduced.  I am hoping there is some payoff coming in the next books.
0553062182|5.0|This is a very interesting book. I have enjoyed reading it. I must read a few pages or a chapter and put the book down to think about what I have read.
B000FA675C|5.0|I really liked the Angels and Demons so I bought this one too. another riveting story. keeps you reading and its hard to put down.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|Enjoyable, with really amazing effects. Watched this and the original in preparation for the third. Loved the addition of Scarlet J. Sad that they had to change out the actor who played 'Roadie', but not tragic.
B006CC0Y0Q|5.0|The sound of his voice is why you might be reading this, and if you like it, buy it....  its good.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|I enjoyed the movie for the most part.  Curious to see if they plan to remake the Wizard of Oz.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|Love this track. Super smooth. Pharrell is popping up on every good hit out right now!!! where will we see him next?
1400069289|4.0|If you like the Malcolm Gladwell style, I mean the way he gets information from diverse sources, discovering insights and finding connections in the process, and then using some real and interesting examples to demonstrate his point, then, this is a book for you.<br /><br />Although I suppose it´s not necessarily flattering for Mr. Duhigg being compared to another contemporary writer, I really believe these two writers belong to the same school,  a new kind of researcher/story teller/teacher who is able to make science fun, practical and interesting for those of us who not necessarily have the background or time to read the \\"Journal of Neuroscience\\", for instance. In this book Charles Durhigg disects and explains why we behave through habits.<br /><br />For those readers, who complained that this book was a little bit superficial I would recommend the great book \\"Memory and Learning\\" by David Lieberman.<br /><br />FGC
B007UR1OHO|3.0|The movie itself was good, I just wish that she had remembered. The acting was good. its just sad to me.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game! Even more fun than 100  floors.  Hope to see new levels soon. Was easy to learn and just hard enough to keep you interested.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I like Mahjong and it is fun to challenge myself to finish every time.  I've made it fun for myself by nicknaming the different tiles based on the shapes- it makes it easier to search for the match.
B008DW6VOQ|4.0|I use this app to keep track of my stocks. The layout and attractive display makes watching a pleasure. It is very easy to use. Entering your stocks and other information is very easy.
B0044RUSZM|4.0|maybe it is me but if I move it , it seems to fall apart - BUT it is not a deal killer
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I use this app with my Kindle Fire. It works extremely well and makes shopping easy. I use it recently to keep track of an item so I could make that last minute bid.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I have a few years on most gamer, but this I truly loved.  Can't wait for the next levels to hit my Kindle app.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have three grandchildren.  Two own Ipads and the other did not have one.  I down loaded Minecraft to my Kiindle and the third  grandchild was able to connect with the other two and play.  minecraft is great for the imagination and it also allows the three kids to work together in sloving problems and building structures.  When we needed a little quite time around the house it was nice that they could play together.  If you are not in range of an internet they can still work on their own building their house and collecting items needed for cooking and tools to mine.  Great for car travel when traveling.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|This show is always brilliant. Whoever the writer is, wow!!!  If you have a weak stomach and get scared easily go to a different section.
B00CATSONE|5.0|The first part of the book seemed out of place talking about creativity and innovation, but once the author got to Tesla's story - The book was absolutely fascinating.<br /><br />Despite the technical nature of Tesla's inventions, the book is easy to read.I would recommend it to anyone interested in Tesla, the creative process, or just wanting to see how a good biography should be written.<br /><br />The author has chosen to make it free, but it would still be worth it at five or ten dollars.
B0017QSZW6|5.0|Great acting, great writing, great costume design, great locations! If only the Amazon app would play the entire show without stopping the film.
B0089LOG02|4.0|This book held my interest and is well written. The story was informative<br />and I would recommend this book to friends.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Seriously Silvia Day, I waited for months in anticipation of this final book and you, being more of a business woman than an author, decided to leave me hanging. Yes, I love this series and will wait for the fourth book but I am highly annoyed that I don't get to close this book and have had the whole story come together. There was a lot of moments where the book dragged too, really you could have finished it nicely. Although I am slightly frustrated I would still recommend this series just because of the characters; next time be clear though, if you are going to publish more than three books don't tell your readers that its a trilogy.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|This was a great sequel to Before Sunrise.  I cannot wait to see Before Midnight, Ethan and Julie are great together.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is one of the better apps I've played. It took a couple tries for me to get it to download on my kindle, but after it did, it played with no problems. Fun little driving game :)
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I really found this way of describing the Zombie world war interesting, the narrative was tense and the ways bits and pieces of information was told was awesome.<br /><br />Really surpriced by this book!
B00821PCJS|4.0|I started watching Falling Skies on Saturdays in between watching Law and Order.At first I wasn't impressed. especially with the aliens; I thought they were too much of a &#34;turnoff&#34;. but slowly the human characters and the storylines became a weekly must see. I'm now enjoying all the early episodes that I missed.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This being my first computer build and my first Intel Processor, the i5-3570K is lightning fast. I am very happy with my purchase. The processor has been in use for one month now and it exceeds all my expectations.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|This was another great addition to the Theodore Boone series.  John Grisham has a way of involving the reader in his characters lives.  My son has really enjoyed this series of books and we hope JG will continue adding to it.
B00CNX4YMM|5.0|No nonsense, bare bones rock the way it should be. This is my favorite album from them so far and has been in constant play since I downloaded it last week. This is the antidote for music that sucks and must be played very load while driving with the windows down.
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|Highly over rated not all true to the book. Should have been made in two parts to do the book justice
B0081L37Z0|5.0|This is a great movie, very funny but still serious at times. I have watched it multiple times now and I still enjoy watching it everytime.
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|Nice story but you know how it will end. Even so the pix of actors at the end was cool
0802473156|5.0|This is a great book! I heard about this book from people that were married and they told me it helped their relationships tremendously. After reading into the first few pages I had learned so many things that didn't make sense in previous relationships due to not understanding how other people express their feelings. Great book everybody needs to read and your relationship status doesn't matter. It refers alot to married people but I am single and I have learned how to express my feelings better to people and also it has helped me understand people better.
B000GCFY0I|3.0|Not as great as I expected but it is worth a read. Will not be reading the rest if the series but I enjoyed this book.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I find this app to be very addicting and quite entertaining. Easy concept to understand, yet the levels are challenging and some of the puzzles may take a few attempts before figuring out the solution. If you really get stuck on a level, there is a hint to help you out that appears after you have a few unsuccessful tries.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This story has every element of a YA novel that I look for. Hoover writes great teenage interactions, and the story was complex enough to keep me interested. I feel like she deals with heavy situations in an honest and authentic way. I read it one sitting that unfortunately began at 9:30 one night and ended in the wee hours of the morning.
B00COQKE2M|5.0|At first listen, this album is a little bipolar. Seems to jump around hitting a few genres. After having the album for a little over a week now and actually listening to it over and over again, it is very catchy and is something that I can continue to listen to over and over because of the variety there is on this CD. I do want to point out that Ronnie and all of the rest of Falling In Reverse are making music that they want to make and are having fun doing so. He states in an interview that people are saying that he has become a sell out and is going for the mainstream fame when you can turn that one around and say that if they were to stay with the same sound as their previous album just to give certain people what they want, that they are selling out by not letting themselves test out new waters and see what they, as a band, like. All of the members are happy with this CD and frankly I am too. I did not expect this sudden change and the music video \\"Alone\\" did scare me a little but there is a bigger picture to pretty much all of the songs on this record. I believe this is Jacky Vincent's greatest demonstration of what he can do on the fretboard thus far as a musician. Born to Lead's solo is phenomenal! The song \\"Bad Girl's Club\\" reminded me of Avril Lavigne from the start and was surprised to see that they had a sound-alike girl sing almost identical lyrics from one of her songs, but it worked and was a nice addition to the album. If you weren't impressed by Ronnie's rapping, then clearly rap isn't for you. For those of you that don't know, he will be releasing an album on his own that will be a rap CD. It has been confirmed that there will be collaborations with familiar names but none released quite yet. You can check out one of his singles here--> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcFB1NzJB10<br />I personally find it silly writing a review about music because there will always be someone who disagrees with you. I did one for this album because I believe this one deserves a chance.deserves a chance.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I love this movie.  I can watch it over and over.  Makes me laugh and brings me to tears every time.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|Best easy listening cd.  The first cd was awesome and this is even better!  Love every song.  Even my kids listen to this and really enjoy it.  Great music for the whole family.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|this is a fun game that I can't seem to put down. I got it for my kids but I think its mine now!
B0012GTZC0|5.0|really well written<br />once you get into the story it's very hard to put the book down<br />interesting insight into WW II
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|Once in a while, I want to ten star a book. This is one of those times. The Luck is part history, part fiction, part love stories, part death camps, part humor (yes, it's dry, but it's in there), all amazing. It's also a long book and I took my sweet time reading it because the words and phrases just tickled my mind.<br /><br />The story is primarily about one family, but it is also about several of their friends. There is no \\"main character\\" - there are several...and you will enjoy them all. The antagonist here isn't even so much \\"the war\\"...it's the way the war ripped apart the fabric of humanity. There is NO \\"good side/bad side\\" morality tale here, and that's probably why I liked the book so much. It didn't describe how horrible X group was, or how exploited Y group became; rather, it demonstrated the human spirit as it chances its way through trying times.<br /><br />Brilliant book! I recommend it to all audiences - 13+. It is suitable for a wide range. Okay...where's the next book in this trilogy?
1594489505|5.0|well written and great book the story line is very intriguing and it opens your eyes to what goes on around the world.
B000007492|5.0|If you like Supertramp then you'll love this. Had forgotten just how good they really were. Superb music, superbly produced.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to use app, nice options to change things up. No problems so far that I can tell. Basic game but fun.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|I have it on my phone and kindle. Same thing keeps happening all day. Internal error. Game will reload. But it never does..u exit. Try again an same thing happens..was a good game. Until today...it's not my internet. Because my son's can get on there account no problem. Restarted kindle an phone an yet still nothing...it's a shame it was fun. But not anymore....a lil disappointed..
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very well written and believable.  I had a daughter that died in a housefire a few months ago and this helped tremendously.
B004GKMV16|2.0|It seems to me the author researched London's history then made up a series of linked stories to fit in as many references to his research as possible.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This game is entertaining, but there are several problems. Just like with the 4th dungeon hunter game, it is nearly impossible to get anywhere in the game without spending a ton of money. Your only other option is to spend several weeks grinding up cash. This game also suffers from the fact that it does not have a multiplayer function, so grinding up money isn't entertaining In the slightest. Don`t play this game unless you have a lot of free time, or if you have a lot of money.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Awesome app.does just about everything.I have tried just about every app on my kindle and this one is what I have been looking for.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Our whole family LOVES this movie (mom, dad, 3 and 6 year old boys).  We have watched it time and time again.  The story is great and the bright colors and songs are awesome for young ones.  I would recommend this to everyone, children and adults!
B007CKNX28|5.0|Lets agree, Jack white could fart into a mic and you would buy it. Just an amazing mix of soft and hard. White stripes sound sometimes, and just a mellow and amazing compilation!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Spectacular acting carries this period drama to an unbelievably emotional conclusion.<br />Bravo to cast, crew,  and production staff. hats off to the writers
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It could have a happier ending why did so many people die? It had a nice ending  with the new w beginnings<br />Shirleysiler
B007FEFLTO|4.0|As a second volume, I did enjoy this book. A bit tedious at times but overall, very good. Will certainly go for the 3rd installment.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|It is a great  book  I love it greatest book ever can't wait to read the next book of the series
B0054LJGWS|1.0|I actually was not able to finish this book. Their are some life analogies that may make some people smile, but I thought it just became repetitive.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This app cannot find my location It really sucks and it's slow it's a waste of time. They need a lot of work on this app
B000JMKNVK|4.0|I really liked Lehane's characters of Kenzie & Gennaro and was sad to see that this book is probably the conclusion of their stories.  But the plot was great, with twists and turns.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very intriguing game. Made me think the entire time I played it. Worth the 2 dollars<br />If you like puzzle games, this on  is definately for you
B00A8MGLAI|4.0|Very good and well put together story of a lifes journey of differnt people with a superb all star cast.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a must have. Especialy for all of you that like Temple Run. My 11 year old daughter LOVES this game and plays it on her phone and tablet day and night nonstop. Once again, this game is a must have.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the characters and the laughs/serious moments!  Can't wait for season 4! What will Mary and her little prince do?
B005KDJCE2|5.0|Really atmospheric rock by Norwegian band Airbag, featuring outstanding lead guitar by Bjorn Riis, a disciple of David Gilmour. Bjorn is very knowledgeable about David's tone, and it shows in his excellent playing. This is not a Pink Floyd copy, but it could be PF if they were 2000s-era. If you like the Floyd, you should find this a very satisfying and pleasurable aural journey.
B00821OX98|5.0|Fantastic show! I'm a new fan whose playing catch up, but I won't miss any show from now on! Great casting and story line.  Phenomenonal acting!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Well, at first it is anyway.  Nicely thought out physics, the effects of suspension, tires and four wheel drive.  Gets a bit tiresome after a while, traversing the same terrain over and over again just to get enough points to improve the car so that you can get past some otherwise impossible obstacles.  You can &#34;purchase&#34; points of course, but this is a free game.  Why would you do that?  I recommend it.
B0015FML06|5.0|I thought that I had already left positive feedback. No problem with the product at all. No problem with the shipper. I will by the same product again. I will attempt to use the same seller!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Wow. Normal temple run is TERRIBLE compared to this! It has no lag at all and needs no WiFi. I love It.
630463949X|5.0|I thought that I had already left positive feedback. No problem with the product at all. No problem with the shipper. I will by the same product again. I will attempt to use the same seller!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great passtime<br />not too easy but does not create headaches<br />looking forward to upgrades and/or additions of more levels to come
B0000DJZB9|5.0|I thought that I had already left positive feedback. No problem with the product at all. No problem with the shipper. I will by the same product again. I will attempt to use the same seller!!
B00DF0POXA|2.0|OK, I just listened to the album via YouTube.  Thank God I didn't pay for this!! To be fair, there are flashes of brilliance here. Every once and a while something unique is presented and before I can settle into it, he replaces it with some bull*ish. If this CD was created by a 17 year old, I would say WOW! This kid is going to be something special when he matures a bit. However, considering the fact that Kanye is 36 years old, his obsessive metaphorical preoccupation with his penis comes off as childish to me. I guess the first three CDs during his early career (before his mom passed), had me expecting more for his later career. Lately, I've been way more disappointed than excited by his music. He seems to be regressing instead of maturing. It's too bad because if he could just grow up and mature a bit, his brilliance would blow us all away. SMH
B0045DO8NI|5.0|I thought that I had already left positive feedback. No problem with the product at all. No problem with the shipper. I will by the same product again. I will attempt to use the same seller!!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I am a big fan of the writing of this author.  He brings the people of Afghanistan to life and helps us understand their<br />culture with amazing stories.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I thought that I had already left positive feedback. No problem with the product at all. No problem with the shipper. I will by the same product again. I will attempt to use the same seller!!
B003UMW62A|2.0|I just purchased this blu-ray and it will not play.  I have a 4y/o magnavox bluray player. This is the first disc I've encountered that does not play.(200+ collection) It will load and play all the previews and then it tries to load the main menu screen showing the gumballs then it pauses and starts over like I just put the disk in the player. Has anyone experienced this issue?
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I thought that I had already left positive feedback. No problem with the product at all. No problem with the shipper. I will by the same product again. I will attempt to use the same seller!!
B00CE0ZY46|5.0|Silly but wonderful.  Foibles of mankind illuminated through the eyes of charming animals.  Too bad not more episodes!  Love it.

B00C2U6G7C|5.0|I'm a fan of Hans Zimmer. So, I'm biased but, I love this soundtrack. The music is very moving. I think he captures the feeling inspired by such a character as Superman, a sense of greatness, majesty, depth. The action pieces are more to my liking, but the entire album is well scored. You can feel the anticipation in the moving tracks. Track 9 is very well done, a fast paced drum sequence which cuts to a quieter piano tune as something momentous occurs in the moving. I don't want to spoil it, just in case, but it a nice juxtaposition. Also, the Superman theme for this movie (I think it is) gives a feel of someone or something important rising (such as Track 16). There is a real feel of Superman coming into is own, birth of moment. It's a great album, not John Williams, but it doesn't need to be. That album is great for its movie. This album is great for this movie.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Very different from what I expected. Still good, but some parts seemed to drag. You were totally rooting for Pat and Tiffany the whole time.
B008ALA6DW|4.0|Earth to apple, when you change interfaces on your hardware-- don't make the accessory makers pay so much that nobody bothers to pay the rights to the new interface.  I know you like high profit margins, but keep those on computers, phones, and ipads-- they feel valuable.  This 2 inch piece of plastic feels like it costs .50 to make and I should pay $5, not $30!
B00992CF6W|5.0|So I got my kindle May,23,2013 and the first thing I do is get mine craft well here's the thing you can thank YouTube because I made a vid and asked my viewers to leave a. Comment in the comments section whether I should or shouldn't get mine craft pocket edition and what I got 200,000 comments saying yes do get !!!!!!!!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game, very enjoyable. It does keep you on your toes searching for clues. It was frustrating at first but then you do get the hang of it and the fun begins.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really love this game. It's a very good time blower.I personally think this game is better than temple run.
B00B1E6FF8|4.0|good movie--- got my attention and held it<br />great insight to the workings that need to be used to find  and eliminate<br />terrorist leaders
B001MSMULG|4.0|This is the first Allon book I've read, deciding to read them in the order written. An excellent fast-paced novel with interesting characters doing unexpected things in great places.  A fun trip. I look forward to the rest of the series.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Works great on my pandigital multimedia tablet, love the lightning & explosive results, but have not checked out the online features.
B00CWV8X04|5.0|This is a pretty intelligent and well executed story. A pleasant and surprisingly engaging entertainment. You could do a lot worse in 90 minutes at the movies.
B0043WHRWA|5.0|Nathan fillion does a great job in this show playing a mystery writer. The show is more episodic as there are not normally clif hangers that the normal end of season cliff hanger.<br /><br />If you haven't watched season 1 or season 2 you need to watch them first to see character development.<br /><br />*possible spoilers*<br />During this season it starts off shaky as castle hasn't bothered to call anyone down at the station since returning to town. While he does go back to help them his ex is still in his life and surprise people in beckett's life pop up. Yet through out the season there are moments wher the two of them are being directed to the other.<br />Castle is continuing to write about Nikki heat.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I didn't like the way story presented, drug it out too long, hated the ending, would not recommend this book
B00011RPB0|4.0|This comedy is dark and it's looks like Bill's shows his own personally to be a lead star and earn an Oscar nomination for this movie.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|It had a good story line, was darker than most of Nicholas Sparks books, liked the characters, thought it could have been better without the husbands sex descriptions.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|Fun and challenging. I would recommend it for anyone as a good  game/time killer in any waiting room. Get it!!!
B009ZQJVAK|5.0|Funny, sweet, uplifting. A wonderful story of acceptance, perseverance and thinking outside of the box. Always love a movie with the Mirimax name on it.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Takes you to a world of imagination with spellbinding and mysterious fantasies of the mind.<br />Good clean entertainment with good moral basics for living a reputable life. Good overpowers evil.<br />Good for all ages. A modern fairytale. We need more like these.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|This two season series put Downton Abbey to shame. Just as glamorous but far better acting, character development, and plot. Perhaps it is the time frame, but it does not read like the soap opera that Downton does. Ah well, give the public what it wants...
B0033AI4PM|5.0|One of her of Barbara's best! Funny and heartwarming with a tint of the sadness that comes with life's challenges.<br />Great for the lovers of funny and true life stories.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This is an very enjoyable movie which has a number of twists and turns but keeps the action and adventure at a high pitch.  Really enjoyed the dead pan performance by Helen Mirren and the classic characterization by John Malkovich.  Malkovich always seems to effortless make his character seem to be Malkovich himself.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Season 1 was wonderful. Every episode left you eagerly awaiting the next.<br />Just started Season 2 and finished first episode. The story line, music, characters and background are outstanding.
B00BI745AA|5.0|I have seen Les Miserables on stage and also the movie version with Liam Neeson a few years ago.  Loved them both.  But this movie is truly a transcendent experience.  The decision by the director to record the cast singing live rather than dub in a studio recording over the action was brilliant.  There is an immediacy and urgency to the performances that I have never seen matched in any movie musical.  Because of the quality of the acting, this movie produces both heartbreaking moments, and life affirming moments.  Even some nice comedy thrown in with Sascha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter's larcenous innkeeper and wife.  Chances are anyone interested in this movie has already seen it, but if you haven't, do so NOW!
B00CATSONE|5.0|I truly enjoyed reading the book. I am not an avid reader, but I enjoy history,which is what I thought I would be reading about. Well I was wrong and couldn't be happier. A well written, inspiring book that I hope catches on to everyone else.
B009KY5OGC|5.0|I am a fast reader and can plow through a book in a couple of days.  With that said, I had a hard time reading this one rapidly.  Not because it wasn't an excellent book or because it was not well written:  I had a hard time because I had to stop so often and \\"digest\\" the information.  My heart was broken for the Native Americans, and I am so sad, sickened, and disgusted by the behavior of the whites (I am white).  Yes, the westward movement was inevitable, but to wipe out entire groups of people is simply horrid.<br />This book should be required reading for every high school student.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|genuinely this movie is a touching one and it is practically impossible odds of the outcome happening but a very warm touching scary one stemming out of a natural disaster and subsequent drama ..... if you have a family..
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Me and my wife watch two episodes every evening. Every show is full of drama and very entertaining.  I highly recommend this show
B009SH5JS4|5.0|The musical selections from this movie were very well chosen. Whether old tunes from Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong, or the French Cafe themes, and Kevin Kline singing in French? Why it's simply &#34;wannaful&#34;
B00AREIAI8|4.0|not to shabby. fun for a horse person or someone who wants one. good for kids and adults. helps pass time too.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Use this on my Kindle.  Wish the print were larger.  It's works in a pinch when away from home don't have my desk top.
B006C3Q6GG|5.0|The first time I read this series, several years ago, it was the action that dominated my impression of this beginning title. Now, it is O'Brian's mastery of characterization and descriptive nuance that prevail. What a cracking introduction to a series that represents the best in historical fiction.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Love this movie. Jamie Foxx was an excellent choice for this movie. The ending was my favorite part of the movie.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I 'm not sure how to get more energy,  and then build a supply without spending actual. money.  Others are capable.,  and  I 'm very patient.  I really like the game!  I 'll keep at it!
B00CDXOXB4|5.0|A real feel good movie.  So wonderful to see a battered life turned into something wonderful.  Would recommend it to any romantic.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book has heightened my duty to read labels. I have discovered that wheat is every food item. I would like to know how we avoid wheat.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Great movie- funny and action-packed at the same time with beloved characters from the Firefly series.  Nathan Fillion is an amazing actor along with a very superior cast.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Not only do I love that this book was set in Pittsburgh (my hometown) I loved the overall book.  I had a difficult time getting into it at first, but then it is truly just a well written novel.
B0002DKCMG|5.0|Satisfied user
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|i haven't been playing it much but when i do play it i have lots of fun!!!!!!! My friend had it so i thought it might be a cool app and i loved it.
0756913675|5.0|If you watch the movie you have to read the book, and if you read the book you have to watch the movie, Good product and excellent book
B0062NAX1U|5.0|It takes a village to raise a child. This movie is very inspiring and I definitely recommend this to those men who have children but don't step up to the plate.
B009LFVV6M|5.0|I love the movie and I love he book, definitely recommend if you are a Notebook's fan but if not its a really nice gift too
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I was a little wary of this book, thinking it was going to be very political.  Instead it was more about time travel, being a 21st century person in the mid-20th century....Great book, fast and fun and somewhat unexpected.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|While trudging through this book, a pace I tend to associate with NG, I found myself in many alternate \\"spaces.\\" Backstage was a genius way to put it when Shadow broke through, I could relate, I live backstage. I'd like an expansion on some of the god's back stories.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|That's all there is to say. Another great story with fun and exciting characters that I've grown to love. On to #3.
B0082A3HTQ|5.0|A ton of different genres, but all so good. I've fallen in love with the classical guy whose songs are used a few times on the soundtrack.
B002YVAT72|5.0|Has one purpose and does it well. If you want a high quality turntable for djing, then go get one... for $350. This product records vinyl to computer. The real question is about the QUALITY OF RECORDING. Software included is crap. Configured Audacity to rip music and playback sound at the same time (so I can hear what I'm recording), then output to 320 kbps. Works great now. I play the tracks using extend stereo settings to 5.1 surround so I can really hear the quality at full volume. Studio headphones and dolby HDMI surround sound are really the only way to know the quality. I also tweaked the quick keys in Audacity to play, stop, record, zoom to track, zoom in, zoom out, delete blank sections, export tracks, etc.. so that recording, trimming, exporting is like lightning fast. The only reason I use the mouse is to select the sections for trimming, otherwise I don't even use the mouse.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Sound quality digitally converted from needle seems to be enough for 320 kbps VBR. If you're ripping to studio quality WAV files or other, I'm not sure. 320 is enough for me :) I'm not THAT much of an audiophile lol<br />- USB connectivity, flawless and easy. Plug and play.<br />- Sleek design. I have no problem with displaying this, not matter where it's sitting.<br />- Has 2 speeds and a converter for those weird little records hahaha<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Needle is pretty noisy. When the sound is just recording, but muted, you can hear the music clearly through the needle. It kinda makes me wonder how much sound from the room it's in, is being recorded also? Haven't noticed any yet...<br />- Belt driven and Automatic. As a dj, of course I always hated the idea of belt driven automatic turntables, but in this case, it's not that bad, actually it can kind of helps if you walk away while recording in Audacity. It will automagically stop the record spinning and put the needle back on the mount for you once it's done. In this ONE case, automatic could possibly be a PRO.<br /><br />I just need this thing to make it through recording about 2000 records, average 3 songs each record (6000 songs). I bought it used (new condition) for like $57. If it makes it through 6000 songs and is still kickin, I would say it is more than worth it! Might have to replace the needle at 3000 songs. Will update in a few years when I'm done lol.be a PRO.<br /><br />I just need this thing to make it through recording about 2000 records, average 3 songs each record (6000 songs).

B00C2IJJMS|5.0|Awesome product looks brand new no scratches just as described if not better<br />Great for Blu Ray collectors like me.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|and it is better viewed on amazon video than anywhere else! I watched it all on an iPad and have no regrets!
B00594XOZU|5.0|Kik is a great fun easy to use product that is greatly made. It has many useful features and allows you to view when people read your message.
B00CV5ZPA2|2.0|Like a couple reviewers stated before me, I can't believe people are still listening to Kanye's silly, F- bomb fueled drivel. I figured it was only a matter of time before Hip Hop's biggest ego called himself a God. Ha. Kanye? You are not all that. And you are especially not a god. Get a grip.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Love this show. Don't know how I missed it first time aired but was so glad to be able to watch all episodes, marathon-style on my kindle.  I was transported back to this period. I loved it.
B0091WNK8M|3.0|I could see myself enjoying it at 11. It was fun to wiki the actors to see where they are right now.
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|didn't like it. Problem using the controls. it gets stock on the iceberg. it doesn't made no sense at all.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|the movie couldn't keep me interested. I loved Lord of the rings. better story line with excellent actors. its really not worth going to the theatre to watch. save your money
B00992CF6W|5.0|well, it wasn't me who's playing any game, but my son. He enjoys playing this. He's been asking me to download it, now he stop bothering me.
B004VD3YIM|5.0|We use.this app for my husband who is a trucker and he loves being able to see his little girl when he's away
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Wow this game is really fun!! I love how the location of the game changes periodically, keeping the game fun and different!! Two thumbs up!!
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie and it was all I expected.  You may need to watch it a few times to totally get it but overall a good flick.  :)
B008I43DYU|1.0|I hoped that something named \\"Calculator Pro\\" would have a percentage function, but no dice here. It wasn't any better than the calculator that came with my phone.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|What a great app.  Large numbers, easy to read and use. Highly recommend.  Has all the bells/whistles any one needs.  Fast.  Love it love it!!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Just wish they could come out with new levels a little faster. However, I otherwise quite enjoy the puzzles and creativity in trying to figure out where x fits or y comes next.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Great  for keeping notes, lists, to do things.  Easy to use, recommend for any one  who likes to write/take notes.  I have a book just for things I hear on tv news to further investigate or a word that doesn't register, it it a real word?  Love this app.
B005SAP45I|5.0|My 8 year old girl loves this movie and it is fun for me too.  Can't beat that!  Highly recommended ;--)
B001ER4CNY|5.0|Several weeks ago I was fortunate to catch this set at a discount from Amazon's Gold Deal. I was hesitant after reading such reviews about the packaging and storage of the twenty discs. It could have been better but this show itself is worth the sixty dollars I spent. I have already chunked the cardboard lamp and plan on getting an inexpensive binder from Target to store the twenty discs because this is a treasure I want to enjoy for years to come. The transfers are amazing for being as old of TV show this is. Sony did us fans justice by doing such a great job at the transfers (even the early B&W episodes are now looking stunning in color!). I was expecting faded colors and soft picture, but was glad to be proven wrong. I normally don't like having to purchase a seperate storage unit for my DVDs, but this show is worth it! Great buy for us fans. Highly recommended indeed!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have only had this game for a short time but I love it. It is easy and entertaining. Other games tend to freeze on my kindle but this one runs very smoothly. I wish there was a better way of getting the gems but oh well. It is still fun and currently my favorite.
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|It looked as if this would have been a great, useful app. But the constant freezing and error messages makes it very useless. Maybe it just doesn't work with a Kindle Fire? The only positive thing I can say is that I didn't pay for it. Thanks. :)
B003Z49LYO|5.0|This story is very sad and gives the viewer a small taste of the rules and roles between women and culture.  The characters are very strong and grab the attention of the viewer immediately.  Tess is a beautiful woman who is raped and then punished by her family, the church, and the man who claims to love her.  There is no happily ever after, but there is a clear picture of how one man ruined a young girl's life.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great little game and very addictive! Good fun for grown ups and children! Plenty of different things to do to keep you interested.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I felt it gave some idea of what life could be like in North Korea.  It was very thought provoking.  Took great twists and turns and was very suspenseful.  Well written.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I kept expecting this book to get good and take off, but it never did.  I think it jumped around too much.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Well written and directed. Brings out another side of the Civil war that is not seen in everyday history books
B009UX2YAC|2.0|When I first played the game I thought that it would be boring. But after a while I started to like it. Most of my friends have this game so I got it.Now I don't play it as much so if I were you I would at least try it. I think it's boring now but it's still a cool game! Thank you!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I think the acting could have been better, but the plots, special effects, were pretty good considering the low budget.
B000002GYN|5.0|A collection of The Eagles early music and hits. These songs have a message and put feelings into lyrics and rifts. This is for hearing life through rock & roll. 70's fans will be taken back.
B009GED3HS|5.0|This is a great show that is sure to be a classic. It you like the Friends series you'll love HMYM.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Truly amazing story and was filmed beautifully!  Movie is good for all ages and one that I would not pass up!
B00129H7VS|5.0|My husband Loves this show and studies it like the state bar. Wonderful packaging and fantastic gift for anyone into the war.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Seems like these days that everybody and their grandmother and maybe a few aunts and uncles as well are making zombie movies. One could easily get lost attempting to navigate the sea of undead flicks. Warm Bodies changes all that however, it is shall I say a &#34;heartwarming&#34; zombie film. I know the two don't typically go together but this film is great at what it does. I am not going into much detail because I don't want to give out any spoilers. Go see the movie if you like zombie flicks, or if you like romantic comedies, or shucks if you just like movies in general I don't think you will be disappointed.
B001VNB54A|5.0|My husband was so surprised and happy that I got him this as a gift. He was glowing for days. He loves Band of Brothers so I thought he would enjoy this too and I was right on!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love Alicia. Granted you are a bit of a goody two shoes but that is the endearing quality of the show.
B00CRW2066|3.0|If you check my reviews you can see that I almost never review anything unless I really like it. High Violet was one of the few albums that impacted me so much I wrote a review. I bought this one without hearing any of the songs in the hopes that it would be awesome also. Sadly, this album is not great or even good. It is decent at best. Nothing is exciting. None of the songs demand repeat listens. It is sonically boring and really disappointing.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I played every day for a week and for the most part it was fun. It wouldn't show my gameloft friends though which is needed.  I contacted customer care.  They told me to log out, wait an hour, and reboot.  I then attempted to try it but now the app crashes on opening. Glad I didn't make in app purchases like I have on other games.  Total waste of time.  I went to the forums and it appears this has happened to others as well. Lame.
0316056898|5.0|This is one of the most hysterical book I have ever read. The only downfall was that I didn't order the audio version!
1476712042|5.0|I really liked this book and the story.  At first I though that it was a lot like \\"Real\\" by Katy Evans.  I loved that book.  One of my favorites.  Beautiful Disaster does have a similar story line.  I would recommend this book, but nothing beats \\"Real\\" for me.
1558908846|5.0|This is a classic. They may have re-made the movie, but this is well worth the purchase & the time to watch it.
159420411X|5.0|The book is extremely well written and easy to follow. Unlike other books on mathematical modeling, that sometimes get repetitive, this book's chapters contain so many different applications, from earthquakes, to chess, to terrorism, that I never found myself feeling as if it is repetitive. This book provides great insight to the applications of prediction that are currently used, and provides a ton of interesting information.
B002K0WBY6|4.0|Got this for my husband because of it starring Sandra Bullock. It's pretty much a chick flick, but can't say more as I haven't actually watched it.
0141034599|5.0|This book is now one of my favorite books. The book gives very amusing insight into the world of stock-trading, and an interesting paradigm Taleb calls &#34;The Black Swan,&#34; to understand a lot of the pitfalls of current predictive methods. At times this books gets repetitive, but it still is very worthwhile. This book gives you a new perspective on predictive methods that I find myself sometimes incorporating into my own thinking.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I walk or jog every morning and this is very easy to use and extremely helpful. Also easy to look at a city when traveling too.
B003G4W49C|5.0|About half way through and I still don't know what's going to become of Ender Wiggin! Usually I could tell you the ending of a book by the middle, but not with this one!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|This season, in my opinion, has been the best. Castle and Beckett's relationship only gets better and the writing remains amazing. The Moonlighting curse does not apply.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This is still one of the best movies if all time. Definitely Morgan Freeman's best. Lastingly good good good entertainment.
B00448SE4S|5.0|The DvD and Blue Ray work perfectly fine, plus, its Scott Pilgrim.  My favorite movie ever, what more could I ask for?
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Well trekies it does not let you down at any noticeable way, on this one hell of a sci-fi roller coaster. That being said now that the timeline has been changed(in the first movie), they do and change things in so many intriguing and thus, entertaining plot lines. Like meeting the younger version of(Dr. Marcus), who is really hot by the way; staging the line events that involve Captain Kirk and Khan going head to head in totally different way with similair results. Lastly the effects are barnone the best of the series, even though it's older tech. but I love the way the ship looks and is designed it is futuristic scientifically accurate and some excited surprises in stuff they use in these films, bravo.<br /><br />  Jason Martin<br />  859 351-9031
B0029LCJJS|5.0|When this series first came out I wanted to start watching it then. But unless you're into history not everyone would  appreciate it, which my husband did not. So I never got started watching it until recently after I'd signed up for Amazon's Prime TV. So when I saw that The Tudors was available I started watching it & got hooked! Then when my 16year old daughter watched it one day she was hooked too! We are just finishing season 3 now! Its definitely worth watching!
B0053O89JM|5.0|Great close to a great series. Will miss House but now have all eight seasons to watch whenever we want to.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game I like HAVE downloaded in several times...buffbff buffs d xxx high buffbff hiking buffbff buff hhgfc chess hhgfc ads
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|timeless.  Will keep this for my childrens' children.  I like it because it has alot of historical events and people. I suggest viewing the movie first then read the book to fill in the gaps. I aso suggest the book be a part of your required local High School reading list.
B00979CS50|5.0|Service was great and the CD arrived in good condition. Unfortunately I didn't like the music, so I gave it as a gift and they loved it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I usually don't care much for English drama, but this series is different. I enjoy the historical context and the insight to the class system that was so different than the American experience.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great! Kept my attention and was very different from all the other puzzle games out there. I really liked it. Can't wait for more! Although, the lighting made it hard to see certain screens
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|This is a wonderful documentary and offers some great insights into the Eagles as a band as well as the individual members of the band. I enjoyed see both the old and new interviews with the band members and learning how the Eagles began back in California. It was sort of like taking a trip back in time for me to my teenage years and early adulthood because I grew up with the Eagles.<br />I can never get enough of Eagles and this documentary delivered much more than I expected. There is a lot of inside &#34;dirt&#34; on the conflicts within the band as well as conflicts with the people behind the band.  It takes us from the beginnings, their enormous success, the break-up and then getting back together. Very informative, fun, and gratifying to watch.<br />I will enjoy watching this more than once.
B0026PA05M|5.0|This entire cd is amazing! I love every single song on the album, it was definately worth the buy!!! you wont be dissapointed
B003L77G2Y|4.0|We still like this show, but so far, we are into the 4th episode and just not getting into it as much.  The main actress is awesome, though.  Maybe, more funny stuff with the zany professor is needed! I love jokes about his mental condition!
B0090KZDSK|5.0|A great continuation of the first two books I cant wait for the next too books, adds new twists to the story keeps you interested and hungry for more..<br /> I really like Sylvias writting style it suits my reading.<br />I cant wait to see what the future holds for Gideon and Eva.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|This early science fiction movie was way ahead of its time in special effects and had the complete package, cast, script, plot.<br />It truly did justice to the award-winning science fiction novel of the same name.
B002YCVX5S|1.0|Highly disappointed.  Don't understand the point of this film except to hear supposedly \\"witty dialogue\\" b/w scenes of violence.  Any person with any understanding of history knows the premise is ridiculous.  Hitler went to Paris once and never returned.  He would definately not have gone after the Normandy invasion.<br /><br />Its too ridiculous to even enjoy as a suspension of disbelief.
0007477155|5.0|I was expecting used books. I was expecting them to be a little worn, but they were in perfect condition and I couldn't be happier. They came in a timely fashion and I have no complaints. Just got into the first book and I am so excited to read more!
1451695195|5.0|Don't listen to all the naysayers. You follow his journey through his illness, which some complain about, but it is information that is necessary to understand his incredible experience. I, too, wish there had been more about the afterlife but his experience is much more significant because of who he is and the illness he had. The best confirmation so far.
0345803493|5.0|It was everything I expected plus more. A very good read. I was saddened that it was only a trilogy. I wanted to read more.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|I love the fact that this album has almost as many one star reviews as five star ones. A deeply divided listening public? I reckon a split between more conservative and progressive audiences. Between 'consumers' and lovers of cutting edge music, perhaps...? Let's not forget hip hop was THE sea change in pop culture back in the day. The pioneers always had something fresh to offer. But apart from some stand-out exceptions, things have got a bit staid. Samey. Hip hop is getting lazy. Kanye, though, has always got Next. Each album has got more complex, challenging, difficult... But why not? Yeezus has brilliant cut-ups and car crashes of music - but the beats are not exactly new. A lot of dance music is constantly progressing, and Kanye borrows liberally. But, a lot of this is new to hop hop, which is probably what is bothering a lot of those one star reviewers. Well, stick to what you know, and leave this to the lovers of real music. Real (ahem) art. Yes, Yeezus is fantastic. I want to listen to it over and over, which is more than I can say for most new music. And if you don't get the humour in here ('hurry up with my damn croissants'), leave it alone. It ain't for you.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|How do you pass the second level. This game is hard and addicting. If. Anyone can tell me how id be happy to know. Thank you
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is fun and addicting.  I didn't want to stop. I just wanted to keep going to the next room!
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|Wow. How come so many people believe this game to be enjoyable and waste so much time playing this ridiculous game? No wonder Americans are so uncultered. No wonder nobody in my history class can locate India of Mecca on a map.<br />You have, like, three tries to knock down this structure and smash the green little pigs. I got bored real fast.<br />I should delete this.<br />I would not download this again if they paid me to.<br /><br />Oh, there are other people like me, that realize the absurdness of this app.
B00005O3VD|3.0|The soundtrack is fun to listen to. Lots of classic Broadway songs to get your toes tapping. You can't go wrong with Barbara.
0399160450|5.0|Have purchased all his books & am always amazed at his technical knowledge!<br />One great author , never a dull moment.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|This 20th anniversary production of Phantom is top notch. The singing is stellar. The set is fantastic. It is fabulous!
B000JZ68GG|5.0|Ok...yea, nobody will agree with that.  But it is interesting to see old space movies like Barbarella, or Flash Gordon.
1781162646|5.0|Love the characters. Well researched.  Interesting to me as I have carny friends. Makes me want to go to Joyland.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|Just starting to get the hang when it ended! Could do with a bit more, but then it was only around 60p.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I  LIKE THIS GAME VERT MUCH.  I really enjoy all the new added scences that were not in the first temple run.
B008220BLG|4.0|I'll be honest -- when I first heard about this movie my reaction was \\"Oh no, it's 'Twilight' with zombies.\\"  After seeing the various classic horror monsters be softened and turned into romantic male leads, I cringed at the thought of a zombie romance film.  The trailers warmed me up a little to the concept, however -- it seemed the film would be playing the concept for laughs rather than a straight romance, and I could see all kinds of potential for hilarity.  And after so many deadly-serious zombie films in recent times (\\"28 Days Later\\" and the upcoming \\"World War Z,\\" for starters), it would be nice to have a comedic, tongue-in-cheek zombie film.<br /><br />I finally saw \\"Warm Bodies\\" last night, and to my surprise it's a lot better than I thought it would be.  It's not perfect and tends to fall into clich&eacute;s at parts, but it's a surprisingly sweet film that doesn't take its concept too seriously.<br /><br />Our protagonist is R, a zombie who lives in an airport and spends his days shuffling around, exchanging grunted conversation with a fellow zombie, and listening to music when he's not hunting for prey.  His mundane, undead existence is shaken up one day when, while on a hunt, he spots a beautiful girl among a group of survivors.  After eating her boyfriend's brains (a process that lets a zombie look into the memories of his or her victim), he learns more about the girl, Julie, and begins to fall in love with her.  At first she's put off by his attempts to woo and protect her, but gradually she realizes that though dead, he's not the monster she expected him to be.  And as their friendship develops, both realize that a remarkable change is coming over R... and that if they're to save both the undead and the rest of humanity from the Bonies (a race of skeletal super-zombies), they have to find a way to convince humanity that the undead can be saved.  If Julie's overprotective father doesn't put a bullet in R's head first...<br /><br />Yeah, the plot is essentially \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" in a zombie-apocalypse world.  (Even the protagonists' names, R and Julie, are a nod to the play that made me facepalm when I recognized it.)  But it's pulled off surprisingly well here.  Both young leads are good actors, and Nicholas Hoult does a superb job at playing R, somehow maintaining a slack-jawed \\"zombie face\\" and still managing to emote at the same time.  Teresa Palmer, as Julie, does well too as a young woman trying to maintain some sense of a normal life even as the world crumbles around her.

(Even the protagonists' names, R and Julie, are a nod to the play that made me facepalm when I recognized it.)  But it's pulled off surprisingly well here.  Both young leads are good actors, and Nicholas Hoult does a superb job at playing R, somehow maintaining a slack-jawed \\"zombie face\\" and still managing to emote at the same time.  Teresa Palmer, as Julie, does well too as a young woman trying to maintain some sense of a normal life even as the world crumbles around her.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Howey's Silo Saga rates up there with Asimov's Foundation trilogy and Herbert's Dune.  He has created a fictional, but absolutely believable world.  From start to finish it had me hooked.  I can't say enough good about the series.  Read it.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Entertaining game that was difficult to put down! The only problem was that I was surprised by how short the game was overall. I would have given it 5 stars if it would have lasted longer.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I absolutely loved everything about these first five installments of the Silo Saga.  Enthralling read....great character development, incredible plot.  Everything I could want in a postapocolypic dystopia.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|major crime show buff and really enjoy this program.  great detective work and good story lines.  I would highly recommend.
B00B2YH7BS|5.0|Just to set the record straight, I do not own one Foo Fighter nor Nirvana record. As a mid-fifty year old who plays guitar at Church, I love this Dave Grohl guy! Anyone who is into music would enjoy this movie, I've seen it twice and am about to purchase the Blue Ray.
B003L16FAE|4.0|Tremendous. Arnold and his team of private commandos go on what they think is a rescue mission only to learn they are being hunted by a being from the stars. Turns out they need to rescue themselves!
B00785P2QC|4.0|its a game that is going to end up costing you real money.  if you don't mind paying then this is the game for you.
B00AEBB9V4|5.0|This is simply a brilliant movie, one of Burton's best. He took a simple story, added a brilliant back story, casted it well and went on his way. Excellent performances all the way through and a creepy dark air worthy of a Hammer film.
B003TTMFCK|5.0|This season 6 was exciting and sad at the same time.  Mourning death and receiving new cast members to the show of which some likeable and some not so.  Changes amass in this season.  All in all a great season 6 of Grey's Anatomy.  You won't want to miss one episode.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|J. Cole just keeps going all in. This was a step up from his last album and at this rate this guy is paving the way for hip hop. The variety of music on here is nice too; you got some songs that go hard like Villuminati and Ain't that Some S*** and others are just chill relaxing tracks while other ones are just damn catchy. I really like how his albums sort of tell stories too. Great buy. No regrets. Do yourself a favor and support this artist at the same time: buy this CD!
B00D3V5V7U|4.0|The album overall is great. The band with Ozzie sounds great and it hearkens back to a time long gone. The tempo seems slower and more somber. While this could be just to help Ozzie, I think it is also has to do with the tone of the songs, which are more reflective and introspective than I have been used to. Overall a good album, just don't think you are going to hear Paranoid-esce songs.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really like this game, have already finished the game but it was really. If ur really smart I don't think u should this game because I thought it was easy, it took me a day but I took breaks.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|THE THREE BOOKS ARE GREAT.  It only took me about four days to read the series.  Can't wait to get more of her books.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I have never had a game that was so laggy.Even on the iPhone it is the Worst game ever.I think the people who made this should get of there lazy @$$e$,and fix.
B000SEI230|5.0|I have never written a review  before, but would like to take the opportunity to encourage anyone, male or female, to read this book. What a beautiful story of a young man learning the blessed truth of finding the joy of giving.  I was deeply touched and truly enjoyed every page, even through my tears. Sparks has such a gift.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|this app is very addictive. it is a lot of fun but u have to be patient. some things that u need take a long time to collect but u don't HAVE to buy anything with real money
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Entertaining and amazing no matter how many times you try it. I use it by asking my friends the questions and they cannot believe &#34;I&#34; get the correct answer every time.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|There were some good surprises this season. I would recommend it. I would recommend this product to anyone who enjoyed the previous seasons.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very good game . Keeps the mind thinking. You will be amazed with how hard you have to look to figure these puzzles out. Highly recommended app.
B001NHNG64|4.0|I would recommend this book, in fact all the Reacher books in the series. If you like these books you would like John Sandford books also.
B00CX1TPF0|4.0|This movie had a good storyline. There were only a few cuss words so you don't have to worry about that.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|it readwas a favorite..very well written...i have read kite runner and 1000 suns and i enjoyed them both..really recommendread this summer
B007N85POS|4.0|Fun and challenging game to play.  Bright clear graphics and lots of moving parts.  Also lots of levels to keep you going.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|Brings back great memories of childhood.  My kids watched it and in spite of some bad language loved it a lot.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My husband and I both enjoy this game. Entertaining!  I highly suggest this one to keep you thinking... what's next?
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|This is a beautifully spun tale. I loved every minute and lingered over the last few pages because I didn't want it to end.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I have always hated Batman. Every movie I had seen was campy, cheesy and worthless. My Wife one day brought Batman Begins home and I reluctantly watched it with her. I was won over instantly! Great story, realism and no camp or cheese! All three of the movies have made my favorite of all time list. I can care less about the comics or other movies, Christopher Nolan in my opinion gave me a Batman I can love. The Movies on Blue Ray are pure delight. This set is an excellent choice for those who love good movies presented in an absolute grand quality presentation. My wife hates it when I watch these movies now because the sound reverberates through the house. The sound is fantastic! The picture is absolutely stunning! I do wish there were more extra's but I do not feel like I was ripped off either.<br />I say if you want a good film based on a comic one needs to turn to Christopher Nolan. The man seems to be a genius in making these films. I cannot wait to see more of his work!
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|This is such a clever show. The twists and turns remind me of the great writing from the series 24. I absolutely love ryan and joe carroll!
B0053O89JM|4.0|I love House! The main complaint I have with the final season is the lack of Cuddy. In the last Episode when House is in the burning building trying to decide \\"to be or not to be\\" Cuddy should have been one of his visitors. Cuddy obviously had more of an impact on House than some of the others. I want more House. Maybe a Movie to explain what is next for House after the demise of his series long best victim (friend).
B008GXHOFW|1.0|I purchased this game at a discount. At $.99 I thought it was worth buying. Turns out it was a waste of money even at that price. The game crashed every time I've tried to play it.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|This is the ultimate zombie story! The walking dead is what a zombie film should be. Even if you do not like zombie films the characters make this a worth while watch. It is about survival! Darrel better be given series immortality because he seriously makes this show!
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|A bit predicable . . . I like most of the actors in this movie, #1 reason why I watched it.  But, it is a bit predicable.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|This is the darkest Britney Spears album to date in a sense that it was mad through the Legend's darkest life period but as you will hear it's Tracks you will realize why this album is considered as the Album that changed the face of Music.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A thoroughly enjoyable tale that keeps you guessing to the end. Hard to put down as the mind of Grisham spins another detailed story that you never see coming.
B004LFO0FG|5.0|I love Britney Spears and even for non fans this is the type of album to appeal especially to those who love Electronic Dance Pop music joined in one album.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|well I don't exactly hate it but I was in bed and I wanted to play a game so I got out my kindle I saw this game so I down loaded the game and all it did was annoy the heck out of me I couldn't get past level 5 and I couldn't get any hints or help.
B008DVJNYW|5.0|This album really is amazing and it continues with the path that ...Baby One More Time was heading in terms of genre and everybody knows how good ...Baby One More Time is !!!
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Sir Arthur's Sherlock Holmes is such an interesting personality. He and his partner in sleuthing, Dr. Watson, weave fascinating stories, short in length but strong in prose. These stories stand the test of time.
B008DVJOPK|5.0|This is the album where Spears experimented with new genres and with new producers. It is also the album that shows you the change from a teenage Britney to a young lady Britney.
B00BDRJ3Z2|4.0|This is another fun entertaining album by Luke Bryan!  One of those great albums to plug in and dance around the kitchen while cooking.  Songs are fun and just a really entertaining album.
B007V4QL5G|5.0|This is the album where Spears had the most experimentation in terms of the voice and genres which ranges from Pop R&B Hip-Hop and there are also Ballads.
0887307280|5.0|I am looking at starting a franchise, and this book is a must for the entrepreneur.  Great read, doesn't get boring.  You wll find this book a great resource, and money well spent to read it.
B0079J27SS|5.0|I grew up in the 1960s before period performance practice became common.  Very early on I became dissatisfied with big band classical period performance.  I went on to study bass fiddle with a member of the Cleveland orchestra and became a fan of the Cleveland Orchestra's classical period performance style.  I wasn't sure what to expect from Klemperer, whose Mahler recordings I had enjoyed as a teenager. But Wow!  These Mozart symphonies are elegant and lithe, with no mannerisms disturbing the basic pulse.  The orchestra plays with a silken tone,  but without throbbing vibrato.  These recordings are a perfect introduction to Mozart's masterpieces.  I do wish Maestro Klemperer had taken the repeats in first movements. Highly recommended.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|A wonderful slice of Americana.  Penny Tweedy continually spoke destiny over Secretariat and he more than lived up to it. If you liked Seabiscuit, you'll love this!
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|Great movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is a shame that they made the gorgeous Mila Kunis into an ugly witch. :)
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|Very slow moving and difficult to follow. Outstanding actors couldn't rescue a very confusing plot. I could not recommend this to anyone.
B000NYT1M6|5.0|My grandson loves this gift, and will use it a lot this summer. It looks to be fairly sturdy, and should stand up to rough play.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Engaging and imaginative. My only complaint is that the story wasn't longer. All I can ask is that Gaiman provides us with more of his fantastic imagination soon.
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|The app won't even be on for a full 30 seconds &amp; then it crashes. Every single time! At least it was the free app of the day, so I haven't wasted any money on this.
B00821OX98|5.0|So, I hadn't really heard much about this show. The Walking Dead has garnered much of my attention so my brain was more occupied by the undead than an alien incursion. However, I saw ads for the 3rd season a thought I would give season 1 a test drive. WOW!!! The first couple episodes take a little time to develop, but once the momentum picks up it doesn't stop. Noah Whyle does an amazing job and the supporting cast adds great character depth. Love it!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|my niece, nephew and I played 9 levels and then that was the end of the game. We liked it but wish there was MORE!!!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Great camera bag!  Has dividers in large compartment for camera, lens and other equipment.  Lots of pouches and compartments for accessories.  I got this bag because it didn't have a camera's name brand on it...which would have been a neon sign to theives.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Tatiana Maslany is an amazing actor. Of course, so are the others. I love Jordan Gavaris as Felix. The characters are fantastic, writing is excellent...hope there will be more episodes next season.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Once again, Sanderson creates a cast of colorful characters that draw you deep into the twists of a plot, the inner struggles of a protagonist, and the marvelous mechanics of a mind blowing magic system. Well done, Brandon!
B00007E7K0|5.0|I lost the lens cap on my and my husband's SLR camera. I wasn't allowed back home until I found it.  This wonderful replacement cap fixed my problem and saved my marriage!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Great show, if you're into Season 3, nothing I say is going to change the fact you're going to watch it.  Good TV, I think at times, this season doesn't get to a point.  I won't say more to risk spoiling anything for you.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|Pudding Monsters, from the makers of Cut the Rope, is cute.  It is easy to pick up.  The levels are progressively more difficult but it keeps your interest in the game.  I frequently delete games because I quickly grow bored, but this has kept my interest for several weeks now.
B007DIQC90|5.0|I love the music...the tone and sound are so different from the everyday songs on the radio...this cd is a refreshing breath of fresh air.
B001GQ2BNQ|5.0|This product is epic, it enables me to breathe under water and I don't have to hold my breath too long.
B0037NVM2C|3.0|My problem is with why make Arnold a good guy? The other, how is he a machine? he has no parts, melts together and has unlimited power. He is more supernatural than a machine. I liked t1 the best and 4 salvation is very good. skip the others. unless you can just let it not make sense. I guess if you can believe time travel then why not the rest. great action anyways.
B0028AQLYE|5.0|This product enables water from coming into the snorkel, this is novel idea, this product could keep you from getting water in your mouth.
B00005ATZT|5.0|One of those above average thrillers that caught on with audiences and critics and reached astounding peaks for a film in this genre, `The Fugitive' is one of those widely known and generally liked films that doesn't hold up to the reputation that comes from an Oscar winning film and yet never really disappoints.  It's an exciting film that delivers the goods, and while I don't understand how this made the shortlist for categories like Best Picture and Supporting Actor (first off, Tommy Lee Jones is a Lead here, and second he does nothing in the movie), I can't help but kind of love this movie.<br /><br />Expertly crafted, `The Fugitive' tells the story of Richard Kimble, a doctor whose life is flipped upside down when his wife is murdered and he winds up being charged with her murder.  Claiming that a one armed man did it, he's basically laughed out of court and into handcuffs, but a botched breakout leaves him a free man (sort of) and so he sets off to clear his name and find his wife's killer.  The whole time he has Samuel Gerard on his tale, hunting him down like a dog.  A couple close calls later, Kimble is able to uncover the real reason his wife was murdered, exposing his true friends and his real enemies.<br /><br />Ford is very impressive here.  He carries this film on his shoulders and manages to shed his stern facial features long enough to actually emote serious pain and suffering.  You can feel him in every scene.  The rest of the cast pales in comparison.  Tommy Lee Jones has presence, but he's just there and doesn't really stand out with Ford dominating the film.  The supporting players like Joe Pantoliano, Jeroen Krabbe and Julianne Moore are effective if a tad forgettable.  The real star of the show is Andrew Davis. He builds such palpable tension in every frame and creates a film that flows from scene to scene and keeps the audience engaged.  It's sad that his film was honored with an Oscar nomination for Best Picture and yet he was snubbed in favor of Jim Sheridan.<br /><br />It stands the test of time and remains and exhilarating film.  It's one of those films that is very easy to watch time and time again, thanks to the swift pacing and attention to detail.r of Jim Sheridan.<br /><br />It stands the test of time and remains and exhilarating film.  It's one of those films that is very easy to watch time and time again, thanks to the swift pacing and attention to detail.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book put me in Hannahs shoes and around her world. Allowing me to see her life through her eyes. I recommend this book to everyone!
B00CV5ZPA2|3.0|Kanye West has talent.  You may hate to admit that, but the proof is in the pudding so-to-speak.  Quite honestly, if he wasn't talented he wouldn't have a career, since let's face it, no one likes him as a person.  His last album was a sheer masterpiece, and he continues to push boundaries as an artist and this makes him relevant musically, not just as a celebrity.  Sadly, maybe the largeness of his head and the current Kardashian status he's attained has affected his work, because `Yeezus' is far from the masterpiece he is capable of producing.<br /><br />From a purely creative and engaging standpoint, `Yeezus' is prime.  The production angle on this album is insanely good.  He spits his flow fluidly and with aggression and we enjoy that.  He makes intricate fight music, music that pumps you up but that feels unique and progressive.  He wants to push boundaries, musically, and it shows all over `Yeezus'.  Sadly, looking at this as a whole can be rather upsetting.  While it is dripping with style, there is NO substance here.<br /><br />Honestly, I can find more substance in a Ke$ha song.<br /><br />Instead of trying to find a way to make his music relevant from thoughtful and lyrical perspective, Kanye is apparently happy with regurgitating the same phrases, themes and concepts over and over again.  Apparently he is god and women want to sleep with him.  There is nothing else of note here.  I want to know what Kim has to say about this.  Actually, I don't, but really I can't see how any woman wouldn't be offended by the lyrical assault Kanye thrusts in their direction.  He's careless with his lyrics, and it's shocking really.  He's been so much better than this in the past, and the lack of depth and the fact that he's regressed to the point of being seriously tacky is bizarre.<br /><br />Also, bring him his croissants already so he can stop yelling!<br /><br />Yes, I'm trashing this mainly because I expected so much more.  When you have artists like Macklemore raising the bar and actually producing tracks with depth and meaning you can't rest on your laurels.  You can't just hand us ten tracks produced to perfection and expect us to ignore the fact that you say absolutely nothing on it.  He sounds like an idiot, which isn't new for him and yet he's usually at least brought a level of intrigue and originality to his professional ventures.<br /><br />Kanye, you'd do well to remember the last person who thought he was `close to God'.  His name was Satan, and that whole thing didn't go over too well.ng the bar and actually producing tracks with depth and meaning you can't rest on your laurels.

B00CNKPBBI|5.0|With great sadness, I read about Vince Flynn's passing today; it was hard to hear that one of America's great action, spy writers had left us way before his time. My prayers are with him and his family, he brought a different kind of hero into our reading spectrum. Stay the course in God's wake, you'll be greatly missed, thank you for an excellent style of writing...

B006RXPTNM|4.0|Exactly what I expected from these fabulous actors! Watched the whole movie and had doubt....Streep made me wish there were more of her for all those victims that endured the horrors. Seymour made me analyze all that he said and did. Like I said I had doubt.

B00BAYLQI0|1.0|Where should I begin....acting really sucks!!!  The whole movie was just about finding their own family....I especially hated the ending.  I won't spoil for those want to watch this movie.  But, this is one of the worst movie I ever purchased.  Don't waste your money.  Let me know if anyone wants this movie and I'll be glad to send to you.
159463176X|4.0|I am going to start by saying that Khaled Hosseini has been one of my favorite contemporary authors, and this fact did not change after reading his third novel despite the slight disappointment that accompanied it.<br /><br />And the Mountains Echoed is a very complex novel about bonds between family members; brother and sister, mother and son; father and daughter. It's about making difficult and often incorrect choices and their long-lasting consequences.<br /><br />What I liked: the writing that flowed beautifully; the metaphors and the imagery; the first chapter with a compelling beginning, the characterization of the lost Pari and her unstable mother, Naila.<br /><br />There are about 6 rather loosely connected stories. The individual stories are good: they explore touching themes: rivalry between twin sisters; resentment between patient and caregiver; sadness of separation; aging of parents; guilt of abandoning those who need you most; challenges of raising your children in a culture that's not yours. The unfairness of life is well depicted-the privilege of wealth, health and beauty shaping some lives, while the dearth of these very same things destroys others.<br /><br />Naila Wahditi's interview was very intelligently written.<br /><br />What I didn't like: It seemed as if this was a collection of short stories, because they were not directly connected with the main story, some were not connected at all. There were about 35 characters in the book, which is too big a number for me as a reader to grasp, because it feels like going into several different tangents and dilutes my connection with the main characters. I would have liked to feel more connected with Abdullah and Pari (as I did with Amir and Hasan from TKR and Maryam and Laila from ATSS). The flipping between past and present tense was also distracting at times.<br /><br />Also, C section incisions although horizontal today, were commonly vertical in the time (and place) described, (though I may be wrong.)<br /><br />There were some very beautiful pieces of writing, I am quoting some of them that really struck me:<br /><br />Aging: \\"The moment is brief, barely enough for a flutter of the pulse but long enough for her illusory self to catch up with the reality of the woman gazing back from the shopwindow...That is what aging is...these random unkind moments that catch you when you least expect them.\\"<br /><br />A mother's disappointment in her son: \\"She regarded me not with anger but with a disheartened look. Resignation. Like a sculptor finally dropping mallet and chisel, giving up on a recalcitrant block that will never take the shape he'd pictured.\\"<br /><br />What guides our decisions: \\"It's a funny thing..but people mostly have it backward. They think they live by what they want. But what really guides them is what they're afraid of. What they don't want.\\"<br /><br />Fear of the unknown:\\" I have lived like an aquarium fish in the safety of a glass tank, behind a barrier as impenetrable as it is transparent.....am terrified that when it breaks, when I am alone, I will spill out into the wide open unknown and flop around, helpless, lost and gasping for breath.\\"<br /><br />Hosseini's writing continues to be a great inspiration.

B005H9B2CE|5.0|Great movie! It is interesting to see how \\"whoever is worthy\\" of the hammer becomes fulfilled. Thor's arrogance gives way to humility and he regains the power he had lost. I am Loki g forward to the sequel to this.

B00BCOQSSQ|5.0|First of all, they say never to judge a book by its cover, but that is the reason I wanted to read it.  This book took me a long time to read-not because I disliked it, but because I read it on the Amazon app of my laptop.  Huff's writing is clear, fast-paced, and addictive.  Told in first-person of Owen and also third-person, the reader is taken into an imaginary world that reminded me of The Hobbit and Alice in Wonderland with a splash of Game of Thrones thrown in.  I might be crazy, but I sensed a very faint hint of Stephen King's 11/22/63.  Unlike the afore books mentioned, Huff gets to the point without wasting thousands of words of \\"page-filler\\" in useless descriptions, details, etc.  I loved the pace.  Owen and his two friends save the world in a captivating adventure.  The characters and creatures were well-developed.  I especially liked the Keeper.  Huff is extremely creative while giving the theme of good and evil a fresh new look.  The pillars nicely set up the story for a series.  Everything about the book is professional and well-done.  I would highly recommend this book for anyone who likes fantasy and adventure.  I cannot wait for the sequel.  5/5 Stars

B0033QC0WE|5.0|When back in the early 90's I first heard the name of John Eliot Gardiner's new orchestra, I admit I was a skeptic.  Orchestre R&eacute;volutionnaire et Romantique?  Come on, there's not much of anything romantic about a revolution.  There's plenty of blood though.  Anyway, I was dismissive of the great orchestra simply because of a weird name.  That was before I got to hear how they play though.  First Berlioz, then Brahms, and then - this magnificent set now available for pennies on amazon.<br /><br />Just about that time a wonderful film \\"Immortal Beloved\\" came out featuring Sir Georg Solti's Beethoven renditions in its soundtrack.  Ever since then, I could not imagine Beethoven played slowly and \\"grandly\\".  The blood-and-guts Beethoven, the intense rebel and the first rocker, if you will, needs to go for the jugular, relentlessly moving forward to an earth-shattering climax, may it be tragedy of the 5th or triumph of the 9th.  For some reason, Solti's recorded Beethoven's cycles (on Decca) lacked that aspect a little compared to the soundtrack. Carlos Kleiber recorded a full-throttled 5th and 7th (DG) and unfortunately stopped there, but the sound was quite poor, actually distracting from the performance (I hear the remastered \\"Orininals\\" version is better in that regard). Gardiner's set, even aside from being recorded using original instruments, has exactly this quality, in spades actually.<br /><br />Download the samples of the 3rd, 5th, and 7th to get a taste.  There's no way to check, but I really think Beethoven wanted his music played exactly this way - with plenty of raw energy, power, and passion. And the original full-bodied instrumentation turned out not to be a gimmick - it adds significantly to the impact.  By the way, this is a reverse of what you would typically experience with period instruments, for instance Beethoven's own piano concertos were performed on a fortepiano, of course, not on a modern Steinway grand, and its sound is quite a bit smaller next to the full orchestra; check out Gardiner/ORR recording with Robert Levin to get a feel for it.  But in this recording the strings and winds sound much warmer, the timpani - more resonant, but cleaner than their modern equivalents. Amazing detail.  The treble \\"sheen\\" that's present on nearly all modern-instrument recordings of these symphonies, including some well-celebrated sets, is absent.  On first listen it will give you a start, but later you'll find other versions annoying.  The oft-played Allegretto from Symphony #7 is particularly interesting in this regard, there's something magical about its tragic chords \\"floating\\" through the space. I am not a huge fan of LvB's early symphonies (1&2), but they're delightful here, played technically perfect, with Mozartean sweetness but tingled with a sense of urgency. By the time Eroica blasts off, that sweetness is all but gone, only to reappear briefly in the Pastoral more for contrast than anything. The under-rated #8 is taut and energetic, it's actually amazing that Beethoven at 41 was quirky and fun, the qualities this recording brings out fully.<br /><br />The Ninth is a bit of an odd-duck.  Nearly all the conventional tempi the listeners are accustomed to are gone.  The first movement, for instance, is really fast: those of us used to the renditions of Bohm, Fricsay, or Furtwangler will be surprised it's just 13 minutes compared to their 16-18!  But the storm really takes off, and then the whole symphony comes off very energetic, strong and triumphant, though noticeably less boomy/brassy and much crisper than what we're used to. I would think it's bound to polarize the listeners much more than the rest of the cycle.<br /><br />Finally, for the presentation of this CE.  Nice, sturdy outer-box, good booklet, but terrible flimsy CD sleeves with zero information on them.  At least in the past DG would include pictures of a conductor or a composer or basic track list.  No such luck here.  On a plus-side thoughthe box is very slim, about ½ inch, so it will save a lot of space on your shelf for more great recordings.  For those of us who still prefer real CDs instead of downloadable or cloud-based files this is a happy compromise formula: less bulk + great music= great price.ox is very slim, about ½ inch, so it will save a lot of space on your shelf for more great recordings.

B00C061I3K|4.0|This is really a great album, but I think it doesn't live up to the standards DP have set for themselves. There are some really good songs like Touch and Instant Crush. It would have been Fantastic as an early album, but not right now.

B00729GQ0A|5.0|The first few chapters were such a build up for where the story line was headed, I couldn't remember what was written in the synopsis, so I was extremely unaware of what was coming up next, and where the story was going.<br /><br />It took me a while to read it but every time I started I didn't want to stop, I just had to know what was happening next.<br /><br />Had lots of different twists and turns that kept you intrigued, and wondering what was on the next page.<br /><br />This book is the first one that physically gave me chills down my spill, always checking no-one was watching me, I felt stupid once I realized it contained blood suckers lol.<br /><br />Overall I loved it and I can't wait to read the book 2

B003YL4LYI|1.0|I think he is milking his fame . One would think he was being played by the word.listing the names of all the people in a room,,please.he keeps adding characters rather than developing the ones he has. This  ending was scattered and it felt as though he simply gave up trying to bring it all together.I almost didn't bother to buy this one. I should have followed my instincts. It a shame.the first book was truly well done,but each successive book became less and less satisfying.his description of things,people and places are wonderful.

B009RH9FR6|4.0|I find the Kindle Fire HD too thin and slick to comfortably hold as if I were reading a book for an extended period of time, so a case was definitely needed. I have a first Gen Kindle with a nice case (I know, old school), and I was looking for something along the same lines in width for the new Kindle. This case is a little thicker than what I was originally looking for, but I'm glad I got it. I actually like the thickness of this case better, and it seems to offer a good amount of protection if dropped. The Fire HD fits snugly and I dont see any issues with it slipping out. The rotating platform works nicely. Originally I thought the only benefit was switching between portrait and landscape, but the real benefit is allowing it to charge while still in the case. A lot of the other cases I looked at didnt offer this. I compared this against quite a few cases (on Amazon and at the store), and this is the one that seemed to be the best. On top of that, the price was pretty reasonable. All in all, a very good buy.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it four stars instead of 5 was because the leather on the front of the case was creased in two places. But its just a cosmetic issue and nothing that wouldnt have happened anyway within the next two weeks after my 5 year olds first rousing game of Angry Birds.

B00A3DZ61W|5.0|When Angry Birds first came out, I didn't understand the hoopla. I played the game a few times, but it didn't seem all that fun to me. It wasn't until I played ANGRY BIRDS STAR WARS that I understood the error of my ways. ANGRY BIRDS STAR WARS takes the Angry Birds game and places it within the Star Wars universe. Follow the path of the original Star Wars trilogy. At this time, the game has series of levels that follow STAR WARS and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. Rovio is working on updates that are released every couple of months, so I expect that eventually you'll be able to play levels that reflect RETURN OF THE JEDI, too. Overall, it's a really fun game that is highly addictive, especially to pass the time away playing on your smartphone.

B00124DUA0|5.0|We all know the main theme, but if you've enjoyed the Christopher Reeve original movie, this has the full musical score from every scene.<br /><br />Nobody can match John Williams for writing scores with thematic melodies that find your way into head, and instantly evoke the particular scenes they accompanied, and remain immediately recognizable whenever you hear them.<br /><br />Anything by John Williams is forever a winner.  Go buy the Soundtracks for the original Star Wars, Indiana Jones, E.T., Jurassic Park, and everything else John Williams has had a direct hand in, after this one.  There's a reason John Williams is responsible for scoring the most iconic films of all time.  It's a chicken and egg question whether the success of the film makes the music more memorable, or whether the impact of the score is what ensures the the film is celebrated as having a lasting legacy.  In the case of John Williams, I lean strongly toward the latter.
B006QPX6IG|5.0|While some say that the movie is long, I agree.  It tells a story that takes place over 3 days.  There are several important people involved in this battle: Lee, Pickett,  John Buford, John Reynolds and Joshua Chamberlain.  I found that the extended version (The Director's Cut) has severl imporltant scenes that were deleated but in my opinion should not have been.  Unlike Gods and Generals the extended cut is not worth adding the deleated scenes.  The fact that important scenes were actually filmed at Gettysburg adds to the importance of the film.  It is a shame that Hollywood does not do the Civil War justice.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Ditto my review of Book Three<br /><br />In spite of my resentment of the author killing off people I love or admire - or introducing another 150 characters to sort out and learn their idiosyncrasies, I read on.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|I find the writing of George r.r. Martin to be totally absorbing even when I'm so tangled up in characters, families and clans I don't know which way is up.  I've read the books twice to try and get a better handle on the characters and it has helped.  I remember the plot in a general way but even so get all clenched up hoping that this time a character I've come to love or admire won't get killed but, they do.  I guess that's the definition of insanity, hoping that &#34;this time&#34; it won't happen when I've been here before, and it does.  AND - just when I think I've got a handle on the flow of characters, damn it if he doesn't introduce a whole new kingdom of people to follow.<br /><br />So, in spite of resenting these games the author plays, I read on and wait for the next book to come out.  I guess I'm hooked.

B00847KFDS|5.0|First off, I've always loved CCR so I'm sort of biased. But I'm also a purist and whenever someone says \\"Tom Fogerty wasn't very good\\" or these songs needed better musicianship, I remind them that the group was very popular and the songs were hits.  Now everyone is saying that this new CD features the songs the way they should have been played when they were released. Nonsense. The songs were played exactly how they should have been played back then.  But I have to admit that the new versions are great.  Sure they are the same songs but rock and country rock have come a long way since then and while John had his brother and band mates with all of the good things and all of the limitations they brought to the table back then, he now can pick and choose the artists with whom he wants to record. And he picked well. The result is some great artists who know how to play and how to kick it up a notch. Listen to edge that the Foo Fighters give to Fortunate Son and check out the use of a harmonica and organ by The Zach Brown Band on Bad Moon Rising and you'll know what I mean.  So this CD does not demonstrate the way the songs should have been played back in the 60s and 70s -  it is exactly the way they should be played in 2013.  So give a listen. This is not just a rehashing of someone's greatest hits but a reinvention of the songs and with it comes a rebirth for 2013.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I love AWKWARD.  It is such a good show. Reminds me of Sixteen Candles from the 80's. love the quirky characters and the teenage angst. Plus Anthony Michael Hall is a great addition to season 3.

0440246318|3.0|I am probably swimming upstream against the Jack Reacher fans out there. I've been a big fan myself, but the last couple of Lee Child books have been real snoozers. This one hooks you in and keeps the mystery going, but the Jack Reacher hero character just gets in a car and drives somewhere. Then he gets out of the car, gets back in and drives somewhere else. Lots of driving and tedious highway and America midland descriptions -- highways, cornfields, etc. etc. Very little real action except towards the end. As a Reacher fan in the past I enjoyed all the little wars and action scenes he encountered on the way to the conclusion, but this one has a lot of sitting around. I wanted to give this two stars, but the mystery and twists sort of redeemed the story, just barely. But I'm afraid this one is too formulaic to redeem my interest in this series.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|Anyone who is a long time Black Sabbath fan will enjoy this album.  It is not their finest effort, but there is plenty to like.  I only wish Bill Ward was able to play along with Tony, Geezer and Ozzy, the current drummer does a great job on the stool, but the chemistry of the original quartet would have been awesome and I'm sure would have enhanced the overall experience.<br />The one thing I don't get is why a band of Black Sabbath's stature would allow this album to be released in so many different packages.  There is the 8 track version, the \\"deluxe edition w/ 3 bonus tracks on a 2nd disc\\" and the Best Buy \\"exclusive edition w/ 4 tracks on a 2nd disc\\".  Why not just release all 12 tracks on a single disc and charge a buck or two extra over the regular price?  Maybe it is about more money to be made, but the cost and hassle of all these various packages has to override the simple fact that the band and record company would have made plenty of money by releasing a single version with all the tracks.  Any money left on the table would have been recovered by touring.  That's my only complaint, the music on Black Sabbath 13 is more than a worthwhile spin for anyone who prefers their tunes on the \\"heavy side\\".  Enjoy.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I was amazed that this was a first novel. I couldn't stand to put it down. It kept me so interested that I wanted to get to the end as soon as possible and I also didn't want it to end. I am now a major Jack Reacher fan and have been reading Lee Child's Jack Reacher series one after the other.
0307352153|5.0|Very interesting, well-written book on the emphasis in our society from an emphasis on character and integrity to an emphasis on extroverts and how that change came about. An important book for anyone who feels they are introverted or raising a shy child or felt the pressure to change their personality type to fit a manufactured \\"norm\\" in our society.
B002SF9YNO|2.0|It is hardly fair of Amazon to advertise this as a pair with Babette's Feast, one of the all-time great films! This story does not really engage the audience and the \\"hero\\" is unconvincing. The cover photo of the cellist, firstly, is misleading, as the film has no good music, only one snippet of a so-so fragment which is repeated ad nauseam about one million times. This is to imply that our hero plays the cello. Frankly, after a while the audience is just hoping THE END is near.

B001JIFYSA|1.0|Good actors, really stupid movie.  Of note are January Jones and Elisha Cuthbert BEFORE they achieved noteriety on television.  It was difficult watching Liam Neeson as a widower on film, especially since that's the way it ended up for him IRL.<br /><br />Other than that, I detested Laura Linney's character.  One would hope that somebody who is so dominated by a mentally ill, institutionalized brother would actually turn their phone off before they are going to have sex.  I kept on hoping he'd commit suicide and free her from the storyline.  I detested Hugh Grant's character - honestly?  The British PM acting like this?  I could go on, but I won't.  Avoid this film.  Yuck!
B008G3N71W|2.0|This book was well written and edited which gained it a star in my rating. I had no clue where the author was going with the story, which earned it a second star for originality (at least in my limited experience). BUT...<br />If I had walked into a man's apartment and the first thing he did was slap me, that would be the last thing he did! Greta was looking for adventure, but total debauchery and degradation is not what I would call adventure. She didn't seem to mind it though, and just seemed happy to go along with anything, like a clean slate. She was only 19 for heaven's sake. Wasn't there anyone looking out for her? And all that sex, with no discussion about protection. I found that totally irresponsible.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Couldn't put this book down... Cleverly written story that allows the reader to fully use their imagination.  You don't have to be into the zombie genre to love this book. Great to read on the beach or on your long commute.  Chapters are nice and short for those who have a few minutes to read after the kids go to sleep.  I've recommended this book to everyone I know.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very well written original story.  The characters are fully fleshed and the tension is maintained well through out the novel.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Movie was okay.  Seemed the movie script was linked  as a prequel into original Oz movie, and followed similar plot devices of actors playing duel roles (in Kansas and Oz), but a little disappointed in special effects; though a lot of color, most effects did just seemed like actors in front of a green screen so realism illusion was not quite there.  But family and kids are older, so maybe movie still works will with pre-middle school age
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I watch this show while in on my treadmill or stationary & am getting in great shape as I can't wait to see the next episode!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love it, great game. If you enjoy bingo this is the game for you. Of all the games on facebook this one is my favorite.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Michael Chiklis plays the anti-hero to perfection. The Shield rewards viewers for investing their time. This is a &#34;don't miss&#34; series.
0316247545|5.0|We say the movie on Sunday and I got the book on Wed. She loves it and it makes her want to read, which is exactly the reason I purchased it for her.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy using this app on my Kindle Fire.  It's nice to have a large battery to tell me how much time I have left to know when to charge.
B000I3UAJ0|4.0|Though this film takes its own sweet time unfolding the story, and relies far too heavily on our expected awe of the visuals and circumstances to keep us entertained while not much is happening, it still may be one of the best Star Trek movies ever made.<br /><br />Why?  Because it is a scifi move and not a swashbuckling laser action fest.<br /><br />I love action movies, but I also love scifi and I really, really miss it.  At some point, I think we started blending the two to combine both forms of interest for a headier product, but soon thereafter action was all that was left.  Take the latest Star Trek film, Into Darkness.  It's great, but is more akin to a Die Hard movie in space than anything for which the original series or TNG was loved.<br /><br />So pick a quiet evening and make a cup of herbal tea.  Find yourself somewhere comfortable to lay and plan on falling asleep a couple of times.  But do check out Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
B002RZZIXU|4.0|This is a well written story of spying and disinformation during WW2. The language flows well and the characters and events are believable. The twist at the end ties up the story.
B00275EHJG|1.0|I'll just take a moment to agree with those who believe this movie to be a dark, depressing, mean spirited and overrated P.O.S.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book grabbed me from the onset, and I held on throughout for a great ride!  I expected it to be very upsetting, but being told from the point of view of a small child, it was not.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Keep it handy for kids at work. Very nice for the younger children.  I've also tried to play it ★so far haven't made it through the hills !!!
B0091REZMW|1.0|App wont open on my lg optimus s. Or on bluestacks on my computer. Had to uninstall from bot h.
B00873MSZ2|5.0|I had this movie at one point and it went missing, so finding this on Bluray for the price I got it for was amazing. It was even in a steel book case. I would definitely recommend this seller. The movie arrived well within the estimated time of delivery and was exactly as described on the page! Go check out this seller's selection!
0340822783|5.0|Loved the book, I loved the movie. I implore anyone into Buddhism or stories that intertwine to watch this movie !
B00821OX98|3.0|Good plot, but clearly a made for TV product. Enjoyed watching with minimal expectations. I view it as a combination of War of the Worlds and V.
B00CW665VI|4.0|Great read from the guy's perspective.  He wasn't an angel and was crass at times but this book is well worth the read.  Light and entertaining.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|Do not waste money on this one. Do not believe the blurbs and write ups. It's the worst fantasy I've read in years.
B001794FOK|5.0|EVERYTHING WORKED IN THIS SET.THE MOVIE WAS GREAT ALSO BUT HITMAN THE DIGITAL COPY DID NOT WORK.THECODE TO REGISTER HAD BEEN USED.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I feel as if I walked a steep tortuous mile in the sandals of an Afghan woman, felt all of the pain of decades of war on the innocents, the children, and been transformed forever.  This is an outstanding book.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|Very Buddhistic themes, I was glued to the screen for 3 hours. Several storylines, Tom Hanks, H Barre among a star studded cast playing multiple roles. Truly a cinematic masterpiece. &#34;Our lives are not our own, from womb to tomb we are bound o others. With every crime and kindness, we birth our future.&#34; Bought the DVD after seeing it on the big screen, bought the book after buying the DVD.
B00BI745AA|5.0|I confess I like musicals, but the way this was done made it even better. Superb! And I thought Russell Crowe more than delivered in his parts -- for a non-singer he did better than most of the &#34;singers&#34; I know.
B000YMSX76|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book very much. A very good read.  I will for sure pass this one along to my friends.
B008469DGY|5.0|This game was a lot greater than I thought! It helped me with my full swings and bunker shots. You should get it!! It inspired me to play golf.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|it was very like kane and able .dont think there will ever be a seceris of books ever again like that.would lovbe to see jeffrey werite something aS GRIPPING as that again.even after all these years i cant tell people how much they should buy them and get onr of the best of books to read .great page turner , cant wait for the next insalment, please never stop writeing.your truly kay hart dublin
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|This show is so well written and acted.  Tatiana Maslany will have you believing that each incarnation is a separate person.  I can't wait for the next season to come out.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The game was ok. It kept me guessing on every level. I look forward to new levels. Hope they come sooner than later
B0081336FO|5.0|witty and funny describe this series.  The plots are interesting and fun to watch.  Cant wait for the next season!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love puzzle games and hidden object games. this. game is so fun and not too hard. works great on my kindle.
B00632HWOG|4.0|No real issues, works well, rarely down. Sometimes hard to open large attachments but that could be the pad I use.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|Fantastic movie for adults and children.  Highly recommend you watch this movie again and again. It can fix any dull moment!
B001DUDKEY|3.0|I know this is a classic, but the story just sort of ambles along and didn't really keep my interest like Pride and Prejudice or many of the other Austen pieces.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is amazing it kept me thinking. Something I would play alot. It is a real brain teaser. I like to play games that help me streangthen my brain. This is a game that will deffinantly do that. I hope to see more levels soon because I really got into it.
B004ADF7RO|4.0|Good movie for the family, but the Statue of David scene and Spanish &#34;translations&#34; put the movie definitely in the PG-13 category.  Nice plot line and held your attention.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love playing this game with my kids we think it is great and fun to play we love all the different levels it has.
B0085YOD1A|3.0|Nothing that I already didn't have just fancier. If it weren't free I would not be happy!  Not worth the space
B00499QUK2|5.0|I find it very entertaining.  It is very interesting to watch how he unravels a case by observations.  I like the manner in which they hint at what he is observing.  It is very fast paced and these hints helped me to follow what was happening.  I found the speed of Sherlock's dialog (talks very fast) hard to catch at first but the more I watched the easier it was for me.<br /><br />The actor playing Watson does an outstanding job also.<br /><br />Very entertaining - I would recommend.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Ah, Jeffrey Archer is the best!  Only issue...too short!<br />  A fab read!<br />Loved the trilogy.  I hope there is a part 4!  So much more he could right about the family.
B003Y059EK|5.0|In my opinion, this was a very creative movie. It also had a sort of dark and creepy appeal to it (particularly the wheelers). Return to Oz definitely had a different style than the Wizard Of Oz. Also, there were many new and interesting characters introduced into this movie. However, I still found it to be really enjoyable. This movie may not be suitable for youngsters as there are many rather frightening scenes! Also, the chicken and the robot (tik-tok)are very humorous characters!! I highly recommend watching this movie with friends if you are looking for a good time!!
B002W7H3EA|5.0|A classic.  I have to watch it every few years to appreciate the genius of Hitchcock.  One of Grants best.
B003DDKAT2|1.0|This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen! I would not recommend it for anyone ever.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Unbelievably easy to use for fractions. I wish this was around when I was colllege! Thanks for the great app devs!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This was a good read and I couldn't put it down. It is not as good as A Thousand Splendid Suns but then I haven't read anything so far that come close to that wonderful book.  A good story and I hope Mr. Hosseini continues to entertain us with his future stories.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This is a nice yet challenging game.  You have the option of playing for speed or just relax and play.  It does not have an undo button however so scope out your moves carefully.  I don't like the 15 sec. Penalty for a reshuffle but it is what it is.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|I really really enjoyed this movie! It is the story of how the Wizard of Oz came to be! The graphics and colors were like eye candy. Also, in my opinion, it was very creative, and humorous. It was also filled with a lot of compassion at times. I also liked all of the characters! In my opinion, Mila Kunis, James Franco, Rachel Weisz, and Michelle Williams all rocked their performances! The China Girl was also one of my favorite characters. I will definitely be purchasing the DVD and I highly recommend watching this movie!!
B001XUH69Y|5.0|I watch this movie every few years.  It is Bogart to the hilt.  There is little to dislike with this movie.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|The Game of Thrones was definitely a great read. The characters names were a little confusing at first, but after a while they became familiar. Dark mysterious and colorful. I love the period, and the considerable attention to detail, bringing the scenes to life of this on going saga. I would highly recommend this book for readers that like historical fiction. But not to the exclusion of other readers; because any avid reader would find this book entertaining.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I have had a lot of fun playing this game. It has guessed almost everything I have thrown at it, even obscure characters.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this adaptation of Emma! I just felt very happy when I finished. Emma was always a favorite Jane Austen book of mine but I think it might have been influenced by my initial love of Clueless (no judging). This BBC version was able to cover so much more than the Gwyneth Paltrow movie and the acting was great.  The two leads, Knightly & Emma, were amazing and their interactions throughout the series were so simple yet sweet. It was exactly what I was hoping for when I clicked play. Previous versions of Emma made me wonder how they could fill 4 episodes but each episode flies by and you feel like you learn and understand the characters so much more than with the movies. Great choice, definitely worth watching!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|authentic interesting characters, good story, funny, and with a good message.  Shows what real craziness is and what it's not.
B003KVKQB4|1.0|Far too leftist for me. That is all your going to get. It is not worth the additional 15 words.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Watching it for the second time because I got my hubby into it! Never gets old. It's hard to watch it with him knowing what happens already!
B00CF2UORK|5.0|Love to watch this on my ipad.  Very cute and fun. I wish there were more seasons! Fun for all ages!
B0064MGU98|3.0|It is just a regular TV show nothing mind blowing. The story is predictable. She faces adversity and overcomes it. I don't recommend unless you are really bored out of your mind.
B00116FT6M|4.0|This movie is a fun and interesting musical about a girl chasing her dreams and standing up for the things she believes in.
B00933JL0A|5.0|I love this game it is so fun!!!! I barely play anything else anymore!!!! THE BEST!!!!!! TOWNIES FTW!!!!!!! :-D Love it!
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I found this book under recommendations on my account. So glad I tried it out. This book is a really interesting twist on Cinderella. Futuristic, Action, and of course romance. I didnt put this down under it was finished. I will gladly continue to read the series
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love the Hunger Games books!  Its great for most age groups - every book in the series was a page turner!
B007PJFIU6|5.0|Not a lot to say, Dixit is a fun artsy game, and the art on this one is much 'darker' than the others I've seen, but it certainly matches me, so I'm glad I got it!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|My child has one and she can set it anytime. My old alarm clock could only set at night so I decided to get this one. Very well put together. Bravo
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It's easy at first, then jumps on you with big feet with a tricky one. Fun to pass the time.
B008L5G4I8|5.0|To create such a list of characters on a first novel is remarkable. These will last for many more years to come.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|I think the 007 \\"formula\\" is wearing thin. The plot has become far too predictable and I thought the new Q was rather lame.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|the game is so much fun one of the best I played. I love the game even more than the regular angry birds.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|its challenging and fun. I like it. If you want a challenge this is the game tor you. Good for passing time.
1476733953|3.0|Feeling compelled to write my first negative book review on Amazon, because my faith in my fellow readers reviews is shaken. This book was recommended to me, and after reading the glowing reviews on Amazon, I thought I would give it a try. First of all, I commend the Hugh Howey on his back story for how he wrote the book, and for having the perseverence to get it published (no easy feat for any writer, I am sure). But this book was simply not what I expected. It started out fairly strong, leaving you lots of questions that you hoped would be answered. The concepts of everyone living in a silo, and the blasted planet all seem like they could really happen some day. But after the first couple of chapters, anything good about the story ends, or never actually really begins. The writer has some interesting characters, Juliette is full of determination. But all of the rest of the characters are ridiculously weak. No questions about how this society came to be are answered. And why would a character as devious as Bernard give the keys of the proverbial kingdom to someone as weak as Lukas? And what the heck with the allusion to Rome and Juliet? By the time I got to the last page and realized that NONE of my questions would be answered (especially after reading Juliette's multiple page ordeal of how she returned to dry ground after her air supply was cut off) I was quite annoyed that I had wasted my time. On a 5 star rated book. For sci-fi, 5 stars should be only given for books like 1984, or Ender's Game. I am being generous in giving this 3 stars, and that is only because of the time the writer spent writing and publishing it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Really enjoying great for waiting or just passing time! Easy to download and use. Nice selection of cards and backgrounds.
B004GTKP3S|5.0|Excellent performing and compact story lines. It is not trying to stretch out the story but pacted in.<br />Beautilly setted lighting and great landscape views.<br />Really love it. Hope soon Prime members can view Season 2 for free!! Cannot wait!!!
B0043RSK3K|5.0|This is a book with the latest information, substantiated by documents released through the Freedom of Information Act and by people who have known for years the truth concerning the events of World War 1 and 2, Vietnam, the events in Dallas in 1963, and now have come forward to share their first-hand knowledge.  This is a disturbing book, filled with facts, names, and documentation which can be overwhelming, but ultimately satisfying for the professional or amateur historian, scholar, or casual reader. The authors also explore the events leading to the war in Iraq and our current involvement throughout the world.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I watched this movie many times but I purchased it with the hopes that will allow my toddlers to learn more about dinosaurs. The move paid off. After watching these two movies, the two of them can recognize various types of dinosaurs and clearly differentiate them.<br /><br />They ended up with really lots of questions so I had a great time discussing the movie with them and talking about those things that they didn’t understand clearly such as where are they? What happened?<br /><br />The positive element about the movie is that there was a whole lot of science put into making the dinosaurs look like the ones that existed millions of years ago. A trip to the museums in Washington DC and NY completed the educational plan I had on mind when I place my order with Amazon.
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|The microphone was dead on arrival but a trip to Radio Shack for a new replacement battery seems to have resolved that issue... I wasn't excited about spending $7 on a battery not knowing if it would fix the problem or not so I'm releaved that it did (based on other reviews here, thanks). Now to order extra batteries, in bulk... and hope the mic works as well as advertised.
B009MEEZXI|5.0|Excellent movie...required with anyone who wants more information about autism. Temple Grandin has an amazing life story.  Don't miss this film.
B00ANGSSWS|3.0|I knew this before I bought the album and I hate concept albums but thought if anyone could pull it off, it would be these guys. No, the talk tracks suck the momentum out of it just like every other one I have heard. That doesnt mean its a bad album, its quite good, just not up to their other work. And if anyone was wondering who owns these clones it is made clear here. If you like BVB you will like this, just know that 6 tracks need deleted and that it is full of conditioning, like most of the music these days but less subtle than usual.
B004QYTRRS|4.0|The critics didn't like it much.  It's obvious the story and the directing is a bit lacking.  However, the scenery is very beautiful and you end the movie feeling good.  chic flick.
0670026557|5.0|I love the idea that you can be a nice guy and still excel in corporate america. I loved this book and go back it quite often
B008OM0EDO|4.0|I'd like to see him do something with the Occupy/Progressive crowd next.  That would actually be different. They may be the one political group that hasn't been poked fun at yet.
B00C061HZY|5.0|It's awesome when an artist records something thinking of vynil. A bunch of great musicians and producers put up together in one album.
B00BTLOOAQ|5.0|Amazing singing debut. Top jazz combo sound like old pros. Something new, something old, all of it fresh. Buy it!
B007PKOKTK|5.0|We loved it, kids loved it....perfect movie night in our house!  Great for watching on &#34;Easter Eve&#34;...has family favorite potential!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love that my weather shows up right on my drop down menu and that I can view the weather in different locations, especially when I'm traveling!
B006WXHJNU|5.0|Stunning!<br />I may be a fan of the comic, but this film is spectacular, very good extra content. Contains 42 minutes in &#34;deleted scenes&#34;, with all the drama that lives Bruce ... and other content.
B00499NHLC|5.0|From the music to the writing to the acting to the directing, this series has it down to a logical perfection.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I've been using this app for a few years on my Android phone.  Just added it to Kindle Fire.  I use it for party planning, book lists, meeting notes.  I like a recent addition of checkbox items.  I know I am not using the app to its fullest capabilities, but it does what I need excellently.  Have never lost anything, it's incredibly stable compared to other apps I try out.
B004LWZW7O|3.0|I like science fiction movies, and this one is OK to view if nothing else is better on TV.  I have a collection of movies, so I waited until this one was reduced in price.  Nothing else to say about it, but don't spend too much buying it if you collect movies either.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|This movie was okay at best, and looooong.  It drug on forever with really no comedy to keep us interested.  My husband fell asleep!
B00CM6ZLG8|4.0|I have been a fan if Demi since she was on Disney. Her music has matured, but she stays true to her also maturing fan base. (Unlike Miley Cyrus) I give it a four because some of the lyrics are lacking in cleverness, but most are very catchy. My favorite is 'Made in the USA'!
B003Y5HWK4|5.0|It's a great series, good content, 1080p picture quality ... I recommend it. Over the next two seasons the comments have not been the best.
B0069UP2PI|4.0|I hope we humans never have to find out, but the movie CONTAGION is so convincing of what this country--and the world--would look like in the deadly wake of an airborne pathogen epidemic, that it sends shudders down the old backbone.  We see researchers and CDC officials (Jennifer Ehle and Laurence Fishburne) frantically race against time to find a vaccine; a CDC doctor (Kate Winslet) who actually goes out into the field to fight the disease; a sensationalist journalist (Jude Law) who claims the vaccine already exists, but Big Pharma is suppressing this info because it wants to make trillions in profits; an international medical researcher (Marion Cotillard) actually kidnapped in Asia and held hostage so a village can receive the vaccine; and a husband (Matt Damon) who meets the contagion head on when his wife (Gwyneth Paltrow) returns from a business trip (monkey business, it turns out) in Asia, and becomes one of the first victims of the new disease.<br /><br />And along the way, society as we know it goes to Hades in a hand basket.  Time to lock 'n load.<br /><br />This is a gripping, taut, and (again) highly believable depiction of a mega-outbreak of a deadly disease, a disease killing millions.  The cast gives terrific performances, but (*spoiler!*) don't get too comfortable with several of them, for they aren't around long.  One star off because CONTAGION has too many subplots and story lines to keep track of; the film often gets in its own way.  Having said that, CONTAGION is still one grand dramatic thriller.  Finally, here's a little hint:  When in Asia, don't order the pork.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
B00124PXW8|5.0|This is ground zero for the explosion in cinema that is demon possession and related horror.  Williams Friedkin's masterpiece is timeless and holds up quite well with time.  Max Von Sydow and Ellen Burstyn lead a cast of talented actors that portray such horror on screen that was never seen before and has rarely been equaled since.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I really love this application because  can access it in whatever city or state I'm in. It is great for people who travel slot.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It is great to access the episodes quickly and there are never any buffering issues. The image quality is great as well!
B0063IH60K|3.0|Each new hand and commercials appear. None of them are of any value to me. You must tap the screen just right to get rid of them. The game itself is ok. You have to tap each card to send to the ace piles.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I have played The first temple run ,this one has much more in the game which in turn makes it more exciting to play
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This author never disappoints. The way Hosseini knit the individual characters' life stories together was brilliant. Can't wait to read his next book!
B004JOCU2O|5.0|I luv this movie. LOL I cant stop watching it...in fact I'm about to watch it again!! Based on true events. Oh my!
B0051E9INK|4.0|Clancy Brown, some decent fight scenes and effects for the era, an intriguing  premise (as long as you don't read into it too much), and of course, Queen,  all carry this 80s sci-fi standard.  Christopher Lambert is well-cast but poorly written, as are most of the cast.  Not to be missed, however.  if you're a fan of the genre.  Do yourself a favor if you really like it: Skip the movie sequels (not worth the mouse click so much as 2.99) and go right to the Adrian Paul TV series.
B00AG297GK|1.0|Horrible, terrible movie.  Worst movie ever made.  I regret wasting my time watching it.  This guy needs to find another career.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Difficult to follow. Very confusing!.If i could have been able understand the relevance of all the different factions, it may have been more enjoyable.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I wish it were longer than 10 levels. I finished it in a couple of hours. It does keep you guessing, and the level of challenge was just right. More levels to come hopefully sooner then later. I do recommend it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Well written and superbly performed. True quality. I have devoured every episode, and eagerly anticipate seeing how their lives unfold.
B005PK57NU|5.0|The Good Wife has a great cast. Everyone's coming from a different a perspective in life & the writers make each character complex, like real life. It doesn't hurt that I like law shows.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|You must purchase upgrade for alarm feature to work . Downloaded this app especially for the alarm clock. Will delete immediately.
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|Great reboot of this franchise with interesting story lines on how the crew of the Enterprise came to be. Now I can seen the next movie that just came out.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis was excellent. The story was well played and the acting was perfect. This movie will watched for generations to come..
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I'm a bonafide, card-carrying member of the Twilight fan club, and I've read the hardback version of this title several times.  Once I bought my Kindle and because I'm planning a trip to Forks, WA, I wanted to have a digital copy to reference while I'm there.  This was just what I wanted.
B000NQRE9Q|3.0|Being the Blu-ray edition I was expecting crisper visual definition, though color and sound were good.<br /><br />The addition of the bonus disk makes this a good but not great overall collection.
B0058SNKM4|5.0|These shoes have been comfortable since the first time I put them on!  They are very cute with shorts and jeans, plus they are waterproof, so they are great for taking the dog out at night and early morning.  Several people have asked me where I got them.  I like them so much that I will be ordering them again soon in another color!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The Downton Abbey series is wonderful.  Great story line for all characters. Can't wait for the new season to begin!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Couldn't put it down, as with all of Gillian's books. Always amazing plot twists that keep you guessing. Waiting for the next book...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love escape games and this one is a lot of fun.  Hard enough to keep you interested but easy enough to figure out.  Give it a try!
B009LMTDL0|4.0|As a person who has been in the work force for a long time, I have figured quite a bit of this out.  I did, however, think that this is a must read for all three of my young adult children, regardless of gender.  It did feel like she was actively trying to rehabilitate Mark Zuckerbergs  public image a bit too much.
B005HSL626|2.0|Was recommended by a friend. I did not have much interest in the app. The fact that is free made it ok. My grandson will play a few minutes.
B00DF0POXA|2.0|Not sure what he was going through, but this is his worse every.  Worse than 808 project.  I do not like any of the songs, and wish I could have gotten my money back.  Kanye if you want to keep your fan base please come out with a better project.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Archer is one of my favorite authors.  His books are well written and the characters memorable.  I thought this was a trilogy to find out another  question to be answered.  When is the next book due out???
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A friend told us about this program and we have watched all the episodes.  It's superbly done with fantastic acting.  The story line is interesting, the characters are full and diverse.  We can't wait till the fall and the next season begins.  We are immersed with the Crowley family and their servants.
