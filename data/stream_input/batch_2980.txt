B00003JRCQ|4.0|Great sweet movie, have watched it more than once. Nice to see some commonly known actors casted in film. Good for older kids.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|This cd is a true classic I found every song that I wanted to here it was on this three cd recordings.This cd collection was well worth the money.
B00B89LZ4C|5.0|Eventhough it is a statue it still is pretty sweet.  Also comes with hat, money, and blue meth. Spend no more than 20 bucks on this figure or you will get ripped in the ass.
B000M06SU4|5.0|I see I'm the 990th reviewer at this time. Four-and-a-half stars is probably more suitable (save the five stars for Revolver, the White Album and such). When I first heard of this album / concept, I was skeptical. But fortunately my brother bought it and raved about it to me, then my son received it as a birthday present and we've been playing it ever since. Don't let the concept throw you. In the hands of George Martin and his son, they knew exactly what they were doing.<br /><br />Of the many highlights, the final &#34;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&#34; &#62; &#34;Hey Jude&#34; &#62; &#34;Sgt. Pepper reprise&#34; and &#34;All You Need is Love&#34; packs one emotional whallop. It's one of my favorite sequences. If you love the Beatles I honestly don't see how you can go wrong.<br /><br />For those who play vinyl: although not cheap, the sound is truly marvelous, as good as any Beatles vinyl I have owned. Not only is it a huge step up from the CD (which actually sounds terrific, better than many of the &#34;normal&#34; Beatles releases), you will hear things you have never heard before. Warm, inviting, unusually detailed, you will just get emotionally hooked in. Highly recommended.
B0055DNH0C|5.0|I enjoyed this CD and Ive lost it, LOL!  If you like PITBULL I highly recommend this purchase!  As I will be buying it again too.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I truly enjoyed this novel following the life of a character, not endowed by beauty, grace or worldliness.  Her world is encompassed by her family, situations beyond her control and her knowledge of the tiny realms of the garden that inhabit her constant inspiration.  And yet her incredible FREEDOM to explore her pursuits, the meaning of her life and her situation is so compelling and satisfying.  What a wonderful book!  The characters and surroundings are as detailed as one could imagine a tiny herbarium would be.  I find myself thoroughly entranced and enchanted. This small world being the first of its kind in a departure for the author from her other writings -- certainly I hope it to be the first of many to come.  A must read for lovers of historical fiction.
B0013TTLDE|3.0|Don't know why really just yet anyway.  Just not enough depth or history or something..... maybe more plot needed. More character depth.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I really thought I had low enough expectations of romance novels to never be disappointed. I was wrong. They're pretty much always poorly written, predictable, and lacking in character or plot development.<br />This reached new lows. I can only assume the auther has the emotional and relational maturity of a head of lettuce; and the goal seems to be to get young women to yearn to perform some sexual healing on a psychopath that secretly has a heart of gold. I mean seriously, romance novels are always a little demeaning to women but who wants to read about a virgin getting beat with a belt for rolling her eyes.<br />'Plot'' summary: a twenty year old vigin who has never been remotely interested in a man and  can't walk, masturbate, use a computer, eat (too busy chewing her lip), or speak without blushing meets a young billionaire she wants to bone. (Also did I mention shes apparently gorgeous but doesn't think so because her eyes are too big and blue and her hair's too full?)<br />He explains that he wants to beat her and keep her as a sex slave (or any kind of slave he would require). A week passes during which she considers it and they fall in love. She explains that she doesnt like being beaten and this man who claims he made his billions by being an excellent judge of character is completely shocked. He beats her again. She leaves. The end.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love it so much fun and IT IS FREE dealt if I could I would get it again<br />(chirldren love it)
B0042TV4IW|5.0|My family and I love Lark Rise to Candleford! We watch a lot of BBC programming and this is another excellent show!
0670026638|4.0|A New York writer transplanted to an isolated island off the coast of British Columbia.  A Japanese girl raised in Silicon Valley repatriated to Tokyo after the dot-com bubble bursts, then sent to stay with her great-grandmother, a Buddhist nun, for the summer.  Hovering in the background, twin disasters: the collapse of the Twin Towers in 2001 and the great tsunami of 2011.  Threatening in the foreground, suicidal despair. Sounds like almost too much drama to pack into one novel, doesn't it? Ruth Ozeki just manages to pull it off after a slow beginning which almost had me putting the book aside.<br /><br />Full disclosure:  I'm a sucker for books with multiple points of view, italicized phrases in a foreign language explanatory footnotes, and snatches of poetry used to introduce and foreshadow divisions of the book. If these authorial intrusions turn you off, this book is not for you.<br /><br />I'm also fond of books which introduce mystical and mythic elements and make me question reality.  If you like books fully grounded in \\"the real world\\", you will likely get impatient with Ozeki's side excursions into zen meditation and quantum mechanics.<br /><br />If you like books with plot twists that take you in unexpected directions, with characters almost Dickensian in their colorful uniqueness, and descriptions of setting that suck you in so that you are sweating in the summer heat of Japan and shivering in the winter storms of British Columbia, then you will likely enjoy \\"Tale for the Time Being\\".
1250012570|5.0|I have to say I was leery about buying this book, because of two reasons.<br />1. Never heard of the author<br />2. It seemed childish<br /><br />Overall, I truly enjoyed the book.  The content was mature, and set in the perfect time.  I couldn't stop reading about these two.  I loved how it transitioned between speakers.  The characters were so deep. You read through the book and see how the characters changed and started to fall in love. This trasnition was natural and made it seem real.  I you are debating buying this book as well, don't, go ahead and buy it.  If you love, tragic love stories and two beautifully crafted characters, buy it.<br /><br />You have to.. AMAZING
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|Not bad ... especially for the third in this series. I liked it. It's a fun action flick. It does have some minor plot holes, such as how he saves the day at the end... Umm, maybe he could have brought out 'operation house party' or whatever a bit earlier and not have had to cobble together suit parts at the hardware store. And, yea, I get that doing this would have let everyone know he wasn't dead.
1416594795|5.0|&#34;Truth in Facts&#34;<br /><br />very interesting, Makes things clear and in an enjoyable.It is a book that takes the all doubt surrounding the facts of evolution
B00F91G5BS|3.0|The story happens real fast, and totally implausibly - skipping from here to there, and everywhere Brad goes, crap follows. Lots of 'holes' in the plot if you ask me. And Brad's acting was terrible. As someone else said, it's as if he took too many Xanax and is benzo'd out the entire movie. He never gets that upset or excited, about anything.... oh, zombies are about to eat your kids, no reason to exclaim, just another day in the neighborhood
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|so yea they should do that. thhhhhhaaaaat would be fun also you should make you keep swiping the screen down to make the space helmet will stay on
B00F99EMRE|5.0|When this album came out I swear that my ears would bleed after trying to listen to this album. I remember back then there was a RUSH forum where a member renamed this album (as a semi-joke), &#34;Vapid Rancid&#34; and laughed because it was true. Fast forward ELEVEN years later to the present day...<br /><br />I knew after three seconds of listening to &#34;One Little Victory&#34; that this was the way that the album was meant to be heard. Every element of Peart's drumming was clearly audible--and I don't mean high-hats, snare or bass drums...I mean technique. Yes, the remix is THAT good. The vocals are very clear, the bass is distinct and guitars are spacious. The best way to describe the new mix is that every part is now distinct which highlights how brilliant RUSH is when they write their separate parts to create a greater whole.<br /><br />It's my understanding that some parts were added like some solos and stuff. I'm in my mid-forties now so while I did notice some really cool differences/additions, I'm sure that I missed most of them.  I'm not in high school where I could spend a week's worth of evenings taking their music apart audibly.<br /><br />Get this album and relish your past in a whole new light.
B00CPLGFM4|5.0|Plug and Play, easy to install, fast reliable AMD you can't go wrong.<br />I have a 1 gig fast graphics card [GPU] so I wanted to test the GPU in the CPU [the processor]. I logged into World of War Craft [a very graphics demanding game] without the graphics cards and noted the automatic settings for the game. I then shut down the PC, installed the card I have and went back into the game, nothing changed, same exact auto settings and same visual look of the game. If you want to play online games and don't have the jing for a card you don't need one with this CPU, now isn't that a super good deal? You bet it is.<br />Without AMD, Intel has the world by the,,, um,, ya those things, so give it some thought, save some cash, get a great CPU/GPU and help keep Intel from ruling the world, it is in your hands.
B002ODRPUE|3.0|a bit slow and this is first time I have seen it. It may felt differently if I saw it when it came out. But it just feel slightly old movie. It has good style and still interesting movie.
0345803485|5.0|Great
030746363X|4.0|I've lost around 50 pounds in eight months. I am a bit stalled now but not gaining. I need to up my exercise. However others who have tried the slow carb diet can't stand it. I eat a regular breakfast, broil some meat for lunch and use leftovers of the meat with spinach and red beans at night. I get bored at times and succumb to A1 sauce and marinades. But it suits me. But I'm crazier than Ferriss since I can't do the math. I can do this thing for a good while longer. Another fifty pounds.
0345803493|5.0|Great
B0042TV4IW|4.0|BBC again delivers a visually stunning period piece that draws you in to the lives of average people.  Beautifully filmed with excellent scenery and costumes.  You will come to know the residents as they interact in the course of everyday events in rural England.  Think &#34;All Creatures Great and Small&#34; without the animals.  You'll end up watching all four seasons.
B008602KQI|5.0|The Hunger Games series are fantastic for youth and young adults (better than the movie in my opinion...but isn't that usually the way it is?). I have read the books again and again, and have given them as gifts. In my experience, many are captivated during the first read-through and have a hard time putting it down! It's one of those &#34;just one more page&#34; at three in the morning kind of books...
B002KSPKRS|1.0|These headsets are nothing but static and crackling while you where them.  This was the first and the last Turtle Beach headset I will be buying.  I wish that I had listened to the reviews, because now I'm stuck with these things and in the middle of a cut scene when you're trying to hear what the hell is going on they will start cutting out and crackling, and heaven forbid someone else in the room turns on WIFI on a computer or something.  Maybe it's just that they're wireless, but even so Turtle Beach lost me as a customer because they don't have enough pride in they're work to let crap like this out!
B00B23O96A|3.0|Nice set of laid back tunes from a guy who's been making this type of record for the last 40 years. Sure older fans wish he would play and sing like the guy who made Crossroads and Layla but that ain't happening. Clapton is completely disconnected  from  his rock guitar god days and has no interest in reliving those days. That's the problem with being rich enough and popular enough to record whatever you want. What the fans want doesn't really matter.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is one of those heart felt, character driven stories. It seemed as if I knew where the story would lead right from the beginning, but about half way through it took me in it's arms and I couldn't let go. I know...it's a book! I just loved it, and highly recommend.
B00B9366VO|5.0|I was surprised at how many of my favorite musicians were in this doc. Dave Grohl had a great idea.
B00B89LZ4C|3.0|I had seen this figure around the web and read other reviews, so I knew what to expect. I know the figure has 0 articulation, which is fine since he's just going to be standing on a shelf, and I read that the card backing is often separated from the plastic front, which it was. I'm fine with that as well since I planned to open it. The sculpt is very nice overall, and the paint job seems done well with one huge problem. I removed the sunglasses and had to stifle a laugh. His eyes are pointing severely in opposite directions. I'm not talking slightly, as is common with some action figures, but majorly - about as far toward the outside of the face on each side as a pupil can go. Full on Derp face. That was hugely disappointing to me, but fortunately, he does have the Heisenberg sunglasses to cover up those crazy eyes.
B007ZXK08C|1.0|My first book by this author. I didn't take to the story at all. I didn't like the chosen background. I could not recommend this book as a worthwhile read to anyone. I could not wait to delete it from my Kindle.<br /><br />There were some commendable qualities in the characters - the understandable anxiety of parents for the ill health of a child, the loyalty and trust of an old friend.<br /><br />The topic itself was a turn off for me. Such interference with nature seemed gross.I would not like to read another Gillian Flynn book.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|I enjoyed the book but found it didnt flow that well at the beginning. I wasn't as moved by it as I was with the Kite Runner or A Thousand Splendid Suns.
B005R32L66|5.0|I like the video calling from my tablet also free calls to other Skype family and friends. I have not had a dropped call either voice or video. Check out the phone cards; very inexpensive. More inexpensive if you at a free wi fi hotspot and want to make a Skype to either a land line or smartphone (check the rates especially the unlimited card).
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Delightfully written you really made a connection with Don and had empathy towards his social dilemmas.  It was written so that you had an understanding of his personality and were entertained with the humour of the situations he found himself in.
B0058OUJA4|4.0|Complicated and quick  combatants to  put your defense to the test.. It will challenge you to your limits even in easy mode.
1451696191|5.0|This book is amazing! Really opens your eyes to what teens really go through. I recommend it to all teens like me! Others can agree!
B00D555BBU|4.0|My new tablet did not have an app for regular e=mail. I down loaded this and it is very good so far. I have set up two of my three main e-mail accounts with this app and no problem syncing both those accounts to the tablet.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|I didn't get to hear it, but she knows all the words.  So does her little brother, and he wishes he didn't.
1419707671|5.0|Perfect books! Quick reads for my 8 yr old daughter. She is now going through them for the second time!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I couldn't help but sympathize with all the parents identified in this book. The justice system is a powerful and imperfect machine.Sometimes, defending one means sacrificing another. Great book! I really enjoyed it's multiple levels of intrigue.
140006922X|4.0|This is a great look at the real background and way of life during the times of Jesus.  Aslan has given real pause to the thinking that Jesus we proclaim, walked calmly from place to places spreading kindness and peace and gentleness.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|To try to summarize this book would be to do it a disservice.  Read it.  Zusak achieves a truly original voice in that of Death, the narrator.  As I read it, I kept asking myself a question that Death, himself, ultimately asks in the later chapters: how can a thing be so beautiful and so ugly at the same time?  The beauty of the language and the ugliness of the topic of Nazi Germany sit side by side in a puzzling, yet deeply satisfying dissonance throughout the book.<br /><br />A girl.  A boy.  A man. A woman.  War.  Life.  Words. Their power. How people live.  And how they die.  Read it.  Every page will offer at least one sentence that stops the breath in your lungs with the beauty of its unexpectedness.  Zusak' s unconventional use of the language creates a book of startling power and impact.
0312430000|3.0|Quick easy read with some good ideas. If you've read the New Yorker article, you've already got the gist. Borrow the book from a friend or the library, and then you'll only be out the couple hours you'll need to fly through it. I can't see myself pulling off the bookshelf to look something up, so it seems a waste to have bought it.
B000P0J09W|3.0|I have always loved this movie. My son lived in Astoria, and he can pick up the landmarks in this movie.  Dumb movie, but I do recommend it.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|This is a great way to display an epic film, I've enjoyed these very much! Star wars rocks oh yeah
B001DHXT6G|5.0|2nd best series ever.  Discs work fine. I have always been a Trekkie.  If you like Star Trek, then when this comes on sale, buy it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I liked the way she wove everyone's lives together.  She developed each character as the story evolved.  It was a very interesting read!
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a great game. I find it difficult to stop playing once I get started. I keep wanting to play 'just one more.' I do agree with other players though that the color and delete buttons need to be farther apart. I have hit the wrong one accidentally more than once. But overall, terrific game.
B001C3I4UM|5.0|The older this gets, the mellower it becomes.<br />The tracks are clear, and well preserved.<br />This music opens up the spirit, and satisfies the soul.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|It's practical, minimal and stylish. It's a clean looking classic design and I actually use it. Worth the money and takes up so little memory.
B008MM9630|5.0|Good game think the animals should move around more though. I recommend this game to younger kids.. it is fun to play. I like it myself.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Why everyone was so caught up in this book! Though initially I was prepared not to like it, I actually did. The characters are complex and I especially liked the verbal bandying between Ana and Christian. Their emails were awesome!<br /><br />Bring on the sequel!
B0042X9L6A|4.0|It's a nice flash, I gave it 4 stars because of a problem I have:<br />From the first time I paid attention to AF Illuminators - one of the them doesn't light at all. I was very disappointed. The other lamp is so poor that I think it's not  just because of being single lamp. it's light projects in the shape of horizontal lines, so I have to use the camera af assist (I really hoped that flash would be helpful while focusing in low light, (better than my camera could do) otherwise, there is no point of having this feature :X)... I hope I can fix it somehow :(((
B008DVJMAW|5.0|LOVE this band - if you like blues, country rock, southern rock, you will absolutely LOVE this DVD live album!
B00000IQW5|5.0|Such a touching and FUNNY movie!  There is some good action too.  Made me nervous a few times.  Quality film that is also wholesome (it would be a G rating these days).
B009SH5JS4|5.0|I love this movie!!  It's a typical chick flick!  And it only took a couple of days to get to me!  Quick turn around!  Awesome!!!
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I'm getting sick of this game, but mostly because I've been addicted to it for the past month.  Don't seem to be able to put it down...
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I am having so much fun having all my books with me on my tablet. . . so great! I recommend this app.
B000NY12LO|5.0|I definitely didn't see several of the  things in this book coming. It kept me guessing the entire time  .
B003EVWDR0|5.0|This is an OUTSTANDING film! I have heard people saying &#34;Oh, I don't like alien movies.&#34; No, this is no classic alien movie. In fact the movie not only has a hidden message behind the story and its amazingly beautiful scenery (Director James Cameron spent 10 YEARS creating this film), but this movie also shows how &#34;alien&#34; we could be as humans. When you watch this film, consider how &#34;down to Earth&#34; these Na'bi really are; as well as how Blissfully happy they are in the absence of the human presence.<br />;-)
1416914293|5.0|Amazing series to own! Wanted all my TMI books in hardcover. This was the way to go! Fast shipping!  Really happy!
B000I9YX06|5.0|What I like about this movie is that there is a HIDDEN MEANING behind everything. It is a great thriller as well;-)
B00ANAC32U|3.0|Durable and fits better than third party bumpers I've tried. However, the opening for the headphone jack is on the small side and will interfere with wider connectors.
B008PZZV8S|3.0|Plot was good, but a lot of detail was left out making you guess at the motivation for a lot of actions.  Research the internet, IMDB or read the book and that will fill a lot of holes for you.  It will also help with the odd ending.
B002KGEORM|5.0|There series is a touch of reality for a community we don't get to see in much of our lives. Some people have lived it and seen it. The writing is thoughtful in an alarming way. Great series.
B009ZQFSRA|4.0|Pretty fantastic visual effects.  I understand why it is compared to the matrix.  The plot is not very original, the down trodden suppressed by the government.  The oppressed rise up to challenge the government.  There are a couple of twists towards the end that kept it interesting.
B009XPFS5A|5.0|Clearly the Kurt Sutter has incredible insight on character development. Bad boys and family. All quite powerful and sad and heartbreaking.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I have been an Abraham-Hicks fan for quite awhile, and this book fits right in with that, only in a scientific way. The author is funny! I've laughed out loud a few times! And, I&#34;m about 1/2 way through the experiments and really enjoying them.<br />What do you have to lose? Give it a try. It's a great, empowering read. Glad I found it!
1442359919|3.0|Devin Jones is a pretty typical college student.  He's an average student who is getting his education on a patchwork of loans, grants, and work study programs.  Devin was 21 years old in the summer of 1973, and Joyland is the story of one of the most important years of Devin's life.<br /><br />Instead of returning home that summer, Devin decided to take a job at a local amusement park called Joyland.  He spends the summer learning all things carny, how to walk the walk and talk the talk as they say in the business.  And of course he learns about the Joyland ghost, said to be a young woman who was murdered on the spook house ride, and whose restless spirit now haunts it.  It's a big summer for Devin as he recovers from being cast off by his first true love and eventually finds himself able to love again.  Along the way he will have his fortune told, save two lives, fly a kite, and face a cold-blooded killer high atop the Carolina Spin.  I think Devin will turn out to be a good man, if he survives this summer that is.<br /><br />I'm a pretty big fan of Stephen King but I have to admit that Joyland didn't really do it for me.  To me, one of King's strong points has always been his ability to make me care about his characters, but that wasn't really the case in this book.  I found myself not caring much what happened to Devin, Annie, and the little boy whose name I now forget.  The ghost in the spook house was kind of cool, but in the end played very little part in the story.  I'll admit that I was surprised when King finally revealed who the killer was, but again I found myself not caring that much.  I won't go so far as to say the novel was boring.  King's writing is as engaging as ever, but I just felt that he didn't spend as much time on the details.<br /><br />Michael Kelly was a good narrator for Joyland.  He just sounded right for the part and was a good voice for Devin Jones.  Kelly is an American actor with a long list of film and television credits including the TV shows The Sopranos, Fringe, Criminal Minds, and Person of Interest.  His film credits include this year's upcoming films Now You See Me and Man of Steel.the TV shows The Sopranos, Fringe, Criminal Minds, and Person of Interest.

B00AFROVQC|5.0|I read all the reviews before reading this book, and decided because the Kindle price was free, what was I going to miss out on?? So I took a chance, while there may be a few grammatical errors, it does not take away from the story line. To be honest, I was so consumed by the book I did not even notice the mistakes until I thought about it. The story line is fluid and is fantastic. I am so happy I listened to my gut feeling on this book! I love it, just bought the 2nd book today! Cannot wait to continue this great story
B00BGI086Q|2.0|So I have watched 3 episodes and enjoyed the show, for the most part. Silliness abounds in typical super hero fashion with the bad guys being slaughtered by-arrows? Seriously? And they never pick their guns up again-just lie there. Well, it is from a comic series-so we live with that. I don't like the actors very much. All the girls are gorgeous, way too pretty for reality. American TV does this. Reading other reviews, I see the series degrades into soap opera melodrama. Too bad. It all comes down to the writing. Acting is important too, yet I can forgive the acting if the story is compelling enough. Other series I wished had continued are New Amsterdam and Dresden. Now we have silly shows like Sleepy Hollow-4 horsemen of the apocalypse? Back to the point; time is precious-pick your shows wisely.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The Chromecast works just as advertised - finds the wireless network and sets itself up just great. The included apps work well but I took a star off simply because there are so few choices of content. The ability to cast from a Chrome tab on a Windows PC is perhaps the most remarkable thing but it isn't available yet from Chrome on my Asus tablet. When the apps finally appear it will be hard to beat!
0316236535|4.0|I really like this story to touch on body parts.  The graphics are cute and simple and the book can inspire crafts.
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|Very interesting fantasy novel. Left me feeling I would like to know more about the old family. They could be the basis of another novel.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Deborah Harkness' passion for history is reflected in this series, her writing style and attention to detail make this a fun read.
B000YKE87W|5.0|Jonas handles all these arias expertly.  He also does them perfectly in French, Italian, and of course his native Deutsch!  I have not heard any yet in other languages but have not doubt that he can master them, also.  I will add more of his CD's to my collection in the near future.  Wish he would come perform in Seattle...
B00881VLCE|2.0|downloaded it to my phone went to play it and it wont let me play it so I deleted it
B00AEQYM6S|5.0|I only recently discovered Jonas Kaufmann.  He is a marvelous, and well-polished tenor.  He handles difficult Wagner music perfectly. I will add more Kaufmann C D's to my collection soon!
B00867HDTA|4.0|this game is fun but only for an hour or two at a time. i would still recommend it if your looking for a short time.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is awesome just like the game love it you should really get the game you won't regret it
B00AB7HESI|5.0|i love this game and its great for the kids. not like the other scrbblenauts because this game does not have a free play ability but there are enough levels that you won't remember it
B000FC0ZEO|5.0|This book is the culmination of, not just The Tawny Man trilogy, but of all the trilogies set in this wonderful world that Robin Hobb has created. The depth of character & emotion, not to mention her masterful story-telling, takes you on adventures that are as unique as they are magical. By the time you read to the end, you dread it's coming because these characters have become like family and you want their stories to go on & on. Start with the Farseer trilogy, Assassin's Apprentice, and read right through. But don't forget the Liveship trilogy and the Rain Wilde trilogy, ending with Tawny Man trilogy. After this book is where Dragon Haven picks up, I believe. The stories are all separate but intertwined in their history. These are essential fantasy fiction collections, a must in any fiction-lover's library.

034580709X|5.0|I myself am a huge fan of classic Noir and hard-boiled: Richard Stark, James Cain, Raymond Chandler, etc. And I must say that this book was right up there. I honestly avoid longer books, but when i was closing in on the end of this novel i silently hoped that i could put it down and pick it back up and find 100 new pages miraculously added on. The day I finished this, I went and purchased the next book. Great Book!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I just finished chapter two and so far I LOVE this game! Music is awesome and the Ho scenes are more challenging than any  I've seen in almost any other game! They are totally doable but definitely require you to LOOK! I haven't had any glitches on my Kindle fire HD as of yet and as long as the game isn't already half over I will update to 5 stars!!  Thank God for the hint button and directional arrows!! I've played quite a few of this type of game but definitely DO NOT consider myself a master, or overly smart, but I'm no newbie and this game needs a few hints!! Awesome!!

B007N6ZH5M|5.0|I simply loved this book & its balanced approach. I agree with the author that the Goldman Sachs's forecast 35 years down the line was a con job. I agree with the author, it will be a third coming for USA and it will once again lead the next economic recovery. The author said it all about India in one caption &#34;The Great Indian Hope Trick&#34;! The book gave me an insight in to the functioning of countries like Brazil, Mexico & Russia & made me feel my government was not that bad after all. The book helped me in holding South Korea in awe.<br />When Ruchir wrote “Almost every emerging market currency has strengthened against the dollar over the last decade but nothing to beat the Brazilian ‘Real’ (currency) that has doubled in value against dollar. When a country is pricing itself this far out of the competition, you can feel it on the ground. Restaurants in Sao Paulo are pricier than those in Paris. Hotel rooms cost more in Rio than on the French Riviera. Apartments in Rio out-price those in New York.”, I realized currency devaluation wasn’t the only problem. Even an unusual appreciation in your currency can make one’s country unattractive.<br />“Every nation has its big tycoons. But, to a rare degree Mexico is owned by them. The top ten business families control almost every industry, from telephones to media, which allows them to extract high prices without much effort & to enjoy unusually high profit margins. Not that the Mexican magnates are exactly comfortable. They ride around in bulletproof cars, surrounded by bodyguards, while trying hard to make themselves inconspicuous. By contrast, I have travelled in to the badlands of Uttar Pradesh with one of India’s top billionaires, who went unprotected & felt perfectly safe.” Wow!<br />All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable book.
B00C5R8364|1.0|I read 20% of this dog before giving up in disgust. This book, even though it has the great writer's name, was not written by him ... or, if it were, it's a sad day for his fans. It reads like a dull sketch of a character and his mission rather than a NOVEL detailing these. Don't waste your time--or, more importantly, your money--on this loser.

B00E9P959O|5.0|\\"Vapor Trails\\" has always been a turd in the punchbowl for RUSH. An over-modulated, over-compressed sea of noise. It's an album I've always ranked as the worst in the band's vast and varried discography.  Not any more. \\"Vapor Trails Remixed\\" is amazing! On the first listening, I'm experiencing instrumentation never heard before.  You'll have a hard time believing that this is just a remix. In places it almost seems like a re-recording.

B00B5JBZGS|5.0|Truthfully I have never actually taken the time to write a review on any album but disarm the descent is beyond worth it. Despite the changing of members throughout killswitches musical career they have pulled every album off beautifully, which lets be honest not a lot of bands in ghis genre can pull that off. For me, this album has topped them all. At first, I thought damn they went really melodic. Seemed as if killswitch was going for a more poppy sound with catchy choruses like the one on \\"due time.\\" but the more I listened the more I found myself playing them over and over again in my head...hence I have found a new favorite and will listen to this one for years to come.<br />P.S.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The quality, the beauty of the filming - in every way -, the acting, the story and the accuracy of portraying times past, makes it a most pleasurable (and favorite) show to watch.<br />Matthew's death did, however, leave us with great sadness!
B000AM6OQ2|5.0|John Carpenter's The Fog is now one of my all-time favorite horror films.  This movie is one of if not my favorite John Carpenter films.  John Carpenter is now one of my favorite directors who has made many amazing films, but this one may be my favorite.  I will even say I like this film more than Halloween and The Thing.  I love those films as well, but this film entertained me a bit more.  The Fog has everything going for it.  It has great characters, decent effects, great location, an interesting legend, and great atmosphere.<br /><br />The film takes place in the fictional town of Antonio Bay, California in the year 1980.  100 years ago a crew of leopards sailed to Antonio By hoping to form a colony there.  However, six conspirators tricked them into crashing their ship against the rocks with a lite fire.  All the leopards died in the crash and the conspirators stole the gold they had with them.  Now, through a supernatural fog the leopards return from the dead to exact revenge.<br /><br />The film has an amazing cast of people like: Adrienne Barbeau, Tom Atkins, Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh, etc.  They all do a great job acting wise.  The film has an amazing atmosphere that you rarely see anymore.  The legend in this film is quite interesting and makes for a great ghost story.  The effects are great as well especially for the time.  They made the right move by not actually showing the ghosts.  The ghost in the movie are merely silhouettes hidden by the fog.  You never actually the see the ghosts fully and in works.  If they actually showed the ghosts it would have been stupid and a bit less scary, like in the remake where it is stupid CGI.<br /><br />Overall, The Fog is a terrific ghost story that you should definitely see, especially around Halloween.  This is the perfect film to watch with your family or girlfriend/boyfriend around Halloween and have a good time.
1250030951|5.0|Two-second recap: After releasing her YA debut Eleanor and Park last year to critical acclaim, Rainbow Rowell follows up with Fangirl: a funny, thoughtful and insightful coming-of-age novel about a girl venturing out and finding herself at college for the first time.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Full review:<br /><br />Confession: I started hearing a lot about Rainbow Rowell last year, when Eleanor and Park came out.<br /><br />I ending up picking up the book because of the hype, read it and... didn't get it. I didn't dislike the book, but it also wasn't really my cup of tea.<br /><br />So when it came time to read Fangirl, I was cautiously optimistic. I was intrigued by the description of a protagonist who has essentially spent her entire life living in the fantasy world of someone else's creation and was breaking into her own at college for the first time, but I was also worried I wouldn't like the book. I wanted to join the legion of Rainbow fans, and wasn't sure if this would be the book that would do the trick.<br /><br />Fortunately for me, Fangirl was everything I hoped it would be, and more. It's charming, sweet and funny coming-of-age, and I'm confident that Rowell fans will absolutely love and cherish this book.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Things that worked:<br /><br />* Characterizations<br /><br />Sometimes, when you read a book, you'll think, \\"Hey, I want to be friends with this character.\\"<br /><br />But there are also times when you'll read a book, and you'll see so much of yourself in the main character, you'll end up both delighted at the camaraderie, and also feeling kind of taken aback at how someone else in the world could understand you so well, and put that understanding into writing.<br /><br />Such was the case with Cath. She's sweet and gifted, but doesn't realize necessarily how talented or pretty she truly is.<br /><br />Because of past family issues, she's also extremely introverted, and more inclined to spend time alone in her room, unabashedly working on her Simon Snow fanfiction, rather than taking advantage of the fact that she's a freshman in college, and should be out meeting people, and having all sorts of new experiencers.<br /><br />Even if readers aren't necessarily involved in online fandoms in the way Cath is, they will absolutely relate to her that reluctance to step outside of her comfort zone, especially when off at college for the first time. They will cheer her on when she takes small steps - e.g. beginning to eat every meal in the cafeteria - and starts getting out.<br /><br />Cath is the everywoman, with traits, charms and insecurities that I, and I believe that everyone else will relate to.<br /><br />As for the secondary characters, they were a delightful mixture in themselves. Regan was a perfect sidekick to Cath, begrudgingly (and kindly) guiding her through the complexities of freshman year. Levi was charming and sweet, and also had imperfections - which Cath herself noticed - that made him even more special and true to live.<br /><br />Wren, Courtney and the other characters all rounded out Cath's college experience in a way that made me feel seriously nostalgic for my own college days, and I believe other readers will fall in love with them as well.<br /><br />* Writing<br /><br />I already knew that Rowell was a gifted writer after reading Eleanor and Park, and her charms shine even brighter in Fangirl.<br /><br />Everything about her writing was superb. From her descriptions of campus life - the squirrels! - to Cath's internal realization that college actually is kind of difficult, is beautifully realized.<br /><br />Between Rowell's excellent dialogue, her brilliant pacing and plotting of college life, including the types of events and bombshells that we all know ruled our own college lives, readers will be completely immersed in her world.<br /><br />* The relationship between Cath and Wren<br /><br />Fangirl is very much Cath's story. However, this doesn't mean that Rowelldoesn't make it a point to delve into the sibling relationship between the Cath and Wren, with the type of brutal honesty that anyone with a sibling would understand.<br /><br />Rowell does a brilliant job of showing just how someone like Cath would go into college, wanting everything to remain the same between her sister and herself. Wren is her security blanket and in many ways, a template for all of the more brave, impulsive actions that Cath herself isn't willing to commit.<br /><br />Though Wren and Cath are on the outs for much of the novel, Rowell's characterization of the relationship between the two girls is so strong; the reader ends up absolutely understanding how Cath can:<br /><br />A) Forgive Wren for a lot of the things that she does, and<br />B) Actually end up being thankful to Wren for forcing her to leave her comfort zone.<br /><br />As for Wren, Rowell subtly and beautifully shows how someone like Wren, despite her rebellion and desire for change, eventually learns that family ties will always ben the strongest.<br /><br />I think that any reader who has ever had a love/hate relationship with a sibling, will absolutely love reading about Wren and Cath's relationship.<br /><br />* Rowell's depiction and inclusion of online fandoms:<br /><br />At the heard of Fangirl is the depiction of the culture of online fandoms, and Rowell depicts that world beautifully.<br /><br />She does a fantastic job of showing that even though online fandoms are often thought of as being so-called weird people on the internet - a point that Levi and Regan make, several times - it's actually a strong, supportive community where people can be creative and imaginative with pre-formed worlds.<br /><br />Yes, the work of fandom will never have quite the same impact that traditional work does - a point that Cath's writing professor makes in a roundabout way - but it's still important, nonetheless.<br /><br />Rowell also does a beautifully understated job of showing just howand why people turn to fandom, especially in times of personal tragedy. In Cath and Wren's case, they turned to the world of Simon Snow after a family situation, and it's easy, through Rowell's writing, to see why Cath continues to immerse herself in that world.<br /><br />* The romantic relationship<br /><br />The relationship between Levi and Cath was developed slowly and gradually, in a way that I haven't seen in a YA/NA novel in a long, long time. They take the time to get to know each other. They're friends first, and then they begin to realize that they're actually interested in one another.<br /><br />But best of all? They don't see each other as being perfect. Even after they get together, they teasingly note each other's faults in a way, which I think shows that they're realistic, smart and can possibly be in it for the long haul.<br /><br />* The ending<br /><br />Without giving any spoilers away, I thought the ending was perfect. It wrapped up all of the loose ends, but it also left enough questions, so that readers will have the satisfaction of imagining Cath and Wren continuing<br /><br />***<br /><br />Things that didn't work/Things to consider:<br /><br />Nothing. I loved this novel, and I genuinely found it to be flawless.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Final verdict:<br /><br />After reading Fangirl, I fully and completely understand the love for Rainbow Rowell. This is a beautiful, charming coming-of-age novel with a lot of depth and a lot of heart.<br /><br />But more importantly this is novel that really seeks to understand people who aren't perfect, who aren't necessarily popular - in the traditional way, at least - but are also very talented and gifted in their own quiet, understated ways. It's not a surprise that almost every review for Fangirl on Goodreads talks about how the reader felt a kinship with Cath, and I think that as the book goes into wide release, more and more readers will feel the same.<br /><br />I highly, highly recommend this book for all readers, but especially for fans of contemporary fiction, who are looking for something that goes beyond the type of fiction that they normally read.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received a copy of Fangirl from St. Martin's Press, in exchange for an honest review. Thank you!
140006922X|3.0|I'll say this up front: New Testament Studies is a hard discipline.  Its difficulty comes from the wide range of academic departments involved in doing it well.  To dig in for real, one must have some facility with ancient languages (preferably Aramaic as well as Koine Greek and Biblical Hebrew); a grasp of Roman, Seleucid, Ptolemaic, and Parthian histories; working familiarity with the rites and sacred texts of half a dozen worship-traditions, most of which are no longer extant; the ability to spot references to the Hebrew Bible at all turns; and a host of other skill-sets that most folks, myself included, simply do not have the drive to master.  Beyond that, she must have the sort of philosophical mind that can situate a two-thousand-year tradition of Scriptural exegesis and theological commentary in some kind of relationship to what's going on in the text and in the reconstructed historical contexts around all the steps along the way, and doing all of those things in a way that's adequate to the ways that literary traditions work is just as difficult.  In sum, the skillful New Testament interpreter is a true master of the liberal arts and a specialist, holding very particular bodies of learning in tension with the philosophical and rhetorical moves that the practice of synthesizing that learning requires.  That's why I always look upon my teachers and colleagues who do New Testament studies with some deference and great respect.<br /><br />I note all of that because Reza Aslan does some of those things very well.  Sometimes Zealot reveals a fairly strong grasp on the network of overlapping human phenomena that make New Testament Studies so difficult, and sometimes the book seems either unaware of or willfully ignorant of large and important arguments, bodies of knowledge, and traditions of inquiry.  The essay that I'm going to attempt here is no complaint that the book isn't more than it is; it's more a call to Christian teachers to look at the assumptions that the book makes (under the cover ID of the historian who does not make assumptions) and to think hard about the ways that we teach the life of Jesus among the faithful.<br /><br />Roman-Occupied Palestine<br /><br />Aslan's book does an exemplary job of situating Jesus in a very particular historical moment, namely the region of Palestine, mostly in Judea but in the end Jerusalem, occupied by the Roman Empire and internally divided among mystics, militants, corroborators with the occupiers, and the masses of the poor who most acutely suffer from all of the above regimes.  He's absolutely right to insist that, in every case, whether one examines the words or the deeds of Jesus, his followers or his enemies, the first task must be to situate them in that first-century, Roman-occupied-Palestine context, because their words and acts make the most sense as extensions of, reactions to, and other engagements with the historical forces that shaped that moment.  Such is the practice of the best kinds of New-Testament-era history, and so Aslan proceeds.  He leads off the book proper noting Pompey Magnus's conquest of Jerusalem, the presence of the Roman garrison on the Temple Mount, and other salient facts that give shape to the final days of Jesus in Jerusalem (10).  Moreover he explains well the succession of foreign occupiers, from Babylon through to the Romans, interrupted only by a century of Hasmonean monarchy, a state of affairs sometimes indistinguishable from Greek hegemony (12).  When Jesus shows up, the political scene is a complex one, and all of the sayings and acts of Jesus make more sense when one has a grasp of some of the overlapping political realities.<br /><br />Of particular interest for a relatively new student of the New Testament is Aslan's skillful treatment of the word \\"messiah.\\"  Noting its roots in the Hebrew verb for \\"to anoint,\\" Aslan traces nicely the progression of the term from cultic and royal contexts in the monarchical period of Israel through the Cyrus oracle of Isaiah 45, which says as clearly as one could imagine that Cyrus the Great of the Persians is YHWH's messiah.  He notes that the most common expectation for the Messiah in first-century Palestine was for a new Mosaic liberator and Davidic king, though certainly the Dead Sea Scrolls indicate expectations for two Messiahs, one a kingly figure and one a new and honest high priest for Jerusalem (19).  Zealot also notes the connotations of several New Testament terms before Jesus comes along: \\"King of the Jews,\\" before it's written on the titulus above Jesus's cross, is the title given to Herod the Great in the wake of Marc Antony's re-conquest of Palestine (20).  And for good measure, Aslan notes that \\"son of God\\" has both Davidic roots (in texts like Psalm 2) and Roman roots because Caesar was often announced as \\"son of God\\" (23).  In other words, this part of New Testament Studies is quite well done in Zealot, and Aslan's prose style is accessible and interesting.<br /><br /> The Illiterate Diaspora<br /><br />Reza Aslan's historiography is fairly straightforward, even if it begins with some reductionism: whatever Jesus was, one should not posit that he strayed outside the possibilities offered by Second-Temple Judaism.  The Jews of the Roman period expected a new king, so one should not expect that Jesus could have imagined himself as a \\"divine messiah\\" (32).  Jewish nationalism of a violent flavor was rampant in Galilee, so the god who orders genocide in Joshua and inspires Psalms about shattering enemies' heads and children's heads-\\"that is the only God that Jewus knew and the sole God he worshiped\\" (122).  Within the confines of this historiography, Jesus could not be other than a Galilean revolutionary, not much different from Theudas or Bar Kochba or any of the other half-dozen would-be messiahs of the early Roman Empire.  Wherever the idea that Jesus loved all nations comes from, it's not from the historical person named Jesus of Nazareth.<br /><br />Where, then, did the nonviolent image of Jesus that we see in the gospels come from, then?  Since Jesus himself was incapable of imagining things beyond the bounds of Galilean nationalism, it must have come from somewhere else, and in Aslan's account, that somewhere has to do with diaspora Jewry.  According to Reza Aslan, the only Jews in the first century who really knew their Bibles were those in Jerusalem.  Jesus and his fellow Galileans were more than likely illiterate (34), and Jews from outside of Jerusalem never had an opportunity to hear the Bible read out loud (166-one wonders what they were doing in their Synagogues, but that's for another conversation).  If they had, they would clearly know what Reza Aslan no doubt picked up in his undergraduate religion classes, namely that the Torah and Psalms and Prophets do not really make reference to a Messiah in the way that Christians would come to understand the word, so their reading, which seems to alienate the Temple authorities before and after the crucifixion, must result from a lack of familiarity with the text, according to Reza Aslan.<br /><br />Here is where Zealot reveals just how difficult New Testament Studies can be.  After all, Aslan has the Roman history down.  He knows about the diversity of Judaic sects.  He's got the modern-hermeneutics background to know that eisegesis ultimately runs risks of distortion.  One of the only places where I disagree with his reading is in the area of the history of Biblical interpretation, and yet one difference out of four makes all the difference.  Let me attempt to articulate how I differ.<br /><br />In the centuries immediately surrounding the life of Jesus, as an examination of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Rabbinic Midrash, the Mishnah, and other Jewish documents will reveal, hermeneutics was not the exact science that Aslan can't find among the diaspora Jews and the Galilean revolutionaries.  The ways that people read things were not first and foremost to find a \\"literal\\" sense to stand alone (although that was also important, as a figure as late as Augustine will demonstrate) but to hear the text as a divine voice, something that can speak on a plurality of registers.  So the moves that we moderns call allegorical, anagogical, typological, and visionary readings were not decorative frames that supplemented an otherwise self-contained sacred text; they were  the modes by which one arrived at the sacred, with the text being the prime instrument.  In other words, although Aslan nails most of the political and military history, he renders Bible-reading an ahistorical practice, one that people get \\"right\\" or \\"wrong\\" but which knows no real historical contingency.<br /><br />Adding the contingency and temporal particularity of Bible-reading to the historical mix, the transformation of Galilean nationalism into something like second-century Christianity does not require a mass delusion, a gigantic textual mix-up, or any such conspiracy.  It only requires a human being something like the Jesus that one encounters in the synoptic gospels, someone whose interpretive moves, among other history-shaping moments, allow Jews to imagine Israel and Israel's God in registers that violent nationalism had made them forget.  In order to move from second-temple Judaism into second-century Christianity, one does well to go through Jesus of Nazareth as presented in the New Testament.  I did not come up with that thesis, of course; it's the main claim of N.T. Wright's magisterial book The New Testament and the People of God (a book that Aslan does not ever address, though he does mention that Wright wrote a book on the doctrine of resurrection (261)).  In other words, given the same set of historical data, one can construct two very different accounts of how first-century Bible-reading and first-century political history related to one another.  I would maintain that the one I was taught (by some very skilled New Testament professors as well as by Wright's books) is more adequate to the history of interpretation, but that claim does not stand alone as a \\"purely historical\\" perspective any more than Aslan's does; history remains an inherently rhetorical enterprise, and how one frames the data will always matter.<br /><br />No Room for Dialectic<br /><br />At stake when histories clash is not merely the history of hermeneutics, of course: on a larger scale, there's the question of how historical change happens in the first place.  The way that the historians I'd read before tended to narrate the emergence of second-century Christianity out of second-temple Judaism followed roughly the outline that Wright articulates: the horizon of possibilities for Jewish traditions in the first century included, but was not limited to, the nationalist-revolutionary possibility, certainly, but that tradition, because of the inherent plurality of the Scriptures (especially those read in Synagogues, since those included the prophets) also involved texts like Genesis 12, in which God promises that Abraham's seed will bless all nations; Isaiah 2, in which the nations come to Jerusalem not as conquered prisoners but as seekers of wisdom; Jonah, in which a thoroughly wicked pagan city turns to YHWH in recognition of its own wretchedness; and Daniel 1-6, in which a succession of pagan monarchs, because of the faithfulness of exiled Jews, come to embrace the true God YHWH.  Those currents of Biblical witness do not eliminate rabidly nationalist texts like Joshua and Ezra and Nahum; but neither do the nationalist texts nullify the universalist ones.  Instead, according to Biblical theologians like Walter Brueggemann, that tension results in a dialectic tension between the two historical possibilities.<br /><br />None of those possibilities, unfortunately, shows up in Zealot.  To read Reza Aslan's account of the Hebrew Bible, the entire text is nothing but Jewish nationalism, page after page of xenophobia without exception.  If anything like the universality of John 3 or Matthew 28 or Acts 1 creeps into the story of Jesus, it must have happened because Diaspora Jews, eager to flatter their new Roman masters after the fall of Jerusalem, inserted those passages to falsify the true nature of Jesus.  If Jesus used the phrase \\"kingdom of God,\\" it was \\"a call to revolution, plain and simple\\" (120).  Anything that suggests a more capacious (and philosophically complex) notion of the kingdom of God, especially one that isn't secured by armed force, must be a move to placate the Romans (150).  Aslan's view of Jesus's reception is a zero-sum game: if the violent revolutionary is to diminish, it can only give way to philosophical schools (like those of the Diaspora Jews) that already existed.  There is no room for the tensions inherent in the Biblical tradition, not to mention the broad international phenomenon of post-exilic Judaism, to blossom, with the help of a revolutionary figure (my pick would be Jesus of Nazareth) to take Judaism in directions that Judaism had trouble, in that moment, imagining.<br /><br />I prefer to think of history as inherently dialectical, that Jesus, considered in historical terms (I also confess Jesus as a Person of the Trinity, but one gets to the Trinity only through the Palestinian Jew on a cross, I'm inclined to think), might have been a figure who could grab hold of the universalist AND the nationalist strains of the Hebrew Bible, insisting that the ethics of the Kingdom would be an intensification rather than a nullification of the Torah (which also seems to be what Paul was doing, but more on that later) AND envisioning something like what Isaiah and Daniel set forth as coming to its fullness in his own moment, in his own person.  Such a figure might look a fair bit like the Jesus that one finds in the synoptics, just as Wright indicates, and once again the strident opposition between the \\"Christ of faith\\" and the \\"Jesus of history\\" becomes an unfortunate missed opportunity to talk about both rather than dropping one or the other.<br /><br />A Fourth Guy Named John<br /><br />When I've taught the book of Revelation in churches (which has been all too frequently lately), one question that surfaces early is whether the same John who was the son of Zebedee is the one in exile on Patmos.  In response, I usually ask a counter-question, namely how many people named John appear in the New Testament.  It usually doesn't take long to generate at least three: John the Baptist, John the son of Zebedee, and John-Mark, who appears in Acts.  There might be more, but those three suffice for the explanation.  If there are three men named John that we can remember that fast, I ask, what's the probability that they were the only three men named John in the early church?  The point is that I don't put much stock in questions of New Testament authorship (the contests over such things don't, in my own theology, matter nearly as much as questions of the history of the texts in their role as canon), and I'd say it's at least as probable that there's a fourth guy named John, who composed Revelation but neither the gospel nor the epistles, as it is that there were only three Johns affiliated  with the New Testament.<br /><br />All of that is to note that early Christianity seems to have grown broad fairly quickly, encompassing people from all sorts of tribes inside of and outside the Roman Empire within a couple centuries.  In order to account for that, Reza Aslan articulates a hypothesis regarding the career of Paul which seems to assume several difficult things.  One must assume that there was only one group in early Christianity interested in the Torah of Moses, and that was the Christian assembly in Jerusalem.  One must assume that any appearance of reconciliation between Antioch and Jerusalem in the New Testament is an act of deception.  One must assume that James and Peter remained enemies of Paul for the course of all the men's lives.One must assume, again, that no new thought is possible, that any change must result from the zero-sum destruction of one community and the rise of another.<br /><br />Never in Reza Aslan's telling of the story is there room for two groups concerned with the Law, perhaps one with its base in Jerusalem and another in the synagogues of Galilee, or for that matter any other group anywhere else.  If there were people trying to turn the churches in Galatia and Corinth towards adherence to circumcision and kosher-diet laws, they must have been agents of James, the brother of Jesus, according to Reza Aslan.  Such does not have to be the case, of course.  The way I was taught in New Testament studies classes and in my own previous reading, the book of Galatians, as well as passages from other Pauline epistles, arise as a response to a group that scholars have designated \\"the Judaizers\\" because little is known about them beyond their penchant for convincing converts from outside of ethnic Judaism to undergo circumcision and to eat kosher so that they can become \\"real Christians.\\"  (That makes them somewhat akin to the angel-cult referred to in the early verses of Hebrews and the proto-Gnostics against which 1 John seems to inveigh.)  Paul, according to my own reading, does battle with this group because they defy the content of the gospel, which has emerged in the wake of the work of Jesus, and those folks are seeking to undo that.  In the way that I learned, back in the mid-nineties, such groups are historically the \\"losers\\" of a grand contest but theologically those rough edges against which the early Church sharpened its own doctrines of Christ for the benefit of future generations.  Either way, the historical speculation that there was only one Torah-concerned group of Jesus-followers in the entirety of the first century is an unnecessary narrowing of possibilities.<br /><br />Reza Aslan, for whom there is no historical dialectic, will hear none of it.  In his version, the \\"Judaizers\\" can only be agents of James, the brother of Jesus, who tells Paul to his face, in Jerusalem in Acts 15, that Gentiles need not be bound by the Torah, save for those regulations governing resident aliens, but waits until Paul leaves Jerusalem to start sending agents into the cities where Paul has evangelized in order to do just what he promised not to do (192).  Within the lifetimes of James and Paul, Jerusalem became ascendant among the new Jesus movement, so that James was the \\"uncontested leader\\" (200) of the first-century movement.  But as Zealot tells it, the influx of Gentiles into the diaspora assemblies, along with the death of James and the destruction of Jerusalem, led to the ascendancy of Pauline Son-of-God worship-which is an entirely different religion from the Jesus-following of James and Peter (196)-and the eventual relegation of the true Christianity of James and Peter to the heresy-label of Ebionite (272).  So in the story that Zealot tells, James, the good guy, eventually loses, posthumously, to that grand villain Saul of Tarsus.  Never mind that Paul's ethical teachings, whether one looks at Romans or 1 Corinthians or Philippians, seem to be rooted intelligibly in Torah traditions, modified (not unlike in Acts 15) for the sake of unity among the faithful.  James is the good guy, so what he does to Paul is because Paul hates the Torah.  (Can I hear a me genoitai?)<br /><br />Considering the outright duplicity of James in Aslan's reading (he does, after all, crawfish on St. Paul), the final full chapter of the book is a bit surprising.  Having established Paul as the great villain of early Christianity, Aslan turns back to James, the brother of Jesus, to establish him, at the end of the book, as the true hero of the story, perhaps moreso than Jesus himself.  A man concerned with Israel and Israel only, Zealot paints him as someone who resists the Roman temptation of Stephen and Paul to maintain a truly local religious tradition untilthe same empire that so loves Christianity, Paul-style, crushes it underfoot.  Aslan identifies himself as \\"a committed disciple of Jesus of Nazareth\\" (as opposed to Jesus the Christian figure) in the book's introduction (xx), but the last chapter shows that Jesus, for Zealot, is largely a cipher, a bit of blank space that precedes the real hero of the story, James the Just.  Historical orthodox Christianity, in the story that Zealot tells, is an unfortunate usurper of the true Christianity, a Roman religion almost entirely unrelated to the teknon from Nazareth, and with the stoning of Stephen, the historical Jesus disappears from the religious world (169).<br /><br /> A Manifesto of Sorts<br /><br />Aslan has protested in interviews that I've heard, but I still maintain that I for one would never have heard of him had his Fox News interview in July not gone viral.  My hunch is that most of our readers would not have either.  But that's beside the point now: Reza Aslan is, for the moment, a name that church folks have heard, and that presents an opportunity for Christian teachers.  With a bit of reading (I recommend Wright's New Testament and the People of God, or The Challenge of Jesus for a briefer, more accessible read) and some research at a local library, we can take advantage of the increased awareness of and interest in the historical contexts of the New Testament, and with a book like Zealot in the spotlight as solidly as it is, the rhetorical character of his thesis is quite evident.<br /><br />Christianity, we must say and repeat and insist upon, has nothing to fear from responsible history.  As I noted above, the military history, political history, and etymological work that Reza Aslan does is perfectly fine; the difference is not that the Christian faithful deny the historical data but that we insist on interpreting it in ways that acknowledge that they're interpretations.  That's the real sticking point here: where historians deny that they're being rhetorical, we Christians need to be clear that our histories, their histories, and any history worth calling history is always interpretation, always the disciplined arrangement (that's one of the canons of rhetoric) of what investigations yield.  That's what makes history so interesting, and when people try to cut out that part of things for the sake of scoring points with the credulous (or for book sales, let's be honest), then we must be on hand to offer a compelling alternative, one that reminds any with ears to hear that stories are always stories, and the true stories are true not because they stop being stories but because they disclose truth where other stories ignore what is true.<br /><br />If Reza Aslan remains visible for very long (which is never guaranteed, especially as prone to diversion as we are in 2013), I would recommend that Christian teachers get a copy of his book (the image above links to the amazon page for it) and prepare to have conversations about history, truth, and other reasons for our hope.  My hunch is that such confidence in our confession could only stand to benefit the Way that we proclaim.<br /><br />Re-Posted from The Christian Humanist.  If anything like the universality of John 3 or Matthew 28 or Acts 1 creeps into the story of Jesus, it must have happened because Diaspora Jews, eager to flatter their new Roman masters after the fall of Jerusalem, inserted those passages to falsify the true nature of Jesus.  If Jesus used the phrase \\"kingdom of God,\\" it was \\"a call to revolution, plain and simple\\" (120).  Anything that suggests a more capacious (and philosophically complex) notion of the kingdom of God, especially one that isn't secured by armed force, must be a move to placate the Romans (150).  Aslan's view of Jesus's reception is a zero-sum game: if the violent revolutionary is to diminish, it can only give way to philosophical schools (like those of the Diaspora Jews) that already existed.  There is no room for the tensions inherent in the Biblical tradition, not to mention the broad international phenomenon of post-exilic Judaism, to blossom, with the help of a revolutionary figure (my pick would be Jesus of Nazareth) to take Judaism in directions that Judaism had trouble, in that moment, imagining.<br /><br />I prefer to think of history as inherently dialectical, that Jesus, considered in historical terms (I also confess Jesus as a Person of the Trinity, but one gets to the Trinity only through the Palestinian Jew on a cross, I'm inclined to think), might have been a figure who could grab hold of the universalist AND the nationalist strains of the Hebrew Bible, insisting that the ethics of the Kingdom would be an intensification rather than a nullification of the Torah (which also seems to be what Paul was doing, but more on that later) AND envisioning something like what Isaiah and Daniel set forth as coming to its fullness in his own moment, in his own person.

B005K17RU0|5.0|This app just got better with the update. I use every day before I go to work. That way I know if we can get any wood on the ground.
B0064W667Y|5.0|After having watched two seasons of &#34;Once Upon a Time,&#34; I couldn't help but wonder what inspired its creation. I think that may have been &#34;Fables.&#34; Strong on plot, it seems, it does a great job of eliminating any original impressions that fairy tales create for their characters. (Who would have thought that Prince Charming would be a moocher and a philanderer?!) Doing so, &#34;Fables&#34; makes its characters more human, more fallible.
B0064MGU98|5.0|The writing and acting in this series--at least, this season--is superb. What I especially enjoy are the portrayals of INartful lawyers--very bright, but just not good on their feet in court, which make the clearest case for the protagonist being, in fact, \\"a natural\\" and a darned good litigator.  Moreover, the portrayal of her ambivalence toward her husband is one of the best treatments done yet on \\"the betrayed political spouse\\", taking it out of the \\"genre\\" and into reality.  Last point: the portrayal of life inside this thriving law firm is realistic, but nonetheless provides substantial and nuanced support for the position that lawyers are presented with real and thorny ethical dilemmas on a weekly basis, strive to be principled, and care about doing good.  A refreshing break from the unrelenting lawyer bashing we tend to see on TV.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I'm sitting here typing like a crying blubbering idiot. This book has made me look at life in a different light and grateful for what I have. I just can't help but  selfishly wish for a different ending. I understand why the book had to end this way but it still breaks my heart. I'm going to end this  review and go hug my kids than plan a family vacation.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is great for streaming content.  Works seemlessly with Youtube from laptops or mobile devices, great integration to Netflix (again mobile device experience is great).<br /><br />Very neat that any device in the house can launch content on the chromecast.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|The theme is sort of a &#34;who moved my cheese&#34; thing.  Loved it and immedately referred it to my 14 year old daughter whom it turns out had already read it.  Should be required reading for all young people, before they become unmalleable.
0525478817|5.0|THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SOME BIG SPOILERS ABOUT THE BOOK, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR THEM DON'T READ THE REVIEW!<br />John Green did an absolutely amazing job at writing this novel. I was hooked from the very first page all the way until the end. Hazel and Augustus are perfect for each and I love the foreshadowing Green has in this book. SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT! For example, when Hazel and Augustus are on their way to Amsterdam in a plane, they both press the button to play the movie at the exact same time, yet Augustus's movie plays first. Well why would his movie play first if they pressed it at the same exact time? Green foreshadows Augustus dying first by doing this. How? Well if his movie starts first, then it has to end first, right? Well his life started first, so it's going to end before Hazels. Movies don't last that long, neither does our lives. This isn't any coincidence, Green meant to do that!<br /><br />This book should be read by high schoolers and young adults because of some inappropriate parts.Also, it had curse words that pop up quite a bit and it does have the \\"f\\" word in it once.<br /><br />This book is my most favorite book, and I have read many books, so that's pretty hard to become a favorite! LOL<br />okay. okay. (Read the book to understand what that means(; )
B006PZBRCY|5.0|This is a fun movie for anyone in the family, kids or adults. You have to watch it in HD because the visuals are stunning. If you have a 3D SmartTV, definitely enable the 3D. Its fantastic!<br /><br />The story was fun, great cast, great acting. I can't say anything negative about Real Steel except &#34;If you miss it, you missed out!&#34;

B00DD1X99C|5.0|Wow, some of the tracks on this album have the most funk/soul in Elvis' band that I have ever heard. Elvis sounds great himself and the blend of songs is pretty darn good. Worth having if your an Elvis fan.
B005LAIIN0|1.0|I bought this item because I wanted the DVD of the UNRATED cut, but the unrated cut is only available on the Blueray version (for which I have no use), while the DVD contains the rated version, which you could get also for less money. Basically, the cover of this edition (&#34;New Unrated Cut with intense footage not shown in theaters&#34;) is a cheating: it promises something which only applies to one of the two versions, but without specifying this fact. I am wondering how many people just wasted their money by buying this edition because they expected to get the DVD with the Unrated Cut.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Great show. The ending did not disappoint. I watched the series on BBCAmerica, but missed the last one and had to but it here.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I was skeptical. When this movie first premiered.<br /><br />After watching it,I loved,revitalized all the character and did the series justice.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is do easy to use! Just like a regular calculator and memory function is great for keeping a running checkbook balance.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Very interesting book. I started reading the book before I watched the movie but didn't get very far. The book as always is way better than the movie. I'm already on book 3.
B0037VNX44|3.0|Well made.  Excellent performances but...  Whatever.  Fourteen more words required.  This is the first time I've ever had trouble making a word quota.  Usually there's not enough space.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I haven't seen the movie but love this game!  It's very addicting and hard to put down.  If I were a child I'd have to limit the time, but the best part of being an adult is I can play however long I want!
B0033AI48Y|5.0|Incredible performance !!! It's no wonder Roberto Benigni won the Academy Award for Best Actor. A must have for your film library.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|has some of the most dumb ways you could die.In the game you follow instrutions so that the people don't die. It is very stupid and not suggested for very immature children.
0525478817|5.0|It was one of those books where I'm laughing and the next thing you know you're in tears! Such a great read
B00DY951RQ|5.0|The 10th volume of the bootleg series had not to be missed by Dylan's fan.<br />You can feel the taste of those years and the different way to sing the same song.<br />I think that the luxe edition is certainly better compared with the basic for the presence of the concert with The Band and (obviously) and for the excellent package.<br />Probably someone can say that same songs are present in different CDs but I think that this is not a problem....is Dylan's style!<br />In my opinion it had to be in all collectors' rack.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|We love this series, and finally decided to buy the first season. It arrived quickly, and in perfect shape. What more can we say?
B00F35BV64|5.0|More interesting, more fun.<br /><br />Great background for future plot lines enabling the viewer to understand the how and why of later versions.<br /><br />See it!
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|this game is so much fun. it keeps you on your toes. it's got so many different boards to it. i would recommend this game to everyone. i intend to buy more.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Orphan Train is quite gripping, the author had me interested in the book from the beginning until the end. The only part of the book that I was disappointed in was the &#34;history&#34; part...I thought there would be more. I also was hoping to read something about the Child Agency apologizing. Oh well, i guess you can't have it all!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|The show is so good I am watching episodes over and over.  Great anti hero. Your sympathies are pulled all over the place.

B00B2YH7BS|5.0|I've watched this three full times since it has arrived.  Intertwining the story of Sound City and the recording of a new album on the studio's console keeps my interest the whole time.  Great music.  Highly recommend.
B005SAP45I|5.0|Very entertaining!  Pack with action, my family enjoyed Cars 2 more than the first. We have watched it non stop!
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I love this version of Jane Eyre. A friend has argued that the most recent BBC version is better, but I love this one. Fassbender is perfect as Rochester and Wasikowska is a wonderful Jane. My friend feels the BBC version is closer to the novel. I decided to re-read the novel, watch the BBC version and decide. I believe that I'll still love this version.<br /><br />The pacing and editing is perfect. The story moves around from present day to Jane's past at Lowood school. The scenery, costumes, lighting, sets - all are perfect. You'll love it.
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|Yes, watch this if you want to know how to survive our political corruption and lack of moral times.  Yes, watch this if you want to know what to teach your children and grandchildren so they can survive what is coming after our corporate/governmental greed destroys our food and environment.  Yes, watch this if you want to understand the never-ending relationships of parents and children.  Yes, watch this to understand what truely loving the human race means to the human species.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Only played a few levels but it is nicely made. Sling shot is a nice effect.ads are like iPhone games plays and then you close.as long as I don't have to add friends to play I will continue.
B00FGFVMGA|1.0|Runtime error on every install!! I have tried to install four times! Bugs need fixed. I LOVE maple fire games but this needs serious work!!
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I recommend this app for chess playing people. It has great settings that you can change (difficulty, 1-2 players, etc.) and as far as I can tell, it has helped me improve my chess skills and strategies. Also great for road trips, airplane flights, and just at home!
0451419243|5.0|I had looked forward to reading this second of the trilogy by Follett and wasn't disappointed; couldn't wait to meet the characters again! What a wonderful way to read history. the author has done his homework in researching all the aspects of the impact of war on the countries involved and interweaving the character's lives as they are affected.<br /><br />Can't wait for the final book!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I like the lower profile of this versus the USB car charger I used to use. My power port is right near my gear selector and a large charger can prevent me from getting in and out of gear. With most cables this one has enough clearance. I bought it because it also supports full charging an iPad.
1451668945|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark's books are my favorite read.  I have enjoyed everyone of her books for more that 40 years.  Just wish she would write more than one a year.
B00847KFDS|4.0|Loved CCR, and this doesn't disappoint, the voice is unmistakable, and unique, again need to listen to it more to get right into the music.
B00009M6VJ|4.0|Passionate abolitionist and philosophy professor David Gale (Kevin Spacey) is on death row in a Texas prison awaiting execution for the rape and murder of a fellow DeathWatch activist, Constance Harraway (Laura Linney). Gale had previously been accused of the rape of a former student, Berlin (Rhona Mitra), although he was subsequently cleared. Gale secures a huge fee from a magazine to give a series of three two-hour interviews on the last three days of his life with one of their successful investigative journalists, Bitsey Bloom (Kate Winslet). The story is therefore told retrospectively and Bloom uncovers increasing amounts of evidence to suggest that Gale is innocent. But there are other individuals involved who support or oppose the death penalty. This is an exciting story directed by Alan Parker and we don't know until the very end whether or not Gale is innocent.
B00DXP7L88|3.0|Yes, unfortunately it happened. \\"Dexter\\" came to an end.  I've seen every one of the ninety-six episodes of the show (some of them several times, my personal favorite being episode #84) and I don't think it's fair to say that Season 8 was weak. It wasn't as strong as Seasons 1-4 or as Season 7 but we were introduced to some interesting, compelling characters (Dr. Vogel, for example) and to unexpected turns in the story. For me, Season 8 started falling appart in episode 94: The conclusion of the show was really disappointing. When I finished watching the last episode I realized that maybe it's just too hard to end a remarkable show with a bang. Look what happened at the conclusion of \\"Seinfeld\\" back in 1998. I have been imagining different scenarios for the ending of \\"Dexter\\" and I haven't been able to come up with one that I would have found completely satisfying (I always envisioned Dexter being killed on the last episode.) All I can say is that \\"Dexter\\" was indeed a remarkable show. Kudos to the writers, producers and actors. Your work will be deeply missed.
B002R27J1W|4.0|I'm Very happy with the video. The video is about 95 percent free of scratches and damage marks on the screen. I understand a new remake is coming out this year. I will be purchasing it as well. Delivery was fast.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|An excellent read!  I'm having a hard time coming up with the right words for how much I loved this book. There are not too many books with plot twists that genuinely surprise me...this one did!<br />Secrets and betrayals and love and family.<br />This is a simply amazing book!
B00B8PRDHE|5.0|This is a wonderful DVD of people who i grew up listening to. Love it! Ringo still can't sing a lick but his energy is wonderful to see! It is an all-star cast of players.
1401938906|5.0|Great way of showing us how we can know the universe is working with us. The small things we brush off are the big signs that it's there for us. Be thankful for the signs and more appear to you.
140006922X|5.0|I saw the author on TV talk about this book and it sparked my interest.  Reza Aslan does a great job of telling us about the history of the period which Jesus lived.  The author presents a great deal of knowledge that is not found in any one place.  His education in theology of several religions brings a great deal of interest to those of us who want to know more about the Christian religion history.<br />Excellent book; good reading for people of all religions.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Love this book. It didn't make me laugh out loud but I was constantly chuckling under my breath. Easy read, I finished it in 2 days of casual reading.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|very well written book.  Sunday school class went through this study but I wasn't able to be in there.  Book explains itself.  I've enjoyed it!
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|I was really looking forward to this movie, but the best parts were in the previews.  I won't give away the movie, but honestly, I was really let down by it.  The graphics were amazing!  As a photographer and graphic designer, I absolutely LOVED the graphics.  Beyond that, the storyline and acting wasn't worth the rental.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone.  However, I wish the series had not ended...it could continue for quite a while and I would not be tired of it.
B00000DRA9|5.0|Loved it from many years ago in the mid-eighties and realized I'd forgotten to ever buy my own copy.  Wonderful to listen to.

B0036EH3UC|5.0|BSG sets the bar for what a SF series should be, and this  comes from a die hard ST fan. The 5 stars is for BSG itself. As for the packaging and quality of the DVD's, 3 stars would be more indicative.
B00CLL1UY6|5.0|When a book opens before you, you expect to enter into a new reality--here, it is dropped upon you with a rarely seen immediacy. From the very first sentence, when the Serbian doctor tells Vera, &#34;I am afraid I won't be able to save his leg,&#34; you understand in your bones how hard she tries to remain composed, so as not to frighten her son. Having stepped on a rusty nail, Sebastian has been hiding his injury from her, which is about to cost him dearly: the amputation of his leg, and the blow to the way he perceives himself at this sensitive age, both of which will eventually drive him to find his bearings, as he must. And not only he must overcome the limitations of his handicap, and come into his own-so must other characters, such as his frail mother. This is a time of war. We must all grow up. We must all find our inner power.<br /><br />The author, Christoph Fischer, has drawn life in Vienna with vivid detail, illustrating the intricacies of the pre-World War I era with great imagination, which is underpinned by careful research of historical aspects. As the father leaves for war, Sebastian is charged with being the man in the family; not an easy task for any young man, and it is even more of a challenge for Sebastian. His is an imbalanced, stilted world, controlled by the women left behind, both his mother and the mother of his beloved Margit, who makes her daughter leave him and follow her to Galicia, in search of her father. I was reminded of several women in my own family, and smiled with awe and affection at the amazing (if sometimes annoying) power and initiative of Jewish mothers...<br /><br />I am yet to read the first part of The Three Nations Trilogy, The Luck of the Weissensteiners. But to tell you the truth, sometimes I like reading one volume of of a trilogy out of order, to see if it holds on its own. Sebastian does.<br /><br />Highly recommended. Five stars.<br /><br />This book was sent to me gratis for an unbiased review.
B004GYY714|4.0|I absolutely love this radio station.  Very little commercials & great music all the time.  I have no complaints at all.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|It's a fascinating discussion of being black in Africa and America.  Also an opportunity to learn about Africa.  She writes extremely well and the plot is compelling.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|We are hooked on this story, understand the accents, after living in England for 2 years.  It is a good thing to watch when we don't have time to watch a longer movie.  We like it very much.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got obsessed with it so I play it to much . So I had to stop for a while .but then I got back on
1476729085|5.0|I have read some excellent books this year, you know the ones - just can't put them down - but so far THE ROSIE PROJECT is top of the pile.  It is an outstanding book, so compelling that I challenge you to read it and not be hooked. It is poignant, humourous and not to be missed.  So why am I raving over it?  Because it is good!<br /><br />The hero is Don a super intelligent man who doesn't realise he has Asperger's.  Is this possible?  Of course it is.  Don knows he is different to other people, that he is often considered weird by some, but human behaviour baffles him.  His friends recognise the symptoms and try to prompt him to realization:<br />\\"...Claudia asked whether I had enjoyed the Asperger's Lecture.  She was under the impression that Gene had delivered the lecture and I had merely attended. I corrected her mistake and told her I had found the subject fascinating.  \\"Did the symptoms remind you of anyone?\\" she asked...\\"<br /><br />However Don doesn't pick up on the hints and decides to find a wife.  Enter Rosie, who is the complete opposite to Don in every way utterly spontaneous, dresses to please herself and tough.  Rosie also thinks that the man who her mother was married to isn't really her father, and that her mother slept with a man at her graduation ball and one of those men is her father.  Only she doesn't know who the man is.  Don offers to DNA test all the father suspects which turns out to be well over 100 - how they pursue this goal of collecting DNA samples is hilarious.  As they spend time together Rosie encourages Don to be spontaneous, hard for someone who doesn't even recognise that he has upset someone.<br /> \\"...'But I'm not good at understanding what other people want.'  `Tell me something I don't know,' said Rosie for no obvious reason. I quickly searched my mind for an interesting fact. `Ahhh...The testicles of drone bees and wasp spiders explode during sex.'...\\"<br /><br />THE ROSIE PROJECT is unique in that it is one of the only romances that I have read told from the point of a male.  It also gives a convincing insight into what it's like to be someone with Asperger's and how others perceive him.  His intensely logical thought processes just don't make sense to some of the people he mixes with.  However those who are close to him see his heart of gold and the genuine bewilderment at people's reactions and guide him into what he should do to make amends. There is a lot of progress with Don's character from the start of the book to the end. At the start he is stuck in his safe and predictable rut where he over-analyses everything, worries about making changes and then embraces the change and ends up recognising that he is in love. Seeing that THE ROSIE PROJECT is a romance, and allowing that opposites attract, the ending is satisfactorily predictable and the back story threads were all tied off neatly as well. Author Graeme Simsion is currently working on a sequel to The Rosie Project which is due for release in Australia sometime in 2014. I for one will be doing everything in my power to get my hands on that sequel.<br /><br />With thanks to Simon & Schuster and the author via Netgalley for this copy.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|this movie updates to the screen with great grace.  the story keeps you interested and informed so you do not loose watching this (tail) about dog and a man. I think a must see.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I read this book over a three day period.  I was locked in from the moment I turned the first page.  The one thing about Stephen King is his ability to pull you into the story.  You feel as though you must keep reading to know what happens next and then next after that.<br /><br />  I was young when I saw the shining.  I will be going to Netflix and watching this movie again.  I remember the movie but never understood it. I think a watch now will prove to be a joyful ride that I would like to take again.  As with The Shining and Pet Semetary, this needs to be in a movie,  it would be superb.<br /><br />Mr,  King, thanks for another joyful adventure through your unusual world,
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a fantastic book!  Loved how the author intertwined the various speakers. It kept my attention and had me wanting more.  This is rare in many of the books I have read recently.  I will definitely be keeping my eye on this author.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I downloaded this series onto my IPAD, and find it to be so wonderful.<br />The acting, the storylines, and the entire production just keeps getting better and better --- Masterpiece has done it again!<br />There is simply no series that is better anywhere.

B00DYTKKGI|4.0|This is a good game for young children. It teaches eye hand coordination and also how to care for someone. I could see it being useful if your child was afraid to go to the doctor too.
B00FEHXISA|4.0|There are a few things that could of been done differently but it didn't take away from the movie at all.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I couldn't figure out how Downton Abbey could top seasons 1 and 2 but somehow, the show did!  I'm happy to say that the level of excellence in the acting, the character studies, the storylines has not diminished in this season 3 of the series.<br />I am totally hooked on this show and recommend it highly to everyone who enjoys the best of TV.
B000002GIE|5.0|AWESOME debut album from Exterme........The Heaviest of the band's release's. A shame that Nuno and Gary couldn't get along,  There second albom was GREAT........Third......Not so much.

B004SD5GZ4|3.0|I haven't needed this app yet . I needed it in the past and didn't have it . So I have gotten the app as just incase . Like a spare tire on the car . :)
0446310786|4.0|Quick delivery. Product as expected. Some wear and tear, but nothing that I did not expect. Great product for a student that could use the notes.
0679731369|3.0|This book is a confusing blend of styles and points of view, as required by meta-fiction outlines.  However, just keep reading it to enjoy Julian Barnes wonderfully funny and skillful prose.  If you do not analyze and try to make complete sense of the book, which is a daunting task, you can sit back, read and smile.
B001NLL93W|5.0|LOVE THIS SERIES...GREAT MESSAGE...COULD NOT WAIT TO START ON THE NEXT ONE.  MAY BE A LITTLE TOO GRAPHIC FOR YOUNGER READERS.
B000M2O6AQ|4.0|I had read this book when it first came out and I also watched the movie when it first came out.  I really think it is important to read the book and see the movie....I think reading the book first is better but either way it is a great spiritual journey worth taking.
0857680986|5.0|I am not able to attend art school and I felt like I was at a disadvantage because I didn't have any instruction to supplement the few figure drawing classes I have taken. Well this book made me feel more confident and just reading the Loomis' commentary is very soothing within itself. He explains things so well and simply. Whenever I need to feel inspired and uplifted to draw, I just read a segment from this book and I learn some new insight every time. It's seriously a good book to have for any artist and it's of great benefit for artists today to learn from artists from the past. Just the commentary in the opening pages alone is enough to make me love this book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I enjoy this series so much. Love  the dress and  sets!  Story line unique. Good historical reference. Hope we get many more years of story line.
B008ZDC7M8|1.0|If you had to attend a slide show because you were staying at Uncle Dufus' house for Thanksgiving, and your mother told you you had to be polite, you could at least make fart and snore noises.  Mark Cousins is a complete idiot.  He does not use a fact-checker and I am sure he did not ask for any peer reviews.  He is afraid of criticism.  If you had a high school student who was assigned \\"Kurosawa\\" and looked up the Cliff Notes and said, \\"Oh, better cover 'Ikiru' because the critics say it's his greatest film, and better cover 'Seven Samurai' because it's his most popular,\\" that's what he does.  He says regarding \\"Ikiru,\\" \\"The man was born in the feudal period and can't find his place in the modern world.\\"  Wrong!  Cousins is just like Lucy walking around telling Charlie Brown scientific explanations which she just made up.  The protagonist of \\"Ikiru\\" knows his place and that with terminal cancer he's going to disappear without a trace, but that's not what drives his character.  He circumvents the red tape in his department to help the mothers in the neighborhood to build a playground because he wants to create some minor goodness in the world before he dies.<br /><br />Then regarding \\"Seven Samurai,\\" Cousins says, \\"Katsushiro has become the greatest swordsman of them all.\\"  The character \\"Kyuzu\\" caught Cousins' eye and Cousins is too lazy to look up that he's named \\"Kyuzu.\\"  Katsushiro is the youngest of the seven samurai.  Kyuzu is the ronin who lives to perfect his art of sword-fighting.<br /><br />Cousins says \\"Katsushiro\\" -- meaning Kyuzu -- \\"throws his sword away.  The era of the sword is over.  The era of the gun has begun.  The film is set in the past, but it echoes in the Fifties, because it's about the beginning of a new era.\\"  Kyuzu throws his sword at the enemy as a last act of defiance.  A samurai does not suddenly develop frustration with his sword and throw it away.  Kurosawa introduced the bandits' guns as an obstacle for the samurai.  The film is not about \\"the beginning of a new era.\\"  It's about idealism.  It's about Kurosawa'a idea of a hero, someone with compassion, someone who has \\"superhero\\" powers, and someone who risks his life.  The fact that the bandits have guns, or that the peasants are only willing to pay the samurai daily food, or that the peasants turn out to have jewelry and sake and other valuables buried under their houses, are all obstacles Kurosawa introduces to make the samurai more heroic.<br /><br />Also as someone pointed out on IMDb, Cousins says Americans were only interested in making escapist musicals, starring for example Betty Grable, during WWII.  He says Italian Neo-Realism after the war precipitated American film noir.  This is ridiculous.  The Germans were making dark crime films in the 1920s, German Expressionism.  The French were making film noir -- it's a French name -- in the 1930s.  The Americans were making noirs in the early 1940s.  Cousins uses \\"Open City\\" as an example of Italian Neo-Realism and the movie was not seen in America until 1946, then he cites \\"Double Indemnity\\" as a movie influenced by Italian Neo-Realism, which came out in 1944.  Really Cousins just got Cliff Notes and looked up \\"What is the most famous Italian Neo-Realist film?\\" and \\"What is the most famous film noir?\\"  His label for an Italian Neo-Realist film says, \\"The Bicycle Thieves.\\"  No, it's \\"The Bicycle Thief.\\"  Similarly his label for \\"Stray Dog\\" said \\"Stray Dogs\\" in the part about Kurosawa.  The name of the Kurosawa film comes from the saying, \\"A stray dog soon becomes rabid,\\" meaning a young man without a job soon turns to crime.  (It's hard for us to imagine now, but everybody was buying and selling on the black market in Japan after WWII.)<br /><br />Here is another one:  Episode 9, regarding \\"The Conversation\\" - \\"The man becomes obsessed with the mystery on the tape.  In doing so, he almost has a breakdown.\\"  \\"Coppola's film was about getting so lost in the fragments of other people's behaviors that your own life dissolves.\\"  Really?  This is how you summarize hearing a murder being planned, witnessing a murder, and being threatened with murder.  Why include a movie in your documentary if you have no idea what is going on in it?<br /><br />In Episode 12, regarding \\"Star Wars,\\" Cousins says:<br /><br />The film starts as a fairy tale.  A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.  The words drag backwards into deep space.  The soundtrack, recorded in the relatively new format of Dolby stereo, seems to take place in deep space, too.  It felt as if the cinema shook.  And then models of spaceships glided past such wide-angle lenses that they plunged into perspective, too, and looked enormous.  The camera moves were programmed by computers.  Then the film introduces us to Luke, who will become a knight and save the universe.  We're in the realm of myth, and the film's design conjures the myth.  Interiors look like caves or kitchens or spaceships.  There is talk of a mystical force.  Luke dresses like a samurai.  We meet two robots, little and large, a metallic odd couple, and we see optically projected a message from a princess asking for help.  We hear of an evil emperor who director George Lucas saw as the shamed American President, Richard Nixon. This is the most absurd plot we have yet heard in the story of film.<br /><br />*****<br /><br />No film historian providing commentary on a DVD would simply describe what appears.  You get captioning for the hearing-impaired for free, so why hire a film historian?  No one educated would say the camera moves were \\"programmed\\" by computers.  They were controlled by computers programmed by people.  (Here is a golden opportunity for Cousins to use his favorite word \\"innovative,\\" but he fancies himself too sophisticated to praise \\"Star Wars.\\"  John Dykstra got a special Academy Award for his pioneering work and the article in \\"American Cinematographer,\\" July 1977, in which he explains how to use a computer to synchronize the camera's passes over the spaceships, and how they matted them together so each frame might be a 64-item composite, is an expensive collector's item.  I remember xeroxing the whole article at the library, and then threw it away because the xeroxes were stinky and faded to illegible, because of the coated paper they used in the 1970s -- if only I had purchased the magazine!)  \\"The film's design conjures the myth.\\"  What is that supposed to mean?  A \\"space fantasy\\" movie, as Lucas called it, is designed to look like it is set in a fantasy world?  Duh.  \\"Interiors look like caves or kitchens or spaceships.\\"  Really?  Aren't you going to comment, \\"The character is breathing in.  Then he breathes out.\\"  I don't believe George Lucas modeled the Emperor character in \\"Star Wars\\" on Nixon.  Cousins might style himself a film historian, but he is so ignorant, saying the light sabers are based on spears -- \\"The robotic comic duo was based on two comic characters in Akira Kurosawa's 'The Hidden Fortress' . . . and the spears in Kurosawa's film became light-sabers in Lucas'\\" -- that he probably has never heard of Ming the Merciless, the emperor in \\"Flash Gordon,\\" who would make more sense if you want to suggest a basis for the Emperor in \\"Star Wars.\\"  The Emperor, Darth Vader, the princess in distress and Luke's mentor are stereotypes from \\"The Hero With a Thousand Faces,\\" which George Lucas credits as the source of his story along with \\"Flash Gordon.\\"<br /><br />If you record \\"Silent Sundays\\" on TCM, sometimes Rudolf Valentino as \\"The Sheik\\" or Greta Garbo as \\"The Mysterious Lady\\" is thrilling.  The only good thing about watching this documentary is being reminded to study film history.<br /><br />The Australians have that \\"uptalk\\" manner of speaking, inflecting every declarative as a question, and it never bothered me.

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Overall, I liked the book. At first, the stories were not remarkable; I even considered stopping.  But the stories started having more depth and made the book a lot more interesting.
B00FEHXISA|2.0|Long and tedious with no real plot in sight<br />Did not enjoy this movie...especially when compared to the others in the franchise
143911000X|5.0|I originally got it as a gag gift, but i leafed through the pages and am utterly surprised at this books awesomeness.... a great buy for any guy, friend or just a HIMYM fan...
B00EQNYOYU|4.0|This may be a slightly biased review since I have been listening to NIN since &#34;Pretty Hate Machine&#34; and have generally enjoyed all releases by the group. It seemed to me, however, that Trent Reznor had an experimental phase in the last 5 to 10 years that resulted in some good music, but it really didn't represent the classic NIN sound, in my opinion. Maybe that was the intent, and I can appreciate that for an artist. This album did bring me back to why I love the NIN sound so much. Reznor is undoubtedly a genius when it comes to making great music from the strangest of sounds. Sometimes hearing a track on the radio somehow ruins it for me, but &#34;Came Back Haunted&#34; still gets my head moving while I'm driving, no matter how many times I hear it on the radio. &#34;Everything&#34; is a track that I feel really doesn't blend with the rest of the album. It sounds a little bit like a pop song, but the rest of the album makes me forget that track is even there. &#34;I Would For You&#34; is the highlight for me, followed by a strong &#34;In Two.&#34; The last album by NIN that I've enjoyed this much is probably &#34;The Fragile.&#34; I won't go as far as to say it sounds the same, but my fire with NIN has been rekindled.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Good characters.  Good story lines.  Well written.  The characters have both a detestable side and a honorable side. Which makes them more human.  And I can't figure out why I like Vic Mackey and root for him so much (despite the despicable things he does in order to serve justice) but I do.  Perhaps it's because Michael Chiklis is so charismatic - great acting on his part.  Darn good television.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Okay Brad Pitt was very good , plot was lame and unbelievable but the action , suspense was very good.
B001KK2NDQ|5.0|This book contains lots of basic kitchen information that no home economics class provided when I was growing up. Her method of making scramble eggs results in a creamy texture that is very pleasing to the palate. She uses more salt than I'm used to, but that's easy to adjust.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Read the books first! They really are well written with great characters. The movies do not do the books justice. I love the actors they chose but I don't agree with their decision to make is PG-13. It compromises the story and waters down the message.
B005LAIH2C|3.0|This film recalls to me a recurring sketch on the old \\"Saturday Night Live\\" called \\"What If?\\".  It shouldn't be surprising that two of the film's producers are Will Ferrell and his longtime collaborator Adam McKay.  This film is an uneasy marriage of tongue-in-cheek humor and gory violent action.  That said the humor does make some of the more stomach churning effects palatable.  I did giggle at some of the gags notably the hand drawn pictures of missing children glued to clear glass milk bottles or the kid offering Gretel a bowl of porridge.  It's also pretty amusing making Hansel a diabetic.  The film is intermittently clever but wears out its welcome even at an economical eighty-seven minute running time.  This isn't a bad film but an eminently forgettable one.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|I won't give a long review. This album is simply the best work I've heard by the group to this date. Beginning to end, it is a pure pleasure to listen to this music. If you like QOTSA at all, add this to your collection. If you don't, maybe buy it anyway.
B005GP7F8Y|5.0|its a classic. i have enjoyed watching it with my husband and grandsons many times. we all loved it and looked forward to it. but we watched it on videotape. now my grandsons can watch on dvd... sadly my husband died may 2012....
B000ATQYT2|5.0|One of my family's absolute favorites! Even though my children are older, it is a tradition that we watch it every year.
B006BFK5DK|5.0|They've still got it.  Nice variety of songs - some instrumental and jazzy. As always, great vocals - great groove. Love the brass arrangements!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|My opinion is its a good game hard-ish but that's what makes it fun<br />Then again I just might be a bad player
B009AMAJPA|4.0|Victor (Colin Farrell) is a hit man for crime lord Alphonse(Terrence Howard) who is being harassed by an unseen enemy who is sending him cryptic messages.  Beatrice (Noomi Rapace) is a facially scarred beautician who lives in a high rise across from Victor and witnessed him murder somebody.  Beatrice blackmails Victor into killing the man responsible for her disfigurement or she'll alert the authorities.  You kind of know where this film is going.  Despite the predictability \\"Dead Man Down\\" is an above average thriller because the performances are vibrant and despite the familiarity director Niels Arden Oplev keeps the pace so exciting that you forget you're walking on familiar turf.
B00CWM3F4C|5.0|I feel AIC will never have the sound as they did with Layne, but William DuVall sure has big feet. The &#34;Black Gives Way To Blue&#34; album was good, but it feels like AIC has really found their sound with the new lead singer in &#34;The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here.&#34; The tracks &#34;Hollow&#34; and &#34;Stone&#34; are some serious, hard-rocking jams that get to my bones every time I listen to them. What I've noticed, and perhaps enjoyed, the most on this album is the abilities of Jerry and the gang to make you feel like you know what you're listening to, then change the feel mid to halfway through the song. And I don't mean this in a bad way. &#34;Breath On A Window&#34; and &#34;Hung On A Hook&#34; are excellent examples of progressions that move the listener through the song. This has been a great buy for me, and I feel a great buy for anyone that likes AIC. Definitely a solid piece of work, beginning through end, for the group.
B005WGIJNC|5.0|My grandson, who is 9, was thrilled to receive this on his birthday.  He told me that it was his favorite lego set.
B00ECU1A6C|5.0|Very solid addition to the my little pony universe. I enjoyed it immensely and was a very nice rent, not sure I'd want to own it though.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This is such a great concept, unfortunately it doesn't quite function as intended. After first getting the Chromecast up and running I noticed that it had no sound, and this is where it began. Not being a fan of dealing with tech problems I figured I would step away and come back to it in a few days. Once returning to try and get this item to work it no longer would appear on my tv or computer. So now I have a really cool concept that has no functionality. After being on the phone with Chromecast tech support they suggested that I reset my wi-fi settings, unplug my tv, reset my home router and internet. If this is what is necessary for this thing to work I will pass. If you want an item that works, just go with Apple TV and spend the extra money for an item that is reliable. If you're the type to buy something that doesn't work, then this is the perfect item for you to not watch movies or listen to music through.
B00499NHLC|4.0|speech gets a little fast but the plot is always interesting and not that predictable.  Character development is good and Benedict does a great job at strengthening the Sherlock legend
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|I was aghast when I heard they were making \\"The Great Gatsby\\" in 3-D.  Was I one of those film snobs who feel the classics should be made by Merchant-Ivory types and relegated to the arthouses?  Truth be told I last read F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel thirty years ago as part of an American Lit class.  Having now seen the film it's nothing short of brilliant.  Baz Luhrmann has breathed life into Fitzgerald's ninety year old work and made it accessible to the masses.  I don't think it was Fitzgerald's intent to only be enjoyed by the elites.  I'm going on recollection and as far as I can tell Luhrmann's version retains most of the original text.  I saw this film in 2-D so I can't really tell what 3-D adds to experiencing this film but it is an eyeful.  The vibrant art direction and costume design signify the excesses and decadence of the Roaring Twenties to a tee.  Despite the spectacle the performances are not overwhelmed by it but draw you into the characters.  This is definitely a film that will resonate for years to come.
0307593525|5.0|Mastering the Art of French Cooking is the best book I have studied for last 5 years. Julia Child gave me a real chance to feel more confident in my kitchen.
B005EGXNLS|5.0|An enjoyable work of historical fiction. I look forward to the next tale of Uhtred, and the struggle between the Anglo-Saxons and Danes.

B0095GSKDE|5.0|Another incredible book here by MG.  Outliers not only provides unique insight into the most successful entrepreneurs and business people, but also highlights the importance of the dedication and passion that is required to attain our dreams. Can't wait for David and Goliath!
B0081336FO|4.0|Very interesting and well done Sherlock, like the actors and well written script, updated version of old story .... will be waiting for season three
B00DYCBH4O|5.0|This is probably one of everyone's favorite classic novels. It certainly is one of my very favorite books and movies. I believe it is just as entertaining to read this story and it was to watch the movie. You can get obsessed with Mr. Darcy and Lizzie!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|family game fun, we are really enjoying this game of challenge all can play and join in lots of fun. jan
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Red is a belly laugh a minute and I cant believe they got away with that. The idiot that critiqued as a slow geriatric grind should be fired and not allowed to critique movies any longer. The action was fun and out there and the actors held up there end quite well so sit back and enjoy. Your never to old to kill the bad guys.
B003M6OW4Y|3.0|While the second season was interesting, it was not as well done as the first. Though it was one of the few shows I've ever seen that basically wrapped up everyone's story lines by the end.
B0094M2OPY|5.0|Lots to like about this movie: cute story, great songs, good looking. My 16 year old and 6 year old both find it enjoyable and need to watch it every year a Halloween.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I think they are good books, really kept you reading, but it's not one of those sagas or series that I can't simply wait to start reading again.<br />It's cruel, sad, intense, and romantic.<br />I liked at lot the first two, but I would've expect a better end or climax on the third book. Can't say I regret buying them, I enjoyed reading them, learning about the characters and the life they were leading.
B0050Q3UEM|5.0|Everyone who is anyone that listens to the genre electronica knows what Digitally Imported Radio is if not get it now
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really believe this is better than Temple run. There are so many unexpected surprises and you will not repeat the same exact run after you die either. It is also very addicting too my kids and myself love playing.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Star Trek this generation is hip cool and dares you to deny their status as saying same old same old which this isn't. The writers give you your moneys worth in this thrill ride.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who has lost a love one and helps to understand where they are and how it is a much better place for them and for us when our lives have been lived.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Loved the book. Loved the series even more. I can't believe it's over. The Sookie Stackhouse series has been a great journey & I am not ready for it to end.

B00DU74U74|4.0|The Host to my fianc&eacute; and I was a Romeo and Juliette tail. It made my girl cry and be all loving. My daughter had tears too and well if you guys are into chick flicks with action this is it. Enjoy we sure did.
B00DY951RQ|5.0|When Self Portrait was released, the &#34;Americana&#34; genre was still 25 years away. As usual, Dylan was VERY much ahead of his time! So now we get to hear the out-takes as well as the original album, and, guess what? NOW we get it! These sessions, along with &#34;Old & In The Way&#34; and &#34;Music From Big Pink&#34; broke open the way &#34;hip&#34; people thought about music. Thanks,Bob.
B004J4WKTW|1.0|This was a book club book. Results were either loved it or hated it.  Too long to much fantasy description.  Hard to follow time sequences
B000BMSU68|5.0|not just a great movie, but really good to see members of the cast talk about the making of the film too.  Class of  86 - we will go down in history!!!!!  nothing like high school in the 80s anymore.  if you missed it, im sorry.
B001EIOOWC|4.0|Viggo Mortensen Movies<br /><br />I like mortensen movies. He is able to take on various genre and still maintain his own unique perspective.
B001L62REY|5.0|Great movie. This movie just never gets old. Great actors if you can stand Daniel Day Lewis with long hair.
B00304VVII|3.0|This one is one of the best and I recommend it to the followers of Halo itself. It supersedes the live action one and demands you to pay attention to their tale and hang on for the ride.
B00F5F140U|3.0|After The Union I was expecting more out of this album.  Too much of the middle of the road music that Elton has fallen victim to.  I was hoping to hear more stuff like Monkey Suit harkening back to the old days.
B0022W6L6G|5.0|Excellent way to reflect on older days. Almost as good as the Rumors album where every song was a number one best seller.
B00ECL7ZJ2|4.0|I really, really like this album. It's like a few Michael Jackson-esque ideas sprinkled over a bed of Feist with a bit of Tom Petty/Stevie Nicks thrown in. It's really great. Poppy, but not too poppy. Inventive, but not without obvious influences. Rocking, but still soulful. I think everybody, 13-60ish, will like this.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Fun takes on mostly-familiar songs.... not your normal background instrumental music!  All of the songs are great, but I particularly love the island vibe of &#34;Over the Rainbow/Simple Gifts&#34;.  It reminds me of the island-influenced &#34;Over the Rainbow&#34; by the Hawaiian artist Iz.<br />Appeals to a wide range of musical tastes - everyone in my family will listen!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I really like this alarm. It's very efficient. Easy to use. The colors are nice, not to bright when you wake up and eyes haven't adjusted yet.
B0042KBYIQ|5.0|Not only is &#34;Nikita&#34; a great production, the program is an eye-opener of the possibilities as to what's going on behind the scenes within this country and throughout the world.  One of my favorites...
B007SGM084|1.0|Not realistic at all and there is no build up to sex. They have it all the time so that it becomes boring.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Fantastic. So good, after originally reading it on kindle, I will be buying it in a hard copy and adding it to my library slong with American Sniper, autobiography of Chris Kyle.
1780387105|5.0|I'm just a few pages into this great little songbook, but have already changed the way I play for the better. For instance, in the first lesson Mr. Sandercoe recommends what was for me a new way to form the A chord, which simplified the fingering on that first song immensely. (That song, btw, just happens to be Bob Marley's \\"Three Little Birds\\"--one of my all-time favorites.) And because Justin plays each of the songs at his website, you not only get to hear but also see how it's done. The selection of songs should please just about any moderately eclectic taste. They are arranged in levels of difficulty, but there is nothing keeping you from jumping around, which I did only a few moments ago when I opened up \\"Let It Be\\" near the back of the book and found, to my delight, that I could play it cold. (I would, however, recommend keeping a chord reference handy if you do so, because the book pretty much attempts to get you to learn such things as you go and so does not often repeat previously covered material.) Also, the fact that the book has a double spiral-ring binding is an immense convenience, allowing one to lay it flat open on a table or stand. All in all, this may well in fact be what it claims to be... the best Beginner's Songbook ever!
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|Just as good as the first CD!  Includes some songs that I felt were missing from their first CD, including a couple of Jon's fantastic solos.  All of Me and Waterfall are just amazing.  Also some purely &#34;fun&#34; songs, such as the Charlie Brown medley and Happy Together.  (If you haven't seen the youtube video of Happy Together, it's worth a watch!  Steve is hilarious.)  Throw in a great take on Canon in D and a host of other great songs, and you've got a wonderful CD that I highly recommend - everyone in my family will listen to it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! I was first touring Paris! Now I am touring Moscow because I upgraded....If you don't have this ga.e then get it!!!
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book was amazing, i loved the plot and how clay was hurt by how Hannah felt even when he tried to help. Anyway loved it and you should read it

0345525558|4.0|\\"The Language of Flowers\\" was a compelling book.  I couldn't put the book down for the first 3/4 of it.  But that last 1/4, I unfortunately found to be very slow and aggravating, and TOO descriptive, to the point where I just wanted to hurry up and be finished with it.  I think I didn't enjoy it for personal reasons, however.  There might be others (don't want to give away any spoilers) that might be more moved by the these chapters.<br /><br />With that said, I WILL give the book 4 stars.  That first 3/4 of the book was so beautiful, so heartbreakingly honest, and very informational to read.  I feel like I know a lot abou the language of flowers now! I also love that Victoria's flower dictionary is included at the end; I feel like I'll honestly use this guide in the future!!!!!<br /><br />I would definately recommend this book to a friend.
B007BT0RKG|1.0|Useless app. Did. It know how to map from place to place. Needs download of every state, and pests you to buy the pro.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As always My favorite author has written another great book.Love the character followup on Dan Torrence.Could not put the book down for one minute.
B00EDF43MY|2.0|I don't know if my kids are just too old for dr panda (they're 6) or if this one just wasn't their thing, but it got less than 5 minutes total playing time.  It seems like all the other dr panda apps though, so if your kids like those, they'll like this.  We stopped playing pretty quickly so I might be missing the educational part of this, but it seemed like the point was to drag animals into a check-in line, then do very simple shape matching to get a stamp in their passport.  The next activity was to put some coins into a pay phone slot (it displayed a total for what was inserted- but didn't require any counting).<br /><br />There isn't really anything wrong with this app- no violence, sound wasn't annoying, and I didn't see any in-app purchasing.  This would be a good choice for a 3yo who like planes.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|In 1791, a young girl is orphaned when her parents do not survive the voyage from Ireland to Virginia.  The ship's captain promptly indentures her older brother, but decides there's nothing to do with the girl but bring her home with him.  Lavinia is put to work with the slaves in the kitchen house and they soon become her new family.  But there is a huge divide between the girl and the slaves.  She is white, and although a servant, she will eventually be free to make her own way in the world once she is an adult.<br /><br />From the first pages, I loved [[ASIN:1439153663 The Kitchen House: A Novel]]!  It pulls you in and keeps you there - forcing you to abandon everything in your life for want of reading the next page.  The themes of slavery, race, abandonment and the struggle to belong are presented with a gripping storyline that tells us as much about our American past as it forces us to recognize portions of it that still exist today.<br /><br />I thought Grissom did an excellent job researching the area and it's history, but the end was a little too tidy for me.  For many, that won't matter, and honestly, it didn't matter all that much to me either.  Fantastic work of historical fiction and I highly recommend it!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The new update does not work, it doesn't  even open, all it doeses just tells you to force it to close ... if you havent updated it... don't update it!
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|Having been a teenager and young man during this period, I  loved the music. The video was very well done. if you're a fan of R and B, the Stones, Leon Russell, or anyone else whose sound was made complete by being recorded in Muscle Shoals, you will dig this video.
B00DGNO3WE|1.0|Boring.  Sorry but truly boring.  Unfortunate because the story line is interesting.  Still adore Maggie Smith.  She wasn't supported well by her colleagues in this film whose acting was like acting.

B009MYAQOA|5.0|Of course,  I thought I knew about Frank Lloyd Wright.  I am familiar with his work - his fantastic, cutting-edge structures, from the clean-lined homes with stained glass windows, beautiful pieces of mission-style furniture and amazing buildings like the Guggenheim in New York City.  But I had no idea about his personal life whatsoever.<br /><br />In Loving Frank, Nancy Horan examines the life of the architectural genius from the point of view of his mistress, Mamah Borthwick Cheney, who abandons her husband and children to pursue of life of intellectualism, art and love with Frank Lloyd Wright.<br /><br />I was very impressed with this first novel by Nancy Horan.  Growing up in Oak Park, Illinois, she knew of the Wright legend and thus began the idea for her book.  Her research was impressive and her writing style equally so.  She obviously spent a lot of time learning the subject of art, architecture and design, and the excitement Wright must have felt in creating shone through the novel's pages.<br /><br />I have to admit it really got under my skin.  To have the story told from Mamah Cheney's point of view, you hear her arguments for the choices she has made.  Of course, this is supposition on Horan's part, but it is educated supposition.  I, like the general public at the time, did not approve of her choices and it made me a little uncomfortable with the style of writing that invited a relationship with her.  On the other hand, because she was cast out from society because of her illicit relationship with Frank Lloyd Wright, it made me question how I would treat her myself.<br /><br />I was equally amazed at the eccentricities of Wright and the personal history of the couple and their respective families.  I am stunned that I had heard nothing of this before.<br /><br />Finally, I couldn't help but see a similarity between Wright's life and the story behind Ayn Rand's [[ASIN:0452273331 The Fountainhead]].  It made me wonder if she got the idea for her book from Frank Lloyd Wright's genius and the public's backlash against his way of life.m Frank Lloyd Wright's genius and the public's backlash against his way of life.

B0000DJZA5|2.0|To answer my own question:  So McCartney could settle a 30 year old score and try his hand at revisionist history at the same time.  I find this release to be insulting at best. You could piece a comparable album together from what has already been released on Anthology 3.  Countless hours of material from the Let It Be/Get Back sessions have circulated among collectors for years.  So what does Apple do?  They give us a one disc redo of the original album with alternate takes and no new songs. Gee, thanks. Any fan could throw in several wish-list songs they would love to have released from these sessions.  Mine would be the unreleased Lennon song Watching Rainbows.  Fat chance of that ever happening.  This CD would be easier to swallow if only they had released the Let It Be film along with it.  The movie has been out of print since the early 80's.  How hard would it have been to give us a bare bones DVD about 10 years ago?
B001RHPJBU|5.0|This CD has all of his best hits I didnt own any of his past songs so this was a steal to me
B00BD07SGU|4.0|If not for one thing, Amorphis is one of the most consistent band that I know of. The only downfall is I wish they would take more chances (like the disco section in Magic And Mayhem and Cares) or the revamped acoustic Empty Opening and other songs they played in new arrangements a few years back (really wish that would get released officially). However, this album is still amazing. It took 8 months to grow on me as oddly enough every Amorphis album has. The first few months of listening to it, I thought it was terrible but then it all clicked like it happened every other time. The 1-2-3 punch of Amorphis' melodic side with Mission, The Wanderer and Narrow Path is an amazing run but don't be fooled into thinking there are no heavy moments on the album. While most people are salivating over Nightbirds Song (hasn't clicked all the way yet), the one that floored me is the brutality of Enchanted By The Moon. Doomy, sludgy, heavy. Couldn't ask for anything better. One thing that has changed is Tomi Joutsen is utilizing some more death like vocals as opposed to the standard growls.....gives an interested effect. Good stuff!

B004G5ZY7E|4.0|Joe Nesbo is a great mystery writer.  This book is another case for Harry Hole to solve - a snowman is the murderer's calling card.  It takes place in Norway, and Nesbo keeps you guessing as to who the real killer is.  Hole continues to fight his alcoholism in this book.  It's great to go through all of his thought processes to see how he finally figures out who the killer is.

B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|When I saw The Hobbit in theater last year I was happy but not blown away.  As I thought about it I realized...this is not LOR.  Different story...different movie.  Not the same feel as LOR.  I got the dvd because, as a 40+ year fan, I knew I would have to watch Hobbit many, many times to &#34;get it&#34;.  It has to stand on its own and I think it does.  At some point The Silmarillion has to come to screen.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Lost in this series!! Soooo good I can't get enough so sad to know it's almost over!! Wish they would keep going. Not really looking forward to the movies but at least I will get .more!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Who would have thought with this story line that you could not wait for the next episode to begin.  I've just started on season three and I'm hooked!!!
B0037YOMWS|5.0|Excellent Calculator.. does everything i use it for..<br />which really isn't much..but i like the fact that &#34;it can&#34;<br />if i need it to.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Season 1 was the bait.  Season 2 is the HOOK !!!!!  It is very difficult not to sit and watch Episodes non-stop.  I am trying to watch one a week but it is very tough.  The storyline and scripts and acting...all too much to turn off.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|love it really fun and you can play it with somebody else if you have more that one device. I would probably tell the developer to add bosses to the game... for example a gorilla or orangutan every now and then would be cool ... and other moves, also combo moves if possible : )
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fun & borderline addictive. I didn't think id enjoy bingo but surprisingly I did. It is Such a great game.
B0081336FO|5.0|I  have enjoyed seasons one and two and am waiting with excitement for season three !!!! The storylines have been all very interesting and both actors bring uniquely quirky and unusual layers of intrigue and humour to their characters
0877180121|5.0|great teaching tool for piano beginners -<br /> I am enjoying teaching my granddaughter her first lessons on a piano .<br />thanks
006224454X|5.0|This is a novel that is subtle in the way it's written.  I was intrigued by the plot and it really held me- simple ordinary things going on but in the back of your mind you wonder... a good read with an ending that I didn't predict...
B000G6R7B8|5.0|Absolutely phenomanal watch.  I would recommend to anyone who wants a quality Seiko sport watch.  I has a wonderful price also.
B00DC3DGSK|4.0|Good CD . I liked that Buddy had guests performing with him . I definately recomend this CD to anyone who likes the Blues .
B0012GTZFC|5.0|It is a great book. Lots of insight. It is clearly arranged and easy thoughts counts. Very good to discuss with your friends what they personally have read and understood this as a book. The discussion yet finds useful things for yourself.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|What month is it now...October2013? Yep!!!!! I have watched a lot of movies at least one every week, and guess what, This is by far still the best movie of the year. Too bad, this is the last Ironman movie. We can on catch Robert Downey  Jr. in 2015 Avengers: Age of Ultron and 2017 Avengers 3.
B00E9P959O|5.0|Great work on the remix.  One could always tell that there was a great set of songs in the original but it was exhausting to try and listen for them.  Now all is very well balanced and the songs really shine as the highly emotive compositions they truly are. Like getting a brand new album!<br /><br />As much as I enjoy Clockwork Angels, I think the mix on the new Vapor Trails is better. Clockwork Angels is frequently overly dense and muddy sonically. (To my ears anyway...)
B00FEHXISA|4.0|At least Robert Downy Jr was not as cocky in this one.  I liked the action and it kept me entertained for 2 hours. Of all the Iron Man movies, I loved Iron Man the first one the best.  This was good but not great.  If there was another, I would watch it too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The first book of the Suzanne Collins series about how each district must give up a male and female to fight for the right to win to the death to reign as the years winners to commemorate the insurrection against the systems government (Panem). The beginning where Katniss volunteers for the first time in the Hunger Games to take her sisters place.
B000G03S94|3.0|Love MUSE, LOVE them. This is the first Vinyl format that I have bought, and it's flimsy, thin vinyl that doesn't seem to have as much sonic quality as I would have hoped.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I found this game to be a nice challenge! Enjoyed it a great deal!<br />Very stimulating to sharpen your skills of friction and solution solving!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm hooked on this TV series... it's so nice to watch a quality television show instead of the &#34;reality tv&#34; that is so popular today.  It's interesting to go back in time and think of how things used to be.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I love the way that they updated the series and Chris Pine as Kirk.  Couldn't wait to see what they did for Khan.  Bravo Zulu!  I l<br />Can hardly wait for the next movie, because there has to be one.<br />Alice
B003O86FMW|5.0|Second book of the Suzanne Collins trilogy of Hunger Games. The story only builds from the first and gets better as Katniss becomes the center in the fight against the system.
1439170045|4.0|This is a very poignant and personal description of someone being able to observe her own struggle with early-onset alzheimer's.
B0094LNSYG|5.0|This movie blew me away when it first came out, and it still does. The casting, acting, plot and the look of the movie make it one of the top science fiction classics, in my book. Although I confess a preference for the narration that was added to the original theatrical release -- I thought it added a film noir overtone that I liked -- this version looks and sounds better than I remember. If you love the movie, you probably have at least one of the versions that have come out. I wanted this on my Kindle Fire, hence the recent purchase. I still marvel at it when I watch.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a pretty fun game once you get the hang of it!  My kids love it too!  I see hours of entertainment and wasted time ahead of us!
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Based loosely on the book, but it had Brad Pitt and the fastest Zombies in the world.  I read the book when I heard about the movie coming out and it was not what I expected.  Glad that the movie had creative differences.<br />Alice
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The third and final book that Suzanne Collins penned to show and build up the final conflict of the all of the districts uniting in the destruction of the government system (Panem). Katniss becomes the focal point of leading the districts as the figurehead/leader to end the governments rule and rid the government of the Hunger Games.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved the trilogy.  I can't remember  when I enjoyed a  story this much.  I need more E.L. James - much more.<br />,
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game it creeps me thinking this game is the best I hope every one I like your game because they should because it is fun
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|This film was for me the best Iron Man so far. The characters have matured and face grown-up relationship problems. Tony Stark learns humility. It is action packed and smart. A better title could have been...Your Past Will Haunt You.<br /><br />Without giving away too much Tony Stark grows up! The movie is well worth the watching. If you are a real fan like me it is well worth the purchasing too.
B009FB3XTA|4.0|Some of the music is not to my liking, but overall the CD is great. I am a collector, so it was more for my collection than for anything.
B00BSZZA3I|5.0|I have had many cell phone cases but I really love this. My H TC fits perfect I am able to watch movies and listen to my music that in me proud love it
0525478817|5.0|Great author loved the book it's amazing !!! Very emotional , read the book on about 3 pick ups love it
B007SYWFRM|1.0|This game is a rip off. Don't let your kids play this!! It won't load any way. It says to update then it goes back to apps then back to game.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|When a person wants to know what love is like all they have to do is open a Nickolas Sparks romance novel like Dear John and all his other creations like The Notebook and Message in a Bottle to discover  love as no other modern writer inscribed it from the raw emotions and tenderness which you feel in real life.
B008DM4OTA|4.0|Always goes back to the green screen with the logo and stays there for too long. Can't get the items to move freely no matter how we tap the screen. A great concept and should be fun but is so frustrating we just shut it down and go to better designed games or puzzles we've downloaded. We should have stuck with free version.<br />Expected better than this.<br /><br />CHANGED REVIEW 2/20/14<br />My 4-year old granddaughter seems to have figured out this game 100%<br />better than I. She really gets engrossed in it and is so delighted when she \\"heals\\" some character who has dental, stomach or eye problems. I still won't go to 5 stars because I don't like the time it takes to keep going to that green screen.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you ever read The Shining, this is a must read! Stephen King is a master storyteller, and I look forward to his next book.
159514188X|2.0|I thought this book was going to be such a good read but her reasons why she killed herself where stupid
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The setup was super easy and fast. Watching youtube on large screen became my primary source of entertainment in the living room.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I have not completed the book, however I found the beginning of the story very typical and somewhat slow reading.  It does not hold my interest long enough to sit and just want to continue reading.  I hope the ending of the story was worth the time it takes to read a book.
1444737112|5.0|Great book, story belongs with many others including &#34;Racing in the Rain, etc. Wonderful recounting of a person that needed to connect, cat was the connection
0553593714|2.0|There's a part in a book where it describes Jon Snow had food in his bag, and went on to describe all the items of food (biscuit, cheese, and apple), and then it went on to describe which piece of food he ate first and last (the apple last !).<br /><br />These details had absolutely nothing to do with the story lines. The book is full of meaningless details like the above.<br /><br />I can see some fantasy geeks drooling over those details because \\"these details create the world\\" or whatever, but at the end of the day, they all seem like the author's narcissistic arbitrary conjuring-ups, which all have nothing to do with any kind of the consistent story making, speaking of which (story-making) really has little to nothing in this entire, long, long book.<br /><br />Despite of millions of accolades, I must say I have millions of other, better ways of spending my time than reading these huge books that seem to go nowhere.
B00BB8Q13A|5.0|So THAT's how Shakespeare wrote all those works.  Inspiration!  With the help of a muse.  I will always have this movie--it's a great love story.  No way you'll be disappointed over this.  Sure it's fictional--but that's what Shakespeare did.
B00AESN8XY|1.0|I got this because I thought it was the full version but when I opened it, it turned out to be the trial version. I already had the trial version and I got this because it was cheap and it said it was the full version! If you're looking for full version go to Google play or something. I got the trial version for FREE in Google play so go there before you come to Amazon!
B00006RAKP|4.0|This is more of an Elton John anthology than greatest hits.  Some of the songs I heard for the first time and found tedious.  Don't get me wrong it was a great collection but i was only interested in the more popular songs.
B008742O32|5.0|I use this app all the time on a variety of Android devices.  The UI that runs in your browser is top notch!<br />I just wish it supported root file operations.
B007SGM084|5.0|What can you say about this book and write.  It was a great and sinful read.  Enjoyed every bit of it.  Hopefully, the EL will come back with another sequel to this book.  I am waiting in the wings!!1
B000FCKC4C|3.0|Perhaps this book is more compelling when you're on the front end of your spiritual path, and the topics introduced in this book are fresh, new and revolutionary to you. But I found it to be a lot of yeah, yeah, I learned that bit of wisdom years ago, coupled with a rather dry, slow-paced plot. If it wasn't the monthly selection for my book club, I wouldn't have finished it.
B00A285OOW|4.0|A very wonderful book, I couldn't put it down.  I was never interested in the history of English royalty, but now through this book I want to learn more.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|I love the Bee Gees.  I bought this CD for a road trip and it is now loaded in my car CD player as a permanent addition.<br />Music is uplifting and the tempo was great for long x-country drive.<br /><br />A great addition for ant Bee Gees fans.
0689829590|3.0|The book is cool.  Some of the pages fold out into bigger pictures but be careful when you unfold them out because when I did it, I stressed the folds of the book which caused some rips/tears in the folds of the pages.
B0038Z5SEW|5.0|One of my favorite movies. Baldwin & Hopkins make a great team in a great adventure movie. I just bought it in blue ray which brings the  story even more believable..
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|wow, this movie was a trip i'm still figuring out stuff so many layers, say what you will about tom cruise the man can act.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|When I began this book I didn't realize it was a continuation of The Shining. I was pleasantly surprised. I read all of Stephen King 's books. I enjoyed this more than any I have read in a long time. I won't get into the story. I will just say that, if you are a fan, you will love this book!
B003Y5H5FG|1.0|Cannot believe Collin Farrell made this movie.  It was so cheap and shallow.  I would call it a D movie at best.
B00DJYKFXG|1.0|My wife and I first heard about this set in Rolling Stone magazine.  It was touted as 4 CD's and a DVD.  We are big music DVD fans and could not be more disappointed in what we received.  The CD's were great.  The DVD from 1971 we thought we were getting turned out to be only 2 live performances.  The other 25 songs are live still camera shots!!!  What a rip off.  It was a total deception and we feel violated.  If you read Levon Helm's book This Wheel's on Fire, you will get a pretty good perspective of Robbie Robertson's greed. This is the latest version of it.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Terrific acting, great script. Beats anything on American television by a mile. Olivia Colman is great at drama and comedy (Rev).
B004KABEZG|5.0|I teach animation and I recommend that every student add this book to their personal library. Faigin provides just the right blend of anatomy (how the face moves) and psychology (how the emotions animate the face). His examples are clear and lucid, drawing from fine-art painting and sculpture to court room photographs. The kindle version works better than I thought it would.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Can't stop! This show has it all. I have to force myself to stop watching and go to sleep. Awesome!
B00B9E29CI|1.0|A lot of storytelling and no substance. Boring . Not digging into the most important message ,character.<br />Can i get a refund
B0013USZHG|3.0|I enjoy listening to track #4 - it is a masterpiece, but tracks 6 and 7 are impossible to listen , since the quality of the C.D. is bad.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A very wonderful story about bullying but also life.  Being told through the eyes of many brought out different perspectives and brought out the point that you never know what's going on in someone else's head.  My son is reading this for school which is why I read it, but I would recommend it to anyone, school age and older.  For my son and I, it has sparked numerous conversations about how people are treated and how we treat them.<br /><br />Wonder is wonderful!
B001ATN3QS|5.0|This western makes my top 10 all time movies list. Soundtrack, actor lineup, classic western imagery, and the classic elements of the storyline make this a must-see movie. It is an exploration of good and evil, morality, and the bounds of friendship and honor. Underneath the Hollywood, some really moving illumination of the human condition and the heroic archetype are on display.
B008133MDK|5.0|I didn't watch Sherlock when it originally came out.  I found it on Netflix after both seasons were already completed and decided to give it a try.  Boy, was I missing out.  Sherlock is easily one of the top 5 shows I have ever watched.  The first season was amazing and the second season just kept up the good work, possibly even outshining the first.  If you haven't checked this show out, stop what you are doing and watch it immediately.  The only downside is how addicting it is.  Once you watch one episode you won't want to stop until there are none left.  And then when you have finished all of the episodes, you will want to watch them all over again.  I simply cannot wait for season 3 to come out.  Get your addiction started now.  It will be the best thing to ever happen to you.
B00DXP7L88|1.0|If you stopped watching Dexter after season 4, you a one of the most brilliant people on the planet with amazing foresight. Because the show continued to go downhill at a steady speed ever since and as fantastic as the Breaking Bad finale was, that's how horribly stupid and contrived the ending of Dexter was. I cannot fathom why the writers did this to their show.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|It makes time go quickly.  I always wish I had more time. I find myself waiting impatiently, and thrilled when the energy is  full. I recommend it to anyone with a little spare time.
B005AERS74|4.0|Fun to listen too, I enjoy it, upbeat, catchy, added it to my maroon 5 collection, would guess most fans will like this the same as all other CDs
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse is the best that I have ever used. it has a nice design and shape to it that makes you hand comfortably rest on it. Also the programmable buttons on the mouse make it easier for you to play games or just make it so that you can move around your computer easier. This mouse was and is a great buy. I highly suggest it to anyone.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Hey, it's nice to know what seaweed brain is doing. He has even more seaweed now I think maybe, the seaweed brain be is
B00AQIZRLS|4.0|My 4 year old could spend a lot of time playing this game.  He really enjoys finding all the hidden pictures.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|This could explain the terrist acts of today.  Everyone wants revenge. Hurt is hard to let go off.  the pain will not leave till revenge is taken on the person that did the hurting.  A must see.  The movie was make years ago but is relevant today.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I use this on most of my pictures. I highly recommend this app!! I have this app installed on all of my mobile devices!!
B00BRUQ3PS|3.0|Not as good as the first two books in the series, but not a bad read. There is not as much detail and thought put into this book.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I had not gotten to watch the show on television until lately and thought, OMG!!!...<br />These guy a so very funny. They a great and nerdy.<br />Once you watch them U R hooked on the show.<br />I have purchased all 6 seasons, because my family loves the comedy.<br />Thanks
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This is an amazing book. Potentially life changing. If you've struggled with your weight for years like I have and have felt the guilt of having poor self-control and slothfulness, then you HAVE to read this book. It's not your fault. Seriously, it's NOT YOUR FAULT!!<br /><br />This book has radically changed the way I eat and I have already lost 9 lbs in less than 30 days just by making some adjustments to my eating habits. It's not a diet, it's not a fad, it's a revelation.<br /><br />This is a MUST READ book.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|If there were an extra star I'd give it to this show. Great storyline! There isn't a show like this on the air.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|I can't get back in. My mom lost all her neighbors and says expansions and tasks are still too expensive. dino world not loading properly for her as well. I hope when bug is fixed we get free acorns expansions or animals
B0053O89WY|5.0|We have purchased all 6 seasons,  because our family loves<br />watching the DVD's without having the television commercials.<br />So with season 7 on television, Yelp...we deal with the commercials.<br />Tanks
B008NMT684|5.0|This is a very cool game, easy to navigate and puzzle pieces lock into place when correct one is close. Very good game for toddlers.
B001NXBRJG|5.0|That this movie is amazing? The booklet attached to it was the reason I bought this magnificent work of art.<br />Now,you have 2 options. If you chose the red pill you will will go deep down the rabbit hole for ignoring this 10th anniversary reissue and live a life of misery. If you chose the blue pill and buy this, you live in bliss eternally. Your call.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is the first FlipPix Art puzzle that I have played and I am enjoying it very much. The 5x5 grids are easy enough that they are not frustrating. The 10x10 become a bit more challenging. I definitely recommend.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|The game is still fun...if you're patient.  The ads are annoying but you cm skip them after a few seconds.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|This is a very cool game, easy to navigate and puzzle pieces lock into place when correct one is close. Very good game for toddlers.
B0053O89XI|5.0|What else can you expect from BBT? I love it just as much as every other season I've purchased. It's great!
B007SGM084|5.0|Really a great book regardless of the  theme most people choose to focus.<br />Couldn't stop reading...read all three books in a week.
B004BCT2HU|5.0|David Garrett's music is a great cross-over. He is not only a virtuoso when it comes to classical pieces, but also a rock star!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Great movie!! Watch original again.  It was really cool to see what happened prior to the wrath of Kahn. I would recommend that the young people who never saw the original series to watch them since they all relate some how.
B00E3D7WGU|5.0|This has become my Workout cd. Full of live remixes you can get you twerking on to. Love Love Love it
B009O07NMA|5.0|Enjoyable music.  All the songs are catchy and wonderful to listen to.  I love the distinct sound these boys have, remind me of Rascal Flatts but with a little more edge.
B000002OOY|5.0|Williams writes the most amazing movie scores! I will continue to purchase his music, and hope that he will compose for many years to come.
B005HSL626|5.0|Begged my Grandma to get this game it is so fun I urge you to get this game.If you are still wondering about this game check the other reviews
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I thought chromecast would be good for travel to watch netflix etc in a hotel room. Nope.<br />Apparently public networks are typically configured to stop two devices from talking to each other (\\"AP isolation\\", I think).<br />Another reason why I wish that chromecast was really just a receiver for whatever is on my iphone screen (i.e. a wireless hdmi cable for my iphone). Sigh.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|This man just makes me smile with his antics on the Voice and his songs on the CD.  Just a truly enjoyable album.
0345525558|5.0|This story was a beauty. I felt like I was in a dream reading it. The characters were believable and real. The story was full of emotional and dramatic turning points. I wish it never ended. It was a feel-good read and I am so glad I came across this story in a chance encounter. I will buy a copy for my friends so I won't ever risk losing my copy :-)
B0033H7VI6|5.0|You can not beat this knife for the price.  This is a very well built full tang knife.  You will never break this knife with it's amazing thickness,  you can even do fine carving with this very stought and robust knife
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Great reading! Good advice to be rooted and grounded in what you believe. Very challenging! Great job. A must read.
B000VUCIZE|5.0|Simple, to the point, eye opening, disheartening to think how America is going, hopeful, hopeless, factual, brave, frightening, too short.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This is one of the Best Pictures I've ever seen!!! And it's a musical, it's great, I love it from begin to end, all songs are wonderfull, the movie makes you cry, laugh, breathless times, all states of the human soul are reached by this amazing work.<br />I'm a big fan of the Victor Hugo &#34;Les Miserables&#34; novel, I had read some years ago, and instantly turns my favorite, my number one of novels.<br />I like the movie which stars Liam Neeson in 1998, but this is better, more complete and reachs more aspects of the work of Victor Hugo although nothing compares to read it.<br />IT deserves the OSCAR to the BEST picture, a story from the mankind for the mankind.<br />I'm from Uruguay, sorry for any mistake in my english, and thanks to the actors, producers, and all the people who works for bring us this. THANKS!!!
B00005M91K|5.0|People should realize that when this film came out it was groundbreaking for its cinematography and unbelievable imagery and depth of feeling that was conveyed.<br /><br />It was a tour de force of culture and nature from around the world, complete with a breathtaking score.<br /><br />My kids were quite mesmerized by it, and it prompted some great discussions about global cultures.
B00004Z400|5.0|Expanding into melodic and funky realms.  Digital Bath is my favorite and stands out.  A must for all Deftones fans.
B00FEN000S|5.0|Gotta say, I didn't know what to expect from this movie. I was intrigued by the trailer, and I'm so glad i decided to watch it. Very unique storyline in that the &#34;heroes&#34; are actually normal men and women who are piloting these huge robots. I liked that the characters are flawed, as we all are, and yet they have big hearts, great courage, and a desire to help beat the bad guys. If you like sci-fi, I think you will really like this movie.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|Same excitement. Different, interesting plot. Jack and his old team from the Army make up for the loss of murdered buddies.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was recommended to me and I recommended to my book club and we all enjoyed it and enjoyed a good discussion.  I consider this my new favorite read, my husband surprised me coming home early from up north and found me sobbing like a little kid with snot and everything.
B007MAETA8|4.0|I came across the saw the video on making the cover artwork and decided to buy the disc. Nicely done and interesting.  Nothing grabs me.
B003F9G8B8|5.0|I always love when movies such as this can be so fun to watch and still educational--a great way to learn history!
B00F8H0LM2|2.0|I don't like the constant sales pitch commercials<br />I don't like the game<br />this one is not good at all
B00AEFYCL4|5.0|Love this movie especially the soundtrack! Some inappropriate scenes that may make you blush if you watch with a 12 year old son. I would rate it a PG13
B000002NIW|5.0|Early offering by this unique, rocking band. I have found Deftones to grow on me like warm fuzz and have become a fan.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is pure enjoyment. It can be a quick diversion or hours of logic solving recreation. Well worth the price.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Full length commercials are run between levels...<br />otherwise it's the same fun game that began this madness<br />but the ads... OH the ADS...  I specifically DO NOT BUY THOSE PRODUCTS
B005HI4LMS|5.0|This movie is one crazy movie.  I loved it...I couldn't stop laughing.  It's very stupid humor but if you like that you'll love this movie.
B00000273M|5.0|Yes, this is one of my favorites for the 80s along with Lionel Richie and Kenny Loggins.  Good buy.  All good.
B00BHNR1KQ|3.0|I was a little disappointed, but I don't regret the time I spent watching it. Not as scarey as I would have thought by the trailersI I thought some things were dijointed and went unexplained.
B00DW5IM9Q|4.0|Great insight to a transitional time for Bob.  A little bit of folk, some country, a little rock n roll.  Some of the alternate takes work, but not all.  I highly recommend buying it.
B00594XOZU|1.0|The worst app ever. I just downloaded it and no matter how many times I delete it and refresh it, it never lets me sign up or log in... FIX IT OR I WILL CUT AS H TH ED CREATORS
B009PK9SB8|3.0|This camera is awesome when working right.  It is so tiny it is difficult to read the text on the settings.  The videos take up phenomenal amount of space on your computer. Huge, HUGE files. You must be prepared for that.  There are SO many small parts to this little camera, I'm always paranoid I'm going to lose something.<br /><br />But, when all parts are assembled and camera is working right, it does take kick-ass great videos. I especially love the fish eye wide angle shots.  Fantastic.  I've used this with the suction up attached to car windows - that works well - especially when the remote is working well with the camera.  That is the best. To sit in the car and click that remote to capture wide angle shots of the scenery and click it off when scenery has passed.<br /><br />Batteries don't last long, so you want to make sure you purchase one or two extra batteries.<br /><br />You will also want to get the GoPro Case to keep all those small parts together in once place.<br /><br />A friend of mine purchased a Go Pro the same time I did. She returned his - it was defective. Mine is not defective, it is just, well, temperamental.  I plan on taking this little guy with me to Cancun next year to wear while I ride the dolphins.  I
193700788X|1.0|In the beginning, I could not wait for the next installment of the Southern Vampires/Sookie Stackhouse. In the beginning, I was all Bill, and I thought the series was going to focus around Bill and Sookie.  Bill was the man, or so I thought, and then in comes Eric and what a character he was.  I say was because the Eric in this last book, is not the Eric of old.  He was all power and very male and he had his eyes on Sookie.  Ms. Harris built him up so much that we needed an Eric fix before the next book would come out.  I would re-read the books until the next book was released. All through the books, it was Eric always there protecting Sookie from danger and looking out for her.  Then, in about book 10, things started changing and slowly leading us away from Eric, which I absolutely did not like.  I spent all those years wrapped around Sookie and Erie to see the writing down the road in this book!!!!!  These books were basically centered around the powerful Vampire Eric and Sookie but something told me that Ms. Harris would not allow Sookie to end up with a Vampire because of what they are....undead.  Ms. Harris seemed to forget that these books were about Sookie and Eric and not about Ms. Harris' feelings about the undead. Eric and Sookie's chemistry was magical.  And then Ms. Harris had to blow that out of the water and by this last book, because she ruined the relationship between Eric and Sookie, the book lost all passion, lost all emotions and simply seemed thrown together.  She took the very essence out of the book by doing that.  To me, she had Sookie and Eric together just to get money out of the fans who loved the couple together, as Eric was a real character.  All along, Ms. Harris stated that she knew the ending, yet milked us for all of its worth knowing that we all wanted Eric and Sookie to be together.  After her last book before this one, I certainly was not disappointed in this ending-series finale.  She angered me two books from the end when it waswritten on the walls that Eric and Sookie would not be together.  Luckily, I did not buy this book but borrowed it from someone else who was going to burn it.  I read it first (it took awhile) and then we burned the last three books together. What a fire. I am disappointed in what Ms. Harris has done to her fans. There are so many other Vampire books out there and other \\"Other\\" books that I certainly will not read another one written by Ms. Harris.  Shame on her in what she has done to the characters and took away the very essence of the characters of old.  When True Blood came out it seemed that things started changing for the worse.  I guess one can tell that I CANNOT recommend someone to waste either their valuable time and/or money in reading and/or buying this book.  What a bunch of wasted years. A good author is not supposed to disappoint so many fans but that she did in her writing of the characters and Sookie's HEA!  Thanks a lot Ms. Harris!!  This book does not even deserve one star.
B001B7CNY2|5.0|Excellent movie! Great sound! Great visuals for an older movie! Depth charges and explosions will rattle your walls! Highly recommended!
B00C7607FS|3.0|Ok, I'm a huge Little Mermaid fan, and this dvd was kind of disappointing. The colors were fantastic, but its the volume of the songs. During some of the songs, the music was louder then the vocals. Thankfully it only happened once, but it was disappointing to hear that. The also changed some parts of the movie (the preacher incident, and the wedding dress are some).<br /><br />I'm glad that I purchased it, but it if came out in theaters first, i would not have bough this dvd for myself.
B000062YAZ|3.0|not there best work. but still worth buying.Rain in blood is the best song on this CD. Old school Slayer is the best
B00B4804KS|5.0|I love the movie, but the 3D is terrible, even with the glasses You still get  double image and if you use subtitles forget it you can't read them. I don't get it, I bought Titanic in 3d and it was perfect. waste of money on this one, I was going to buy House of Wax, but I'll take a pass.

B007N6ZH5M|5.0|While many economists have gone to town lambasting Ruchir Sharma for what they term a shallow and incomplete analysis, I think this book is all about anecdotes and impressions, very much along the lines of Michael Lewis' Boomerang. Not that the 2 books are about the same subject, but the approach is the same.<br /><br />It is the process of using anecdotes and stories to identify trends. Often with information/ data overwhelming us, the ability does not exist for us to make a completely informed analysis since the information is at its very core overwhelming with oodles of embedded noise.<br /><br />What I like about Ruchir's book is story like approach to the analysis and opening our eyes up to certain realities. One may not agree with the outcome of his analysis, but that shouldn't prevent one from liking it and appreciating the effort. Trouble is, most readers like to commend what they agree with and trash what does not conform to their view of the world.<br /><br />Thanks Ruchir, what I would say is a commendable effort!

1439156816|5.0|I loved this book.  Even though I'm not a fan of Stephen King's novels -- I really don't like horror -- he is clearly a wonderful writer!  I have bought half a dozen books on writing fiction, and they were helpful, but King's book is the best I've read on the subject.  He gives solid advice as well as encouragement and disputes all the books that list &#34;rules&#34; for writing.  He doesn't believe in &#34;rules&#34;, except for the common sense advice that punctuation, spelling and sentence structure do matter.  Since he formerly taught English, that's to be expected.  But I agree with him.  Every writer is different, so all the other touted &#34;rules&#34; really aren't valid.  His point of view is far more down to earth than that of most of the writers of  books on writing.  His advice is excellent.  The autobiographical information he included in this book is also fascinating.  Although not a fan of horror, I am definitely a fan of Stephen King.  This is a book worth reading, for both writers and non-writers.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Exactly what I've come to expect from Nicholas Sparks - an interesting, entertaining story.  I always prefer happy endings but the ending held true to the story line and upheld the integrity of the story.

B00F91SCXC|4.0|Brad Pitt is so dreamy. The movie effectively built up the anxiety of how they would address the zombie crisis but then the solution was just unimpressive. But how creative can you get in solving a zombie epidemic? It was a better idea than anything I would have suggested. Overall, just a fun move to watch!

B00F7YHDWC|4.0|I love the game so far and I am able to get past the plane and 4 hole moose death on my kindle fire hd 7&quot;. Just wanted to let those with this model to know. I was able to blow on the screen where the plane was and advance to th  next level. The trick with the moose death is to use one finger at a time while still keeping your finger on the ones you covered up. After a bit of playing the screen went black though but, it was still running. I got it back up by going to home screen and restarting the app. The  board with th  balloons was also blacked out an  could only see balloons and the thing on the  left. 5 stars if they can fix that.

B00E6D4HHO|4.0|I don't see why people would get bent out of shape thinking this movie is already outdated....of course it's already out dated, even if you add days of future past, it'd still be out of date.  You really think they're done making x-men movies?
B00A287PG2|5.0|A great book on how the business of consulting developed. A must read on developing, growing and maintaining a business and what happens when you don't stick to your business plan.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I gave Me before You five stars because it was a story I wanted to hear about and it kept my interest until the very end. While sad, the theme is relevant and the characters were well developed and the writing was smooth.  I wasn't sure where it would take me but enjoyed the ride.
1439190976|5.0|This is a fascinating book about McKinsey, iff you are interesting in the management consulting industry. It will mostly be interesting to people that have lived through the last two decades or more. I don't think it is very interesting reading for potential new recruits. The book also contains relevant part of the older history, but the book is certainly not dull history.<br /><br />The author concludes that McKinsey is good at client relationships and not client projects. That is a very harsh assessment; basically stating that the firm recycle knowledge and suck up to the individual managers that hire them.<br /><br />In some respects I think the author is overstating his case. For instance he makes a point of McKinsey starting to take payment in terms of equity stakes. However, the argument falls quite flat when he notes it is only 2% of the firms revenue. Still, overall I think the book is a relatively fair description of the company. It is clear that the author does not like Gupta, the managing director during the 1990s and early 2000s.<br /><br />The book is very engaging and written in a breezy style. I particularly like that he is also throwing some dirt - makes the book more fun to read. We get to know some inside stories behind Foster's book on innovation or how the firm has ensnared the British government as a client. Depending on your preferences, this will either increase or decrease your interest in the book.<br /><br />There seems to be a lot of power struggles behind the scenes. This makes me wonder about the objectivity of the information. I am sure the author is onto something important, but it is not clear whether the details are correct or just attempts by individuals to trash the people that they do not like.<br /><br />Interesting content, sometimes a bit weak because hard to find data, but an delight to read. It is the over-dog that is being critiqued and if some statements are wrong it is up to the over-dog to clarify. I give the book five stars.ars.
B005LAIII0|5.0|My wife and I watched this film in HD on a premium channel one evening and were impressed by the stunning beauty of the production in general, so we decided to purchase the Blu-ray edition to fully demonstrate the intense colors and details. We weren't disappointed. In addition, the Blu-ray includes several special features which the DVD does not. The technical eye will perceive some effects which are clearly CGI (the motion of the lifeboat in rough seas is unnatural and the lack of the boat listing when the 300 lb tiger is way to one side of the craft), but these are minor flaws. The story itself concludes cleverly with the viewer to make his/her own decision. In general, a keeper to add to ones collection.

Adore Spock, Uhura and their surprising relationship which was never known about in the original.  anyway, this 2nd movie installment has everything I liked in the first movie, however it seemed to get a little &#34;talky and mundane&#34; in scenes with Khan.  this is why the 3 stars were given.  it remained action-packed and humorous when called upon. will watch it again and hope this updated version continues..
0061766089|4.0|As a designer and graduate school instructor of \\"Design Thinking,\\" I was excited when a copy of \\"Change By Design\\" first came into my hands - and anxious to see how the content about changes in the way we think about design had been expressed through the design of the book. To my genuine surprise and disappointment, the book is an entirely conventional design. Why would a book on the changes in how we think about design not be reflected visually? The book's design betrays its ground-breaking concepts by framing it in conventional layouts and entirely overlooking the potential for structuring the content so that the concepts are amplified. Why skip innovative book design in a book that teaches design innovation?! Surely this couldn't have been the author's choice. Maybe Harper Business was too conservative a publisher for this book. The design of this book was a missed opportunity for a talented book designer who could've implemented Design Thinking into its structure and layouts.<br /><br />From the perspective of someone who cares about book design because I AM a book designer, I'd like to note a some specific problems:<br /><br />(1) The sideways page numbers. These make it awkward to traverse this book in search of specific pages. Was this possibly the author's artistic rebellion against his editor's insistence on a standard table of contents? If so, it certainly didn't give enough consideration to the reader - a disregard of one of the most important principles in Design Thinking: elegance of user experience.<br /><br />(2) The Mind Map on the inside front cover. The author writes in his introduction that his editor asked him to write a table of contents - our author complied, yet stated his preference for the Mind Map as the reader's guide through the book's content. Good idea! But again, the users weren't fully considered here. Many people (students, for instance... and design teachers like myself) may check this book out of a library, and all library books have cellophane and paper covers, which are tacked onto the inner front and back covers with glue - in effect, covering up half the Mind Map. I tried to gently peel mine back so that I could see it, but it was impossible without stripping the ink from the Mind Map. This was disappointing. I would've appreciated being able to see the author's visual breakdown of the book's content.<br /><br />Tim Brown, your insights and inspirations are much appreciated by designers/educators like myself who are incredibly glad to have a book on the topic of Design Thinking. I personally hope that you'll exert some innovative influence over the book design itself in its 2nd edition!

B00ESY7QXI|5.0|As a fan of the book as well as of DeCaprio's, this is undeniably the Gatsby adaptation I've been waiting for.<br /><br />First, the set: Much attention is paid to small but important details, such as the glowing green light at the dock and the faded oculist's sign.  The splendor of Gatsby's mansion is recreated exquisitely, and the \\"valley of ashes\\" doesn't disappoint in its ghastly wasteland.<br /><br />Second, Luhrmann doesn't depart from the story too much, though I think there was a lot more discourse between Gatsby and Daisy than I remember reading in the book.  He may have changed some of the dialogue, but he does stay unflinchingly true to the spirit of the book and its morals, which I think is vastly more important.<br /><br />Third, the casting was perfect, and probably the most telling detail about Luhrmann's good judgment in making this film- DeCaprio is the embodiment of Gatsby--the smile, the charm, the mannerisms are all what one reading the book would expect him to be like.  Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway was also a great pick -- he has the 'outsider' qualities required for the role of the narrator.  Debicki as Jordan Baker was also very well-cast; she had the aloof coolness and the slightly-bored gaze I pictured when I read the novel.  Daisy, by far, was the most crucial casting in my opinion, because if played too obnoxiously and over-the-top, the whole story falls flat.  However, Carey Mulligan makes her flighty and airy but also lets her show real emotion.  In a way, though her character does horrible things in the movie, you can't help but feel that she isn't completely devoid of thought/emotion.  And of course, her husband Tom, makes the antagonist as a macho-man whose emotions occasionally seep through to the surface.<br /><br />Honestly, with all the good things this movie had going for it, the anachronistic music surprisingly didn't bother me one bit.  It was also clever how jazz motifs were mixed in with hip-hop and rap beats, somehow making the sound swirl into an unidentifiable, chaotic experience.<br /><br />Overall, this was a phenomenal adaptation and definitely a must for any Gatsby fan.g the sound swirl into an unidentifiable, chaotic experience.<br /><br />Overall, this was a phenomenal adaptation and definitely a must for any Gatsby fan.

B008BM9L72|1.0|The story idea had potential, if only the author would have had a larger vocabulary and an elegant pen in which to express it.  The copy paste &#34;exotic&#34; sections of the book did not add any substance and were simply monotonous.  Such a shame, a disappointment, and a senseless waste of time.  It is hard to believe this book has such a hype surrounding it.
B00DCX08MW|5.0|As I a cancer patient and have to avoid the sun as much as possible, this is an excellent way to enjoy flying airplanes for me.  It is also a great pass time.
B000R8YC18|5.0|This freakin movie is one of the best movies out there period! I can't get enough of this kick ass movie! Everybody should go out and buy it!
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|Some of the levels, (such as the plug the holes) are impossible on the kindle fire generation one. pretty frustrating.

0470570954|5.0|I never knew how lost I was in the weird and crazy world we live in until I purchased Biochemistry by Voet and Voet.<br />It really helped me get my life together again. I laughed, I cried, I even closed the book a few times in silent yet angered reflection at my contrasting viewpoints on such things as enzyme kinetics, protein purification, and gene expression.<br />Walking away from this magnificent cover-to-cover cliff-hanging awe-inspiring thriller of a text book I can honestly say I'm a better man now.<br /><br />Good read.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I have enjoyed this series SO much & loved not having to wait for the finale!  Can't wait for the 4th season.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Now we can watch whatever excellent episode we want.  Love the series and the actors.  Constantly laughing!  Have all six episodes.

B00991TCOG|5.0|Lindsey Stirling has a very unique style of music. I would not necessarily recommend her music for someone that is strictly swooned by classical violin, but more by eclectic EDM, possibly modern pop, and dub steb. I originally found her music in relation to some dub step artists, and have had a lot of trouble turning it off. If you are a Lindsey fan the least you can do is purchase her music, so she can keep on making more!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Granted, this just came on netflix, but I really liked being able to get it before, and the fact you can download it is fantastic. Really thankful for this, I was about to cry if I didn't see 8 before season 9 came out. Hope the rest of the SPN family enjoys what's to come this Tuesday.
0670014893|5.0|SPOILER ALERT: THIS DISCUSSION WILL REVEAL THE ENDING.<br /><br />I have been and am a big fan of John Le Carr&eacute; (David Cornwall).  His ability to draw you into the tale is amazing and he doesn't use gimmicks. Or if he does, I don't notice them. Recently at a writer's conference, I heard a so-called expert advise writers to \\"always start in the middle\\" to hook the reader. I couldn't resist blurting out, \\"John Le Carr&eacute; doesn't do that. He starts at the beginning and takes you step by step right through his story. And it works. He doesn't play games with the reader.\\" And he most certainly doesn't need to.<br /><br />The thing I have noticed over the years is that after his outstanding George Smiley series, where Smiley was the god guy and won at the end, despite the Le Carr&eacute; touch of devastating personal losses, he became much more realistic. Depressive, in a way, like Houellebecq in a way. He still draws the reader into the conflict and the reader still desperately wants the good guy to win, but the forces arrayed agains the good guy, or even a group of good guys--be they good guys or good gals--are just too strong. The world is about power and the government and its corporate masters have the power. Fighting against the establishment evildoers may get you killed and you aren't about to win.<br /><br />Does that take away the love of reading his stories? For me, not at all. Again, he doesn't play tricks. Here, we see the fuzzy outlines of a military--or is it?--mission and little by little we discover the tragic cost of that mission and the way it was set up to have our hero holding the hot potato if it unravels, which little by little it does. There is no game playing. The hero's quest for justice was futile from the beginning and we knew it. We hope against hope it won't be so but there is no trickery here--it is so. Tragically. And depressingly.<br /><br />But that is precisely why Le Carr&eacute; is so accomplished. He draws us into the world of the British Foreign Office, he shows us its tricks, and he shows us that if the protagonist steps out of line--which of course he will because it is the right thing to do, precisely what we hoe he will do--he will get smashed to pieces. Literally. No hope here, pal. And isn't that they way it is. No cavalry to come to the rescue.<br /><br />Le Carr&eacute; has become a bit like Henning Mandell, who makes his characters realistically morose if not clinically depressed. But Le Carr&eacute; takes more risks because he doesn't produce the silver bullet in the end.<br /><br />So, my summary: read this for a wonderful experience. But give up all hope ye who enter here!ffice, he shows us its tricks, and he shows us that if the protagonist steps out of line--which of course he will because it is the right thing to do, precisely what we hoe he will do--he will get smashed to pieces.

B003WUYRGI|5.0|Really good for children in learning some words they do noy know. I , myself even uses this dictionary now I'm in highschool.
B00F1RR3Y8|4.0|My daughter loves it.  You will want the paid version if you want all the nail colors and accessories.  Of course, it shows you all the colors you could have so your child will ask for it...  For free, it's pretty good.
B000BB1MIC|1.0|2 of the DVDs skipped or froze  when watching them. I think they might have just been left in the sun
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Fun game that also teaches self control. You only get 5 lives and if you want more they will nickel and dime you into the poor house OR you can beg your friends on Facebook like a bum. It's best to just put it down and walk away for a while - maybe talk to your family, or look for a second job to pay for extra bubbles and spells.  Works pretty well on kindle fire, every once in a while it will misfire a bubble. When the charger is plugged in it will misfire almost every time and will fire multiple bubbles at once. I've learned to just not play the game when my kindle is charging.
B005K17RU0|3.0|The app is good for multiple locations, but has a tendency to turn itself off. Otherwise, I enjoy looking up my families weather
B00112GVFO|4.0|It was pretty good! I think they could have chosen a better lead female as Penelope Cruz is not the most enjoyable actress to watch. She was good in Blow but not so much in this movie. Steve Zahn is comic relief and there's plenty of action to go around. I liked it, not boring and it didn't make me fall asleep. To all who said this is trying to be National Treasure, guess what? Every movie studio copies one another so that point is mute.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and easy to play its a game that triggers the mind and its fun cuz you have to tell yourself where to go so you don't run into a train
B00ECU2SGS|1.0|Predictable. Poor, inauthentic script. Acting ok but not worth a dime to see. I wouldn't waste my time if I were you. Disappointing.

B006T5C5PS|5.0|Not just cancer but other critical disease are addressed.  Everyone considering chemotherapy and or radiation should read this book. However this is just an introduction to a proven and successful protocol for disease of cellular dysfunction which is what cancer is.  Their is a great deal more to learn about and it is available on-line and seminars given by the Gearson Institute.  This is a book everyone should read because sometime in our lives we will either have cancer, diabetes or an another disease of cellular dysfunction or know someone who does.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I think this game is one of the funniest games on Kindle. The campaign is challenging and fun. The multiplayer has tons of awesome maps and guns. This game is AWESOME!!!!!!!

B00026WU7I|5.0|Blood on the Tracks is one of my all-time favorite Dylan albums. A must have for Dylan fans young and old.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|Compared to Iron Man 1 & 2 - this movie seemed to drag. I think the time could've been shortened. I lost interest an hour into the movie, which is unfortunate because I was a big fan of the first two Iron Man movies. Although the special effects were great - the story plot was a bit too confusing for me.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|this app could be better, if facebook allowed the new features that the full site has... they could add tagging and other stuff most users are accustom to like: True photo uploading, an floating notifications/status update bar, the ability to log out with out have to scroll to the top of news feed, the ability to share while in news feed, Etc. I feel improvements would be easy.... seeing as it is just a link to the mobile site version of Facebook.com
B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|Reminds the viewer that self-control is an iffy proposition whether socially or chemically dictated.  Reminds us that the person dictating is usually the person exempt from the controlling norms.  That being said, it is really cool science fiction and makes me want to be a grammaton cleric.
B005WUHAX8|3.0|It does its job, but i do not like how hard you have to press the screen, it's really annoying.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I've always been a fan of Star Trek and this movie confirmed why. The movie plot kept me engaged the entire movie. I didn't realize the length of time this movie was, which is good. Even my husband enjoyed this movie and he wasn't really a Star Trek fan to begin with. But I absolutely loved it.

B0058UXHHK|5.0|I'm not much of a reader, but I didn't put this book down. Fun, mysterious and an easy read. Can't wait to read the rest of the series!
0062255657|5.0|so good and on so many levels. I had to read it several times in a row because it was just so good!
B007W0YVRO|5.0|I love yiruma's music so much and felt guilty for pirating his music for the longest time so I finally got around buying some of his music. I don't generally like buying digital musics, I prefer physical mediums, because the art work is nice. I find it work wells listening to the CD whiling commuting. I highly recommend yiruma is you don't already listen to him for his new age masterpieces.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This was a truly beautiful Neil Gaiman novel. I have read all of his books (even the children's books) and this one like all the others was so wonderfully written. This may be my favorite Neil Gaiman book. He writes with such beauty that the reader is able to visualize the story. His characters are so interesting and you are drawn into their lives and get lost in the story as though you are there observing as it unfolds. This book is no exception, it was simply magical and it evoked such emotion as I read the book. I sincerely hope the Hemstocks have more to share in the near future. .
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Superb - 1,000s of fantasy books are published every year and I read scores of them and few have such an assured touch - Gaiman captures both the feel of childhood while hinting at vast, epic, magic. As comforting as hot buttered toast, as scary as a cobweb against the face in the dark. I haven't really got on with Gaiman before - my fault probably - but he's seemed too mannered, but this is a gripping classic.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is super addictive....cant stop playing.  It's a challenge but not too difficult where it becomes frustrating.  Will definitely buy more like this!!
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|A thoughtful book,  A look back at the sequence of awareness of evolution and much more.  Passion and benevolence are questioned in the grand scheme of things,

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Dr. Sleep is an great read. And like all Stephen king's other books, flows like a river over time smoothed stones. I loved this one and highly recommend it.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This is wonderful!!! I love being able to have different types of learning that involve actual speaking which would usually only happen within a classroom. Only problem is that if you don't have at least a little background in the language it seems as though it may be challenging at first. I have taken 3 college courses in German so it wasn't too bad in the beginning but if you're starting from scratch it may prove to be a bit difficult.
B00DWZHTOU|4.0|A Morgan Freeman fan, I truly enjoyed this movie.  There are some that I have not been interested in getting, but I am glad I bought this one.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|One of the most interesting and tension filled detective stories I've seen in a long time.  Each of the character's stories was riveting.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|Wow. What a crazy story. I'm at a loss of words for this story, but I'm definitely going to go read the Maze Runner series now. The Kill Order was fast paced and addictive. The plot is just so crazy, but the details are amazing. It's like The Hunger Games on crack.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The characters of Downton Abbey are like my family. This season is full of all the emotions. Those who are wondering if they should watch, get ready for a roller coaster.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Once you start reading the Outlander series, you can not just leave Jamie and Clare out there roaming who knows where. These are books that compel you to read them. Clare has physical attributes that make her any woman, not some thin, sexy beauty but a woman of real character. Then there is Jamie - the man any woman would want as her lover, protector, equal. He is stoic, tender, strong, and a physical beauty! Their adventures together and apart while not always so believable in this book, are still exciting and keep you reading as fast as you can. Ok now on to book 4
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This will simply change your everyday reality permanently...the world around you is but an illusion...but an illusion we can all manipulate. Read this book, do the experiments, and you will absolutely believe...and your sleeping creative divine force will awaken. Blessings to you.
0060523808|5.0|A masterpiece. Its clarity, readability and content make it a must have handbook for any chief executive. Like Jack Welch's \\"winning\\" this book does not hold back any punches. I do hope Mr Gerstner will provide us with another edition as the lessons from this turnaround are timeless.<br /><br />The book is brilliant on a number of levels and should be \\"The handbook\\" for all CEOs performing a turnaround.  It is in my top ten management books of all time.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book kept me reading.  You never know which way it is going. Excellent. Mmmmmmm mmmmmmm mmmmmmm<br />Three more words
B00B8M4IMK|3.0|As I said
0345803485|1.0|I had to read this after all I heard about this book and man I wish I hadn't. It was extremely hard to get through, I thought it would never end! The book is just very poorly written, everything is cliche' and the characters are very annoying! I thought I was going to scream by about the 50th time I read about Anastasia biting her lip! I can't imagine putting myself through 1,000 more pages of torture just to see how the series ends! I'm so glad I got this used for 50 cents! Horrible!
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|It takes very long except if you spend real world money to buy game dollars. Everthing in games gets expensive very fast.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|If you have not seen this season, don't read this review, it contains many spoilers.<br />This season of Supernatural is really two seasons, the first half and the second half. The first half was a continuation of season 7, which I found slow paced and somewhat tedious at times. I'll be honest, I never connected at all with the characters of Benny or Amelia. I appreciate what Benny did by getting Dean out of purgatory, and then Sam, but he just didn't have any strong storylines or any real reason to be here, other than to give Sam and Dean something else to bicker about. And as for Amelia, the only reason she was there was to give Sam someone to mope to about his life. Plus, I lost a LOT of respect for Amelia when she found out her husband was still alive, and she STILL sleeps with Sam after learning that. What a slut! Nothing against the actors who played those characters, but I just think there was no reason to see them as much as we did if they weren't going to do more for the story. So I didn't shed a tear when Benny went back to purgatory, or when Amelia faded away.<br /><br />Then, in the second half of the season, the boys finally got down to business. I really enjoyed the three trials, it was awesome to finally SEE a hellhound, and I think that the 'Men of Letters' was a great new addition to the show. I think their 'Batcave' headquarters is a great idea. It gives them a home, finally, after years of cheap hotel rooms. The closest thing the boys had to a home in the past was Bobby's house, which was burned down. I'm looking forward to having them explore around their new headquarters a lot more in season 9. We've only seen a little bit of the place; there are plenty more rooms for the boys to discover. They haven't even figured out where the electricity is coming from yet.<br /><br />As for how the season ended, I thought it was very good; I really like the addition of Abaddon, and it's very interesting that all the angels got kicked out of Heaven. Will this be enough to bring God into the picture? I have a little bit of reservation at Dean not allowing Sam to sacrifice himself to close the gates of Hell forever. It seems like the boys would have been prepared to make that sacrifice. Also, Castiel is powerless again? Didn't we do this before in Season 5? I'll go on record now as saying I wouldn't be surprised at all to see the reappearance of Michael, Lucifer, or both, seeing as how they are two of the most powerful characters in the Supernatural universe. Crowley may have been content to let Lucifer stay in his cage, but Abaddon, being a knight of Hell, handpicked by Lucifer, may not go along with this. Anyway, I'll be watching my tv when season 9 comes on the air.be enough to bring God into the picture?

030758836X|5.0|OH MY GAWD! This is a page turner, except I wanted to skip to the end of the book just alleviate the suspense derived from this entertaining plot.<br />Gone Girl is exceptionally written and, brilliantly brought to life by the two characters that intertwine their tale of their failing marriage. Gone girl toils with the readers emotions throughout the story. After finishing the story I am struck with anger and awe in a smart way a book should leave you. Well played Gillian Flynn!
B004LWZW42|4.0|I really enjoyed it.  This movie had all the trappings of the original, but set up as the beginnings of the X-Men so it was an enjoyable premise.  Acting was great and the FX was awesome.  New Mutants and the costumes were all first rate.  If you liked the first second and third movie you will enjoy this one thoroughly.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|You probably haven't heard of Hugh Howey. I guarantee you will. Just based off of this one book (hell, just based off the first chapter) I compare his skill level to Stephen King (my favorite author).<br /><br />No joke. I heard about Wool from Scott Johnson on The Morning Stream and he talked so much about it I decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />The first chapter tossed my emotions around like a rag doll. Up down, up down, surprise after surprise. I've never felt so connected to a character in just the first chapter.<br /><br />Awesome stuff. If you like to read really great writing and are into scifi and fantasy, this is your book.<br /><br />Don't trust me. Just read the first chapter. You will be hooked!
1401938906|5.0|This little book combined all the different teachings I have studied over the past 30  years and has presented the material in a concise, user friendly format.  Easy to read, easy to understand and, therefore, great for a &#34;beginner&#34; in the study of Infinite Possibilities as well as an enjoyable, applicable read for those who already recognize our connectedness..
B00CXQL828|4.0|I was excited when I first heard about this project.  I was familiar with the players in the band, and it was said they were going for that classic rock sound, which is what I really like.  Unfortunately, this is not a classic rock record.  At least not to my ear.  To me, classic rock is 70's era rock -- Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, etc...  It's what Black Country Communion was doing.  That is not what this album is.  That isn't to say that it isn't good though.  To be honest, I am hearing a lot more of late 80's early 90's rock influences, particularly Whitesnake and Soundgarden.  So, in that light, the album is still in great company, but it's not \\"classic rock\\".
1423113454|5.0|My Grandson loves the book.  He has 3 Kane Chronicles now.  His favorite author is Rick Riordan so I know I'm safe buying them.
B004XVN1T4|5.0|Typical Follett - good characters and plot with lots of intrigue.  It's a good spy story which is hard to put down.
B004J4XGN6|5.0|Looking at the startup world from the outside, it always seemed chaotic to me. Scrappy, a bit glamorous maybe, but also off-the-cuff and disorganized.<br /><br />This classic (I think it can be called that, by now) makes starting and running a startup a much clearer affair. From build-measure-learn, to executing a pivot (which is not just a buzzword, as it turns out), to the later phases of growing your company -- this is a great first read for anyone interested in bringing a startup to life. Actually, I think you should read this even if you just work for a startup -- it would enable you to make some valuable suggestions and work more effectively.
0439023513|4.0|Mockingjay, the third and last book of The Hunger Games series was just as action-packed and gripping as the previous two.  Although often read by upper elementary students, it seems too graphic and barbaric for this age group. However, for older readers and adults, the series is engaging and presents many political parallels with current administrations and world events.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Love this show. This is how horror should be done!  Can't wait to see what they do long term with this series.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read alot of reviews for Hugh Howiy books before statring the Silo Sagas.  I was at first confued at the other authors stories haveing the same additions to his Silo Saga but understood promptly after reading this first book.  Though I have not read any of the other's books I thouroghly enjoyed Hugh Howey.  I often wonder if anyone would/could survie a post=war genocide.  This makes it seem possible if there WAS beforehand knowledge.  The whole set up makes sense, not so much the &#34;lottery&#34; but there has to be some type of a system to control over-crowding in such a limited space.<br />A very good read and maybe one day I will take up the other author's books on pre Silo Saga and Pro.

B005HGZV6U|5.0|Cons: Addiction, no bacon included, and that the Blu-ray edition is pretty much the DVD version put onto a Blu-ray disc (NOT HD by any stretch of the imagination). If your buying just to watch it, get the DVD version. The only advantage I can see with the Blu-ray is that the discs are more durable.

1594202273|2.0|It's to bad that Mr. Schlosser didn't talk to any one who worked on the Damascus emergency. While his story is compelling his facts are just made up out of someones imagination. He must have gotten his information from the Major or Colonels who were on the base or back in Washington DC. The truth was that the problem could have been prevented if the captain in charge could have made a decision immediately instead of sending it up the chain of command where it languished for hours until it was too late to be fixed. It was more like the Keystone Cops than a military mission. I was stationed at Little Rock AFB for nearly four years and worked on the warhead that was on that missile. The chances of it going off as a nuclear explosion was slim to none.

B00E9P959O|5.0|Weary from a 6-year wait between albums, and having had no idea of the losses that Neil had endured, I had lost significant interest in Rush upon Vapor Trails' release.  The sheer aggression and muddy production made VT so dissimilar from Test for Echo that it proved to be the proverbial nail in the coffin for me.  In fact, I was so turned off that I didn't purchase Snakes and Arrows until two years after its initial release, but I eventually warmed up to that album due to a road trip.  Then, along came Clockwork Angels, which I harshly (though I still feel justifiably) reviewed, and I was once more disenchanted with the band.  When VT Remixed popped up in Amazon, I scoffed and thought, \\"What's the point?\\"  How wrong I was.  Not only has David Bottrill resurrected the album, it feels like a brand NEW one,  and now I feel the Remix is not only their best release since Counterparts, but would easily make their top 10.  Rush...I beg you...please have Bottrill produce your next studio album.

B00D5ZZZ70|4.0|I purchased this as a minor upgrade for a comp I built for a friend, the old cpu was Celeron g540. After replacing the old with the new(this thing) there wasn't much difference. The OS booted about a sec or 2 slower, guess it was the introduction of new processor. It rewrote the entire boot system. It undid all setting that were preorganized, never had that happen before. SO after going thru and resetting everything back the was it was and a reboot, start up was about a sec longer, some thing seemed to work a bit better/faster. Comp rating before and after gave a .6 increase cals per sec and a .6 increase to graphics. At least the games got better lol. It just depends on what you are coming from if you are upgrading that's makes a big difference or if you are trying to slowly build up to something better. I didn't expect much but got more than I expected to see out this product. I'd recommend this for anyone trying to start on a new I-core system or just want to experiment on building a system for the first time. I give this 4 stars
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I just started the game but so far it's going well! I'm not sure what the point it..It is fun though!
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|First off, let me say I have been listening to DT off and on since When Dream and Day Unite came out.  Black Clouds and Silver Linings was such a strong album, and my despair over the departure of Portnoy was quickly replaced by excitement about the addition of Mangini.  I thought A Dramatic Turn of Events was going to be a real shot in the arm for the band.  Sadly, I was disappointed with the lack of hooks and the songwriting in general.  Then along came the bland album cover of the 2nd Mangini album, and with the self-titling, my expectations were pretty low.  How happy I am to report that this release has completely reinvigorated my interest in the group.  There is not a bad a track to be heard, the songs are sonically diverse, and there are hooks aplenty.  DT is officially my favorite release from the band.<br />Rush fans: make sure to check out \\"The Looking Glass!\\"
1451696191|4.0|I concede that this book has major problems, but I can relate so well to Charlie and his friends that I have to give it a pass. I was one of those kids listening to The Smiths, making and receiving mix tapes, who thought that going to The Rocky Horror Picture Show was the ultimate in risqu&eacute; entertainment.<br /><br />Generally, I do not like epistolary books. Normally, this one would be no exception, but again, I can relate to Charlie's gang so well that I can read between the lines and flesh out the emotionally stunted narration. There are too many serious issues addressed in this book, but I either heard of or witnessed all of them during my time in high school. And I have to disagree with other reviewers who called it clich&eacute;, because in my opinion, the universality of an experience in no way makes it a clich&eacute;. If you could go through puberty without being a sloppy mess at least part of the time...
B006JPML7K|5.0|My kids and I (especially me) love this movie. It's really funny, has great art, and the quality of the film even surpasses some of the latest Pixar offerings. Hope there is a third one!
B00ANJJH84|3.0|Bought them for my daughter. She loves the original mule clog. This sandal was a bit too tight & since it doesn't come in a larger size, took off the top straps to fit better.  Still snug but she loves purple.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|The colorful graphics for Can You Escape are appealing.  However, the directions for playing the game are not specific enough.
1476733953|5.0|I can't recommend this book enough. In a dystopian future, survivors of an apocalypse live in an underground silo community with rigid sets of rules. Did the gods place them here for their own good? Is there really anything beyond the silo - does outside exist? Who knows, because all their history prior to a couple hundred years ago is gone... Or is it? I skipped studying, housework, cooking and sleep until I finished this, and I'm so glad I ordered the other two books in the series before I started, because waiting to read more would have been torturous.
B00BXKKNFS|3.0|It's OK at times I guess. Barely seems to block stuff, but it's nice when it does block those pesky ads.
0920668364|5.0|This is one of the most touching books I have ever read.  I am buying this for my great-grandson (due in November) .<br />A friend of mine told me about this book.  Her daughter reads it to her first & second grade classes  at the end of the school year.  After reading it myself,  tears came to my eyes.
B00EF1PKJQ|5.0|What do you say when someone takes a whole genre, writes, performs, and makes us rethink the possibilities of said genre???  WOW?
B002BSHXJA|5.0|All CDs and inserts were like the actual album....!  A must buy for any Beatles' lover!!!  Went to the Ringo exhibit down at the Grammy museum, and listening to the cds was amazing....!  Great birthday present for hubby!!!  Thanks again for the deal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00CF34B2I|3.0|great game works great with my original kindle fire. however. when you add wifi adhoc multiplayer I will purchase. until then no money for you. you included this feature on the ipad version. but ipad's suck
030716327X|5.0|I bought this book for my future great-grandson who is due in November.  It was a suggestion from his mommy (my grand-daughter).  I'm sure his mommy & daddy will enjoy reading it to him.  The bunny is just so cute.
5551369242|5.0|If your child liked &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; and you haven't popped this book into their hands, than you are doing them a disservice.  Truly one of the great collection of stories from the master
B00992CF6W|5.0|I l u.v this game it is the best I luv spawn eggs and BUDDER well gold this is awesome and 5 star rate!!!
0425267695|5.0|This book blew me away, it has an amazing plot and the writing is flawless, finished this one in a few days.
B00ARPMIJE|5.0|Loved this book so much. So entertaining and I cant wait to read the next book. I love it and nobody can change that.
0316204366|5.0|Malcolm is simply great in insights. As watching his speech on TED, noticed his stand, occasionally toe pointed in, observing a mystery, is a bit perplexed, wondering. The Goliahs in our land of politics, business and authors surely walk with swaggers, stand firm ready for any disputes. But Malcolm.....Ha he is David. Bravo!!
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a fun logic game using numbers rather than words.  The only thing I would like to see is an undo when you make a mistake like hit the wrong button.
076531178X|5.0|This book is awesome, great plot, great characters and great writing. One of my favorites, that is for sure .
B007URVZJ6|3.0|It covers everything you need to know about publishing on Kindel/amazon.  It could use more pictures and tell you why you must do thing the way you have to.  After publishing one book everything makes sense but until you do it is like groping in the fog.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Nice balance of simplicity and mental challenge.  Good graphics and good selection.  Would like to buy more levels.  I recommend it!  I think you will too.
B003L77G10|5.0|I watch every episode multiple times. I love the writing. The show moves at a pace that keeps my heart racing. And each character feels very real.
0765316889|5.0|This book is awesome, great plot, great characters and great writing. One of my favorites, that is for sure .
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I didn't read for pleasure.  I picked up Fifty Shades after hearing it was being banned in some libraries.  I loved Fifty Shades.  I read it in a matter of hours.  I was compelled to continue the series.  Fifty Shades Darker was even better.  It was action packed. The ball was fun.  I liked the ordeal with Leila and how that actually started in the first book.  The thing with the boss was good. The thing with Charlie Tango had me bawling like a baby.  The birthday party was exciting. I don't think I gave too much away.  This story is amazing.  The writing style and repetitions are insignificant for me.  I just love this story.
B001NBEWN6|4.0|I enjoyed the book, however, it was difficult to follow at times because of the way the author used flashbacks to tell the story. The names were unfamiliar to me so I had a hard time keeping the characters straight.  Once I got past that, I couldn't put the book down.  Very well written. M
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|It was cute.very nice graphics. Would be great for a family night but not to long so kids should stay focused.
B004132I20|5.0|They did an awesome job of modernizing SH without losing its integrity, wit, and intellectualism.  Past paced, without rushing, and completely engaging.  They kept true to the original stories, but updated them so that it fits with our current technology and knowledge of the world.  Despite the length of each episode, you won't even miss the time you spent and will be craving more!
B004K58GSO|5.0|For those who enjoy westerns and movies prior to special effects this is a good one. Light hearted interplay between the characters offsets the trouble they face. Robert Mitchem has a comedy role - something I don't remember him doing in any other film - and he does it well. James Caan is a surprise for a western but he pullled it off as well. The remaining cast all play their parts as the seasoned veterans they all are.  This storyline is the same as Rio Bravo, but much more entertaining for the humor being added.
B009O2XY12|5.0|i am still trying to get three stars on all levels but i keep trying  i cannot quit until i have cleared the whole thing  try it you will go slap happy
B004YXE438|3.0|For a pay app, 50 or so puzzles is definitely not worth it.  There are a few puzzle packs available for $1 each, but they only contain about 60 puzzles themselves.  If this weren't a FAOD, I wouldn't be spending money on it.  For $1.99 you'd think there would be a lot more puzzles included.  And the lower difficulties are just a waste of space, it isn't really fun and challenging unless you're playing on the &#34;huge&#34; puzzle level.
B009M2T7K6|5.0|my 5 year old daughter loves it !,  the colour changing  and features work ok ...  It is exactly as advertised ...for once  :)
B001ACH4DS|5.0|Some of the AI alumni DVD are disappointing.  Why don't they sing the songs like they did on the show?  This CD, however, is great.  I love his voice.  He's really underrated.
0375805613|5.0|The book is really engaging as the child can't wait to turn the next page and see what furry, lovable old Grover is up to. A classic!
B0059QJ2D6|5.0|The American remake, though well-done, doesn't have the gut wrenching nor, of course, the originality of this well acted film exploring trust and commitment and danger and heartache. A superb experience.
0896760278|4.0|Much more than I expected. I will definitely be looking to purchase other books by this same author. Very informative.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|I love them.  What can I say.  Best boy band in the world.  So glad Kevin is back.  The songs are a bit different from their typical songs but it goes with maturing.  As always, they harmonize like no other!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Humorously written. I didn't think it was typically DeMille, but it held my interest and I would recommend  it for it's clever comments.
B008Y212PI|5.0|The tutorial was very good since I had never played this type of game before. This is a simple logic game, but it's fun and easy to play. The pictures are interesting and pretty. I like that it isn't timed. So no pressure!
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|The game is complete.  Graphics are smooth, the gameplay is simple and the design is elegantly clean.  It just plain works.
0439023491|5.0|I love stories like this.  Well written, great themes, metaphors, sub-metaphors.  The movie's great but books will always rule.  I can't wait to read the last one.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|wanted to see  the book  it got so many hits.  Should have realized it had to do with sex.  Weak story line.  I'm not a prude but it left me flat.  I suppose every kid in America has already read it.  Hollywood knows where the money is.
B008Y212PI|4.0|fun game, easy levels almost too easy at times hard to see the upper levels on my phone!!  all in all fun game
B005HJWWW8|2.0|Didn't find it did much for my Zip Clip with any ear phones or head phones.  Different MP3, maybe different results
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|No one can beat the original American Idol.  This CD is probably her best yet.  I get bored listening to the same singer/CD but I can listen to her CD on any road trip many times over.  There's love, there's hate, there's anguish.  She sings with so much passion and that voice!  Luv her!
0393024415|5.0|The book is layed out like a psychology session between a group of people struggling with communication issues between themselves and their kids. One of the most difficult hurdles to jump. I must read. The little forms they have in the book are eye-openers too. Puts the parent in the kids' shoes.
0739319175|4.0|It fits the paradigm of his books perfectly, but it does give some history and technical information that's fascinating.  I really enjoyed it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Enjoyed the contrast of the workers perspective with the owners.  Made it very interesting. Now on to Breaking Bad next.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|I loved it! I haven't read the book but now I want to even more! I love this movie great great great!
B00079FUI6|5.0|This TV series is so funny! So entertaining! So serious. So dramatic. I bet you'll find that you know someone that's just like one of the characters in this show.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great story! I couldn't stop! Highly recommended. Don't hesitate, start reading it now. Is unbelievable intriguing and you find yourself supporting and hating and loving the same character every time.
1401937268|5.0|Ecstatic, and surprised how direct like an arrow the messages came out in my tarot spread. Phenomenal artwork helps pull an even deeper message through.  Great use of color.  Beautiful design, and outlay.  This tarot works!  It is \\"safe\\" as outlined in the description.  I use my other tarot deck, and it holds a whole different vibration.  You will feel the Archangel(s) come through.  Do not hold back if you did not want to buy this deck, or are not used to the loving concept (soft images) behind this tarot deck.  It is better to get the message than not.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|A quick read but still great. As always, Sanderson is top notch with world building. I'd love to read more from this world, but regardless this novella is worth reading!
B004LWZW88|5.0|great! Love to watch the movie.. and in Blue ray makes it so much better!  digital copy don't work on andriod phone though.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game once you figure it out. Each step is more intriguing to unlock to the next step. It's really fun once you get the hang of it. LOL.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Wow, I don't even know where to begin..this book was phenomenal!! The way everyone's lives intercepts, the way justice prevails and how it may not make you feel the way you intended or expected. The author did a great job touching on different experiences we all face in life, that you may think you know why someone did what they did but you never know what someone else is hiding, what may eat away at them day by day. The epilogue was perfect, it gives you a different  perspective of what could have been. Everything happens for a reason.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Great movie!!!  From the beginning to end.  Watched it a second time and it was better...a must see for sure
B0083Z3O8Y|4.0|I thought the characters in this book were really well-done.  The Kindle version reads well.  It's a pretty lengthy book and a lot of it is more about the characters than the action, so it is somewhat of a time investment and requires some patience, but I really enjoyed it and I would say it's worth reading.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Loved it and Charlie Hunnam is brillant.  Violent but what I expected. Katie Segal is also great as Mum to all
030758836X|5.0|Excellent read! Will keep you guessing!! Makes you really think before you do your girl wrong! But they are both pretty crazy!
B002LVVCQM|5.0|Richard Dawkins just has certain ways of explaining concepts and ideas. I came into this book knowing very little about evolution, this book has taught me very much though, an  i would gladly recommend it to anyone interested in the subject. It is a true testament to biology, and the evolutionary theory. Something needed in America due to the unwillingness to hear reason, an  just bury themselves in their<br />  hole of comfort and religion.
B005TKD512|5.0|Excellent book- allow yourself time to read it and take notes. Very accessible text with lots of interesting, real life examples on how to manage change - big and small - from losing some unwanted weight, saving a marriage or rebuilding a multimillion dollar company.
B002KGEORM|5.0|love this series.  Violent and just like I imagine a bikie gang to be.  Protective of what is theirs.  Jax is a great character
B00594XOZU|1.0|Its been working awsome and all of a sudden it wont let me log back in orrr make a new account. Im getting very upset...
0345803450|3.0|Falls short of other McEwan novels. The characters are interesting but the narrative just doesn't seem to take these characters anywhere interesting or satisfying.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Just a great novel.  My husband says he is going to read it. Please write more books like this one.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It was an awesome read!  Loved every minute of it and the ending was great!  It had a way of pulling you in emotionally to every character.  Loved, loved, loved!!!
B0047VSW30|5.0|Great actors,depicts era very well and the politics surrounding evolution vs creation between the Christians and the Pagans. Paints a good picture of Hypatia and the challenges she went through as a brilliant, beautiful and aggressive woman that was light years ahead of her time.Her triumphs and defeats....heart breaking.
B001DJ7PR8|2.0|In many of his films Woody Allen has portrayed the cities he loves and knows well -how can you love something you don't know?- with supreme sensibility and soulful understanding: New York first and foremost, -to wit, the iconic Manhattan- but also London, Paris, and even Rome. But something must have happened to Woody on his way to Barcelona, he just does not have the slightest idea of what the city is about, and so the film is an endless sequence of faux clichés and quick desultory shots to a ridiculous background of Spanish guitar music. Ridiculous because everything that is supposedly evocative of Barcelona is wrong: the two main Spanish actors, Bardem and Penelope Cruz, have no connection whatsoever with the city. You could argue that the population of Barcelona is diverse, and that you could find characters like Bardem and Penelope there, but that would be missing the point. Neither actor is quintessentially Barcelonian.<br /><br />Why would anyone wishing to set a film in say, Glasgow or Edinburgh, pick English actors for the leading roles? And yet Woody Allen must know that Barcelona is the capital of Catalonia, and that that fact deserves more than just a passing joke in the introduction of the film.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|&sup3; bondage know know know joe know you lol no go go go home losers you all such so much lol
B0094M2ITG|2.0|I watched with my wife and 2 teen aged children and we got tired and stopped the video.  I think the story offered value (I could see where it was going) but was too weirdly done in this movie.  Likely a great story worth reading (if available in a book?).  Don’t waste your time!
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! Crazy super zombies are taking over the world and no one knows what to do. Then enters Brad Pitt. Enough said! Also, I love that this movie features some strong female leads that aren't your typical damsels in distress! Two thumbs up World War Z!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|fast past easy to learn beast rpg game. one of my top faverit tablet games. should download and atlest try it out. :D
B004GYY714|3.0|Good show. Funny seriuos  and down to earth topics and issues. Can be a winner. Invite more guests. Love the hosts!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Smartly done!  Typical aristocracy soap opera drama keeps you glued series by series.  Top notch acting, cinematography and love seeing the styles of the bygone era makes it worthwhile.
1400049628|5.0|I bought this book for my girl friend after she was done reading world war z by max. She loved both book hardly ever put them down!
0763660531|5.0|Beautiful pictures, thought provoking and fine detail.  Children will love finding the bird that connects the story.  Each page is a visual delight with a surprise in the middle of the story.
B003M6EAXM|5.0|It was good not bad. Very entertaining like the rest of the show. If you've been watching it you'll love this
B00594XOZU|2.0|I had kik for my kindle and it used to work fine now it won't let me log in I hope they fix it :c
B005PK57NU|5.0|Loved power watching - as many episode at a time that I could stand.  So hooked, I am buying each current season episode on Amazon for 1.99 ea.  Worth it.
1476751935|4.0|While I think this is a very useful book for some, it lacks much for wide use.  I picked up The Secret about four years ago and realized that I was not ready for it.  That's the first thing:  one must be psychologically ready.  Secondly, I felt it was the icing on the cake and not the cake itself.  For that, I went to Master Key System by Charles Haanel.  This work will not be for many, since it is very dense reading and effortful study - yet definitely worth it.  Here is where the meat and the heart of The Secret lie. If you're really ready to delve in and make changes, you'll need more than The Secret - unless of course you're one of those people who already has the secret.  Having said all that, I reread The Secret this year and then bought the Master Key System.  If I want a little something to take to sleep with me, I now pick up The Secret and open it at random.  I have however read it through carefully two or three times. So this is why I give it four stars.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Typical of most of Stephen King's work, once I started reading I didn't want to put it down.  He never disappoints.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This is dumb it says i cant play till i download the stupid up load and i cant do it and i cant play till i down load the up load.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|This book was recommended to me.  My expectations were rather low.  But the narrative quickly pulled my in.  There is some fascinating information in this, a good story and it is well written.  I would recommend this for anyone who enjoys non-fiction.  But for anyone that even dabbles in jogging/running, it is a must read.
B004MPESSY|5.0|First don't get this expecting to find a remake of the original, basic story line is the same however, the revenge acts are different and much more violent. The original was a good movie but compare 1976 movie special effects with today and they don't compare. This newer version brings it more modern, better suspense, better thrill, more violence, better written. Not a movie for young ones due to violence, rape, torture, graphic nature, language. Sarah Butler is a beautiful actress that plays the role of the victim so well you become emotionally attached. The her revenge is so calculated, so planned, with vengeful acts of violence that will make any guy cringe. Definitely not horror but suspense thriller yes and a very good one, not for the youngins but a great flick.
B00CHVIAS4|5.0|Absolutely wonderful movie. One of the best animated films of the decade. The colors, the 3D effect, the originality is highly imaginative. Highly recommended for the entire family. And this 3D Blu-Ray edition is perfect.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This dictionary is very helpful it came with my kindle fire hd it has a feature were you can search<br />For the word
1936041111|5.0|Compared to some of the crap I've read by supposedly \\"good\\" authors, this one is a gem.  Shelley as a precocious 19 year old penned this book from her active imagination.  The story is so cohesive and well-written it's truly unbelievable that it was written by a teenager.  She has a knack for expressing abstract thoughts with few words.  Additionally, her writing flows easily and places the reader in the subjects' mind.  In short, it is artistic writing. If you're looking for a lot of action, you won't find it in this book.  The author's style is to write about relationships, feelings, mood, and setting.  Frankenstein ironically is Victor Frankenstein the main character.  While the Frankenstein of the movies incorrectly gives this name to the monster.  One of the reasons this story has remained a classic is because of the originality of the idea. While I've seen most of the Frankenstein movies, I decided to read the book while on vacation so I can understand the author's original focus and ideas.  It took me about 10-11 days. It didn't disappoint.  I found it very enjoyable reading and highly recommend it to anybody.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Enjoyed watching and not having killing or detective things going on.  Just a nice funny movie. I would recommend it.
B00DJ80VLS|2.0|Honestly- this is a step back from A Dramatic Turn of Events which was a huge step back from Black Clouds and the one before Systematic Chaos.  Not sure whats going on with them.  I regret the purchase but support DT on most all their albums.  Hopes this helps.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its a fun game. its good for passing time and can get kind of challenging. at first I had problems loading it but after that it was fine.
B00000FC5H|5.0|This is a timeless album and one of the best albums ever done!<br />The music is uplifting and classic 1970's.  A must have for anyone who is<br />serious about American music.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|Beautiful case for mi Canon Rebel T2i Camera, is very well protected. It also can store memory cards, a cleaning cloth, the charger, an extra battery. Is super usefull for taking it to small events if you don't want to carry a larger bag with extra lenses and a tripod.<br /><br />I got this model instead of the new one because I find the new model not as good looking as this one, especially regarding the color choice the used for the new one, that orange does not convince me.<br /><br />Veredict.....<br /><br />100% recomended
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This is a PERFECT game-wonderful updated throwback to games like Galaga.  It gives you more than adequate boosters and extra upgrades to your fighter ship and does not drag the fight with the Big Bosses on forever.  I like this game (beat it but still play the other variations).
1444737112|5.0|A cute, sweet, heart warming, easy  read.  A must read, a cat person will love.  I'm getting the next book.
0800141601|5.0|We always enjoy this film. We first saw it on TV, then we bought the VHS tape; now we have the DVD so we can continue to enjoy it for a long time.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|Funny.  Funny. Funny. I was not expecting to find this game to be as funny as it is.  I love the little costumes and change hats often.  The part I find the funniest is when they get to the challenge and start flailing their arms like two girls fighting!  Funny. Ok, it is actually easy to maneuver, the controls are simple, and the graphics are more than adequate.  I love it.
B00F8L2VO4|2.0|It's just okay - Easy to use, however I don't want to use social media to participate or have to be online to use it
B000O8OTNC|5.0|great knife sharpener at a great price.  is very compact, smaller than i thought.  leave this in your tool/tackle box and your good to go!
B004D0YB5S|5.0|If you haven't seen the documentary of this man stop reading reviews and first go check it out.<br /><br />Then after you restore an old turntable or buy one... PLEASE BUY THIS RECORD.<br /><br />He made the jumpsuit he's wearing on the cover. Just buy it.
1426308469|4.0|This dinosaurs book was Sturdy, colorful and very affordable. I was especially impressed with the ease of ordering and the fast delivery. Not suitable for really young children due to the content and large words.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|My grandson gets his Star Wars birds n plays along.  He is 7 years old. I tried the game n it is challenging.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|Best EQ for Android. Tried many and this was by far the best and easiest to use EQ I found.
B00C1S945G|5.0|Thanks for offering the HD version.  I'm able to enjoy this great series all over again.  I like the 'upgraded' orbital planet scenes.
B00F91H15W|1.0|I bought this movie thinking it would be a fun film I could watch a few times. Its HORRIBLE!! Seriously the only fun part to watch is when the kids are in Paris Hilton's house playing with all of her stuff. This story is not worth a movie! Don't know what they were thinking. Skip it! Watching the tv show about Alexis Nyers is way better than this crap.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|It was great!  What can I say, &#34;I'm a Trekkie at heart&#34;  I know some complained about the story line and how it was<br />done, but I found it still kept my interest, got my nerves going and at the end it really came together.<br />I love the actors.  And even though there was violence with bringing Khan back, it wasn't gratutious.  Can't wait for the next one to come out.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I really love Harvey's character in this show..Amazing cases stories which makes you think how they are going to solve...Really worth watching it!!
B00A9ET4MC|2.0|I liked reading about Nigeria when I began this book.  The content was interesting And I was engaged by the story of young love.  I liked it less and less the more I read and finally I was reading simply to finish for my book club.  In the end I had formed an active dislike for the main character, Ifem, and I became bored with the author's rant on race.  I am sympathetic to many of the issues she raises but her tone became insistent and began to irritate me long before the end of the book.  Ifem was unsympathetic and her intense self absorbed behavior made her unattractive to me.  I'm glad to be finished with this book!
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|The giver is a great representation of a utopian society. Lois Lowery does a wonderful job of showing the emotions and the daily life of people in this situation, along with giving you a lot to ponder when you're done.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I choose this rating, because it was a great book to read. I totally recommended it, for the people who wants to learn new things :).
147674355X|1.0|I couldn't even finish this book and barely got started.  For me personally, it was just a bunch of nonsense babble about nothing.  Pretty boring in my opinion.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Reading a Stephen King book,and I have read every one I could get my hands on, is like jumping on a long water slide.  There is no way to stop, always a magical mystical tour. He is a genius at making his characters into somebody you know.  Without a doubt he is author on a par with all the great classic novelists.
083120589X|5.0|It was a pleasure and honor to have read this book. &#34;Long walk to freedom&#34; chronicles the life of Nelson Mandela told in his words about the journey from a small village boy, to a freedom fighter, fighting for the equality and liberty of the oppressed South African majority under apartheid. From spending nearly 3 decades behind bars to the first Black South African president.<br /><br />Told in that sequence, as a reader, you will learn much about the former leader. From what sparked Mandela's interest in politics to the formation of his political fighting organization. Readers will learn the commitments by Mandela in fighting against apartheid, the long years and decades of struggle, and the setbacks all culminating in the ultimate triumph against oppression.<br /><br />But, the book tells more about Mandela other than fighting for the civil right of the millions, we learn about many of his personal roles as a father, son, friend, colleague, husband, and advocate.<br /><br />&#34;Long walk to freedom&#34; is a definite read for anyone looking to learn how to make a difference in the world.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This is the best game :D it's so fun and addicting and I always make my friends download it and I like that its a game set for the safety of trains.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|since i am not that tech savvy this entire process had me fearful, but it was easy to download, use and buy songs with.  don't hesitate.
B00AFEY354|5.0|I've never been a big fan of &#34;Rocky Horror&#34; but this movie almost made me want to.  Lots of true to life issues are presented with pretty realistic outcomes.  Great acting and I finally proved to my daughter that Emma Watson wasn't really a witch.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|I love this game but its gets you made when you don't know and don't have any coins to use a hint.
B00C1TOTK0|5.0|One of the best western movies of all time. They don't seem to make them like that any more. Too bad.
B003L20IHO|4.0|Bought this for my daughter.  We watched it together, and both enjoyed it.  Sad for a while, but in the end...  Well, I won't spoil it.
B00F5FEZTC|1.0|Does he have a mouth full of marbles or what?  Do not see the quality in his work.  I will be giving this away.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Entertaining. Somewhat predictable. Good special effects. Story line could be improved.The almost ritual repeatable phrases gave the game away early.
B00866JLEG|5.0|Couldn't wait to see how they were going to turn the basketball playing, musical dude into a Marine.  I would say they did a fantastic job.  They didn't make him out to be a fighting, gun toting, one man show.  Very well done I say.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Hamlet in the world of motorcycle gangs.  Great acting and writing, keeps the viewer engaged and guessing through the entire time.  Season 2 is even better.
B000URWYTS|5.0|I bought this book because it was recommended by my sister. It was great. I read it while on a trip to Arizona, and had problems putting it down to leave the hotel.
B002ZG981E|4.0|I was really enjoying this movie, then they went one level deeper into the plot and lost me.  Yes, I'll be watching it again to reign in on what I missed the first time.
B0019TSI8W|5.0|In dealing with the mixed signals of what we want and what we perceive we want, we often become bogged in our own self evaluation, not always really seeing someone else and taking all action as a personal insult, whether meant or not. I love the line when she says that he forced her to look at issues she was either too scared or too lazy to face. I understand that. And though I commend him for trying to look beyond outward beauty to find the inner, he's really messed up. Of course, the ending is such that all will feel good about when both realize what is real and what is superficial.
B00A7YZ1KI|5.0|I can't tell you how surprised I was to find I love the Sookie Stackhouse books. This one didn't disappoint. Without reviewing the storyline and plot etc, all I can say is give any one of them a try and see if they hook you too.
B005LAIHPY|4.0|Scy-fi super freak here!  Had to check it out for grins, turns out it was pretty good.  I wonder about the &#34;imaginative&#34; folks that dream all these movies up.  On one side I'm impressed, the other...I wonder if they should be at  the &#34;Arkam Asylum&#34;
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game stimulates your brain.  It is also fun and creative.  The pics that are uncovered are colorful and artsy.
B0043URV5U|5.0|Been listening to Bob since I was 13 years old.<br />Not need to list songs.<br />They are all there.<br />Buy it.<br />Brings back memories.<br />Good music.<br />Good entertainer<br />Great song writer
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The type of book you can't put down. Fantastic writing. I have already ordered the second series. I highly recommend!
B00006FM77|5.0|More old memories, not only of playing the old vinyl, but also of the performance I saw here in Adelaide as they evangelised for McGovern over Nixon.
B009AMANBA|1.0|I have watched innumerable hours of various documentaries about Lincoln and the Civil War. I thought this movie was very dry, boring, and lacked sufficient action. I think the History Channel, Ken Burns, PBS, and others did a much better job of telling the whole story of Lincoln. Our 16th President was really an extremely interesing Character. This DVD did not do justice to the entire personality of Abraham Lincoln. I think that focusing an entire film on passage of the amendment to abolish slavery, was a waste of time.
B00005LW7R|2.0|There is nothing wrong with the recording except or the fact that its in Italian and I ordered it in english
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|This is an interesting movie. I found it entertaining. I enjoyed the characters and how they evolved. I would recommend it as a good watch.
B009GX6600|5.0|NCIS has well-developed characters that I can care about, along with believable scenarios and up-to-date politics.  Even though Ziva is apparently leaving, the circumstances are credible.  The focus on &#34;dong the right thing&#34; throughout the show makes it very watchable
B003B02O0A|5.0|Read in the 1990s, but forgot what a great read it was.  The thing about us southern folks is we can and do laugh at ourselves loudest and longest.  I laughed so much I cried.  Will read again when I need a feel good moment.
0783231202|5.0|I love movies based on TRUE STORIES, so I particularly liked this one; even though most of it was sad (but then how much of history is \\"happy\\"?).  I liked the happy ending very much (how the situation was resolved in the supreme court with regard to the slaves wrongly shipped to the Americas), and it made it worth watching. It's nice when something \\"good\\" finally happens in history; much of human history is so sad -- people just being extremely mean to each other -- in mind-boggling ways.
0449000729|5.0|This is a very comprehensive history of the British Isles in Michener style. It is a novel but gives you good insight to the beginning and development of the countries. A good, informative read.
B000QJM8Z0|5.0|I love this book so much!  It had me roaring with laughter from page 1.<br /><br />I could not care less when it comes to criticism of the literary value or triteness and predictability of this story.  What draws the reader in is the honesty of Bridget's inner dialogue, and what keeps the reader is realisation of how much it sounds like one's self.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|I simply LOVED it!!!  I thought Jackie Chan was awesome! -- so was Jaden Smith. Very entertaining! It's an update of the old \\"Karate Kid\\" series (and set in China instead), but you won't be disappointed!
B000MV8ABS|5.0|Awesome movie. Bought all 4 for my husband an i had never watched the. They all arrived in an awesome timely manner an the movies are old but cool an awesome.
B00EHMG358|5.0|Although the final is not out yet, I look forward to reading the rest in November.  Probably finish it in a day or two.
B0068TJLSY|4.0|I thought this would be a \\"coming of age\\" video and although it isn't my usual fare, I thought it was pretty good and worth watching.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|this app is fantastic I tried to download a game for my kindle fire and didn't. have enough. memory. this cleared a lot for me so I could down load it no problems
B00005JKZV|5.0|Enjoyed seeing this version of the characters and action I had visualized.  I will watch it over and over because there is too much for just one viewing.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|This is an amazing story. As you read it you have to remind yourself that this was written by a fourteen/fifteen year old girls. Typical teenage thoughts come through even though she is in a very hard time. Your heart just goes out to her.
B0026IWNZ4|5.0|Great final line. I watch the entire movie just to hear the last line in the context of the movie, &#34;That will do pig, That will do.&#34; Well, there is really more to it than that. I like stories in which a nice person (or pig) gets kicked around pretty much throughout, remains unfailingly nice and comes out of tough times with a triumph. That's Babe!
B00ATK02WM|5.0|Enjoyed seeing this version of the characters and action I had visualized.  I will watch it over and over because there is too much for just one viewing.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Lots of historical information, especially for those who have not heard of the Orphan Trains. Interesting twist at the end.
1476733953|1.0|The book started extremely strong, as noted from the subject line here. After Part I of the book, though, everything goes down hill, and I actually had to put the book down for good after 120 pages. Not trying to reiterate what every other one star reviewer has already said, but feel it's necessary to save those who are viewing all the five stars and thinking the same thing I did: \\"I have to buy this book. I have to buy it now.\\"<br /><br />Don't. Trust me. This is slow, boring, repetitive, and I'm amazed that someone who took the self-publishing route was able to sell so many copies (nothing against self publishing; just shocked this is the book that made it, is all). Overly descriptive, and on multiple occasions I noted times where a few pages could be condensed into a paragraph or two; I'm pretty sure Hugh Howey was trying to hit a certain word count as he wrote during his lunch breaks as a book seller.<br /><br />I don't give one star reviews often. I don't quit on books often. I did both on this one, and would not recommend wasting your time or money on this poorly crafted garbage.
B005CAATXG|5.0|I love Icon for Hire.  I just went to their concert last night and that only increased my love for them, and to think I kind of discovered them by accident!  This is a great album from first song to the last.  I'm sure this album is near the top (if not the top) of my most played songs in my music library.  I don't think I can list my favorite songs off the album since they are all my favorites, but I'd say the highlights for me are \\"Off With Her Head\\", \\"Iodine\\", \\"Up in Flames\\" and \\"Get Well\\".  The slower songs, \\"The Grey\\" and \\"Only a Memory\\", are also powerful and great to add even more variety.  I love how they mix rock, metal, electronic, and pop music styles in one amazing package.  My only complaint with the album is that it is a little short.  I want more!  Good thing they have their sophomore release coming up.  At the concert they said they had more freedom in creating their second album and the songs are sounding excellent so far and I think I might end up liking it even more than Scripted.  I can't wait to get it in a couple weeks!<br /><br />For great music that comes from an amazing band that treats their fans like close friends, pick up Scripted as well as their self titled second album that comes out on Oct 15!
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Thoroughly enthralled with the plot and the scenario...wish I had more time to read...but am excited about the ending...keeps me enthralled.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wonderful series full of unique people. Good clean fun. No nudity or Volger language and you don't have to worry your kids watching it with you. I love this show and all the twists and turns are great!
B003KRJNBW|5.0|Post apocalyptic cinematic perfection. End of discussion. Denzel Washington and Gary Goldman are cast perfectly. This movie needs to be seen multiple times.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|IT IS INFORMATIVE AND FUN. EADY TO USE . TEMPERATURES ARE RIGHT ON. IT IS A VERY GOOD APP TO HAVE.
B004MPESSY|3.0|Extreme R rated scene, and then Revenge with no mercy!! I am Ready to go and see part two now..
B000KJZWMW|4.0|Ozzploitation! Post apocalyptic Australia. George Miller is a cinematic genius. I grew up on these movies. Love the entire concept and can't wait until my kids are old enough to watch the Mad Max trilogy. The Road Warrior is the best one. The villains are great. I'm just glad my son isn't wild like the one in Mad Max 2.
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|I saw the show.... it was incredible !!!! only madonna can offer us that kind of show, but i do not understand how could she aproved this horrible quality blu ray in the big tvs age. No sound from right speaker... may be an error or a manufacturing fail but, the video quality ????.... it seems a VHS !!. Why ?... she didnt see before ? she didnt have a 1080P tv?? . Im so disappointed an waiting for a new total edition.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Besides learning way more about all sorts of lethal weapons than I could have imagined - especially military weapons - I loved the non-stop action.  Reacher shows a more human side here, although he  's as tough and unstoppable as ever in the end.  Good female character, too, one to admire..
B004V9MU86|5.0|A very thought provoking book that I sometimes could not put down but sometimes I had to because I knew something awful was going to happen.  I finished the book with a lump in my throat and the need to re read  the last chapter as I didn't really want it to end there.
B00CATSONE|1.0|The book doesn't discuss Tesla as much as the author babbles on about what makes a person extraordinary. Other books are better.
B00E3D7WGU|5.0|Excellent Recording of the whole show, i cant wait to transfer them into my Itunes Library so i can carry my favorite songs  everywhere .
B00632HWOG|5.0|I can't believe it took me so long to start using this app. Far superior to the original emailnappnin the Kindle Fire. Great experience.
B00DI75SWM|3.0|I really liked the app but it wouldn't let me save or share any of the keep calm posters I made, it was very frustrating
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I love start Trek into Darness,was well made , one of the Best movies of the year , i would recommend anyone  to get it and enjoy this movie,<br />The Delivery was Fast.
B0050DZ8J0|1.0|Linked in is another waste of space. Linked in to what? I haven't figured out why I downloaded it in the first place. Linked in media in its' original form is useless too.
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|My daughter really enjoyed reading this book and she's  12 yrs old, it's a good book and simple  to read.
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|5 stars , best tour of year, noone can come close to the Queen , even if they try , Madonna is and will always be the Queen of Pop .<br />There`s only 1 Queen and that`s  Madonna....bch !
B00BU8RNCE|1.0|I can't review what I never viewed. I don't know where this comes from. I never downloaded it. I'm stumped
B002L5GQGY|5.0|I've been in love with good guitar playing for 40 years ,and I believe Joe Bonamassa is the most fluid, precise guitar player I've ever heard (and seen). His riffs are so economical, and harmonious that they create songs that are utterly suberb. And,in combination with his underated vocals make him a really great artist! This recording at the Royal Albert Music Hall is suberb, and a concert that is completely  tremendous. These songs, once you've grooved to them a few times, will be in your head for weeks, and you'll be going back to enjoy this show over and over again. If you love the blues ,this is a must have DVD!
B00EPQQ2PW|5.0|Love this album so so so much. Very upbeat and fun. You can feel the energy while you are listening. Also, just as amazing live, if you ever get the chance!
B000002KGT|5.0|As great as expected, but I knew that going in!  Now I just have to track down the dirty dog that &#34;borrowed&#34; by first &#34;Rumours&#34; CD and never returned it.  Great price, too!
B00CEB5QU2|4.0|Works great with wifes Nexus 7, very light, hope it lasts awhile. Wife does audio books and being able to put them on micr sd cards keeps them off the tablet.
6305428042|5.0|The best Halloween movie EVER! You can't get through the month of October without watching this, and for only $8 you can watch it over and over again without having to comply to the TV schedules!
B000068FWC|5.0|Love it, but then again I saw them in concert right after this album was released.  That might skew my perception.  For those who aren't familiar with the music of Supertramp, there are four key albums that are the essentials to consider purchasing: 1) Even in the Quietest Moments; 2) Crisis? What Crisis?; 3) Crime of the Century; and 4) Breakfast in America.  The harmonica (yes, harmonica) lead-in on the opening cut of &#34;Crime of the Century&#34; is legendary.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|It was a great book with many exciting adventures an I can't wait for the sequel it was also a great mythology book.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|Great upbeat tunes that can help get you out of a funk! I am addicted to listening to this album when I'm at work or at the gym. Give it a shot, you'll love it too!
B000JLQSW4|5.0|Digital re-mastering is a wonderful thing!  The bonus &#34;in progress&#34; tracks were also nice, but I would have been happy with just the original album, digitally re-mastered.
B00CL0J99K|3.0|If you are thinking of purchasing this DVD Set for your collection I would say it is a good buy for the price.  The product arrived early and presented with good digital and audio features.  My issue is more about the movie in general.  Sadly, my wife and I couldn't help but be bored at times (a majority of the middle of the film) and feel that the writers were going for a more unrealistic means that just didn't feel as believable as the other two films.  Granted, none of them are really believable, but this one stretched that limit perhaps too far.  I will try not to spoil the film for anyone with all of our reasons, but I will say we were most disappointed with the representation of the Mandarin.  You would have thought his rings could have been tech related and play more of a role like in the comics, but sadly this was not even close to the case.  Don't get me wrong, the film was okay, but not great.  Parts of it were funny, there were a few good action sequences, and they attempted to pull you in with emotions at times.  However, we feel the other 2 films did a better job.  This is only my wife's and my option and you might feel it was the best Iron Man Film thus far, but for us, it ranks last in the series.  If you have not seen it, you still need to purchase it or at the very least watch it just to form your own opinion.  In either case, it is a good buy for what you get.  I hope this review helped.
B003EVWDR0|4.0|It's a great movie with amazing special effects, but the story underneath the topical story is an old one.<br />Human greed.<br /><br />I could write a thousand page book about why we humans don't deserve to survive, but no one would change the way they live even when they heard and knew the truth of how undeserving we are to be here.<br />All anyone cares about are their own lives - their family - their status quo and screw what we might be doing to our world.
B000002GB9|4.0|Great price for this classic from the 1970's, but the music is not digitally re-mastered.  The great Amazon price gives it four stars.
B005LAIIGM|3.0|In space, no one can hear you scream... or your last gasp.<br /><br />On the final space shuttle mission headed by astronaut Matt Kowalski (Clooney), Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock) is brought along to install a new type of software she designed.  Disaster strikes when the team is endangered by debris from an 'accidentally destroyed' Russian satellite.  The wreckage also damages other satellites in its path, disrupting communications.  Stone becomes separated from the now-destroyed shuttle, and the race is on both to find her and get to the safety of a nearby space station before the next orbit brings the fast-moving debris back around again.<br /><br />The cinematography is, without question, amazingly beautiful.  Photos of deep space always illicit a thrill in us earthbound mortals, and this one's no different.  Some of the visuals and creative imagery, such as reflections on the astronauts' visors and the views of Earth from low orbit and Bullock spinning uncontrollably in space, will absolutely grab you.  There's also sub-text of being born again- with Bullock being framed in some shots as if she's in utero, complete with a loose cable symbolizing an umbilical cord, and her new life when she finally returns to earth, readjusting to gravity.<br /><br />This is a brilliant concept, and it only takes two (three if you count Ed Harris' voice only performance as Mission Control) to pull it off.  Clooney as Kowalski is a great supporting character- a consummate professional, cool under pressure, knowledgeable of the situation and a storehouse of personal anecdotes which he'll happily regale you with.  Bullock's Stone is the complete opposite- quiet, withdrawn and nervous.  We get to see the wonders and terrors of space from her perspective, and it mostly works.<br /><br />The problem is two-fold: one is Bullock's character.  She's intelligent and moderately resourceful, but also extremely high-strung and prone to panic attacks- exactly the kind of person that would not be sent into space.  After enduring the third instance of her going OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG in ten minutes, I wanted her to die already so we could get back to Clooney.<br /><br />Second: because of her character's flaws, the script has to be dumbed down to accommodate them.  Kowalski rescues her and hauls her back to the space station via tether, but somehow keeps her TALKING, so she's continually using the oxygen she's running low on!  No reason for this other than to set up the no-more-oxygen-get-inside-quick-before-you-die scene, since he could've simply kept up the chatter himself and let her relax... and save her air. Upon reaching the International Space Station, their inertia makes them collide with it; Stone gets her foot tangled in wires, barely hanging on but manages to snag Kowalski's tether before he spins away, his momentum pulling them away from the ISS.  Here all Kowalski had to do was pull himself forward and let his new inertia carry him back towards the ISS, saving them both, but again...  Once she's returned to relative safety aboard the ISS, she completely misses a small fire starting in an alcove- that she literally went right past and couldn't have missed, except the script called for her to- so our next crisis is ready to go.<br /><br />Gravity is one of those movies that was a great idea, and delivers for the most part but falls short in key areas for trying to stretch out the tension.  Not that it's a bad idea, but they just did it in the wrong ways.nt into space.

B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Tatiana Maslany is a very talented woman. The show is well written and funny and not confusing (at least, for now)<br />can't wait to see what the 2nd season is like.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|This is a gift so it hasn't been opened yet. It is new and our granddaughter loves this character. We're sure that she'll love it.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|its interesting,  has mystery aspect, and I am a fan of law, especially court room  battles.  it also includes  some amusing scenes  with campaign manager.
B003B02PEU|5.0|This is my second read of &#34;The Last Juror&#34;.  I enjoyed it even more than I did when the book first came out.  How a 24 year old northern boy finds himself in ownership of the only newspaper in a small Mississippi town and the challenges that come with it is invigorating.  Mix in a grisly murder, an educated elderly black lady and the various and often hilarious inhabitants of the town make an unusual and exciting mix of a read as well as a thriller.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|I really don't know how it compares to other programs, since I have not tried other programs, but this was a free app and I like the combination of learning the vocabulary words, pronunciation and proper sentence structure.  It is better than sitting and playing other games.  I have traveled in Germany and so I know a little already and so it was easier to get started for me.
0802130208|5.0|To buy this book on Amazon was so easy.  It was great to have the book available and with just the click of a button!
B007HXL1V0|4.0|It has been helpful in figuring out new ways of dealing with rivalry between my 4 year old and her 18 month old sister. The hard part is remembering to use the suggestions when dealing with the rivals. I re-read pages a lot and try to turn the suggestions into a habit.

B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This is the first review I've ever given, but after having read Blood Song I can't remain silent. From the he first page I felt for the character of Vaelin Al Sorna. Bravo to Anthony Ryan for writing a suburb novel of a man's journey through a life he wouldn't have asked for yet stood tall to become the hero he needed to be. I recommend recommended this book to any one who likes a good story with a surprise ending. Can't wait for the next book. HURRY PLEASE ANTHONY!!!!
B005PK56TA|4.0|I didn't care for it at first, but I gave it a second chance and became hooked about 3 episodes in. Jessica Lang does and amazing job. I can't wait to see the next 2 seasons.
B000U6BT40|3.0|The idea is interesting, the premise is kinda cute. The characters not fleshed out or real, the actors just so, so. It was available to watch for free on my Prime membership and I like to try new things I am glad it was free.
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|I wouldn't have watched this if it weren't for the reviews and I'm glad I did.  I've played Halo but never been that into it, but I love SciFi and this was so much better than I expected.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|I love it. There is just enough mix of sci-fi and humor to keep you interested. My daughter loves it as well.
159448385X|5.0|Really not my normal read but was drawn totally in to this story despite my usual lack of interest in this type of book, the saga kept me wondering &#34;Now What&#34; every chapter! And I have a much better understanding of the history and culture of a land we have had military involvement in despite not being the actual story line.
B009GQ57ES|4.0|I like the music, and it's nice to know you are supporting the artists instead of a label with this purchase.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Really great plot development and the acting was superb.  Thanks to the producers and directors too!  Hope there is more
B008M721MS|1.0|I'm away in business trying to Skype my husband and Skype is not working. I keeping failing and once it connect s it hangs up automatically saying call failed.
B00947N6D8|5.0|Loved this movie as did my almost six. year old. Good story, fun characters. There are some mildly scary parts, prob wouldn't recommend for under 4-ish years.
B00D7NWTSI|5.0|HELLO...I AM FROM COSTA RICA....<br /><br />PLEASE..COULD ANYONE TELL ME IF IRON MAN 3D BRING THE LANGUAGE IN SPANISH LATIN AMERICA...OR SUBTITLES IN SPANISH....<br /><br />GREETINGS FROM COSTA RICA.....
B004X6PRO6|5.0|If I have to write a critique every time I want to submit a rating then I might as well forget it.  Got better things to do.  Is that twenty words yet?
0439023513|5.0|I loved this entire series and I'm so sad that it's over.  I really hope that she writes another series.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|The game is excellent...lots of fun..graphics are good....challenges are easy to do great game for all ages..great way to pass time  my kids also enjoy playing the game
B003L77V3S|5.0|Though i'm not a card-carrying member of the  'Churchill fan club' as many folks out there may be, I find his life and this part of history fascinating - he delves into a part of his life i think much less well known, and his elegant writing style is only something i can aspire to.  It is amazing the perspective and approach England took to the 'little wars' they were involved in 100+ years ago, the phenomenal lucky breaks that were Churchhill's, where he capitalized on his &#34;birth position&#34; status in English society, and where he slammed it.  And the perspective on and colorful background on his parents.  Thankfully on my kindle i only have to touch the word to look it up - i won't let on how many times needed to do.  While not a quick read, totally worthwhile.
B00E6F154A|5.0|For Bryan Ferry fans or anyone that appreciates blu ray music variety... Do add this to your collection.<br />Picture Perfect and Audio to boot... Not all titles under blu ray can claim this by definition.
B005FWO3QK|5.0|This  set was marred by one of the discs being faulty, towards the end of the disc degenerated into a jumble of jumping of images
B005544TRQ|4.0|I find this to be an Entertaining show.  It has a Fun story line and fun writing. First season sets the tone.

B002KCNV70|5.0|I bought this for my six year old nephew. He thought it was great. He loved assembling the toy and lost himself in imaginative play with the characters that are included in the box.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|This game is superb!!! Great game that makes you think. This game is worth the 99 cents. It is an addictive game that entertains a lot.

B007SGM084|5.0|love the passion and intensity makes me want to read more hope there's part 4 soon also looking forward to the movie
B005HED11Y|5.0|I am completely blown away by the quality of these remastered seasons of Star Trek, they look fantastic. I do have mixed feelings about the small changes made (the way planets look from orbit, solar flares, etc,) as these were added on as part of the remastering and not in the original series, but they do look very nice. These changes are NOT like Lucas' bastardizing his original movies, but more like subtle changes. Perhaps serious die-hard Trekkies will have issue with it.<br /><br /> all in all, the remastered seasons look so good, that if you haven't watched Star Trek in years, or decades, or even ever, do give them a try. It was wonderful to revisit episodes I haven't seen since I was no bigger than a tribble.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the only game I play on my kindle it's so fun! I can't believe this was a free game!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Love this app. I'm hear on phones and when I have to get a new one, I know my songs can be easily downloaded to my new phone via app. :-)
034580404X|2.0|So far (I am on book two) these are not any better than any other five dollar paperback you can pick up at the gas station. Book one was the slowest.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|great game. fun to play never boring like all classes its a cool ogling system that you don't see alot and who can beat free lol
030789701X|5.0|The biggest and most badass guide there is!!! Great maps and guides to all locations and quests, will never be lost again. Recommend to all Skyrim players.

B00D660M6M|5.0|Great first album by Tom Odell, winner of the Brit Prize. He really puts alot of feeling into his music. I highly recommend the album.
B00BI73CVI|1.0|Charles Laughton and Frederick March will need more than these to be outdone in portraying Valjean and Javert.<br />Depardieu is close.<br />The music is emotional but unbelievable, bombastic. Even &#34;I had a dream&#34; is overworked.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved it!!!! As always King has done a wonderful job! Couldn't put it down!<br />I have always wondered what happened to Danny and this has helped answer my questions.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|we love downton abbey! it was great to be able to watch all the episodes back-to-back.  would highly recommend this item.  shipping was quick well packed.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Mr. Hosseini writes with compassion about the everyday tragedies of life in a country that has been ravaged by war.  Very gritty and enlightening.  His characters are marvelously written and his books leave me wanting more.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|Everything about this game delights me - the neat little graphics, the sounds and the fact that I can put it down anytime and pick up just where I left off.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book, keep me interested the whole time.... I would love a second book to see what happens !!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game and the Vicker battle is so awesome if u press the small robots they will explode and it would hurt him !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|CANNOT BELIEVE THIS IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE MADE INTO A MOVE!  I READ ABOUT 1/3 AND SHUT THE BOOK.  I AM NOT A PURIST AND BY NO MEANS NAIVE. BUT, THIS NOVEL WAS WAY WAY TOO EXPLICIT.  YES, I KNOW THE AUTHOR IS LAUGHING ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK, BUT...SERIOUSLY WAS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE ENTERTAINING? THERE IS ENOUGH DEPRAVED INDIVIDUALS IN THIS WORLD, THAT THIS WAS PROBABLY RIGHT UP THEIR ALLEY. SORRY I BOUGHT IT.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This pack gives you 3 options to do each puzzle, which gives you hours of entertainment. I would recommend this to anyone.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Mud gets a reality check at the end, I'm glad he survived the Whole Movie and Got away, It's a good movie to learn about how Big Bitches some (NOTICE SOME) Women can be.
B005544TRQ|5.0|After a chance viewing while channel surfing I was hooked. I am not a television junky and presently very jaded by what is shown and presented to the general public.<br />This may sound odd but this bring back to mind the days when someone personal word and integrity mattered.<br />The loyalty that is conveyed by who I consider to be the leading cast; managing partner, senior partner, associate by photographic memory, the divine legal secretary and kick arse paralegal. These are the characters that keep me hooked and waiting for more.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|Good action Movie, most of theses Movies are filled with so many Cleasheas  this is no Different, Lots of Fighting and Driving scenes, My kind of stuff.
1609611543|5.0|This book along w/Wheat Belly book have saved my life, my health. Stop eating wheat, it's destroying our health. Been wheat free for 2 months, off of 5 medications and kick all my medical specialists to the curb. Just give it a try, 30days no wheat, u will see the difference
B00COCY67A|5.0|Great to hear how Elvis worked out his songs with the outtakes. I love the outtakes as Elvis works through his songs. He liked to be funny as he found the sound he was looking for.
B009NH6JRE|5.0|Love it! It's an awesome show...especially in blu ray...had to have it...can't live without it...zombies rock! Ready for the apocalypse now!
B004OXCL5Q|2.0|I was dissapointed that i cannot play this disc on our Phil blu ray units. I don'nt know. I still have to verify if i need to buy a different player.  It didn't mention on the description that which country this disc will work.  I had several disc ordered from amazon and i have no problem with them.  This is the first time.  Too bad!
B001I45UFC|5.0|We have several copies of the Narnia series and this one was great to have as a Kindle version.  The illustrations appeared clearer than the printed book copies.  The Narnia series has a great story line and presents lots of topics to discuss with  your children.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is absolutely amazing!!! It has such a fantastic cast. I recommend it to everyone.  Best period drama ever!
B006M7JCC2|4.0|I really liked this book. It caused me to think about how my life and how my thoughts affect me and others around me. Good book!
6304401736|5.0|Got this for a child who was looking for it and couldn't find. I was glad that you had it and it works great.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|A nice bridge and story development that had plenty of twists, anxious for the next book in t he series to see where they go next.
6305161992|5.0|I got this for someone who was looking for this movie and could not find it. They played it and it works great. Thank you for the great service.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Very good story, but disturbing.  David Tennant's performance was excellent, although at times his true accent was somewhat hard to understand.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|This show is absolutely awesome. The episodes link together in very surprising and unpredictable ways. You will be completely addicted and won't regret watching it. The only disappointment is that there aren't 100 more episodes!
B00ET9T2WK|5.0|Lots of fun.  There is alot of things you can do so it never gets boring.  You don't have to buy anything, but if you want to you can.  Probably the best game I've played in awhile
B00F91SCXC|5.0|I loveeeee zombie movies! This was exciting from the get go. A little slow in the middle but picked right back up. I am assuming there will be a sequel because they did not explain a few things. Def one of the better scary movies to come out
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The more seasons the more I love it. Never watched it before until I got my Smart T V. from Amazon. Now I can't wait until Season  4 comes out. It is a great story and it keeps you  wanting more. The fourth season is going to be great I just know it. Hurry !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|I read where with Tom Cruise playing Jack Reacher ,  the film would lose something cause Reacher was a much bigger man , but they picked Cruise for the part .  I cant speak for anyone else , but I liked Tom Cruise in the part .  the only thing about the real Reacher that I read about ,  he was 6'6 and weighed about 250 .  o yes a big man and anyone that had a problem with him might have thought twice about dealing with him cause of his size .  other then that ,  Tom played the part good and I liked the movie .  Jerry
B00DF92E7U|5.0|But then with these three talented individuals on their own are awesome but when you put the three of them together, get ready to sing the blues till the cows come home!
B0072NWJRK|3.0|Midnight in Peking is not your average supermarket/drugstore true crime novel filled with lurid pictures and speculation.  This is true crime as vehicle for social history, much like the books TJ English writes so wonderfully well.  In the opening of the book, a young woman's body is discovered - she is brutally, terribly, shockingly dead - the victim of unspeakable crime.  She is also British.  China is hounded by the Japanese, the world is on the brink of its second World War (or World War I - part II, as I like to describe the inevitable sequel), and the story makes headlines.<br /><br />Mr. French introduces us to the China of the period, but also offers insight into investigative techniques of the time, the way foreigners in Peking fit into the city (in their own quarters and without), the nature of diplomatic face saving, and a tantalizing glimpse in the Badlands - that sinful place of crime and debauchery.  He details the official investigation (where the crime went cold) and the unofficial investigation run by the victim's father (where the crime was solved).  Along the way were diplomats, Chinese students, European wastrels, prostitutes, pimps, petty thieves, rooming house denizens, and everything in-between.<br /><br />Midnight in Peking is a glimpse under the covers of Peking on its way to radical change as the friction between the old and new rub its edges raw.  Ostensibly about the murder of Pamela Werner and her father's fight to find justice for her, the book is at its best where it lingers on the fringes of polite society - jazz, brothels, and opium dens, oh my.  I would have liked more social history and less true crime, but overall an enjoyable read and winner of the Edgar Award for Best Fact Crime and the CWA Non-Fiction Dagger.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Upon loading my level 16 game, a prompt appears to download a new update to continue playing, even providing a download button to tap to initiate download. So I tap the button and get routed to the appstore, tap the open button next to the app and it rerouted me back to the game screen which says if I want to continue  playing I must download the update by tapping the provided download button.  It's an endless circle.  I'm angry and frustrated, my son and I really liked this game.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is a fun jewel type game where you need to match 3 or more of the colored gems to earn points.  The more you match,  the higher the score!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Very addictive.  9x9s are challenging.  Not much challenge in anything lower but it gets you used to the method for solving.
B00B8YSIMY|5.0|Get Clean is a gripping tale of a man's life spinning out of control and hitting rock bottom, yet there are shards and glimmers of the man inside fighting for hope of a better life. Drugs, dead-end jobs, illicit relationships and terrible \\"friends\\" drive the events, but the man inside still believes there can be something better.<br /><br />James Ross knows how to drive the story along and suck you into the crazy upside down life of a drug addict trying to \\"GET CLEAN\\". What's it like to hit bottom, James Ross, paints the moment vividly, \\"What the **** was I doing hanging out in pretentious clubs, selling drugs, being friends with a psychopath , with both of us infatuated with some bird who clearly has issues, as she can't tear herself away from a man who obviously doesn't want to commit?...`This isn't my home. These aren't my friends. It's time to go.'\\" Highly recommended.
B005LAII4E|4.0|It's entertaining, which is all I ask of a movie. If you have a couple of hours and need to fill it and like action movies then watch this one.
B00486070K|5.0|My laptop in my dorm wasn't getting internet very well with my school Wi-Fi and now I never have any problems so this adapter was, and is my life saver!
B008JFUO4U|4.0|It was entertaining, but didn't hold my interest as other movies do.  The story line, I found to be similar to several other movies
B000E6FSPW|5.0|all rocky tapes and records are great  enjoyed all movies and the sound tracks you  get to see the little guy come out on top
B0063GORYU|5.0|I need to be occupied  while at the hospital for a few hours and this is perfect alone with the other games I've purchased.<br />I really enjoy this solitaire.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This show is absolutely addictive! The drama is great, the legal stuff is fairly accurate, and you are left hanging after each episode wondering what will happen. It's pretty much a soap opera, but a well-done one with believable characters who you really care about.
1451695195|4.0|I liked it because it was written by a Dr. who was a nonbeliever until it happened to him. He will never be the same again.
B002PMPTIO|4.0|I loved this movie and watched it many times, the plot is exciting and keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B004ZH66XO|1.0|The movement and way you have to hold the phone to play the game is awkward to the point of impossible.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I prefer Google Search over Bing and resent it when some of the sights push you to use Bing.  Google for me gives me the sights I really want.
B002LC2DQ4|3.0|It's hard to rate something you never received. I'm not going to put down the seller or Amazon. I just want to put a warning out there to read the fine print and find out where the product is coming from. If it was clearly disclosed this was coming from China, I would not of bought it, because of customs problems and shipping time. I did get my money back, but also wasted almost two months waiting for it. So read the fine print and find out where your item is coming from because some sellers seem to be trying  to hide it.
B0094KT6J8|5.0|I love this Disney movie!  It is set in 1920s New Orleans, Louisiana and being from deep East Texas I really enjoyed the Shreveport reference.  I think this is the first Disney princess to be from a distinctive place--United States.  Mulan technically isn't a princess and Brave is in Scotland but was released after The Princess and the Frog.  But like Ariel, Aurora and the others I don't think they are ever given an extant geographical location--Once upon a time in a land far far away I guess lol
B00C5R8364|5.0|Good plot which moved along.  Characters were very believable.  He weaves many threads of the plot and brings them together at the  end
B003QSJDZQ|5.0|I love this movie it is so funny!  My mom really enjoyed it to during our layover for our next flight
B00FEN000S|1.0|this movie might be ok IF! i was 10. another syfy with bad acting and try's to be so serous which is not. all the aliens are somewhat the same. it almost feels like im watching a godzille movie made for a kid.
B001AFF25W|5.0|I love everything about this book!!!!! The abcd method is the first thing I'm going to do! I love this book!
B004I8WD7S|5.0|excellent product, i sent this to India 3 month back. But still it looks awsome. Even screen protector looks very nice.
B007FG9LIE|2.0|I put it down halfway through. I was not remotely believable. This was my first and last try with this aurthur.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This game keeps you thinking in a fun way. Like to play and unwind after work. Once you clear one picture you just want to solve it all.
6305128952|5.0|THIS ONE WAS A REAL TEARJERKER. A WINNER IN EVERY WAY!!! SUPERB MUSIC SCORE!!!<br />THIS ONE YOU WATCH OVER AND OVER!!! EACH TIME YOU BLUBBER~~~~~~
B00F35BV64|4.0|Nicely done, revisiting the past and breathing a fresh new spin on the series couldn't have enjoyed this movie much more
B00001W9G0|5.0|WHAT IS THERE NOT TO LOVE - STRIESAND AND REDFORD, TOGETHER!!!<br />THEY ARE AN IRRISISTABLE TEAM, FOR ALL TIMES!!! LOVELY!
B00BQ1D7BQ|4.0|Very good cd, very good quality muscianship, song interpretations and originals - do not let this one pass this one by.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I keep up with the weather in lots of places and I can do that with this app :) I also like the messages for storms.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I  read the The Shining when I was a kid and it took me 20 years to not go near an old hotel without a little bit of trepidation.  Although it was a great horror novel, The Shining was also about the repercussions of alcoholism and violent tendencies in a man.  Jack Torrance's bottoming out is accelerated by the ghosts around him and results in tragedy.  Doctor Sleep takes up the story of the little boy in The Shining where he is battling the same demons that killed his father.  In that sense, the novel is about a recovering alcoholic and puts a big wet sloppy kiss on the Alcoholics Anonymous program (the real hero of the book).  I found that just as fascinating as the suspenseful fight between the forces of evil and good that is always so central to a King novel.  As usual, a band of misfits come together to battle a relentless and seemingly formidable foe - in this case the fascinating True Knot - a new sort of monster that King has invented for this story (don't want to spoil it for you).  Couldn't put it down and teared up in the final chapter.  I'm going to have to pick up The Shining again (for the third time)!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this app more and more. I find I never have paper anymore so I grab my Kindle and take notes whenever I need it :) It also allows you to organize your notes so that they are easy to find.
B005COO1X6|4.0|I love Stephen King, so as a fan I liked it. Very short, so you can't REALLY get into it like most of his books.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|It's just like the real game! You can play alone or with other people. It makes you follow the rules to a &#34;T.&#34;
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I am getting a notification from the Ice Age app that I need to install the new update.  I have not been able to do so on my Kindle Fire HD.  The apps update is not showing one for Ice Age.  Any suggestions?
B0052GACNM|5.0|I got the set of these cd's so I wouln't miss any of this music. That was a great idea.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|Nice plot with enough twists and turns to keep it interesting. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys police suspense.
0307950689|3.0|Dan Brown has been categorised as commercial fiction and I'm not embarrassed to admit that I enjoy reading this genre. I loved Angels and Demons as well as The Da Vinci Code. So I'm not to sure why it took me four years to getting around to read The Lost Symbol! I'm not too sorry it did either. Personally I found it wasn't as good Brown's previous books for a few reasons. Firstly, at over 500 hundred pages, it was long. Too long. By the end of the book I had almost forgotten what the point of the book was. Information overload. Secondly. I didn't like the way the information was presented either. Monuments and places were described at the beginning of many chapters in a text book like fashion which really broke the flow of the story for me. At other times, I felt like I was sitting in on a lecture. Also, having a fanatic at the heart of the story was just too similar to his other books, I found myself sighing with frustration. However, there were points about the book I did like. I enjoyed continuing to learn about religion and symbols as well as be introduced to the Noetic Sciences and Invisible College. All this is through Robert Langdon. He is such a likeable character, despite the many bizarre situations he finds himself in! The next book in the series, Inferno, is out but I'm not in a rush to get to it when there were so many problems with this one for me.
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|This parody is brilliant. It's amazingly &#34;in the know&#34; about the Star Trek show, and does an excellent job of lampooning the silly while holding a great respect for its referred source material. Plus, the one-liners and quotables throughout are absolutely hilarious. (Tim Allen does a GREAT Kirk.)<br /><br />If you haven't seen this, you should. If you have, then I hope you love it as much as I do. Never give up, never surrender!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is such a food and entertaining show.  It must have been before it's time because I really don't see why it was cancelled. If they ever decide to make more, count me in as a fan.
1567184855|4.0|I intend to do more shopping for the holidays the efficient shipping and handling is impressive<br />I needed to speak to a customer service and was satisfied
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|Easy to play, no problems downloading & lots of fun. I don't bother looking at permissions so can't help you there
B00CZAYL76|3.0|I like Five Finger Death Punch,  and enjoy the music on thIs disc - but honestly it doesn't sound much different than their previous stuff,  wedding is both comforting and annoying,  depending on my mood. What keeps me from rating this any higher is that the lyrics are stupid. Seriously, they've been sophmoric at best on past albums (especially American Capitalist), but they're just plain dumb in this album. And what is with all the guest singers?  I'll tell you what is up with it,  5FDP is running out of ideas, both original and borrowed.<br /><br />Love the guitars and heavy drums, and would give this four stars if I could get it without the vocal track.
B000ICZD4I|5.0|All actresses and actors very funny. The small town feel was shown in the caf&eacute; scenes. Kathy Bates, who was in Misery, was acting like a comedian. There is some adult and suggestive subjects, so best for adults to screen first before showing to youngsters.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|This movie was a good movie, and was great in 3D. The story line had good content and some interesting twists. The end was the best twist of them all.
B0035JNTA6|3.0|It was that dreary I really cant remember much about the film. What more can I say i wouldn't watch it again
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Was good. Entertaining, slow paced at times but good reading. Don't think this is one of his better books but would recommend reading. Hadn't read a Grisham book in awhile so was pleasantly surprised.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Brutally Funny and heart warming. Written from the mans perspective. This book draws you in from the first sentence and keeps you hooked until the last word
1476729085|5.0|*I received an ARC copy via goodreads first reads*<br />5 Stars!<br />I am not writing a synopsis for this one. I am assuming that if you have made it this far that you have already read a description (maybe two) and mine would just be a waste of words.<br />I Loved This Book! I would like to find a tall building and yell it at the top of my lungs but seeing as how I live on a military installation that could turn out to be chaotic. First of all let me say that I did relate to the main character, Don Tillman, so much that it was a little concerning but also very funny.  These characters are brilliant! Even with their glaringly obvious differences they all fit together perfectly and just make sense. I saw a lot of my relationships in theirs as well which was enlightening actually.  I could go on for pages about the character relationships. Laughter was like an automatic organ function and even with the book closed I can recall something and chuckle.  I gave up sleep for this book and sleep is something I don't give up too easily.  There are not a lot of books I keep for the sake of reading again and again but this one has been added to that collection. Seeing as how this review makes no sense I will end it.<br />It's very obvious that I have had a personal experience with this novel but I think it will be just enjoyable for others and I encourage all of you to read it.
B00EB6ENXO|4.0|Good movie. Hopefully not the last. Leaves you longing for another movie or at least the second Avengers. But that's a long wait.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Such a wonderful book. My 10-year-old read this and loved it. He kept insisting that I also read it and am I glad I did. Such a beautiful story of love and acceptance but told in a light hearted way. The world would be a better place if we all were friends with an \\"Auggie.\\"
0316204366|1.0|I am always stunned that readers still think that Gladwell's books are anything more than entertainment. I spend so much time trying to teach undergraduates critical thinking skills that are undermined by this type of book.
B00C81LYH2|4.0|Very pretty face and gown. She could have used a purse or bracelet to go with outfit. Maybe a hair adornment. Silver was done about three years ago, so kind of repetitive.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|What can say about a very funny dysfunctional cave family - except it is great fun for the whole family.<br /><br />You should see it or we will &#34;Release the Baby&#34;
B00BWYFTNG|5.0|Love my set....had read on other reviews that Daryl didn't look like 'Daryl' but on this set, he is fairly realistic...Merle is great.  Can't get the hunting knife into the knife holder on Daryl (oh well) but still love my guys :)<br /><br />Item purchased through TVMERCH here on AMAZON
B008Y212PI|4.0|some of the puzzles. seemed like you had to use a hint.  overall it is a fun puzzle game.  the pictures don't look anything like the puzzles
0756665949|4.0|I got this as a Christmas present for my brother who loves everything about LOST. His only complaint: He already knows everything in the encyclopedia that's worth knowing. (After reading it more, he changed his mind.)
B00F91H15W|4.0|Seems to catch the essence of the empty lives it explores. Amazing that these kids got away with their crime spree as long as they did. Performances are very good. I like Coppola's directing. Very faced pace and neat camera work. Well edited.
B00594XOZU|1.0|IT won't let me log in. Please fix it. I have been using this app forever and it used to be a really good one. But then it turned on me. Every time I try to log in it says:this is taking than it should. Try again later.: please fix this somebody!!!!!!
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Worth a view but probably not a repeater. Aside from the ocassional rainbow and unicorn moments depicting an all-too-perfect family, this was an interesting take on the contageon concept.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|i enjoy the app but having more annoying noises would make it great and easier to wake up to and the sound is not loud enough
B00B89LZ4C|4.0|Just received this figure today after purchasing it a couple days after the Breaking Bad finale.  It was packaged well and, while some people may like to keep theirs in the box, I opened mine immediately.<br /><br />It feels good in your hand and seems very well made.  One minor complaint is that the head/body proportions seem...off somehow.  But I can get over that.  The hat and glasses are removable, and the figure comes with a duffel bag of money and a baggie of blue meth.  Fun.  The gun you see in his right hand is not removable, just so you're aware.<br /><br />Some have mentioned the figure is difficult to stand up.  Being unable to move the arms and legs probably doesn't make that easier.  But I haven't had much trouble myself.  However, it is easier if he's not holding the duffel bag.  Still, I've made it work.<br /><br />Overall, the Walter White-Heisenberg figure looks cool and I am happy with the purchase.  The $17.99 price is worth it. in my opinion, and seeing it up on my shelf takes a bit of the edge off missing the show.  If you're looking for a cool piece of memorabilia from Breaking Bad, I would recommend this figure to you.<br /><br />All Hail the King!
B005LAIIMG|1.0|Got the movie in the mail and could not get the movie to play.  Trouble shot the computer and dvd drive with other movies and they all worked.  Serving in Afghanistan makes it hard to call Amazon or return a package.  My DVD player will not recognize the disc and play the movie.  Have to give the Amazon folks a 0 for making it hard to return because it has been opened...couldn't find the place where I could contact them to remedy this issue.  Won't be ordering any more movies from Amazon in the near future...wasted $20+ dollars to get a plasticcase and a fubar'd disc.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game is really fun, with mini games that make you want to play more! The mystery keeps you guessing!
147674355X|5.0|Wow, what an amazing soul touching, heartbreaking book!<br />I found myself literally crying at times with what Sky had to endure and even how everything came out in the open in the end.<br />Reconnecting with her childhood friend and what was lost on so many emotional levels.<br />Her flashbacks and not remembering so many years of her life. What a truly, amazingly well written story line.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I CAN NOT wait for the movie to come out!!! This book is very intense.. lol in a good way!
B004EPZ06G|1.0|If you have seen the first movie, there is absolutely no reason to see this one.  It's the exact same movie except it's set in Thailand instead of Las Vegas.  It reuses the same jokes, and the writers felt that they needed to make constant references and recreations of the first movie.  Watching this movie was a waste of my time and electricity.  Anyone who has seen the first Hangover movie and has the mental capacity to read what I'm writing will not find this movie to be enjoyable.  If you're thinking about buying this, don't.  Buy the first one and watch it twice instead.
B00D6DVSAE|1.0|A true disappointment.<br /><br />I thought the music was poor.  There were some vulgar lyrics, and didn't find any of the tracks enjoyable.<br />As a Sting fan since 1984, I'll just say that he has fallen a long way.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game but am a little aggravated right now. It won't let me play until I download an upgrade, but it won't let me download the upgrade.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|The worst acting that I've ever seen out of Leo DiCaprio.  Not a very good movie. I spent most of the time wishing it would hurry up and end.
B00F35BV64|2.0|This film rests entirely on the laurels of the previous decades of Star Trek fans.  The plot is lazy and unbelievable.  The characters don't grow to trust each other, they just love each other as life long friends do.  It was fine for Kirk to mourn the loss of his friend Spock in &#34;Wrath,&#34; because he was at the end of his career and with a man whom he worked intimately for most of it.  Here Spock mourns Kirk, I guy he doesn't really like and hardly knows and despite his Vulcan emotional flatness because why?  Because the producers want a reference to &#34;Wrath.&#34;  For Shame.
B004JHY8A8|5.0|Loved this book. it opened my eyes to an  episode of history that I had never known. This book has left a deep impression on me and I found Tatianas historical references  incredibly accurate.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|50 Shades is one thing but this is the novel that needs more attention.  I couldn't put it down.  Waiting on the next one to come out.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Easy yet challenging at higher levels. I enjoy the pictures that are the final outcome of the puzzle. One thing I don't care for is when you start a tutorial you have to complete it to get out f it
B004P8JPS6|4.0|I started reading the Jack Reacher series at 61 Hours so I didn't have years of Reacher under my belt. More like weeks. I enjoyed this story of how Reacher became a nomad. How he left the Army and how I honestly never know who to trust in Child's books!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|If you wanna have a good time rent this movie, it has everything you want and the fun part is theres is magic.
B004AQR29C|3.0|I PURCHASED THIS MOVIE AS A RENTAL AND FOUND THE VIDEO QUALITY TO BE NOT VERY GOOD.<br />I CONTINUED TO GET A BUFFERING WHEEL. I RESTARTED THE MOVIE NUMEROUS TIMES IN ORDER TO COMPLETE MY VIEWING.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely adore this game! The fact that it's free just makes it even more awesome! Bananas and bapples and Minions, OH MY!!!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Great movie my wife & kids loved it too. Mr. Scott made my son and daughter laugh out loud. A must see.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Obsessed with Pinterest for any and all ideas, so having the app conveniently on my phone just perfect. Love it!
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|It's ablast to play on a tablet ...no problems. Its all fair so everybody can enjoy. ..it. watch out for sniper activities....and choppers that are hard to pinpoint....
B000068GA4|5.0|I knew one Danzig song before I bought this album, and it was \\"Mother\\". I listened to a few samples off this album, and being in the mood for something bluesy, I bought this album. Wow. I did not expect this to become one of my all time favorite albums. The day it arrived, I played it start to finish four times in my stereo. Now what makes the album so good? Simple. Danzig keeps it simple. This is hard rock with an awesome blues overtone, apparent on several songs. The fifth track, \\"I'm the One\\" is a completely acoustic blues track. All of the songs are so damn catchy! Every song has a memorable chorus, and I've had \\"Tired of Being Alive\\" on loop in my head ever since I got the album. Seriously, if you enjoy hard rock, pick up this album! Glenn really made a winner here. What an underrated album. Standout tracks: Snakes of Christ (Danzig swears up and down that my all time favorite band, Stone Temple Pilots, ripped off the riff for their song Sex Type Thing. While the riffs are similar, I don't think STP ripped Danzig off.), Killer Wolf, Tired of Being Alive, Her Black Wings, and Devil's Plaything. Enjoy this criminally underrated masterpiece of hard rock with a healthy dose of blues thrown in to boot!
B001A5HBAG|5.0|I needed some shows to watch on a long flight so I downloaded the first season.  It got me hooked and I had a hard time finding time to watch all the newer seasons since I was 6 seasons behind and the episodes are about 47 minutes and there is about 13 episodes per season.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really enjoyed Downton Abbey, I just finished season 3 and I cannot wait until season 4 is out.  Many of the storylines are a bit predictable, but who doesn't love being right and the build up of suspense when you can't believe they are really going to do what is hinted is great!  There are many interesting storylines that have run throughout the previous series with exciting developments in this season, I particularly enjoyed the transitions of Thomas, although the Bates and Anna story line is getting a bit old.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|So great!! My youngest son is crazy about Legos and even crazier about Minecraft!! This set is totally worth what I paid for it. In fact, the Minecraft Lego Village Set is selling for about $20 more than the price I bought the original, and that will be worth it too, if its anywhere near as great as this one. What a great toy!! I would recommend this to anyone who loves Lego sets or Minecraft!!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|The grandchildren and I enjoy the game but we can only go to Level 32 and we cannot go further. It tells us to download more and I try but can't get it to work.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I Loved the game. It was Not really hard. It keeps you busy for a while. Can't wait for the next.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I am absolutely love it!  I ordered The Lost Hero (Heroes of Olympus) on Amazon Kindle Fire! Thanks for the order.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|Best show ever !  My wife and I were looking for a good show to watch at night together the show is so good we can't stop watching the show. It's awesome.....
B007SYWFRM|2.0|Love this game would be 5 stars but since the newest update all I get is a screen stating I need update. and when I click on download it brings.me to the app page. But no update to download. I better not lose my babies that should be ready to hatch but I can't get on to play.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|It was exactly what I wanted, and in very good condition.  I love the music from this soundtrack and score.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|My son loves this game. Better than the first one. It has fun angry bird videos to watch. Great game!
B00ARI9CDQ|1.0|The whole reason I like the daily mail is the layout and the variety. This app takes all that away. The article titles are cut off so that the whole description is not available.  I have to open each article to get the whole description. And then if I want a specific article I have to search through the topics to find it. Going to uninstall and go back to the the regular presentation. Improve the app and maybe I will try it
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Fascinating show.  Interesting characters, great acting, and good story lines. Can't wait until season 3 is available to watch on Amazon Prime videos.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|Not my usual taste but I liked it enough to read the next one. I'm interested enough to want to find out who America will choose, the Prince or adorn?
B002AWX6UM|5.0|Israel's story is compellingly strong from the first page.  I couldn't put the book down.  I am hopeful if enough people read this book the hopes for Sierra Leone as a country to never repeat it's past and in the near future raise the economy for the people of this country.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Good alarm clock, nice and loud, only complaint is dismiss button should be same size as snooze button.  Love the math option.  Also, for some reason, if I want to switch the ringtone, I can't listen to a preview of what it sounds like - no sound comes out.  Other than that, it definitely provides what it claims.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Love the show love the actors and it's still on the air so you no it's good if you like court shows you will like this one
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|after trying a few of these so called free g5 games, i usually just play the first ACTUALLY FREE level and forget about it. 5$ is a hefty price for a game app. i would buy more g5 games if they were the more common $2.99, but i really loved everything about this one. the music, the scenery, &amp; the sound was great!. also im a horror movie fan, &amp; this game has some pleasant little pop up in your face scares. the reason for 4 stars is for some reason sometimes at start-up it freezes. it may take up to a good five minutes and sometime a shut-down &amp; restart of my tablet to get going. not sure if its the game or my tablet, but once i get it up &amp; running its a really neat game!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|A must read for all women. As a working mom it was great but I wish I had read it 5 years ago!
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|It was a good story, but not one I couldn't put down.  At times I got confused trying to follow it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Chromecast is the first (of many?) device built on the GoogleCast specification for media transmittal. What Chromecast affords you that other streaming receivers do not is the ability to start a stream on another computing device and then hand it off to the Chromecast. For instance, if you start up Netflix on your iPad then toss it over to the Chromecast, your iPad is NOT streaming the media any more; you're free to do other things on your iPad. This handoff protocol is something that's been missing from streaming and this spec and device can be a real potential game changer. Super easy to use and set up. Big fan.
B0083Z614S|4.0|I enjoyed the book but it is unlikely to appeal to men.<br />An easy read and a gentle story: something different.
B0000AOV85|4.0|Some good insights for lovers of Pink Floyd. Good interviews but could have done with a little more concert footage.
0985557834|5.0|I now have both volumes. Both are full of fantastic projects. My friends and I are really enjoying making items to sale at flea markets from both of them.
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|I'm not one to write reviews for everything I read, but when I finish a book as fantastic as this one, I just have to put fingers to the keyboard.<br /><br />The story is well paced, compelling and suspenseful.  Wonderfully researched and tied together it was sad to get to the end.  The journey through the mind and motivations of a secret agent, and the hunt for his elusive prey had me turning pages late into the night.  The characters were well developed and empathy flowed for almost all of them - regardless of which side of the fence they were on.<br /><br />Terrific work Terry - can hardly wait for your next book.
B00594XOZU|1.0|i love kik it used to work great . but now its not letting me log in or create a new account -.- :( its taking forever to load ... its getting really annoying now : 
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|It allows one to inner reflect and connect with your inner self and challenge some beliefs that have limited us throughout life!
B003KVKQB4|5.0|She brings together all the global threads with remarkable intellectual panache. A must-read.<br />With a long list of references too.
B005USZYDU|5.0|This is a great book.  Anyone who buys this book will love it.  Especially if you or your parent is a lawyer.
0321934962|5.0|My Nikon D7100 manual fully explains what and where the camera settings are, but Mr.Batdorff's book explains why. I have only just begun to explore the possibilities with this camera, and this book is a must have for anyone who owns this camera. We made quite an investment in the equipment and this book will help you get the most from your investment.
B00AHDXTIK|3.0|Connector was very loose and would not keep my iPhone 5 connected for very long.<br />Great communication though making the return easy.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|This riveting series continues with a second season even better than the first.  Danes and Lewis won Emmys for this work.  Well deserved.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|The flow of this game is good . I like this game and it is fun to play and u will spend hours playing it
B0062CTYRA|5.0|I can't believe I did not review this book ealier. I read it several years ago and it remains a favorite. I write reviews for a local newsletter and this book was one that I highly recommended. No recap here, you can get that from the professional reviewers. Great book. Keeps you guessing until the end.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|Great vocals, great set, great cast, really just an excellent performance of the phantom. So glad I stumbled upon this DVD
B0029EDMEG|4.0|Decent for a TV movie. Good enough to make me want to watch the follow up movies. Potential to be boring since it's yet another stressed out cop plot but this one is different enough to overcome that. Plus it has Tom Selleck, who wears the character well.
B001BANK32|5.0|Stephen King you are phenomenal. I keep thinking you just cannot keep topping the last book of yours that I have read.  But yo do. I am such a fan. I had to reread the shining for two reasons.  First, because I have not read it since it originally came out, and secondly because I purchased Doctor Sleep. I will be returning shortly with my review on Doctor Sleep. Thank you for your writings Mr. King.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I enjoyed this book overall. The pain of reading Jamie`s past was a bit harsh and was uncomfortable. I am so glad the ending provided closure and warmth.
0684857219|4.0|Loved the book. It contained some much useful information. The only reason that it is not 5 stars is the book fell apart after the second day, which sucks but other than that it's a great read
086571701X|5.0|This book has all teh basics and big ideas to get you started on your aquaponics system. It is definitly worth the money!
0060589469|5.0|I'd been wanting to read this book again, thought I had two copes but could notfind it in my apartment.It amazes me to see how relevant it still is.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|As I was reading this beautiful, imaginative and expansive novel, I couldn't help but be reminded of the Jane Austin novels, with their wonderful and varied female characters.  But the scientific and exploratory aspects kept making me think of Charles Darwin, even though we don't meet him until the near end of the novel.  There is a bit of Barbara Kingsolver here, too, in the author's respectful scientific rigor.  I was mesmerized and read it straight through.  Can't recommend it Highly enough!
B008YUHQ3M|5.0|I have this movie in 2D but bought it in 3D hoping it would be better and I wasn't disappointed.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|Being an avid reader and a movie lover, I learned long ago to divorce the two. I tend to look upon them as being related but not the same. This allows me to enjoy one or the other, both or neither; but based solely on each version. If you have read the book and are thinking of seeing the movie, (or vice versa), I suggest you look at them as being related.<br />The movie is intense and well made. It is fast and heavy action with less gore than I expected. The zombies are freaky creepy. The zombie ant hill gives me nightmares. The acting was good. I'm not a huge Brad Pitt fan so his being a pretty boy made no difference to me. I think he did well and was believable. Overall I enjoyed the thrills and chills. I vote it up for a good time and will watch it multiple times. I like the uncut version better though really there is not that much difference. I really only noted the chase through the alley as being the easiest difference to spot; in the uncut version it is longer and more intense. In my opinion, definitely worth having.<br />I enjoy the multiple ways to watch in this package and believe it to be the best deal. But them my family uses all the various ways of watching.
B00C28J2VQ|3.0|I bought this because it was in 3D and I'm trying to build a 3D library.  The movie followed the usual action formula so I got what I expected.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|Beautifully crafted story about a college freshman and her twin sister as they struggle to overcome abandonment and codependency issues. They walk a fine line between self sabotage and escaping from reality through their fan fiction stories. Both sisters have their own way of coping with their absent mother and mentally ill father as they figure out how to deal with life. The author draws a parallel between fan fiction characters and our loveable, lead character  Cath, in an clever and entertaining, coming of age story you won't want to miss.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This game is just great, and the best part is it's free! It's maybe the best free racing game there is.
B002RV01QI|5.0|I just love anything by Enya and this is a great CD. My wife heard one of her songs on NCIS and loved it, so i ordered it for her.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|In a graphically gui way battery HD takes the abysmal default kindle fire power settings and provides emasculated detail describing by task how long your battery will hold 5 stars hands down.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|I love war/love story movies.  It is also based on true historical events (the French and Indian war). The two main characters have asked of chemistry together
B005KIQDYE|4.0|I bought this as a gift for my Niece. My older Daughter loved Legos so I am happy to pass the torch to my Niece.
B007P3TMW2|5.0|In the beginning, this movie has you wondering what it's all about.  But then you reach that moment of clarity and it makes every second of the wondering worthwhile.  I loved it and will watch it over and over again.
1480564044|5.0|I read this book back when it first came out and has continued to be one of my favorite book series of all time.  It's definitely a classic and worth the read if you like any kind of fantasy novels.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|So many of my questions were answered.  I need to go back and read the power of now, Eckhart Tolle's other book
B00CL0J99K|5.0|I have enjoyed the series so far and had to have the latest for my own. Iron Man rocks with fun for the whole family on a great family night.
0547366205|5.0|We love the story in this book as well as the adorable little baby illustrations.  It's a nice one to read to a little one and touch their fingers and toes as you read about them, or show your fingers and point to your toes to help get those concepts into their vocabulary.  I have this as the paperback but I would recommend the board book bc it would probably be easier to handle with a little one on your lap and trying to demonstrate fingers and toes.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Classic must have for all those who enjoyed the series. Great video quality and of course the drama is awesome to watch.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|this is so lagy that I cant even tap on my dinosaurs in a code red storm.because it lags so much that its made the game unresponsive
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Classic movie for me and had to have for myself. Enjoyed the effects and look forward to seeing more in the future. Check it out for yourself.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|Great movie can't wait for a fourth one already  own 1,2 and now 3 plus the adventures and hulk and Capt. America and Thor
B005LAIIN0|5.0|This movie was good. Not what I expected but kept me interested until the end. Enjoy it for yourself and prepare to be Zombified!
B0059WTMLW|5.0|My husband tears SUDOKU out of magazines and newspapers whenever he sees it.  He's also uses Sudoku books and systematically finishes them.  This was something he really loved using on the airplane.  It is \\"just right\\".
B005LAII4E|5.0|GI JOE is awesome. Had to have for the home and it certainly lived up to the expectation. Enjoy for yourself.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|My grand-daughters ages 3 & 5 absolutely love this ap.  The characters are so cute and they do so many things in the kitchen.  The kids can make a pizza, a smoothy, pudding, stir fry veggies, apple pie.  They learn how to chop with a knife.  Make shih-ka-bobs for fondu.  And then when done they clean up the table and wash the dishes.  It is an excellent ap.  ALL of the Dr. Panda aps are so worth the $$  Highly recommend.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|why wont it load for me? I'm waisting my dads WIFI and even I'm not happy right now 'cause of this crap
B007PVHMCG|4.0|My son loves minecraft and Legos. This was a perfect gift. I thought it might be a little bigger, but he absolutely loves it.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|I found it almost funny that Jack Reacher, known for his size.  He is a large man and fit is now played by Tom Cruise a short, fit man.  It's ok if you don't read the books.  When I heard of the producer's casting ro Tom Cruise in the role the image of his fighting for his life against a band of renegade munchkins came to mind.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was excellent - I could not put it down - It was suspenseful and also so well written
B00EVRHE8E|4.0|'Fangirl' reminded me what it was like to be a eighteen-year-old girl when everything was new and intimidating. This book does a wonderful job of getting into the mind of a young woman who has suddenly had to leave everything comfortable from her childhood behind and is forced to move forward into adulthood without losing her sense of self. This is something that every young woman has to contend with, and it was fascinating to watch Cath try to deal with everything.<br /><br />Being transported back to that uncomfortable teenage place was enjoyable, and I would recommend it to any older teenager or woman in her twenties or thirties who may have forgotten how utterly horrible being a teenager out of her comfort zone is.<br /><br />The actual 'fangirl' element was interestingly navigated. I feel that anyone who has been deeply engaged in a fandom will recognise elements of Cath's obsession. Although, as an avid 'fangirl' myself, I'm not sure I can be fully on board with how Cath seemed to only use her fandom-involvement as an emotional crutch in difficult times. It does fit the character, but it doesn't represent everyone.<br /><br />Overall, this was an interesting, fun and really quite realistic coming-of-age story.
B00F91G5BS|5.0|This movie starts fast and doesn't stop.  Special effects are top notch.  Acting is very good. I wish I would have seen it in the theater instead of my puny 55 inch TV.
B005AKFXZW|5.0|Often when I hear many people rave about a book I am reluctant to try it. Finally, when a very trusted book-obsessed friend recommended this book, and I could get it on Kindle, I took the plunge. It was so worth it.<br /><br />From the very beginning, this book envelopes the reader in a kind of fantastic dream-like atmosphere. The description is so vivid or sights, sounds and smells that you really do begin to feel that you inhabit the world of the book. The characters are wonderfully imagined, and you are pulled along with gusto as you never know what's around the corner.<br /><br />Marvelously imagined, completely unique and definitely one to read and re-read!
B00479SVBU|5.0|We used this player on our trip to Washington, D.C. area.  We did not have any problems and I was very pleased with the sound and ease of use.  Very well worth the money
B003M6EAXM|4.0|This is a awesome series. The only problem is amazon prime HD player needs some work. It stutters for HD play but not SD. Get it fixed Amazon an you have a five star product here.
