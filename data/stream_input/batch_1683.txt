B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great book. It has a slow start but gets really good toward the middle.I think its one of the best book in his series! It has very good detail.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read on average forty books a year, and can honestly say that the \\"Wool\\" series is one of the best that I have read over the past decade. I did not want to put this book down, always telling myself \\"I'll just read one more chapter...\\". Alas, life must go on, but at least I have volumes six and seven to look forward to; and, like others have said, I look forward to many more tales in Mr. Howey's universe!
B007THA4FI|3.0|I was disappointed in the book. It was long and boring and the story line was way out there and difficult to follow.It was not up to her standard of holding ones interest.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|A Five Star movie.  Absolutely - however I will be the first to acknowledge that this has it's own unique niche audience, and won't be for everyone.  This is a love letter to the movies of the late 70's and 80's, the movie of Zemeckis, Dante and yes, most of all Spielberg.  For in this feature J.J. Abrams has created a love letter to Spielberg's era of moviemaking, a movie that both celebrates and emulates the styles and tools, the moviemaking grammar, and particularly the tone of movies from that era.<br />It's all that, but still wrapped in a story, one that has a set of familiar elements, but wrapped up in a new enough arrangement.  A bunch of kids in 1979 bond while making home movies with their Super 8 camera.  They are filming one night when they witness a terrible train crash.. but when the dust settles, there is something from the cargo of the train that has been released, and it is about to have a major impact on the town.  Scratch beneath that relatively simple skin though, and you'll find elements of the Goonies (bunch of kids coming of age through shared adventure), Close Encounters (paranoia, alien contact affecting ordinary small town folk), Gremlins (the black humour), and E.T. (adolescents coming of age in damaged families). And if this is an homage to Spielberg, then it's earlier Spielberg - the guns, deaths and occasional mild swear words aren't airbrushed out. It is very much a story first and foremost about real kids, living real lifes, and much less about the fantastic events happening around them.  Yes there is spectacle towards the end, but only as a pay off to the emotional journey of the characters.. if it's just the action or effects you want, you will likely be disappointed.  In fact, if there is any off note in the movie, it is the appearance of cgi - a very modern tool to tell an old fashioned story, and taking you out of the nostalgia trip somewhat. But it's not enough to derail the journey.<br />It's not just the director; the look, the feel of the movie, down through sets, period detail and even the musical score, also celebrate that early 80's feel.  And let's not forget those lead roles - kids who actually come across as real, likeable, believable - the scenes where they have to emote, particularly Elle Fanning, are amazingly genuine, and the relationship between the leads is handled in a delicate way which uses visuals and acting more than it does clunky exposition or awkward dialogue.<br />So yes, it is my own personal 5 stars.. Maybe it's too nostalgic to appeal to today's kids, maybe its too much about kids to appeal to today's adults.  But for me, I am just at that age that when I was young and impressionable it was Spielberg and Dante and the rest that stirred my own passion for movies, that made that first mark, that created those moments that would be my first love of cinema.. and it is precisely that feeling that has been captured and celebrated here.  This is what happens when movies about kids are made by mature filmmakers.  Watching it, I felt like that young wide eyed kid in the cinema again, and it was a glorious feeling.
B0019IMVDG|5.0|Great Vegas/Gangster movie.  I've seen it several times and I still enjoy it very much.  It is quite gruesome at some points, so I would not recommend it for kids.  A must see for sure!
B002LB7S10|3.0|The story was good, but it didn't seem authentic to me.  Was that a remake of the original?  If so, I wuold rather see the original.  I thought that young gal that was the main actress was the only good actor in the movie.  Sorry, just was kind of an average movie.  I guess I thought it was going to be more like the movie with Mickey Roark and Anthony Hopkins where he holds the family hostage in their home.

B005H5H3LW|4.0|Space Battleship Yamato is a live-action based on the well known classic anime. This movie suffers from the highly compressed storyline rate (26 episodes reduced to a 2 hours movie) and a extremely grim atmosphere at times. Overall, I don't regret buying this movie, but I got it for $12 on Amazon. However, if you really want to enjoy it, it helps if you lower your expectation from the anime that inspired it.<br /><br />The visual effects on this movie are amazing, and for the first time, you can see the Space Battleship Yamato come alive. The fighters on combat scenes are also a sight to beholds.<br /><br />Some characters were modified; having more women serving on the Yamato this time around. Yuki is depicted as an Ace pilot instead of a nurse and Dr Sato as a female doctor. Analyzer starts out as a pda like device, but literally jumps out as a battle robot at a crucial point of the movie. Finally, the Gamilas are now depicted as energy beings who belongs to a Borg-like society.<br /><br />The movie starts out with a grim atmosphere, portraying a defeated humanity. However, it doesn't lighten up a bit even as the mission progresses against all odds. This is in contrast with the anime series, where comic relief balanced the seriousness of their mission.<br /><br />Overall, I like this film despite its few pitfalls, or maybe because of them. If you hold your knowledge about the anime, you may find a very entertaining sci-fi film.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|I was looking for a gripping new series to sink my teeth into and delirium did not disappoint.  In fact it stole my whole weekend because i couldn't put it down.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I hadn't read this book in over 20 years, and it was like re-connecting with an old childhood friend. A book that anyone with a Tom Sawyer within will enjoy. It's a free digital product now, so there are no excuses not to read it!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Not within King's normal range of horror genre, but if you've kept up with his work, you'll notice a lot of ties to his other works (The Tower Series, It). Definitely worth a read!

B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I'm one of those who love Nicholas Sparks' stories. You know going in that the ending will be bittersweet; everything will not be perfect. This is one of those tales.
0307269752|3.0|\\"Millennium Trilogy\\" begins as \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" focuses on journalist Mikael Blomkvist and the fascinating Lisbeth Salander.  The periphery plot involving a court case Blomkvist loses encourages him to accept a covert assignment of solving a 40 year old murder by writing the Vanger family history.  The family is fairly large, at times providing information much of which is not used other than to overwhelm.<br /><br />It was a slow start but the ending satisfied the time spent.  Having watched the American based movie first somewhat ruined the surprise however I'm anxious to find out more about Salander in the following novels.  I'll more than likely watch the Swedish movies afterward.<br /><br />Thank you.
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|My husband and I both loved this movie - my interpretation is that it's a look at love when you were 12 as remembered and romanticized when you are 40.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I purchased this book when I first got my kindle a few months ago but did not read this one right away. I am so sorry I didn't, this book and the characters captivated me beyond my expectations. Rarely do I read a book that I give a full 5 stars to, even if I don't write a review about it.<br /><br />Wonderfully well written!
B009DQQF7Y|4.0|I like Explosions in the Sky and appreciate some of the less bombastic work of Mono, but I've often wondered whether the spirit of experimental rock in the 1990's, that helped give rise to what was later dubbed Post-rock, has been somewhat lost by the sort of music the Texas four piece and its Post-rock contemporaries have been making throughout the last ten years. To paraphrase a quote from Tiny Mix Tapes \\"Is Post-rock about stretching the possibilities of the live rock band, or delivering the emotional peaks and crescendos of the classical orchestra circa high-romanticism, with the economy of a touring punk band?\\" Godspeed You! Black Emperor is often seen as being one of the bands that turned Post-rock into something of an unrestrained spectacle in the late nineties. Their mixture of abstract vocal samples; lengthy movements and Slint indebted crescendo/diminuendo dynamics, basically shaped the landscape for what the genre would become in the 2000's.<br /><br />If it weren't for the fact that Godspeed released several masterworks in this style before going on a ten year hiatus, they perhaps could be blamed for the lack-lustre state in which post-rock currently finds itself in. Of course it would be churlish of us to ridicule GY!BE for having such a strong influence on the bands that followed them, their amazingly apocalyptic music was far too powerful not to invite imitators. It's just a shame that nobodies been able to take that inspiration (beside Sigur Ros) and produce anything as forward thinking/genre defining as what the Canadian Octet were able to do before retiring indefinitely. When I heard GY!BE had reformed in 2010 I was veritably pleased (as you could imagine), but I didn't think they'd release any new material, at least not in what has become a terribly clichéd form anyway. I was wrong, on both counts. Godspeed have adorned us with their fourth studio album and it's exactly how you'd expect a post-rock record to sound like in 2012, except from the fact that it isn't predictable and boring. Far from that, it's actually rather sublime and pretty much single-handedly redeems/exposes the derivative and unimaginative work that has been posturing as experimental rock during GY!BE's absence.<br /><br />\\"'Allejuah! Don't Bend! Ascend!\\" opens with a 20 minute leviathan by the name of Mladic, It's starts with an ominously slow build-up of treated violin's, distorted guitars and bass, before transforming into a blaring assault of metallic dissonance. As an opener, it's about as punishing as anything I've heard all year. The other beast on 'Allejuah ... is \\"We Drift Like Worried Fire,\\" a constantly changing suite of, hellacious drumming, feedback, plucked and distorted guitars, and ineffable strings. The intensity of this track generates a gamut of emotions throughout its 20 plus minute playing time, the first half of the track has the elegiacally uplifting feel of Broken Social Scene at their most expressive,  whilst the second half mainly gives way to adrenalin fuelled alt rock and aggressively frightening industrial noise. The Two Drone Pieces that seperate the aforementioned tracks \\"Their Helicopters Sing\\" and \\"Strung Like Lights Thee Pretemps Erable\\" aren't to be overlooked as ambient noodling. They're a deadly mixture of intense cacophony and abrasive electronic noises that help to maintain the punishing feel of this record.  Taken as whole `Allejuah is as uncompromising as anything Godspeed have previously released and in virtue of that last statement it's also just as essential to listen to.
B008FQ1O1K|5.0|This is indeed a thought provoking story.  Inspires one to think about time wasting pursuits and perhaps reassess how we use our time.  Highly recommended as compulsory reading.

B001B1UO6W|5.0|The original Child's Play is an all-time Horror classic! At the time when this movie first came out,you had Freddy and Jason getting all the bloody credit,but this horror movie took a new approach,with the idea of using a killer doll...and it worked out SO well.The story of a dying killer,transfering his soul into a doll,before dying to avoid Hell,is way more creepier than anything that Friday The 13th or Nightmare On Elm Street had to offer.Unfortunatly,the sequels did not match up to the original.There should not even had been any sequels made for this.The film would have been a stand alone cult classic.The rest of the Child's Play films,did not have the same feel as this one did.After Chucky(aka Charles Lee Ray) was killed in this movie,his soul should have just went on to Hell,and that would have been the end of him.There was absolutley no need for any sequels to made.The original Child's Play is a great classic Horror movie,and there will never be anything else like it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|As a mom who also happens to be an avid reader, with two (out of three so far) children who are the same, I love looking for new books to build our library that everyone can enjoy reading. I'm also a kid at heart, AND a history and mythology nerd. Rick Riordan's series have always delivered a great time for me, my oldest daughter, and my son. I feel they're amazingly written, and Riordan finds a great balance between telling a story and teaching a bit of history and morality without it becoming at all schticky. He keeps his prose nice and loose, making all the characters totally relatable for anyone, as well as preventing the story from being too \\"kiddy\\" or too adult.<br />The Mark of Athena is the 3rd book in Heroes of Olympus series, and to be honest, I thought it was going to be the last, since the Kane Chronicles also has three books. After reading reviews while ordering two books and the Kindle version (no one likes to wait for anyone else to finish for their turn when it comes to Riordan!), I was even more keen to read it, because (without spoilers) it appeared that Riordan was continuing the book beyond the 3rd. Victory! I don't really like watching a series end, so I really ripped through this book.<br />It's great to see Percy and Annabeth back together, it's sad to see Reyna end up alone, and even if you read and re-read and re-re-read all the books throughout the year till the next one comes out (like I do!), it brings surprises and shocks right along with the things you expect to see as the story goes along. Some reviewers did complain that Piper worried too much about her relationship with Jason, but she's a 15 year old daughter of Aphrodite. To me, it makes sense that she focuses so much on him, though it doesn't distract from her times to shine against the monsters using her wiles and charm. :)<br />I loved the focus on Leo in the book, because his story is amazing. Though there are 7 demigods on this quest, they only tell the story from 4 points of view. While some people may find this disappointing, I'm pretty relaxed about it, because I think the next book will have the other 3 (and one more, won't tell though!) points of view come to the forefront a bit.<br />I'm jumping around in my seat waiting for my kids to finish their books, so we can gab about it and look forward to the next one! I hope Rick starts a series about Norse Mythology in the future, I'd love to see what he does with Thor and Odin and Loki and Freyja. :D

0061655554|5.0|25 years later, we have forgotten about this massive transfer of wealth and disruptions to 300,000 lives when RJR Nabisco was acquired in a complex $25B financial deal.  We have forgotten that most business leaders and politicians of both parties instinctively opposed leveraged buyouts, junk bonds and financial engineering as a distraction from the real job of value creation through innovation.  We vaguely recall the exciting movie about very high stakes poker played by all too human financiers and corporate executives.  We conflate this story with Gordon Gecko's quip that \\"greed is good\\".  We treat this story as an outlier, reflecting the bad behavior of a few bad individuals.<br /><br />We miss the broader social and policy perspective at our peril as a nation.  In the 1980's the country embraced Reagan's laissez faire economic policies.  The emphasis on entrepreneurship and resultant growth has certainly benefitted the country and the world.  However, the accompanying acceptance of \\"anything goes\\" business behavior has lead to an ongoing string of disasters: banking crises, housing crises, internet bubbles, stock market volatility, records levels of debt, Ponzi schemes, corporate theft, executive overreach and great concentrations of wealth.<br /><br />This book is important because it chronicles the re-emergence a century later of the 1880's pursuit of wealth through \\"managing the market\\", employing every possible trick.  The participants have lost their ability to place their actions in perspective.  Each deal justifies the means used to win and justifies the pursuit of the next deal.  The opportunity to achieve tremendous wealth attracts highly talented individuals to \\"value capture\\" instead of \\"value creation\\".  Since one has much higher returns, no more risk and no negative social consequences, it is actively pursued.<br /><br />There is no obvious, simple policy solution to managing the excesses of raw financial capitalism.  This book presents a lasting picture of a world where no constraints exist.  Barbarian, indeed.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|\\"The Panther\\" is one of De Mille's best novels, and one that his many fans will not want to miss!  Like most of DeMille's novels, this one is a page-turner that starts at a leisurely pace but builds to a powerful conclusion with lots of twists and turns along the way (no spoilers here).  This novel features John and Kate Mayfield Corey, but also involves Paul Brenner (protagonist in \\"The General's Daughter\\").  See if you can spot the character from a third and different DeMille novel.  All of this is great fun and yes, it works.<br /><br />Without giving anything away, the Corey team is dispatched to Yemen to arrest, or otherwise deal with, the top Al Qaeda leader there, a renegade American known as \\"The Panther.\\"  The story develops into a very insightful look at how US operatives manage to function in Yemen, a highly dysfunctional country that presents the protagonists with more than their share of challenges.  Like always, DeMille manages to be humorous and deadly earnest in turns, and the result is the usual excellent DeMille novel that grips the reader throughout.  The conclusion is believable and unexpected; again, no spoilers here.<br /><br />This one really is one of DeMille's best.  Even readers who are unfamiliar with John Corey et al. and who are picking this as their first DeMille novel will not be let down or disappointed; this story stands very well on its own.  The characterizations are true-to-life, sometimes depressingly so, and the entire novel has an aura of authenticity that assures the reader that DeMille has done his homework at a technical level, while never losing sight of the purpose of the novel, which is to entertain, and indeed captivate, the reader.  Highly recommended.  RJB.

0525958002|4.0|I really had no intention of reading this book, but when my son tossed it my way with a stack of books I figured I'd give it a try. I was never a Duran Duran groupie, but I liked their music so what the heck. The worst thing that might happen would be that I'd toss the book.<br />Actually, this is a decent book. While there is a certain sameness to memoirs written by rockers which go along the lines of sex, drugs, booze, too much money, and excesses of every possible variety, this book was probably more interesting because John Taylor was really sort of a fish out of water when you think about a rock star. Taylor cuts to the chase on this one and admits that as an only child he was sort of a mama's boy who was decidedly non-athletic. On top of that he was raised catholic which had its own issues.<br />I'm not sure anyone is ever prepared for immediate fame and that's probably where a lot of these stories converge. In Taylor's case it appears as though he was even more ill prepared than most. Of course, he has written this book so we know that he made it to the other side possibly a little bruised, but presumably wiser for it.<br />I found Taylor's account of the heady and heavy Duran Duran years interesting. I doubt that many people who adored John would have realized how difficult his life had become. He stated the facts, but his writing seemed sort of flat  and lacking an emotional connection. I wonder if upon reflection he has sort of disconnected from his younger troubled self. In the end, I'd have to say that this book takes a hard look at the excesses of fame and that is its strongest point. Read it, if you are a Duran Duran fan or rock memoirs are your thing.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|My father was a Marine who served in the Pacific in WWII, as did his brother-in-law; and my mother's brother, John, who was wounded in the battle of Iwo Jima. None of these men spoke much of their experiences until right before they died. This series honors their bravery and hardships, and all those who served there. It is difficult to watch at times; but gives the viewer a glimpse of the horror for those who fight in wars; and the tragedy of the innocent people who suffer from wars' death and destruction. Let's pray someday there will be World Peace!
0061692042|2.0|YAWN!  No purpose.  Boring.  This book basically had no plot - unless it was a short story. I kept reading but was so glad to be finished .  Only read it because it was a book club selection.

Torchwood is like Doctor Who, but it is darker and definitely for adults.  I have seen every episode several times and totally recommend this show to those who enjoyed Fringe, Lost and The X-Files.  Captain Jack Harkness, Gwen Cooper and Ianto Jones are three of the best tv characters ever created.

0671042858|2.0|Nine-year-old Trisha has a hard time trying to escape an endless wilderness in southern Maine. I had as hard a time getting into this short-but-not-sweet adventure novel by Stephen King.<br /><br />Stephen King is known for horror stories. \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\\" isn't quite that, though the guy tries: \\"...the woods were full of everything you didn't like, everything you were afraid of and instinctively loathed, everything that tried to overwhelm you with nasty, no-brain panic.\\"<br /><br />Later on, King introduces the possibility of a creature stalking Trisha, but it reads like a sop to his Constant Readers, He even plays with the notion of the beast possibly being supernatural, which only makes it feel more labored to conform to reader expectations. He plays this annoying \\"was-it-or-wasn't-it\\" game up to the end, which is about as anticlimactic a conclusion as King has ever written.<br /><br />King's storytelling skills are in good form. Once you get past the static scenario he constructs, he keeps the plot moving with vividly described small incidents. Never mind that Trisha much too quickly wanders nine miles outside of her search party's rescue radius, or that her interior monologues read like those of a Baby Boomer in late middle age. King knows how to keep you reading, even when what he's writing is much below his best work.<br /><br />One critical element of the story is represented in the title, which references a Boston Red Sox relief pitcher enjoying success at the time of this novel's 1999 publication. Trisha, like King himself a big Red Sox fan, imagines a supportive Tom Gordon at her side. I found this subplot really cheesy, King using a novel to flash his team colors for everyone to see. The whole business of Trisha mirroring Gordon's signature move at various critical times of the narrative comes off especially lame.<br /><br />Much more interesting is King's use of Trisha's desperate situation to ponder the nature of God and the universe. She wonders if the Almighty is an insensate entity, \\"the Subaudible\\" as Trisha recalls her father saying, a Deist incarnation of cosmic indifference, \\"one with no interest in lost little girls, one with no real interest in anything, a knocked-out-loaded God Whose mind was like a circling cloud of bugs and Whose eye was the rapt and vacant moon.\\"<br /><br />Again, this reads like the thinking of a middle-aged guy, not a little girl. But it packs a punch.<br /><br />Ironically, this was the last novel published before King was nearly killed by an SUV. Certainly if King hadn't survived, this book's metaphysical musings would have carried some eerie echoes. Needless to say, I'm glad it doesn't and is regarded today as one of his minor works.e wonders if the Almighty is an insensate entity, \\"the Subaudible\\" as Trisha recalls her father saying, a Deist incarnation of cosmic indifference, \\"one with no interest in lost little girls, one with no real interest in anything, a knocked-out-loaded God Whose mind was like a circling cloud of bugs and Whose eye was the rapt and vacant moon.\\"<br /><br />Again, this reads like the thinking of a middle-aged guy, not a little girl.

B00910Y1OQ|1.0|I had fun until I got to the level with the stray column on the right where your only option is to have at least three bombs or start the whole game over. The odd column isn't attached to the main board so you can't swap and the collectable pieces ar arranged so that a minimum of three bombs are required to clear the level. No bombs, no joy... what's fun about *that*?<br /><br />App uninstalled, glad it was the free app of the day... though it seems over priced at that.
B003CNQPNS|5.0|One of the best series that I have seen, enjoyed, loved and liked for all these years and will love it forever. Had ordered it earlier on the standard shipment and waited for 3 months and more but the DVD never reached me. Then i tired other means of getting it and failed in them. Then made up my mind that i should get my hands on it and then shopped again at Amazon. This time chose the Priority shipping and guess what i received it in three days flat. I must say after i watched it i remembered all the people whom i watched this series along with. The music and the bike still makes me whistle to the screen. So much memory attached to this one. Its not only a Great Series but its very personal for me. The series was way ahead of its time and thus it retains its popularity till today. The DVD box contains four DVDs and a small book describing the contains of the DVD. The title animation is also good and the DVD has been neatly laid out with chapters and episodes. If you have not seen Street Hawk then you are missing something and that's THE MAN.... THE MACHINE..... STREET HAWK.
1596177373|4.0|These are fairly good quality cards with a few repetitive figures on them...unfortunately none of them are from Burton's major still-life type films.

B000JMKQX0|1.0|I had been flirting with the idea of purchasing this book for at least a year, mostly because I had heard that it was written in the form of interviews, and read more like a chapter book. I finally broke down and bought it....so sad. I love my Zombie books, they are usually so action packed, scary, and just plain fun.  This book was everything I hoped it wouldn't be; dull, slow moving, and just kind of irritating. I kept waiting for it to \\"pick up\\" and it never did. I hope the movie is better. I wouldn't recommend it, especially for the price, there are a TON of more entertaining books in the 2.99 to 4.99 price range.
B008ACC9CM|5.0|Jonathan Antoine (17) and Charlotte Jaconelli (now 17) are a classical duo who finished as runners up in Britain's Got Talent in 2012. Jonathan has the best male voice, technically a Heldentenor, that I have heard for decades. This is incredible for his age. Charlotte has a very good voice too, but the combination of their voices is nothing short of magical.<br /><br />Many people found their original audition quite moving and watch it over and over. The UK video can be seen at [link removed search Youtube for Jonathan and Charlotte] and has 23 million hits at the time of writing. The semi-final video [search Youtube] shows them singing \\"Caruso\\" written by Dalla in 1986.<br /><br />In the final they sing \\"The Prayer\\" [search Youtube - final] losing out to the winners, dog act Ashleigh and Pudsey. It doesn't matter: Simon Cowell signed them up for £1 million and the first result is this CD.<br /><br />You can see something of their background and what led up to BGT in the Daily Telegraph article [google Telegraph Jonathan and Charlotte May 12]  There are two excellent videos of them performing at The Sun - google \\"Jonathan and Charlotte perform for The Biz Sessions.\\"<br /><br />I got their autographed CD \\"Together\\" from England when it first came out (and ordered another from Amazon here). If you thought their voices good on Youtube you will be blown away by them on the CD with a good sound system. The dramatic operatic treatment of classical and new songs is amazing. Charlotte has improved greatly in the short time since they sprang to fame. She demonstrates a purity of tone like crystal, almost like a boy treble, on Ave Maria and now a beautiful full richness in the lower registers.<br /><br />I have never heard a tenor sing with such power and spine tingling emotion as Jonathan does for Canto Della Terra. What is remarkable is that every track is wonderful unlike most CDs. I have never had more pleasure from music or been emotionally moved as much by music as these two do.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Great action movie, funny and no one outshines each other.<br />Except for maybe the HULK! Best Marvel movie yet.<br />Can't wait for the sequel.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|George Martin rambles on and on with obscure names and places that have no relevance to the story.  I was disappointed.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Third in the trilogy, sigh. Writing is still terrible, some phrases used over and over again to distraction. I found myself skipping over the \\"HOT\\" stuff to get to the plot, thin as it is.
B0075LTOR2|3.0|Once again, a Roxy retrospective misses the opportunity to become something exceptional. When oh when will there be a real vault trudge? I've always been one of the biggest Roxy fans around and for me every reissue misses the mark. The BBC and other companies hold tapes of truly amazing live and live in studio Roxy Music, especially early Roxy with Eno. When will this be legitimately released? Endless repackaging of the same stuff I bought in the 70s and 80s does not work for me.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|If I try to open Kindle store from the app on my Transformer Prime, the entire app crashes and closes. Yet it works perfectly on my Nexus phone. This is a roadblock hard to get around if you want to add content from your preferred reader. Reading installed content though is a pleasure on any device.
B0057URWSQ|5.0|This series is unique in one way. Watch the first episode and your hooked. Mad Men is good but this is something else. Don't believe me - try it! You wont regret it.

B009NQKPUW|5.0|The visual effects and the unanswered questions really allowed me to enjoy this movie. I would consider this one of the best movies of year. I know many people didn't like this film, but I thought it was absolutely great.

B009329ZF2|5.0|I love this movie it is wild and crazy ride that you just can not sit still with it on the action sceen are stiler and that comedy and drama are just out standing
B004A7UVLC|5.0|Having been a long time fan of Sir Author Conan Doyle's work Sherlock Holmes the father of modern mystery I must admit to being a bit skeptical at first of a modernized version, but I was brilliantly surprised by every aspect of this modern adaptation. Having watched every episode at least 3 times each, I can honestly say Sherlock is now my favorite show bar none. The writing and direction are superb and the acting of Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are spot on. I can't even imagine another set of actors in these roles now. I loved Robert Downey Jr.s portrayal very much and the new show \\"Elementary\\" is also entertaining and enjoyable. But, Sherlock is the best adaptation by far. Benedict Cumberbatch \\"is\\" Sherlock Holmes in every sense of the man from his witty arrogance to his speech and mannerisms. The modernization of Sherlock Holmes is done so well, its hard to believe that it's taken this long for someone to come up with such a wonderful idea. Sherlock brings a freshness and edge to the genre that Sir Author Conan Doyle created. It's come full circle. Bravo!
B007THA4FI|1.0|The worst book I have ever read, in fact couldn't finish it. The characters are awful - didn't like any of them; no redeeming qualities at all. What is the point of writing such an awful book? No empathy for any of them. Time wasted for sure.
B003ZSISGM|5.0|I enjoyed all 3 of Stieg Larsson's books. They were detailed without being boring, and held my attention. I loved the progression of the story and it had a believable ending.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|My sister bought me the first book for my birthday and it was so easy to get wrapped up in the story that when it ended, the way it ended, I had to have this book right away (gotta love Amazon & one cliick) and it was soo good & hot and I bought the last one too! Anyone who loves to read will love this book!
1449410243|2.0|I love the Oatmeal, and had this book preordered as soon as it was available. 5 Very Good Reasons to Punch a Dolphin in the Mouth isn't entirely about dolphins, but unfortunately this book is entirely about cats.<br /><br />The comics are repetitive, and there aren't many of them. I found a few of the comics went on for pages and pages, almost like filler.  It's not the quality I'm used to from The Oatmeal.<br /><br />I'd recommend skipping over this one, or spending your money on the aforementioned 5 Very Good Reasons to Punch a Dolphin in the Mouth.
1400069289|4.0|A detailed book dissecting the habit forming cycles, explaining why some can transform their life through habits while othere are stuck in the rut. What is ha habit? How to identify it? How to change it? How to build new ones? What does science says about it?<br /><br />All this questions and more are answered.<br /><br />Excellent book.
0345803485|2.0|Fifty Shades<br /><br />1.5 Stars rounded up to 2 Stars<br /><br />Let me murmur about this book for a bit...<br /><br />Plot: small points due for originality.  There are brief, interesting moments.  Otherwise, I have never seen or heard of anything so unrealistic in my life.  But, unrealistic doesn't mean it couldn't happen.  Just means stats are against it.<br /><br />Characters: completely contrived.  Gray's character is not realistic even a little bit and so disbelief sat in the pit of my stomach throughout.  Ana's character must have been raised without human contact for the first 20 years of her life - also unbelievable.  Prudish doesn't begin to describe it.For the ladies out there, good or bad, no man behaves like Christian Gray.  None.  It's nonsensical and fairy tale behavior, and not in a good way.  I threw up in my mouth a little bit during portions of his dialogue.  Not really, but  He is a complete and utter tool.<br /><br />Sex: I think the people that like this book, well, they like to read about sex.  I don't have anything against that, but I don't find I have any special affinity for it.<br /><br />Writing & Style:  there were bad, bad elements of the writing.  The worst, for me, was repetitive overuse of words.  Murmur = 197 times.  Inner goddess = 57.  Quirk = 19.  Crap = 92.  Flush = 113.<br />Everyone murmured so much I'm surprised anyone could hear what anyone else was saying.  And, Ana must have a skin disorder...no human flushes that much, for every little thing.<br /><br />Something completely bizarre that is Repeatedly mentioned in the book is that Ana bites her lip and this drives Gray simply wild with passion and desire (which is just silly).  Who bites their lip that much?  Maybe this stems from a disfigurement or disorder, much like the flushing?  Severe overbite?<br /><br />Overall, I did not enjoy it at all...plot, characters, writing style...nothing worthwhile.  I powered through it even though I wanted to quit at least 50 times.I prayed for some redeeming quality.  Didn't happen.  Saddest is that people pay $10 for this when really great books are selling for bargain prices (both Indie and big publisher).<br /><br />I will note that the author intentionally ended her book in a way that attempts to make you want to read the next one.  Tried to give you a little cliffhanger.  Didn't work for me - no interest in reading any more.  Of course, my wife and I had a good time mocking the book...we \\"murmured\\" to each other periodically and laughed at the thought that people murmured non-stop throughout.  Ms. James - please keep a dictionary at hand during your future ventures.  My wife and I also bit our lip at each other and laughed and laughed and laughed.  Ludicrous, oh man...my wife, during one of our laughing fits said, \\"Do you need to be punished?\\" and we laughed until we cried - no joke.<br /><br />But, I don't want to end on a negative note.  I am not the target audience for this book.  I think James deserves credit for writing something that does appeal to some people.  She found an audience and is feeding their need.  Good on her.  She also is fairly sound in regard to the mechanics of her writing or has a decent editor.<br /><br />So, again, not for me, but maybe for you...this is all just one guy's opinion.  My wife and I gave it his book a try just to see what all the hype, hoopla, and madness was about.  Dude's Disclaimer: it was an experiment?  Ha ha.
1250004217|1.0|I can't believe how many 4 and 5 star reviews this book has received.  I was embarrassed by the author's writing and found myself rolling my eyes on several occasions.  I thought her writing was trite, corny, predictable and well suited for sixth graders or middle shoolers. I will not read another book by this author. I must say, the author's stunning success with this book has made me think maybe I should try to write a novel myself... I have never considered myself a talented writer, but neither is she, and if she can make millions writing this terribly mediocre stuff, I just might have a chance!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Perfect ending to the best trilogy i have ever read. Do yourself a favor and read them before the world ends
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Paul Brenner meets John Cory and Kate and all three fight Islamic terrorism. Great premise, typically excellent execution by the always entertaining Nelson Demille.<br /><br />Great book. What a treat!  Like the thanksgiving meal, it takes too long to prepare and is  devoured too quickly.

B0090NNQX6|5.0|This album is a great mix of \\"typically Mika\\"-style music and brand-new fresh art.  I don't buy the \\"deluxe edition\\"s of many CD's, but for this one, it was well worth it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I enjoyed the book. I was curious as to what would happen and the pieces were perfect. I recommend the book.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Once started it is hard to put down!   <br />I love it for so many reasons. The struggles and hardships, the emotion , a great read.
B000OVLINI|5.0|The Shadow of the Wind  starts as a simple narrative about a boy and his father. They live in Barcelona shortly after WW 2. Their lives are simple, the circumstances rather sparse, until Daniel's father introduces him to the cemetery of forgotten books. The book Daniel chooses leads him through lies, lovers, deceit and danger. Carlos Ruiz Zafon ability to describe each character left me wanting to know them better. I did not want to put it down.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|love it but am stuck on level 7 in Greece.  any tips?? I unlock all the jewels but all the pieces don't. show.
B0063IH60K|3.0|You have to put up with all the adds.  At first it wasn't bad most of the ads were silent and you could just press the x in the corner and quickly get rid of the ad.  But after using it for a while the ads are all loud and tougher to get rid of which is starting to wear me out.  It's to bad because it really is a terrific app, but it's just not enjoyable to play anymore.  I'd gladly pay for an ad free version of this, but it's. not offered so I'll. have to look elsewhere
B007SGM084|4.0|It was an excellent read, especially Book 2 & 3.  There was far to much sex not needed to understand the plot of the book.  His life was very sad with how he dealed with the damage, but a very strong man that Ana helped.  Good read, but a lot of the people I talked to never got past the first book because of the weird sex thing.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I decided to rate this app here for one reason; how can you expect anyone to believe a rating for an app when it contains &quot;more better&quot; as the reference to how the game will be after future updates.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|This collection is by far the most comprehensive of the Holmes works.  Stories are arranged by collection and contain some that are hard to find elsewhere.  Having purchased smaller collections before it is nice to have all of the stories together in one book.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The book was great! Rick Riordan, once again, did not disappoint. The way he portrayed the action and characters remained true to the way he created them; he didn't twist them to fit the plot. The book was full of suspense, action-packed, funny, emotional at times, and overall awesome. The plot developed naturally and smoothly. It never seemed forced or choppy. The Mark of Athena is an amazing book, and one of the best purchases I've made on my Kindle.
0606264817|5.0|I received the books and was absolutely excited that the book binding was a great hard back style cover!!!!  I am still a fan of good hard back books eventhough I have a Kindle Fire.  The books will last for a very long time!!  Thanks Amazon!!!
B005HEUKNQ|4.0|I don't own this item, but from everything I've seen and read, I definitely want this.  I can't afford it at these prices, though, so I was hoping to see the new HD/blu-ray versions on Amazon Instant Video, as it seems to indicate here.  By Amazon's own admission via email, these HD/blu-ray versions are NOT on Amazon Instant Video, so their inclusion here is misleading.  Only the traditional standard definition (not remastered) version is available for instant streaming.  Amazon, you either need to not mention it, or give us the HD/blu-ray versions on streaming!

B000BNI99K|3.0|Disappointed in it!!<br /><br />When you hear great american songbook, I was thinking that it was all of HIS great hit. Nothing on there screams ROD STEWART! None of his great song are on it, and I bought this as a christmas gift. The Name and title are very misleading, so do understand none of HIS great songs are on it. :(
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Great follow up to first book. Can't wait for the next one. Wish I had found this series before 50 Shades because this one is so much better...meatier and engaging.
B008220C92|1.0|Sinister is such a boring, stupid movie that you will be lucky if you don't fall asleep watching this rip off of Paranormal Activity on an Apple laptop, or should I say unlucky. Apparently, the writer of suspense books (Ethan Hawke), who is the lead character, walks around his crime scene rental house in the dark, even in the daytime. When he happens to find a scorpion and a snake in his attic, no action is taken to resolve his pest problem. Investigating several murders for his new book, he calls on two men to help him find information that he could have easily found on his Apple computer.  His biggest idiotic move is placing his family in jeopardy so he can write another best seller after a ten year dry spell, even though his family lives in a big mansion fit for a Mitt Romney or Donald Trump, as we find out near the end of the movie. During one of the supposedly scary parts, the movie viewers actually started laughing, which is testament to the fact that this movie belongs on the Hollywood trash heap.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The attraction between Ana and Christian is amazing! A simple touch can spark an intense night of steamy sex and intimacy that makes your heart beat faster!

076115728X|5.0|This is a vibrant color book, showing how art mistakes can be transformed into something beautiful.  I know it is also an allegory for life in general, but parents will have to embellish that for themselves.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|good mix of classical musical to soothe the soul. makes me want to read the book again to find the parts of the book where the music took place:)
B007SGM084|5.0|Billionaire boy meets naive girl. Boy wants to lay claim and somewhat tame clumsy brown haired girl who isn't fully aware of just how feisty, sexy, and beautiful she really is until her inner goddess awakens. Boy, billionaire sexy hot Christian Grey, sets out to turn Anastasia (Ana) Steele into his next submissive. He doesn't do hearts and flowers but will buy his submissive a car and a laptop so that she's able to come when he demands and reply when he calls. He presents her with a contract. She even has her own room in his palatial penthouse apartment. But in Christian's pursuit of Ana, he falls in love. Poor poor Christian Grey -- he slips and falls in love; his instruments of euphoric torture are no match nor a deterrent against the power of love. But that's only the half of it. There are reasons Grey doesn't do hearts and flowers and prefers rocky road sex to vanilla (and there is lots of sex, mind you) and it eventually comes to light, the reasons for his preference and why he is the man that he is.<br /><br />After plowing through the language and the point of view of a 21 year old recent college grad(Ana), I was able to submerge into the story and paid little attention to the repetitive words that seemed to annoy and cause other readers to stumble or become annoyed and enraged. By constantly describing the ticks of her characters, this author helped this reader to care about Christian and his issues as well as Ana, who has a few issues of her own. Everyday people have quirks (bites her lip, runs his long finger across his chin, he snarled, she grimaces, etc). People have annoying little ticks and quirks and the author presented them in this book, over and over again, creating vivid visual images that came to life in the reader's mind. There's no doubt that you have an idea of what Christian  looks like, smells like, sounds like or how he walks, talks and feels about certain matters because Ana (the teller of these stories) never stops talking about them or him.<br /><br />I love the character Christian Grey, the ultimate alpha male who thinks he can control everything but one thing he cannot control and that is love. Perhaps he is a dominant who enjoys inflicting pain in the midst of pleasure but even dominants aren't immune to love and that is what the Fifty Shades Trilogy sets out to show, that you never know when or where love will happen but when it comes WATCH OUT! Love broke Christian down to the stumps, had him vulnerable and naked before Ana: makes you wonder who was the true dominant in this trilogy.. We know that, in the beginning, Ana is a bit insecure and clumsy but through love, which she hadn't expected either, the goddess and conscious awaken and emerge. The book is written from Ana's point of view, these are her words and the story is exposed through the sights, sounds and emotions of a 21 year old 'innocent'. It's a good erotic love adventure sprinkled with silliness and a bit of drama. I'm certain it wasn't written to receive the accolades of the Nobel community or to attract a Pulitzer. It's a good fun exciting sometimes annoying read (book three doesn't have so many of the repetitive words people seem to hate but by then Ana has changed a bit). The sex is HOT and so is Grey and Ana emeges a beautiful Goddess. So relax and enjoy the read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|its amazing and I love it a lot. it helps me get away from whatever I am thinking about that day.

B004SUWR2C|5.0|my mom bought this game for her phone and she let me play it and it was GREAT! i just love the way this game set up. HOPE YOU LIKE IT!!!!!
B009A3NGF4|3.0|Good stuff, but it is not as strong and amazing as Sigh No More.  Some of the songs come across a bit contrived and \\"I will wait\\" is totally targeting the masses, not the M&S fan.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|If you like 80's music, you will really enjoy this movie.  The actors do a great job and the songs are awesome.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I have this on my ipods and my kindle fire and I absolutely love it. it is addicting and is a way to escape from the real world. I don't understand why people are giving it such terrible reviews just because something is not in the game. its terrible! SHAME!
0783230079|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies. This although was a used product, was literally like new. No scratches, original packaging, and very fast shipping.
034580404X|5.0|The books were a great read. Erotic yes... But I did enjoy the story as well.... I laughed, i cryed, i got excited. I now have two sets. One at the moment is lent out and the other is for me. I've read these books more than once. So yeah u can say I loved them....
0785125965|3.0|I bought World War Hulk because I bought Planet Hulk years ago and enjoyed it immensely. I liked the continuation of the story from the previous comic, however I found the story in World War Hulk a bit short. I thought the art style was inferior to that of Planet Hulk as well. Instead of the gracefully drawn, epic images of the previous, some characters looked as though they were drawn in a rush. Finally, I'm a bit biased because I'm not a big fan of conventional superhero comics, so their presence turned me off a bit. I've obviously written this under the assumption that the buyer will have read Planet Hulk. If this is not the case, I expect that you will enjoy World War Hulk much more.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|initially, I was just going to say it is pretty, but way too easy to beat. Then, I beat it and it wasn't over! This is fun and addicting. plus, the little historic facts are interesting. My only complaint is that the story is weak. Still, its pretty good.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|fun, easy to use cafe game... if you like Sanrio, you'll enjoy this game. Have had no glitches with Kindle. Wish you could trade coins for heart money. You don't have to spend real money to play.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|I gotta admit, i love the theme in this film, about a loving Dad rescuing his child. Sure beats how single Dads are unfairly portrayed in most Hollyweird films, as clueless \\"deadbeats\\".<br /><br />That aside, you'll love the actions scenes. Most are of the \\"you gotta be kidding me\\" variety, but hey, this is a popcorn film.<br /><br />Can't wait to see Taken 2.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is a great place to find fun and interesting ideas and wonderful pictures. it is a great place to express yourself and find cool things!
B006DRVFRQ|4.0|Nice interface.  it's easy to use and adding content is straight-forward.  I keep up with multiple news sites and blogs all in one place.  Very convenient!
B0027MJU00|5.0|If you enjoy dipping your toes into the murkiest abyss of the human experience,  author Gillian Flynn is the dark angel who can gently draw you into the miry black undercurrents of Hell where the Devil makes love to your sister while on a pedestal not far away, a bespeckled Chihuahua huffs  a helium balloon and recites the Gettysburg Address in perfect mandarin! Yeah, I don't know what that means either but the point is,... Stop reading my pathetic review and GET THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Don't waste your money on this, or on the first book of the series.  Poorly written, with a lack of depth on the characters, it is not worth a penny.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Evermore lets you share notes photos and more among all your computes. I like it for import notes and general ones as well. Make multiple notebooks to organize notes.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|see the subject line. I'm not retyping this on my kindle fire.<br />bottom line - I like the game a lot. I would not pay $5 for it...
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is a great price for a lengthy challenging game. The graphics show up wonderfully on kindle and gameplay is enjoyable.
1594203334|4.0|It's easy to get caught up in the trending birthing and parenting style so this arrived at the perfect time for me when the buzz about attachment parenting seemed suffocating. It's an account of another way of doing something with no guilt or shame and shows you that there really is no wrong way when love and attention are shown. Reinforces that there is no perfect in parenting. From the book, it appears that epidurals are not just common but expected there and formula is fine. I haven't had time to get all the way through it now that my baby has arrived but look forward to picking it up again when I need a break from the know it all \\"attachment or death\\" parents rants. This is from someone who took a natural childbirth class, tries to buy as much organic as possible, believes in many of the concepts of attachment parenting and is breastfeeding.<br /><br />UPDATE: My baby is 8 months and I am almost done with it. Would have been nice to read it BEFORE I had the baby since 3 months seems like the time of transition for many French women...they go back to work, their babies start sleeping through the night and stop breastfeeding. Would have loved to have known this and planned for it as my decision to go back to work just part-time at 4 months seemed crazy to many around me and I felt very alone in any decision that included taking care of my needs as just as important as that of my baby's needs. Wish their was a movement or mom's group that followed this type of more balanced approach but if I had read the book sooner, I could have started that group.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|After enjoying the first two books so much, I eagerly read the third book.  Though the story got a bet too out there, I really got into this book.  My only let down was the ending.  A few pages to wrap up these people's lives was too little.
B008RYN44U|4.0|I was expecting this album to be good...but to be honest, it's more than that, this album is great!<br />I give 4 stars because there are only two songs Easy and Sparkle, that are not as perfect as the others.<br />But Push and Shove is one of their best songs ever!<br /><br />My Top 5<br />Push and Shove<br />Undercover<br />Looking Hot<br />Gravity<br />Heaven<br /><br />One of the Best of 2012!
B007SGM084|5.0|Awesome Books! Porn for the ladies LOL.. no for real tho.. you get wrapped up into the characters, I finished the first book in one day.. just couldn't put it down.  Can't wait for the movie.

B00910Y1OQ|5.0|really enjoying this one.  hope they make like these.  they should add some hidden object with this game.  or maybe where you twain points to build a city
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I got this game because it looked like a fun game where I could run my own restaurant. so far it has fulfilled my desire of being a restaurant owner and I am making profit :D the only cons for this game are the food spoils rather quickly and the only way you can earn gems is by spending money. also adding goals to the game would be nice. Overall a fun game that requires time management and commitment to serving food to customers for a profit.
B005PK4ZHY|5.0|I've been watching Desperate housewives since the beginning. I didn't get to see the final season and was completely bummed.

034580404X|3.0|My co workers kept talking about this book and I wasn't that interested in reading it at first. I borrowed the first book to see what all the hype was about and I can't really say I liked it but I didn't hate it...It didn't really have a story line and I skipped over a lot of pages because of the sex it seemed to me that's all they did.. Ana was always \\"creaming her jeans\\" sheesh u would think she would be changing clothes all the time as much as she was all hot and bothered..To me it was a book about a college virgin gets de virginized by a a guy who is rich has serious mental and sexual issue's.. I wish it had more of a story line and i wish Ana had more of a clue..she got one every now and then but for the most part she was pretty clueless..But one thing I gotta point out she didn't like all these things in the contract pertaining to the sex but yet didn't she end up doing most of it anyways??? In the parts where she's in danger it seems like the book wrapped it up pretty quick and didn't really get too much into it..I did like the last book at the end where it was told from Christian's point of view..I gotta agree I wish more of that was in the book...I just think most of all the books are them having some kind of sex and it gets annoying after a while..

B00338QENI|5.0|Bioengineering continues to grow exponentially, and never faster than in the two years since the publication of this book.  We know so much about growing parts of ourselves for research and treatment, yet where di these non- fetal cells start.  First lesson in this book, while cancer specimens have defect of immortality, only some lines live forever.  Whose cells.  How old are these lines? What did informed consent mean then.<br />Now I am a huge advocate of this kid of research .  I lost a daughter to disease that this research may cure in the future.  I just say if we are going to play the big games, we must understand the rules and treat the players respectfully.<br />Add in the biographical material on the main p,ayers, and well written, articulate prose; you have great book.<br />Why review now?talked to a young man in cell line industry.  I understood him because of the book.  We had a great conversation, and now he is gonna read,  and so should you
B003JTHXOK|5.0|As usual, Nicholas Sparks never disappoints his readers.  The book is totally awesome and the story is unpredictable and certainly keeps the readers interest.  I am really glad that I purchased this book and I enjoy reading it on my Kindle Fire.

B004DMIIOG|5.0|Kenji spends most of his time playing a virtual game called OZ. This summer he gets dragged by his friend Natsuki to her hometown. She's gonna pay Kenji to pose as her fiancee to keep her family off her back. Kenji solves a code on the OZ game while playing at Natsuki's house. Upon solving this code he accidentally active a world destruction program. Kenji and Natsuki's family must defeat the games program to save the world.<br /><br />Summer Wars is a pretty original movie. The plot is a breath of fresh air. The animation, voice acting and soundtrack are all very well done. This anime is lighthearted and serious at the same time. There's a great mix of drama action and comedy. This movie has it all. Definitely give it a watch.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book keep my interest not so much because of the graphic sex scences but more because of the unexpected twists & turns.
B001VS46DC|5.0|One man's opinion-- Diana Krall can play any kind of music she wants to and create a masterpiece work of art.  I have read a review (not of this video however)<br />with an observation that the quality of sound was not \\"up to snuff\\".  Perhaps, like myself, he does not have television with a sound system that can fully handle the<br />full subtlety and power of the music; but it is mesmerizing to watch Diana and her band work.  Until I can upgrade my video equipment, I purchase the CD of the<br />performance as well and play it on my old but superb Yamaha component system and listen with my eyes closed so I focus entirely on the sound.  I don't mind a bit<br />to experience the performance more than once--once for the visual and again for the aural experience.
B009HXG9UQ|4.0|Being a movie nut, 2 or more per day due to injury to my back.....I'm pretty hard on movies shows etc,I must say being a father of 10 7 of which are girls this movie is a great fit between parents teens and below. Done in a play type film it brings a Quentin Tarantino style of film rated for family. A must see and well worth the money.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Amusing but needs more levels and challenges for using bonus items. Completed game and still had many bonus items unused. Glad it was a Free App of the day as I would not have paid $4.99 for it.

B005S9EJ46|5.0|What a wonderful storyline, and particularly timely given the number of boomers coming of that certain age!  Who wouldn't want to spend their \\"golden years\\" in the shadow of the British Raj--a time period as romantic for Westerners as it was volatile for India.<br /><br />Some of my favorite actors were in this movie and it lived up to the reputations they each had built over their years of stage and screen. The story will make you despair, and laugh and cry, and wonder what your elder years will be like. But the realism and simplicity with which the story was told will make you feel really good.<br /><br />Just remember.....If everything is not right, please wait a while, because everything will be all right in the end.  If it is not all right, it is not the end.---Gotta love that!!!<br />Namaste!
1584282584|5.0|I bought this book because I wanted to learn more about on camera flash techniques for events and weddings. It is an easy to read book and I am half-way through after a couple short evening reads. I have already learned some valuable tips and tricks that I am sure will help my photography proceed to the next level, especially as far as flash is concerned. I highly recommend Neil's books and I love his work. Thanks Neil for teaching me a few things! I feel if you can walk away from a book or a class learning a valuable tip or trick or two that will really help you improve it's well worth it. This book I believe will do that for you, unless you are a know-it-all type (in which you're beyond help) or at Neil's level. Well worth it and great buy! This will be on my shortlist of books that stay on my bookshelf for many years of reference (God willing) .
B009B50QOU|2.0|I've been an avid Green Day fan for some time, and this isn't even close to being their best work. It's a bit of a misfire. Try again; you've done amazing things before.
0440237688|5.0|All I have to say is that this is one of my favorite books. I've reread it quite a few times. I absolutely love it. There's so much to say, but I'll keep it simple. If you haven't read this book, you should definitely read it. It is one of the best books there is out there.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved the first one and this one is great as well. i cant wait for #3. she is a great author
B005LAIHRC|5.0|I watched the flick not expecting much but wanting to see if Tom Cruise could pull off a musical.  Yes, yes he can!  He sang some of the songs just as well as the the original artists.  Not only that, he was completely believable as a drugged-out/ high-as-a-kite rock star.<br /><br />Now, as for the rest of the movie, I think I really enjoyed it because it struck a chord with me.  I was growing up/ a young adult in the 80's in Orange County in Southern California.  I remember driving up to LA and \\"cruising\\" on Sunset Blvd and some of my friends trying to sneak into the clubs with fake ID's.  The big hair in the movie didn't even look weird to me... it still looked good (ha ha ha).  So... I am not sure I could truly recommend this movie to people that did not come out of that era because I am very biased.  However, if you grew up in the 80's, love rock and roll and like musicals, then this movie is for you.<br /><br />I liked it so well I just bought the sound track!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|After the exotic, cynical and adventurous, it gets a predictable rating. Towards the end, you start to understand why he is the way he is, but it's not quite clear to the extreme of why he does what he does.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Good monitor, does the job, gets buggy every so often but that's more a phone issue than the app itself.
B006LSZECO|3.0|A very slow read and you wonder why at chapter 6 that they still haven't figured it out.  A plausible ending, though you wished it would have happened sooner with a crash at the end for the main character.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Gotta say, I was hooked!! Could not put it down. It was hot at times but as well as redundant at others. Great time burner though, in more ways than one...Hehe!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Cynical, adventurous and exotic is the best way to describe this first book.  At first it seems in the \\"norm\\" at the beginning, then it changes and you wonder what this girl is getting herself into.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This app does not let you have all of the features you have with with web interface.  that being said, it gives me everything I care about as a person who just like to keep up on what is going on with people I know.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I haven't seen it yet as I thought I was getting DVDs. I will watch it but it is hard to tie up my computer.
030758836X|3.0|this book was the most twisted thing i've read in a long time. yeesh! I mostly skipped Part I and really started reading in Part II and didn't feel like I missed anything, which is why I gave it three stars. I was also frustrated with the ending somewhat. +++Spoiler+++ I thought the way the story was going that she would get caught or we'd get some psychological testing . . . how exactly do you implant yourself? . . . I didn't imagine NIck just giving up in the end or willingly have a child with this psychotic break, another reason I only gave it three stars.<br /><br />However, very suspenseful read and very well written.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Very slow moving.  The characters are dull and uninteresting. Found it hard to care about them  She should stick to fantasy.
B008476HBM|5.0|I love this book.  I read this book 20 years ago and I'm reading it a second time.  I love it even more.  I plan to read it again in the near future.  I just love the two main characters, Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.  The details of their thoughts make you feel like you know them.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Ever since Samuel L Jackson uttered those seven little words at the end of the first Iron Man movie comic book fans had been foaming at the mouth for this film.  I'm happy to say that it lives up to all of my expectations.<br /><br />With such a strong cast what's not to like?<br /><br />'Nuff said!
B0099G3I96|3.0|I am a long time fan of ND and have all the cds including the Gwen solo stuff. There are some good tracks on here but I feel like overall it is a Gwen solo sound instead of a ND vibe. I feel like Im listening to it several times in hopes that it gets better. I do like Push and Shove, Sparkle, and Easy... a lot. Maybe the Tragic Kingdom/Rock Steady magic is gone?????
B008PE9GSA|2.0|I have allways been a fan of the group and was pleased to see this new release up for sale.Unfortunately the album is a large disapointment. They cannot sing in an understandable way and the entire set of tracks sounded discordant and muddy..back to the \\"oldies\\" for me.
B009B50QOU|4.0|Im a 90s kid so I have all the Green Day recordings up to Nimrod. They lost me for a while (like ten years)...just wasn't feeling the American Idiot era. Then I saw them play Oh Love on TV and I decided to download it. Amazon was selling UNO for $5 on release week. So I bought the whole album. I would have paid $20 for it after listening to it. I've listened to the whole record start to finish probably 20 times or so now. Its a solid Green Day album. There are moments I think its a little Dookie-esk, but its way more musically advanced. I have gone back and listened to the raw Green Day of years past (1039 smoothed out slappy hour, dookie, and insomniac) Uno isnt in there. But it is in the family of great Green Day records. I really like nuclear family, Carpe Diem, Oh Love.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Lots of fun - easy to use and fun to play.  Works very well - no problems or conflicts on my android devices.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|This album is good. Really good. Enough all ready with hoping they will make Hybrid Theory again. They have evolved, become better musicians, and are creative. With all that said, this album is as close to the old days as they are gonna make. Its alot more electronic, but the songs are stripped down. No instrumental intros. No politics. No nuclear holocaust. I appreciate these guys and hope they keep at it for years to come. Lost in the Echo, Burn it Down, and Castle of Glass are my faves.

B0063IH60K|4.0|This is the best solitaire app on the market. I would happily pay 2.99 for an ad free version. I am so tired of the videos which crash my Fire. Please? Pretty please?
B0098VXE50|5.0|A new approach to a favorite fairy tale.  A little on the dark side (not as dark as the adaptation starring Sigorney Weaver) and packed with action.  Even the guys will like this \\"chick flick\\".
B005LAIH4A|3.0|The original story is so famous that I don't think I have to recap it. The computer animated film adaptation of a Dr. Seuss book is exactly what you expect from a Hollywood studio, for better or worse. It is a story of adventure and romance set in a colorful world of animation. Characters are likable (except one). There are pleasant and lively (but forgettable) musical numbers. And of course, the Lorax, an orange-colored creature with a long, bushy moustache.<br /><br />This is a fun, family-oriented film with a message, which is conveyed in a very straightforward way. This was a bit surprising to me as \\"The Lorax\\" is made by Illumination Entertainment, a company best known for \\"Despicable Me.\\" Those who remember Gru and his army of minions may miss the dark humor that would have been perfect for the Dr. Seuss adaptation.<br /><br />While nuance and ambiguity are integral part of language, visuals play a major role in film. It is understandable that in translating the original book's text to screen, something must go. What arrives instead is a good-natured and idealistic hero Ted Wiggins, his love interest Audrey, and a \\"villain\\" Aloysius O'Hare, mayor of Thneedville, who has made an enormous fortune by selling fresh air to the residents. Their action-filled story almost overshadows that of Once-ler and The Lorax.<br /><br />As entertainment \\"The Lorax\\" is pretty good, but sometimes it looks as if, instead of complementing each other, two stories are competing for attention within one film.

B00007LTIC|5.0|This Album is a rarity in music and unheard of in 2012, it's a perfect album from the first song to the last..

0525953728|5.0|I didn't think about writing a review for this wonderful book until I read the new york times review this sunday.  They tell way too much of the story in their review, put a typical liberal spin on the thing....\\"he's just a killing machine....blah, blah, blah...\\"  Don't be fooled for a minute.  This book is about American heros who sacrificed much for all of us. They put their lives on the line to keep us safe.  The guy writing for the nytimes review can't even bring himself to acknowledge this, instead he focuses on the terrorists killed.  Typical. And another point, no secrets are revealed in this book.  It is well written first hand account of the killing of Bin Laden.<br /> You will be inspired, moved and in awe of our soldiers bravery.  I would say this is a don't miss book.  It is captivating from beginning to end.  Well done!
B004EPZ06G|4.0|Without doubt, this is a simple comedy where you will laugh out loud and wonder how the boys managed to screw up bigtime once again...and with a mysterious monkey.  Mike Tyson dancing at the Thailand wedding is a scream.  This will not go down in history as a memorable classic, but it is pure, good old-fashioned entertainment.  I liked it and look forward to the sequel.
B005LAIHR2|1.0|Before everyone that loved this movie attacks me, please don't. I did not attack you for liking it. That said...I absolutely lovelovelove 80s music. It is the soundtrack to my life. To hear my beloved songs....destroyed....by people who can NOT sing (Mary J Blige excepted here) sickened me. Even with fast forward there was a very poor excuse for a plot behind the vocal failures. All I can say is thank goodness for Redbox. Worst buck fifty I ever spent.

B004ZQRFGM|4.0|I have to admit, I bought this CD partly because of my curiousity, whether this woman from Europe could capture the feeling of the blues. The album cover was intriguing as well. I discovered that she is truly a guitar virtuoso with a genuine commitment to the genre. What was a little hard to beleive in some of the lyrics was her adoption of the tribulations of the creators of the blues as being her own, which she certainly was trying to do. I'm not being entirely fair, as I accepted the Brits doing so. Still I admire her embracing the music and the feeling, so much that she did that her identification with it surely must feel real to her; she's not faking it. The top-notch musicianship of this beauty really must be experienced. I can't help but think Robert Johnson would smile.
B005HEWO44|5.0|Faced with joining the Federation crew and the Maquis crew together to fill vacant position on the ship, Janeway has to make some tough decisions.  Who are the best technically qualified people and do they possess the leadership skills she needs to help the Voyager get home.  Even at top warp speed they are 75 years away from Earth.<br /><br />B'Elanna Torres is becoming a problem as her Klingon blood makes her emotional and violent at times and unable to control her aggression.  Commander Chakotay pushes her upon Janeway to become the next Chief Engineer but Torres has already broken the nose of present lead in the engineering department.  The constant pressure from Chakotay even is making Janeway wonder if he is unbiased enough to be her second in command.<br /><br />The Voyager and her crew are faced with a life threatening encounter with a quantum singularity and Janeway has to use all of the crew to find the best solutions to save their lives.  Can the Maquis and Federation crewmembers stop fighting and get along enough to gel together as a team.....<br /><br />It is hard to put aside old hatreds and distrust and that is what the crew is facing.  Janeway is discovering that many of the Maquis are highly skilled and talented people and that she must learn to use them and trust them if the Voyager is to survive.<br /><br />This episode is used to bring along the cast's backgrounds and develop the character personalities even further.  It is a good one and I enjoyed watching it.  I recommend it to you.
B005LW5J9O|1.0|The Swerve is a polemic expressing the author's negative views on Christianity. De Rerum Natura is a hook on which to hang his polemic. Like many polemics, it is entertaing, easy to read, and simplistic.
B005HEW7JG|5.0|I am an Amazon Prime member and I just hooked up our new Roku 2XS box. The first thing I watched was this series as I love Sci-Fi and I have been a Star Trek fan ever since it first came out on TV.<br /><br />The Voyager is launched from Deep Space Nine on a mission to find a missing Maquis ship.  Janeway is highly interested to find the ship as one of her top officers is on board as an undercover spy for the Federation.  Janeway takes a former Maquis who is imprisoned to go with her on the mission and his name is Tom Paris.  The Maquis ship disappeared in the Badlands and once the Voyager enters into the area they find themselves being scanned and suddenly transported, ship and all, 70,000 light years to the Delta Quadrant.<br /><br />Some of the crew died in the transfer and now they are short staffed and facing an unknown situation with a large space array in front of them operated by a powerful alien presence that they have to convince to send them back home....<br /><br />The first episode sets up the character list and tries to help develop their personalities and skills so you can begin to understand their roles and the entire series.  If you intend to watch this series then this episode is a must to watch as you will understand why they are in the Delta Quadrant and why they can't get home so easily.  This is a good story line and you will enjoy it.  Some of the acting is rather stiffly done as the actors begin to feel out their roles and learn how to mature their acting into the characters they are trying to play.  Captain Janeway comes across as overpowering and arrogant at times in this episode but her personality changes as the season goes on.<br /><br />The streaming worked fine and I had absolutely no problems or issues at all with it.  I could easily pause, back up and fast forward through the show without problems.  The series is broadcast in 480 P 4:3 but I used an HDMI cable and expanded the picture to fill the screen  of a 55 inch LCD TV and it came out clear and I have no complaints at all.<br /><br />I enjoyed watching this episode again and I recommend it to you, especially if you are a Star Trek fan.me out clear and I have no complaints at all.<br /><br />I enjoyed watching this episode again and I recommend it to you, especially if you are a Star Trek fan.

B00936A2SM|5.0|If you were to listen to one fusion artists this year, this CD would be the one! The multi-talents of Jeff Berlin, Scott Henderson and the incredible Dennis Chambers, blew me away in the first three bars of track one. I was really curious because after track one, they're doing a lot of Weather Report tunes  and their pick is not just the basic ones.  Listening to each tune, you could swear that there's keywords in it. But there is none. And I bought a lot of Jeff Berlin solo CDs in the past couple of years and he really shines on this one. I'm sorry next to Jaco Pastorius, Berlin was the next one that showed me exploratory\\"base surgery\\"! Getting back to the band. Their sound and their sense of\\"gel\\"are the utmost quality in making a trio kick butt! I'm really at a loss for words the CD, because I was impressed that they did a few songs and then did the rest of the album doing Weather Report. You matche up with any band that does WR and they will out surpass them. When you listen to these tunes, keep telling yourself, this is only a trio! Fantastic guys, thanks so much for proving to the jazz fusion world and listeners, that there is still something worth listing to! I feel the jazz fusion these past couple years has been very lame and really not satisfactory for the jazz musician's ear. Please buy this CD, it's well worth it! A lot of people think that Mike Portney is the greatest drummer around. Listen the Dennis Chambers on this CD, you'll find there's another player in the house! Overall an excellent, excellent CD.
0399157565|3.0|What can I say about Scarpetta number twenty? I didn't dislike the book, but in my opinion, Cornwell has yet to produce a follow-up book that is in anyway comparable to the quality of her first six to eight books. This review does contain a few mild spoilers!<br /><br />Before I air my complaints, I will give credit where credit is due. Bone Bed reintroduces readers to the Kay Scarpetta they met in Virginia. For the first time in I don't know how many books, Scarpetta is back in her diving gear and working the crime scenes like she used too. That is the one thing I really appreciated about this book. Kay is sharp. I had forgotten what an impressive investigator she could be. As she goes through a crime scene, very little escapes her attention. Her intelligence, ambition, and compassion are magnetic. I can't speak for everyone, but that is the character that captured my attention and held my interest in 90s.<br /><br />With that said, I found her supporting characters highly annoying and redundant. Marino and Benton are still stuck in a downward spiral of regret and resentment. I know that real life issues (you know, your average faked death and attempted rape) don't go away over night, but I think Cornwell has taken it to a level that is entirely unnecessary. I for one, am very tired of hearing the sad song that refuses to end. Benton played dead; Mario got drunk and tried to play hooky. Naturally, these flaws in character will keep the two of them from being best friends and undoubtably leave some skeletons in the closet, but Cornwell has strung it out to the degree that she has allowed it to monopolize the chemistry that made the characters so captivating in the beginning.<br /><br />Another issue I had with this book is that I felt like I had read it already. Scarpetta and her team discover links between several different homicides and find themselves chasing a deranged serial killer. As they close in, the lunatic loses control and ends up going after ... Wait, I don't want to spoil your fun, I'll let you guess, but I'm betting you'll get it right without even having to buy a vowel!! Any of that sound familiar? It's almost as if Cornwell follows a formula. She changes the locations, characters, and modus operandi, but the big picture remains the same. While this formula may be making her millions, it has flattened her series and turned into average and predictable. She has sold Scarpetta out and it's a d*** shame.don't want to spoil your fun, I'll let you guess, but I'm betting you'll get it right without even having to buy a vowel!! Any of that sound familiar?

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Really, really enjoyed this book. The story moved so quickly I was disappointed, I wanted more.  Once again we are reunited with Eva & Gideon and their totally addictive, seductive, hot, steamy, unhealthy yet unperfect loving relationship. There are some great unexpected twists in this book and I loved them. Gideon & Eva continue on their very rocky yet super hot relationship. I love Eva's character, she takes shit from no one, including Gideon. Strongly recommend, can't wait for book three.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|Fabulous movie! Suspenseful, dramatic, mysterious with fantastic acting. Story was put together perfectly. V's voice alone will draw anyone into this movie. I didn't want it to end!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|The Panther is, perhaps, my favorite of DeMille's books so far. I've read everything that he has written (as far as I know), and have very much liked each of his works. I always anxiously await the next. The Panther has more humor (witty repartee, asides to the reader, etc.) per page, than any of his other writings so far, and that element, for me, is his strongest appeal. He is able to do this without distracting from the narrative flow; rather, he enhances it. The story line is good and keeps you interested to the last page. Of course, the theme is a familiar one, shared by many popular and excellent action/thriller writers today - Islam fundamentalist (or other) extremists posing serious threat versus U.S. (or other) military/law enforcement/spy operatives who bend or break the rules to defeat them, but we are glad they do (Lee Child, Brad Thor, Andy McNab, Vince Flynn, and others). Occasionally, DeMille's stylistic choice (or quirk) in starting sentences with the conversational \\"Anyway,\\" and \\"I mean,\\"(often several times in a chapter, or even on the same page) becomes a little annoying. Aside from that, I very much enjoy his writing and style, and invariably regret that a book has come to an end and I must wait for his next. This latest was very balanced, witty and interesting from beginning to end.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|I heard a lot of hype about Homeland - particularly from one of my sons.  After it brought home the bacon at the Emmys I decided to buy Season 1 and give it a look.  I was not disappointed.  Anyone familiar with the Manchurian Candidate will recognize the plot line - captured U.S. soldier turned sleeping time bomb after months of brainwashing.  But Homeland is no mere knock-off.  Tightly woven into the events of 9/11, the writers manage to keep the viewer on edge and off balance.  Though much is predictable, much more is not - and that's what makes one keen to see the next episode.  Quite unlike me, I watched all of Season 1 in one weekend.  It is that good.  It's the closest thing to intelligent British drama that I've seen on U.S. television in a long while.  The acting by Claire Danes and Damian Lewis is top notch, though kudos are due to the entire cast.  Well-written, well-acted, well-directed and engrossing drama.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I got this game for my six year old as she loves to play it in real life. I have to admit that I play it every day. it is as addictive as the real game. I do wish the coins would regenerate faster, which is why I went with four stars, but you do get to earn additional coins to up your regeneration limit every so often.

B007ZI06FE|4.0|This is an intriguing paranormal romance, featuring vampires, steam cabs, and a very alternate Victorian London. I had a little trouble warming up to the hero--Blade--and found his slang a bit distracting. However, the action was top-notch and the romantic bond between Honoria and Blade was sizzling.<br /><br />I also really enjoyed the cast of characters--her siblings and his friends.<br /><br />Fantastic worldbuiling! I found the world was almost a character of its own!
B002PEP4SC|4.0|I liked it for something new to read.  i love the show so much. i had trouble not comparing the two. its short but good
B003VANOFY|1.0|I'll start of with the pros:<br /><br />- WIRELESS<br />- DECENT QUALITY<br />- NICE RANGE<br />Now, for the cons. Oh my goodness the cons.<br /><br />- Crackling / Popping noise with the Mic and the Headphones. It pops and crackles when listening to music and performing tasks such as playing games.<br />- The freaking cable broke after a week, after taking it out with minimal force. It got crooked beyond repair.<br />- It's a pain in the ass to get this thing to work.<br /><br />Final Opinion: If you're looking for a crackling popping noise every time you listen to music, or for it to break after a week and a half, this headset is for you.<br /><br />If you don't want to have to deal with the cons, get something by Audiotechnica and add a Mod mic. Better quality, and much less hassle.<br /><br />0.5/5 because I'm not that harsh.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This was a great book. A great story intertwined in a great mystery that will keep you guessing. Well written._@_
B002SRQ214|4.0|I have had this product for almost a year now so I figured I would come and add my two cents to the reviews.<br /><br />I bought this for about 130$ a little less then a year now, and now it is even cheaper - sub 100$.<br />The performance on this little chip is swell, doing anything I throw at it. Keeping in mind, I don't 3D render, so I'm definitely not pushing this CPU to its limits.<br /><br />My Computer Specs:<br /><br />AMD PHENOM 965 II BLACK 3.4GHZ<br />4GB CORSAIR VENGEANCE MEMORY 1600MHZ<br />ASROCK M3A770DE AM3 MOTHERBOARD<br />SEAGATE BARRACUDA 500GB 7200RPM HDD<br />ANTEC 300 CASE<br />SAPPHIRE HD 6770 1GB VIDEO CARD GDDR5<br />CORSAIR CX600W POWER SUPPLY.<br /><br />It pairs well on a budget gaming rig, or just an everyday email PC, but if you're looking for that, I'd recommend an APU.<br /><br />Only one downside though. The stock cooler. I was stupid enough to not buy an aftermarket cooler (actually I did but forgot to buy thermal paste) and I payed the price. This chip will get loud and hot under pressure. So I'd recommend a decent aftermarket heatsink to keep this baby cold and quiet.<br /><br />4.5/5 just because the stock cooler is bad. With a decent aftermarket cooler you can easily bring this thing to about 4.0GHZ no problemo.

0307588343|5.0|I've done a lot of reading on the financial crisis here and abroad.  This was not my first look at the Wall Street/banking scandal and this book is important for one very good reason.  Everyone has written about how horrible it was for the investment banks to package up residential mortgages as mortgage backed securities and then the bet against those investments via the credit default swap.  What no-one I've read yet has described in detail, until this book, is the underlying cause of what caused the crash.  The repeal of Glass/Steagall was the driving piece of legislation that allows banks to act like investment houses and investment house to act like banks.  That law was put there for a reason after the Great Depression and removing it allowed the bad behavior we all witnessed and are paying for now.  Read this book.  Yes, it is one person's vantage point but sometimes it is better to hear from someone in the trenches than a senior executive's carefully worded excuses for the colossal errors they made.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Was an interesting read dealing with dominants and submissives-a real eye opener.  It has made me want to read more about what would make a person want to become a submissive and subject themselves to being controlled.

B001EBWINQ|5.0|Great movie. I believe this is one of the best movies of all time. It is very suspenceful and drama filled.
B00503BN1M|1.0|So, so, so bad.  How could someone write something this pathetic?  I couldn't finish it.  Natalie Portman has done so much better than this.  Really diminished her acting ability and my respect for her ability to pick a role.

B006M4RN3U|3.0|My little sister asked me if I wanted anything from iTunes and I said \\"Some Nights\\" by Fun. I only meant the song, but she ended up buying the whole album instead. For the most part it's pretty good, and I don't really regret not clarifying that I didn't want the whole CD. Most of it isn't a lot like the two hits they've had, but are CDs ever?

B008EZVNO0|4.0|Van Morrison's last studio album, \\"Keep It Simple,\\" was released in 2008; a year later, he released \\"Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl.\\" And then ... three years of silence. Only once before in his career had Morrison let three years pass between albums; the gap was between \\"Veedon Fleece\\" in February 1974 and \\"A Period of Transition\\" in April 1977. And Morrison NEVER had gone four years between studio albums.<br /><br />So it was that, earlier in 2012, I was beginning to wonder if his muse had abandoned him at last. Furthermore, \\"Keep It Simple\\" had not proved to be one of his great records. One of the problems with it was the tepid songwriting; of the eleven tracks (twelve if you count \\"Little Village,\\" the live bonus track), the only one that really made an impression on me was \\"Behind the Ritual.\\"<br /><br />It gets worse. \\"Keep It Simple\\" had been preceded by \\"Pay the Devil,\\" Morrison's 2006 album on which he covered American country/western songs. That idea was every bit as problematic as it sounds.<br /><br />Nope, you have to go back to 2005, to \\"Magic Time,\\" to get to the last really fine Van Morrison record. Until now. Seven years later, Van is, at last, the Man again. \\"Born to Sing: No Plan B\\" is an apt title, because Morrison sounds more committed to his performances and songwriting than he has in a very long time.<br /><br />Morrison opens with a couple of medium-tempo rockers, \\"Open the Door (To Your Heart)\\" and \\"Goin' Down to Monte Carlo,\\" then swings right into the title track, which has a noticeable doo-wop feel that suits the lyrics perfectly. Certainly, Morrison sounds nostalgic here, but it's a nostalgia rooted in true love of music, and so escapes being cloying.<br /><br />\\"Close Enough for Jazz\\" is just that, as Morrison guides his band through a piece that blends R&B, rock, soul and jazz. It's quite pleasant even though it never really cuts loose the way it could have, though it ALMOST gets there during Paul Moran's all-too-brief piano solo.<br /><br />Morrison never has been the kind of topical songwriter that Bob Dylan or even Neil Young have been at times in their careers. So it comes as something of a surprise that three songs on \\"Born to Sing\\" sound so topical. \\"End of the Rainbow\\" warns that materialism cannot take the place of true spiritual rewards, while \\"If In Money We Trust\\" and \\"Educating Archie\\" both evince a keen awareness of how greed and envy can grow even uglier during hard economic times. \\"Where's God? Where's God?\\" Morrison sings over and over again during \\"If In Money We Trust,\\" and repeatedly rails against a capitalistic system controlled by \\"the global elite\\" in \\"Educating Archie.\\"<br /><br />I give this album four stars and not five for a couple reasons. First, Morrison could've worked a bit harder on the lyrics, so that we didn't get another dose of Grumpy Van complaining here and there about \\"backbiters,\\" \\"carpetbaggers\\" and other \\"enemies.\\" Second: On classic VM albums such as \\"Saint Dominic's Preview\\" and \\"Hymns to the Silence,\\" Morrison used his longer songs to explore the far ranges of his singing, to move so deeply into the music that he experienced a kind of transcendence that, in turn, was transmitted to the listener. \\"Born to Sing\\" offered three such opportunities, as \\"Goin' Down to Monte Carlo,\\" \\"If In Money We Trust\\" and \\"Pagan Heart\\" all clock in at eight minutes or so -- but Morrison holds onto himself too tightly, not fully trusting himself to reach for that strange, vibrant space.<br /><br />Still, this is a honey of a record, and yes, a definite return to form for a singer who turned 67 this August. Like the blues shouters and the jazz players and the R&B masters he's admired so long, Morrison has proved himself a survivor. It's so good to have him back.olo.<br /><br />Morrison never has been the kind of topical songwriter that Bob Dylan or even Neil Young have been at times in their careers.

B008ER9QLK|5.0|I had felt that Wagner's music was over-wrought and pretentious, and the staging of the two Ring cycles I had seen were creaky, 19th-century melodramas intriguing only for the most devoted Wagnerite.<br /><br />Then I saw this production of the DER RING DES NIGELUNGEN in HD, and my eyes and ears were opened to the blend of theatre and music that Wagner himself had sought. I saw no wing-and-drop painted scenery, no overweight singers standing still and watching the conductor's baton. I saw (thanks to Robert LePage) the Rhine River, mountain tops, walls of fire, forests, mines and forges, huts and bridges to Valhalla, all inhabited by gods, giants, mermaids, monsters and heroic warriors. I heard the Metropolitan Opera orchestra (conducted by James Levine and Fabio Luisi) tickle my ears with birdsong, caress them with love duets, and blast them with battles. Finally Wagner's music embodied by stagecraft!<br /><br />I am particularly intrigued by the fifth disc, WAGNER'S DREAM, which shows how LePage developed the machinery for the setting and how his actor-singers learned to fly and walk on huge moving set pieces--all the while creating characters and making sublime music.<br /><br />This is a set of DVDs to be treasured, and played over and over again.
B008RTE066|5.0|MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR was filmed in the fall of 1967, and was The Beatles' first major project after the death of manager Brian Epstein.  While the film's soundtrack (a double-EP in Britain, an 11-song album in America, which was also imported into the UK, where it was eventually released on cassette in 1973 and on LP in 1976) was an enormous success, the film was not.  It was first shown on the BBC on Boxing Day (26 December) 1967 in monochrome (most British viewers had black-and-white TV sets) and was not received well by the public, or by critics (\\"blatant rubbish\\" and \\"tasteless nonsense\\" were two of the milder descriptions).  A second colo(u)r broadcast appeared on BBC2 on 05 January 1968, but only the few Britons who had \\"colour\\" TVs saw it, and the damage was done.<br /><br />In America, both ABC and NBC withdrew their bids for a network broadcast of MMT; the film made its U.S. debut at New York's Fillmore East a few months later as part of a fundraising concert.  Over the years, Apple rented the film to colleges and indie movie theaters.  The film did not appear on American TV until it was syndicated in 1985, which was where I saw it for the first time.  A few poor-quality VHS tapes appeared in the early-to-mid-1980s, but the first proper video release was in 1988, when Apple and MPI Home Video released [[ASIN:6301095294 an official VHS tape]], with a restored soundtrack by George Martin.<br /><br />In 1997, MPI released the film on DVD; I own [[ASIN:B00004U0ZP The Beatles DVD Collector's Set]] that was released in 2000, which contains the original MPI DVD versions of MMT, HELP, THE FIRST U.S. VISIT (both of which have since been restored and re-released by Apple), and the Phil Collins documentary [[ASIN:6305073694 The Making of A Hard Day's Night]], which was upgraded in 2014 (see below). MMT has been out of print for years, although it has been bootlegged, but has just been re-released by Apple in DVD and Blu-ray format, as well as the Deluxe Collector's Edition, which I purchased.<br /><br />To be honest, the film is no CITIZEN KANE or even A HARD DAY'S NIGHT.  But it is a good piece of entertainment, and contains seven terrific Beatles songs:  the title track, \\"The Fool On The Hill,\\" the instrumental \\"Flying,\\" George Harrison's \\"Blue Jay Way,\\" the classic \\"I Am The Walrus,\\" which appears in full stereo all the way through, and Paul's \\"Your Mother Should Know,\\" which is the film's closing production number.  \\"Hello Goodbye\\" plays over the closing credits.  The Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band's rendition of \\"Death Cab For Cutie\\" (featuring future Monty Python member and Rutle Neil Innes) is also an hilarious classic.  One of the outtake scenes, Nat Jackley's romp around the pool with pretty girls, directed by John Lennon, features an unreleased Lennon-McCartney instrumental called \\"Shirley's Wild Accordion,\\" played by accordionist Shirley Jackson.  The stereo and 5.1 surround-sound soundtrack is excellent, and the picture restoration is good too, although some of the colors have faded over time.  There are also four deleted scenes that are hidden on the main menu in the form of \\"Easter eggs\\"; two of them can be accessed by going to the \\"Play Film\\" option and clicking on the up-arrow or left-arrow key on your remote; the other two can be accessed by going to the \\"Audio Options\\" option and using either the up-arrow or right-arrow key.  Sir Paul McCartney's Director's Commentary can either be listened to, viewed with subtitles if you don't want to override the film soundtrack, or both.  There are two sets of subtitles; one for the main film, the other for Paul's commentary (11 languages in all).  The subtitles also apply to the special features.<br /><br />See Amazon's product description for more on the special features on the DVD and Blu-ray.  The Deluxe Edition is worth having for the additional 60-page book, including essays by Sir Paul McCartney and Barry Miles, and an \\"itinerary\\" of the scenes shot in the film.  There is also a reproduction of the original mono vinyl double-EP that was issued in the UK in 1967.  This brings my MMT collection full circle; I purchased the stereo EP years ago as an import; I have three versions of the vinyl album - the original 1967 Capitol LP (with three fake stereo Duophonic songs), the all-stereo German issue from 1971 (with the pink cover) that was the template for the later CD release, and the 1976 UK Parlophone pressing that is identical to Capitol's.  I also have the original CD from 1987, the stereo/mono CD version of the EP, issued in 1992 as part of the [[ASIN:B000008DB7 Compact Disc EP Collection]], and the remastered mono and stereo CDs from 2009.<br /><br />While it's not the best film, it's worth having, especially if you're a Beatle fan.  Stripped of the dialogue, it would make an excellent long-form music video (unfortunately, there is no \\"songs-only\\" option).  4 stars for content; 5 stars for packaging and quality.<br /><br />Hopefully, if director Michael Lindsay-Hogg is right, the elusive LET IT BE will finally be out in 2013, and that a newly-restored 50th Anniversary edition of A HARD DAY'S NIGHT will be released in 2014 (the [[ASIN:B0000542D2 2002 Miramax version]] sucks; until 2014, I watched the older [[ASIN:B000LCF3HM MPI DVD]]). UPDATE: Still no LET IT BE, but the updated [[ASIN:B00J2PQZEY A Hard Day's Night (Criterion Collection) (Blu-ray + DVD)]] was finally issued in 2014, and includes an upgraded version of [[ASIN:6305073694 The Making of A Hard Day's Night]].so a reproduction of the original mono vinyl double-EP that was issued in the UK in 1967.

B003VANOFY|1.0|The headset itself is okay.  It's usable with the default windows drivers, however changing the volume freezes up the windows taskbar.

Logitech support was useless, the freezing issue is well-known on the Logitech forums yet support still reads off their script, providing \\"solutions\\" that other users have already confirmed are useless.<br /><br />I'd recommend against purchasing this headset.  I ended up returning the G930 and getting the Corsair Vengeance 2000.  It's slightly more expensive but the drivers work, it feels great, and the sound quality is better.
0345803493|1.0|OMG! Shallow, primitive book. I'm sorry for every tree that was chopped to print this \\"erotic thriller\\". Please, save forests! If you want to read it, please buy Kindle one, because it's such a big-big-big waste of money, time and paper.
0439023513|4.0|Spoiler alert - contains specific references to specific parts of the book.<br />Could this have possibly gotten any darker or more disturbing?  I suppose after having seen Harry Potter get darker and darker and some of the episodes of Star Wars showing the killing of childern, I should not be surprised. But honestly I thought that this went over the top.<br />The tone of the book changes to an adult voice with obvious analogies to the take over of communism from imperialist states (Russia and China for example) and it has obvious references to the use of children in warfare - Korea, Viet Nam and now the Middle East. Why should I be horrified?  I was in spite of the current and historic realities.<br />If I was a parent I would consider carefully before I let a younger teenager much less a tween read this. It has too many horrific scenes. This is no longer a gladiator type story it is about government manipulation at the most repulsive levels. It is also not particularly redeaming. Harry Potter was redeaming because of the end and the overcoming of evil, so was Star Wars. This was only slightly.<br />I had heard that the end was disappointing to people. Why? Actually given the circumstances and the hints given all along, it should not have been. I predicted Katniss would kill Coin - that was a little too obvious. I was surprised by the final meeting with the President. I was also not too surprised by who she would up with.<br />I could also not put this one down. Though horrified I had to read to the end and that makes a good book.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|This movie is interesting because of a deeper concept that is never overtly presented.  There is a theme about whether life itself is important or whether one persons life is important.  Many questions remain unanswered: why did the Engineers want to destroy human life on earth, whether religion had anything to do with this, why was the mission leaders medical pod tailored for a man when she was a woman, why the android was the closest thing to a son the CEO would ever have, and why the captain who was so apt to sacrifice himself was also so pius as to celebrate Christmas before feasting after hyper sleep.<br /><br />This movie left me wondering and I like that.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Mark Owen (not his real name, of course) just had to give us this book.  First of all, so that he could  write every detail, in sequence to give us the action we expected.  To let us know how it felt to be ready mentally and physically. And what it took to get in and out without a major accident. This was, I believe, more important to him that to \\"set the record straight\\" that he did not use classified information that could have put anyone in danger at any time.  If there was a leak, and we know there was, it was not from this book, or material used in this book.  I believe him.  He is a SEAL and that is enough for me.<br /><br />NO EASY DAY was another of the great books on shelves now, and it ranks right up there with \\"THE RED CIRCLE\\", \\"AMERICAN SNIPER\\", \\"SOLE SURVIVOR\\", and \\"SEAL TEAM SIX\\" .  Owen leaves out nothing if you are reading because you love knowing  about the SEALs brotherhood.  Required reading for all young men who want to excel physically and mentally in the military.
B001NLKS16|1.0|Oh, dear heaven, this was awful.  No real narrative, just a constant round of \\"Dean's birthday,\\" \\"Sammy's birthday,\\" \\"Wedding anniversary,\\" \\"Anniversary of death,\\" interspersed with scanty dry arcane knowledge and hints of stories.<br /><br />It seriously read like someone scrambling for words in National Novel Writing Month.  Every anniversary, we heard what was traditionally associated with it (wood, paper, lace, whatever).  Didn't seem to have any reason for being there except to pad the word count.  No reflections on Mary herself, or what made her unique.<br /><br />I loved John Winchester in the series, but this did not sound like his voice at all.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|As always, a gem of literature, but now in new media formats. Just as enjoyable as it has been all the life ...
1469984202|5.0|An absolutely amazing book. Mr. Howey is a great story teller.<br />I started reading it three days ago and just finished.<br />I've been a sci-fi fan longer than most folk have been alive, and this is one book I know I'll be re-reading.<br />I know I'll definitely be buying the other books of this series.<br />Guess I'm going to have to add  Hugh Howey to my list of favorite authors.<br />Couldn't hurt. :)
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I got this app so I can easily get 2 the Bible since I go to a Private Christain school, my Bible is there. the thing is, you need wifi to get access, u can download some if you make an account, but u cant download the NIV version. I don't have wifi at church where I have it yet.

B000W21ER4|4.0|The title of the review says it all! Undone is one of my favorites of all time.  Favorite Weezer album!
1401322786|5.0|As usual Mitch Albom shows why he is one of the best authors of our time. Read it all at once if you are able, it won't take long. When finished, give it to someone else to read, say a prayer and go for a walk.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I really love this game. Its very fun and addictive. My favorite thing about this game is you can play for a short time and still enjoy it. Have fun.
B005LAII08|5.0|From the commercials about Brave I was a bit iffy about it.  I took my 2 year old to see it because I had heard rave reviews of it and it would be her first time experiencing a Disney Princess movie in the theater.  My daughter loved this movie.  She has the attention span of a nat and she sat through the entire movie without fidgeting.  There was a bit of adult humor in the movie, but it was really funny and after all the movie is PG.  My daughter went around after seeing the movie telling people that \\"the momma bear ate fishys\\" and she always wants the Brave toys that she sees in Walmart.  I think that between Brave and Tangled Disney has officially recover from making that horrible Princess and the Frog movie.
B005DOKIYG|4.0|This product is exactly as advertised -- and does what it says it does.<br />I returned this because I found a product on Amazon that was more suitable for my use.<br />I bought, \\"AmazonBasics Leather Folio Cover with Multi-Angle Adjustable Stand for Kindle Fire, Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0 (Black)\\" on Amazon.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|i love this app!!! I love the different plans and that you can take notes. i love that everything will transfer between devices too since i have 3 different devices i use.
0525952926|5.0|Another excellent book by Ken Follett. I am only half way through but cant put the book down. Ken has a knack of writing history books that are not boaring but actually gripping. Cant wait for the third book.
B0010SKTRA|5.0|I bought \\"Your Inner Fish\\" several years ago and lost it after completing 3/4 of it.  I keep telling myself that I don't really need to finish it - that what was left didn't warrant the purchase price.  Here I am, years later still wanting to read the rest and reread what I had already read.  So I am justifying it by telling myself that buying the Kindle version is different since I can easily go back to it over and over without filling my house with more books.  It is a great read, obviously worth twice the price to me.
1609611543|5.0|This book has helped me and my wife so much. Dr. William Davis did a splendid job explaining the health results of the genetically altered wheat found in our foods today.  My wife usually works out 3-5 times a week, yet she was struggling to keep her weight under 115#. She had resigned herself to getting older and the weight got really close to 120#. Her favorite outfits no longer were comfortable. Then I found Wheat Belly on one of my Twitter health club feeds. We both devoured the book. She used to eat Triscuits, thinking they were a great way to get her whole grains and avoid the sugar and fat in other cracker choices. In less than three weeks after getting virtually all wheat, including Triscuits, out of our diets, my wife dropped to 110#. She is now 105# and wearing her old jeans and tops that she loves. Meanwhile, I dropped 15#. This morning I hit 179#, a number I have not seen since college. The Wheat Belly book is a fabulous book for all to read. I consider it a life saving text. We have recommended it to  many friends and family. I also gave a copy of the book to one of my attorneys as a gift to help him cope with his weight and diabetes issues.
0307474259|4.0|If you're gaining weight as you get older you've got to read this book.  This book has alot of answers to \\"Why We Get Fat\\" and the history of how obesity has been perceived by professionals dating back to the early 1900's.  You don't have to have a medical background to understand the key principles to \\"Why We Get Fat\\".
B00992CF6W|5.0|super fun! You have a house/houses that you build and you can build many other things too! Even though it is $6.99 it is well worth buying this game.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I love match three games! I like the puzzles in between, too. the story is a little cheesy, but it is a good game.
0812992784|5.0|I read portions of this book in the New Yorker and was hooked. Rushdie lived in forced isolation and reached an understanding of forces much larger than himself. There is humor and grace (sorry to use a religious term for a book by an atheist) in his telling of how he reconciled the social isolation by relying on his gifts as a writer.<br /><br />This is an outstanding achievement. It illustrates how a work of literature can speak the truth about a moment in history and that poses an enormous threat to the author. His unique circumstances unleashed a creative passion that can only resonate for the rest of us if that writer has outstanding talent and drive.<br /><br />In writing Satanic Verses, Rushdie gained an understanding of complex political forces. His view of religion as essentially political, gave him intellectual survival skills to survive a war waged against freedom of speech and freedom not be religious. To read this book, is to recognize an enormous and enduring talent. In my mind he is a contemporary Dante.
B0040QYROK|5.0|Metropolis is a silent film classic with an interesting history. It was edited down from its original full length version and, somehow, all known prints of the original full length version were lost or destroyed.<br /><br />In the 1990s a copy of the original full length version was found in South America. This copy was on 16mm film and was not in pristine condition. But it was the only known copy of the full length original so a project was undertaken to restore a complete version of the full length original version using material from the 16mm South American copy.<br /><br />This is the restored version of the full length original film.<br /><br />The restoration is very well done. It's obvious where material from the 16mm South American copy has been edited in but the restoration looks very good.<br /><br />This movie is an essential film for movie history fans. This restored full length version is the one to buy.
B00009RDGA|5.0|An excellent movie - filmed in black and white intentionally, which doesn't detract at all from the appeal of the movie.  Strange now-a-days to see a young girl smoking, but this is set back during prohibition.  As good as I remembered it from decades ago.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read this book in two days I could not put it down.  I was glad to see that this second book had a completely different story line than Fifty shades of grey, because the first book had a lot of similarities. I can't wait for the next book to come out in December.
B006O7XOOW|3.0|We got this toy just as our daughter was beginning to pull herself up to a standing position, and we like its stability.<br /><br />After two months, our now 11-month old daughter still interacts with this toy every day.  But she doesn't use it as intended.  She likes playing with the balls, or hitting the lever or roller to have the ballcano play its tunes.  I agree with other reviewers that the balls often come out of the legs on their way down, especially the leg with the single large protrusion.<br /><br />Besides the ball leakage feature, I think the toy is well-designed: the ballcano platform is spring-loaded, so there is no pinch danger.  The toy will emit a short few notes about 30 seconds after it finishes the last disco tune, as if to say, \\"I'm still here, come play with me.\\"  I prefer the lower volume level; but the higher volume level isn't too loud.<br /><br />I like the simplicity of this toy's features; yet the ballcano's namesake action is obscure enough that our baby hasn't yet figured out the cause-and-effect yet.  (We haven't put the balls back to the top platform very much.)<br /><br />Update: After our daughter began to walk, she could also climb on top of the ballcano.  She still doesn't use it as intended.  We use rechargeable (eneloop) batteries, and a single charge lasted almost five or six months of play.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Get this game it is amazing. definately one for the favorite section!! It is just as good as angry birds
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Great game with nice graphics. Challenging but not frustatingly difficult. Very user friendly. I like the colors and the manner in which you advance through the game.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is a solid game that doesn't try to get money from you at every turn.  It's well worth the full purchase price, as it has smooth graphics, unobtrusive music, and logical game play.  Can't wait until the next one.
B004LROUNG|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by the end of this book - so much so that I spent an extra hour at the gym to finish it.  I thought it started slowly, but eventually the \\"can't stop\\" feeling kicked in. While I liked David Zinc, I wasn't a fan of Finley or Figg. I really didn't like DeAnna - I was mixed on Rochelle. You knew the story was going to have a happy ending - it's what Grisham does best. I liked that he kept us on our toes as to what the resolution would be. As I read this over a few weeks, I'd forgotten about the search for Nasty Teeth by the time David found them on his way back from rehab. Also liked the tie-in back to Abner's and Miss Spence and her Pearl Harbors. Nice conclusion there. The sap in me was glad he god justice for Thuya and their family - and glad he came out on top professionally. I'm still perplexed why he went on the sidebar with Krayoxx only to have the verdict still come back so quickly. That seemed a little rushed. But overall, great read. One of Grisham's best in a while.
B008O9V4C2|4.0|I've been a Steely Dan fan from the early seventies beginning with Can't Buy A Thrill. I've got all the remastered early discs the latter ones Two Against Nature and Everything Must Go along with the Mobile Fidelity Gold Master Discs of Aja and Gaucho. Fagens solo disc are all together different. With respect to his last two, Morph The Cat and Sunken Condos, I've burnt a compilation from those two. After dropping Brite Nitegown and Morph The Cat (reprise) from said CD, Memorabilia and Out of the Ghetto from Sunken Condos, I've got right at 79 minutes of outstanding music. I'll never miss the songs that were dropped. You should NEVER use the words Brite Nitegown or Memorabilia in a song.
B004UID2LC|2.0|it was great, but then just stopped working.  ended up deleting it.  now I've got to find a new program.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I really enjoyed this blu-ray version of the movies.  The picture and sound quality surpass what I experienced originally when I saw them in theaters.  Thanks Amazon for this great deal!!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Watched Prometheus again a few nights ago (spoilers ahead): it sucked much less than the first time when I watched it in the theater, mainly because of the existence of a deleted scene where the Engineer actually has a brief conversation with old Weyland before commencing to violence. I really hate that Scott felt the need to delete this from the theatrical release in order to, I presume, just make the whole thing more cryptic and mysterious - or rather, just far less comprehensible and enjoyable. Another deleted scene drew out the suspense (otherwise non-existent) of the Engineer looking for the last remaining crew member near the end. No idea why that one was deleted either, as it established a much more deliberate, less haphazard pacing at the end of the film.<br /><br />Plotholes still abound, and the romantic chemistry (or rather the complete and utter lack thereof) between the two lead scientists was thrown into even starker contrast this go-around, particularly when the gruesome death of one and the consequent hysterical reaction of the other as she witnessed it utterly failed to evince any sympathetic emotion whatsoever. I recall thinking \\"I *want* to care, I really do.\\"<br /><br />But certain other scenes such as that gargantuan fiery ship falling out of the sky in a slow majestic roll somehow go some way toward making up for the emotional and narrative lacunae. It's just a sci-fi movie after all, not high art nor some grand statement on Life, the Universe and Everything as the \\"engineered\\" hype would have it. Scott said in an interview prior to release \\"This movie is all about everything. I come from the All About Everything school.\\" Feel free to get over yourself, Sir Ridley! And just let us enjoy your work for what it is.<br /><br />I should also state that, though my connection could easily have supported 1080 or 720p (I bought an instant rental), for some reason it streamed at a far more degraded resolution. And I could find no way to fix that, as Amazon automatically determines the best resolution for your connection speed (or so they say). Phooey.on automatically determines the best resolution for your connection speed (or so they say). Phooey.
B00200K2UG|5.0|I should have written this review a long time ago. This bag is very versatile. I use this bag as storage when at home, and use it when I need to take all of my equipment with me. It has a ton of pockets which holds batteries, other equip, and even a small tablet/laptop. My biggest suggestion is to find a box at home that has the same dimensions, and walk around with it for a while to see if you like the general size before you purchase. Also check with airport regulations to see carry on size requirements before purchase.<br /><br />Lastly (my favorite part), I love the zippers on the top compartment under the flap already secured by the 4 locking tethers. These do a great job keeping dust out of the case. A+ product. Great comfortable shoulder strap.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Good followup to her first book in the series. It's intense and unexpected. Can't wait for the next one to come out!
B008HK3XKO|4.0|The case is sturdy....a little pricy for the material...but fits tight, and secure. Nothing flashy, but gets the job done.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is a must for me because I need a weather report several times a day.  I have found the temps and weather condition forecast to be very accurate.  I would recommend this App to anyone who is looking for a good weather source.  After using this app for a little longer I started having problems getting an up to date weather report.  Part of the time I can't get the correct 10 day weather. I have three locations that I keep up with, and sometimes one or more of them are from one to three days behind. When I first started to use this app I did not have this problem, now it is a problem almost daily.  I am considering uninstalling this app because of this issue.
0316228532|1.0|After plowing through the first 300 pages of this disappointing novel, I would say that J K Rowling should stick with young peoples' literature.  Adult literature to her is a lot of profanity in both American words and British words, teenage libidos running wild, and all the other evil deeds as listed by other reviewers.  There appears only to be hate, self-centered egos, and highly dysfunctional people.  There is no mystery, romance or even steamy sex scenes, the drama is even lacking...just raw emotions of getting even with those you have a distaste for whether it be parent, spouse, child or friend.  So many characters it is often hard to keep track of who is who.  The plot line is just who will fill a vacated councilman's seat and the \\"fight\\" to fill it.  This book makes our American political muckraking look tame.  Don't waste your money.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Wow!! This is one of the most amazing stories ever written. Couldn't put this book down. God bless the navy seals and all the men and women who protect this country.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I don't know what else to say other than...WOW! The second book of this series, Reflected in You, had my skin tingling, tears building and stomach flopping. I know that none of the books that I read between now and May, when the next book comes out, will even compare. Thank you Sylvia Day for writing the amazing Crossfire series!
B0063FGG22|4.0|This movie is one of Hollywood's most enjoyable thrillers it is ever better in this State-of-Art Restoration.<br /><br />  This is also Carry Grants fourth and final teaming with the Master of Suspense Alfred Hitchcock.<br /><br /> This movie is a all time classic. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the older classic movies.
1476715904|5.0|This is a wonderfully beautiful story, even with the ups and (many) downs of life. It made you feel the emotions of the characters.  I have cried and laughed when reading this story.  I would absolutely recommend the trilogy to all.

1476712042|5.0|I am so in love with this book, and can't wait for the sequel!!!  I am having major withdrawls from the characters!
1451627289|5.0|First off, I should say that I was a teeny bit worried... The first book I ordered on amazon seems to have had a glue failure so I wasn't sure if that was an isolated problem or would be the norm. Worries were totally unfounded:) I received this perfectly great quality hard cover edition of a newly released book and am fully satisfied. It arrived super fast and it is put together as it should be. Also, it turns out to be a great book, I'm a huge fan of King and love 97% of his work. I sometimes am disappointed when he writes something a little different than I expect from his books, this one though was awesome!!!
0688002307|5.0|I first read this book as required material in college. Then by pure accident, I unwittingly became the same main character in a real-life scenario that parallelled the story line. Now that I've left analytical chemistry behind to become a writer myself, I wanted a fresh copy of this most ingenious novel to read again.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Find myself cooking/crafting something from here every week. Also love seeing what my friends like!  Love it and spend waaayyy too much time on it.
0316228532|2.0|This is a very disappointing outing by J.K. Rowling.  I found the story boring and a tedious read at best.  I had read some of the other reviews of 'The Casual Vacancy' after starting the book but still felt promise for a good read, after all this is J.K. Rowling.  Other reviewers stated you needed to read at least half of the book before the storyline would pick up.  I didn't find this to be so.  Even at the end I wondered why I had bothered with the effort to plod on when I could have been reading something much better.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like hidden object games and this is a good one.  It has different rooms to explore and if you repeat a room the things aren't always set up in the same places.
0765322889|4.0|I began this book with some caution, as I've heard mixed reviews. I was wary of the brutality for which it was praised as reminiscent of George R.R. Martin, as that is my least favorite thing about him. The lengthy cast list at the beginning was a little bit intimidating. There are a lot of characters in this. They initially don't seem connected to one another, but everything comes together as the story progresses.<br /><br />This was a very well-crafted story. By the end, I was delighted with the way things fit together and all of my questions were answered. I enjoyed all of the characters, which is actually very unusual for just about any book. I found Ganoes Paran initially hard to get used to, because he just had the feel of a very generic main character, but he grew on me as the story progressed. I was immediately interested in Sorry's plotline, and not disappointed there. Tattersail was the character to whom I was the most attached, and about her, I cannot say much because I want to avoid spoilers. The Bridgeburners as a group were fairly likable, even when I wasn't always sure I agreed with what they were doing.<br /><br />I'm not entirely sure of my feelings on the book's treatment of some of the female characters. Sorry, Lorn and Tattersail were very human and well-developed, I thought. I would have liked to see some human side of Lady Simtal. She was practically a caricature of a loathsome, foul temptress whom the audience is supposed to hate. That archetype is a bit misogynistic for my taste, so it could have been handled a bit better. I'm not sure I can recommend this to my feminist friends, because of this. That said, the rest of the book was enjoyable, and she was only a small part of the story.<br /><br />This is not the sort of book that's for everyone, but I was incredibly impressed with the depth of world-building and the incredible detail put into this fascinating world.

B000067IZ3|1.0|I can never understand why professionals like jumpy shots and be so obsessed with it that they make movies using this amateur \\"technique\\", if you can even call it a technique. Hey, I did not need any trainings to be shooting jumpy videos shots that make everybody sick even when I was a kid.<br /><br />I tried watching this DVD more than two times but I could never go more then a few minutes before quitting. I became so dizzy, not just because of the unstable video shots, but also because they kept changing shooting angles and perspectives every second or two. I almost threw up.<br /><br />I actually bought this DVD nearly 10 years ago and hoping that I could one day watch it to the end after I could overcome this kind of motion sickness caused by their style of video shooing. But, I could never. I am finally giving up. Money wasted on this DVD.

006092988X|5.0|To say I was pleasantly surprised by this book is an understatement. I was looking to get out of my reading comfort zone as a 48-year-old man. It more than lives up to its billing as a classic. I draw a parallel between it and \\"The Good Earth\\" by Pearl S. Buck. It just says so much about so many things over the course of the story (roughly set in the years 1900-1918).<br />The commonality shared by this book and \\"The Good Earth\\" -- besides being a story that is told over a period of years -- is family and enduring times of hardship and poverty through hard work. Whereas Wang Lung (in \\"The Good Earth\\") was connected to the land (in China), young, lonely and intelligent Francie Nolan is ambivalently connected to her neighborhood in Manhattan.<br />Both books show the cruelty of fate and other people (especially the young in this book) to the poor and downtrodden and both serve to educate the reader to different times. There is also a lot a dynamic perception of family in both.<br />I'm used to more immediate, dialogue- and action-driven stories and wanting to change that is what drove me to this book.<br />At times the story appears as if there is no plot or trajectory, but that is where Betty Smith's craft took over. All of the seemingly disparate events depicted over time fit together like a jigsaw, building and enhancing characterization of its literary denizens along the way. It leaves the reader filled with hope and the feeling of love -- again, something I'm not normally gushing about. Which says a lot about the quality of the book. It's filled with truth.<br />If you are into superficial action books, stay away from it. If you want to look at a unique time and place and enlarge your literary boundaries, then by all means buy it. I don't think one needs to be a young student to get the most out of it, though it serves well in that capacity. I think one just should want to look into humanity and a different time and place (and the more things change, the more they stay the same). To be clear, I never thought I'd find a book of this kind nearly as good as \\"The Good Earth.\\" This is right up there. Truly inspiring and poignant. I highly recommend it. It will stick with you.

B000W91RUG|5.0|I'm an American who lives in Japan and have been a faithful Amazon customer for over a decade now, spending thousands of dollars for American DVDs. Amazon has always been a wonderful place to shop--they have always offered me 3 options for shipping--instead of the cheapest and slowest, or the most costly and quickest, I usually opt for the middle choice. DVDs arrive in less than 2 weeks, and it doesn't cost the world.<br />Recently, Amazon actually sent me an e-mail to announce that DVDs of Seasons 1-3 of Big Bang Theory could be bought in a package deal for a reasonable price. When I went to order, however, it was a different story. I was told that I could order seasons 1 and 2 separately, but that I could NOT order the Seasons 1, 2, and 3  as a group, because of where I live! So I gave up, and just got Seasons 1 and 2. The other day, I ordered Seasons 3 and 4 and 5 all separately. This time, there were no shipping options available. The DVDs would be shipped at the snail-slow cheapest speed, like it or not. So now, I get to wait over a month. Yippee. Gee thanks, Amazon.<br /><br />Shopping at Amazon used to be fun.  Now, I hesitate to buy stuff, because \\"what new goofy regulations will I have to cope with next?\\" Amazon's considerate service used to be stellar, and their recent ways of doing things really pale in comparison. Maybe it was too good to last.<br /><br />As for Big Bang Theory itself, I accidentally came across it on Japanese TV and loved it.  This is the first American comedy show I've seen since I Love Lucy that is a completely fresh and new approach to situation comedy. I'm so glad it's available on DVD, even if I will have to wait quite a while for my copy.

B00910Y1OQ|4.0|We've all played a million match 3 games before. What can be different? Well the twist in this one is that you have a time limit in which to get specific non matchable blocks to the bottom row. The challenge is made greater by locked blocks, frozen blocks, empty spaces and coming blocks. Locked blocks simply can't be swapped. Frozen blocks are like locked blocks except they don't fall when blocks below them break. Both of these can be turned to regular blocks by matching with them. Empty space cannot hold blocks this limiting the ways you can make matches. And finally the cement blocks which cannot be destroyed and force you to avoid them when moving your special blocks to the bottom.<br /><br />Thankfully you have a few powerups to help you beat the timer as well.<br /><br />If you like match 3 games... you'll probably enjoy the extra strategy this one requires.<br /><br />No force closes ever, and the game saves progress automatically.
B004SIPA4G|4.0|Sin City has made me more aware of the many entertaining films Frank Miller has written, produced, and or directed. I just put Sin City's writer,Frank Miller, together with a film and script that I have greatly admired since the late 1990's titled Ronin. This film \\"Sin City\\" depicts the dark side of life in a lite style manner. It reminds me of taking  a \\"R\\" rated movie such as Roger Rabbit to a \\"R\\"<br />plus more violence rated status of the same genre. The special make-up work by K.N.B. EFX GROUP,INC. is excellent. I am so impressed by their work I felt compelled to make sure I give credit to the proper group of artist which created this work.

034580404X|5.0|Like some others have said, you are either going to love it or hate it.  And I loved it!  And to think that I almost didn't give it a chance.<br /><br />When I had turned to the first page and saw that it was written in first person, I groaned and immediately closed the book, because I normally cannot get into novels written from this perspective, but then I thought, well, I paid almost $30 bucks for this set, so I'd better read it!  After I got through the first chapter, I was hooked.<br /><br />If you only read the first book, you will think that this is just about BDSM, especially after reading through the \\"Contract\\", but if you were to read all three, you will see the big picture.  This is basically a romantic story about Christian and Ana's journey, which of course, has its ups and downs, as well as surprising twists and turns that are tied to Christian's past.  There was actually more to the story than I had expected, which was evident after getting to the end of the second book.<br /><br />Although the main focus was on Christian's character and his baggage, what they both shared were similar inadequacy issues.  Christian does not think that he is worthy of being loved due to being abused as a child, while Ana constantly questions what Christian sees in her, as she does not believe that she is capable of holding the attention of such a gorgeous and successful man, especially when he has specific needs that she felt she could not fulfill.<br /><br />There is more romance and less of the BDSM in the second and third books, but always LOTS of sex.  I did find myself skipping over some of the sex scenes, as it did get somewhat repetitive.  This however, did not take away from the story.  The complex characters of Christian and Ana were developed at the perfect pace, not too slowly or quickly, which made the story believable.  Although the ending was a happy one, it was not the cheesy \\"Hollywood\\" kind.<br /><br />The only thing that really bothered me was the overuse of the word \\"murmur\\" in the first book.  However, I found this word to be virtually absent in the second and third books, but possibly replaced by the word \\"whisper\\", which did not annoy me as much.<br /><br />There were two scenes that stuck out in my mind in this book.  Without going into too much detail, the first one was the \\"Submissive Christian\\" scene when he thought Ana was going to leave him.  I found myself just as shocked as Ana.<br /><br />Another significant scene for me was a pretty ironic one.  The one and only time that Ana had used a safeword on Christian was when he was pleasuring her and then depriving her of an orgasm out of revenge, which caused her not physical pain, but emotional pain.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the email exchanges between Christian and Ana.  They were amusing, witty, and sometimes romantic!  I felt like this was when the characters' personalities really came out, which I fell in love with.<br /><br />I just wished I hadn't finished the books so quickly!  I can't wait until the movie comes out!use of the word \\"murmur\\" in the first book.

0739352962|5.0|As a commuter, I drive 2 hours a day. Audio books keep me sane. This collection of George R.R. Martin's ranks up there with [[ASIN:0143142372 The Pillars of the Earth]] and  [[ASIN:1402516274 The Lord of the Rings Trilogy Gift Set]]. Roy Dotrice does an overall excellent job as reader; using his flexible and wide ranging voice to bring the characters to life. Occasionally he missteps and confuses a character's voice, (probably unnoticeable to most listeners) but I am able to distinguish the voices and keep the characters clear, for the most part---there are many, many different personages.<br />I had never even heard of Game of Thrones until the HBO series aired. Loved that too, but the books, as usual, delve far deeper and truly take the listener into the world of the seven kingdoms. This was a great purchase that has and will continue to give me many hours of enjoyment. I am looking forward to books (audio cds) 6&7.<br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />**Update 3/30/13**<br />I am halfway through [[ASIN:0449011909 A Storm of Swords: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Three (Game of Thrones)]]and I am even more enthusiastic than before. This reading is monumental. The story line is complex. The majesty of this epic is brilliant. Roy Dotrice is a master reader; right up there with Frank Muller. 5 stars for both.<br /><br />**Update 4/30/13**<br />Finished A Storm of Swords. What an epic. I am very exited about [[ASIN:0449011917 A Feast for Crows: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Four]]. If you haven't already purchased either the books or the audio cd's you are missing what of the great literary feats of all time.<br /><br />**Update 8/16/13**<br />Back to school so commuting means book 4. So far lots of new characters. Martin has a way of introducing new characters and at first the listener is completely in the dark, BUT then he ties it all in with a sentence or two. It's quite masterful. Dotrice is an excellent reader.<br /><br />**Update 8/27/13**<br />I am about 1/3 of the way through  [[ASIN:0449011917 A Feast for Crows: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Four]] and I am compelled to make these criticisms regarding the reading of the story. Ray Dotrice, whom I have already lauded as an accomplished reader, is using different voice characterizations for Arya, Varys, and Eddard. And he has altered the pronunciation of Catelyn, now using a long a, instead of a short a. I am most assuredly picking nits, but I dote on intricacies such as these. This does NOT in any way detract from the magnificence of the story and Book 4 continues the saga without missing a beat.<br /><br />**Update 10/10/13**<br />Finished  [[ASIN:0449011917 A Feast for Crows: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Four]] and was satisfied. There are just a few references to the Dornish and it can be confusing.

Luckily, Tyrion Lannister has returned. IMO he is one of the most entertaining characters, along with Jaime, Daenerys Targaryen, and Brienne.

B003U6BE8I|5.0|This is a great addition to my classroom. We read the novel as a class and watch the movie afterwards. It's a great way to have the students practice comparison writing and they enjoy the reward of a movie.
B00846REIS|4.0|At first when I read the reviews and the summary of the book, I though this sounds like a fifty shades, however when I started it I quickly realized it wasn't anywhere close! I really enjoyed this book and soon read the second one within a few hours of finishing this one.  The story line was great although there are a few parts that I wanted to pull my hair out.  I would say if you liked fifty shades this is a must read.  I only wished I had read all three book of this trilogy back to back because waiting for the third book to come out is killing me! 2 more months!

But the thing I didn't like was that it was so much money. It was worth it for me because my sister loves it. But it might not be worth it for you. If you don't have a little one at home, or if you do and they are not that into coloring, then don't get it. But I did and I'm not sorry!

B00005Y7KX|5.0|I was surprised at the total use of theatrical magic that this production revealed!  The singing, the acting, the lighting, the set design.  It all came together to create a brilliant production and a brilliant recorded performance. How could I forget the dancing!  This performance is a masterpiece of the performing arts.  The production was perfectly cast with the most thrilling performers.  What is most important about this particular production is that it is timeless.  The costumes don't give away any special time in history.  Costuming is another one of the brilliant aspects of this show.  I wish I had discovered this DVD a long time ago.  It reveals the most beautiful and also the most horrible of human behavior.  The characters come to life before us through the fantastic performances of its professional and gifted cast.  This DVD is a must for anyone who loves music and literature.  It is yet another piece of evidence that the French are the best!
B003N0XDT4|5.0|I love the amp it made my dt770 pro sounds so much better on laptop or iphone. The bass is more controlled and everything else is less muddy. It also made my ultrasone 750 pro sound even better with the bass boost function. It makes me wonder how good e17 can be when e7 is already this good. Worth every penny spent! Please do yourself a favor before you upgrade your headphone upgrade the amp first specially when you don't have DAC or proper amp for your headphone, it will save you money. Plus, you will need this eventually anyway.

PROMETHEUS pushes the limit of creation theory by exploring the true origins of mankind.  the ideas put forth in this movie are based on ancient knowledge, not brainwashing religions.  it requires intelligence to appreciate this movie... the plot flows quickly thru complex theories and assumes that you can follow.  if you got lost, then you better relearn your history.  this movie is awesome... i can't wait for the sequel.  all you haters who still think the pyramids were built by slaves with chisels... elementary school is over kids!  time to grow up

B001HBYHFA|5.0|I am a Sci-Fi fan, but it is often difficult to find really great, non-cheesy shows. The Firefly series was truly great; it has extremely high-level characters, acting and writing mixed with edge-of-your-seat action sequences. The only flaw was that it was cancelled much too soon. Without this movie, the series would have left the viewer hanging, with several vital plot twists left unresolved. This movie takes care of that. As others here have wisely pointed out, see this movie only AFTER watching the series. Then, after watching the last episode and feeling frustrated as all Firefly fans were, cue up this movie and watch the magic as Joss Whedon does a very satisfying job of wrapping it all up. It doesn't all resolve as I might have wanted it to--there is some tragedy here--but if you liked the series, you owe it to yourself to see this movie. And, for what it's worth, here is one vote for Whedon, or someone of equal brilliance, to do another series. This one was amazingly good.

B005H9B44A|4.0|This was a very good, well written and very entertaining.  It was nice to watch a movie that stuck to a story line and didn't bring in a bunch of unrelated crap.  It was also nice to be able to watch a movie that wasn't full of bad language and sex that had nothing to do with the story.  About time someone realized they can make an entertaining movie without having to resort to sex to draw an audience.  Now for the sequel...

0375842209|2.0|This book did not live up to the hype. The story was full of cliches and stereotypes, and the narration by Death was so overwrought -- an annoying gimmick that was kept up and stretched out throughout the book. And for a book that is against Nazism, it's surprisingly racist, with a use of blackface that's actually praised as an act of courage.

B009T1TUWK|3.0|The subject matter of this episode is very familiar, I've seen it fictionalized before and even read news stories that were similar. Therefore, in order to make its mark, Elementary has to do it one step better than the previous shows. It has not.<br /><br />Past: A boy leaves his home and is abducted off the street. Balloons are left as a thank you for his parents by the kidnapper. Through the years more children are kidnapped. Some are found dead. Others aren't found at all.<br /><br />Today: A seventh child is abducted from her home. Her parents are abrasive, not sympathetic. Her father left her alone in the house to meet a former lover, and lies about it until Holmes confronts him. The woman he met was a witness to the kidnapping, she saw the escape vehicle. (At a later point the parents even suggest trading the first victim back to the kidnapper to secure the release of their daughter. When their demand is not agreed to, they then threaten to hold the captain responsible for all consequences).<br /><br />Watson manages to be more abrasive/intrusive than Holmes himself. The constant sniping and need to have the last word is irritating. Elementary is not improved by this Watson. Unless you appreciate that Holmes finds clues while he is trying to run away from her.<br /><br />The young man who was the first victim many years ago, is discovered driving the kidnapper's van and taken into custody while trying to flee. He refuses to help the police find the kidnapper. He has become attached to the man. This process is carefully explained to us.<br /><br />Holmes shares some of his own \\"history\\" with the rescued youth during an interview. Interesting tidbit if it is true (Holmes is evasive on the point later). He goes through his lightning quick analysis in a few locations. Very clever. He consistently maintains his emotional distance or does he show actual empathy? He discovers the little clues that others miss. His energy is toned down in this episode. Perhaps he finds listening to Watson as tiring as I do. Whatever the cause, he is less the scene stealer here. Still watchable, tho.<br /><br />The police are a touch too oblivious. They dash into the kidnapper's home, right past balloons in an empty room, then state they have nothing. Until Holmes tells them to go back. They find the incredibly obvious balloons and an attached USB drive. Too much Keystone Cops to be credible.<br /><br />Victim #1 is talked into signing an immunity agreement. In an act of atonement he reveals the kidnapper's new residence. The police bust in and rescue the little girl. The kidnapper commits suicide. The child is unharmed. Uhhhh, really?<br /><br />The psychology is interesting, make no mistake. But there are too many detractions to make this an improvement over the previous episodes of Elementary. Holmes finding a loophole in the immunity agreement is too predictable, not fresh at all. His pitting his wits against the clever young murderer who was Victim #1 is sort of bland.<br /><br />Sure they get their guy in the end, outwitting him. It just didn't quite meet its full potential. 2.75 stars rounded up to 3. Mea Culpa, I watched it twice.<br /><br />(If you are going to watch this more than once, as I did, not having to sit through the repetitive commercials is a great motivator to buy the episode at Amazon.)

But like a number of other reviewers here, I'm kind of mystified as to why it's being given such heavy promotion and why so many readers seem so impressed with it. From the reviews and excerpts, I supposed the book to be about hiking and the Pacific Crest Trail. It's not, really. The trail and the hiking are just the setting or backdrop for the author to revisit the most traumatic incidents and episodes of her life -- while continuing to indulge in some of the attitudes and behaviors that seem to have exacerbated some of those earlier situations. The majority of her difficulties and \\"adventures\\" on the trail seem to stem from inadequate preparation, poor judgment, and avoidable mistakes.<br /><br />As part of the publicity surge, Strayed has also been revealed to be the author of the \\"Dear Sugar\\" advice column. Honestly, the idea of people asking this woman for advice is dismaying. Strayed is a competent enough writer, but for me the things she writes about here made for at best, uninteresting, and at worst, very unpleasant reading.
B009FZZFME|5.0|The easiest and cheapest way to watch the best show. Because DISH doesn't have AMC my friends and I could decide how we were going to watch season 3 without waiting and without it costing much money. Best Idea right here

B000OP1M6M|5.0|I have also the 007, and I prefer the black dial, but this watch, the 009, like the 007 keeps good time and it is a classic. The blue dial is a very dark blue. You need to wear it every day, unless you have a winder, and it is +10/-10 sec a day, which is really good for a automatic watch. If you want more accuracy, do yourself and everybody else a favor and get a quartz watch.
B008K6DU4Y|5.0|Its nice to see this in the market for public use. I use to side load this on to my Kindle before.
B0039O8AQK|5.0|Reminds me of what the globalists are trying to do further here in the U.S.,<br />with the help of the puppet president.<br />Allegiance only to the state. I'm sure you've heard the words before: \\"You're either with us or against us.\\"<br />and the propaganda to stir up hatred for foreign govts.

B000P0J0A6|4.0|I thought this movie was creative, full of fresh ideas, and fun! This is a good movie for older children, I wouldn't show the scary, mean parts to small children. This movie is a wild ride and a fun experience!
0316228532|3.0|I  understand that Jo Rowling is an advocate for distressed teens and their families and is actively trying to help.  I know these types of lives and characters exist and the hopelessness of their situations and the inadequacy of any social and community systems to help is discouraging and dire.  I was just disappointed in the down and dirty...we expect magic and uplifted spirits when we read her books.  We care about all of her characters and unfortunately I didn't care about any of them in Casual Vacancy.  I wanted to love this book as I did her Harry Potter series.<br />I think she accomplished more with the Harrys to help our troubled souls to rise above and seek the magic in life then she did with the graphic depression she left me with in the book Casual Vacancy, but I still applaud her spirit for advocating for youth and taking this chance.  I just expected the same caliber of writing and editing.  I still love her...there's absolutely nothing that can change that. She gave us the Harrys.
B000001EG6|5.0|This was Elton Johns second album released in 1970 and his first to be released in the United States becoming an instant hit.<br /><br />This is truly a great album. The lyrics are so passionate and intensely emotional. He and the lyricist Bernie Taupin together produced some of the most memorable songs of all times. This album was before their music became overly commercial.<br /><br />This album has historic value since it stands as Elton's recorded debut on electric piano. It was also the first in a string of 70's albums and hits that would follow.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album as it showcases Elton's less flamboyant side which I found most refreshing. Softer ballads, catchy melodies, more subdued performances and insane piano make this an essential Elton John recording.<br /><br />A great album to add to your collection, classic Elton John.
B004BLDD9Y|2.0|I bought 4 bulbs, two came broken so I used my one return option Amazon provides.  Then another bulb failed within a couple of weeks so then I had to pay for the shipping to return it.  Waiting on refund, but time and money overall is not a good deal.  Partly due to poor service available through Amazon since customer service \\"real person\\" is NOT available to do what was really the right thing to do, which is replace the bulb under the 3 year warranty.  I've contacted the manufacturer, Lighting Ever, to see if they stand behind their warranty.  I'm in the lighting industry and testing LED bulbs before I specify them is very important.  So far this one will not be on the \\"pass\\" list, but I hope to see a positive response from teh manufacture.  Likely they won't do anything since I bought through Amazon.  I also bought two GE bulbs at the same time, had better packaging so they arrived unbroken, and are still working.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Those people saying that this app is a money pit are half wrong. It's true that you can buy additional coins to keep playing but this is a game you pick up for 10 minutes twice a day (progression gameplay). You accumulate those lost coins buy letting your phone sit while you continue on your day. So in reality, you never have to buy coins, EVER. At one point you actually start to gain more coins then you lose because of the prize rewards. I am at level 168 with over 2000 coins by just simply playing the game and not buying coins. So don't go and tell me that this game is a money pit.

0062071017|5.0|Cynthia has a writing style that is very interesting, she presents her main concepts using real world stories with enough details for the reader to get involved and understand the point.  What she addresses is closer to what a strategist like Bruce Henderson would discuss than Michael Porter. She is distilling the essence of being a strategist. Other authors like Michael Porter is closer to Joel Dean ( a microeconomist) , for he is more like a specialized theoretical microeconomics professor that detailed the ideas/concepts related to the behavior of firms in the economic arena.<br />Her book will help inspire professionals, business leaders to sharpen his/her ideas to develop his own strategies for their companies. For leaders trying to find their way out of a complex situation, it will bring a lot of value and clarity of thought.

0316228532|4.0|No, it isn't Harry Potter but then I didn't expect it to be.  This novel was reminiscent of P. D. James without the murders.  Well written with well drawn characters (lots of them too).  I won't say this was her best effort because I loved all the Harry Potter books but it was very good and I only expect her non-magical writing to improve as time goes on.<br /><br />Looking forward to her next one.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|It was more of a chronological history of the author's time in the Navy as a SEAL than the actual mission to take out Osama bin Laden.  Also, there was not much description of the Blackhawk helicopters used on the mission compared to the new reports and photos of the crashed aircraft showing it was clearly a special variant of the aircraft.

0765316994|1.0|I wanted to like this book because I thought the concept of Star Trek from the hapless crewmen's eyes would be \\"fascinating.\\" Unfortunately, Scalzi just couldn't pull it off. The premise was a lame ripoff of a cliche plot device and the second half of the novel just seemed tacked on as Scalzi had to write himself out of the corner the first half put him in. By the time I reached the Codas I was sorry I had even bothered buying this book. Clearly a case of don't judge a book by its cover.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Beware the resellers. Ordered one for my wife this past week. Came in the Lifeproof case with what appeared to be correct serial numbers. However, the seal above the microphone port was broken and the case does not seem to close correctly. A call to Lifeproof ensured that this was a fake case. The seller of mine was casemall05. Friends of mine recommend ordering directly from the manufacturer. I will be doing so immediately after finishing this review.
B004J4WLPU|5.0|Sister: A Novel is an exceptional book, based on the connection of two sisters that lasted throughout life and even after.  It is a book that is hard to put down and ends with a twist you can't predict.  The author builds her story on the ties that bind all sisters, little happenings that only the other would be aware of or even care about.  I recommend this book highly and without reservation.

B008FSCNTK|2.0|I've been a huge Diana Krall fan since I first heard the song \\"You Call it Madness\\" on her 1995 album \\"All For You\\".  I saw her New Year's  Eve concert in 1997 at the Jazz Bakery in Los Angeles. I was even able to get her  autograph on  the CD in the Green Room between shows.  Ah, those were the days!  What could be better than that album or the Live In Paris album?  Well, I have stayed a loyal fan all these years, but this CD really has me disappointed.  I always figure an artist has a right to move in new directions, but this CD has me wondering what direction  that is.  I just could not get excited about any of the songs, really.  I feel nothing when I listen to it.  That's not what I am used to feeling when I listen to songs by an artist of Ms. Krall's caliber.  Better luck next outing.

B008OHV4PG|3.0|i am a long time Neil fan, have about everything he's released & seen him live about 10 times.  (his Hollywood Bowl show with Crazy Horse was great btw.)<br /><br />i rented this from Netflix & i'm glad i didn't buy it.  the 10 songs he does on solo electric guitar were just okay.  i'm not a fan of his \\"Le Noise\\" style which i find cold to listen to.  either i like full on Neil acoustic or the great loud Horse.  i think the electric guitar needs the bass & drum to give it rhythm.  maybe that's why it's called a rhythm session.<br /><br />the interviews were full length but your typical rock star interview.  for me, no revelations.  his book Waging Heavy Peace gives more insights but even there, some ramblings & too much plugging for Pono (i still wonder how that compares with Apple Lossless).<br /><br />his driving around Ontario was ok, but if it weren't Neil Young driving around, most of us has seen small towns.<br /><br />anyway, it's okay to see once but IMO it's not a must see or must buy.<br /><br />Note:  the dvd does not have the special features/interviews that the bluray has.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Great movie and great book! Not just for teens! I watched and read this trilogy, enjoyed it so much that I talked my husband into reading it too and He loved it too!
B006L4MWVE|3.0|I was excited about this movie after watching the preview. However, Battle Royal proved to be unmoving and average despite the potential I thought it had. There are plenty of different characters but most of them are boring and predictable. The special effects are mediocre and the end is unexciting. I'm reminded of Hunger Games (movie version) but without the expensive Hollywood touch. I've heard that the book is better and will be checking that out in the near future.<br /><br />On a positive note, I enjoyed the different weapons and tools that each character received before the battle and the way some of them utilized them to survive. There was enough action to keep me watching and the dark sense of humor of the old teacher (villain) was very entertaining.
B001OMJGD0|4.0|I didn't want to see this movie when it came out because I was still feeling stung by the horrible train wreck that was Superman IV.  But then I discovered the multi-disc boxed set with all four Christopher Reeve movies, director's cuts, a load of extra features, and this movie.  I thought \\"what the heck, I'll see how it goes.\\"  Well, I'm glad I did.  It was a wonderful story, and I thought the sets and special effects were fantastic.  I also loved the warm tones and the art deco that is the Daily Planet.<br /><br />I was familiar with Brandon Routh from his season on \\"Chuck,\\" although I was not a fan until this movie.  I think his real-life love of Superman really comes out in his acting.  I'm ho-hum on Kate Bosworth's Lois Lane (didn't hate it...didn't love it either) and while I love Frank Langella, I think his Perry White is practically invisible.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey, on the other hand, completely steals the show with his portrayal of Lex Luthor.  He's the perfect comic book villain.  First, I love that he isn't afraid to be bald, unlike Gene Hackman back in the day.  Thank heaven for the \\"bald is sexy\\" campaign that's been in place for quite some time.  There are two scenes that really stuck with me.  The comical line \\"Lois Lane?\\" that he sputters while brushing his teeth (it had a certain Scooby-esque quality) and the even more comical physical acting he does a little later where he keeps prompting Lois to say a certain name so he can unleash the hounds at her.  He's so amused at his own cleverness and it's very contagious.<br /><br />*********SPOILER ALERT*********<br />I do agree with others' assessments that Kate Bosworth perhaps wasn't the right person to play Lois Lane.  There really wasn't a lot of chemistry.  On the other hand, given the outcome (the correct outcome, I believe), I recognize there may have been a very good reason for that.  Honestly, despite the new \\"Man of Steel\\" movie coming out soon, THIS movie needs a plan for a long-range sequel...something set 15 years later.

B006LSZECO|3.0|Being an avid mystery reader, I enjoyed the twists and turns of this book.  However, the format, a chapter about her, a chapter about him is really annoying.  It hard to make the story flow smoothly and initially is somewhat confusing in figuring out the timeline.  It's especially hard when you are reading on a kindle and can't skip around easily. Frequently, when this format is presented in a book, I jump and read 5 chapters about the \\"her\\" and then five about the \\"him\\" to really get into the character.  It's more frustrating to keep going back in your mind and remember a detail. Overall, enjoyable story.

B007LNJ4YW|5.0|I bought the CD after hearing Beach House at 1st Avenue in Mpls. Its really terrific. The music is mesmerizing, but not boring (contrary to a few of the other reviews). There are lots of interesting melodies and clever hooks, and the singer is entrancing. I just ordered Teen Dream - hopefully its just as good.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|The book started out with a bang, full of imagery and mystery and completely had me crying in the first few chapters! It was clear that the author did a lot of research and I was captivated by the characters. However, the end was sort of a let down. Not that it ended poorly for just about everyone (not a typical happy ever after story ending) and that's fine, but it felt like an abrupt ending; as if the author had just run out of steam....as if her sponge had just been wrung dry.  It felt like another version of Gone With The Wind and I could almost hear Lavinia saying, \\"After all tomorrow is another day\\"...... for such a powerful beginning, the end was powerless and almost hopeless.....there wasn't even \\"another day\\" for Lavinia to find happiness. All due to the fact that she failed to communicate. Everything that happened to her happened because she didn't ask questions or talk to anyone about her feelings....she didn't even pay attention to her feelings....sad.
B008K6HN8I|2.0|Because of this product I was able to down load dolphine and ultimately to play Flash but no matter what I do Kindle gets stuck every 5 seconds and impossible to watch anything. I cannot believe anyone will sell product like Kindle Fire and OK with it - if they tested this product with or without Kindle Fire before marketing for sure they have found problem like what I am experiencing - Amazon needs to test its product before start selling.<br />At least Amazon was great with refunding $12 for the Kindle case I ordered which did not arrive at all.
0545101417|4.0|I decided to listen to this almost immediately after finishing Hunger Games, as there was enough of a cliffhanger from the first book that I was curious to see what happened next. For the most part, this didn't disappoint.<br /><br />The idea of \\"starvation doesn't have to happen\\" is really hammered into the reader in this book. Where the previous book had forests relatively full of game and stuffed full of various plants, Catching Fire brings us into the Capitol and shows us exactly how wasteful the citizens there are. There's a certain type of horror to listening to one of the Capitol citizens blithely tell Peeta and Katniss to take an emetic and vomit up everything they've eaten so they can enjoy all of the food that a feast has to offer. Especially when you figure that death from starvation is such an everyday occurrence in District 12. It's even worse for how oblivious most of the people in the Capitol are and is a good example of how little they think of any person other than themselves. It also serves as a nice way to somewhat explain how they could overlook the reality of what the Hunger Games really are (government sanctioned murders) and the massive amounts of hunger and mistreatment in the districts surrounding them. Some might find this a little sobering when you can compare this to how many First World countries have citizens that accidentally or purposely ignore the suffering of people in countries and homes around them, which is probably what Collins had in mind when writing this.<br /><br />This really is a \\"middle\\" book in that while things do happen, it's all ultimately just a setup for the events in the final book in the series. We see Katniss's indecision about the men in her life and despite her making an initial choice, she waffles between Gale and Peeta without even realizing it. I have to admit that at times I felt like both guys must be modern day saints to keep from just reaching over and shaking Katniss. She's a cool character, but sometimes I can't help but wonder why Peeta and Gale would put up with her ping ponging between the two of them, even if it isn't done on purpose most times. They're all interesting characters, but sometimes I'd like to see them sort of snap at Katniss or lose their patience with her.<br /><br />The narration for this book is rather well done and McCormick give a great performance as the various characters. I truly love her version of Haymitch, which is probably one of the reasons he's my favorites of the series. The one thing I can say is that at times the book doesn't lend itself to a vocal narrative as well as the first book does. There are a lot of repetitive phrases and while this doesn't ruin the book at all, it does occasionally get slightly irritating.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend this as a read, especially as a library read. There will be people who will want to own this and if you loved the first book, go ahead and buy this one.es I can't help but wonder why Peeta and Gale would put up with her ping ponging between the two of them, even if it isn't done on purpose most times.

B007TBZ63Y|4.0|This next book is wonderful. The ability to learn more about the characters, and see how the characters learn more about themselves, is refreshing. Action packed and definitely a page turner. Can't wait for the next one!
B008220C92|4.0|I couldn't help the title, given the high visibility of the Apple products in this movie. It's far more subtly done than some of the other product placements Hollywood has done and the Macbook does actually work as part of the plot, but I can't help but poke a little fun at this fact.<br /><br />Now I bet you're wondering: is this scary? Yes and no. Yes in that there were scenes where I did react, but no in that none of this is really that scary in the long run. Most viewers won't be clutching their pillows tight later on that night after seeing Sinister. A lot of the scares here are of the \\"jump scare\\" variety, with our supernatural bits leaping out at us from the screen. It's effective with one viewing but it's something that will lose its impact with further watching. What does work here scare-wise is that parts of this are very suitably unsettling, especially as we watch Hawke pretty much come apart at the seams. As the hauntings/supernatural bits continue, Hawke becomes more and more unhinged. As far as gore goes, don't look for it here. There is some gruesomeness via the Super 8 snuff films, but the gorier ones are fairly quickly viewed and it's really fairly light in comparison to the rest of the film. I'll warn you: most of this film does not focus on gore or jump scares. When the film is trying to be scary you have the jump scares. Otherwise the main brunt of this story is more psychological, ultimately being about the slow and possibly inevitable downfall of a guy that puts his work before his family. And I hope you like Ethan Hawke, because he carries the entire movie on his shoulders.<br /><br />Part of why the film worked so well is all due to the soundtrack. The music here is excellently done. It's not the typical orchestra soundtrack you'd get with just about every other movie out there. You have a lot of scenes that are helped out by these pieces of music that are of the discordant variety, complete with \\"spooky children talking\\" effects. This was honestly the one part of the movie that I absolutely and completely loved. If I watch this again, it'll be to enjoy how well the soundtrack is worked into the movie and how slick it makes so much of the movie feel. It's what pushed my opinion of this film up to four stars. It's not the type of music that you could sit and listen to like you would a soundtrack such as say, the Donnie Darko soundtrack, but it's pretty enjoyable for how different it is.<br /><br />I think that ultimately sums up this movie, is that it's different. Sure, the movie is ultimately one that has been told over and over again in various formats, but the creative team on this tried really hard to give it a different spin. For the most part, it works. There's a good story here and enough of the jump scares to keep most viewers entertained. We're also given enough \\"inbetween\\" stuff to lessen the tension, although I do think that the movie could have been tightened a little and had maybe about 10 minutes or so taken off. No more than that, though. And the ending? I rather liked it, but I can't go into why without really spoiling anything.<br /><br />Overall, I can easily see this being one of those films that you'll either really like or you'll really hate. It's going to be something that'll get a cult following and is also one of those \\"artsy\\" horror films that tries to straddle mainstream and indie. I honestly do recommend it at least once. I'm not sure that I'd really watch it again with the same level of attention, but I can say that I enjoyed the ride.nestly the one part of the movie that I absolutely and completely loved. If I watch this again, it'll be to enjoy how well the soundtrack is worked into the movie and how slick it makes so much of the movie feel. It's what pushed my opinion of this film up to four stars. It's not the type of music that you could sit and listen to like you would a soundtrack such as say, the Donnie Darko soundtrack, but it's pretty enjoyable for how different it is.<br /><br />I think that ultimately sums up this movie, is that it's different. Sure, the movie is ultimately one that has been told over and over again in various formats, but the creative team on this tried really hard to give it a different spin. For the most part, it works. There's a good story here and enough of the jump scares to keep most viewers entertained. We're also given enough \\"inbetween\\" stuff to lessen the tension, although I do think that the movie could have been tightened a little and had maybe about 10 minutes or so taken off. No more than that, though. And the ending? I rather liked it, but I can't go into why without really spoiling anything.<br /><br />Overall, I can easily see this being one of those films that you'll either really like or you'll really hate.

0307742539|5.0|I've read all three books...the first was a bit hard to get into, but it didn't take long to grab me...then I just wanted to read more and more.  finished the last book...sad to see it end...hoping there will be another
B007U4DB4G|5.0|Excellent video not only for children but grandparents and everyone.  Funny, cute and worth the cost. First two Chinuanua's video's were funny too. I recommend all three for FAMILY watching.
B008EQIEWS|2.0|The story line was incredibly shallow and did not make me intrigued at all.  This made all the scenes seemed forced and therefore less entertaining.
0679720200|5.0|On the last page of THE STRANGER, Albert Camus shows his hand, as much as tells us we need not infer this or that. Our world is one of \\"benign indifference\\" and, like his mother, our anti-hero Meursault is about to be liberated by death, liberated from all the nonsense, the games, the preening, the self-importance, the institutions, the rules, the rituals, the solipsism, and, most of all, the hypocrisy of what we all agree to call \\"life.\\"<br /><br />Who, it would seem, is the Prosecutor in the trial, to judge anyone? For Meursault, the world consists of these simplicities: sounds, smells, sights, tastes, touched feelings. Throughout the novella, the senses creep in -- some manmade, others those of the world. If this indifferent young man pays heed to anything, that appears to be it. In every other sense, he is the opposite of, say, Holden Caulfield, the boy who cares too much. Meursault cares too little, but from an existential viewpoint, wherein the world is random and the players in it foolish because they fail to realize it -- in fact, like the priest at the end, they insist on impressing some order on it -- this \\"cautionary tale\\" lacks any caution. It is what it is -- a tale. Liberation lies in admitting as much, but, one realizes, it takes almost superhuman strength to admit as much.<br /><br />This gets to the core of existentialism, which, I guess, is not so much a philosophy as an ideal. If you strip away the comforts of family (his mother), church (the priest), society (his friends and girlfriends), you're left with a certain starkness. But what if you fend off terms like anarchy and nihilism and embrace such a \\"crutch-free\\" life as its true meaning, one beyond most men because they dare not admit as much?<br /><br />And yet you don't see many people racing up to embrace such thoughts, do you. Camus's novella reminded me at times of Sartre's short story of a condemned man's last night in prison, \\"The Wall.\\" I have no idea which came first. And I have no idea what the differences are between these two French heavyweights who lived in the same church (gasp!) only a different pew. But I liked Camus's use of story to make his points, how the sun blinded Meursault at the key moments, such that even the reader seems confused and disoriented at the time bullets are fired. How different it is from his heightened senses in a prison cell, waiting for \\"that\\" dawn, the one that ends his existence and promises no variation of an existence afterwards.<br /><br />Where would he have been without the priest to inadvertently save him at the end? Without that scene, he would have been like the rest of us. A pitiful, slobbering, cowardly shell of a man doing all he can not to scream as he is led to the guillotine. But no. Though we don't see the scene, we are given to understand that he will walk to his death with the supreme confidence and nonchalance of the stars he stares at every night. Cold, indifferent, random -- just like the life that will churn on without him after the blade....a what the differences are between these two French heavyweights who lived in the same church (gasp!) only a different pew.

B00992CF6W|1.0|I love minecraft but I bought it and went thru the process then at the end of dowdloading it said an error occurred with my download! this sucks
0307949486|5.0|my thoughts, are the book was alittle hard to get into, but once the ball started rolling, I couldn't put it down.  I thought it was very well written and detailed.  Everyones intitled to their opinions but most everything that happens it this book impacts the next two...thats why they call it a triogy.<br />  Keep in mind this was not my normal kind of read, but since it got such good reviews I decided to try it, not disappointed at all.<br />  I would suggest giving it a try...has a bit of everything in it, intrigue, murder, mystery, romance, sex...
1607066017|5.0|I must admit that part of my reason for buying this book was so I  could lend it to friends so they can also experience the awesomeness that is SAGA.  I love to share my comic book trades with my fellow  nerds.  Brian K. Vaughan is one of my favorite comic book writers.  I've followed him ever since discovering Y The Last Man.  It's been awhile since he's put out a new book- but man, was it worth the wait!  I bought the single issues of Saga since it started back in March 2012.  And even though I've read every issue (and LOVED them), I decided to plunk down another $10 for this collected trade.  His work always contains the best lines of dialogue, and his imagination never ceases to entertain me in new and surprising ways every time.<br /><br />And now let's talk about the incredible artistry of Fiona Staples.  WOW!!!!! Her pictures bring Brian's words to life. I couldn't imagine another artist doing what she does with this book.  And hopefully, if it goes according to their plans- we will never have to.  Her art breathes humanity, humor and horror in all the right ways.  I hope to someday be even half the artist she is.<br /><br />So what are you waiting for?  It's ten bucks!  It was definitely the best ten bucks I've ever spent.  I can't wait until issue #7 comes out next month! (November 14th to be exact. Yes, I am seriously counting down the days til it's release.  It's the ONLY monthly comic book that I buy. That I want to buy. Because I can't wait 7 bloody months for a trade to come out. Plus the letter column is a hoot!)<br /><br />Okay, I'll stop gushing now.  Enjoy Saga! :)
B000T433CO|1.0|My cousin Damian is married to Alex; her father is the man responsible for the Christmas lights in this movie. They are AWESOME! From the delicate little buds around the fireplace to the stunningly lit garlands that cover the staircase, they are so pretty and perfect. And the strategically placed candles add such warmth and charm. The Christmas tree is beyond beautiful. The outside of the house is a treat; gorgeous arrays of colour that perfectly suits an English cottage. They truly showcase what a British Christmas should be like. Oh yes the movie itself - BEYOND PUTRID and possibly the WORST MOVIE EVER MADE.EVER.
B009QWNQTA|5.0|Great episode. Snow shows Emma where it all began for her. An evil queen emerges again in story book land.  Sir Lancelot makes an appearance and Charming and Henry continue to look for lost ones.
B0056AFBB2|4.0|This is a high quality well made micro atx case.  It has cable management for a clean build.  There are rubber grommets on all the cable holes.  There are holes with grommets for piping your water cooling to the outside, but it is possible to install large radiators internally.  Check out the tom's hardware build for what this case can do.  Everything fits right, goes in the right place, and install cleanly.  This is a solid piece of work.<br /><br />Because of the high quality there are some glaring mistakes. The first mistake has to do with the side vent.  All the large opening in this case have filters on them. There's a cleanable filter on the bottom to filter the air coming into the power supply and for a bottom fan if you install one.  There are filters on top of the case.  There are filters on the front of the case. However, there is NO filter on the side of the case.  Instead it's a big hole right next to your motherboard that will let plenty of dust get in.  In addition, this hole has a bulge on the outside.  Installing a screen on it is difficult.<br /><br />The other mistake is the thumb screws to open the case.  I have to guess which thumb screw goes into which hole because neither the holes nor the screws are machined with any sort of precision. Eventually I got this case closed and all the screws to work correctly.<br /><br />My computer runs cool, takes up little space, I love the top usb 2.0 and 3.0 ports.  I also love the understated styling.  If Fractal Design makes a window for the side panel on this case, makes some better screws for opening the case(or ditches screws all together), this would be perfect.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I fell victim to the excitement and authenticity of this book to the extent that it hurt to put it down in order to grab a bite.<br /><br />So many stories involving the military seem contrived and artificial but not NO EASY DAY.  You have to catch your breath as one vivid image is built and follows another.  And beside purely enjoying the depiction of each mission that Mark and his fellow SEALS were involved in, including the climactic one to get Osama Bin Laden, one is constantly in awe of the bravery, skill and patriotism that this elite group showed in tour after tour without hardly a break.<br /><br />I cannot rate this book high enough.
B007XGJK4G|5.0|I viewed this documentary with the most basic information about Bob Marley and now I am a fan. His story, his views, his legacy has more depth than I could have imagined. It was fantasic to hear from those closest to him in such a open and honest fashion.

B0031RSBS2|1.0|I often read reviews and wonder if I should take notice or not. Often I have enjoyed a book that has had a not so great review. I am working my way through the Reacher series and enjoying them a lot. I saw that this had some bad reviews, but decided to read it anyway. In hind sight, I have to admit that the reviews were right and this is definitely the weakest of the books so far.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|The price is good for the length of the game and I did not have a single glitch on my kindle while playing.
B007AJFSJW|4.0|Even if you don't agree with Krugman's ideas the book is worth a read purely to see the \\"other side\\" of the current options that are on the table for dealing with the economy.  It's well written and is almost completely lacking in modern economic technical jargon.  He makes his case for why the governments of the world should be spending more on this crisis NOT less.  He provides compelling evidence to back his thesis from purely theoretical to real world examples.<br /><br />Time will tell if his ideas are correct...
B003A4IFGY|4.0|Listenable and likeable. Very cool album from an awesome band!! The master at his best. Mojo kicks it!!Keep on rockin boys!!!?

B000UBMSB8|5.0|Always loved this movie, but when my VHS broke I replaced it with this wonderful 4-disk DVD set with tons of versions AND extras!!! Soooo worth buying!!
B004TTHLBE|5.0|The subject material here is not something I would normally consider reading, I only read it based on some of the negative reviews stating how outlandish it was.  What intrigued me the most about the story was how the author brought together, man, old gods, and new gods...material things that are worshiped today...and painted a very interesting landscape that will haunt me for quite some time to come.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Story was okay but not what it was hyped up to be. Ending was disappointing. Should have stopped at 82%.
1582701709|5.0|The book is all i expected and i have passed it on to many friends who are equally pleasedExcellent birthday gifts and I can't wait to purchase the newer ones I think the power and the magic. I've viewed on line. Thanks and good reading<br />Paula Young
1451696191|5.0|Ordered \\"Perks of Being A Wallflower\\" and it shipped right away! Literally got it Saturday morning even though I was supposed to get it Monday night. This was awesome [: Now I get to enjoy my purchase quicker and easier! Thanks (: super pleased.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Fiio E6 headphone amp = pure awesome. I haven't been able to listen to ear bleedingly loud music since I moved into my apartment. But this little guy has fixed that for me. Now I can turn my $20 headphones into skull rattling sonic emitters. My life is once again complete.
B000RZIGVS|3.0|some of the discs seem not to work as they should.<br />I found that the picture in some of the discs keeps on bouncing and showing squares.<br />at a closer look at the disk it seems there are marks that show the manufacture procedures was not preformed properly.<br />I would suggest Amazon looks into this before continuing selling this product.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I really wanted to like this book as I am a big Harry Potter fan, but I just couldn't. The  characters, especially the adults, were awful people. Very few had any redeeming qualities, and many of the story lines were left unresolved and left all of the children in the same unhappy households they were in throughout the book. There were a few too many characters to follow, and the main plot was just boring. Not a good outing for Miss Rowling.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A compelling account of the events before, during and after the killing of OBL. How they feel about what they do and the high standards they follow.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|the graphics are impressive and as someone who enjoys bejeweled, it was fun...but got complicated/difficult quickly and to go thru the story again and again just to stay on levels I can handle...well, it got annoying real fast for me. Keep in mind, I'm 60ish and just wanna have fun w/the games/apps...don't want to have to figure out how to get to the next/higher level. If you're adept at apps that have increasingly difficult levels (without instructions)you'll enjoy this.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really like this app. I like the ability to scroll through the cities I choose.  Data is accurate too.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like that you can play the rooms that are available in the free app.  as with most apps of this type you are asked to have 'friends' to use certain rooms and quests but you can play the open ones a few times.  energy runs out a bit too fast or I would have given it a 5.
B0000062FL|5.0|As a fourteen year old, I can remember visiting a friend's place where his older brother had a fresh, minted vinyl copy of this album. it was his chick magnet and drawers dropper. In our sniffy progressive rock know better than to listen to easy listening, this did not cut the mustard. No sir! Well actually, the cover was given a work over and the stereo headphones (a novelty when all we had was tin cans) also owned by the Big brother, did give remarkable shifting textures from spotty ear to acneed ear. So it was four or five years before the magic of this album came into my airwaves as a monster of its time. By then Mr Santana was dressing in white and playing with John McLaughlin and was fully fledged in his guitar hero mould. So this album, most of the first Santana album and a few individual tracks are all that remains of a unique sound. Watch the boys play Woodstock to get a sense of how they clicked as a whole. Abraxas is a trail blazer. Hurumph and an arty piece of cover work is that not so?
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I love this book and would definitely recommend it! It is a sad story but it is totally worth reading.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This fascinating story took on a life of it's own, and from the moment I started reading it, I became a part of Harold's journey. Harold is recently retired and lives a dull and ordinary, although separate and seemingly miserable life, with his wife Maureen. Though happily married at one time, they seem to just co-exist in a house with no love, ever since their son no longer lives there. Upon receipt of a letter from an old aquaintance who is dying, to whom he feels an enormous debt (though we don't know why for a long time), he makes a spontaneous decision to walk the 600 miles to personally deliver a letter expressing his sadness, rather than mailing it. It is a long journey, for which he is totally unprepared. He has no real plan, he is just driven by a purpose, and knows that as long as keeps walking, his friend will stay alive until he gets there. Along the way, he sheds things that have no real meaning and truly focuses on only that which is important to him in his quest. He meets many interesting characters along the way, and when their lives intersect, even if only briefly, there are lasting impressions. Gradually things are revealed about what has happened in the past, and both Harold, while on his walk, and Maureen, while at home, go through parallel, soul-searching revelations, and yet they still cannot truly communicate with each other. Life changing tranformations take place during this remarkable journey, and at the end, they each arrive at a point of true understanding, which makes for enjoyable reading, as well as real life understanding. Life is not just about the destination, it's really all about the journey and the companions we choose along the way.
B000UJ48WC|5.0|I'm an european, et nous n'avons pas la chance d'avoir la version longue, so it was a great pleasure to see it, for the first time at home, with these 25 minutes bonus.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Just great.  Good for time killing and still a challenge.<br /> Not for kids sure to mild nudity. But the nudity is tasteful
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love this series!!! New addiction! Perfect mix of love, naughty, an curiosity. I seriously can not get enough of these books.
B00005A0V0|4.0|This remains a funny wee album. Naff lyrics (think Tolkein on acid written on a blotter at Eton) but they kind of work because the music is such good quality pop. What I mean is I can have it on in the background and there is enough going on to make it interesting. Good musicians and an eclectic mix of styles make it a bit of a bubbling brook. It ends with some very dark, rock like boogie (last part of \\"Nine Feet Underground\\"). Can't say anything else of Caravan did the business for me, but this warm bath of an album can stay in the collection and occupy its niche with some pride. If you are a fan of late sixties-early seventies pop that is not bubblegum (although \\"Golf Girl\\" gets close), then give this a listen.
B004A8EI9M|5.0|it is the best tv show with great graphic. who like zombies watch its my favorite tv show. i love the walking dead
B0090EHVMC|5.0|This is my 3 year old son's new favorite movie, and for once it is something I don't mind watching with him! The bright colors and music are fun and even catch the attention of our baby, who will try and hang upside-down off my lap to watch! The story line has some great lessons about respecting nature and how greed can ruin things. We rented this at Redbox first but after the third time my son begged to rent it again I figured I ought to just buy it!<br /><br />Also, I usually can't tell a difference in blu ray vs DVD- but this one I can. It's vibrant and amazing.
B0091REZMW|5.0|neeto groovy<br />awesome. really addicting game full of hard puzzles and mind challenges. got to have this one for your collection.
B007RTAR64|5.0|This was purchased as a collectible.  The clothes and accessories as well as the doll portrait the character very realistically.  She is immediately recognized as Katniss by anyone who as ever seen the film.  The realism of the character and her accessories also make her a fun toy.  We would love to find Peeta in the same quality.  Also the price was very reasonable.  We have looked at other movie characters and found them to be very expensive... too much especially if you are considering a toy.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest and I love that it is now on my Kindle! I don't know what else to say about it

B007G92QGO|4.0|A page turner. Keeps you guessing right to the end. Makes one wonder, 'How as a parent would I have coped'.
B000MD7OKY|4.0|I love the old classics!  It is very well acted--No bad language or anything.<br />It is fun to watch the \\"oldies\\" with all the great stars of yesteryear.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I've been using Evernote for almost two years now, and I have yet to encounter any of the problems that others are. I'm willing to bet that half of these are User errors.

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|love this game really helps to pass the time and i like that u get unlimited shuffles. great graphics too!
B008X77K8W|4.0|First of all I am a huge Chris Knight fan. I first started listening to his music about 1994. \\"Little Victories\\" is a good record. It's not his best. I would recommend it to anyone, but I was a little disappointed. I will buy his next record as soon as it is available. I think the songs were a little stonger on the prior 2  records. I'm a big fan of the \\"Trailer Tapes\\". Chris Knight is still one of the best singer/songwriters in the business today.
B009QW6ZT8|5.0|New episode was awesome can't wait to see what the next one will bring. Highly recommend this tv show if you like suspense.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was a great book and very easy to read.  Just as good as the other Sylvia Day books.  Better written than 50 shades.
B00001QGRE|5.0|How can you not love the blackout tape. Definitely an awesome buy, exactly what I wanted and expected. Shipped fast and on time. Boom.
B009329ZF2|4.0|This falls into the good old action movie category.  The script won't win any prices, but I enjoyed some of the humor and for most of the time, the story kept moving along at a pretty good pace. I was also surpised that Rihanna did a pretty good job unlike that Huntington woman in Transformers. Don't overthink it, just sit back and enjoy the ride.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book!  Loved the way it was written. Full of surprises. Highly recommend to those who enjoy an unexpected thriller.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Fun app. Lots of different layouts. Could use more tiles. Main prob is its a battery hog. Worth the price
B0072OFOM6|5.0|Originally came messed up in the packaging but sent it back and had a quick replacement shipped back in a timely manner. Great service and the product looks great and works fine! I am a huge fan of the Spartacus series so the blu-ray was a must. Plus you can't beat all of the extra features that come with the blu-ray version.
0525952926|5.0|I received Fall Of Giants on its publication date last year, and set it aside.  I read it just before the arrival of WOTW.  The continuity was a great help for me.  I think that the diversity of the worldwide characters and the character development is outstanding.  The author had me feeling their joys, their sorrows, and especially their anger.  The author killed loved ones with a sentence or two, he showed bone crushing, life altering events in short paragraphs, and emotionally devastating incidents come quickly, but that is how life actually is, and was during these nightmare years.  I was left with a greater appreciation for the indomitable nature of the human spirit.  Good does not always win over evil, but often, good can outlast it.  People can decide to put the past behind them and with a, \\"Today is the first day of my life\\" attitude move on and find joy.  I can't wait for the concluding volume.
B008OOYALE|2.0|I have Bakery Story and know it takes time to develop your 'bakery'.  BUT unless you spend money on this game, all you do is wait.  You wait a day to get coins (from your habitats) or grow food (from farms).  Since everything is costly, you do one thing and you are out of food and coins...just seconds.  Then you wait another day.  Oh, you have to buy farms &amp;habitats so it can take awhile to get a decent size one.  Collecting gold is even worse.  One coin per day from 'neighbors' but most things require thousands of coins.  Watch paint dry, its faster and gives you greater feeling of accomplishment.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Couldn't put this book down, it was absolutely amazing!! It was a quick read..I cant wait to read more books by her!
B000FC1MCS|5.0|A great story for anyone who has a need to understand a child with autism.  I enjoyed the creativity greatly?  This book pegged my grandson to a tee.
B008PCVGKI|5.0|Ben Goldacre walks us through the incredibly perverse world of pharmaceuticals, regulation, trials and delivery of products to the wider populace. Every person, especially those involved with regulation and control of new drugs, should read this as an eye-opening guide to various misdeeds and systemic inefficiencies. A wise, very carefully thought out thesis on what is wrong with the system and what needs to change, for the benefit of our own lives. Fascinating, horrifying and gripping.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I appreciate the insight into a secert world.  The sacrifices that these guys make every day is humbling and under appreciated.  The description of the decision makers is additional proof that we are often poorly led by opportunistic jerks trying to appear competent.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Good book, I was interested the whole time and wanted to know what was going to happen next. Very graphic and detailed.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The movie is fantastic. Action packed, funny for all ages. The digital copy was easy to download and with the four options to view from you can watch it practically wherever you go. I Highly recommend it
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I just bought a Samsung 4.0 player and downloaded this app. it works very nicely. However, I am wondering how to create playlists using genre or just picking songs by genre. some instructions would be helpful. it took me awhile to figure out how to scramble the songs. i am still not sure if i got it but i did it once. otherwise it is great
B009CPES4I|3.0|After hearing about this movie on NPR I was rather keen to watch it.<br />While it does show a few British retirees out in India, it is not quite the comedy it was portrayed to be.<br />Seeming terse or scripted in parts, this movie could have used so many cultural clashes for mirth.<br />It is not bad overall though, with a good ending and many poignant moments thrown in.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|This was about the 5th or 6th Reacher book I've read and probably the least interesting.  But it may just be that there is so much the same about all of the Reacher books that I am bored with things I used to find more compelling.
B005D9MUWY|1.0|Does not work on Samsung s3. Crashes everytime. Trial version works though. They really need to look into this issue since so many uses s3 unless their goal is to force those who got this free on Amazon to pay for it on play store then its one crappy low move.
0451232577|5.0|I will read anything by Follett! I knew it would draw me in from the first page. He didnt disappoint. I cant wait to read the next two books of this trilogy.
B00914JWSW|5.0|Well worth the commercical hard disk for the inside pamphlet documenting each song's history.<br /><br />No further words other than what a beautiful memorial CD to Marvin Hamlisch.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Really great read couldn't put it down :) and i loved Hanna and clay  and how there stories messed together
B004VSSA6S|5.0|Tough Love: Best Of The Ballads .................... AREOSMITH..Is one of the best ROCK bands ever to grace the air waves. One reason they are one of the best is because they don't limit there music or their fans. No one with an onuce of TASTE could complain about this ALBUM.. Why would any band want to stick to just one sound, format, style that's why GREAT bands like AEROSMITH has been around for over 30+ years. You can always count on all the GREAT bands with this kind of staying power and talent to always rediscover themselfs, either by going their own ways and coming back together and arresting the demons that came along to always rise above it all, one thing for sure they never disapoint the TRUE FANS........[[ASIN:B004VSSA6S Tough Love: Best Of The Ballads]]
B007SGM084|5.0|I am so happy I let my friends convince me to buy these books. They are so addictive. The author's use of English is amazing, which makes the books even more heart capturing.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|angry birds what are u thinking letting pigs take over ( like I care)  but this is awesome I like building things I'm may be blonde but who cares this is soooooooo much fun love it I think y'all will to.......... HEY IF YOU STILL PLAY TEMPLE RUN OR ANYTHING ELSE WITH THE AMAZON GA.E CIRCLE FIND ME IM RUDOLPHTHEBLONDE
B007FEFLTO|4.0|As sequels go it was good, but not as exciting as \\"The Fall of the Giants\\" but still has the Follet fingerprint, historical basis with several families intertwined in the events shaping the world.  It did not appear to do as much character development and historical explanation as the first book.  It was still enjoyable to read and worth buying!
B0053O89RY|5.0|Modern Family is a great sitcom that is well written, with great actors each having their own distinct role, and addresses the many changes and diversity within our today's society.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|This movie not only captures the original story, but puts a wonderful twist on it for today's audience.  The animation is superb, the music is great and it's an overall entertaining movie.  I purchased the DVD/Blue ray of this because it was a must for my movie collection!
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Fantastic read. Enjoyed every minute now waiting for book 3 just the book your looking for after 50 shades of grey trilogy wow
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I liked this book a lot  because   it had a lot of action.  I think that the next book is as good
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This alarm clock app is great. I can set up multiple reminders to myself. I can also set the reminder (alarm) to repeat on certain days of the week. It also allows using my own music stored on the device as the alarm. Overall a very useful tool to help me stay organized.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|i like the game because if you play smart you can go for 20 to 30 min on a few coins.
B0091REZMW|3.0|the game is ok and not that challenging ,  but i guess it is like that because I just started it.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I like reading about a good Dom. This could never happen in the real world of the BDSM life. At least none that I have ever heard of in the lifestyle.<br /><br />Mss Vicki
B007IXWL2C|5.0|After the first two, and many twist & turns later, every one gets the fabled happily ever after. a good read
B008XBCJ34|2.0|My version arrived quickly. I was excited to pop it in and finally have access to seeing the film in 3D at home (as we should have had ages ago). The fox fanfare plays in perfect 3D. The 3D in the opening shot seems muted, but let's keep watching. Jake's opening eyeball shot is next. Fine. Then we cut to the profile of Jake's eye...<br /><br />Someone has made a terrible mistake...<br /><br />The following shots, Jake shuffling in his tube and then looking up to see the droplet of water floating in front of him, and even the long interior of the space station are all wonderfully deep and dimensional.<br /><br />Rewinding back to that profile eyeball shot, I begin to realize that the Left and Right eyes are backwards in this shot. (his far cheek seems close, his close cheek seems far away, almost as if his head is the interior of a bowl) If i switch my television's 3D setting to 'inverted', the shot is corrected. But only the one shot.<br /><br />I have not progressed much further than a few dozen scenes to check if there are any other inverted mistakes. Nothing so far. But i've only viewed a few short minutes of the film. I'll be returning it and calling Fox to see if they're aware of the problem. I just cannot believe I've waited this long for the Panasonic exclusivity to finally be released, only to find out that it's got a glaring error in the first few seconds.<br /><br />Buys be wary that you may be picking up an uncorrected version here (who knows if it will ever be adressed).
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great price, great movie. Discs are stacked right on top of each other, go find yourself a case for it. That is it.
B0000258CK|5.0|It's like hearing an old friend.I'd forgotten her songs were so great & fun.Maria McKee covered one of Carole King's songs, I'd ever heard, but it's awesome, something like, I can't make it alone, on one of her solo albums. I really wish Sheryl Crow remake this cd. Those songs are so great, plus Jazzman, it would be perfect.  I was thinking the other day why someone didn't remake that album and how perfect Sheryl Crow would be.  I think she'd do it well! I remember this  being huge when I was in 3red grade or so.  Listening to it as an adult, it's great!.  Thanks. MEG20
B007D2XSW0|5.0|i recieved the app free when they had it free when they had the app free for a day.! i wouldnt say its worth the price but it is nice
030758836X|2.0|If you're after a well written compelling book look elsewhere. This seems designed to appeal to the type of reader who chooses exclusively from the \\"mystery shelf\\" or buys their books at the grocery store. The characters are flat and unrealistic the driving force here is all the twists and turns in the story rather than any depth or character development. The author was a former writer for such heavyweight publications as Entertainment Weekly. Her pedigree shows here. The Amy chapters are so obnoxious as to be almost unreadable. You're likely to find greater literary merit on your teenager's facebook page. I don't fault the book for being what it is. This sort of lightweight plot driven stuff is exactly what people are talking about when they use the term \\"beach read\\" I'm just not quite sure why the book is getting the attention it is getting.
B008G8SFGO|3.0|I listened to clips of these songs on Amazon.  I didn't really care for it.  I actually bought this on vinyl--for I recently bought a new turntable.  I still don't like it.  Side one is okay, but side two is filler.  The only good song on side 2 is Tommy Thayer's song \\"Out of this World\\".  Paul's vocals are not that great, nor are the lyrics he writes.  As with Sonic Boom, this is another KISS album where I actually prefer the Gene songs over Paul's (And I am a HUGE Paul Stanley fan, but his work with KISS on the last two albums have left me disappointed).  Gene shines on \\"Wall of Sound\\" and Think it is the best song on the album--It has an 80's KISS feel and think it could have easily been a track off of Animalize.  Tommy's solo on \\"Out of this World\\" is astonishing, yet unlike Sonic Boom, where it sounded like he just pieced together Frehley solos, His solos on Monster Primarily have an 80's twist reminiscent of Bruce Kulick.<br /><br />I think KISS should retire or reboot itself by taking the MakeUp off, getting Bruce Kulick in the band and doing a tour to promote the Carnival of Souls LP with a new setlist heavy with 80's hits.  Other than that, KISS is truly more of a brand than a band.  KISS should have really quit when they were ahead when they did the 2000 \\"farewell\\" tour.  I rather would have seen them actually retire in 2000 than drag the band thru the mud and being nothing but a live commercial to pimp their 3000 KISS items.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed the third book even more than the first.  The writing keeping me up late to read. It was hard to put down as I read each chapter.  I have never been a book reader and these are my first real books.  I definitely recommend all three books.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Bought the movie for my wife, who wanted it. She said she was very happy with it, and that I should watch it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|easy to set up and use, even for a novice like me. i've had no problems with it. i love the extended outlook. it is more accurate than the local tv stations.
B000ICXQF6|5.0|Terry Gilliam at his best.  I love the stylishness of surreal films, it's just they tend to have negative subject matter a lot so I'll try to just watch one here and there.  This one is Amazing, I love the loop and the craziness of the film - you can really feel it.<br /><br />Gilliam is also really good at period scenes - I loved the feel of his ancient Greece warrior battle in Time Bandits and this movie has a brief World War I scene that I thought was cool, too.<br /><br />Great if you love surreal films and probably good for a change of pace if you've mainly been watching mainstream films recently.
B0098VYCCE|1.0|Absolutely horrible cheap storyline. bad acting and bad casting. there was absolutely nothing worth watching of this movie.<br />They took elements of Lord of the Rings, Mononoke etc. But nothing original and what they stole was the poorest remake ever.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|easy peasy simple to use and very convenient.  so nice while shopping on line or at the store.  nice basic.
B009EAO38C|5.0|Found them on Youtube and immediately became a fan. Not only is the music excellent but if you go to watch the videos you can see how into it they are. Something powerful about seeing performers devote so much of themselves to their craft.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|pretty fun take on match three style games.  already spent a few hours and it just gets better.  worth the five bucks.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|App is very addicting.  Starts out slow, until you get a few stars from prizes, then it gets a bit hectic, with prizes and coins falling left and right.  Very fun.
B00006JU7T|5.0|There's a point where a movie passes from being mere entertainment into a real-life situation that reflects a critical situation in our culture. \\"Serpico\\" is such a movie. I've always enjoyed Al Pacino's acting abilities in whaever movie he's been in that I've seen. & in this film he he did an awesome job or portraying Serpico. Viewing this film is a sobering experience especially because of the fact that police corruption is real problem not only in NYC but throughout the US - on the west coast as well as the east. It takes a man of incredible courage to determine to remain honest in the face of the terrible temptations to do otherwise.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Outstanding graphics and fun game.  I Love it,  keep wanting to play.  Nice twist of puzzle game,  makes it more interesting and challenging
B005Q1W10A|4.0|I am very disappointed in the quality of the DVD for both the Season 1 and Season II. There were halts and stops in both sets.  Did I purchase a \\"used\\" sets?
B009QW7HMC|5.0|This episode is free to watch on AMCTV.com just sayin. This season is going to be awesome. Can't wait for the next episode.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a fantstic game for kids and adults. The graphics ate vibrant and beautiful.  It has a great storyline to follow along.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This is a really great period drama! I would definitely recommend it. Great cast and fantastic plot. Make sure to buy the Original UK Edition.
0786178140|5.0|Another CD of a Barbara W. Tuchman history.  I love her style.  This was even better than \\"A Proud Tower.\\" I have really enjoyed listening to this narrative of the century of the Black Death and Hundred Years War.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it's great. I love it. and people, stop complaining about it not having all the blocks that Pc has. remember you are paying $20 less. but I can't wait for an update. they don't have armour yet and no food bar and I have been trying to make obsidian but they don't have buckets! but still is a very good game.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great, fast, easy read.  I thoroughly enjoyed learning of the first-hand account of the UBL raid.  I liked the fresh and honest position of this hero on this mission being used for political gain.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|The movie has shaped the cultural memory of the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" for the past few generations of people raised on television. While a classic in itself, there is much to be said for the original book on which the movie is vaguely based. The book gives the characters of the scarecrow, tin man and lion enough room to develop.  There are wonderful adventures in the book that are absent in the movie. Many of the characters have great back stories in the book that are missing in the movie. Having been raised on the movie, I am glad that I've finally encountered the real thing!<br /><br />I got this with the audio book whispersync deal. It works fairly well. I was impressed.<br /><br />Ann Hathaway does a fine job with the narration. Her voice is famous enough that it gets in the way at firstbut quickly it moves into the background and the characters emerge.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This book was a little addicting... I could not put it down; when I did, I dreamt of the characters. Although it was hard to put down, I still found parts of the book to be a bit predictable. Even so, the book in its entirety was funny, sometimes surprising, and an overall great read.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Lots of fun!  I've played the desktop version and I think I like this one more.  The graphics are excellent and the music really adds to the ambiance.  Very relaxing._
B008GVD6D8|5.0|The second novel in the Crossfire Trilogy just Blew my mind. I loved it!! And bummed that I have to wait two months for the 3rd book in this series. Although the first novel \\"Bared to You\\" had a fifty shades feel to it, the 2nd novel \\"Reflected in You\\" was anything but!! I couldn't put it down and read it in one night. The tortured love Gideon has for Eva is breathtaking and riveting, two tortured souls trying to make their relationship work. I have already recommended this book to all my friends.
0451232577|5.0|Fall of Giants is one of those books that once you start it, you can't put it down!  It holds your interest from the<br />beginning, June 1911, to the end, January 1924.  The lives of five very different families from different countries and positions in life are woven together with the history of an era that changed the world.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|It took me a while to wrap my head around the supernatural but then I got it!! It was a well written book with a powerful message.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I love this game.  It plays very well and offers some excellent twists to the classic match three game.  And while there's no real history to the history, at least the feel of each section is quite authentic.
B0006HBZXS|5.0|I love this movie!! With a name like The Edge I thought it would be cheesy, the only reason I even watched it was because of Alec Baldwin. Much to my surprise it was brilliantly written, and the dialogue is the kind of special writing where you have to pay attention, and suddenly it's two hours later and the movies over and you absolutely love it. As far as the seller goes, it shipped fast and was here on the estimated date, no complaints here. 10/10
B006O6F932|4.0|It seems to me that this year, for your little girl (age range approx 7-10) there is no better gift this coming Holiday season, than one from the Monster High collection!  The dolls are leaving the stores quickly, and we're all running around searching for just the right one (or two or three!) for our little monsters!  Luckily there are several \\"versions\\" of each doll so it's not hard to find one they don't already have.<br /><br />This playset is wonderful!  My own daughter went BONKERS when she saw it.  From a kids perspective it's just the best thing ever!  From a parental standpoint, maybe not.  It certainly requires a bit of assembly...not too bad, but is it sturdy enough to last through hours and hours of play...that remains to be seen.  I'm thinking it's no less sturdy than any other playsets your kids may have (Littlest Pet Shop, as an example).  Some parents shun toys that require any sort of assembly, even putting stickers on things...so if that's you, then perhaps I'd avoid this.  For the most part though, I'm sure even without your help, your little girl could handle it just fine!  They are smarter with these things than we give them credit for!<br /><br />As I said, this is a hot toy item this Holiday...get them while they're hot!  Monster High is where it's at!
B00007KGCW|1.0|I didn't know there were different series  I got a DVD that was released in another country and it won't play
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Sadly I can watch this movie over and over again. The Dark Knight guy didn't like it ...but I did, I guess that is the only opinion that matters. Your own.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|At first \\"blush\\" I couldn't put it down.  But then as I got deeper in the book, believe it or not, it got a little boring and monotonous.  I get it - sexy, steamy, and oh so reminiscent of early stages in relationships, but also so predictable, kinda like the midpoint in a new lust based relationship.  Been there, done that.  What I did like about the book though was the fact that it broke a barrier, sort of, for today's  females, that yes, we like a good steamy read, and yes, we appreciate being marketed to and recognized as sexual beings without apology.  It made for great girlfriend conversations.  That was what I liked best about the book.  Eroticism minus the guilt.  Overall, I give it a solid 3 stars.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Only negative thing is that you either need an Xbox 360 Audio Adapter or you could take off the black cover over the component wire going into the Xbox* so that the HDMI will also fit. Once the HDMI fits you can Mute your tv and hear both game volume and chat through the Headset. If you set it up with only HDMI and the piggyback splitters**, you will have game volume through the tv and the headset. Muting the tv will shut off game volume for both. If you are only planning on using this headset for PlayStation3, you will not need an adapter or modifications to any cables.<br /><br />*It is advised that after taking off the cover, re-cover the plug using electrical tape.<br />** Piggyback splitters are included with the headset.
0345803485|3.0|OK, this is the first review I have every posted on Amazon, but after finishing this book I just have a need to vent. I didn't go into reading this book thinking that it was going to be a profound piece of literature, it is literary junk food pure and simple. That being said, junk food is definitely enjoyable every now and then, and many parts of this book provided some sexy escapism. My main problem is worth the Ana character...she is sooooo damn annoying. Why does it seem that so many female characters these days have to be either whiny, pouty crybabies, or complete bit**es? Is this feminism? All I know is that when Ana meets Christian, he almost immediately tells her about his particular sexual appetites. So does this virgin turn tail and run? No. Does she throw caution to the wind and enjoy the ride? No. She prefers to indulge herself thoroughly, both with the sex and the fringe benefits of a billionaire doting on your every whim, and then complain about it, CONSTANTLY! (Its so great to have a woman griping after she has just had her 6th orgasm in a row :p) Not to mention that she does the stereotypical woman thing: oh since I don't like this man the way he is I'll just change him. And frankly her incessant whining, complaining, and bugging him about EVERYTHING he does, is far more painful to endure than any of the mild BDSM he does. It seems like every 5 pages I wanted to yell \\"Either get over yourself or hit the road!\\"<br /><br />So while this book is sexy, it would've been a million times more enjoyable if both characters were at least on the same page sexually. Having Ana there was like having my parents there....talk about a mood killer!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I saw the author interviewed on morning TV and was so impressed with him that I decided to try his first Reacher novel.  I have been away from the mystery genre for awhile but have returned to it this year, enjoying Defending Jacob and Girl Gone.  I am now a fan of the character, Jack Reacher, and the style of his creator, Lee Child.  I plan to work my way through the rest of the series.
034580404X|1.0|I personally don't understand all the hype about this trilogy. It was very repetitive in content and dialogue. The only reason I read the three books was because I didn't have anything else to read at the time, though I admit I skipped over alot of pages. Boring, boring, and more boring.<br />hebs
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|best game I ever played!! I can't wait for the second one!!! It keeps you on the edge of your seat and is a little creaky sometimes
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|i got this free app and was not disappointed. it does exactly what its supposed to do. its very basic but thats all i was looking for.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I purchased this with the Asus motherboard and messed around with the fan controller of the BIOS. Needless to say, the i5-3570K is made for overclocking, which is what the K stands for. So if you're getting this, throw out the stock fan and replace it with a heatsink. Any heatsink fan is better than the stock fan, in fact, with experimentation, I found out that what keeps the CPU in cooler temps with stock ingredients is the heatsink itself. The fan alone uses more power than my two 200 mm fans. I actually, plugged those two huge fans into the CPU and CPU OPT Fans and the CPU fan to CHASSIS FAN 3, thus giving me 25°C for the CPU and 23°C motherboard temperatures. The CPU was so cooled, that my fan controller turned off the CPU fan because of the setup. If the CPU fan was plugged where it should be, it did way more RPM's and heated the motherboard to 25°C and the CPU to 27°C average. What this means, is that the CPU stock fan uses more energy than a 200 mm coolermaster fan, causing the motherboard to heat itself, thus the CPU heating itself, so that it can cool the CPU down. If I really want, I can replicate this many times and the results are the same, that shows how bad the stock fan really is.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Starting out with some interesting concepts, the film develops the characters and concepts well, weaving them into a mind-bender of a story. A bit long at 2 1/2 hours, I was nonetheless engrossed the entire time. Great visuals and great story line added up to a very entertaing evening. Highly recommended!
0345472322|5.0|I have been looking for a more in depth analysis of this topic for some time. This book has fulfilled this need and helped me to develop  a far greater understanding and respect for the Mind.  Well done Carol Dweck.<br />Paul Murtough
B000FGGERC|4.0|Not a OPETH normal output,but in my umble opinion,a classic of easy listening progressive rock.Just like is collaboration with STEVEN WILSON on STORM CORROSION,MIKAEL AKERFELDT shows is not a one trick ponny.With there new album HERITAGE,OPETH future looks good for them and us- Also very happy with my first purchase from AMAZON!I may get addicted to this...
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|hours of fun I have even got two of my friends addicted to this game and my six year old loves it to.
B007HU7NBK|5.0|Thoughtful, well-written, interesting. This is a book that anyone could enjoy. Of course, it helps if you like DD's music (as I did growing up). Regardless, this is a very good rock n'roll memoir, and I've read a lot of them. Kudos to JT for being so open and dealing candidly with his problems. He comes across very well in print, and has done himself and his fans proud.<br /><br />Thank you, John Taylor. Play that funky bass, John (or should I say Nigel?)
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great series of books well written and May can not come fast enough. Waiting always sucks but well worth it. This is the first book I read by Mrs. Day and looking for other good books of hers.
B005EHILV4|5.0|Works great! Compact and portable. If you need a basic PreAmp This is it. If you plan on recording alot might consider getting model with more inputs.
B007N85ZXY|4.0|&#34;Americana&#34; is worth getting for &#34;God Save the Queen&#34; alone, the last song on the album. Moving smartly along at a smoldering march, the song skips a few beats before the end of each verse and then smashes to smithereens the four words, &#34;God Save the Queen.&#34;  But how does a song of praise to the Queen of England earn the grand finale spot on a fond collection of Americana? Americans could care less about the Queen, and quite rightly so. Even the Beatles, who alluded to Her Majesty at times and are on record as saying she is pretty nice, never sang &#34;God Save the Queen.&#34; They chose the French national anthem (the opening notes of &#34;All You Need is Love&#34;) when they felt like reaching out for a pompous patriotic tune.  The &#34;Americana&#34; liner notes hint, improbably, that Americans may have sung &#34;God Save the Queen&#34; before the War of Independence. That's not likely, given that these pilgrims to the New World had recently braved the broad ocean, courting high risk of death along the way, in order to escape Her Majesty. But, who knows? In the world of folk tunes anything can happen.  &#34;God Save the Queen&#34; is probably on here because its melody is the same as that of &#34;My Country 'Tis of Thee,&#34; and because &#34;let freedom ring&#34; rhymes with &#34;God Save the Queen.&#34;  The former song (&#34;God Save the Queen&#34;) morphs into the latter (&#34;My Country 'Tis of Thee) on &#34;Americana,&#34; and the &#34;let freedom ring&#34; chorus rises majestically above the prayer for the queen's salvation, dethroning a queen, crowning good with brotherhood, and closing out this sampler of songs.  A very talented children's choir sings the &#34;My Country 'Tis of Thee&#34; section of &#34;God Save the Queen.&#34; Their superb backing vocals throughout &#34;Americana,&#34; together with Young's inspired, on-fire guitar parts, lift &#34;Americana&#34; several notches above a band warm-up or an eccentric experiment. One's ears might mistake David Briggs (he of the motto &#34;Be Good or Be Gone&#34;) as the producer of Americana, if one's memory had not yet processed that Briggs is gone.  Song impressions:   &#34;Oh Susannah,&#34; a la Crazy Horse, sounds a lot like the old hit,&#34;Venus,&#34; by Shocking Blue, while Neil & Crazy Horse's spirited performance leaves no doubt that Susannah's is a hip chick.  &#34;Get a Job&#34; features top-notch vocals from Neil and Crazy Horse who, from evidence here, could have been Doo-Wop masters if they had sought that honor. It's an impressive performance.  Crazy Horse's vocals on &#34;Jesus Chariot,&#34; &#34;Tom Dula&#34; and a few other songs are group shouts that do not even add up to an arrangement. But that might be the idea. An average group of Americana-loving Americans all getting together to warble out a bunch of their old time favorites loved would probably sound more spirited than special.  &#34;Like a High Flying Bird&#34; glides through some atypical (of Young & Crazy Horse) chord changes, while blazing your more typical Neil Young and Crazy Horse groove.  The rendition of &#34;This Land is Your Land&#34; here is sprightly, but .  .  this is an old, creaky Woody Guthrie tune that has never captured anyone's fancy since it was originally penned in protest to &#34;God Bless America,&#34; by Irving Berlin, or to protest privatization of public property, or something. Whatever it was that prompted Guthrie to write &#34;This Land is Your Land,&#34; the song always sounds like an appeal to hard-working Americans of the plow, sweatshop and dust bowl to please join hands and sing a song of protest for their misbegotten disenfranchisement. The disdain for private property espoused in the song, whatever it's intellectual aim, is not a sentiment that has ever been popular in the American heart or mind. As a result, the lyrics of &#34;This Land is Your Land&#34; will always arouse tedium rather than ardor in the hearts of the common American man and woman. There's more Americana in &#34;God Bless America&#34; than in &#34;This Land is Your Land.&#34; It would have been wiser if Neil Young and Crazy Horse had tried to fan new life into Irving Berlin's song. The inclusion of Pegi Young and Stephen Stills vocals on &#34;This Land is Your Land&#34; doesn't help either the song or their singing reputations.  Woody himself may not have been crazy about the song. The eponymous Wikipedia article reports that after writing &#34;This Land is Your Land,&#34; Guthrie let it languish four years or so in desuetude before recording it. Then, a year later, the song was published.  Having said that, it's not all that bad a song, and it does succeed in making you want to get up and square dance.  &#34;Travel On&#34; is performed perfunctorily, and receives an insipid rendering.  As for the band's chops on the record. This is a good band album. A problem I've had sometimes with Neil Young and Crazy Horse in the wake of the death of Danny Whitten is the band's lack of anyone to go toe to toe with Neil Young or push him, as, say, Lennon and McCartney pushed each other.  The pleasures of hearing Neil Young now and then sounding like a talented & dedicated backup singer/vocalist in Danny Whitten's band (as in the live version of &#34;Let's Go Downtown&#34;) went away with Danny when he left.  Young's star in the band, if you remember what Crazy Horse was with Danny Whitten, has shined too brightly in the band ever since. Did it have to be like this? You wonder. I heard Young play at Lakewood Amphitheater in Atlanta years ago. The band included as a backup singer his sister Astrid, who was great. Steve Cropper also had shown up to play with Neil (who was being backed by Booker T and the MG's at the time) that night. Neil Young was smoking like I'd never heard him before. By no coincidence Steve Cropper appeared to be smoking a step or two ahead of him. Young fails to get a performance push even when he gets together with Stephen Stills, since as Young himself has pointed out, they play in two entirely separate worlds even while playing together.  Thus, it is nice to report that on &#34;Americana&#34; Crazy Horse comes more to the fore.  Another plus in its favor: &#34;Americana&#34; does not feature any songs directly about the life of Neil Young. This is refreshing, because although these themes cast a genuine gleam when Neil Young was a lonely boy out on the weekend longing for a girl he saw in a movie who played a part that he could understand-- such fare got rusty a long time ago. Although his songs generally reflect what is going on in the lives of his family and friends, it's always nice when he leaves off his self-involved jeremiads about his pet peeves, pains, projects and pagan inclinations.  (Though many didn't warm to the &#34;Greendale&#34; disk when it appeared, its sublimation of Neil Young's actual life to a fictional representation of the same by way of the Greendale characters provided Young a sophistication of expression far surpassing standard singer songwriter confessionals. The album's protagonist, Sun Green and her boyfriend Earth Brown poignantly evoke both his daughter's world at that time and the youthful &#34;we'll change-the-world&#34; idealism that Young participated in himself in the 1960's).  When people standing around on a corner hear &#34;Star Spangled Banner&#34; it sometimes happens that thoughts of Jimi Hendrix invade their thoughts-- rockets red glare, bombs bursting in air, in that incomparable Woodstock solo, a bandanna around Jimi's head, his eyes closed, his soul leaning far into another universe. Maybe some day when someone standing around hears &#34;Clementine'&#34; or &#34;Oh Susanah,&#34; or &#34;Get a Job,&#34; or, better yet, &#34;God Save the Queen&#34; or &#34;My Country 'Tis of Thee,&#34; there will immediately pop into their head the fading image in the &#34;Americana&#34; cover art, of Neil Young and Crazy horse posing for their picture in Geronimo's car.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have enjoyed Pinterest very much. Pinterest is very addicting, in that every time I view it, at least two hours have gone by.  It is very user friendly and having an app to click on instead of logging on to a web site, means I'm on it even more. I have referred many people and have, not only my referrals following me, but also their friends and so on.

B008QE9VJI|4.0|As a big time Dark Shadows fan from the days of the original TV show, I was pleasantly surprised by Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's new take on an old story. Great acting, great cinematography! It left me wanting more. Maybe a sequel in the near future?<br /><br />Now onto the Combo Pack that I purchased. \\"ULTRAVIOLET\\"? WTF? The DVD and Blu-Ray also came in the package. Why would I want to take up space on my computer when I can pop in the disc? So, watch a movie on your iPhone? What do you do, use a magnifying glass so that you can see it?<br /><br />As to the content, the \\"Special Features\\" could have been more. You've got a new take movie on an old established story. You've got short cameo appearances by four of the stars of the original TV show, one, Jonathan \\"Barnabas\\" Frid, not living to see the release of the movie. How nice it would have been to see interviews with these original TV show actors. Being one of the people who went to the theater to see this movie, and of those movie-goers, most being the gray-haired variety bringing their grandkids, I had high hopes for the DVD release of the movie and seeing, in the \\"Special Features\\", the original TV actors talking about the good ol' days and how nice it was for Tim Burton to include them in his movie.<br /><br />My advice, if you liked the original TV series, if you liked this movie, Buy It!

0307950689|5.0|For the original review and more, please visit markedbybooks.blogspot.com<br /><br />Have you ever heard of the White House or Washington being overrun by vampires or some type of supernatural creature? Or about how the Roman, Grecian architecture had such a profound impact on the founding fathers of this nation almost three centuries ago?<br /><br />Sounds almost...impossible huh? Well, the first is impossible because vampires don't exist. In my mind anyways, but the rest? Well, its true and has been proven by the amazing author Dan Brown who wrote The DaVinci Code, Angels and Demons and the book I am reviewing now, The Lost Symbol. The reason that I enjoy reading his work so much is because personally, I am a fan of history such as the kind that he portrays in his books. I love anything to do with ancient history and would jump at the chance to learn more about it. Hence the reason I am going to tell you all about this amazing book.<br /><br />As I already mentioned, this book has to do with the history of America's capital: Washington D.C and the supposed secret that has been hidden under the cornerstone of the Washington Monument. It has been said in the Ancient Mysteries (which are elaborated more in the book) that the Mysteries are what will save this world from some apocalyptic meltdown. The Mysteries are what the nation was founded on and what the world will eventually end on.<br /><br />In the book, the protagonist, Robert Langdon, is summoned to the capital to give a lecture on the history of the nation and what the nation was founded on, which was mostly European culture. Don't believe me? Research it. Well, long story short, the Ancient Mysteries are brought up and the wild goose chase ensues. Well more like the wild-murderer-who-wants-to-destroy-the-world-chase ensues. Robert and his friend Katherine are desperately truing to stop the monster who wants the secret of the mysteries for his own personal gain as well as to \\"save the world.\\" Let it be known that he obviously has a twisted mind and seems to view the saving of the world to be something that would inevitably ruin it.<br /><br />Gabby<br /><br />For the original review and more, please visit markedbybooks.blogspot.comthat he obviously has a twisted mind and seems to view the saving of the world to be something that would inevitably ruin it.<br /><br />Gabby<br /><br />For the original review and more, please visit markedbybooks.blogspot.com

B000SINT52|5.0|While I'm not sure Moore got all the facts right, the fact remains that in broad strokes, this is a compelling look at how the Bush administration used the 9/11 attacks to justify making breathtakingly radical changes to American society, many of which contradict traditional American ideals such as transparency and the right to privacy.<br /><br />While you might not agree with everything in the documentary, I think everyone should see it regardless of their political stance. I believe Bush sold out the values of the people who voted for him.

1934030554|5.0|This book is a 'must' for anyone considering taking bicycle racing seriously. And if you're going to race, there's no point in not taking it seriously. Get a 'good' power meter,get Joe Friel's book 'The Cyclist's Training Bible' and get this book. The two books together will get you training properly and efficiently and will save you a lot of otherwise wasted time on the bike.
1594744769|2.0|Jacob, a sixteen-year-old boy, grew up believing his grandfather's stories were a bunch of fairy tales.  That is until after his grandfather dies and he witnesses something a little off.  He becomes convinced that there was some truth in what his grandfather was saying and goes in search of a mysterious island in Wales and Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.<br /><br />The story started off interesting and unique in the prologue, which caught my attention, but everything else beyond that went horribly down hill.  The rest of the story was boring and hard to get through.  The pictures are awkwardly placed throughout the book and Riggs relies to heavily on them to tell his story.<br /><br />Jacob is an extremely un-relatable character.  He comes off as being pretentious and obnoxious with conveniently wealthy parents.  The other characters in the story were flat.  Riggs relied only on the abilities of the particular children giving them neither individual personalities nor backgrounds.  I don't even want to start on Emma, the only character slightly more developed, and only so because she was the creepy seventy year old love interest.

B007FEFLTO|2.0|I had really been looking forward to reading Winter of the World.  The author in this book (I don't remember this in the other book I read of his) has this really short and clipped style of writing.  It's almost as if he is writing for middle school kids.  I never was really able to feel much for any of the characters as they were generally painted in such stereotypical fashion.  I kept hoping that it would get better but alas, it really didn't.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|The story line is good and the encounters are steamy. E L James is effective at raising my heart rate. However, it seemed like too much emphasis and time was placed on the sex whereas the actual storyline could have been elaborated on more.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Absolutely riveting.  I read this over two days and put the book down only at 130am because I had to get up and go to work.  I liked the characterizations.  The motivations and emotions seemed to be spot on.  Very creepy knowledge that the kids being born this year would be the protagonist's parents.  The world could very be going to pieces in a few and this be looked at as the golden age of luxury.  The novel is about escape from reality and the need to return to that reality.  Probably will be a sequel, but this stands very well alone.  My book club read this and loved it.
0240810961|5.0|I highly recommend this book to any aspiring artist or animator, especially if they admire the original animators of Disney.<br /><br />This book is essentially a collection of several hundred 1-2 page mini lessons that cover topics ranging from using your sketchbook and gesturing, to adapting and exaggerating your drawings for animation. I really found it useful for me once I was at the level when I was comfortable drawing the figure. It really helped me understand how to take that knowledge and apply it to animation. I was really happy with how well it covered such an in depth topic.<br /><br />In short, this book is worth every penny! You won't regret it if you use it!

I find the emotions very realistic, and especially that someone so blindly (in a good way) committed to another would go to such extremes... I'm glad Sylvia Day wrote it like that... can't wait for the next one... BTW, I read the entire book in 24h, I didn't sleep that day, that's how AMAZING it was :)

I was a little concerned when I read it was taken from a vhs etc but all reviews were great and I had to take the chance either way.  I was not disappointed, just wish there were more. I definitely recommend for all Michael Jackson fans, especially if you enjoyed the BAD era.
B009SRJAG6|4.0|With the plot arcs the eighth season of Supernatural will follow firmly established, Supernatural takes a break to go back to \\"hunting things...the family business.\\" In this case, murder victims are turning up with their hearts ripped out of their chests. And other people involved seem to have received organs from the same source. Supernatural mines a mythology that it hasn't explored yet in this solid win of an episode. Recommended. A-.
0553386794|5.0|I'm not going to tell you that this book is perfect, but it is excellent.  It accomplishes the single most important thing that a novel must do - hold your interest.  It gives you a great story.  I marvel at how a novelist can come up with these complicated, intricate stories with so many plot lines and characters.<br /><br />There are three major characters here - Eddard Stark, Tyrion Lannister, and Daenerys Targaryen.  There are many characters surrounding them, almost as important.  There is a rich world full of people here.  The Stark and Lannister characters are in direct conflict with each other throughout the book, while Daenerys is in another part of the world, having nothing to do with the Stark-Lannister conflicts.  The connection is that the Targaryen dynasty was overturned by Robert Baratheon, who is king over both the Starks and Lannisters, so there is a connection there.<br /><br />The world depicted could be compared to medieval Europe (\\"Westeros\\" ruled by Robert Baratheon) and to the age of the Mongols (similar to the environment that young Daenerys finds herself in, in the east).<br /><br />I'm not going to give any spoilers.  The only information that was given to me before I started the book is the warning that people die in this book.  It's not like Lord of the Rings where you know Frodo, Sam, Aragorn and Gandalf are going to make it out all right.  In this book, don't count on it.  Maybe they will, maybe they won't.<br /><br />I noticed one theme in the book, that the son of a king is going to turn out very bad if he is spoiled by his mom.  He is not going to place any value on the lives of other people.  He is not going to be sensitive to the plight of others.  This actually makes me think of some of the incredibly rich people who have run for president of the U.S.  No connection to the people of America.  Living on Mount Olympus all their lives.  Utterly ignorant of what it's like to be born in the USA.  Springsteen had a much better handle on it than the Bushes or Romney.<br /><br />I have a lot of praise for this book, but I'll balance it out with some criticism.  Don't be mad about that.  My biggest criticism is that the author uses the \\"Perils of Pauline\\" approach in several chapters, ending the chapter by leaving our hero tied to the railroad tracks with a train coming.  It's a device that I don't like at all.  To me, it is artificial and annoying to manipulate the reader in that way, to keep him turning pages.  It's also a cliche, and I detest cliches.<br /><br />I mentioned Eddard Stark first, and he is the star of the book.  He doesn't always make wise decisions.  Some of his decisions are poor and result in a lot of bad things happening.  Is that a plus or a minus, that your greatest hero blunders now and then?  I'm not calling that a weakness of the book, just maybe an oddity.  He's clearly a smart man but his choices are sometimes disastrous.  Would you like it if Gandalf screwed up big time and it resulted in a lot of bad things happening to Frodo and Sam?  Eddard's idealism comes around to bite people on the ass, with repercussions galore.  You feel like entering the story yourself and telling him no, don't do that, do something else.<br /><br />I'm trying to think of another fault in the book, besides the cliffhanger trick.  It's not easy.  Maybe the cliffhanger baloney is the only fault of the book.  I wish I could write like George Martin or Robert Jordan.  I can't.  All I can do is autobiographies and baseball books.<br /><br />Be aware that this book is not standalone.  Neither is Fellowship of the Ring.  It is part of an ongoing story, and there will be no closure at the end of this book.  You are going to read the next one.  Things are resolved but the major story lines are not resolved.it than the Bushes or Romney.<br /><br />I have a lot of praise for this book, but I'll balance it out with some criticism.

I had the original vinel album that I about wore out until some unfortunate stole it from the truck of my 68 Plymouth Fury III in 1974: Tampa Fl.  may they be reading this current rating, recognize themselves and feel some rock and roll shame.  Anyway, it was great to see it again, years later on Amazon for such a good price.  I down loaded it immediately.  I just love the songs and the way this seasoned band can play them all.  it will never be recreated.  I listen to it often and put it through my amp on occasion so that I can play my slide and pretend I am part of the old original band.  if you like  so.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|This is one of the most intelligent, realistic and surprisingly amusing terrorist thrillers I have read this year. I have been a fan Nelson DeMille's books for a long time and \\"The Panther\\" will be one of the more memorable of his books. It also marks the return of Paul Brenner, well known to many of you as the investigator in \\"The General's Daughter. Brenner and Corey make a formidable combination.<br /><br />In \\"The Lion\\" John Corey, former NYPD Homicide detective and special agent for the Anti-Terrorist Task Force, with the help of his partner and wife Kate Mayfield, killed 'The Lion', a notorious Libyan terrorist. They also stopped a plot by rogue elements in the CIA for a nuclear Armageddon of Muslim countries. Because of their success with the Lion, Corey and Kate are asked by the ATTF to become bait for \\"The Panther\\", a feared and brutal al-Qaeda terrorist leader in Yemen. What is realistically scary is that The Panther is a second generation, well educated and very intelligent American citizen of migrant Islamic parents, who becomes a terrorist when he is dismayed with the differences between Western and fundamentalist Islamic values. What is even more scary to Corey and Kate is that they find that the project is masterminded by the CIA.<br /><br />Some people might find Corey's observations and inimitable humour irrelevant and annoying, but I love them as it helps to take the strain off what could otherwise be pretty tough reading. Corey is at his best and most amusing in this book:<br /><br />1. Shit happens but in Yemen it happens hard. In Yemen even the good guys are bad.<br />2. The Yemenis have the highest birth rate of any Arab country ..... so something was happening when the veils came off.<br />3. \\"Zamo is also a martial arts expert.\\"  \\"You draw soldiers?\\"<br />4. \\"Where's Mohammed?\\" \\"Getting fitted for a suicide belt.\\"<br />5. \\"How is he?\\"  \\"Bullet passed through his brain. No damage.\\"<br /><br />For thriller fans this book has a bit of everything - blackmail, corruption, kidnapping, assassination, bombs, gun-fights, drones and hellfire missiles, all laced with large doses of double and triple-crossing. The book is mostly set, very realistically, in Yemen, one of the most remote and undeveloped third world countries. DeMille's well researched descriptions of Yemen are memorable and it is easy to see why al-Qaeda can have a refuge and strongholds in this country and similar ones in the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa. Many years ago I visited Aden on a passenger liner and even with such a short visit I agree with Corey that \\"If the earth had an anus it would be located in Yemen\\".<br /><br />I gave the book 4.5 stars (marked down because it was a bit lengthy and slow in the early stages) but rounded it to 5 stars because it really was a good read.- blackmail, corruption, kidnapping, assassination, bombs, gun-fights, drones and hellfire missiles, all laced with large doses of double and triple-crossing.

Many years ago I visited Aden on a passenger liner and even with such a short visit I agree with Corey that \\"If the earth had an anus it would be located in Yemen\\".<br /><br />I gave the book 4.5 stars (marked down because it was a bit lengthy and slow in the early stages) but rounded it to 5 stars because it really was a good read.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|Finally got to watch this movie couldn't wait for it to come out of dvd/Direct Tv and was not disappointed with the performance of Johnny Depth in this movie.  It was funny and serious at the same time.  I really like the difference in the story of how he became a vampire refreshing to me.
0061433063|4.0|I have never read anything by Terry Pratchett that I did not want to read again and again.<br />This series is aimed at teen readers but I do believe adults {me 50} can get something out of it. It is a compelling tale.
1843106698|5.0|the best thing anyone can do is learn more about the people around them. even if you think you don't know anyone with autism, you need to read this book. this is so informative in helping us see others in a different way. i think almost everyone will find that they themselves have one or more traits of these people. so by coming to an understanding of the way that people with aspergers think, they will see how they are just people like ourselves, wanting to be loved for who they are.
B007TK77QE|5.0|J.K.Rowling is a great story teller, but her real skill is character portrayal. She didn't disappoint with the Harry Potter novels and she doesn't disappoint with THE CASUAL VACANCY. Although the most likeable character dies in the first few pages, Rowling fleshes out the others realistically and skillfully over the course of this long but very readable novel. They are all flawed, vulnerable and very identifiable. Some are almost caricatures, but their stories all complement each other. As with Harry Potter, I couldn't put it down and I cried at the end. Can't get that Rihanna song out of my head: \\"You can stand under my umbrella...\\"
B008JGSM6G|5.0|so addicting!I love this game!! great value for hours of fun! I was hooked after 10 minutes and cant get enough!
B006FE83UE|5.0|best classic movie ever! its so good and so im buying this for my grandfather because in return, he gave me this movie so i could watch it and so now hes looking for it again.. great opportunity to buy this movie for him again :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very similar to the movie that was based on this book, which was a pleasant surprise since often books and the movies based on them are vastly different. I enjoyed reliving what I saw onscreen and getting deeper clarification of topics that were only briefly glazed over in the movie. I devoured this book faster than most and cannot wait to read the next two in this series!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is amazing! I am so glad it's on the kindle fire! i have been wanting it for a long time :)
B007TK77QE|3.0|the seamier life styles of the candidates for the \\"Casual Vacancy\\" & their families is revealed in this (Hog)warts and all (pun intended) tale. The language is at times coarse , but I found the story intriging.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Fun game initially, could use some variety, it would make it more interesting. Maybe make placing the tokens a little more difficult to find homes for.
B000SGSU58|4.0|I enjoyed this book enough to recommend it.  True to the early Michael Connelly books with Harry Bosch, it had the usual suspense, and a few twists and turns along the way.  I don't know why authors think that their characters have to climb in bed in every novel, but maybe that is why Harry is usally alone.  I find the sex part of the book more of a distraction, and really think the book would have been better, had that been omitted.  My best guess, is it is to fill a certain number of pages, since it really added nothing.<br /><br />Overall, the book was a good read, and is a good way to pass the time.  I can't say that I couldn't put it down, but did find myself picking it back up when I had free time.  It was easy to finish, and some books are just slow and hard to finish, and some you never pick up the second time.<br /><br />It was pretty obvious which character was the red herring, and before the end, I had figured out who the real culprit was, but I enjoyed the time it took to get there.
B001LF347E|5.0|I bought this for my son for his birthday. Needless to say this is what he's been watching ever since (Sept 17). I plan on getting the next 3 seasons for Christmas. He love shows with magic, mythical beings, and a good story line all of which the Merlin shows offer with little to no unwanted \\"adult\\" situations.
B00005OM5L|5.0|Summer, 1996 London's Hyde Park<br />  My first trip to the UK came four months later and had I known about this concert, would have changed my itinerary....I can only imagine the magic, electricicity and music that filled the still summer air amongst the crowd of adoring fans......here is truly one of the most incredible outdoor performances EVER, given by the one (if not the greatest) rock/blues guitarists living today-Eric Clapton. Thousands gathered in the midst of one of London's most serene and historic city commons on an evening filled with stars.......Mr Clapton, an ensemble of gifted and diverse musicians, a familiar list of hits, a few Claptonesque renditions of American Southern blues staples delivered in PERFECT almost recording-studio sound and perfection makes this an audio/visual orgasm for the senses!<br />  In an age in which concerts are given to raucous crowds, blaring amplifiers, exploding techno special effects, unpredictable antics of the performers and lyrics too profane to comprehend Mr Clapton transcends the typical; his vocals are soft, bluesy, heartfelt; the words crisp and clear as the stories unfold.  As of this recording his voice still reaches pitches and vibrato the years have since taken from him....thank God, the magic that flows from his soul through his fingertips has, and forever will be, Slow Hand's gift to music.  His searing riffs and the seemingly uncanny manner his fingers dance and glide down the frets of his Strat/Gibson or whatever stringed guitar he carries like his lover commands the adulation and attention of new generations of musicians and fans of all ages.........<br />  Also praiseworthy is the contributions of Jerry Portnoy, an incredible blues harmonica player whose command of the simple \\"mouth organ\\" places him at the top of his game; Steve Gadd, anything but a simple percussionist-his driving, forceful but never overpowering beat adds to the groups excellent delivery; Andy  Low, guitarist--subtle rhythyms and dual leads compliment Mr Clapton on several solo performances; Tim Sanders & The Kick Horns--what a crisp accent to all the music; never overpowering and surprisingly compliments even the blues!  All in all a gathering of friends on a perfect mid-summer's eve, a treat for all the senses......why not treat yourself to a foot-tapping, air guitar playing, visual and stunning auditory exposition of one of the world's greatest living performers from across the pond?  He is the \\"Hootchie Coochie Man\\" for all time..................
B008602KQI|5.0|The story in this film hi-lights what has happened to a people who in the future revolted against the use of them and their lifestyle.  It pits those in urban settings against those of the rural in where those from the urban \\"won\\" the war and require those from the various urban zones to provide young people to play life and death games pitting the urban center contestants against one another in life and death contests and in which only ONE winner from a dozen or so contestants is allowed. This film shows how the rulers of the urban center change the rules in the contests to satisfy the demands of the population during the game and how after the game as the \\"winner\\" goes back to the rural center from which the contestant came how the urban ruler is plotting to gain revenge on that winner for challenging the rules and overcoming the challenge.  A lively story in which the viewer soon becomes involved.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|I thought that the story line was weak and that whilst I recognise that Reacher must now be getting on in years, he reacted like a pensioner not someone who was going to take control of the situation. This is a role that an 80 yr old Clint Eastwood would be perfect for in a movie.
B009IU6N5Y|5.0|Ok so Abrahim Lincoln and m The president is gone to kill vampires.  I was shocked at how awesome the movie actually is, I  downloaded it from Apple and I think this is my favorite movie hands my top 2. The plot was great the only thing I did not see that the person helping young Abe to become a slayer is a VAMPIRE himself.<br /><br />Great movie and I recommend it.....
B000O8OTNC|5.0|really compact light wight fixture<br />very comfortable and easy to use<br />great result (I used it on My BK 2)
034580404X|4.0|Great book! I could not put it down, I had heard alot  of talk from people that it was a MUST READ! Well I am now on book 3.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Good entertainment. Requires slight thinking on your part but not hard that you get frustrated by it. Good for passing time when you're in line waiting for something.
B007BT0RKG|4.0|I have looked for an offline map for my Kindle Fire, and so far this one seems to be ok.  I downloaded both Oregon and Washington as separate downloads, and so far they both seem accurate, even pointing out stores, movie theaters and post offices plus much more.  Now I only wish my Fire had GPS...
B008TMA1LY|5.0|this basically fills every inch of my free time and I thinks its a problem. I'm so glad I downloaded this app. the only reason I downloaded tjosnapp is because I love sanrio.
B00012QM8G|3.0|Total movie night fail! Half way through the movie it stops like it was digitally damaged. It was like it was a bad copy. We couldn't finish it and had to watch something else.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I found it very hard to put the book down. While some of the events went in the direction that I thought that they would go, others were completely different and I enjoyed that. It kept my interest all of the time.
1572702974|4.0|The Mysterious Affair at Styles was Agatha Christie's first published mystery, the one in which she introduced detective Hercule Poirot and created the template for nearly all of the hundreds (?) of subsequent mysteries she published in her career.  From this very first book Christie established herself as the queen of the whodunit, writing mysteries with solutions that always fool the reader.  Although her books aren't deep into characterization or atmosphere -- that isn't the type of book she wrote, after all -- nevertheless she always managed to effectively transport the reader to another time and place.  I love her books for that entertaining, escapist quality they have.<br /><br />In The Mysterious Affair at Styles we are transported to the WWI era -- a large estate in the British countryside, where a wealthy elderly woman is murdered and nearly everyone in the household seems to have a motive.  Hercule Poirot, a Belgian refugee and retired police officer, just happens to be in the area and in a matter of days his little gray cells unravel the puzzle.<br /><br />The narrator is a British actor who does a fine job with the mens' voice, particularly Poirot's, but doesn't do so well with the female voices.  Nevertheless, this is a delightfully entertaining book.  Highly recommended.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|You should really get this game. I love it so much. You should really get this game! And it is free!!
B001DHE9KG|4.0|We thouroughly enjoyed this production.Having seen many stage and screen productions over the years this production was refreshing insofar  as the settings were different and the participants new to us.
B005ZC0SYQ|4.0|Super Romance. Kept your attention right to the end.<br />Brandon Lee was a favorite of ours. Sets were right on.<br /><br />Really Good
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I saw this film in the cinema quite a few times so I knew this was a magnificent film! I enjoyed everything from the actors to the acting to the special effects and I worship all things Joss Whedon! I love the dvd version however I would have been just as happy buying the Blu Ray alone instead of the 4 disc thing...however it is nice having the regular dvd 'cos I only have a Blu Ray player in my front room and I like watching film sometimes in my bedroom...so for that reason I like having both. This film has it all, it's got a great plot, it's got a fantastic villain in Loki played by the awesome actor Tom Hiddleston, you cannot really help but pull for him just a bit (especially if you've seen Thor first) because Hiddleston manages to give the character more depth than most other actors would be able to pull off. That young man is going to go FAR in acting! All the actors and all their characters are well rounded and Joss Whedon brings the fun with plenty of laughs (some of the humour is very BTVS if you're at all familiar with that show)and he's proven yet again that he is worthy of the worship! Really, I'm not a super hero lovin' gal but these Marvel films are fantastic and this is, thus far, the cherry sauce on a very satisfying super hero film sundae!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Dungeon Hunter 3 is worth more than just free, anyone who gets this will be happy. I reccomend this to anyone who enjoys flawless multiplayer.
B007PFD90G|3.0|Some typically sharp insights about life love and risk sprinkled in a very thick chronology of events great and small and names dropped...a major subtext seems to be the author's missed opportunities for income due to his unfortunate situation.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Bought the RIO DVD for my grandson plus a booklet \\"RIO Birds of a Feather\\". He's going to love it.<br />Well OK I wanted to see the movie :-) RIO has got to be the best animation ever made. The colors and the music are just to die for. Unfortunately some of the colors and music were replaced by a solid story line :-)
B00065MDRW|5.0|Wow, what a great album that really put progressive rock on the map! King Crimson's first album, In the Court of the Crimson King, is a bold and eccentric musical display that is the template for what progressive rock would become in the 1970's. This album has a uniqueness to it in that it features many instruments that take the listener on a musical journey via many different arrangements, melodies and changes. What we end up with are songs that are bold one minute, and subtle the next, such as MOONCHILD. The music is what one would truly define as 'artistic.' I also find the drums and percussion to be very different. My favorite songs are THE COURT OF THE CRIMSON KING, EPITAPH, and I TALK TO THE WIND. When I listen to any of the songs on this album, I can hear other groups from subsequent years and their sound as being influenced by this group, such as Yes, Led Zeppelin, and even Pink Floyd. Of course, Emerson Lake and Palmer is a derivative of this group, with Greg Lake being Crimson alumni. As for a possible Crimson influence, I'd cite Buffalo Springfield as one. This debut album by the masters of progressive rock has me curious about their other material. I recommend this album; it has lived up to it's hype and influence, and the remastering is superb.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I LOVE IT So much i cant stand it if someone tries to spoil it i yell at them but i still love it
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|good for kids or an easy game for adults. you earn coins daily. I never buy any. That is always a rip off with games. Simple and easy but fun. For a free game it is good. Doesn't take up a lot of your time.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|If you have not interesting of BDSM this book is really a dull book.<br />I was disappointed because of high rate of Amazon.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|This is by far the best product and accessory I have purchased for the PS3. I have been a computer gamer for ten + years. When I purchased the PS3, I had a really hard time with the PS3 controller. The Eagle Eye has changed that all together. It is definitely worth the money. They should probably charge more. I feel as though I'm actually playing on a PC and not the PS3. Absolutely a great product, and I would recommend it to anyone.
0670022705|5.0|Just to add my voice to the chorus of praise for this excellent book.  It is a delight - erudite, beautifully written, thoughtful and remarkably readable.  I haven't much to add to the existing reviews here and in the press, other than to say don't skip the introduction which I found quite excellent and extremely interesting.<br /><br />All the superlatives which have been heaped upon the book are - somewhat unusually - quite justified.  This is a terrific book which will give enormous pleasure.  Very warmly recommended.
1250010489|5.0|When it comes to novels and movies that involve computer security, many book authors only have a superficial knowledge and at the point where the thief, agent, etc. uses a 'sophisticated' device that discovers the code for a security system digit by digit I usually switch off in disgust. But there are exceptions such as Mark Russinovich's novels.<br /><br />Mark is one of the guys behind Sysinternals, bought by Microsoft a couple of years ago and has intimate knowledge Windows and its security architecture. And lately, he's ventured into the domain of writing cybercrime fiction. I first discovered his book \\"Zero Day\\" last year when I was in Seattle via a recommendation on the weekly Security Now podcast with Leo Laporte and Steve Gibson. Otherwise I'd probably have never picked up a copy as his name was unfamiliar to me. I read it within a couple of days and was totally addicted as the scenarios were very realistic.<br /><br />A year later and Mark has come up with a sequel 'Trojan Horse'. This time I read it on a pad instead of picking up a hard cover version and again finished it within a couple of days and didn't sleep enough during that time. He gives even more technical details in this book and the only thing he got wrong from what I can tell is that to get root permissions on an Android phone, it has to be rooted and not jail-broken. The plot is fast paced and believable, the technical details are accurate and frightening but it's good to know that the protagonist needed some help from his friends at the NSA to get certain kind of data (no spoiler here...). In plots of non-tech authors that would probably have been just a few clicks away.<br /><br />I'm totally hooked and I hope Mark will come up with another sequel. 5-star recommendation!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is my favorite game in the bejeweled genre.  Very polished game and a lot of fun to play.  Highly recommended!
B000JCSBU0|3.0|This is one of the most depressing movies I have ever seen, and will never watch it again. With that said, it was brilliantly filmed. Darren Aronofsky is really never a let down. but !@#$, this movie, ug. Make sure you're emotionally prepared, hah. I give it a 3 because I feel like Darren is way to brilliant to be dragging people down, he should put his energy into more creative movies like the fountain, in my opinion.
B009MF56GC|4.0|If you were to go in this movie, thinking it's a 80s Action Flick movie, you're going to enjoy this movie. These movie is a throwback to the 80s action flick movies that has muscular men, one liners, has LOTS of explosions, and has almost every action star of the 80s. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis have bigger roles in this movie, and even throwing in Chuck Norris with the team (well, not really).<br /><br />This is definitely better than the first movie with more likable characters, better action sequences, better pacing, and is a good time. It's no masterpiece, but if you want a movie that is a throwback to the 80s action flick movies, this is it. Can't wait for them to make a sequel.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|A very handy app. lets you know battery levels remaining plus how much time you could spend in various activities before recharging.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Really enjoy this game. Reminds me of the coin drop games at carnivals but without the expense. Have now gotten several family members to download onto their kindles as well.
B004YCKK46|5.0|It's difficult to think how a simple child's play could change your life. Sleepers reflects the action-reaction principle: do this-obtain this. Bacon and De Niro roles are excellent. Highly recommended movie, with great quality and audio. Don't dude about buying this one.
0345803493|4.0|Now this is the second book in the series (Fifty Shades). The genre is erotica, and yes there is a lot of sex in these books, graphic. So it definitely is not a book for everyone. But even if the genre says erotica, I would say it is so much more than that. The point is not in the sex. The point is about the story and the romance. So basically it is a romance book, that has erotic scenes in it. Not an erotica book with a good plot to it. Do you know what I mean with this? Well at least that's what I think.<br /><br />I couldn't keep writing notes (which is what I nowadays do with every book I read) after reading like half of the book, I just didn't want to/ have time to. On my way to work I kept reading this book till the last seconds. So yes, it was again a really good book! This story will definitely be in my favourites. It has surprised me many times and surely still will on the last book. At times I felt that maybe there was too much happening in this book.<br /><br />I just got to say one more things. These covers are beautiful! I love them. Hopefully I'll get to read the last of the series soon because I know there is some very interesting events coming up..
B004BCT2HU|4.0|There is no surprise when to listen David Garrett. He is amazing. But I didn't expect so much German language.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Gideon and Eva are obsessed with each other and I am obsessed with them. Waiting until May for entwined in you is going to be torture!!
0375842209|5.0|In the very beginning there was a short part that annoyed me, after that it was all good! Quite a powerful story. I liked the characters, I liked how their relationships slowly evolved. I loved the way this one girl made a difference in so many lives. Somehow I kept imagining her as a girl throughout the book, even though I knew she was a lot older in the end. It was easy to read, so even if it's quite a big book I would recommend everyone to give it a try, it shouldn't take long to figure if you like this book or not. A book with Death as a narrator. That just can not be not good! Also this cover is very cool I think!
B008O9V4C2|5.0|There are so many good reviews. What else can I say? Like a fine wine, Fagen's music ages beautifully along with him. The music is fresh, but distinctly and uniquely Fagen! I'm not disappointed in this long awaited musical work of art.
B008XG1X18|5.0|not sure why this isn't 5 stars. has diy and booze ideas for guys, fashion, cleaning and cooking for girls.
0345803485|5.0|I definitely loved this book! It caught my attention on the very first pages which is always the sign of a good book. It read easily and fast. The sexual scenes weren't anything I expected, even they were easy to read even if I had some preconception about it. I liked how the characters were written, well Ana and Christian, there was not much room for the others, at least in this first book. I liked that they both had more to them than one side, because that's what humans are like. An always happy person has his down moments too. The ending was very emotional and I would love to start on the second right now. But I'll contain myself for a while and read another book before continuing with the series. Definitely a book to recommend!
B003QTSMXE|5.0|Wall E is the most gangsta robot since Johnny 5! This movie is like all in up yo face with that robot gangsta shizz!!
B001ED7C58|5.0|I saw the movie (on the insistence of a friend) before I had even heard of the books.  The movie was so so, but my friend was enthusiastic enough that I read the books, which I admit I enjoyed, even if I am not a fanatic.  That said, the soundtrack is GREAT.  Wonderful music by a wonderful group of artists.  Even if you hate the concept of Twilight, check out these songs.
0345803507|5.0|Another powerful prologue. And the book keeps surprising me! It gets pretty intense in this one, not just sexually or in their relationship. There's an element of thrill/suspense in it as well. In the end bit of the book I felt like it was never ending, but still I loved every bit of it! I thought it had a very appropriate ending and I don't feel like I have unanswered questions in my head.<br /><br />I have to say that one thing I most loved about these books were their emails! And of course these book covers. I'm finished with the series but luckily I'll have the movies to wait for!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|perfect brain exercise game.  forces you to imagine a picture and then create it.  easy levels are great for kids too.  highly recommend.
B0043KK4N6|4.0|I enjoy a variety of musical genres and after watching the movie, I wanted the soundtrack!  Like any compilation, there are a few I don't like, but the balance makes up for it.
1442419814|3.0|This book started off slowly for me. I was interested in how the story would turn out, but it took quite long for me to really get into the story. In the beginning, I thought I'd only want to read this first book of the series, but now that I have just finished the book I do want to continue the series, just not right now. So my mind changed a lot during this book. It was not bad at any point, it kept getting better and better from the ok start. I would've given the last half of the book 4 stars.<br /><br />So I liked the story. But I would have wanted a little bit more out of the characters. In the beginning I also felt that at some points an event was rushed to get to another point in the story. If the story would have been written a little differently, with the emphasis on the events that were written at the last half of the book and a little more introducing the characters, I would have given it more stars. If I did not too many books to read right now, I would continue the series immediately because the ending of this one..well you know how they make these books! :)
B008TMA1LY|4.0|Everything a game should be: it's addictive and fun to get a dtrategy together! runs smooth on the kindle fire and makes me want to constantly play &quot;just one more day!&quot;  also, it is one of the easier games to run without making IAPs. It takes a lot of patience at first but once you log in for your daily rewards enough you can get the gold to buy a helper for free. be patient and wait until you have enough for kerropie, then the money you get in game grows almost twice as fast! if you have the patience to wait it out the game rewards you and you spend nothing!
B00910Y1OQ|2.0|Exceedingly repetitive, both in terms of gameplay, and in music. Nothing new or exciting to see after a couple games. No puzzles or anything that makes you think, just another uninspiring match-3game.
0525952926|1.0|Ken Follett's previous books have been great. This one was a big diappointment. The characters are thinly drawn and the effort to get into politics was  inappropiate.

B000FTWB7G|5.0|...And this is still one of my all-time favorite albums. There's something about Evanescence that makes them stand out from all the other alternative rock bands of the 00's.<br /><br />Certain songs from this album remind me of Queen's earlier work. Listening to \\"Snow White Queen\\" I can't help but be reminded of the Queen song \\"White Queen (As it Began)\\" or while listening to \\"Good Enough\\" I hear traces of Freddie Mercury's \\"You Take my Breath Away\\". Amy Lee almost reminds me of the female Freddie Mercury, both she and Freddie can combine classical music and rock music with ease.<br /><br />This album sounds like a concept album to me, each song tells a small part of a much larger story. Everything comes to an almost cinematic ending with the song \\"Good Enough\\". I could easily picture this entire album being turned into a rock opera that could play on broadway or even be turned into a movie.<br /><br />I love every song on this album, but my favorites are, Lacrymosa, Like You, and Good Enough.<br /><br />My only complaint is that \\"The Last Song I'm Wasting on You\\" is not included in this album, I guess it's because it's a B-side. That song can only be found on [[ASIN:B000KCHXUI Lithium Pt. 2]]. I really wish it was included on The Open Door though.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is great.  I flew through it over the course of just a few days, and am eager to try some of the other books by this author.  I thought the story was very unique.
B002BWCJOA|5.0|It teaches children that sometimes things aren't always what they may seem. Sometimes we as parents can't always give them the things they want.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|Overall the G155 is pretty good, it runs as it says it would and there don't seem to have and defects whatsoever, though i do have a few suggestions ..... for example ... i would like to be able to tilt the screen a wee bit higher or lower at times.  i would also like it if the G155 came with a shoulder strap as carrying gets a bit tiring at times.  i would most definitely recommend this device to those who travel a lot from place to place.
B003Q6CUAI|5.0|This is an excellent book that succinctly demonstrates the entire Dukan Diet, from start to finish.  Well written and easy to read, it becomes clear throughout that this really is the ultimate diet for reducing weight in our society. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to lose weight and especially to those of us who are obese and have so far found it impossible to permanently lose weight.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|I suppose the aforementioned reviews have it covered. (didn't read any of em).  For me here is Dylan steeped in the past of old English ballads, yes a time warp of sorts, Biblical even before all that. End of Days, the crash of the twenties, the hammering of all dreams, leaving not much more than a scant whisper of a tune, to remind us all, that even tho this is show biz, its a minstral singing before the queen, its a rounder stoking the fire as the coyotes mourn, its that deep dream in a foreign night where you wake up (like Kerouac) not knowing where or who you are...that's what this music is all about....let me add that Dylan's rewrite of Gypsy Davie is genius....( Tin Angel) an update that is transcedental....modern, filled with anger and lust, try it yerself...take an old folk song, update, try and make it relevant for today....go on...do it....what no luck.....Dylan does it like swiping a card in the money machine...

B0083SBJXS|1.0|Why the hell did Marvel only make features available on the Blu-ray discs? That's foul and just stupid. What about of folks that don't have a Blu-ray player, only DVD players? How the hell am i suppose to see the deleted scenes, beg someone who owns a blu-ray player to let me come over and watch it? Stupid!
0780619587|5.0|Shine is a masterpiece of storytelling. It is the true story of David Helfgott, a child prodigy pianist, who suffered a psychological breakdown and lost himself. The film begins with David as an adult (played brilliantly by Geoffrey Rush) and quickly flashes back to David's childhood, and we see the strain put upon David by his overbearing abusive father. Then, the middle of the film takes us through David's life as a young adult (played by Noah Taylor), in school. Here, we see signs of his emtional and mental derangement. There is a scene where he goes to retrieve a letter from a public mailbox, oblivious to the fact that he is naked from the waist down.  While trying to perform Rachmoninov's 3rd concerto - a piece of music which, according to his mentor/teacher (played masterfully by Sir John Gielgud) is maddening to play - David has a collapse, which leads to him lose his mind and turn in on himself. Later, the film returns to David as an older man. Because of his breakdown, he goes from one home to another, or stays with a friend. One night, he visits a tavern and impresses the crowd with a brilliant performance of Flight Of The Bumblebee on the piano. A woman at the bar befriends him and eventually offers him a place to stay, and through her, he meets his future wife (played wonderfully by Lynn Redgrave).  The story is far more involved than my brief summary. But, you get the idea.  The performances in this film are all outstanding. Rush won an Academy Award (and I think a Golden Globe Award too). Noah Taylor should have also won an award... his performance as young David was a brilliant work.  This movie is an award-winner and well worth the acclaim. It's a masterpiece. You will laugh, cry, and stand up to cheer.

B0084I9QI2|5.0|The Bad, 25th Anniversary Deluxe Edition was great!  I especially enjoyed the unreleased music. I hope the estate will keep on releasing Michael's stash of music and projects he had worked on. I know all his other music by heart, and listen to it everyday. My favorite tracks are I'm so blue,Song Groove,Price of Fame, Free, and Flyaway.  I also enjoyed the DVD of his Wembley Concert.Loved the poster, and the booklets with candid photos!  It was like Christmas,when I recieved it. I look forward to more of his material being released, and hope that his estate,will protect MJ's integrity, and well as promoting his legacy. I'm just sorry that Michael isn't here, to present his work, himself. He was a musical genious, and is sadly missed. There will NEVER be an artist that could EVER measure up to MJ!!!!!
B0068MNNOE|5.0|To really get the most out of ANONYMOUS, you'll need to go into the film with a few things handy in memory. First, you'll need a basic knowledge of Shakespeare's plays. Not ALL of them or anything, just some of the mainstays like HAMLET, MACBETH, HENRY V, and maybe RICHARD III. Second, you'll need to know a little bit about theater during the Elizabethan Era, and that Ben Jonson ([[ASIN:0486436306 VOLPONE and THE ALCHEMIST]]) and Christopher Marlowe ([[ASIN:0486282082 DOCTOR FAUSTUS]]) would have occupied the same circles as Shakespeare. Third, you'll have to know a little bit about what the film is trying to accomplish. Though it sets things up plainly enough, that perhaps that man we call Shakespeare may have had little to no part in writing the plays we're all aware of in some way, it doesn't really explicitly start pinning authorship on Edward de Vere until a ways into the story. By then so much is flying around, it's easy to miss that subtle build up.<br /><br />It was for me, at least - and I don't claim to have known everything listed above when I first watched the film. It took a bit of research! But that's what I love about ANONYMOUS, that it's drawing upon so much to tell a story so unique to that era. Is it historically accurate? Well, about as much as SCHINDLER'S LIST. That is to say much of what happens here actually happened, but things are definitely skewed for the sake of drama. But it's fantastic drama!<br /><br />There are two storylines at work here, with the primary belonging to Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford. He's our tormented artist and the man for which the film is building the case of authorship. He's a member of the English court, the upper crust, and, as such, is supposed to carry himself a certain way. Unfortunately, this does not extend to his writings, which are seen a kind of taboo. Nevertheless, he does continue writing in private, and enlists the aid of Ben Jonson, whom the other half of the film follows. de Vere wishes to see his plays performed, but cannot put his own name on them, so he asks Jonson to have them performed in his name.<br /><br />Unfortunately, mistakes were made, and a drunken actor named William Shakespeare ends up taking full credit for the plays we all know and love.<br /><br />The film continues to follow the growing popularity of de Vere's plays, while giving us insight into his childhood and formal education, from which he drew inspiration for his works. All of this against the background of an unstable political climate being created by Queen Elizabeth's deteriorating health, leaving the next heir to the throne in question. Throw in a few twists and turns that absolutely shocked me and you have some fantastic drama.<br /><br />The story for ANONYMOUS is marvelously written by John Orloff, one of the writers of BAND OF BROTHERS, and directed by Roland Emmerich, who steps up his game tremendously to deliver a film that more than complements the screenplay. Emmerich, an aficionado of \\"popcorn flicks\\", doesn't drift towards drama too often, preferring large scale disaster/action films, but when he wants drama in front of his camera, he gets it. As such, nearly all of the actors and actresses here turn in A grade performances across the board, with special mention of Rhys Ifans, whose depiction of Edward de Vere manages to channel the torment of an artist born into the wrong station, and the passion of a man who could write HAMLET. I also really enjoyed Rafe Spall's hilarious take on William Shakespeare, not the man who would write HAMLET, but a man who would eventually leave his \\"second best bed\\" to his wife in his will.<br /><br />All of this to say: I really enjoyed this film. It's clear that everyone in front of and behind the camera were really passionate about the source material. It's detailed enough to be historical but, to a Stratfordian, could even be counted as pleasant alternate history. Thankfully, ANONYMOUS doesn't require you to take its side over the other because, at the end of the day, it's still a celebration of the works we know as ROMEO AND JULIET, TWELFTH NIGHT, and A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM (complete with accurate performances of the plays) and concedes that although the authorship of the plays is in question, the impact they've had on the world is undeniable.ecause, at the end of the day, it's still a celebration of the works we know as ROMEO AND JULIET, TWELFTH NIGHT, and A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM (complete with accurate performances of the plays) and concedes that although the authorship of the plays is in question, the impact they've had on the world is undeniable.

Too many characters introduced to be able to follow, very heavy subject material, I am disappointed.  I dumped it from my Kindle.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much, but there are still some unanswered questions as to what Gideon was up to...such as the lipstick on the collar. He's so mysterious and they both love so hard. I finished the book in one day, I couldn't put it down because it was so good. It had me going up and down. You have to read the first book to understand what's going on in the second book. I hope that Eva and Gideon continue to have a beautiful relationship in the third book. I'm so excited , the next book can't get here soon enough. If your a 50 shades fan, then this book is a good read for you. It is better written, and has more depth that 50 shades. I think this book has more graphic sex scenes and language than 50 shades or Bared to you, but if you don't mind that, then it's a really good read.

B004OO4UFY|4.0|I first heard about this band through the theme song in Borderlands 2. Turns out, I had already heard about them before and never even knew it! The song \\"How You Like Me Now\\" has been used in a variety of places, and I just always assumed it was actually some 30+ year-old song. Yes, they sound like authentic old-school soul. I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />I wouldn't consider myself a fan of soul, really, but I find this album great to listen to. I especially love \\"Short Change Hero\\", but that could just be because it's used as the theme for the also awesome Borderlands 2.<br /><br />I loved the album so much, I also bought their 2012 release, \\"The Glorious Dead\\".

B005S9EJ14|4.0|This movie is an adventure in India that draws the viewer into places and situations not ordinarily encountered. This trek into the strange and unexpected is lead by a stellar cast of British actors each of who bring their own unique style to bear on the progress of the story.<br /><br />Initially the lead characters are identified and their motives explained so the viewer understands, at least in part, the reasons these characters are making the decisions they make which take them to the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. As the story unfolds the voyage of discovery begins for the various characters that are drawn together by circumstances and then attempt to make the best of the unexpected developments with which they are assailed.<br /><br />The movie was filmed in India and is filled with the sights and sounds of India. It is a movie of survival, the survival of the various retirees who seek a haven from high costs, and even the survival of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel itself. Who will survive and who will perish? That is the story the movie tells in a distinctly non-Hollywood manner.<br /><br />The movie is filled with color, great acting, and immerses the viewer in the chaos of the streets of India; a culture that is both alien and yet somewhat familiar. This is a movie that should be seen at least once by everyone who appreciates British drama and acting.
B00943SQCI|3.0|Tim Burton fans will enjoy this lighthearted remake of the Dark Shadows' series from the 1970's. Those who did see the original will be somehwhat let down. It is worth the viewing for comparison sake alone. This was a hit during the 70's when I remember people rushing back to the dorms to see the show and housewife's were hooked on Barnabus Collins, resident vampire. Over the years the show has come back for reruns and has a large cult following.I would not seeing it again but I doubt a TV run since they are pushing the DVD complete set for sale. If you get a chance wtach it, but I don't know if you wnat to fork out the hundrerds the serries is goijng for at this time.

0345803485|1.0|Let's compare Fifty Shades of Grey to a sumptuous dessert you see in the window of a well reputed chocolate cafe.  It's a sky-high chocolate cake that appears moist, delicious, rich, flavorful, and sinfully decadent.  You grab your fork and can't wait to dig in but you want to take it slow to really enjoy it.  You take the first bite and are surprised: the cake itself is quite dry, the icing has a bitter bite of aspartame, and the texture of the whole thing is crumbly and you find yourself chewing repeatedly to get it to disintegrate.  Huh.  You keep eating because people have been raving about this cake and maybe you think the first bite was a fluke, so you take another.  Again, you get the same icky taste and texture.  Gross!  But you have to keep trying.  Maybe it gets better... But no, it never does, and in fact it gets worse.  You get so nauseous that you can't even think of eating another mouthful.  You set your fork down in disgust and walk away while all these other ladies are shouting \\"What's wrong with you??!!\\"  Turns out the cake was actually a Weight Watchers recipe the cafe was trying to offer as a low-calorie version of the real thing.<br /><br />And that's the best way to describe this horrible book: a low-calorie version of the real thing.  What I expected when I picked the book up was a kinky, dirty, sexual romp where a hot, sexy dominant man turns a vanilla woman into his sex slave.  YES!!!  GIVE IT TO ME!!!!  What I actually got was the complete opposite: a boring, bland, lifeless vanilla woman who turns a brilliant, sexual dominant into a wimpy \\"flowers and candy\\" vanilla man.  She takes what could have been an extremely interesting story and turns it into a hideously tedious bored housewife fantasy.  Read on to hear my complaints about the trilogy.  My biggest complaint is the final paragraph.<br /><br />First problem: the author is British.  Now while that isn't a problem initially, it becomes a problem when you start reading.  You learn that the book is set in Seattle, WA (which we all know is in the US) and that Ana grew up in the deep south.  However, as you keep reading Ana's voice (and Christian's and everyone else's) starts to develop a very distinct English accent.  Ana and Christian routinely use English slang (calling an elevator a lift, a vacation a holiday, saying \\"have a shower\\" rather than \\"take a shower\\", and numerous other things that just sound... well, English).  And this would be fine, if my schema was the UK!  In fact, that would've been preferable.  I would never write a book based on English people in the United Kingdom and use my American way of talking.  And if I couldn't get it English enough I'd just say the characters are US expats.  So that drove me really, really crazy because I'd have to remind myself that the characters aren't in England.<br /><br />My next problem: the writing style.  It's incredibly infantile, and many other readers have complained about the same thing.  She should've used a thesaurus.  The way she described the sex senes was literally so boring that I'd skim the passage and move on to the next plot.  And people, I am a dedicated erotica fan!  I am in no way a prude and realize the sex scenes are the best part!  But holy cow, you can only use the same language and same visuals so many times before I start yawning and say \\"Okay, fine, he's making love to her in an elevator and she's gasping and he's gasping and they both explode in orgasm.  What's next?\\"<br /><br />Next problem: Lack of realism that is so blantant it's comical.  Yes, erotica novels are about fantasy and none of them are exactly realistic and I get that.  But seriously?  Christian is a young man in his late-twenties and is a billionaire?  And he earned that money himself by creating something that would end world hunger sustainably?  ARE YOU KIDDING ME??!?!  The only young billionaire out there is Mark Zuckerberg and while he probably doesn't have trouble finding women he's not exactly the dream boat Christian Grey supposedly is.  And come on, why would he randomly fall head over heals for a young ditz who comes in his office to give an interview and falls flat on her face when she walks in the door?  And his whole adoptive family is hot AND rich too?  This whole plot worked for Twilight because it was already super-unrealistic with the whole vampires and werewolves thing, so you might as well throw the wealth and good looks in, too, but even then Stephanie Myers gave a reasonable explanation for why she went there.  For this book, it was just shameless self-indulgence.  The lack of realism made me disengage early on.<br /><br />Next problem: The cheese factor.  Every time Ana pictured her \\"inner goddess\\" I wanted to punch the author in the face.  Seriously?  What kind of cornball imagines a hyper-sexualized version of themselves wearing feathered boas and sashaying around in pink high heels?  Who pictures an \\"inner goddess\\" doing cartweels for sex?  And the \\"inner subconscious?\\"  SERIOUSLY?!  STOP USING SUCH STUPID IMAGERY!!  The story is already bad enough without these idiotic distractions!!!!<br /><br />THE BIGGEST PROBLEM!!!!!:  The horrible and harmful stereotypes she portrays of people who participate in S&M, and the heavy implication that they all need a vanilla, boring person in their lives to \\"fix\\" them.  That's basically the plot of the trilogy.  Christian Grey is a deeply disturbed man who had a horrible, abusive childhood which is why he resorted to such terrible activities as BDSM.  His former submissive emerges in the second book as a gun-weilding, suicidal psych ward nutcase who is seriously in need of therapy.  Basically, the author portrays dominants as flawed people who feel the sick need to control people as a way to get control of their own inner worlds.  And she portrays submissives as hot messes who can't keep it together without \\"master\\" coming back in to put their lives in order.  So the only sane person is Ana, who is vanilla and extremely resistant to experimenting in BDSM with Christian, even though that's what brings him the most pleasure.<br /><br />Now here's the reality, folks.  Dominants and submissives of all age groups, genders, sexual orientations, and nationalities are pretty much just like everyone else.  I don't know any of them who have some sort of crazy \\"root\\" that \\"caused\\" them to feel the desire to dominate or submit.  They're all reasonably well-adjusted people who had happy childhoods, hold normal jobs, and live normal lives - outside the bedroom.  And what they do behind closed doors is really not anyone else's business.<br /><br />In conclusion, this book perpetuates stereotypes and turns a whole subculture into a circus and she's basically saying they need to be fixed to have happy, normal lives.  If you want some light entertainment I suppose this book would do, if it weren't so poorly written.  I really do believe this is the worst book series I have ever read in my entire life.

B0013F1D02|4.0|Based on the reviews I decided to check this out.  A lot of the reviewers mentioned that they gave it a try and liked it.  I was the same way.  Having never heard of this movie, I had to trust the folks and they were right.  With Oscar nominated Michelle Pfeiffer, two-time Oscar winner Robert De Niro and Emmy winner Claire Danes it was hard not to be well acted.  The pacing was nice, the story original and overall a good movie.<br /><br />Take a chance, you will like it.

B009SJ47XA|4.0|*SPOILER FREE REVIEW*<br /><br />I loved the first season a lot, every episode was on my must-watch list (the atmosphere it created, the pacing, the details, the way it weaved this intricate web of characters), it was honestly one of the most innovative and original shows on television.<br /><br />So I went into this episode with reservations, worried that the creative spark and magic that the first season had was just a fluke...<br /><br />But oh my god. It was amazing. They introduced a new cast of characters, and an extremely chilling new location, and I seriously thought this was just as good as the season 1 premiere. It was horrifying, titillating, mesmerizing, suprisingly sexy, and such an engrossing story.<br /><br />If you're liked the first season, you'll love this. And if you haven't watched the first season of American Horror Story, go watch it, you won't regret it!

B002WV5A9G|4.0|I've been watching Gene's original TV series forever never tire of them. Tried to get into the newer episodes next gen/voyager/deep space something and after watching was left disappointed and as for the big screen every one of those Star Trek movies were pretty dull and boring so when I heard about this one I figured here we go again same rehashed stuff-but was actually surprised the script was good not the most original but as one other reviewer noted it gave a fresh start to bring aboard new trekkies the acting was good loved how they kept to the original characters and how they started out and wound up together loved \\"Bones and Scottie from the original and these new guys did a pretty good job maintaining their personalities. Whether an old time fan or a newbie I recommend watching this movie it's the first \\"Star Trek\\" movie that actually was a pleasure to watch.

B007FG9LIE|5.0|If you've ever fallen in love with a book then gone on to be really disappointed with the movie version of it...you'll know what I mean when I say this book is intense. The fear is palpable. The characters downright creepy. I've seen dozens of movies with a similar plot - some Regular Joe finds themselves in a freaky town where something isn't quite right, slowly culminating in the chase scenes and the final face off.<br /><br />This was different.<br /><br />Sure, some parts of the story were somewhat predictable because of all those thrillers at the talkies....but there were other parts...twists and turns that made me flinch followed by an unpredictable yet plausible ending. Oh the ending!! Just.... wow!<br /><br />The only thing this story was lacking was the creepy suspense music. Dear Kindle Techs: Can you please make the next Kindle with a scary music feature?<br /><br />Alright, the nitty gritty....<br />I didn't notice any typo's or grammatical errors (bearing in mind I mostly listened to the book on my Kindle).<br />The story is written in 2nd person (he did this, she said that) from Ethan Blake's point of view.<br />Not necessarily fast paced...but lots of action interspersed with new clues or background info.<br />Tonnes of moments that made me wince and I'm sure my eyes where bulging during the chase scenes.<br /><br />Overall... a fab book, go buy it already.<br /><br />I've got to give it 4.5 stars because I had a bit of trouble clicking with the main character. I felt for him, I followed him every step of the way....I just didn't bond with him. I can't put my finger on it, Mr Crouch, I don't know what you could have done differently....I just didn't click with him. You can't please them all, eh?

B007THA4FI|4.0|It was well written and the characters are expertly drawn.  It is not a \\"happy\\" book and some readers will be sorry that it is not.  Overall, though, she gets is right in the struggles of the lower classes and the political fights that rule their lives.
0521008433|5.0|Let me just say that in response to one of the negative reveiws that this book is not meant to be \\"enjoyed\\". Language learning is by nature \\"dry\\" and to expect to be entertained is silly.<br /><br />This book contains a review of most of the theories about language teaching to 2001, the date of the 2nd edition. It contains a survey of the major trends in twentieth-century language teaching and a survey of alternative approaches and methods and also a survey of current communicative approaches. It also contains an author index and subject index including bibliographies after each chapter.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for any language teacher to develop an understanding of underlying theory and for reference.

B008FPOIT6|5.0|Mr. Penumbra's bookstore stands at the intersection of today's economy, leading edge technology, and trailing edge myths.  The fun involves the people and, to a lesser degree, the organizations that collide at the intersection.  This is a very well written, thoughtful, and entertaining book.  I am looking forward to more of Robin Sloan's work.

B009B50QOU|5.0|Let's face it.  It's the same 3 or 4 chord songs rearranged over and over again.  But they are all still catchy and great!  It takes a good, tight band to be able to pull this formula off time and again.  Billy Joe is a unique and charismatic front man, they put on an amazing live show and it is impossible to dislike the good rhythms, melodies and lyrics they keep cranking out.  The younger crowd will probably continue crying about how they've gone main stream but the people who grew up with them like I did will appreciate this without a doubt.  And Billy Joe throws in plenty of 'F' words in this album for all the whiners!

B006X5L6VS|1.0|I'm not very happy. A friend of mine has this app and I thought it was prerry cool. So I paid my .99 and downloaded the app. Except it wouldn't install and I can't use it. It was only .99 but a waste of money. I don't know where to go try and get a refund or at least another attempt to download.
B0053B347M|4.0|I have 4 of these connected to a 7-port powered USB hub that has an on-off switch. They are currently installed on a Samsung 27\\" monitor and although, not as bright as the monitor, does its job to light up my room at night. I installed one on my girlfriend's 32\\" LCD TV via its USB port and it provides adequate lighting as well. Planning to get more and placing them on my desk to extend the range of illumination.
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|There is not much to say about this book, but one thing. It reaches out to those who feel that they where put on this earth for something other than daily life, for a call that's beyond the wild, and to search for that call that seems impossible. In which daily life interferes.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|Our daughter recommended this movie to us after she saw it in the theater. We bought it on Amazon, our favorite store on-line, and loved it. We will buy the movies here, because it is half the cost of the two of us going to a movie.

B008220AVW|5.0|I loved Katy Perry's music and style ever since she made her way onto the music scene with I Kissed A Girl, but now I not only love her music but respect her as a person.<br /><br />This 'movie' gave me insight into who she is as a person behind the music and her performances<br /><br />After watching Katy at the peak of her career going through heartbreak and witnessing her maintain strength, composure and professionalism - I have nothing negative to say about her.<br /><br />This doco is a true inspirational work of art that anyone, Katy fan or not would enjoy.
B005JZBPHS|4.0|The box looks great. The only negative thing to say would be that the inserts where the cd's are stored could easily scratch the cd's.  They should be plush or soft to better protect the cds.  I had one cd that skipped a few times.  I love this show and wish it were still on.
B002WJI65S|5.0|I couldn't be happier with this product. It is a perfect size and feels really nice. I does bring back a lot of childhood memories by just looking at Goomba who took me down several times. hehe. I have him in my kitchen up on a counter just chilling.

B00129H7VS|4.0|I absolutely fell in love with the DVD. Very clear and never missed a part of one of my favourite tv war series. I would have given it 5 stars but for the fact that every time I start the thing it has to start right from the beginning of the episode and not from the place I stopped. And there is a sound jump from regular dialogues to war sounds....maybe thats how its designed but puts me in a spot as the other building dwellers dont take too kindly to loud noises.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is completely addictive. I really like that you can basically sell back your prizes for additional coins. hours playing this.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I read this book without the notion that it would be anything like the world of HP. I was very excited to hear Rowling's voice in a new arena. I have just finished the book and I feel just so-so about it.<br /><br />Although I went into this without trying to make comparisons to HP, I feel like the writing style automatically leads you in that direction. JKR's transition into the adult book world feel evident to me throughout this reading. There were many part of the book I read and said to myself, \\"You don't need to explain that to me like I'm 8.\\" It was almost jarring in a way that would make me stop reading for a while and pick up the book again later.<br /><br />It was much easier for me to read this book in large chunks, rather than here or there, however, that was a negative for me. I don't have a lot of free time, so I love feeling like I can put a book down and pick it back up and fall in love with the next paragraph. I found myself reading as much of the book as I could in a few sitting because I wanted to finish and get to my next read.<br /><br />It took me a very long time to start to feel connected with the characters. I did feel slightly more connected in the last 10% of the book, but I was tremendously let down by the ending. JKR almost had me in tears, but the ending ripped out my tear ducts and forced me to read blandly again.<br /><br />And the ending, without giving too much away, I was very disappointed. I feel as if too much is going on at once and the resolutions are feeble, if at all. I do love a cliffhanger, but I just feel empty after reading the finale. There is no resolution at the end to be happy, sad, angry, or slightly connected to, in a meaningful way that lasts after I am done reading.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have never read a better book! So many things happend! So addicting that id be reading, and forget about the world! great gob!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thought at first that this was a chick book. I mean with katniss‘s annoying indecision over peeta and gale. But this book really surprised me, the amount of blood and violence makes this book  okay to read for guys like me. Kudos to the author.
B007MAETA8|5.0|I have not listened to a lot of JM in the past, mainly because of his popularity and his appeal to females.  I had incorrectly assumed that I would not like the music.  My son is a gifted guitarist and composer and suggested that i give Mayer a listen; he said he was much more than a pop star.  While I cannot muse about his musical travels over the years and celebrate or lament where this album is in his music continuum, I can tell you this is fine work.  The lyrics are deep and the melodies have not left my head in months.  This sounds at times like an album that came out in the early 70's reminding me of America, Poco and maybe even the Eagles- I absolutely love it.  I will be exploring more of Mayer's music.  Despite his reputation and pop appeal, he is the real deal as a musician and songwriter.
B005PTYOTE|4.0|Good for the money. If your looking for extra features it has some buy it's not an ultimate edition. Good none the less.
B00640Z0RI|5.0|This book brings back so many memories, things I had forgotten, things I wanted to forget.  Herr just puts it out there like no one else.  As a corpsman I had a very close up and personal look just what it meant to be a marine without really being one.  Herr is able to capture in words the essences of that experience.  As a reporter he sure lived through some heavy shit.  I'm only halfway through the book, as I can only take it in small sections but it is a book I will read again.
B006VGGAC4|1.0|not a good read, really boring arnold should stick to movies, not that good a writer, this book put me to sleep
B004EPYZUI|3.0|It would be easy to dismiss this as an idiotic 'video game' movie except that some parts of it are quite good; a bizarre mixture of artistry and awfulness. The film starts with a few minutes of really beautiful, moody dark imagery by cinematographer Larry Fong, lovely and striking and extremely well done. Then we get into the 'plot' line, which is just ridiculous, with stiff amateurish dialog, almost a parody of a bad movie. Next we have the 'action' sequences, which are computer animated in the style of video games, with Steampunk Nazi Zombies thrown in. Hard not to laugh. It's all pasted together with some incomprehensible bits of 'philosophy' from the mind of the director, so pathetically stupid that it defies comment. Filmaker Zach Snyder has some talent, but it's limited; he was given way too much latitude in this production. He started life producing TV ads for cars and never developed the intellectual capacity for a feature film. He has a lot in common with Michael Bey, with whom he went to school, and the \\"Transformer\\" series - mindless, loud and violent movies which nevertheless find an adolescent audience. If this movie had been just an extended music video, just the dream sequences and skipping the dialog and computer game stuff, it could have been memorable.<br /><br />And yet there is the soundtrack, which is very good, with some exquisite pieces of the highest quality. Emiliana Torrini singing \\"White Rabbit\\" is otherworldly and memorable, worth the price of the whole experience. So what gives with such an uneven and inconsistent mess of a movie? Drek like this shows us how Hollywood does business; they give an idiot like Snyder $20M to play with in spite of his incoherent thinking. The only explanation - they must think they will make money. The reviews here on Amazon are all over the place, from enthusiasts to those who feel that God owes them back the wasted two hours of their lives - but on the other hand there are 500 reviews!! Go figure.<br /><br />Suggestion: Skip the movie and buy the soundtrack. And watch for the work of Larry Fong./>Suggestion: Skip the movie and buy the soundtrack. And watch for the work of Larry Fong.
B004EPZ03O|4.0|While never as artful as, say the best of the Pixar films, this has a sweet heart, and a goofy sense of self-deprecating humor.<br /><br />Definitely aimed at kids first. But with enough clever twists on old movie clich&eacute;s, jabs at 1980's culture, great little celebrity cameos<br />and kidding of standard Hollywood storytelling that there is plenty to keep a grown up smiling and entertained. Alan Arkin has a priceless<br />couple of minutes, and Jack Black proves himself a good sport indeed.<br /><br />A tip of the hat to the lead human performers Jason Segel and Amy Adams who catch just the right note of real emotion, mixed with a friendly<br />wink at the audience so that we care, but it never feels sappy.<br /><br />Segel was a co-writer as well, and created a story where we can actually be touched by his over-dependent relationship with his<br />inexplicably Muppet brother Walter. A really 'nice' fun family movie, where 'nice' is not a backhanded compliment, but as an honest one.
B000J5XS3C|4.0|I've had one of the previous model for about 10 years. As it does not have a power button ( my only real complaint) it has been \\"on\\" for about a decade. In the end, the left channel stopped working. I did some looking for a replacement, but I could not find another mixer that had as much bang for the buck as this one did. As the previous model and this one have exactly the same jacks and knobs, I was back up and running in no time. This unit feels a little bit better build wise (all of the knobs are nice and snug). The only thing I wish it had was a power button. As others have noted, the power led is pretty bright, but that does't bother me. It's nothing that a little piece of tape couldn't fix if it did bother me. I've had the particular unit for several weeks now and am quite pleased.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. The plot is full of twists and unexpected turns.Which character will get your sympathy and how long will they keep it!? Great read.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Great game.  I love the graphics and the quests.  It is fast loading and I like being able to zoom in.
0525953728|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  The life of a Seal. No secrets were revealed that would endanger any military servant of the people.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|addictive game with great graphics and a good story.  must say I was very pleasantly surprised and glad I downloaded it.
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|Let me start with the only good thing about this movie.......the special effects. And that's where it ends. I honestly hated this movie! I was so looking forward to getting it, found it in the mail today and had to sit down right then and watch it...... ummmmm,I feel like I just wasted time that could have been better spent, cleaning my house or something. Not only did I hate it, so did my daughters. Oh well, such is life....
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was very hard to get into. I forced my way through part one and am glad I did- part two was great! Pretty abrupt ending but all in all it was a good book.
0345803485|1.0|I didn't exactly like Twilight but at least that book can be considered more original than this, since it is a blatant copy of that book. And the repetition in the book really is mind numbing. But at very least I did get a really good laugh at the authors idea of erotic sex. I had to laugh at the part where Christian and Ana are taking a bath together, in the chapter where she's giving an \\"A for her oral skills\\". The part where he's suppose to be sensually cleansing her, and he puts the scented body wash on a washcloth and then proceeds to wash her \\"down there\\". LOL yeah, like that wouldn't burn like hell. Not to mention, I just was left confused by the nature of her so called friendship with that kate girl. i couldn't really tell whether this was actually suppose to be a likable character or not. But really I didn't like any of the characters, they were all annoying.

B0037B6QSY|5.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to study and practice mindfulness and meditation.  This author is one of the masters on these subjects.  So glad to see this as \\"The Daily Deal\\" - $1.99 for this book is a steal!
B00000DHRX|5.0|I will keep this short because I could really go on and on about how fantastic these two CD's are...if you liked Wham! and loved George Michael right after Wham! you absolutely have to buy these CD's.  There are two songs that I skip; all the others are fabulous.  He has one of the best voices out there in my opinion.  I am so glad I bought this.

B00127RAJY|1.0|Be warned - if you buy this DVD, you will have to sit through the entire introduction and miscellaneous instructions EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU WANT TO DO A WORKOUT! You cannot simply choose the level you want to do and start the workout because the controls, including the menu option and fast forward, have been disabled. You cannot leave the DVD in the player and simply pick up where you left at the end of the workout and just rewind to the beginning of the workout either, because they have programmed it to reset to the BEGINNING OF THE INTRODUCTION EVERY SINGLE TIME!<br /><br />I understand the need to watch this information the first time you do the workout however after that it is simply a waste of time and absolute crap that after you have PAID MONEY FOR THE DVD you find out controls have been disabled. I can not express how completely irritating and downright frustrating this is when you are trying to workout at 5:30 in the morning!. If you pay the money for the product you should be able to use it with fully functioning controls!<br /><br />And by the way, if you are interrupted in the middle of a workout and need to rewind a few seconds or so to pick back up, guess what? Can't do that either! Rewind takes you to the beginning of the segment, fast forward takes you to the beginning of the next segment! Just ridiculous.<br /><br />The workout may be a good one, but the restrictions the manufacturer have put on this product ruin it. If you want to do this workout and have a decent internet connection, get it on you tube where you can control it and not waste time listening to unnecessary information every single time you try to workout. When I succeed in making the effort to get up and work out before I go to work, the last thing I have is time and patience to WASTE!

0380973650|1.0|I wanted to read a science fiction book. I selected it based upon awards it had won. I enjoyed the first part of the book but somewhere around 200 pages i started losing interest. I hate to say this but at 400 pages i said i give up. I had no desire to finish it and i was just wasting my time trying to complete it. It just kept going and going and nothing to make me want to continue. I feel a huge weight has been taken off me now that i decided to give up on it. This book was a total bore after about halfway. Dont let it torture you onto reading it. And i really wanted to like it.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|One of the best movies of 2012.  Spectacular special effects!  I highly recommend watching this movie.  Make sure you watch the High definition version.
B001NLKT60|4.0|Having read Stieg Larsson's first book, the \\"Girl with the dragon tattoo, I could not resist reading further... I really am enjoying this book, and will probably<br />get the third in his trilogy, the \\"Girl who kicked the hornets nest.\\" Very<br />honestly I liked the first book the best so far, but then again I am still reading.
B003UESJH4|5.0|The King's Speech is one of those rare movies that lives up to its hype. It's perfectly cast. You can't imagine anyone else in any of the roles. To mention one would mean having to mention them all lest someone be slighted. They were all superb. The storytelling was emotional, imaginative, effective, as well as lovely to look at. The pacing was good. The settings were as much alive as the characters. The characters were so well written that you felt like you knew them all. Movies just don't tend to come together as well as this one does. It really is well done. It's a movie that I will watch over and over again.
B0012FHGCW|4.0|If you love a good story, well told, you will enjoy this movie. It is based on a real life, and it is neither exaggerated nor embellished. Life as it is, struggles, loneliness, quest of its meaning, healing of our wounds, the meaning of existence. This young man is obsessed by absolute truth, and he sets out to find his truth on his adventurous quest all the way to Alaska. The ending is tragic, but not sad.<br />The rhythm of this story is like breathing and the beat of the human heart.<br />Thanks for telling it!
B00884GR0W|5.0|I didn't want to pay for mine craft but I saw this so I gave ital try and this is better in some ways. it has a more involved sense with quests and experience and more mobs and plan es yoy don't need a portal for like in mine raft.  well wort five bucks
B0054SMID0|4.0|Did not know what to expect from this story, based on its synopsis, but am happy that I chose to watch it. While it starts out a tad slow, it surely makes up for that as the story unfolds. Don't want to give away more of the plot, but you'll love it if you love good detective stories, court room intrigue and some ruthless and very sick criminals getting it stuck to them in the end (almost not!).
B008220C92|5.0|Director Scott Derrickson's latest entry into the horror genre, the aptly titled `Sinister', is an instant classic.<br /><br />Egomaniacal true-crime novelist, Ellison Oswalt, moves his wife and two kids into the house where an unsettling murder involving a family of five has recently taken place. He plans to write about the incident and the missing child, who was apparently spared and kidnapped by the killer, hoping that he can solve the mystery without the help of the local authorities.<br /><br />As he stores boxes in the attic, he finds several reels of Super 8 film and a projector. Each film contains increasingly graphic and macabre footage of a family being murdered. Upon further inspection, Ellison discovers that a pale, hollow-eyed figure can be seen lurking in the background in each one of the home movies. A pattern begins to emerge, as Ellison becomes consumed with the dark secrets that lie within the films. Further investigation confirms that there are demonic forces at work, and that Ellison may have opened a gateway that has placed his family in danger.<br /><br />`Sinister' takes familiar themes and situations and spins them in entirely different directions, making the film unpredictable and highly unnerving as a result. The film score by Christopher Young is almost a character in and of itself. It accentuates the disturbing nature of the film, cranking the scares all the way up to eleven. Ethan Hawke delivers an extraordinarily nuanced performance, and this ranks among some of his best work. The rest of the cast is just as good, under the direction of Scott Derrickson, who pulls absolutely no punches for the entirety of the film. Where most directors would turn away from such material, Derrickson dives right in, creating a cinematic experience that will live forever in your memory.<br /><br />`Sinister' is utterly disturbing and the best horror film that I have seen all year. Not for the squeamish, that's for damn sure.<br /><br />Rated R for terror and violence. 110 minutes. Directed by Scott Derrickson. Released by Summit Entertainment.
B0013O123Q|1.0|20 minutes into the \\"movie\\", and you will feel physical pain at the terrible, frequency-destorted sounds that repeat themselves at nauseum, and will make you feel the pain, just as if somebody rubbed your arm for 20 minutes always on the same spot.<br />The camera seems to be mounted on a fishing rod with the line reeled out 5 yards, and it dangles wildly while it is recording, while the guy who holds the rod also makes it swing around in circles.<br />Somebody managed to get some money to waste on a camera and some celluloid. What a shame!<br />I can't imagine why anybody would give this thing any stars at all.<br />And I speak French, the language of this flick. Not that it makes it any more valuable, just mentioning it.<br />And if you wonder why I did not even make mention of the \\"contents\\" of this p. of c., here it is:<br />I think it is already giving that director wannabe too much honor and credit to even speak about what he thought was an ingeniously cool subject. Well, I won't. It would be just like opening the most stinking and gore dripping bag of garbage and detailing its every content. You would not care for that, either, would you?<br />Good.

067101756X|4.0|This book was great testimony on UFO and alien technology. Corso's experience was very small part in the larger UFO cover up and secrecy.  But his book makes you believe he was a insider or at a bigger position. His book provides plenty of insight into how Roswell was integrated into the military. It all makes perfect sense and there is nothing diabolical about it. But it is an interesting read with Birnes supplying very interesting history along the way. The only complain or suggestion I would have is that the events in the book are not always in chronological order as the author bounces around from this year to that year, sometimes in the same paragraph so it gets confusing sometime to keep events in perspective. Overall if you are interested in how one man dealt with alien artifacts and information within the US government this is a great and important read. We need more good people to come out as this fact of alien presence slowly gets disclosed to the world.
0440237688|4.0|How did I not read this book years ago? I only just recently discovered 'The Giver' and the biggest surprise for me was that it was written so long ago (1993). After reading a synopsis and a few reviews I figured it was a much more recent book.<br /><br />The political theme these days seems to me to be one of making sure everyone gets their 'fair share', of redistributing the wealth, of making sure that life treats everyone equally. This is pure hogwash. Life isn't fair. Crap happens. And no amount of federal money or social engineering will accomplish what our government seems hell-bent on trying to buy for the population.<br /><br />That's why I was so surprised to find this book written in the 90s. It's amazing to me Lois Lowry wrote about a utopian society so many years ago that certain members of our government now would be thrilled to make a reality - the non-scifi aspects at least.<br /><br />In 'The Giver' everyone's choices are made for them so that no one makes a wrong choice. There's no chance for the members of the community to choose the wrong vocation or spouse (they are assigned jobs and spouses). No one has more or less than another. No one goes hungry. No one feels pain. All the discomforts of normal life are regulated away. And should someone choose to disobey the rules they are severely punished until they fall into line or they are 'released' (a euphemism for the death penalty). Memories of the collective past are held by a single individual so that no one is burdened by the unpleasantness of past horrors or mistakes.<br /><br />It all sounds lovely on the surface, but the reality is much different. Without the ability to make choices, learn from mistakes, and grow in understanding these people become automatons who commit atrocities without knowing what they are truly doing.<br /><br />Not sure I would say I enjoyed this book, since the subject matter is so heavy, but it did give me pause for thought and cement some feelings I've had about the way I see our country heading. The more effort we make in trying to protect others from poor choices (or simple bad luck) the closer we get to the society portrayed where we will no longer have choice.<br /><br />And we will have done it to ourselves. We will have given up our ability to choose for the comfort of safety and equality.way I see our country heading.

B000I52LUO|5.0|I am not a fan of Christian Bale, not anything specific just never really cared for him, however... this movie was fabulous!!!! His acting was superb!!!! When this movie ended I found myself saying wow Bale, I completely believed you in this role. Beautifully and cleverly done! How intense it was to see him that skinny!!!! urgh! I shivered every time there was a close up of him or his bones.....guilt is definitely enough to drive someone to the edge!
B002RI9ZQ8|4.0|Really fascinating story, especially knowing that Larsson uncovered all of these incidents throughout his investigations.  Riveting, but somehow a little voyeuristic at the same time.
B004UJ6YNO|5.0|I originally purchased this album for just \\"price tag\\" , but pleasantly surprised with the most of the album. Well worth the purchase price.
B009AJD5E0|5.0|A wonderful mix. A space faring alien race seeds seemingly countless planets with life and then seems prepared to return to them and distribute not a bio-weapon, but a biological collation and collection machine. That machine, if you could call it that, is actually a microscopic lifeform with a unique form of sexual reproduction. Unlike the modes of asexual and sexual reproduction known to science today, this fantastic lifeform can breed with any species, of any size, while not only harvesting all of the most beneficial traits of its parents, but also consistently producing viable offspring. An ability of terrifying potential. Given a short time, this chimeric lifeform would essentially unite all living creatures within any given ecosystem into a single hydra-like monstrosity of unimaginable intelligence, complexity and adaptability. I saw the ancient alien race of engineers grand plan not being one of biological extermination, as was postulated by the terrified astronaut explorers, but one which would bring together nature's grand designs from all corners of the Galaxy. Imagine, for a moment, what the result of the fruits of thousands of planets' long evolutionary histories would create if brought together. It would undoubtedly be the birth of an unthinkably complex and powerful being.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Ridley Scott, this movie is not for religious people, or the scientifically illiterate, and as such it has unduly received a tremendous amount of negative reviews. As for the reviewers using phrases like plot holes, or lack of continuity, these people are either ill informed as to the definitions of these terms, or just small minded, there were no such drawbacks. Prometheus is an epic science fiction movie which juxtaposes human drama with the plans of outstandingly ingenious aliens and the dastardly deceptive robotic children of mankind. Having the overall poetic theme of being careful what you wish for was a delicious dose of classical irony. I didn't expect and didn't dare hope for a movie this deep, this scary, or so utterly rife with intrigue. Five stars.

They are so good that Archangel Michael came to me that night during meditation and said, \\"Don't speak to me through the cards.\\"<br /><br />Needless to say, I gave the cards to a friend the next day. I guess that is what you get when one of your guides is Archangel Michael! I love you Archangel Michael; you are always watching over me. xxoo

B00846REIS|1.0|The storyline on this is almost nonexistent, the characters are not well-developed nor do they have the depth that 50's did.  The vocabulary is sadly lacking also and consists mostly of crude and unnecessarily foul language.  This is a very poor substitute for lovers of 50 Shades of Grey.<br /><br />I'm only sorry that I wasted $12 of a good gift card on it. It was truly disappointing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I bought this game for my sons (ages 9 & 11). When they started playing it, they only played the version without creepers and skeletons. They said it was nice to be able to be so creative and not worry about getting attacked. Then the next day they found the other version. Awesome! Two different versions in one game. They love it! It's just like the DS or other versions of it. A+ for the pocket edition!

B0098VYKSA|4.0|Quality wise there is no doubt that both Amazon and The makers of this film took their time. The story however, without giving away any spoilers I honestly felt it was just another version of Twilight, It has a few moments worth watching but mostly it seemed more directed toward Women. It's worth watching once, twice nah not for me. ^_^

B008G8SFGO|1.0|This is garbage!  Who likes this?  I listened to this online and NOTHING about this album is cool.  Let's see...1) The album cover is some thrown together at the last minute, lame as hell photoshop job. Looks like they were VERY inspired by the logo from the energy drink because it sure seems as though they spliced the energy drink's logo and typography together to create their album title lettering - how creative!  I read articles that reported that Gene and Paul said the cover artwork was supposed to be reminiscent of Destroyer, NOPE.  Just like Sonic Buffoon was supposed to look like RnR Over, NOPE. That album stunk too. 2) The music is laughable filler from start to finish with no standout tracks AT ALL.  Just like Sonic Buffoon. 3) The 2 wannabes they have for replacements GO OUT OF THEIR WAY to imitate Ace and Peter, from their mannerisms (Tommy stumbling around on stage, Eric chewing gum while he plays - Why didn't Eric exhibit these same traits BEFORE he donned Peter's makeup? WEIRD!) to the way they play their instruments and sing.  It's SO lame. And finally, 4) Gene and Paul once again use the same tactic they used on the last album - The \\"politician\\" play. If they keep telling everyone that the album is the best thing they've done in years enough times, well... maybe everyone will just buy the lie!  That's what they are doing this time too.  Why not, right?  It worked last time!  Gene and Paul promise a lot and deliver nothing because they bank on their fans to buy whatever pathetic effort they produce because THEY say it's great.  Not fooling this guy again.  Kiss is done for and that's that.  Glad I didn't buy this album before listening to it. That's what I did with their last album and I ended up selling it to a used cd store.  Kiss should've bought it back from me instead since they lied and said it was their best effort in many years - pretty much the same lie they are telling everyone about this album.  Disgusting. I gave it 1 star because 0 wasn'tan option Amazon provides.
0316228532|1.0|In a word, boring.  I don't dislike serious books and had high hopes but one-third of the way in, The Casual Vacacny is not even remotely compelling.  I care nothing about the characters all whom so far are unappealing.  I don't think I can bring myself to finish it.
B007THA4FI|2.0|OK, I read a novel per week; I loved Harry Potter; I looked forward to and expected a different story that showed JK's writing skills.  BUT..... I have started this book 4 times and can't get pass 20%. Confusing, rambling, too many people,,,ugh.  I am going to walk away from it for now and pick it up for a 5th try in a few weeks. Maybe it's me..... but I don't think so.

030758836X|4.0|but this author can do it.  I was just sucked into this story and never saw the twists coming!  One of the things that I've noticed about Gillian's writing is that I really dislike most of her characters, but I just have to keep reading about them.  I would love to sit down with her over dinner and find out if she's known most of these despicable people in her lifetime, because most of them are really nasty, selfish individuals.  She's always fun, always disturbing, and if you read one of her novels and don't want to read another one, then we can't be friends.  Just kidding - we can be friends, but probably the kind that only exchange Christmas cards.  Make that emails.

B0071BGOJC|4.0|Seems I expected much more after reading Follett's breathtakig part one (Fall of Giants). Too many \\"just in time\\" coincidences in this second part, but there is worse. How come that the story of Willi Frunze and his wife, who gave the URSS essential data on the atomic bomb - a very clear reference to Julius and Ethel Rosemberg - gets several pages, and the Holocaust probably no more than thirty or forty words?<br />Still,  I look forward to reading Part III

B004J4WKTW|5.0|All I knew prior to reading The Night Circus was what you can gather from the title. I'd read a review that focused specifically on the use of multiple POVs and was curious because I'd never read a novel that used 2nd person narration before. I had no idea what to expect of the story.<br /><br />I was sold in the first five pages and could barely bring myself to put the book down until I finished. And when I finished, I immediately wished I could go back into the world of the book. The narration (whatever form it comes in) flows well and makes you feel as if the characters are real people you could go meet on the street. The concept is original and intriguing. This circus that, on the surface, is just an attraction for patrons, turns out to be a dynamic character itself as more and more characters experience it, change it, and grow to love it. It's hard as a reader not to fall in love with the circus yourself.<br /><br />The book is about much more than a magical competition. It's about love and sacrifice and heartache and all the other things that make us human. Well worth reading for sure.

0007466064|3.0|While Book 5, Part 1 of The Song of Ice and Fire series continues the stories of characters that readers who have stuck with the series have come to care about, the author seems to have lost his way a bit.  New characters?  Do we care?  We want to again embrace the stories of the characters with whom we are familiar.  The world in which they live has been thoroughly and colorfully imagined, described at great length throughout the books.  Great length, however, is becoming a handicap.  Another part of Book 5 follows this one and a Book 6 is promised.  All this verbage could be self-defeating.  Martin is a fabulous and engaging writer, no question, but he seemed to care less in Book 4 about the tautness of his tales and has only partially recovered in this book. The task he set himself in creating a complete fantasy world seems to have begun to overwhelm him and his solution of choice has been to produce more words than are really needed.  I have also been disappointed with his inclusion of common modern expressions that seem out of place in his world, e.g., \\"are we there yet?\\"  I noticed this little idiosyncracy in Book 4 as well.  Such slips are jarring and out of place in a fantasy epic.  I have not finished reading this book and may be rewarded at the end with improvement in the author's style and plot choices, but I'm not holding my breath.  Reading the book has become a slog through mud, really quite tiring.  I'm hoping for better in the future books.

0385344333|3.0|A poor version of the 'Jack Reacher' genre. As with the previous 2 books, they appear to have been written by 'others', or a computer generated script! Mr. Child has lost the crisp and hard narrative, in favour of churning out another (perhaps the last?) 'best seller'.
B0068THAGY|3.0|Engaging when focusing on the kids and their growth and understanding with the complexities of the adult world. Less so when it was an action movie (most of the last half).<br /><br />Not just nostalgic for a way of life, but for a kind of filmmaking, one that put story over spectacle. Which is ironic, since it's the spectacle that prevents Super 8 from being a classic.
B009SJ46EA|4.0|I was so disappointed to learn that season 2 would not be continuing the Harmon family saga. As such, I came into this episode looking to find fault because surely you can't top what season 1 brought can you?<br /><br />The fact is that this first episode has curbed some of my reservations, perhaps by bringing back a handful of the beloved first season cast, or maybe because it was a really well written and intriguing story in its own right.<br /><br />The highlight for me this episode was most certainly Jessica Lange's performance. She seemed to help bridge the gap from old to new by providing a familiar air and a concrete performance, just as worthy of the praise which she received for last season's work.<br /><br />All in all, out with the old, in with the new.

B000EHRVP6|4.0|Hostel starts out as a typical college vacation trip film, where Josh, Paxton, and their new friend &Oacute;li just want to have a good time. They get a tip that there are 'easy' beautiful women in Bratislava and of course they go. Things seem normal as they meet three women who seduce them, but they have no idea of what horrors await them.<br /><br />Hostel is not for the weak-hearted! It, along with the Saw movies, created what is known as the \\"torture porn\\" genre. The first half is more-or-less a raunchy comedy, but then after a few twists and turns, the mayhem begins. It is sick to think that there might be rich powerful people that want to torture and kill a person. The movie is well acted and the last thirty-minutes is intense, but it is also twisted.
B008XGW1CI|3.0|Why do authors study people, and why do they experiment on them?  What gives them the inspiration that keeps them going as they study people and break them into parts and figure out their mistakes and see what causes behavior?<br />Why do authors study so much and write only some of what they have learned?  Why do they spend hours to understand what happens in minutes?<br />It is purpose.  Without purpose, the author would become the subject.

0316228532|2.0|I know why you've either read, or are going to read this book. It's because you're curious. Curious as to what has Rowling come up with for adults post Potter, and if it can live up to the legend of Potter or not. I went into this with my mind still set in the idyllic childish world of Harry Potter (you really shouldn't, clear your mind and just read this book as it is) and I can tell you the exact moment that Rowling effectively shattered any childhood fantasies that I had left (it was when she dropped about 7 f-bombs in the span of two consecutive pages really early on).<br /><br />  Back when I was a kid we only had three channels, one was french, one was usually news and one always seemingly played the long running (and still going) British soap opera Coronation Street. That's what The Casual Vacancy reminds me exactly of, a bunch of old ladies that live for gossip, teenagers being teenagers and just life as you would expect in a small town with some deep secrets.<br /><br />  The premise is that Barry Fairbrother dies suddenly, and he leaves his seat open on the Parish Council of Pagford that needs to be filled (a casual vacancy if you will). But in this little town there's a bigger and more volatile problem that has divided the council long before Barry's death. The Fields - basically Pagford's version of a slum, where there's dilapidated low income housing filled with druggies, prostitutes and other unsavory characters. Soon it becomes a heated race between sides to fill the seat to either evict or save Fields.<br /><br />  Unfortunately, The Casual Vacancy is painfully slow. There's so many characters (I don't think I'll cover them all because it'd swallow up this whole post) that it takes forever to set each one up in their dull lives and the role they have in the community. Rowling takes an approach where she takes several story lines and weaves them so that will catastrophically crash together. She adds a 'shock' factor to each character to try and make them memorable, but I still had issues telling them apart or remembering them or really connecting with them - I felt like I was an observer to the story instead of really being drawn into it. It took me much longer to get through this book because I got bored and had to put it book down for a time before I'd find the will to keep reading again - but by then I'd forgotten who was who. So your best bet is to probably take notes, or read it in continuously.<br /><br />  Since Rowling started out writing for kids, there's a certain level of innocence that she had to maintain in the Potter books. But here - WOW does she ever let loose. Her characters hit everything from extremely conservative god fearing racist homophobic upper middle class folk, to stringent foreign parents, drug abusing prostitutes, rapists, child molestation, domestic violence, incest, bullying, self harm, affairs and teenagers experimenting with everything from drugs (I wasn't all that surprised with Rowling's extensive knowledge of marijuana, heh.), voyeur sex, masturbation and pornography. She even manages to sneak in some health problems like obesity, diabetes and stroke. However, things get really dark at some points, I had to sit back and actually remind myself that this was the same woman that wrote Harry Potter - I think if I ever go back and read those again it'll definitely be in a different light.<br /><br />  I have to admit I got really uncomfortable at certain parts, like when characters were calling others racial slurs, or being incredibly homophobic, or being exceptionally cruel to someone. Rowling does an excellent job getting you to think about all these things, and that they are a reality - but in the end it seems that nothing fully got resolved. There wasn't much retribution to be had against these high and mighty characters, and the lowly just seemed to sink a bit lower. Maybe that's what she wants you to think about - how crappy life can be and how it goes on, but it's not what Iwanted in my fictional reads. I wanted some good feelings at the end, and I definitely didn't feel very satisfied - there were too many \\"but what happens to these people after??\\" kind of moments.<br /><br />  There's a lot of British slang and jokes that took some re-reads before I actually got it. So that did slow down my enjoyment and speed at which I read. To show the class division, Rowling even uses a cockney accent - which was amusing at first, but I quickly grew tired of trying to decipher it (I'm TERRIBLE with accents, even written ones apparently). I can't say that the plot was completely predictable, I didn't really try to. I spent most of my time just watching and observing the intense secrets and drama unfold - which was really quite good. Ironically, all the adults seemed to be shallow and condescending, and once again it's her teenage characters that stole the show with creativity, pain, angst and the dire situations that their parents have put them in.<br /><br />It was too slow for my liking, with too many characters to keep track of. Rowling may have packed too much drama into this by addressing so many intense issues altogether, but the way it ended may just end up fueling the destructive fires in other communities that are facing these same problems. There are some redeeming qualities, but I just overall didn't enjoy it that much. If you really need to satisfy your curiosity about this one, definitely borrow it.wanted in my fictional reads.

B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Another mine numbing game to make hours fly by without noticing. Having the stories in between activities is the only time you realize you are late for work.
B0018GRAE4|5.0|The Way Of The Fist...5F Is Legit ;)<br />Not a song in the mix that gets skipped over...want a bigger rush?  Go See Ivan & Co Live ...just sayin ;)
B005K17RU0|4.0|Great information beautifully done.  Quite flexable i like it more than any other weather app. keep up the good work.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Although I enjoyed the first book in the series, Killing Floor, more than this second entry, I did like it. It's really interesting that Lee Child is from the UK writing about the US. I like his writing style. He injects just the right amount of suspense when setting up a new sequence of events, and he reveals information slowly but not so slowly that you get bored waiting for things to unfold. If I could change anything about him, it would be that he would have nixed Tom Cruise for the title role in the upcoming movie!
B009KZZM8G|3.0|The picture was not clear--almost like it had a filter applied.  In one section, the screen froze while the dialog proceeded.  I did see the entire episode which was<br />why I had purchased RECOVERY.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|There aren't many books that fit the cliche of \\"I couldn't put it down\\", but this is one. I've never read Lee Child before, and I only started the series because one of his Jack Reacher books is being made into a movie. I'd heard so much about Tom Cruise being so wrong for the role that I wanted to get used to that idea from the very beginning. Not easy to do even after reading the first two books in the series! I think Lee Child is both a gifted writer and story-teller. Although I really could live without the violence, the way Jack Reacher uses his intelligence and reasoning really appeals to me. My favorite books are those in a series with the same character(s), so I'm excited that there are many more for me to look forward to.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Knew book was for adults and not at all like HP series but I only got to the third or fourth chapter and was totally bored, confused,and the really foul language was a turnoff.  She is a better writer that what is found in this book. Maybe you should take a look at it in a library and read a few chapters before buying just to see if you will like it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|after playing this game way more than I expected to, I'm completely hooked. however there are some frustrating glitches that come up, first when my kindle is charging. usually it'll be a control issue, like not being able to turn or walk or something, but it varies. def worth the money tho!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|If you liked Frontier Trail on Facebook you'll love this game! I've only been playing for about an hour and I am having a hard time putting it down.
B007HGPBRC|4.0|this is moving beyond description.....having lost many to \\"the big C\\"..it provides invaluable insight..so sad that we have lost this amazing man/writer/philosopher...
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I downloaded Battery HD when I first got my Kindle Fire so I could see how much batery life was left without going through the menus.  I wasn't disappointed.  In fact, my mom and my sister put it on their KF's!  When I got a Kindle Fire HD, I was glad to see I could add it to this one too.  I love it and highly recommend it!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|A great way to kill some time in a waiting room or unwind before bed. Entertaining and gets more challenging as u progress.
B007MB5OCE|3.0|A fun book.  Lots of laughs.  Making light of all serious world affairs, Presidents, etc.  A lesson to be learnt, that life is always worth living no matter what your age may be.
B0087HT36U|4.0|Does it seem similar to other games around?  Yes.  But don't hold that against the game.  4 stars because it is buggy.  Certain levels are impossible to beat.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Mumford and Sons stays true to their awesome original style, and their new songs are even better. This cd plays on a loop in my car.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This is a more adult witch/vampire book that does not insult your intellegence. No worries, it's not satanic. It's just a fun read when you want to escape from reality.
B009IU6N5Y|5.0|IT WAS AN AWESOME MOVIE, GREAT TURN WITH HISTORY AND FANTASY! GRAPHICS WERE GREAT ALSO, WITH TODAY'S MOVIES, NOTHING REALLY LIVES UP TO THE HIPE, WAS VERY ENTERTAINING THE WAY IT WAS ALL REFLECTED UPON UNDERGROUND RAILROAD ETC.
B005LAIHR2|1.0|I am a child of the 80's - Rush, Iron Maiden, Metallica, Kiss, Dio, and even the classics like Styx, Foreigner, Journey, REO, etc.  This movie was pure crap.  I feel bad for even paying $3.99 for a rental.  Watch The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years instead.  Bad acting, bad plot, and even bad karaoke remakes of the originals.
B0098VXBIA|4.0|There are some days you just want to watch a chick-flick and this movie is perfect for that. It's mindless and silly, so as long as you know that is what you are gonna watch, it is good.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Mark offers great insight in a well packaged form. Sure, you can get this info from digging through his blog. But the ebook allows me to read it on my phone in \\"waiting room\\" situations. Reading one short message at a time allows me to let it sink in. Great for quick reference.
B006J386TE|5.0|I was waiting until season 4 came out on netflix, but i came across it on here! best thing i have ever found
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I absolutely love this series- the characters have depth and the storyline is about more than sex. Once I finished reading, I read it again...anxiously waiting for Entwined in You.
B005LAIHE0|3.0|My BIGGEST complaint with this movie?? The make up was horrible. I kept looking at the faces/lips and thinking something was off with my TV. Really bad--and if you notice the make up you know you're not really interested in the movie as a whole. My favorite character was played by Mimi Kennedy who shined in her small role. Very uneven and rambling in places. It's an Ok \\"stay in and watch something\\" movie but I wouldn't buy the DVD.
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|I think everyone should watch this film. It is well done and super informative. You'll never see the industry the same way and hopefully we all make changes after watching it.
B002CM03PQ|5.0|My Son is really into \\"old school\\" music and after visiting Cleveland's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, he really wanted a movie about Woodstock. I came across this Collector's Edition on Amazon and took a chance. HE LOVES IT! A ticket came inside which he laminated and put up in his dorm. He just loved all the little goodies inside the packaging. The tamborine on top is really sturdy and a nice touch. The footage itself is rich and very well done. The bonus footage includes some of the 'flavor' of the 60's as well. Great gift.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I have enjoyed this game.  I like the challenge and it's very colorful.  I play it a lot while I'm nuring my baby.  :)  Keeps me entertained and keeps me up on those long nights.  Great app and the price was right!  I love the free apps of the day!
B007M45PMU|5.0|I can't get enough of the song Ho Hey. Love the folk sound and the deep meanings of the songs.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is a good game.  it challenges you to place your coins in just the right spots to get the best results. I am still learning,  so I 'm still interested.
0143119680|5.0|I have not put the book down.  It is a Romance and an Adventure.  The references to the Wiccan customs are right on.  This book is on my top 10 list.  Cant wait to start the next book in the Trilogy.  :}
B0063IH60K|5.0|If you like to play Solitaire, you will like this app.  It is easy to learn how to play and....you get to Win most of the time.
B008SVFX96|2.0|Unfortunately I must agree with Audiophile's opinion. The cd is really overcompressed and overlimited. Also I find that the equalization is very unbalanced towards the low frequencies. There are no dynamics, the sound of the drums is terrible (you can't quite hear the cymbals) compressed as it is, in every song a low hum prevails. Listening to the album at a high volume is so tiring. I'm Richie's fan, I honestly prefer his voice to Jon Bon Jovi's and I love his music but even I, who sometimes tried to record something at home with Cubase and a modest pc, would have done a better job with the mastering. The only decent parts are those where Sambora only plays the acoustic guitar and sings, but when the other instruments come in, the sound becomes dark and confused, with no \\"air\\". It's a pity because the songs are beautiful and I don't understand how this happened: as far as I remember, the first two cds were recorded in a decorous way. Maybe it's because of the new independent record company, I don't know what to think, but this album really needs a remastering.
034580404X|5.0|Sexy characters, action, romance, thrills, hot scenes, secrets....I could go on! Even read it to my husband and pulled him out of the t.v. for a change! Loved this trilogy and want more!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I've been a fan of Rick Riordan's greek flavored series sense he came to my school and read us an exerpt from his first book \\"The Lighting Thief\\". He has kept me hooked up to present and this book is no disappointment in his series of excellent books. It was thrilling and managed to make my jaw drop a couple times. I recommend it.
1452110581|5.0|you will laugh outloud!it's what every cat is thinking.if you have cat's you will know just what i mean.it's funny.
B008MLNDEO|3.0|Amazon continues to make buying music a nightmare. All this is is a folder with MP3 files.  Yet Amazon continues to throw monkey wrenches into their system as often as they can.  This purchase was slightly better in that all I had to do was download, yet again, their downloader.  The last purchase was sent to the cloud player, and I guess it was pretty cloudy since the purchase never showed up.  I had to actually call them and have them get it fixed.  I informed them that I do not spend money so that somebody else can have the files.  Anyway the download is down. however it took two attempts after the downloader was downloaded again.  I am tired of typing the word download.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. best app ever. best invention ever. I'm addicted to it. no app better than thus one.
B00136NVH4|5.0|even after 30 + years this album still rocks.<br /> give it a listen again. appreciate the words<br />now that we are all mature, or not...
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I like it so far. Should have fine shed the book before I saw the movie. The movie has a very young Liz Taylor. I do recommend the book by L.M.A.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This was a wonderful series. I started off downloading the kindle version for my son to read and we started to buddy read it together. He was not excited about this book but once he got into it, he couldn't stop reading it! I downloaded the rest of the series and just finished reading them. Now i can talk to him about what he read in the book. Great themes about friendship, accepting others imperfections, carrying on when things get tough; I have already recommended this series to my friends.
1401233376|5.0|It came in time and the condition of the book was perfect, brand-new.<br />Has one of the most amazing DC storyline. Great read. Highly satisfied.
B0013F1D02|5.0|I read the book a while ago and very much enjoyed it.  The movie is just as enjoyable in a different way, as movies are meant to be.  The 12+ age guideline is a good one for parents, as I am not sure my 9 and 10 year old are completely ready for the movie.  The movie talent is impressive and does not disappoint.  I am surprised this flew under the radar when it was released.
B007XNAQPG|2.0|I was so looking forward to this Duran Duran DVD! But by the 2nd song I was so annoyed at the over Editing! I counted and you get at the MOST just 4 seconds before it cuts to another camera. Then they also cut to black and white, then back to color! I mean who wants to sit through that kind of crap! Your eyes are just settling down on Simon or the Band and BOOM, cuts to another camera, then goes to Black and white, and also uses cheap tricks like making the lens shake or have colors smash along with the song, aka \\" A view to a Kill\\". I mean come on!! Every 4 seconds or LESS! Real shame too as the Band is GREAT! The color film is stunning High Deff, the sound is superior 5.1 Dolby but this whole DVD is just RUINED by the massive over editing! I dont know who did this, but I guess they wanted to make a name for themselves by showing they can make use of all the cameras and make it so fast paced that only someone with ADD can watch it!<br />  Duran Duran is rock royalty now, they are an old band with most of their fans in their 30's and 40's, no 40 year old wants to see a DVD edited like this! Maybe a 20 year old might enjoy it, not me!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is not the typical sequel because it captures your attention right away and pulls you in for all of the action. I am going to read the third book now! I loved it but the ending was a little confusing
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This app helped me free up over 3 gigabytes of usless internal storage space that was not being used my me or my kindle.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I recomend this game highly, for someone who has<br /> a desire to test their patience and skill.<br />Keeps you guessing and gets you involved , to try<br />and better your score the next time.<br />Gives you just the right taste of action.<br />The longer version is MUCH better !!!!!
9063692560|4.0|This book is split into 3 sections. The first one is EXTREMELY basic. Could be easily skipped by service professionals. The second section has really good insights about service design processes but its not very relevant to field service operations if this is what you are looking for. 3rd section is full of very good examples.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Reacher needs to gain a little personality depth with age.  The drifting super soldier appears to go unchanged with his life experiences.  Starting to get to be a tired personality like Travis McGee and Spenser.  This one carries on in the genre with new bad guys and new evil empires but the woman is predictable, the relationship development is repeated, the dialog copied and the bittersweet departure has been done with every novel in the series.  This one almost \\"jumps the shark\\".  Will read one more in the series - if Reacher does not mature at least a little then it is not much better than the dreadful Left Behind series.
034580404X|5.0|I couldn't take my eyes off the books. I read the trilogy in less that 2 weeks. And I started to read them again. I fell in love with that hunk of the man even with his 50 shades and all. It's so sexy and erotic, it keept me awake for hours and hours. I can't wait for her next novel!!!!!! Thank you so much.<br />NIDZA
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|great game...I couldn't stop and was late to work....yeah, you heard me.  I had never played his type of game and found it challenging as the tasks got more complicated.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The app works great! totally addictive! the only negative is that I spend way too much time on this app!
B0080OJBQW|5.0|adam is always a blast to listen to if you are in a party mood... perfect balance of electronic work and vocal ability
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Fun game! Simple but addictive. Lots of quests, which I like. Great quality for a free game. You should try it out!
B0082EFM2C|5.0|great album! very fun and cool just like haley. i loved listening to her on idol and this keeps the same cool voice alive. the writing isnt perfect, but its her first album so that is expected
0984183523|4.0|I ordered this book to help prepare for interviews with a couple consulting firms. Victor does a great job of walking through how to structure your thinking for the case while avoiding getting bogged down in too many different frameworks.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Really nice and useful app.Simple and easy to use.Helps my children when they get stuck in math.It has the most frequently used math functions.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I had a very fun time playing this game. I would suggest you purchase this. You get to win coins to get more games.
0316228532|5.0|When Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was published, I was nine years old, and I devoured every page. I have continued to delight in Ms. Rowling's work for well over half my life, and now (at 24) I have just finished The Casual Vacancy. Once again, I have not been disappointed.<br /><br />I'll grant that the story is often tragic, and the themes often dark, but Ms. Rowling weaves her tale as skillfully as ever, and tinges it with just enough comedy (though certainly of a different nature than Harry Potter fans are accustomed to seeing). The final fifty pages passed at such a blistering pace that I was genuinely sad to have to put it down.<br /><br />If you're expecting Harry Potter, forget about it. If your sensibilities are too delicate to deal with some (often depressing) adult themes, look elsewhere. But if you like a good story, The Casual Vacancy is definitely that. One of the best novels I've read this year.
B00005JKES|5.0|I was only four when Twin Peaks first aired, but I'm a huge David Lynch fan and I've always heard my mom talk about this show fondly, so I began watching it online. After the website took all the episodes down I was left without the show I had quickly become obsessed with. I hoped on Amazon and got both seasons and finally got to see how the second and final season had ended. This product was wonderful, all the first episode was not included but I'm finding that's normal with most Twin Peaks DVD copies. I know you can purchase the pilot sepretly but I really wasn't to upset by it because I've already seen it online. This is a wonderful series to own if your a Lynch fan, if your a new comer or an old friend to the strange little town. Just sit back with you piece of cherry pie, damn fine cup of coffee and enjoy.
B008K5T5AI|5.0|I'm always amazed at Banks' wild imagination and The Hydrogen Sonata doesn't disappoint. It has lots of ship to ship interaction and crazy ship names reminiscent of The Interesting Times Gang in [[ASIN:0553575376 Excession]]. In this outing Banks really let's the ships off the leash, displaying awesome power and  hitherto unseen aggression. Not as dark as his previous novel [[ASIN:B0085S12EW Surface Detail (Culture)]] more of a rollicking adventure but no less profound with it's allegorical questioning of religious texts and insights into political corruption. I hope He never tires of writing Culture novels.
B008J34466|5.0|The entire CD is fabulous.  Pink reaches out to us all again with stellar lyrics and powerful emotions.  This is a MUST HAVE for all Pink Fans!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Loved it - no doubt there are some security trespasses in this book. Just because unclassified info is in print -  does not mean it's unclassified. I'm sure the author knows this. Thoroughly enjoyed the book - and the background info on the author's career and steps leading up to raid.
0374214913|4.0|Sloan's book read for me like an update of Harry Potter, but more to the point and thankfully shorter and more readable!  Both books told  parables--good vs. evil, love vs. fear and retreat, friendship vs. power.<br /><br /> For what Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore is, I give it 4 stars.  For what it isn't, I would give it 3 stars.  I had high hope when on page 60, two of main characters discuss the changes of and in our brain--hardware and software--caused by environment and culture.  One character says:  \\"Each big idea like that is an operating system upgrade...Writers are responsible for some of it.  They say that Shakespeare invented the interior monologue.\\"  Ah ha, I thought.  This book will talk about the changes we've made and where we could go--evolution of our thoughts, our brains, our minds with or without physicality.  My mind immediately went into revery with the vision of how/why homosapiens made cave art.<br /><br />But the story, with its themes and parables went other directions--enjoyable.  A good beach or plane read--admirable.
0143145088|5.0|Wonderful book and I love that the audio book is read by the author.  Great advice and very interesting ideas.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I bought this item so that I would not have to go from house to car with the cord that came with my kindle.<br />It has been very handy while traveling to be able to charge my kindle while on vacation. Great item.
B008PE9GSA|4.0|I had heard all of their hits from back in the day on the radio, but this was my first ZZ Top purchase. And it was a nice surprise. I love the thumping bass sound, so I'll give credit to producer Rick Rubin. Some of my favorite tracks are \\"Chartreuse,\\" \\"Drive By Lover,\\" \\"Consumption\\" and \\"Threshold of a Breakdown.\\"<br /><br />Note: I bought an exclusive edition from another retailer. Also, the packaging is how I like CDs nowadays. I'm not big on the easy-to-break jewel cases.
B008QE9XD2|1.0|Rented on DIRECTV and have to say enjoyed and appreciated the 1970's humor.  BUT the first 5 minutes was of a drag queen movie preview.  It's not that we feel \\"to each his own\\" but we feel movie previews need to be appropriate for all ages, and in our opinion this was preview did not meet that standard.  We Called DIRECTV and they said studios who own the movies are responsible for such previews.  We are now afraid to purchase the dvd and just feel that people should be aware of this fact.  And we also will not support a movie studio that takes such liberties.
B007NG93CK|3.0|I found the book a bit long winded, I actually skipped a few pages due to too much explaining on a particular subject.  I wouldnt give this book to a friend who asked for a riveting book.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I cant believe the twist of the book, Tomas should totally be with Brenda and tearesa should go die! amazing
0525953728|5.0|People are missing the point--this was written to provide an accurate account of what transpired the night UBL met his worst nightmare--the US Navy SEALs.  It was not written to be a literary masterpiece (absolutely no disrespect intended.)  The first thing you learn in writing is- know your audience.  This book is sure to be looked at differently as time passes by because the author had the forsight to record every detail while fresh in his mind.  Everyone knows that memories can become destored as time advances-just watch any Thanksgiving visit where the \\"kids\\" come home to share a simple meal...it never is.<br /><br />I have taken to heart what the author asked at the end of the book and decided to make a difference.  His charities will be happily donated to by me on a yearly basis in deference to him and all his SEAL brothers. Marc has shown what it means to serve GOD, COUNTRY and his fellow MAN with nothing expected in return.  Truly an American Hero.<br /><br />GOD BLESS AMERICA. GOD BLESS THE US MILITARY.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This app is more fun than the one on Facebook. You get the things you need so you can p in a reasonable amount of time.)
0375507256|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The characterization is masterful and the mundane of another era comes to life more fully than in any other work I've read. His use of archaic language adds rather than annoys and the visuals he evokes makes it easy to understand why this will soon be released as a \\"major motion picture,\\" though it's hard to imagine one doing justice to this intricate work.
0385344333|4.0|Always enjoy Jack Reacher novels. Amazed w/Lee Child's details on American geography & military knowledge. He makes his \\"antihero\\" likeable and most of all believable. This wasn't my favorite of his works. But still pleased & as always look fwd to any new book he writes. But Tom Cruise as Jack, hmmmm have to see that to believe it.
B008133DO8|5.0|Fantastic entertainment! There is a lot of unimaginative junk out there, this on the other hand is great television. I really enjoy the music, characters & storyline.
0525423656|5.0|The book is great, almost finished.A awesome follow-up to matched.A little hard to get into but worth it to keep reading.if you like this book, you should try divergent.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Different from other hidden object games I've played.  This is one of the first games I've downloaded to my kindle.  Looks like this game can get interesting as you move through the different levels.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great and very addictive game for the solitaire lover. I can play this game for hours on end without getting bored.  It's a great time killer when you are sitting in the waiting room at the doctors' office.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is the most addicting app that I own. I'm ALWAYS on it!!! No problems with the app at all! Love it so much!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Make certain you have your popcorn and drinks BEFORE you sit down to watch this tense, dark, well-written TV series, because you won't be able to turn away from the TV a second once you start.  My family has become addicted to this action-packed, mystery involving the CIA, the government, terrorists and the dynamic acting of stars Claire Danes and Damian Lewis.  The actors and writers deserve all the awards that have been given to them.  Not written for children.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I love the combination of search and find with the rest of the puzzles. Definitely worth the 2 bucks for the game. The in game hints and skip button make it a good fit with younger kids who enjoy the puzzles but aren't quite experienced enough for some of the solving needed. I haven't played expert mode yet, but I will in a couple weeks when I replay. hopefully it has some replay value.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I bought this cd for basically just 1 song, but i have found that i like quite a few of the tracks on the 21 cd.  Adele has a beautiful and unique voice and she is very talented.  Thanks to Amazon for the speedy delivery.
1401322786|2.0|Totally disappointed reading the Timekeeper, after anticipating another great Albom book. Albom's attempt to produce a thought provoking story instead left me scratching my head. A total waste of time spent reading it, the opposite of it's objective I suppose.

1568363842|4.0|Dive right in and get to the point. Not light weight but not over bearing. Structured for advancing in the language for a wide skill set. Any person with a genuine interest can greatly benefit from this book.
B000SEKNUK|5.0|Thanks for this book ! It really changes my life. Indeed, when I want to find something as a new door to open my mind and to resolve my difficulties in balancing between social life and professional career, The Art of Possibility is shining that door. I used to read a lot of how-to books, but, in fact it is hard to follow and some of them just taught me how to do, not changed my mind and my way of thinking. Through wonderful short stories from authors, I experience great steps in my thinking about this world. Knowing and learning how to do something are easy, but feeling, trusting and acknowledging to follow something are really arduous. This book transforms me in the second way.
B0060D3BWK|5.0|This movie has always been a favorite. Sarah jessica parker has never looked better. And definately top 5 Bette Midler movie.
0142501123|5.0|This book is GREAT! It might be my favorite book to read to my kids. YOU MUST BUY THIS BOOK! I hadn't heard of it before but picked it up because I wanted to get my kids some Halloween books. I am SO glad that I stumbled on it!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book, A love story with some mystery and surprise to it, I can't wait for the next book to come out.
1603420398|5.0|This is amazing one person had wrote that there were no pictures I think she may had been thinking of another book because mine has actual picture of each thing no a drawing . Really wonderful designs it really opens s many possibilities. Could not have been better .i would recommend this book to everyone
B007THA4FI|4.0|I am reading this with bated breath: it's hard to put down. Just when you think you know enough about particular characters, something new happens to them, or they make something happen to someone else. As Miss Marple of St. Mary Mead village might have put it, there is much wickedness in village life, under the surface. A very adult novel. I didn't expect Harry Potter, and J.K. Rowling is simply stretching and limbering up her literary muscles. More power to her! It can be a disturbing read, but the exaggerated evils are there to make a point about hypocrisy. Real life can be just as unsettling. I alternate between really enjoying this and biting my fingernails down to the nub. You decide!
B009CPJHY4|3.0|I had high hopes for this movie, especially given the actors involved.  However, it was without much of a plot - very predictable.  Not much depth.
B005LAJ212|5.0|This is a great series and I received it in plenty of time to watch before the current season - I recommend.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This simple game is addictive fun and reminiscent of brain training games I have played in the past. While the concept is easy to grasp the game remains challenging and only grows more so.
B0058YPL66|5.0|This is just a fun program.  The only thing that gets a little annoying is the flashing between the fairyland and storybrooke but I don't know how else they would present two parallel storylines at once.???
B008XG1X18|5.0|i dont understand why people keep givjng it bad reviews its a great app if you already have a pinterest account on the computer. It tends to &quot;not respond&quot; a lot, but besides works perfect.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|fun!  i don't actually play a lot of games on my phone but got this as the faotd and I like it a lot.
B0091REZMW|5.0|it is so awesome and fun and rad and there are no gliches or hacks in the system!!! rad chad rocks!!!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I saw the original ALIEN in 1979 end of my junior year in ART school. 12 noon and got a free pass/ screening to see it. It was one of the most INTENSE sci-fi movies I ever saw and it had Hitchcock-like psychological edginess not seen before. It created a whole new gengre within Science Fiction films.<br /><br />PROMETHEUS gives us insight into the famed \\"space-jockey\\" and how he ended up on LV-233. I hope Ridley Scott creates another in this series. . .[[ASIN:B00011V8IQ Alien (The Director's Cut)]]
B008HK3XOU|4.0|A case is a must for the Kindle Fire.  This case works well especially for videos.  The audio is very good.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|It took awhile for me to catch on to this..but now I can't put it down. Can't wait for part two
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This has quickly become one of my favorite series. Can't wait for the 3rd book!  Just wish I didn't have to wait.
B003B02PFO|5.0|I have always loved Christmas and the story ended happily. Christmas is  lot work but it' s worth all the effort.
0345803493|3.0|I wanted to see what all the hoopla was all about. So I finally purchased 50 Shades of Grey. I get it now, it's nothing like I've ever read before.  I couldn't put the book down. After reading the first book I immediately ordered both book II and III. I couldn't wait to see what else Christian Grey had planned for Anastasia.  I received both books within a week.  As always Amazon never disappoints me and neither did this book triology!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|easy to use and has great editing options.  it has quite a few filters and shows what they will look like before applying them.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|The summary for the Kindle edition goes \\"Chapter 1, Chapter 2, Chapter 3,...\\" and that is useless, because the chapter titles don't have numbers. Suppose I'm reading a Sansa chapter and need to remember something from the previous chapter. How to find it using the summary?<br /><br />As for the book, it is great. Many complain about the lack of action, but it makes sense after all the fights and plot twists of A Storm of Swords. It's A Feast for Crows: after the war, the crows come and feast on the dead. This book deals with the consequences of the events in A Storm of Swords, and have a lot of political plotting, Westeros back story and insight at the commoners and the effects of the wars on them (mainly through Brienne chapters), what somewhat balances the previous books, highly focused in the lords and their game of thrones.<br /><br />The absence of many main characters is a decision of the author to avoid breaking the continuity of the individual stories too much. With so many different characters playing their roles, I found it a good decision. It would be painful to wait a hundred pages between two chapters of the same character.
B0061S073A|1.0|On my settings I have checked \\"Lock on device reboot.\\"  This is supposed to start kids place on device restart.  It doesn't work.  I wonder if having my Kindle off for a certain amount of time disables this feature because it worked at first.  But I need parental security all of the time because it's not my kindle, it's the kid's.  Because of this I have to keep looking for another option to make my (I mean her) kindle a safe environment.  I was even willing to deal with the lack of clean access to the library.  I had to rate one star because I do not wish to have to enable the app for her every time she picks up the device.  That would completely defeat the purpose of having a parental control feature in my opinion.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this is a fun and good game its very challenging for this game you really have to use your brain to get past most of the levels
B008O9V4C2|4.0|Have listened to this twice now and it's like other Fagen efforts, it just grows on you.  A lot more guitar hooks this time around.  Disappointed that it's not available as an SACD or DVDA.  Dynamic range is reportedly squished by compression according to folks on Computer Audiophile and Steve Hoffman forums.  For a musician and producer that supposedly get audiophilia and high fidelity, this makes no sense.
034580404X|5.0|Absolutely addicting! Extremely erotic, with a good story line that keeps you wanting more! I fellin love with Christian and want to be Anastasia!
