B004SJ3BCI|3.0|My husband and I both downloaded this game to our phone...MANY TIMES. I love Angry Birds, but after awhile it would just stop working
B009ZQFSRA|4.0|I had never heard of this movie before, boy am I glad I streamed it. When I read the cast of Christian Bale and Taye Diggs, honestly I was curious to see the two work together. It was a very good movie that kind of reminded me of other sci fi movies set in the future with a political overtone. The movie was full of action and some unexpected turns, and overall good movie.
0316228583|4.0|The book should have been shorter. The author is expecting a lot of the reader to wade through 500 slow-moving pages. Three quarters of the book is background, with all the \\"action\\" coming at the very end.  Most people would find this book boring unless they are interested in personality studies, particularly character defects. None of the characters are likeable or truly happy. One of the takeaways from this book is the drawbacks of living in a small town. Another point seems to be that we never really know the innermost thoughts of another person, even our spouse or immediate family members. And, if we did, we probably wouldn't like them.  The book makes you question whether anyone is really nice deep down. The book is very thought-provoking about the human condition if you can get through it all, but one is left depressed.
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|It's rare to find an album that doesn't have you skipping tracks. It's even rarer when the album is soley produced by the artist.  Tyler is a musical genius hi melodies and beats draw you from the first song to the last.  I bought it almost two months ago and still cant stop listening to it.
0385343248|5.0|Shogun would have to rate as one of my all time great books, one of those books that if you were wrecked on a desert island you'd pick to have with you (along with The Lord of the Rings). I read it when it first came out in the 70's and was thoroughly engrossed in the days it took me to read.<br /><br />In recent years I had studied a little of the time of the what the Japanese call the Sengoku period, and then reread Shogun with the knowledge I had gained of the late 1500's and early 1600's in Japan. James Clavell has very cleverly written a novel using real people to tell his story. The John Blackthorn character really existed (he's based on the the life of William Adams). Toronaga really existed (his name was Tokugawa Ieyasu and what a story his life is - worthy of mini series of its own). The Morika character is also a historical character but this is where Clavell has used his writer's creative license as the real woman had been dead for some years before the events of the book occurred.<br /><br />This book is the story of John Blackthorn and is a rich tapestry of the characters and politics of a time of great historical events in Japan. It tells of the rivalries between the English pilot and his Dutch crew who find themselves stranded in a strange land where the hated Portuguese priests have already established themselves and have some influence in high places in Japanese society. He is a stone thrown into the pond of the Catholic church in Japan, creating ripples that the priests are trying to calm, and it relates the moves and counter moves that were occurring in the struggle for supremacy among the daimyos (warlords) of feudal Japan following the death of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. And ultimately it tells how Toronaga was the great puppet master, using people and events to his own ends in his quest to become Shogun.
B000SC245E|5.0|I was happy to find that Amazon had the lowest price on this OEM Brother belt unit. The replacement was easy and took about 5 minutes with the included instructions. Once I closed up the printer and started printing again everything worked perfect. Two things to be aware of when changing the belt unit: 1. Take a can of compressed air and blow out the dust and toner residue from the interior of the printer, and 2. Make sure you follow the instructions to reset the END OF LIFE message for the belt unit as it does not disappear on its own, but that is printer related and has nothing to do with this purchase (just some advice).
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this app.  It is perfect when I travel! I can easily access the book I am reading at home on my kindle.  I would recommend the app.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I am a great mahjong enthusiast and I enjoy any mahjong game.  They are challenging and mind boggling but a lot of fun
B009EEFTMC|5.0|this is a very addictive  game esp when you are timed.  It is good for both<br />adult and older children
B005ZB91KY|5.0|this was a fun movie - we enjoyed.  The 3-d was great.  The action was well done and the story was great for the whole family
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Intriguing plot.  I do not care to see other people having sex, and would deduct a half star if I could.
B000RLH2VM|5.0|Very entertaining and action packed.  It kind of makes you love the bad guys.  The cast delivers a convincing performance with just a few weak spots.  The car chase scenes are awesome.  Definitely a mans movie or a woman who doesn't like the romantic genre although Natascha McElhone deliver some the heat.  Great movie and pure entertainment.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I have played escape games until no more interest me. I found this and started on it almost 2 weeks ago. I don't play consistently maybe only an hour a day. I am not very bright about thinking outside the box so to speak but this game is a total joy. Really have to look, pay attention to clues and figure it out.<br />I love it and have no idea when it will end. As I solve one part of the puzzle and there are more. As I said been playing it for weeks.<br />I am totally occupied and every thing is solvable without cheating but it takes time.<br />You will love this if you like puzzle games and it has fabulous graphics.<br />LOVE IT
B00F91RYL8|4.0|It's a Brad Pitt virus-zombie thriller. It's no more and no less. Brad breezes through this at times predictable - but thoroughly satisfying popcorn popper. Sit back and enjoy.<br /><br />-AM
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Wonderful book with lovely message! Must read for any student of philosophy. The story starts and ends with a great message and most of us can relate events to something we would have experienced.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Great price (I think I got mine on sale), and exactly what we expected. All the Harry Potters on blu-ray without tons of unnecessary extra content. Classic family films the whole family can enjoy.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|This is a pretty good game, almost as good as the last one, but it's kinda getting out of hand.
B001BR7CZW|5.0|I am glad you keep this awesome movies ready for us to order. This one came timely and it is checked out often in our library.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I love this game and it's so addicting but I only gave it a 3 stars because with the new download for Halloween I never got the new costumes available and can't find how to trouble shoot in order to get them! If I have to delete the game I will lose everything I have got do far. Anyone have any suggestions? If so contact me at Fyrfly5@aol.com. I'm desperate! I want the vampire so badly!!!
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|The writing is sparse and unimaginative, pandering to the basest testosterone rush. Feels like a cheap clone of Robert B. Parker's &#34;Spenser For Hire&#34; series.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|Mine won't work I downloaded please help this game is the world's meanest ever some body tell me how to fix it
B0068MNO4S|5.0|Great movie for this genre.  Dark and suspenseful.  Extremely well written and directed.  Its a movie to watch over and over.
B00005JLIU|5.0|This movie i seen several yrs ago...i seen it on amazon and got it... well, very funny light hearted comedy. A must have movie...the characters in this movie are marvalous....good story line...never boring....all in all a good movie to watch..i wont tell totally about the movie...just get it....loved it....
B005COO1X6|3.0|this book was okay, i felt like it ended too early. it left me wondering what was supposeed to happen next..
B00CIVLZ3U|4.0|It turns out that Brandon Sanderson delivers the goods in a modern (slightly futuristic) setting just as reliably as he does in a standard fantasy setting. While this isn't his best book, it is enjoyable and kept me interested from the first page to the last. He's written better characters, more interesting settings, and more polished prose, but that's more of a complement to his other work than an insult to this.<br /><br />Is it enjoyable? Yes: if you like Sanderson you'll like this. He starts with and interesting premise and runs with it. It may not be a book for the ages, but it will certainly get you through the weekend.
031623480X|5.0|This challenges everything you thought you knew about nutrition -- about cholesterol, fat, grains, etc.  Read it!  It changed how we eat!
B006ZAZ31U|4.0|I know the belief in god is a dominant force for Adam and a moral compass but I felt saturated by it early. Religion was referenced to later and was necessary to get a picture of who Adam had become. That being said, the book was another look into the darkness of warriors
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|This story is over the top in so many ways. All good ways. Mostly the characters because it is Dahl after all. The points he makes about human values and the adult world through a kid's eyes are always poignant. Almost all the adults are SOO bad I can't stand them which is one real talent of this great writer. Danny Devito did an awesome job of bringing this to the screen and I think any kid can relate to the message of hope and individuality.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Simple logic fun, longer than other flippix.  Great for when your stuck waiting at the doctor's office, or school  pick up line.
B000089770|4.0|There are scenes from this movie that will roll in your head for weeks if not for the rest of your life.
B0026S93C0|3.0|Not sure what all the hype is about. Maybe I should have watched this when I was younger but I found the story boring, the music obnoxious and the acting was pretty bad.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat.  Understood the wife's feelings and inner conflicts throughout the read. Great story line.
B005LAIHR2|1.0|Unfortunately, it did not work. Just refuse to play. I plan to return it for another, maybe that one might work
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|A very touching story. The plot is a bit predictable, but the author keeps you interested in the characters lives.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|There is only one way to describe this game, fun, fun, fun. Everyone should try this, they won't be able to put it down! I absolutely love it.<br />Karen
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|The CamScanner works exactly as advertised. It was easy to install and set-up. It has done everything I expected from this app.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is well worth a lot more than you have to pay. If you like games that will make you think then this is the game for you.
030794560X|5.0|For learning and training English it is perfect! I've great moments with this book. I thinks it will help me a lot for my English course.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Very good book, could not put it down. I would definitely recommend this book. I would rate it a 4 out of 5.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I like the fill in the blanks in this book.  Loved the character Johanna.  Enjoyed the growth of Katniss.  Have recommended to several people.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|It is such a good plot, well done, all characters are as real, storyline well done. I think one of his best sadly guess studio didn't have faith in people understanding real interworkings of legal system and failings as well.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Hated killing of characters that could have contributed so much to the story. Katniss goes from strong to a zombie in this book.  No \\"fairytale\\" ending is not a problem but didn't care for how unrealistically it ended.  I really don't recommend it like I did the other two books.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This game is pretty fun. Totally worth getting. Great for passing time when you are bored. Almost done with it.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I can't update it from Google play or whatever. It's sucks...And it keeps asking me to...I mean I could but I have a tablet not a mobile phone!!!! Jeez -.- still use it everyday all day...it's fb...Lol
B000FBFML6|3.0|I am enjoying reading this book.  Although, I have found in both book one and two that it takes a long time for much to happen.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This is a great game.the first time I played it I was impressed with the graphics.if you look closely at the&nbsp;work&nbsp;you will see fish jumping out of the water. The way they show the hit. Of the shot is great.just a great game.I'm a hunter and I love it.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This author gives me a reason to care on several levels.  I found myself immediately rooting for the protagonist, the world evokes in me a desire to explore it, and the system of magic is well worked out and believable.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The game  is a lot of fun to play, but there are a few glitches here and there, mostly in the store. I can't access any free gem offers for example.
B008VVT51U|5.0|This is one hilarious, heartwarming movie. Dench and Smith are their usual fabulous selves. You get a true feel for life in India.
1781162646|2.0|The book starts off good but then becomes so hackish as it races to a somewhat tepid and contrived ending.  Strip away the Psychic Disabled Boy and the other clap trap you could have had a really good rite of passage book.  It rings false in the end.  I find it hard to believe this is the same King who wrote The Shining and 'Salem's Lot.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|I enjoy playing Angry Birds because it is a stress reliever for me.  I get lost in the game and feel relaxed.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I am enjoying using this stylus with my Kindle Fire HD.  It makes it easier to write on the Kindle with rather than my fingers since I do not text on my phone, and I haven't quite developed that skill.  Being older, the fingers aren't as nimble as they used to be.
B00992CF6W|5.0|They should add caves and like the computer edition and all they things on there. If u agree press yes
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Does everything I expected it to. The drag and drop feature is great. Nice to have a window into the Kindle file system.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I can see how the people who are in my life are doing and stay in touch with people who are not in area many life out of town a great way to stay in touch.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Book 4 of the series was a bit tedious (for me) as it did not go into detail about some of my favorite characters.  This got me up to speed, although it doesn't explain how some of the characters that we thought might be goners are actually still alive and kicking.  Guess that's why there's a book 6 in the works.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Large numbers make the screen on this app easy to see even outside in glare. It is set up in a manner that is as  easy to use as any calculator.
B00F6HOW4M|3.0|Drake always have some great beats bit his songs all sound the same his lyrical content forthe most part has the same thing every time talk about some thing else
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Love it I'm the first one to get this game on kindle fire hd lol I love this game good job glu also much better than deer humter reloaded
B001UTW7QU|5.0|No interruptions, just watched as many as I could squeeze into my time.  What a luxury!  I just love it!!!!!!
075669812X|5.0|This is now my 10 year olds favorite book as he loves ninjago lego. Quick deliver and a bit cheeper on here than his scholastic order. nice hard cover.
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|THE STORY  WAS GREAT. THERE IS PLENTY OF ACTION.  THE ACTORS PLAYED THEIR ROLES PERFECTLY. I SAY THE WHOLE FAMILY WILL LOVE THE MOVIE. HAS A GOOD LESSION AS WELL.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|Johnny Depp is a fantastic actor. He is so handsome. He can play any part. I love his movies.,& him. I love this movie. I bought it for the women in my family for Christmas this year. I want to get the Lone Ranger also for them. I really love the Pirates of the Carribbean movies. I am 71 years old,& I think he is the cats meow.lol.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very easy install, works beautifully, great picture!  Very reasonably priced.  I use it to watch Netflix and You Tube on our HD flat screen TV, the loading of the pictures is fast, the quality of the picture is fantastic!  I am really happy with my purchase, I would definately recommend the Google Chromcast!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|THIS GAME SHOULD COME WITH A WARNING LABEL __&quot;VERY HARD TO STOP PLAYING&quot;! I HAVE 2 OTHER HUNTING GAMES AND THIS GAME IS BY FAR  BEST. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT IT'S  FREE!
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|The writing was unlike any other book I have ever read.  Hands down one of the best books ever.  Makes you think
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Amazing book.  Laughed and cried.  Everyone in our bookclub loved it.<br />Even if you are not a dog lover, you will remember this book.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|The minions are so cute and funny, and the girls, too. I love the transformation Gru goes through, and the hints about where his dastardly nature came from.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This was great -- certainly hope they have a sequel  Having so many of the super heroes in one movie turned out to be a real winner.  And love most anything Robert Downey is in.  Keep 'em comin'
B009JZSC9S|5.0|The stories are layered quite well.  The acting is very good. I am looking forward to watching more episodes in the future.
B005G5PPGS|3.0|Reading this book now after watching the A's perform so well in 2013 makes it just as relevant today as when this book was first written.
B00634GHJA|1.0|Either I could not understand how to use the program or<br />your techs there were right - this does not work with a Mac.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Intellectually stimulating. Found the story line parallel to life events. I would recommend this Author and book to other friends and family.
B00CO4KGYA|3.0|Mediocre game, but not bad for fun.  Would like to delete it from my android phone, but had a hard time getting rid of it.
B00CT5NDHQ|4.0|Be careful when ordering the Blu Ray version!!!<br /><br />There are two versions of this movie:  R-rated (106 minutes) and Unrated (108 minutes).  Note that the image clearly says \\"Unrated\\" and the running time is 108 minutes, although the product description itself does not explicitly say R-rated or Unrated.<br /><br />I purchased this, thinking I was getting the Unrated version.  The R-rated version showed up.  Called Amazon, explained the situation, and they sent a replacement.  Still got the R-rated version.  Called Amazon again, and they sent a second replacment.  Still got the R-rated version.  Called Amazon and asked for a refund.<br /><br />I did find the Unrated version on the Walmart website and have ordered it.<br /><br />Imporant to note that my two times working with Amazon Customer Service, that they were very nice and helpful - no complaints there at all.  It's just that whoever is packing these is putting in the wrong version.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|Excellent game! Recommend it highly. Great for kids and adults alike.  However, the graphics is a bit low class and crass.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Enjoy more than solitary. I am looking forward to the upgrades and more advanced versions. Graphics very easy on the eyes.
B00DV2D0JC|4.0|With a nice mix of HOG and mini puzzles, an intriguing premise and the occasional scare, this game maintained my interest all through to the end, which is saying a lot since it is quite long and involves some revisiting of scenes. i would have given it five stars if the graphics were a little better. having said that, you can't beat the (current sale) price and will be worth every one of the 99 cents you spend on it.
0316789798|5.0|This book brought back many memories. I got it when I was a kid at a school book fair. I can remember wanting to draw the dragon SO badly. I got this for my son's 10th birthday and he went crazy over it - even more so when I told him I had this when I ws his age... and then HE drew the dragon! Great great gift. His 6yo brother even made a few of the drawings as well.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|This is Kat from Victorious...a show my son and many young middle school girls watch.  Before her 1st hit song broke on pop radio...I NEVER knew she was this talented....She is so young, cute, talented and often hits octaves like Mariah Carey...great album with some 50's throwback-feel, pop up-tempo beats and some slow ballads like Almost is never enough done with her boyfriend Nathan Sykes from The Wanted
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wonderful read, great imagination.  Brings you right into their world of depravity as well as gluttony.  Resembling our world now multiplied by great tragedy.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Part of the greatest TV show ever made!  Love the extras and outtakes, and &#34;behind the scenes&#34; included in each season....
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Have not used it much but I got it so I could start using other apps not sold by amazon. Hate that s*** and al glad someone smart showed me a way around it. Nit gonna pie though I used this app to get google chrome
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Part of the greatest TV show ever made!  Love the extras and outtakes, and &#34;behind the scenes&#34; included in each season....
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Thank goodness for Elizabeth Gilbert and her talents! Alma's story is our story. Live life and never stop living! Bravo Liz! Bravo Alma!
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Part of the greatest TV show ever made!  Love the extras and outtakes, and &#34;behind the scenes&#34; included in each season....
B00AHGSVKS|3.0|Meh.  Dated, deterministic, filled with holes I doubt Clarke would create now that he is older and wiser  Written by Clarke when he was still young enough to &#34;know everything&#34; apparently.  Immature views on human relationships, superstitious stuff in there, etc.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Part of the greatest TV show ever made!  Love the extras and outtakes, and &#34;behind the scenes&#34; included in each season....
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|This album is different from his normal work but it is definitely a good listen. I would recommend it highly.
1400052181|4.0|Enjoyed this book, especially the realization of how recently cells have become an important research tool.  We all enjoy direct benefits from discoveries based on these cells......<br />There were parts of the story going into the dysfunction of HeLa's family that added nothing to the story for me.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I bought it to replace my copy that was never returned to me. The story was uplifting, funny and great animation.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book brought complete closure to this story. It left me with a sadness for the characters who died but new faith in all of mankind.
B00E6890VC|5.0|Non manufactured pop with meaningful lyrics in this day and age? This album is one the rare ones where you can play it from start to finish and love every track which works out great since this review is for the vinyl LP.
B009JZWO3I|4.0|Love this show!  Last season I stopped recording it because the Amazing Race always went over it's time slot and my DVR never recorded the entire show.  I got frustrated and stopped recording the show.  I've been so excited to catch up, since Amazon offers the show and previous seasons.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|A movie you can actually watch without awkward over the top raunchy jokes!  A funny comedy safe for the whole family, Barbara Streisand was very funny, it was heartwarming and sweet.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Very well written examination of historical events around the time of Jesus, with interesting referencing to the time of the prophets and the Hebrew bible. Many of the historical facts are not included in similar texts and Mr. Aslan's research and bibliography are extensive. A valuable read for anyone with an interest in history in addition to Christian legend.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|Downloaded this game for my son and he loves it. No problems. Likes the new angry birds and the things that they can do. Its an addicting game.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This book was a page turner from the beginning.  I loved reading about his inspirational pilgrimage and the great story line behind it.  Wonderful descriptive writing.  I would have loved to have more back round information about Queenie's past life but perhaps the author wanted us to perceive it ourselves.  I will gladly read another Rachel Joyce story.
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|It started out OK, but wasn't really funny.  It is a memoir, so if you have ever wondered about Tina Fey's life, this will answer some questions, but it wasn't very entertaining.
B0035LMTZA|2.0|Seemed like only the most bare bones writing took place in order to make a Mini commercial. Poor dialogue. Enormous plot holes (sure, you need to suspend disbelief for action films but this was a bit much). Stereotypical characters.
B00D1VKZ3M|1.0|Maybe it's me. Maybe because Bridget and I are about the same age, I could identify with her in my 30s and got a lot of giggles watching her fumble through life. But fumbling through life in your 50s, still obsessing about weight and men and cigarettes? Not so funny. The diary entries are self-indulgent and paranoid and annoying.<br />***SPOILER ALERT***<br />Mark is dead. Brige is a widow with two young kids and a much younger lover. And I honestly wonder if, prior to writing this book, Ms. Fielding's people could not secure Colin Firth to play Mark in any future film adaptation and thus she changed the story line. Because, why on EARTH would you kill off Mark? A really wonderful book would have taken up where the last one left off, telling the story of Brige's wedding and marriage to Mark and the arrival of a Darcy heir.<br />But jumping - what, 12? 14? - years into the future and finding the exact some woman with no insight, no maturity and no self-respect was really disappointing.<br />I got through about 4 chapters before contacting Amazon for a refund on my kindle purchase. It was THAT bad.<br />(Also, I dont' why I was able to purchase this book prior to publication date, but I was....)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever! Love it! I enjoy playing it all the time! I love all the different characters as well!
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Okay yes, there's tons of needless explicit sex and nudity. Usually to be honest, that kind of stuff just makes me uncomfortable. However, this show is so worth it, you can almost ignore it. By season two, it's calmed down with all the sex scenes anyway. The actors are all amazing! the scenery is beautiful. I really didn't know anything about the actual Tudors so I went into the show knowing absolutely nothing. I found myself googling a lot about it while watching. It’s pretty accurate. I really felt like I got to know Ann Boylen and even though she was kind of evil, felt myself feeling so bad for her by season 2. I absolutely love this series. They did such an amazing job. Like others have said, it’s hard to just watch one episode a night, it’s pretty addictive. P.S. The King was a total jerk! - the end ;)
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Want the game I know how to play it already duh! Why would you show the game and then when you order it . You find you cant load the game. Something is wrong with that don't you agree?
B003YL4LYI|5.0|There are so many loose ends that have not been tied up.  Hated that there are no real answers to the majority of the characters dilemmas .  Not a fan of this book.
1781162646|5.0|I find that no matter what I read of King's work brings me great pleasure.  He is only writer I still read from my middle school days (now I'm middle aged).  The characters are easy to relate to and make you genuinely feel for them.  The setting makes me wonder how many times Stephen King has ben re-incarnated.  I always feel as though I've increased my wealth of experiences when I read a King novel.  The color and detail to description leave me feeling as though I have witnessed a private movie screening in my mind.  I've even forgiven the tiny font of the paperback and the lack of a Kindle format which forced me to order the book overseas (and that shipping is killer).
B00371XIJE|5.0|Great movie. Richard Gear & the dog were amazing!!!  A tear jerker at best so be prepared to cry your eyes out.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|While all of the Longmire novels I've red so far have connections, they do not need to be read &#34;in order&#34; to be enjoyed. However, if you read them out of sequence, as I have mostly done, then you will find yourself wanting to quickly &#34;fill in the gaps&#34;!
B00846REIS|5.0|...Gideon Cross has roared into my heart and taken over. I enjoyed every word of this book from page one to the last. I can't wait to read more about the new, seriously-screwed-up man in my life.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Wheat Belly is a good stepping stone on your way to a healthier diet and makes a good case for giving up starches in the early chapters. I found wheat belly's recipes comforting while I was on my way to eating unprocessed foods, it allowed me to say goodbye to my old ways of eating - cookies, pancakes, pizzas, oh my! - and move on slowly, while also letting me cook meals that I could share with my family and friends who still love starches and flour based foods.  Now I don't eat those kinds of things at all, even wheat free versions.<br /><br /> If you absolutely CANNOT live without the usual bread-based products and you've got time on your hands, the book is a great collection of recipes to satisfy the desire for familiar foods with less guilt. But if you don't have time to buy all the various wheat substitutes and DIY things like loaves of bread for your new wheat-free sandwiches, you may find the book less useful.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|The character development and the life experiences of the North Koreans at this time in history is beautifully written with an appreciation of their plight.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|Fabulously rich characters with a exciting & compelling storyline full of twists & turns, just can't get enough of it, a great read.
B007IK44CK|5.0|Best Mission Impossible Movie That I've Ever Seen! Tom Cruise plays his part very well in this movie.  I recommend it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|They had me at Despicable.  This game is similar to Temple Run, but much better.  A bit addicting, so be careful.
B009DALSSG|5.0|I've had this gamepad primarily for my computer running Windows 8. Due to it having no cd to install, it's completely plug n' play. The analogs are very accurate and I find little difference between the xbox 360 controller and this one. If you don't mind having a cord, it's decent. And the cable has plenty of length from my computer being about 3 feet away from me and with room to spare. Every game on my PC works with this controller and the games recognize the xbox buttons immediately with little to no configuration in the games themselves.
B00ET0PZDO|3.0|THE GAME TOOK MORE THEN 99 Coins from me. Besides the game is great. I brought other escape game and like this one the best. Should be more then 14 scenes but it's still good. Stop stealing coins and and the right amount and you might stay in business. Please submit back to my account the coins you stole. Very unfair and under handed.
B007KZY1YY|4.0|Who cares if it is repetitive, it is hot and I enjoyed the story. Soft porn for bored women basically !!!! B
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Beautifully written and an eye opening look into life in foster care. Enjoyed every minute of this very engaging story.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|I love this little editor, it;s easy to use and has a lot of functions for and instant edit.  You can take a picture, edit it and have it online within minutes.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very addictive.  I finished all the levels oncethen reset it so I could play them again. This game is fun and challenging for all ages.
B007N8RULO|4.0|I love this game but I can never do it with more than one suit so it's an ongoing challenge!
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I love this show, it reminds me of the old movies with Spencer Tracy, Katherine Hepburn, Cary Grant, etc.  The mix of humor and drama, the witty dialog.  Just really good TV and a great cast.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Easy to read and use it does the job.  Could be a little louder.  if you want more ring tones you can upgrade for a couple of dollars.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book as will any reader who enjoys action and space fiction.  Now I must find another by this author!

B006IDG2T6|1.0|Dear Sam:<br /><br />Is your belief that \\"free will is an illusion\\" based on logic or brain chemistry?<br /><br />If it is based on logic, then congratulations! You alone, among all humans who have ever lived, actually possesses the free will to veto the dictates of your own brain chemistry. Can I have your autograph?<br /><br />If, on the other hand, your belief is based on your own brain chemistry, then welcome to the back of the bus with the rest of us walking zombies. Since your belief is based on brain chemistry rather than logic, there is no particular reason to suppose that it's true -- adaptive, perhaps (and perhaps coincidentally logical as well) but not reliably logical, even if your brain chemistry compels you to believe it is.<br /><br />The assertion that \\"free will is an illusion\\" is a self-refuting statement based on breathtaking intellectual vanity. Even if it was true we could ever know that. We could only \\"believe\\" it, and even then only for as long as our brain chemistry compelled us to believe it.<br />It's amazing how a brilliant neuroscientist can get so caught up in the fine details of physiology that he builds his entire intellectual edifice on an embarrassingly basic logical error. It seems a waste of time to spend 66 pages giving us all these logical reasons to believe that our beliefs are based on brain chemistry, not logic. Please forgive him; his brain chemistry compelled him to write the book. Based on his own thinking, however, it might have been a more persuasive course of action for him to have skipped writing this book at all and simply invited us all to a banquet and slipped something into our drinks...
B0040I09RM|5.0|I was feeling left out every time my husband was watching SOA. Then Charlie Hunnam was cast in Fifty Shades!  So, when I got my Fire, I decided to take advantage of my Prime & catch up. I am obsessed! The writing and characters captivate you. The acting/casting is perfection!
B00F8802SE|5.0|Great start to the season!  I love how the show focuses on the day to day struggles and interpersonal relationships to drive the storyline and not just the zombies.  Excellent show and a great start to the season!!!<br /><br />I've been using Amazon prime for the Walking Dead since season 1. It is one of three shows I watch all year. The episodes are typically released several hours after they air on AMC so we are typically just 24 hours behind \\"regular TV\\" viewers.<br /><br /> I highly recommend HD for the extra $1.00. At $2.99 an episode the total cost depends on how many episodes are released. Last year it cost $48 for the season, of course I can still watch all those shows anytime i want so I think it is well worth it.<br /><br /> When you buy the HD shows you get access to the SD ones as well for tablet and phone watching. Even if you can't watch the shows in HD right now, I would still buy that package because you will be able to eventually and like I said you get the SD version too.<br /><br /> I'll adjust the star rating appropriately when the season actually starts. I can't wait for Monday (Oct. 14th) because that's how the past three years have worked with the show on prime! (Side note in the past three years all episodes were released within 24 hours of the airing on AMC except one in season 2 which took almost 3 days, I assume it was technical difficulties)<br /><br />Since I see a few people worrying about the January 1 2014... Last season and season two had similar dates like that and they still released the next day... I am very confident this season will be released on the same schedule as seasons past.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|Not bad, not great, worth the rental price, but not much more. Have to say that the Rock's acting seems to get better all the time. Bruce Willis is just another over-hyped, over-priced actor. They should have save a couple of million and got someone else to play his part.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Good story about small coastal town life. Excellent casting and acting, beautiful scenery. Kept me looking forward to each episode.
B004ZNACA6|5.0|As an avid Pink Floyd fan, the recording of the audio in this set is awesome!!! Clear, detailed and sounds I've never heard before.  Thank you!!!! :)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show and look forward to many more seasons to come. Nothing on tv right now like this.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|very entertaining. not just for kids. very challenging<br />love the graphics, addictive<br />I play it all the time. Thank you
0761172726|5.0|So far this is the only calendar that seems to work for my family, I still like the visual, non electronic, way to see all of our activities. This calendar gives enough space to write down every one's daily activities, appointments, and reminders.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great price for an amazing show! I purchased it and watched it immediately! I would def recommend purchasing on amazon!
0399215980|3.0|The book was too small for me to read to the class.  The children had a very hard time trying to see the pictures, as I was reading to them.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is probably one of the most exciting book I have ever read. This seams like the perfect video game material
B006CHML4I|4.0|So far this a great watch although it fell behind a little on time although this may be my fault other then that great watch
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Great case. Thinner than the others & longer lasting. Only issue is port capabilities require an extender due to waterproof flap.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Really enjoyed this book. Drama, romance, the end of the world as we know it to be. With a positive ending.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I can talk to my family and friends and see what Is new in their lives and make new friends
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|&#34;What an excellent book,&#34; she thought as she sobbed into her burrito at Chipotle.<br /><br />Seriously though. SUCH a good book. I just don't recommend reading it in public, because you WILL cry.
B007QPFGJW|2.0|The book was too slow with not enough plot to sustain it.  Characters were dull. Far cry from The Snowman which I found riveting.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|I picked this up since my Surface Pro only has a single USB 3.0 spot and I sometimes want to have a mouse as well as an ethernet port hooked up. This works for that purpose just fine, and I am still able to add in removable storage at the same time.<br /><br />My only complaint (and I have heard this is an issue with USB3 hubs) is that I can not use my 2.4ghz wireless mouse. It will jump all over the place and is a challenge to select icons.<br /><br />I will continue to buy Anker products, they are inexpensive yet function fully.
0375751513|4.0|Every description Oscar Wilde gives involves &#34;heaviness&#34; and that which is heavily scented.  That's a minor criticism.  It would be nice to have a bit more variety.  Other than that, great entertainment.  Don't read this if you get disturbed by lots of descriptions of a man's physical appearance as that's the whole substance of the book.
B00E3IZIM0|4.0|I did enjoy this movie, but it truly requires you to ignore things like gravity, and common sense. If you can get past those things then you'll enjoy it, too.<br /><br />I have not purchased this blu-ray and have never seen this film on blu-ray. However, I did see the film in theaters and thought that it had its ups and downs. It's very similar to just about any anime that you've ever seen with mechs. Evangelion was the first to come to mind. I'm a fan of anime and have watched a number of series that are about mechs. They're entertaining and often stretch your imagination a bit. I walked into the theater with the knowledge that this (my interpretation) was likely an anime made into a movie with real people to appeal to a broader audience. I wasn't disappointed on this front. This movie is mechtastic. However, I feel like Del Toro missed something when he decided on how the mechs would battle (Semi Spoiler: there was a convenient scene that you'll wonder why something that would have been extremely useful during an entire battle wasn't used until the end). Things like this are what made me rate this a 3 star film. It's good, and I would happily watch it again, but IMO it's not worth $30 and it's not a great film that I'll be pondering for days, or going out of my way to rent/buy. I would consider paying $20 for it, but I wouldn't truly be interested until it dropped below that. Overall, it might be really cool in the home theater surround sound 3D experience, but these inconsistencies and convenient plot maneuvers make it feel more like anime lite. It's not the real thing, but it will do until something better comes along. I would certainly consider renting it from Redbox or Netflix if they had 3D films and will probably rent the 2D one anyways, but again, purchasing it for $30 seems bit steep. This is especially true when considering that I would probably only watch it a few times, and possibly use it to showcase my 3D and surround sound.. It's enjoyable and appeals to the younger more destructive kid in a lot of people, but it's not a movie that you want to look at too critically.<br /><br />Update: 10/21/13<br />After reading multiple reviews of the 3D blu-ray on multiple websites I decided to go against my better judgement and see if this movie was really as good as people said on blu-ray. The fact that I heard that this movie makes great use of rear surrounds and I had just purchased a new set was the deciding factor. First off, I owe an apology to anybody that did not purchase this movie on my account. If you have an HD/3D TV and/or a 5.1 - 7.1 sound system that can hold its own, then this movie is worth the money. In other words, the plot is still a bit cookie cutter and doesn't do a lot to surprise you, but it is a movie that is aware of what it wants to be, and really shines if that's what you're looking for. The picture, sound, and 3D quality are top notch. If you want to test the LFE on your subwoofer and see how well your sound system holds up then not 5 minutes into this movie you might be getting calls from your neighbors about the sound. The 3D is amazing. Simply put, it's very difficult to believe that it wasn't filmed using 3D cameras. The underwater, snow, and rain scenes are amazing and the sound effects make it feel like you're really there with very minimal, and very forgivable ghosting every now and then. I would strongly recommend this movie to someone that has a 3D TV and a capable surround sound system, but would be reluctant to do so without both. The 2D picture is amazing and someone with an HD TV (sans surround sound) would probably enjoy it, but they would be missing out on a lot of what this film has to offer. If you are in this group, then I would suggest renting it to make up your mind. It's a good movie if you are looking for something that looks beautiful, sounds great, and provides a real good vs evil beat 'em up style to it. However, if you are hoping for more depth to the story than that..Well, you best just keep searching. This is a good movie with great visuals and sound. I upped my rating one more star due to these factors. I know that many owners of 3D TVs will purchase a movie solely for the picture, so if you're in that bucket then do yourself a favor and press the buy now button. This movie is up there with Avatar so far as the 3D goes. Again, I apologize to any readers that disregarded this film after reading my initial review. Hopefully this followup helps you out in your decision.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Very suspensful with twists and turns galore.  Loved the main characters.  Surprise ending so don't read ahead.  I thought I had it all figured out but I didn't
B009RX85N0|5.0|I really enjoy this show. It gets better and better with each show.  I am always wondering what new character they'll come up with next.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Wow, is all I can say.  I loved this book.  The characters were like old friends.  I couldn't put this book down.  Read it in 2 days.  I thought it would make a terrific film and it will be!!  Have recommended it to several friends who also loved it.  The ending is not what you expect so don't read ahead.

B006AZZPCM|4.0|Great app!!!  Love it..<br />Reason for the 4 stars is the pop up ads!!  Hate them and that's my only complaint
1594203334|5.0|While I was in Paris, I made same observations - children playing happily amongst themselves in the park and the mothers were calmly having conversations with each other. There was a definite &#34;kid&#34; world and &#34;parent&#34; world. This is similar to how things were when i was raised - I have always wondered why .in today's culture parents are slaves to these horribly behaved demanding children...She answers this question ....several times over in this book...plus it clearly works.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|How do you create such a creative game with so much detail I don't know but this game is just to fun
B00F87A7HG|5.0|Very good album by Kings Of Leon. All the songs are awesome. Want good tunes, get this album! you won't regret it.

B0015DROBO|3.0|hard to get into reading but very good ending, must read the entire series to get the full thrill of the book
B008K5T5AI|5.0|I enjoyed Hydrogen Sonata very much.  I remember discovering Consider Phlebas in hard cover on the new arrivals shelf at my local library all those years ago, borrowing it and greeting my first taste of the Culture.<br /><br />At that point in time The Culture existed in in just a single space-novel, but as that novel reached its cataclysmic conclusion, I wanted to know more about it.  I've since read each of the short stories and novels about The Culture as the were published, and have never been disappointed with where Banks took me as reader - it was always engrossing and entertaining.<br /><br />Hydrogen Sonata again adds some new twists to the theme and creates entirely new characters, while building further on the relationship between the ship Minds and the (almost) human citizens of Galactic civilisation.  It was kind of sad knowing that this would be the last instalment, but like the end of the story, te is a rich tapestry to revisit at leisure.<br /><br />Reading Hydrogen Sonata on Kindle  &#34;glass&#34;, in my case running on an iPad, is also a cause to reflect on the difference between the first and last Culture story.  Everything has changed, but so much remains the same!<br /><br />As a finall aside, I did read a couple of Banks' crime novels, and while they were mildly enjoyable, I just couldn't get into them........ so to me his finest and most enuring work is his body of Science Fiction stories, both Culture and other.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Amazing doesn't even begin to describe this series. Phenomenal story. Could not put it down. Author did an amazing job really painting a visual picture for the more visual learner. Loved it!
B00AFEXRME|5.0|I chose to purchase this film and add it to my film library, because Denzel Washington is one of my favorite character actors.  The premise of the film (air flight disaster) seemed to come straight from the front page of the newspaper.  Also, as a recovering alcoholic, I found Denzel's portrayal of a somewhat tormented soul to be inspiring.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Phenomenal story. Could not put it down. Author did an amazing job really painting a visual picture for the more visual learner. Loved it!
B0035XVVDY|5.0|I accidentally &#34;picked this film up&#34; on one of my cable channels.  I watched it at least six times and then decided to purchase it and make it an addition to my DVD library.  I thought that all of the major characters were well described and I especially believe that Jamie Foxx did an outstanding job as the Assistant District Attorney who would not give up the case despite overwhelming odds.

B005LAIIN0|3.0|Seriously.  Every time you turn around he is running again.  Also, having read the book was somewhat disappointed that the only thing the book and the movie share is the title.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is a fun game that includes a good movie for the family and children. i love the movie it is funny
B00321GTJU|1.0|All they focus on is animals killing animals for the storyline. There's much more to earth than carnage, I.e., physics of nature and natural settings, symbiotic relationships between animals, biological life and it's interaction and adaption to different ecosystems, etc. They missed an opportunity to tell a complete and fascinating story by only focusing on the &#34;competitive survival&#34; of life.
B00ACKU1NY|5.0|Most of channels are quite good.<br />Very very reliable!!!!!<br />Some channels need to be fix because they stop displaying regularly.
B00AFZ86C4|5.0|Been looking for this album for awhile, then hit it lucky. listen to parts of these albums almost every day while on the road, brings back some good memories.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Another wonderful book by Kate Morton.  I have read all her books and they are the best stories I have read in a long time!  Can't wait till she writes another book!  Loved them all and this one was the best.  I recommend it to all readers who love stories about England.  From Australia to England it was wonderful.  You never know how the story will end until the last minute.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|Love the Marvel movies they are so exciting. Can't wait for the next one to come out. I love how all the movies tie together
B0040HO01Y|4.0|Enjoying this series.  If you're a fan of British period dramas, you will enjoy it.  Better than 90% of daily TV programming available on basic cable.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Very funny,It is truly a family movie,Laughs and more laughs.It is one of my girls favorite movies.like it like it
B00846REIS|5.0|Where do I even begin?  This whole Series was amazing!  Can I just say love Gideon. Sylvia did a GREAT job with this story line. Can't wait for the next book.
B008Y212PI|3.0|Good for a free game but not too challenging and does not increase in difficulty as you work through the different screens.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun entertaining I like this because when I am board I can just play this game I recommend this game
B003XWEQ1G|4.0|Being an unabashed fan of Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe (the latter's turn in Les Mis notwithstanding), this comes from an admittedly slanted point of view.  That said, for relating a great yarn, with terrific supporting performances and dialogue, this Robin is a stand-out and should not be missed.  A further bonus is that Kate Blanchet is utterly credible and perfectly cast as \\"Maid\\" Marian, underplaying her role without a hint of self-consciousness.  Enthusiastically recommended.
B004CAWSKE|5.0|Delane really knows how to rock. The lead singer has a beautiful voice. This band isn't afraid to get heavy either, and really rocks out choruses and breakdowns. I'm new to this band...will definitely have to pick up more of their music. Puts me a bit in mind of Sirenia but without the awful male death metal vocals - well, with the exception of Track 6.
B000002TLX|5.0|Great CD. I absolutely love Richard Marx. This is definitely a good collection of his greatest hits. Would recommend it to any fan.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Pretty good game. Could use a better tutorial. Game play seems pretty fast so far. Very easy to spend way too much time playing it.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The acting, writing and production of this show are outstanding.  I started from episode one and have been captivated. It not only stimulates my mind but also touches my heart.  The characters and acting is exceptional.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Follett has done it again. He brings history to life through the creation of characters representing all social strata. His characters are engaging and keep the reader wanting to know more.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|I loved this story! I am a huge Castle fan and I noticed so many similarities between different episodes and these novels. The ghost writer did a phenomenal job! Can't wait to read the next book!
B008D28HYS|5.0|I had never tried one of these types of puzzles before.  I'm so addicted now.  It's challenging and logical and great for exercising your problem solving skills.  If you are a Sudoku fan you'll like it.  If you like jigsaw puzzles I think you would too.  I wish I had a bigger tablet than my 7\\" Kindle, but the zoom/scroll features are there and you'll need them as the grids get bigger.  Also love the colors.  I got it as a FAOTD and I'm am super glad I did.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Great movie. Really brought the history to life with great acting and sets. A great political story which in some ways shows why our government seems so dysfunctional at times. The issues at stake here where historical, but many times they are not.
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|Pretty cute family movie. Very colorful and visually stimulating. It made me laugh a few times too. I'd watch again.
B005ZB91KY|5.0|Great movie! Recommended for all ages! THIS is the hero that started it all for Marvel comics. It was nice to see the sequel of the Avemgers
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I liked the novel but did not like the ending. I do not want to give it away for others so will not comment further.
B007ZXK08C|1.0|I didn't like the book at all only got to read a few chapters and deleted it too pages about nothing.
B00C8985DU|4.0|The album and its sound are exceptional.  The bonus is all the included books and information.  Macca was really the only visible Beatle after the break-up, maybe the other were worn out, and he cemented his reputation with this release.
B004H4XAXO|5.0|Finally, a good Modern Fantasy.  Brandon Sanderson sets a new standard for Fantasy Novels. Want to read more and anxiously waiting for the other sequels, hope Sanderson meets the standard he has set himself.<br /><br />Enjoy it :-)
0345529057|4.0|The book takes you deeper into this fantasy world that you know from the series. I recommend you just plonge into it.
B006S08RLU|5.0|Witty, clever film with great cinematography.  This film really celebrates all the little joys of life.  It will make you smile =]
B00C7DGQ9C|3.0|Appealing to tweens and maybe young teens seeking gore...most other folks would find it boring with a very different story line between the original story and this Hollywood version.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Turned on to Reacher from the movie. Enjoyed this book. Looking forward to reading more of these books. Love me
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|..with it's awesome graphics and game play. Not to mention, it's free--at least for the basic stuff. It does have some technical issues like quitting mid-play and taking a while to download, which is why I gave it 3 stars.
B00BRUQ3PS|4.0|. Admittedly when you get everything wrapped up in a trilogy, you do bemoan that this book wasn't as good as the first two. But still I love the characters and story that Atwood creates so I was happy.
B000SEH80I|5.0|This book along with private therapy has helped me learn how to deal with my insanely dysfunctional family.  I have also learned to not blame myself for having a terrible childhood.  It is very freeing to overcome these lifelong battles.
B00BMKH5NW|4.0|...but this was a great book. Few characters, but compelling and believable. I could hardly put the book down. I loved her other book, Eleanor and Park, also.
B00FFHG6KQ|5.0|My son loves this game.  He loves all the info about each player.  It is easy to play.  It also updates player information when trades happen or something else changes.
B003B02PF4|5.0|I loved this book, couldn't put it down, I like John Grisham's book. I think his books hold your attention.
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|The book is a bit like a soap opera. It leaves nothing to the imagination of the reader. I finished it only because I thought it might have some value at the end. It didn't.
B00ECTZKJ6|4.0|Ok. I just want to say that I am a Korn fan and I am not blinded because of that to say that this album is not the best ever. Dont get me wrong..I really liked the album..mostly. I love 3 songs for sure-Love and Meth..is my favorite. A couple of them I just need to fast forward through. The guitars are awesome!! and that is what I have been hoping and waiting for. Head and Munky really got something solid going on this record. I am though getting alittle tired of some of the \\"same old same old\\" in the lyrics department. I really like Jonathan's voice but the lyrics just sound depressing and the same on each song.I understand he was going through alot at the time and I am soooo glad he is ok.But it does get alittle tiresome at times.That said this is a great \\"comeback\\" record with Head on board!

B0016YBFZ8|5.0|One of Scorsese's best mob movies! Don't F with the Cicero crime family.  I still remember watching this in the theater and finding out I shared the same surname as the screen version crime family.  A wild ride of a movie that mixes the highs and the lows of being a mobster.  The soundtrack adds greatly to the enjoyment.  Hard to hear the tail end of Layla and not picture all the mob hits.  A very good movie if you're not offended by F-bombs.

B00AEFXUL2|4.0|This movie was a remake of Rio Bravo where Dean Martin played a deputy who buried his fractured heart and pain in<br />alcohol. Here Robert Mitchum was the sheriff who had the same problem with women and solved his cracked heart in<br />much the same way. Two old pros helping 3 new talents get their break.<br /><br />I have enjoyed these two films for years.
B00BEIYP8A|5.0|Rush, the newest film from director Ron Howard, who directed A Beautiful Mind and Frost/Nixon, certainly lives up to its name. The film follows two Formula One race car drivers in the 1970s--two men who hurtle around racetracks at 170 miles per hour in what one character calls \\"coffins on wheels\\".<br /><br />James Hunt and Niki Lauda both leave their families' businesses behind in order to take a shot at the one thing they are good at--racing--but the similarities between the two end there. Hunt, played by Chris Hemsworth whom you may know as Thor in The Avengers, is a Brit with plenty of charm and a penchant for women and weed, and relies on guts and daring to win each race. Lauda, played by a Spanish-born German actor named Daniel Brühl who will soon be seen in The Fifth Estate with Benedict Cumberbatch, is an abrasive perfectionist from Germany who relies on mechanical precision and intense preparation on his road to success. The two are rivals from their very first race on a Formula Three circuit in England, when both of their cars spin out of control and Hunt pulls a risky stunt to win the race. Their differing personalities and methods clash on and off the racetrack, and what follows is an intense rivalry as Hunt and Lauda ascend the ranks and make it to Formula One, and then face off against each other for the world championship title.<br /><br />The 1970s were a very dangerous time for Formula One drivers, and there were many casualties. The threat of death looms large over both Hunt and Lauda, though they deal with it in very different ways. The swaggering, reckless Hunt throws up before most races, and the calculating Lauda declares that he will not go over a 20 percent risk of dying. The danger, and Hunt and Lauda's obsessive rivalry, comes to a head during the 1976 racing season, which changes the way they drive and view the world.<br /><br />What I liked most about this film was the character development. The joint biopic of Hunt and Lauda does not shyaway from the flaws found in both men. Hunt is a self-absorbed womanizer who races during the day and parties all night. Lauda is a cold, abrasive man who is not afraid to make enemies as he climbs to the top of his sport. Hunt, who almost oozes charm and literally has a girl out of her pants within five minutes of the movie, is the kind of guy that American audiences have been trained to root for--think James Kirk, James Bond, etc. But this film shows the dark side of the wise-cracking, charismatic hero. We see Hunt at his very lowest point, when he has lost his car and sponsor, gets drunk, and verbally abuses his wife. While Lauda has absolutely no charisma whatsoever, he assumes the heroic mantle in the second half of the film, as he provides a moral center.<br />Both men, at the end of the film, have learned from each other. Hunt learns about grit, determination, and loyalty, and Lauda understands the importance of passion both on and off the racetrack. As opposites they push each other to succeed and go to heights they never would have achieved on their own.<br /><br />I loved this movie. It was compelling, gripping, and, well, a total rush. But what I loved most about the film, thrills aside, was the way it made me think about heroism. I left the theater thinking about what our culture values in heroes today, and about the things that make people truly heroic. We see Hunt and Lauda struggle, fail, and fall, and see all of their flaws on display. We see the low points of the character we would usually assume is the hero, and the quiet triumph off the track of the character we would usually love to hate. The acting, directing, and cinematography are top notch, but it is the characterization, and the questions that arise because of it, that make this film a true champion.
B003AXAS60|1.0|it is not a 8 inches long toy. it is only 5 inches!!! too small toy. It made me shy because I ordered it for my niece and she does not like this tiny toy :\

B004SOR4H6|3.0|This is a great app, but since the latest update, My kindle reads &quot;Twitter has stopped&quot; every time I try to log in. I hope this issue gets fixed really soon.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I've been a fan since the syndication runs of the 70's and always liked the original crew.  JJ Abrams pulled off something very hard to do.  If this was a rock band, he essentially did the equivalent of replacing all of the members of the band.  Success was helped by casting excellent actors and keeping the story moving at a fast pace.  Somehow with the rapid forward movement, character development has some time to ferment but not enough for the supporting cast because of time limitations.  The 2nd foray with this crew is a twist on a original series story and for me it works.  There's gravity around the actions of the characters and touching emotional performances by Pine and Quinto.<br /><br />I would say that Roddenberry would not have approved of this film however.  He was against the militarization of Star Trek and wanted to focus on social issues.  I have to say, I'm glad JJ Abrams stuck to his own vision and gave is this exciting &#34;A&#34; grade film.

B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|Korn is like moonshine to me, a remedy when nothing else commercially available will suffice.  Their eleventh album The Paradigm Shift ranks among their most potent and volatile concoctions yet.  That's saying something when you consider the Grammy award-winning band is approaching twenty years in the industry.  It's all because of the return of their beloved co-founding guitarist Brian \\"Head\\" Welch, whose unique method of creating a hybrid guitar presence with his band mate Munky has long ago passed the point of legend.  Yet it also has a lot to do with the renewed vigor and friendly professional disposition of Ray Luzier, their drummer now since their ninth album Korn III: Remember Who You Are.<br /><br />The results are a regained focus and passion fans have been craving for some time now, ten years in fact if you measure from the last album featuring Head, 2003's Take A Look In The Mirror.  The first track, \\"Prey For Me\\", I must ask, how is it this lead-in track manages to leap out of the proverbial box recycling a few familiar old riffs before reaching for transcendence in the counterpoint chorus and final half? I don't know, but that's exactly what it manages to do, with the resounding finality they built their foundation upon. Fieldy's click bass is back in place and everyone just coheres together for an astounding opening track.<br /><br />\\"Goodbye, so long, wish I could stay but everything is all wrong,\\" sings Jonathan during a brief interlude which manages to nail the psycho-emotional tone of not merely the whole album, but the entire band's legacy itself.  \\"Passion is sometimes a phukt up thing for me,\\" Jon sings straight up, cutting through the usual sort of dressy lyrics most bands opt for. You know what you can all do with that sort of predictable poetry.<br /><br />Throughout the album, Jon packs in a ton of emotional detail into his bared raw lyrics, really connecting him again with that dark muse that helped the band shake the music world twenty years ago.  I both LOL'd and kinda cried a little bit at two different points during \\"Prey For Me\\"--then found myself doing so simultaneously as the realization swept over me, towards the end of the song, that our boys from Bakersfield had actually pulled their original groundbreaking sound back out of their magical bag of tricks.<br /><br />Obviously reinvigorated by the band's reunion with their long lost brother Head, Jon's unique brand of sardonic honesty has regained full confidence, and the chemistry between all members of the band reignites that sense of urgency which had, in recent years, given way to other sorts of experimentation.  It turns out all the excitement about The Paradigm Shift is not hype.<br /><br />Track two \\"Love and Meth\\" (alluding to both Head's other band \\"Love and Death\\" as well as a nod to the guitarist's former methamphetamine abuse) notches up the intensity with Jonathan sounding as if he's pushing his vocals past their limit when he roars out \\"Where do I run, where do I hide, give me a reason to end my life / Where do I run, where do I hide, give me a reason to get out alive,\\"  and Ray Luzier's excellent drumming skills are finally allowed to reach their full potential; his drum fills are whip-smart perfect.  This song was the second single released online, the antidote to Never Never, and its uncanny resemblance to a Love and Death song should be considered as ample evidence enough that Brian's ideas have been welcomed back into the fold.<br /><br />By the time the 3rd track hits, \\"What We Do\\", a wide smile has plastered itself across my face.  The song features a fast tempo and driving beat and a new vocal style from Jon which I really enjoy listening to.  It is precisely where the album shifts into higher gear, you can hear the elevation during the intro.  It builds into something pretty special for the band's legion of fans, speaking for myself as a lifelong appreciator of the usual \\"thinking man's\\" bands (from the original Pink Floyd on through Bowie, Eno, Jethro Tull, Rush, King Crimson, to name a few), now I can honestly add Korn without flinching to this list, so it's a good thing the song segues nicely into track four, \\"Spike in My Veins.\\"  This track is unbelievably good, the thing you could only dream of when considering possibilities of another song having as much appeal as A.D.I.D.A.S. or Good God, for instance.  Therefore it was this track at which I once again became a tad verklempt while hearing it for the first time, feeling my emotions surge up into my chest, for us fans and the guys in the band.  It is definitely one of the album's high points, signaling the band's evolved sound.  I almost couldn't believe what I was hearing.<br /><br />Then \\"Mass Hysteria\\" begins.  What can I say?  Never once looking back, Jon sings \\"We ride a dying star / across a burning sea / we're like a supernova now / MASS HYSTERIA!\\"  while Head and Munky's creeped-out, wavery guitar tones help push the envelope even further than before:  a bonafide futurist epic anthem unlike anything the band's done, and partly inspired by Dio, as Jonathan recently admitted in an interview.  How cool is that. By this point in the album's narrative, it has become abundantly clear that the real Korn are back in the saddle and making no compromises.<br /><br />Track six \\"Paranoid and Aroused\\" starts with some heavy pounding riffs courtesy of the 2-Headed Monster, and Jon sings about demons creeping around, angels pulling him into the ground, and generally belts out more classic Korn angst for the masses of disenfranchised teenagers out there.  Like all the songs on The Paradigm Shift, it boasts its own unique style, while retaining that classic signature Korn sound.<br /><br />Throughout the album the lyrics are diverse and interesting enough to yield different meanings for those listening intently trying to interpret what Jon is singing.  As a die hard myself I've always appreciated Jon's decision not to ever print the lyrics in the liner notes, because he doesn't want us distracted from paying attention to the music itself.  Eventually most of the lyrics are figured out by a consensus of fans.  Jon stated anyhow that if we can't understand what he's saying, he's probably not saying anything at all.  To this day I consider that a true ethic, and I gotta give a Shout Out of gratitude to my brother Jon for keeping it real and not printing the lyrics.<br /><br />This is music to drive sane people insane and insane people back to sanity--either way, it's a win-win.  Another thing:  this album is the most metal sounding Korn has ever made.  Die hards will take note that the main album features eleven tracks, while the Special Edition's two bonus songs add up to a grand total of thirteen; all killer and no filler.  Also duly noted are the relatively short lengths of all the songs, with the longest not breaking past the five minute mark.  (It turns out fans may rest easy knowing the Special Edition trumps the regular edition due to the fact that not only are the two bonus songs excellent, but in particular, the final track \\"Tell Me What You Want\\" serves just as well as \\"It's All Wrong\\" does for an album closer.)<br /><br />Track seven, \\"Never Never,\\" is the eye around which the rest of the album furiously storms.  As the first single off The Paradigm Shift, it serves as the perfect commercial break from the rest of the album's hard-hitting tracks. I love that it's an anti-love song on the radio airwaves.  We could use more alternative, unsentimental perspectives such as this bittersweet offering for the radio.<br /><br />Then the eighth song, \\"Punishment Time,\\" begins; one of my favorites.  Jon's lyrics and voice once again reach for a higher level of melody with lines sung sweetly  as \\"I'm walking on a razor blade, careful not to cross the line, every little step I take, it's punishment time now\\" and \\"I'm hanging like a bat today, crucified by design, every little move I make, it's punishment time now\\" while the rest of the band pummels the listener with relentless precision.  It's the way that Jon sings these lines, extremely melodic and sweet sounding (a great counterpoint to what the lines are saying) which is part of this band's raison d'être; that the vocals and lyrics are as much an organic part of the whole as any other instrument.  This is another reason the lyrics aren't printed; it would distract fans from actually listening for what the singer is trying to say.<br /><br />Then comes the moment we were waiting for, \\"Lullaby for a Sadist\\".  Oh my, what have we here,  a real bonafide Korn anthem?  Well wump, here it is.  A brooding and haunting song which transmogrifies into a truly disturbed exercise in masochistic mind play, \\"Lullaby For A Sadist\\" is a prime example of the sort of song only Jonathan Davis and Korn could come up with.  \\"This isn't a game, your life I'll swallow\\" croons Jonathan as dark undertones burgeon with implications tracing back to Life Is Peachy era.  With its nursery rhyme counting and wholly inappropriate for the mainstream sentiments, \\"Lullaby for a Sadist\\" delivers on all counts,  rendering another signature tune for the band to scare away yet another generation of concerned parents with.  Bravo, and well-played, Sirs.<br /><br />Which brings us to the tenth track, \\"Victimized.\\"  Here is more surprising ear candy which really merges the electronic elements with the driving force of the band's double-guitar, bass and drum attack.  I was riveted to the speakers listening to it for the first time; but on repeat listens, it has eased down a notch for me as a song.  There are nihilistic lyrics throughout the album, and this song is no exception; certain lines are too dark, even for me.  For example, when Jon sings \\"This life means nothing to me,\\" I just can't get on board. The song is a depressive work of nihilism that certain teenage mindsets will lap up.<br /><br />\\"It's All Wrong\\", the eleventh and final track for the regular edition, succeeds in pounding its way to our ears as an appropriate ending to a short, sharp, shock of an album.  It's the bookend companion to the first song.  \\"It's all wrong, knowing that my demon won, I'm done!\\" croons our front man leaving us all wondering whether he exorcised his devils or not.  There are a lot of textures and sounds here, with a core melody reminiscent of their old single \\"Somebody, Someone\\" from their senior effort iSsuEs.  I appreciate the old borrowed riffs and nods to songs of yore that appear here and there throughout the album, because they do so all too briefly, and serve as more braided rope with which to tie together all the revisited themes interwoven throughout their whole discography.<br /><br />After hearing The Paradigm Shift seven times, once on vinyl and the last few times on headphones from the CD ripped to my nano, I can cite six of their past albums which most crop up in the new album, and they would be their debut, FTL, iSsuEs, Untouchables, TALITM, and TPOT.  I'll probably uncover more such Easter eggs as I listen further, another indication we are talking about a modern masterpiece.<br /><br />The first of the two bonus tracks, \\"Wish I Wasn't Born Today\\" brings the band forward to a fresher approach, delivering an excellent extra track for fans who reached into their pockets a bit deeper for the Special Edition.  I think Jon's singing on the chorus here is exceptional, there's a lot of nuance to his enunciation and delivery.  It has a fresh feel which makes it perfect for the penultimate track.<br /><br />The album closes with the second bonus song \\"Tell Me What You Want,\\" what I took to be a subtle allusion to another old single of theirs, \\"Y'all Want A Single,\\" from the very album Head was last heard upon, Take A Look In The Mirror.  This song satisfies on a variety of levels, at once rollicking and insistent yet also a clever pronouncement which seems to purge the band's penchant since Brian's departure tocater to the fan's every wish and desire; the force and finality with which the words \\"Tell me what you want, tell me what you want / phuk You, Go Away / And Never Come Back!\\" are sung exemplifies what most of the old school fans have for so long secretly desired, which is for the band to give the polite middle-finger to the seething masses of clamoring fans insofar as what sort of albums they are supposed to create.  Finally, after a decade of trying to please everybody, it comes with a sense of blessed relief that they have apparently chosen to put together an album they made to please themselves.  And that is the way it should be, if you consider the fact nobody even knew of their existence prior to the release of their debut album.  That is an underlying reason why I think this album is so exceptional, and may quickly advance to the coveted position of their greatest achievement.<br /><br />In conclusion, and for all the reasons I've covered in this review, Korn is back with a vengeance on their eleventh studio album The Paradigm Shift.  With the renewed vitality in both their guitarists as well as their revamped rhythm section, it's a no brainer that Korn are here to stay for another decade of experimental albums, at least.  And that, as Martha Stewart would say, is a very good thing.<br /><br />Special Edition: Extra Bonus Notes<br /><br />  Hearing it on an iPod with headphones brings out the densely layered textures, not merely of the decent production values and mostly well-placed electronic effects, but also the intricacy of Head and Munky's guitar riffs.<br /><br />For anyone paying attention, it's more than obvious that there are few moments in which either Head or Munky really shine separately; this is for all purposes and values a true hybrid guitar presence comprised of two guitarists whose efforts, through various methods,  merge into a greater whole.  They don't just always take turns; they literally craft a kind of stereo-opticon sound which can be described more accurately perhaps as the band having one guitarist, the 2-Headed Monster.<br /><br />Let's not forget Ray Luzier's stunning contribution.  He is a drummer whose proficiency at hard rock percussion has finally been given free reign on this album, as all the fans have been hoping for.  Ray truly delivers a furious hard hitting style of drumming that has adapted perfectly to keep the Korn ship floating along breaking rapid white waters.  All the fans are stoked to have him on board, and by this, his third album with Korn, it really feels as if he's come home to roost for good.<br /><br />This album's thirteen tracks are chock full of that old 2-Headed monster chuggariffic sound which is the closest to metal they ever really got.  Not that it matters; what Korn do is their own thing, and that's where they shine best.  Fieldy's bass has significantly rediscovered its focus on this album.  Everything he does is balanced just right, nothing is overdone.  I've got to give him kudos for that, he really delivers throughout the whole album.<br /><br />If one were to fairly judge the metallic resonance of what Korn has achieved in relation to the world of rock'n'roll and metal music, I would suggest their eleventh studio effort is the very spot in their catalog where they've managed to successfully reconstruct that bridge of pioneering sound they can honestly call their own.<br /><br />If this is what is meant by the dreadful label numetal, then so be it; for it is truly a form of new metal, after all, and worthy of headbanging to.  Yet it remains most unfortunate for die hards world wide that instead, the dread numetal tag refers to the host of copycats spawned by this Bakersfield band, and whose ringing sound is better captured by the clarion call of someone like Disturbed, and perhaps crowned by the leaders of that charge, Slipknot.  This is not meant to suggest these bands are bad; there are a lot of exceptional numetal bands, and it all boils down to a matter of individual taste.  Everyone from Limp Bizkit to System Of A Down jumped on the numetal bandwagon, but it's important to note that the California band which kick-started this movement has remained exclusively outside of it, focusing their efforts on carving out their own particular niche in the hard rock sounds-cape.<br /><br />So here they are, nineteen years later, with the proof in the pudding on their eleventh album.  So let me take this moment to thank Brian \\"Head\\" Welch for looking into his heart and seeing that his brothers and family in Korn were worth returning to.  Thanks Jon and Munky and Fieldy and Ray for accepting Head back into the fold.  And thanks to all the \\"fans uv korn\\" for supporting this legendary band.  Once again it's time to rock. \m/\m/he regular edition, succeeds in pounding its way to our ears as an appropriate ending to a short, sharp, shock of an album.

This song satisfies on a variety of levels, at once rollicking and insistent yet also a clever pronouncement which seems to purge the band's penchant since Brian's departure tocater to the fan's every wish and desire; the force and finality with which the words \\"Tell me what you want, tell me what you want / phuk You, Go Away / And Never Come Back!\\" are sung exemplifies what most of the old school fans have for so long secretly desired, which is for the band to give the polite middle-finger to the seething masses of clamoring fans insofar as what sort of albums they are supposed to create.  Finally, after a decade of trying to please everybody, it comes with a sense of blessed relief that they have apparently chosen to put together an album they made to please themselves.  And that is the way it should be, if you consider the fact nobody even knew of their existence prior to the release of their debut album.  That is an underlying reason why I think this album is so exceptional, and may quickly advance to the coveted position of their greatest achievement.<br /><br />In conclusion, and for all the reasons I've covered in this review, Korn is back with a vengeance on their eleventh studio album The Paradigm Shift.  With the renewed vitality in both their guitarists as well as their revamped rhythm section, it's a no brainer that Korn are here to stay for another decade of experimental albums, at least.  And that, as Martha Stewart would say, is a very good thing.<br /><br />Special Edition: Extra Bonus Notes<br /><br />  Hearing it on an iPod with headphones brings out the densely layered textures, not merely of the decent production values and mostly well-placed electronic effects, but also the intricacy of Head and Munky's guitar riffs.<br /><br />For anyone paying attention, it's more than obvious that there are few moments in which either Head or Munky really shine separately; this is for all purposes and values a true hybrid guitar presence comprised of two guitarists whose efforts, through various methods,  merge into a greater whole.  They don't just always take turns; they literally craft a kind of stereo-opticon sound which can bedescribed more accurately perhaps as the band having one guitarist, the 2-Headed Monster.<br /><br />Let's not forget Ray Luzier's stunning contribution.  He is a drummer whose proficiency at hard rock percussion has finally been given free reign on this album, as all the fans have been hoping for.  Ray truly delivers a furious hard hitting style of drumming that has adapted perfectly to keep the Korn ship floating along breaking rapid white waters.  All the fans are stoked to have him on board, and by this, his third album with Korn, it really feels as if he's come home to roost for good.<br /><br />This album's thirteen tracks are chock full of that old 2-Headed monster chuggariffic sound which is the closest to metal they ever really got.  Not that it matters; what Korn do is their own thing, and that's where they shine best.  Fieldy's bass has significantly rediscovered its focus on this album.  Everything he does is balanced just right, nothing is overdone.  I've got to give him kudos for that, he really delivers throughout the whole album.<br /><br />If one were to fairly judge the metallic resonance of what Korn has achieved in relation to the world of rock'n'roll and metal music, I would suggest their eleventh studio effort is the very spot in their catalog where they've managed to successfully reconstruct that bridge of pioneering sound they can honestly call their own.<br /><br />If this is what is meant by the dreadful label numetal, then so be it; for it is truly a form of new metal, after all, and worthy of headbanging to.  Yet it remains most unfortunate for die hards world wide that instead, the dread numetal tag refers to the host of copycats spawned by this Bakersfield band, and whose ringing sound is better captured by the clarion call of someone like Disturbed, and perhaps crowned by the leaders of that charge, Slipknot.  This is not meant to suggest these bands are bad; there are a lot of exceptional numetal bands, and it all boils down to a matter of individual taste.  Everyone from Limp Bizkit to System Of A Down jumped on the numetal bandwagon, but it's important to note that the California band which kick-started this movement has remained exclusively outside of it, focusing their efforts on carving out their own particular niche in the hard rock sounds-cape.<br /><br />So here they are, nineteen years later, with the proof in the pudding on their eleventh album.  So let me take this moment to thank Brian \\"Head\\" Welch for looking into his heart and seeing that his brothers and family in Korn were worth returning to.  Thanks Jon and Munky and Fieldy and Ray for accepting Head back into the fold.  And thanks to all the \\"fans uv korn\\" for supporting this legendary band.  Once again it's time to rock. \m/\m/

Connelly successfully combines suspense, horror, human nature, and the gritty realities of modern life.

B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|This is the extraordinary tale of a true heroine and her family assaulted and brutalized by the Taliban, who wanted to suppress Malala's voice in support of girls' education, and of Malala's parents' unflinching support and unshakeable love for their daughter in a society that prizes sons.<br /><br />This terrific book, narrated in the first person, is reminiscent of The Diary of Anna Frank by its perspective of youthful impressions, innocent hopefulness and ambitions; but it is a much better book written with the collaboration of a professional writer.<br />It is obvious that the fluid narrative, descriptive prose, crisp syntax and precise writing style are guided by the hand of Christina Lamb, OBE, the renowned British foreign correspondent and journalist, but the story belongs to Malala whose namesake is Malalai, the greatest heroine of Afghanistan; she is said to have rallied the Pashtun tribes against the British in the Battle of Maiwand, which resulted in an Afghan victory and her death, on 27 July 1880.<br /><br />Malala Yousafzai, was born in 1997 in Mingora, in the Swat Valley of North Eastern Pakistan. She was a \\"girl in a land where rifles are fired in celebration of a son, but daughters are hidden behind a curtain, their role in life simply to prepare food and give birth to children.\\" For most Pashtuns the birth of a daughter is a setback, but Ziauddin, Malala's father was pleased by her birth exclaiming, \\"I know there is something different about this child\\" and gave her the nickname of `Jani Mun' (soulmate) while her mother lovingly calls her `Pisho' (cat). Malala was raised by loving parents, in a society governed by immutable traditions based on conventional Sunni Islam, where the code of `Pashtunwali and nang' (Hospitality and Honor) is absolute. \\"Without honor the world counts for nothing.\\"<br /><br />The Prologue gives a brief history of the region, which was peaceful for the most part since independence from British rule, except for skirmishes among the various tribes and clans, usually triggered by land grabs or honor slights. The rights of females in the political arena, the workplace and, especially, in education were slowly being accepted and encouraged until the catastrophic advent of the Taliban. The latter imposed a retrogressive, reactionary, oppressive and perverted brand of Islam, which they enforced with brutality, terrorism and murder. They were particularly vicious to females whom they consider nothing more than chattel and banned them from formal education or work outside the home.<br />Many girls continued their education surreptitiously while hiding from the Taliban. Girls' schools had no identification and students would go there furtively.<br />In an interview, Malala said: \\"\\"I remember that there was a boy in our school who was asked by a journalist, `Why are the Taliban against education?' He answered very simply. By pointing to his book he said, `A Talib doesn't know what is written inside this book,'\\" he said. \\"They think that God is a tiny, little conservative being who would send girls to hell just because of going to school.\\"<br /><br />The Islamists targeted Malala and her father for their activism for women's rights. Malala, by age 11-12 was blogging in the western media on promoting women's education and the Taliban's tactics. She became an international spokesperson for her cause. When the Taliban overran the Swat Valley, the region was evacuated and its inhabitants displaced; Malala and her family became refugees. They returned home several months later after the Pakistani army ousted the Taliban, and Malala continued her advocacy in the local and international media. She was eventually awarded Pakistan's first \\"National Youth Peace Prize\\" in 2011, and in 2012 Malala was planning an Education Foundation to help poor girls get a formal education. In that same year the Taliban targeted her for murder.<br />On October 9, 2012 a Taliban assassin shot her in the face while she was riding the bus back home from school. The bullet penetrated over her left eye socket under the skin, shattered her left ear and facial nerve, went through her neck and lodged in her shoulder. Two other girls on the bus, were also wounded in the attack.<br />Malala was initially treated at the military hospital in Peshawar with a decompressive craniotomy to relieve the pressure on the brain, but developed sepsis and multiple organ failure. She was tranferred to a hospital in Rawalpindi where she treated by Dr. Fiona Reynolds, a British pediatric ICU specialist, (who happened to be visiting the area to advise on transplant surgery). Six days later, Malala, accompanied by Dr. Reynolds, was transfered (on the Emir of UAE's medical plane), to England where she was treated at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. After months of sophisticated treatment and complex reconstructive surgery, she miraculously recovered without any significant brain damage and is presently pursuing her advocacy campaign for women's education through conferences, newspaper and Internet articles, blogs, TV interviews and books.<br />The failed assassination attempt prompted worldwide condemnation and produced a torrent of sympathy and support for education. The Right to Education Bill was ratified in Pakistan and a bounty of 10 million rupees ($105,000) was placed on the Taliban assassins. Politicians and celebrities all over the world rose in support of Malala; in contrast, `Ehsanullah Ehsan' of the Taliban, who proudly claimed the group's responsibility for the attack, accused Malala, \\"as the symbol of the infidels and obscenity\\" accused her of \\"propagating against Islam and Islamic forces and should be killed\\" quoting the `Sharia' he added, \\"that a child can be killed if he is propagating against Islam\\" and \\"if she survives they will target her again!\\"  So much for barbarism! Their profound ignorance of Islam is breathtaking. In response to this outrage, 50 of Pakistan's major clerics have issued a \\"Fatwa\\" against the Taliban gunmen.<br />The plotters and gunmen were identified by the Pakistani authorities but remain at large, mostly \\"for lack of evidence?!\\"<br /><br />On her 16th birthday, Malala spoke to the United Nations Assembly on \\"Malala Day\\", her first public speech since the attack. She was conciliatory and forgiving to her attackers and continued to champion girls' education. One child's voice to inspire change in the world. She began her speech with \\"Thank you to God, for whom we are all equal.\\" and continued, \\"This is the compassion that I have learnt from Muhammad-the prophet of mercy, Jesus Christ and Lord Buddha.\\"<br />Malala has shone a light on the absence of women's rights in countries dominated by radical Islamists, on the bloodthirsty mindset of those who hate western ideas - such as education, freedom and universal rights. She is the living example of the indomitable courage of a real, modern-day hero and a global symbol for peaceful protest.<br /><br />Sadly, Malala has her critics, and the vermin have crawled out of the sewer, mainly in her homeland. Journalist Assed Baig described her as being used to justify Western imperialism as \\"the perfect candidate for the white man to relieve his burden and save the native. Some have accused her on social media of being a prostitute and a CIA spy and columnist Huma Yusuf wrote \\"Her fame highlights Pakistan's most negative aspect (rampant militancy); her education campaign echoes Western agendas; and the West's admiration of her is hypocritical because it overlooks the plight of other innocent victims, like the casualties of U.S. drone strikes.\\"<br />Truly one is not a prophet in one's land.<br /><br />Malala Yousafzai received many international awards and was recently nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize (the youngest person ever).The Norwegian Nobel Peace Prize selection Committee, overlooked Malala, in favor the politically correct flavor of the day, the Organization for the Prohibition chemical weapons (OPCW).<br />Malala, in this instance, is in good company; Mahatma Ghandi was denied the Peace Prize even after five nominations in 1937,38,39,47 and 48.<br />Malala does not need the Nobel Peace Prize, but the Prize needs Malala to justify its (fading) value and importance.<br />Even before the decision was announced, Tilman Brueck, head of the Stockholm Peace Research Institute told Norwegian news agency NTB that, \\"I'm not sure it would be suitable, from an ethical point of view, to give the peace prize to a child (Malala).\\" He obviously has not read the Bible where it unequivocally states, \\"The calf and the lion will graze together, and a little child will lead them.'(Issaiah 11:6)<br /><br />The book is dedicated \\"To all the girls who have faced injustice and been silenced. Together we will be heard.\\"<br />This terrific book and Malala's UN speech should be an inspiration to girls and women everywhere because \\"Education is the power for women\\" and totalitarian oppressive Islamists are fearful of this power that would negate their dominance.<br /><br />UPDATE : 10/10/2014, It was announced today that Malala Yousafzai was awarded the Nobel Prize for peace.ters and gunmen were identified by the Pakistani authorities but remain at large, mostly \\"for lack of evidence?!\\"    On her 16th birthday, Malala spoke to the United Nations Assembly on \\"Malala Day\\", her first public speech since the attack.

B00FFRAKRG|5.0|I have been a fan of Korn since the beginning.  A friend of mine let me borrow their first CD in college and I went out right away and got a copy for myself.  They were so new and different.  Their next few albums were just as good if not better.  In 2005 Head left the band and the difference was very noticeable.  The next few albums after that were just not what the band used to be.  This album marks the return of Head and Korn is now sounding like they used to.  If you have forgotten what you loved about Korn give this album a listen.  The best in a long time.

Recovering from a serious bout of mononucleosis, he is fettered by weakness and not the peak performer we've come to expect. In this story, AD has been invited to the home of an elderly priest for advice on an unspecified situation. Since the priest serves at a quiet, remote hospice for the dying and disabled, AD sees it as an agreeable place to convalesce.<br /><br />But when he arrives, he finds the priest has died, and there’s no clue to the problem for which he was summoned. AD decides take rest at the priest’s cottage and go through the books left to him in the old man’s will. Of course there’s no end of interruptions from nosy neighbors and hospital staffers, and mysteries posed by the institution’s director and patients. Soon AD is unwillingly embroiled in murders and conspiracies right and left.<br /><br />Through it all he persists in his intention to leave the Yard, but his curiosity and desire for justice propel him forward despite his infirmities. In the end, after all the wicked twists and turns, we’re still not sure he’ll return to his position. Obviously he does, because I'm currently reading #6 of the series!

B00171RQBW|5.0|Just after four years on the jazz-rock or R&B charts, Santana finally made their         complete return to their rock and roll roots for good in 1976 with this highly lauded         album that deeply impressed there fans and the press.  For Amigos, their seventh         album, their fans, as well as their old fans, who were glad to see them back in the         forefront of the rock elite, deeply embraced this ‘comeback hit’ as Carlos Santana         and the band delivered another blockbuster hit.  Backed with its defining track set         starting with Dance Sister Dance (Baila Mi Hermania), the fun concludes on other         classic hits like Take Me With You, Gitano, Europa (Earth’s Cry, Heaven’s Smile),         Let Me and the R&B-tinged Let It Shine, which result into an album that was more         dynamic at the time than Abraxis and Santana III that made this one of Santana’s         greatest and important works and it returned the band to it’s Top Ten status since         Welcome dazzled listeners back in 1973. With bandmate David Brown remaining         in the band that conquered Woodstock in 1969, Amigos took on it’s tighter, more         uptempo beat with a more vocal approach which replace the jazz-rock and prog-        rock sound with the stylings of R&B, funk and Mexican folk music that finally puts         a stop to there commercial slide. For a complete finishing touch, I would suggest         you rip a live take of Europa (Earth’s Cry Heaven’s Smile) from the Viva Santana         live compilation.  So with David Rubinson as producer, Amigos is a timeless gem         from The Santana Band, which will shine on forever within the ages as a defining         moment in the rock guitar mastermind’s rich spectacular legacy.

What does adds to the stirring phenomenal success of How          To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb is that it had reached Number One on the album          charts in 34 countries and the massive critical praise from the press, like Rolling          Stone and Q Magazine.

B0028IP68S|5.0|As Eric Clapton once again riding high on the charts in the 1980's, August, released          in 1986, maintains his return to the top during the decade which gives us another highly          successful CD from his commercial period from the mid-1980's.  On this album, he had          adopted a new, tougher and hard R&B approach where he gives the pulsating album a          more cutting edge beat while letting his guitar do plenty of the talking as the CD feature          back-up vocals by Tina Turner on several tracks, its slick horn section and the dynamic          Motown songwriting team of Lamont-Dozier-Holland.  Beginning with the excellent, but          contagious opening track The Way That You Use It (for which he co-wrote with Robbie          Robertson for master filmmaker Martin Scorsese' The Color Of Money, there sequel to          The Hustler from 1961 starring Paul Newman and Tom Cruise), which is proceeded on          other memorable tracks like Tearing Us Apart--his classic duet he did with Tine Turner,          Bad Influence and Take A Chance, which he sing and play fiercely that earned Clapton          AOR radioplay, which help gave August the gold record status it deserved.  By veering          between Phil Collins' soul pop and Clapton's blues-rock, this hot-shot classic reminded          us that as he enjoyed this commercial success from this period, he refused to give in to          the trappings of commercial influences by keeping his firm grip on his music career and          landmark artistry.  What also came directly from the August session are three outtakes          that were left out and needs to be included as soon as possible, as they include Wanna          Make Love To You, Lady Of Verona and Walking The White Line, which could serve as          the long-awaited finishing touch for this ebullient masterwork.

B000T1GPVI|5.0|His stay with Blue Note Records from 1947 to 1954 was essential, but would be no<br />  less achieved and magisterial as his first recordings as both solo leader and jazz star<br />  With his second album Genius Of Modern Music, Volume Two; released in 1952 just<br />  two years in the making; he heads a brilliant band line-up which features vibraphone<br />  master Milt Jackson, rising young tenor saxophonist Lou Donaldson, Art Blakey, and<br />  rising young drummer Max Roach, as they make the music shout with absolute vigor<br />  and gives it a soaring note.  Starting on with opening number Four In One, for which<br />  Monk well-showcases a bop into that leads into a bizarre repeated `five-against-two'<br />  quintet sequences, the track set proceed extremely well on early reinditions of Criss<br />  Cross, Ask Me Now, Skippy and there rousing second take on Straight, No Chaser,<br />  while several standards like Willow Weep For Me, Carolina Moon, and there second<br />  take on Nice Work If You Can Get It again gets a brilliant majestic touch from Monk.<br />  Genius Of Modern Music, Volume Two fully resumes his groundbreaking reputation<br />  as one of the greatest and most influential jazz pianists- composers of all time.  Just<br />  like the first volume from 1948, this one feature some refreshing alternate takes and<br />  Milt adds to his magical and enchanting solos as Monk and his band help make this<br />  masterwork just another important must in Monk's rich timeless legacy.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|I have been waiting so long for this to come out in the west on blue ray. I had a DVD, but the only blu ray I could find, came from China. Couldn't even get one in Australia where the concert was held. It was worth the wait. The DVD had pretty good sound, but the blu ray tops that, and the picture quality is the icing in the cake. The whole package is a better than being there experience. Australia reaaly seems to be the place to make concerts videos. I have so many in my collection now, including Pink's Funhiuse. Oh, I must not forget the performances of The Eagles themselves. This is the Eagles at their best. Everyone sober and having fun, playing better than ever. Don't forget to watch the interview extras too.
B001L2COFK|4.0|After signing with Warner Bros' Records in 1983, Eric Clapton bounced back on the          music charts for the first time in five years, and he solidified this return with this instant          success from 1985 that already found The Guitar God serenading to a new generation          of admirers and fans alike.  Showcased with blistering guitar solos, a high-octane R&B          beat and a slick synthesizer-backed production, Clapton have again raised the roof on          Behind The Sun, a realistic CD that gives us a truly resonate listening experience that          is well-suited for the pop-rock market and the solid rock guitar sound.  Though there is          never a dull moment, he gives his guitar equal billing as it feature majestic tracks such          as She's Waiting, the blues-rock crowd-pleaser Same Old Blues, It All Depends, Fore-         ver Man and even his take on the 1960's soul favourite Knock On Wood.  Backed with          a stellar line-up of stellar musicians under the auspices of producers Lenny Waronker          and Rod Templeman, Behind The Sun feature `new' songs written by songwriter Jerry          Williams, who had made this disc is a vividly-pace masterwork that is certainly another          shining moment in Clapton's rich spectacular legacy.  However, despite the tinkering it          went on the become one of his finest (if not better) albums and was soon certified gold          record status nearly two years after it's release which the resulting CD became a time-         time-honoured success and even a truly unique and popular success.  However, what          also came from the making of this joyful and superlative CD are six outtakes that were          left out of the Behind The Sun session and needs to be included as soon as possible--         as they included Loving Your Lovin', Heaven Is Just A Step Away (where it come from          the Back To The Future soundtrack), Jailbait (the b-side to She's Waiting), You Don't          Know Like I Know, Too Bad and One Jump Ahead Of The Storm.

Within the filming technology limitations of the days, this is captures the performances of all the key players in what is essentially a greatest hits concerts. Great camera work and editing, cuts to the right action st the right time. The audio, with fewer technology limitations is excellent for the time.

B00AZM7IQC|5.0|I have at least a dozen Cirque Du Soleil DVD's right from the time we first saw Saltimbanco live in Sydney Australia. I bought this blue ray, a little nervous that we would see 'more of the same'. But no, my wife and I were blown away by the performances and production quality. The shows are so well integrated that it seems like a single show, rather than segments from several Las Vegas shows. Full marks.
B00136Q1NK|5.0|After making a few highly accomplished albums for Prestige and great albums for the          Riverside labels from 1955 to 1961, Thelonious Monk signed his recording contract with          Columbia Records in late 1962 where he recorded his next masterpiece when he had a          few old tricks and plenty of new directions he would had in store for his then expanding          audiences.  Released in 1963, Monk's Dream finds Monk pursuing of what would be an          approach primarily beholden for Bebop that was un-deniably \\"boppish\\", Monk's singular          sense of harmony and time placed him well beyond Bebop's parameters, when after it's          release, it was clear to all but the most obtuse of listeners that their was a even defining          method to his groundbreaking virtuosity.  Featuring a track set that features a few bright          new compositions starting with the title track as well as Bolivar Blues, Bright Mississippi          and Five Spot Blues (formally Blues Five Spot) as well as a variety of tuneful reinditions          of classic standards such as Just A Gigolo, Body And Soul and Sweet And Lovely, as it          find him softening up his piano artistry while he maintain his perfect touch. Hailed as his          crowning achievement, what adds to the irony of Monk's Music is, just as producer Orin          Keepnews points out in one of the reissue notes, it established yet another pattern later          that followed, which makes this timeless blockbuster a universal success as the release          of this unique landmark album when made it quite clear for the listeners that their was a          solid method to his suppose madness where he was, after Duke Ellington, jazz' premier          composer.  Digitally-remastered and expanded into it's complete format, Monk's Dream          serves as another timeless testament from this highly acclaimed monumental jazz giant,          where it is undoubtedly a highlight of his astonishingmusic career, which proves to be a          recurrent dream come true to old and new fans alike, and it will shine on for the ages as          one of his greatest masterpieces and undoubtfully, a highlight of his astonishing career,          has proved to be a recurrent dream old and young admirers- or jazz fans alike.
B00EPL4PBK|5.0|It has a very 90's metal vibe to it. You can hear influences in the music from Guns and Roses & Metallica. Is this bad?  Not in my opinion. I had to listen to the album a few times before I could totally appreciate what they where trying to do on this album. I like when bands try new things and this is a good example of that.
B002T9RLCA|5.0|With U2 riding high on the international charts and selling out concerts during<br />  the 1980’s—and to what lies ahead for their future, U2 released another timeless<br />  and enduring masterpiece in 1984.  Showcasing a dark, near-hallucinatory series<br />  of interlocking soundscapes that are occasionally punctuated by it’s recognizable<br />  melodies, The Unforgettable Fire delivers the thoroughly versatile phrase in their<br />  burgeoning success as it brims with high energy and inspirational passion, which<br />  would make it their most pivotal album that heralded a coming of age period that<br />  also redefines the band as a creative unit while The Edge offers layers of effects<br />  driven guitar solos.  Containing the high-pitched Top Ten hit Pride (In The Name<br />  Of Love) and the title track, The Unforgettable Fire is a forceful set of thoughtfully<br />  atmospheric ideals, themes, emotion, compassion and especially with the band’s<br />  fond embracement for sonic bombast music landscape, as they chose to explore<br />  multi-layered effects-laden music solos by Bono and The Edge. (The band would<br />  floundered on there reading of Elvis Presley And America, one of two near-error<br />  mistakes, but they did managed to handle it carefully well).  What you will get on<br />  the digitally-remastered 2-CD deluxe format are a fresh set of non-CD singles, B<br />  sides and unissued tracks, including Disappearing Act, Yoshino Blossom, 4th Of<br />  July, Sixty Minutes To Kingdom Come and even their long version of 11 O’Clock<br />  Tick Tock , which truly make this ultimate edition sound 100% perfect than ever.<br />  Now go get yourself the deluxe edition, because it stands out as truly the best!

B001NBO2OA|5.0|As the 1980’s dawned with both cautious optimism and bleak awareness, a new          powerful young rock band from Ireland impressed the music world when their debut          featured a bold rebellious act that became the vital force for their socially-conscious          artistry. When U2’s highly anticipated album Boy first came out in 1980, it would not          only make the band a household name in rock and roll, but would even showcase a          new debut experience that focuses on the thoughts and frustrations of adolescence          in a positive and fascinating light.  Starting with a bang on the surprise Top Ten hit I          Will Follow, it would ushered in a brand new era for cutting edge artistry and unique          songwriting filled with hope and inspiration on other songs, such as Twilight, An Cat          Dubh, Out Of Control, the epic landscape-focused The Ocean, The Electric Co. and          Shadows And Tall Trees--there nod to William Goulding’s novel Lord Of The Flies--         which this magnificent rock band would nevertheless be highly praised and admired          for.  Reissued in it’s deluxe 2-CD edition, Boy sound much better and 100% perfect          than it did since 1980, where Disc 2 offers a dynamic conclusion that catch them in          a live performance that they gave at London’s famed Marquee Club, where the live          tracks even include both sides of the showstopping instrumental hit 11 O’Clock Tick          Tock, Out Of Control and a different take on Twilight.  And you will even get to hear          a set of unreleased songs like Cartoon World and the bizarre Saturday Night, which          even shows that the band would always have big ideas rather than with small ones.          From the onset, U2 went for the big message stating that every song on their debut          album would sound huge with oceans of solid, processed guitars cascading around          Bono’s wail aided by post-punk texturesand The Edge’s ringing guitar solo. As part          of Island Records mission to expand U2’s albums into there own deluxe format, this          edition of the band’s debut album is a historic must to have.

B005Y5D7JM|5.0|When U2 entered the 1990’s in full force, they realize that they had to change          their look and upgrade their music with a edgier and hip, calliber-driven attitude to          keep in line with the times.  While maintaining their original world class status, the          band knew they had to update their own rock and roll artistry by giving it a stylish,          diverse sound, and Achtung Baby!, released in 1991, was one of those examples.          Showcased by a superb Post-modern contemporary European sound and cutting          edge rock, the band takes a striking avant-garde approach to their music which is          peppered with dance beats, a dash of hip-hop and velocity-driven guitar riffs as it          feature a high-rocking track set including several Top Ten hits, such as the chart-         topping hits Mysterious Ways and Zoo Station, as well as other classic hits, such          as Even Better Than The Real Thing, One and Who’s Gonna Ride Your Horses.          Drawing in from electronica phenomenon that originated in Europe, especially in          Germany, by the 1970’s and the contemporary sound of the thriving Madchester’          club scene in the early-1990’s which took place in Britain, Achtung Baby! sounds          just as vibrantly and endlessly.  Now remastered in it’s deluxe edition, a fabulous          serving on Disc Two contain B-sides and special remixes that includes The Lady          With The Spinning Head, Satellite Of Love, an unreleased outtake of Blow Your          House Down, superb remixed versions of Even Better Than The Real Thing and          Mysterious Ways and a disco take on C.C.R.’s Fortunate Son. Recorded in both          Berlin and Dublin right after German Unification, and produced by Daniel Lanois          and Brian Eno, this thoroughly diverse rock and roll labour of love is just another          groundbreaking landmark blockbuster from U2 that will live on for ages.

B0014EQ2HG|5.0|Brilliant Corners would be Thelonious Monk's next breakthrough album just after a<br />  decade as a recording artist and nine years after achieving worldwide celebrite for his<br />  groundbreaking debut album as this recording session proved challenging to listeners<br />  and all-stars whom had participated on it.  With Monk already enhancing his works on<br />  wax to long extended notes, both the consoluted title track and the angular Pannocica<br />  were particularly difficult to nail down as it required multiple takes, but yet the ultimate<br />  results on Brilliant Corners provided a spectacular, where it proved an immortal album<br />  that have marked the definition of Monk's dominance of the jazz since it was released<br />  in 1957.  Beginning with the convoluted title track, the stellar album makes space with<br />  other tracks for the sounds of Monk on celeste he performs well with unique charm on<br />  Pannonica, while the brilliant band line-up consists of Sonny Rollins (who gave one of<br />  his greatest and memorable saxophone solos), bassist Oscar Pettiford and even Max<br />  Roach.  Plus, Monk showcase an astringent piano solo on the 1930's Depression-Era<br />  ballad I Remember Dear, while Roach strikes up the percussion on tympani where he<br />  hits the absolute note on Bemsha Swing, that make this brilliant session a lasting and<br />  impressive masterwork from Monk's rich highly creative legacy. Still as challenging to<br />  ever, this immortal album will always remain as mesmerizing as ever.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|This book is so intelligently written and so candid that I was confused at first thinking it was a memoir rather than a novel. I've recommended it to many friends. Just don't read anything about it or let anyone tell you anything before you read it for yourself.

B00BH0VSM6|5.0|I have now read all the available Harry Hole mystery stories by Jo Nesbo. At least until the latest appears in a little more than a week...Yes! The Harry Hole  [Hol eh] novels are wonderful from the very beginning: rich, powerful narrative with great internal and external action and dialogue. And here is the most intriguing thing about Harry: even as he is so aware of his aloneness, he is able to make meaningful connections with others. Not just women, but individuals encountered on his way to finding the solution to the mystery. He is a man who, in spite of his alcoholism, embraces life. In 'The Bat', he free-falls into its arms. He loves a myth, he loves a metaphor, he savors a mystery. If you are fortunate enough to read this series in order, 'The Bat' will not only give you a taste of Harry's childhood and life experiences, it will give give you a mystery, a thriller, that is set in contemporary Australian culture. You will not be able to put it down.

B00FEX1AA2|1.0|I had anticipated a much scarier movie than this. Maybe it would have made a difference if the people around us were screaming in terror. Often, that can affect how one reacts to a movie. However, when we went to see this, the theater was half full, and the people around us were making fun of the film. We actually moved to the very front row so we could enjoy the movie. However, moving away from the crowd didn't help. My friend and I both found this movie to be extremely corny. The acting was pretty good ( I love Lilli and Vera, especially), and the plot was pretty interesting. I personally don't mind when a movie borrows heavily from other films, as this one obviously did, as long as it improves upon the original material. After the first 45 minutes, it became apparent that this movie was not going to live up to the hype. I think the main problems were that the script was sloppy and the special effects were weak and cheap looking. It was particularly disappointing to feel the suspense build....to nothing. In the end, I really found the suspenseful scenes to be disappointing and the script poorly written. It also might have been better had the<br />special effects been scary.

B00FEHXCIG|3.0|I enjoyed the first two far better than this movie. This movie was an interesting extension of the series, but seemed a bit &#34;out of place&#34; when considering the capabilities of Iron Man established in the first two installments and The Avengers. Iron Man appeared weak and paltry. I'm sure this was the desire, to convey a since of Tony Stark loosing himself and Iron man along with it, but it went way too far. I wouldn't be super jazzed to see this movie a second time.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|Imitation sure is a funny thing. On one hand you are paying homage to your idol, on the other hand you are ripping them off mercilessly. It is no secret that imitation runs rampant in Pop music. There have been numerous artists who have built their entire careers on invoking a past artists style (Lady GaGa anyone?) Some do it well and some don't do it well at all, but the trick to imitation is to never let it appear too obvious that you are the copycat. True artists know how to invoke an era or artist, without sacrificing their creativity (and getting sued.)<br /><br />Ariana Grande is a relative newcomer on the scene and most people are familiar with her because of an acting role on Nickelodeon's sitcoms Victorious and ICarly. In the early part of 2013 she released her first single \\"The Way\\" and it became a surprise top ten hit in the US. It was clear to anyone who heard the track, that Ariana was inspired heavily by divas Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey. Especially Mariah Carey, whom she attempts to emulate with whistle register like high notes throughout the track. This caused quite a few people to accuse her stealing Mariah's act, while others were delighted at the thought of a new Mariah. I must say as a Mariah fan, that I can always use more singers like Mariah Carey to add to my collection. So in general I like her, Although I have a slight difficulty in calling her \\"the new Mariah Carey.\\"<br /><br />\\"Honeymoon Avenue\\" - Starts the album on a high note. I love the lyrical metaphors about driving and Ariana sounds really good here. A lot of people have remarked how this gives them an early 90's feeling, which isn't surprising because Babyface (whom Mariah worked with on her Daydream and Music Box albums) helped produce and write the majority of \\"Yours Truly.\\" For me though, I hear more of a '06 era Danity Kane vibe throughout the album and it's refreshing to hear vocals that aren't drenched in electronic sound effects. 4.5/5<br /><br />\\"Baby I\\" - Is a vocal workout, but I don't feel it was as good of a single as The Way. On this track the melody speeds, slows and whirls and the end result is slightly sloppy. The lyrics are nice, the production is decent, but there's just a tad too much going on at once. The track can't seem to decide whether it wants to be a mid-tempo or and an uptempo. Also it's kinda hard to understand what Ariana is singing in the chorus. 4/5<br /><br />\\"Right There\\" - Screams out Paula Deanda circa 2006! This rap collaboration features a playful rap by Big Sean and they work very well together. There's not much more to say about this track. It's a good track, but it's nothing we haven't heard Paula Deanda or Tynisha Keli do before. 4/5<br /><br />\\"Tattooed Heart\\" - a lot has been said about this fifties Doo-wop tinged, Forever (Mariah Carey) soundalike and most of it is not good. A lot of reviewers have derided its slow, shuffle-like pace. I actually found the track quite likable. I like the fifties style production and cutesy lyrics. Ariana's vocals on this track are exceptionally strong and the track comes off well. 4/5<br /><br />\\"Lovin' It\\" - For some reason doesn't stand out in my mind as much as the other tracks do and I have to listen to the track right now, so I can tell you my thoughts. I must say though, that from the times I listened to the track, I was satisfied. This track is a nice r&b and pop hybrid and I think it's one of the better songs on the album. 4/5<br /><br />\\"Piano\\" - I didn't immediately like the track, but I must say it's grown on me. This track is about trying to give the world an anthem and song that will make people feel good about themselves. This track makes me feel happy. 3/5<br /><br />\\"Daydreamin'\\" - is my favorite song on the album. I adore its cutesy lyrics and gentle melody. Just like track #4, Daydreamin' features this 50's shuffle like sound, but While Tattooed heart sounded unfinished, Daydreamin' sounds well thought out. Ariana's vocals slip and slide aroundin between a strong belt and a soft coo, that is highly reminiscent of Mariah Carey. Great track! 5/5<br /><br />\\"The Way\\" - Is the highest performing single of Ariana's career thus far and it's not hard to understand why...It's also the most top 40 sounding track of anything she's recorded. Mac Miller gives a playful rap here and the track is just bouncy and great fun. 4.5/5<br /><br />\\"You'll Never Know\\" - reached its chorus and I felt like I was sixteen again, living in 2006 and listening to Paula DeAnda or Danity Kane. This track is like a retro throwback to before electro/european pop music became hugely popular in 2008. I must say I'm kinda torn between thinking the retro sound is cool and innovative or just old and dated, but I do like the track and its ability to give me nostalgia. 4/5<br /><br />\\"Almost is Never Enough\\" - is a duet between Grande's current boy friend Nathan Sykes, from the pop boyband The Wanted. Before I bought the album, I was already familiar with this song, as I saw a live performance on Youtube. The melody is organic and the lyrics are smart and not overly cheesy. Both vocalists put enough of their hearts into the song, without oversinging and it's refreshing that they let the melody serve as the main attraction and did not clutter the song with unnecessary runs or vocal gymnastics. 5/5<br /><br />\\"Popular Song\\" - I was aware of this song before I got the album, but had no idea Ariana was behind it. I don't know really what to say about this song. While apart of me is glad it's on the album, another half of me says it should've been left off. I like the song (in a quirky kind of way), but it sounds even more of an oddball than \\"Piano.\\" Still it's a nice song, regardless of its eccentricities. 3.5/5<br /><br />\\"Better Left Unsaid\\" - Not really a fan of this song. It sounds to much like top 40, but it's a nice way to close out the album. 2.5/5<br /><br />In conclusion, I found Ariana Grande's album to be a generally refreshing and enjoyable pop album. I was kinda let down on the 90's influence promise though, as \\"Yours Truly\\" sounds like a relic from my early high school days. As for the Mariah Carey comparisons, While they are welcome, they are not entirely valid in my opinion. Mariah has a far better vocal technique and range than Ariana. I think that the reason they're getting compared is Ariana continually tries to use her whistle register (key word: Tries) and when she softly coos, her tone sounds unmistakably like MC. I must admit that initially my reaction to Ariana was \\"Who does this chick think she's kidding? She's no Mariah!\\", but at the end of the day I think she knows that.<br /><br />So, I urge everyone to put their views aside when listening this album. Whether you think she's a copycat or the second coming, suspend all of those beliefs and just judge the music. If You do, I promise you'll find something to like about \\"Yours Truly.\\"in between a strong belt and a soft coo, that is highly reminiscent of Mariah Carey.

B006AZZPCM|1.0|Worked fine for the first few weeks, then i installed the upgrade..... now videos dont want to play, literally it takes up to 6 tries to play a video. Then when it finally does play, forget about pausing or skipping to an earlier/later part of the video. That is unless youre okay with the video stopping and having to retry playing it 6 more times until the whole app just crashes. Just one of many a noying problems since the upgrade that i dont care to waste anymore time writing about which nonetheless make this an extremely aggrivating app to use.
B005PW3OS8|5.0|corny? -YES!<br />predictable? - YES!<br /><br />DUDE! they are making marvel marvel comic book characters  movies,,,,,,, nuff said!<br /><br />well a bit more..<br /><br />I grew up reading marvel comics, for the world I was forced to live in marvel was easier to relate to then DC. superman was PERFECT = unreal. marvel characters had flaws and early on had black people in them that said real things. nick fury as a brotha, SO marvel!<br /><br />the marvel folks can do no wrong in my mind, ( not counting fantastic four- REBOOT PLEASE STAT! )<br /><br />as for all the rest - more please, I am happy - for all you critics that say the movies are unrealistic - THEY ARE COMIC BOOKS GET A FRICKING GRIP! people are going to see the marvel movies in DROVES! WHY? because marvel stories are awesome.<br />and yes i am a true believer, always was, always will be! finally....NUFF SAID!

0425261360|1.0|About 50 or so pages into this slogfest I was trying to remember why I bought it. My brain was by then too numb to recall. Very little happens in this book and certainly nothing that will hold your interest beyond a passing thought. The endless dialogue, like the story itself, is boring and so uninteresting that counting flowers on the wall suddenly appeals to you as an attractive alternative. Past those first 50 or so pages I fast forwarded and found that a hundred pages later the best thing to do was fast forward another hundred pages and so on until the book ended. May I suggest that future editions come with an apology from the author.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game I think this game is the most awesome game I've ever played. I like how in every place there are some collectables also my little sister loves to watch the trains drive by.
B008BO65S8|5.0|One can really tell that the authors of this book have experienced more of Iran than most people ever will.    They give great advice such as bringing cash with you into Iran and exchanging it there. The survival Farsi at the end of the book is very useful. But what I really liked was how intimate their account is, and what a remarkable country and people. What is excellent about this guide is that it gives you practical knowledge about the history and culture of Iran, although the book tends to highlight contemporary history and culture.    I read this as I traveled through Iran, though I didn't have to rely on it as a practical guide because I went on a guided tour. The book is very accessible and offers a solid overview of Iran for the first time traveler. I read it more for pleasure than for logistical travel purposes, and enjoyed it very much.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put the book down! Fifty shades of emotion just from reading. I want my very own Christian Grey.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Upgrade one - Cannot find a way to add albums or songs to wish list when in the store.<br />Upgrade two - There is no recently viewed from the store.<br />Upgrade three - would like to send feedback or bugs from app.<br /><br />Otherwise it does what it is supposed to for the most part and works well with the Samsung phone I have.
B004WKH4PS|5.0|This is a movie famous for remaking Joan Crawford's career, but it is a crackerjack piece of early film noir, and from a major studio at that.  Only Paramount's &#34;Double Indemnity&#34; starring two other top tier stars (Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray) would be as &#34;noir-ish,&#34; and really a much better film but who's quibbling. Crawford is great at re-tooling the working girl persona that made her a star, has aged, married, had children, divorced and gone broke, and is scrambling to make something of herself.  But it's bitchy Ann Blyth, oily Zachary Scott, and two-faced good 'ole boy Jack Carson who walk away with it.  Michael Curtiz sets the tone, along with the professional way Warner Brothers understood how to make middle class look like middle class.  And always, always, always the inimitable, sublime Eve Arden, who can do more with a snappy line reading than anyone in history (Christine Baranski must have studied every film she was ever in). Dark for a long time, but redemptive.  And though it would haunt her memory in the minds of people who read her child's memoir &#34;Mommie Dearest,&#34;  no child in history ever so deserved the slap she got as Veda.  Ann Blyth is famously quoted as saying it was real, too.  Yum.

B004XZR63M|4.0|I've read this book years ago and probably didn't realize how much it effected my views about financial freedom. Great reading it for the second time just as a sanity check that I'm heading the right direction out of the rat race
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Just when you go through twists and turns and figure it out it takes you in a new direction. Blake Crouch books make you want to cover your eyes! You know when things get scary in a movie and that's all you can do, that's how I feel with his books. Things can get worse and they do, but you still have hope for the cast involved. Can't wait for the next one and I do hope they make a TV series. It would be great! Don't know if I want to see the Abbies in person though!
B006W33UC4|5.0|These Tom Moulton mixes on so many Philly International tracks are fantastic!  None of the tracks are ruined with extra production.... the flavor and feel of the original tracks are retained!  You can't beat the quality here!  Highly recommended!

B000N2HBSO|5.0|This look at Lincoln and his political rivals--Seward, Chase, and Stanton--is simply amazing. Using his political talents, Lincoln, as this book so ably shows, brought his rivals into his cabinet during the Civil War and brought out the best in them to help win the war. Chase in paying for the war, Seward at the State Department and as Lincoln's top advisor, and Stanton heading up the War Department.<br /><br />The last time I felt such awe for a book of nonfiction was when I finished David McCullough's masterpiece, [[ASIN:141657588X John Adams]]. Goodwin really made the Civil War era come to life for me.<br /><br />For me, it started out a tad slowly as the author introduced the rivals but, once it got going, it was unstoppable.<br /><br />Outstanding book. Highly, highly recommended!!
B004QL7K70|1.0|Thanks to Warner Bros. For putting out the blueprint for the utter destruction of your very own home, if some brain dead teenager tries this I hope it's on one of the streets where a WB ex. lives, what in the world were you thinking putting this trash out where all the American Idol watchers can see it!, this \\"movie\\" should be pulled off the market and burned!, it has ZERO redeeming value!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Broadchurch had wonderful writing, great visuals and especially fine acting. I could feel the anguish of the parents, the community and the police working the case. The final episode was as fine television as I have ever seen. I can't wait for season two.

B00CRS5HII|5.0|I really loved Darius' concert in Maryland in 2012. Was excited about this newest album, True Believers, and it did not disappoint! This man is talented and he's entertaining! Not many artists can successfully cross-over from a genre into a new one, but he's done it and while I loved his music as Hootie and the Blowfish, I enjoy his new music even more. Thanks for the entertainment Darius!! Looking forward to hearing more!
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Interesting thesis on the pathway to success.  I enjoyed even more the second time.  It should be assigned reading in high school.
B001AQT0RC|3.0|If there was ever a film that cheapened science fiction, while promoting the sheer stupidity of Hollywood, Contact is it.<br /><br />Despite the intriguing scenario of another sentient species acknowledging us, in this case via a television signal first broadcast from the Berlin Olympics sent back to us to get our attention, followed by information about the species involved. Allowing idiotic diatribes between politicians, religious maniacs and other assorted groups to become the common denominator in the script, totally ruined the film for me.<br /><br />As for all of the constant scenes about America's various crackpots and their opinions on science, why did Hollywood think it would appeal to the rest of the world?
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Sometimes a sequel just can't touch the original. Doctor Sleep was great. No disappointment.  But then Doctor Sleep is what we expect from Stephen King.
B0014DQSG2|5.0|A little bit of nostalgia.<br />I am from Iranian parents. I was born in England (Manchester) and lived there for most of my life but I am currently living in the USA. I know both cultures very well. I think UK and USA are meant to be together.<br />Love you both countries ! Of course I also love Iran ! :)
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|For the price I paid this case was pretty good, I use it mainly to keep the dust off of my Kindle and some protection from scratching when I set the device down or forget its there and set something next to it. It fits the Kindle perfectly and if you want to use the stand I suggest you don't get this if you expect it to stay up if you're pressing down on the kindle, I think it's mainly for watching movies rather then say playing games or situations when you need to constantly touch the kindles screen, if you aren't careful the backing slips out and it doesn't stand up. There are other cases out there that are more sturdy then this, so decide on how you're going to use your kindle and go from there.
1587143879|5.0|After being certified several years ago and letting it lapse (bad idea, kids) I needed to re-start my certification track. Cisco has introduced the concept of technology trains into their certifications so all 3 levels - CCNA, CCNP, and CCIE - all now have technology specialization tracks. The CCNA Routing & Switching material here provides the training necessary to pass both of the \\"pre-cert\\" tests (which will wind up granting you the CCENT cert along the way, if you go that route) or to pass the 1 \\"combined\\" test that gets you straight to the CCNA R&S.<br /><br />These books are very well written with explanations about how the technology got to the point where it is today, lots of tips and techniques, and a full treatment of everything you would need to know to pass the exam. A study strategy of how to use the 2 books together to study in a coherent manner for the test is provided and I do recommend you follow it. I use these skills for my job and I held certifications previously, so this was more a matter of studying up on current approaches and reminding myself of technologies that I don't use daily than anything else, so I managed to get through all of this in about 4 days of serious study. That said, I think anyone with some basic understanding of the concepts of networking should be able to use this material to pass the certification test in 2-3 weeks if you put in the time to read it all.<br /><br />Cisco Press has released some serious dogs in their day but this set is definitely not one of those. It's worth the money and the time and I think you'll be well pleased.
B00F5FBE82|4.0|I'm a Drake fan and I think that this album was great (lyrically developed and very professional production) but Take Care was better just because his flows had more cleverness and rhythm variation.

B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|I was excited when I downloaded game, thinking I would get to play more than a few minutes, before I was asked to buy more sequels.  If you want to get me hooked into spending my money...let me really get hooked in the story (game).
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|The changes of the era challenges them to adapt... it's amusing in a way.  Kind of like how the Southern Plantations of America vanished after the Civil War in &#34;Gone with the Wind&#34;.  Have no idea why it appeals to me.  I suppose, I wish I had their problems!
B00BB8Q1RQ|2.0|The movie was trying to be a touchy feely as possible. With the kids and seasons - yeah, that's cute. The movie itself about Abortion was not pleasant. It took away the good nature of the movie. I did like the main character finding himself & going out into the world. Not a movie I would watch again. There is one song played throughout the movie, but I like it.
B005LF9KMI|2.0|This movie was pretty boring and not scary. It was more weird than anything else and I totally wasted an hour and a half of my life watching it.

B002KQ6BT6|5.0|This is an amazingly suspenseful book.  I'm still reading it.  True Dan Brown suspense, you get the impression even Robert Langdon doesn't have a clue this time.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|This book keeps your attention and on the edge of your seat. I really enjoyed it and would recommend this to anyone who likes the kind of fiction stories that have magic in them. I like everything about the book.
0439023483|1.0|Stephen King and Stephanie Meyer praised this book...that should be an indicator to set off warning lights. Two of the worst writers in history, both terribly overrated, praise an equally terrible and overrated book.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is written in first-person present tense, a style which limits itself by default. The writer contrains herself to the character's point of view and clearly struggles with sentence structure and making herself understood. The premise is unoriginal and suspiciously similar to another work with the same plot, Battle Royale.<br /><br />Evidently aimed towards naive teenagers with no sense of good taste in literatura, the same crowd that devours Twilight, this book is a shamefully overrated pustule on the face of American literatura. Avoid it like a plague.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Moriarty has written another tale of the human sprint and how it copes with the unthinkable.  The story feel real.  It is full of real feelings, thoughts and fears experienced by each of the main characters with clarity and thoughtfulness.
B009AMANBA|5.0|While strict historians may quibble over some points in the film, it would be hard to deny the cinematic strengths of  this film.  Day-Lewis has, as is his forte, subsumed himself in Lincoln.  Seeing the film has made me resolve to read, in its entirety, Team of Rivals by Doris Kearns Goodwin.  The book reaches far beyond the film, but Goodwin's exploration of the political development and personal lives of Lincoln and his cabinet members informs much of the screenplay.
B00ESB75FA|5.0|Such a cute show. I'm just sad it ending but I can't wait for future Ted to say &#34;and kids that's how I met ur mother.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|First of all - it is Angry Birds. But the extra addition of Star Wars just makes it more fun. I've always love how this game plays - and with the extra dimensions added to it, it is fun for everyone in the family.

B006S01GH2|5.0|Another classic from one of the best directors alive. Audrey is stellar as Amelie and the storyline is intimately divine.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|it is a good game that requires balance, focus, and an imagination!!!<br /><br />My favorite is when you duck under the bear, my least favorite is cleaning the throwup
B00CLD671A|5.0|It makes you realize that, whatever you think is the most terrible, Beastly, Horrific behavior  we see in today's times has been going<br /><br />on for Centuries and Centuries. Except in those day's it was very easily expected to be hushed up for fear of scandal.
B00174TKGI|5.0|very good movie i am very pleased. once again amazon has more than met my satisfaction. i will definitely be buying more movies from amazon
B000062XFG|5.0|As for seasons 1 and 3, I purchased used media and was very pleased with the quality and the value of the product.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is entertaining and fun yet difficult I recommend this for all ages I am addicted to this game I hope they come out with a second one
B000063V8R|5.0|Took a chance on used media to save money (and to get the original packaging - reviews of the &#34;New Release&#34; were less than rave).  Was NOT disappointed - all discs and packaging were in very good condition (I'd even say excellent).  For once, my attempts to reduce cost actually paid off &#60;grin&#62;.
B00992CF6W|4.0|While I really like this a lot.  Wish there horses and birds and dogs and cats. That would make it a 5 star in my book
B0036S4B6M|4.0|but overall a great read.  It was nice to hear a woman's prison perspective.  I didn't want it to end and wish that Piper would have talked about her life after prison as well.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is 1 of the greatest site's to find fabulous ideas for any hobbies or inspirations needed on any and every project possibility.  Absolutely love P interest.  A word of warning, It's extremely addicting.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I can't say enough about the Walking Dead show.  It is new, well-written, and completely different from anything already on TV.  I am completely hooked.  I felt it was worth it to buy the third season so I could watch it while waiting for the new season to debut.  The product itself was fine and I am very satisfied.
B00351YEVC|5.0|I enjoyed the book immensely and gained valuable insight due to the simplicity. To be able to write through the eyes of a child is excellent and opens the readers eyes to a different aspect of a topic that has been very vastly covered.
B00FHAB3HW|5.0|I love it. I love Miley!! There is 1 song that I'm not a fan of, but she sold me on the rest so I'm not sorry that I made that investment AT ALL! Always a Miley Fan (:
B008HJGPVO|2.0|Ordered two stylus,the finest one split on the medium tip  after six weeks of use.Would not reorder another from this<br />Company.
B000E1OI7G|4.0|\\"Traffic\\" tells three different stories in one movie, interwoven together, and using a different sets of saturation and colors to differentiate all three. The stories all deal with people affected by the war on drugs. Sounds ambitious, right? Well it is. It's a risky gamble taken by Director Steven Soderbergh, but for the most part, it works.<br /><br />In my opinion, the most interesting story presented here is that of Michael Douglas, a judge who is about to be tapped as the U.S. drug czar. What makes his story all the more interesting is that his 16 year old daughter is a heroin addict. Douglas gives a really understated, yet powerful performance in his role and I think it's among the best work he's ever done.<br /><br />What doesn't work so well in Traffic is that since the narrative jumps from story to story, the pacing of the movie isn't fluid. Some of the stories are moving at a faster pace than others, and that starts to weigh the movie down.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Steven Soderbergh, then I would recommend Traffic.
B00BMR4RIG|4.0|THIS APP IS MUCH MUCH BETER THAN ITS COMPETITOR APPS THT I UNINSTALLED MY OTHER WEATHER APP TO KEEP THIS ONE BECAUSE ITS MORE ACCURATE AND IT ALSO LOOKS BETTER ON THE HOME SCREEN THE PRICE DEOSNT BREAK THE BANK EITHER.
161655164X|5.0|I don't ever buy the art books for games. I loved 'The Last of us' so much I wanted to dig even deeper into Ellie and Joel's story. This book was filled with beautiful art and lots of information about the characters and game development. So worth the purchase!
B0001HAISG|5.0|Great movie, great classic, great music,  everything was cast and acted perfectly. Jeremy, Rachel, Jason were terrific and tinkerbell gave a really funny comic relief.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Downloaded for my kids, then I started playing and now I'm hooked!  It is actually alot harder than it seems.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|When I need extra power, the Anker® Astro2 8400mAh External Battery Pack is great. I don't have to lug around an iPhone case with extra battery all the time. If I have a long day, or a day away from power, I can take this with me to ensure I have the juice I need for my iPhone. It's also great when traveling overseas where the opportunities to plug in may be fewer.<br />I don't use it much, so I'll have to see what the life of this is.<br />I'm about to switch to a Lightning-connected iPhone 5s. Will be interesting to see how much it costs me to connect this external battery to my new phone.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent show. This last season was a very sad season. Wonderful characters. Love this show! Looking forward to the new season!
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|The special effects were great but the story was a mashup of many other films from the Matrix to Terminator to Mad Max.
B00FPH3YQA|5.0|Yep they did it again. I was concerned with reading reviews that I may not like this 3rd installment- but I actually thought it was darn good!
B005C0DHEY|3.0|I give it 3 stars, I would give it more stars, but too much of the so-called &#34;evidence&#34; is anecdotal.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I heard this song and bought the entire album. While not everything on the album is as great as Carry On and Some Nights, it is a truly great piece of music. You will surely love it.
B001BANK32|5.0|Before I bought Dr. Sleep I wanted to reread one of my favorite Stephen King Classics. Still holds up as one of the best, scariest books around!!
B00D2ZF3GQ|2.0|VERY disappointed in this movie. I love Sci Fi movies and will even watch the bad ones but the acting in this one really sucked.  Jaden Smith cannot act.  I am guessing that Will Smith is helping his son get into acting and tho this is his first movie he doesnt have the knack for it. Maybe as it was his character and how he felt the character should be portrayed over time his acting will get better.  Kinda sorry I even paid moneuy for this movie.
B0073TZ1AA|5.0|Great application, this application accomplish is what I was looking for strongly recommend you getting it. Buy today! you won't go wrong with this application
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Perfect transition to Playstaion 3 High Def. Fighting monsters and saving the girl was epic then and still epic now.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really enjoy this game.  Nice how the backgrounds change every couple weeks to keep the game interesting.  Would be nice if different characters had different abilities.  But enjoy the game just the same.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Very funny, cute movie whether you're expecting or not. Shows families and mothers in all stages of life. Would recommend to anyone.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|could not put this one down!  great story.  easy to connect with the characters.  can just picture tbis as a movie......  hope there will be a sequel
B0039O8AQK|3.0|It is a typical Orwell.  Conspiracy and Government is bad. Check out Animal Farm, it also has this same feel and has barn yard animals.
1594202273|5.0|I was a bit daunted by the 600 pages. However, I could not put this book down!  One of my best reads ever.  If you have any interest in military history, science, politics, then this book is for you. Fascinating!
1439153663|5.0|It had mystery, romance, action. It would make a good movie. It was very well written and I had a hard time putting it down. I thought the characters were believable and I liked how the story was told from different perspectives. I hope to read more from this author.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I am a fan of star trek. I have watched it from the first tv series.  With modern tech it is better than ever.  I would recommend it to anyone who understands the tech world.
B000N5F6OW|5.0|John Wayne is my all time favorite, but I love this movie!!  The cast is so versatile and the storyline great!!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Worth the 2.5 hours! Robert Downey Jr. steals the movie. Chris Evans kills it. Loki gets what's coming to him. PUNY GOD!
B008M721MS|4.0|It's a very good app and you can tell effort was put in the only thing though is it lags on video messages and sometimes shuts down but we can all live with that
159463176X|5.0|I loved this book!  I've read all of Khaled Hosseini's books and this was just as good as all of his other books.  I highly recommend reading it!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is perfect for its kind since its free, easy, doesn't ask for a micro transaction every mission, and you make money fast. Very good
B00E9P959E|5.0|The remastered version of Vapor Trails was done perfectly!  It sounds especially fantastic on LP.  I cant imagine how the remastering could have been done any better
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the best games ever. I play it almost all of time. Gett it nowwwww. Just download and have a lot of fun.
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|The Expendables 2 is a fun popcorn movie but is basically a redo of every action movie these Action Stars did in the 80's. It's fun, completely unbelievable and at times a bit silly.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This does what you think it will, a basic calculator for your quick mathematics, a must have for anyone... I highly recommend this app
B008FPOIT6|4.0|If J.J. Abrams had a book store it would be Mr. Penumbra's 24 hour bookstore, a quirky place that really has no interest in selling any books.  There are a few books that the general populous might like but all of them are used and none of them are current.  Instead there is a large section of beautiful bound books all written in code and a secret society of people that come in at random times and borrow one of the said books.<br /><br />\\"...this is exactly the kind of store that makes you want to buy a book about a teenage wizard. This is the kind of store that makes you want to be a teenage wizard.\\"<br /><br />The M.C. Clay finds most things about the bookstore odd including the enigmatic owner of the shop Mr. Penumbra.  He rarely sells anything and wonders how the bookstore could possibly stay in business after taking the graveyard shift of the store.  Clay gets drawn into the mystery of the coded books and with the help of Kat a girl he meet who works at Google and Neel his childhood friend they go on a quest of sorts to solve the mystery of the secret society.<br /><br />\\"Why does the typical adventuring group consist of a wizard, a warrior, and a rogue, anyway? It should really be a wizard, a warrior, and a rich guy. Otherwise who's going to pay for all the swords and spells and hotel rooms?\\"<br /><br />I was drawn into the quirky mystery of the story right away.  I love puzzles and codes and everything about this story drew me in a little more.  There is also a cute little romance between Clay and Kat.  Clay is kinda a geeky programmer and Kat is a Googler their interactions are extremely cute but not overly romantic like the beginning of a real relationship.<br /><br />\\"Then: I google \\"time-series visualization\\" and start work on a new version of my model, thinking that maybe I can impress her with a prototype. I am really into the kind of girl you can impress with a prototype.\\"<br /><br />I enjoyed the dialog of the entire book and really liked Clay and all of his friends.  I would say that the only weak point in the entire story is the wrap up of the mystery.  After everyone else failed, the secret society and an entire team at Google, Clay figures it all out all by himself.  But all and all this is entertaining, fun and different than many of the other things I've read lately.  I totally liked the epilogue though that thoroughly lets us know what happens to all the characters in the book in the future.<br /><br />This is one of the better stand-alone books I've read.  So if you are looking for something that is quick, fun, interesting and you don't have to commit to 3-7 books to get through I would totally recommend checking it out.of his friends.

B002ZG9846|5.0|I like the combo pack that you get. I enjoyed it very much. It was hardcore something I didnt expect

B004LWZW24|5.0|If horror movies are what you like then you will enjoy this one. This is one scary movie that leaves you thinking
0307591549|3.0|The already heard lectures on PBS and Youtube say it all.  There is nothing more of substance in the book.  Very enjoyable for someone who has yet to be introduced to the &#34;mind over matter&#34; concepts.
B00F5FBE82|5.0|The whole album is off the hook drake has done it again he could not done any better now his just making me ready for his next album. But every song on here is a must listen to like wuatang, too much, come thru, so i just really think drake out done himself again i like take care, his first album  and now this album just topped that one so i really cant wait till his album. Drake that man for real. Even tho thats not really what i wanted to say just keeping it professional on here.
B002GJI76W|1.0|it was some weird format of dvd that would not play in this zone.  I want a refund of my money
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I am not unbiased.  I LOVE Stephen King.  I've read EVERYTHING he has ever written and loved it ALL.  This is number three on my top ten list, with The Dark Tower Series being consider one and not many.  This book is compelling for all those who wondered over the years whatever happened to Danny Torrence and Redrum.  Gripping and spellbinding are great ways to describe it. I had to read it twice.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|VERY FUN GAME.  Have been enjoying for a couple of days now and it is my go to GAME for relaxation.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|He saved his money up and got it for his birthday.  It took 3 days for us to build it and he did about a third.  It's been two months and he still plays with it.
0920668372|5.0|Every child should have a book like this.  I bought one for my 40th son and my 20th grandchild.  They both had tears when they read it as same as I did.  A great child or adult book.
0525952926|5.0|Ken Follett is probably the best story teller around.<br />It's hard to wait until the fall of 2014 for the third book!<br />Follet's work is always a great read.
B004KKX80A|3.0|The blade is excelent, my kid loves the little guy and actually wins a lot of battles.<br /><br />The down side is that the FD part was damaged very quickly, the screw is loosen because the threads of the FD looks like wore out or god damaged too fast, and that was like maybe 2 weeks after purchased.<br /><br />So now although he plays with it, it is loosen and sometime the thing just splits into pieces when battling. I will have to order the FD cause as it is it can hurt someone when the small pieces go flying out of the stadium.
1564148793|5.0|this is a great read filled with info , not for the starter witch or the fluffy bunny hearted, knowing your enemy , and how to protect your self , every true witch should own this book , plain and easy to read
B0057URWSQ|4.0|I really enjoyed the pilot show but as I began to watch the show, I started to hear so much profanity and especially the use of GD in every other sentence that it became offensive to my ears.  I began to wonder why such a tight story line would need such offensive language to drive home a point.  Not sure why such intelligent charters would need profanity to express themselves because it really doesn't add up for me.  If I could change one thing in the show it would be to remove the profanity because it seems out of place in a corporate setting and flat out unprofessional for such a polished group of actors.  Season 1 is great but season 2 and 3 really have lost the wit of season 1.
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|Lots of fun.... Not enough levels. I had so much fun that I burned through all the levels in a few hours. Wish there was more
B00BB8OHMW|5.0|A beautiful movie, that I hadn't seen for years. One of the most romantic movies ever.  It played great on my kindle.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Does anyone not love our rumpled Columbo played by Peter Falk?  &#34;Ah, just a minute&#34;, as he turns while heading out the door. Such a good series plus movies in a boxed set.  I believe this was a Deal of the Day awhile back when I jumped at it and am not sorry.
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|Excellent read. Entertaining, informative, a page-turner. Bill's grasp of the interesting is firmly demonstrated here. I'm heading to Australia soon and found it very helpful. Although I'm now a bit nervous about swimming at the Great Barrier Reef!
B00B52FDXQ|4.0|If you enjoyed the first two seasons, the third and final season maintains the standard and ends with a fittingly epic finale.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It was easy to install and offers me the option of watching YouTube videos on my big screen. I can control it with my cellphone, just as advertised.  I now look forward to more companies streaming their material through chromecast.
B00646UU5Y|5.0|I love prime val but i i do wonder what happened next after it ended.Put i liked the action in this seasion and all of them
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I've swapped mice a lot, looking for what suits me best. I've used everything from the old Microsoft Intellimouse to trackballs and everything in between, including high-end razer gaming mice. This one blows them all out of the water. The buttons are great and easy to reach, I can change the sensitivity on the fly without having to do weird finger contortions (I had this issue with some mice), and the price point is more or less impossible to beat.<br /><br />I had never heard of Anker before buying this mouse, but now that I have used their mouse, I'm probably going to stick with them forever. I highly recommend giving them a try, and even if you're unhappy with your purchase, it's only $40!
B000001DTM|5.0|U2's first of four albums to show their artistic chops. Bono's lyrics are in peak-form. Zooropa, Passengers and Pop are just as inventive, just as brilliant, but unfortunately under-appreciated albums because they lack the hit singles. I think future generations, who will have no preconceptions of who or what U2 should be, will look back and consider these four albums to be U2 at their creative best.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|I am 24 and I died laughing !! I went and bought it right after!!! AMAZING! The whole family will enjoy.
B000001E18|5.0|U2 at its artistic peak. Zooropa is bold, free-flowing electronic journey, dazzling and subtle, brilliant. In the 1990's they became a great art band. Achtung Baby, Zooropa, Passengers and Pop are U2 as artists first, number one rock band in the world, second.
B00F35B8F8|3.0|It was a rainy day, we enjoyed the first one & thought let's give it a try.  The movie was just OK.  Nothing special.
B000001EAQ|5.0|When U2 was at their creative peak, the 1990's, they created new sounds/ depth, in Achtung Baby, Zooropa, Passengers, and Pop. The last two being their boldest. The 1990's is U2 art.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|If is really cool and funny.But there is a problem<br />On the plane game you cant blow.But theres a setting in the game that you can turn off that game if you want.otherwise its really cool
B000001E8S|5.0|The 1990's were U2 in top artistic form with Achtung Baby, Zooropa, Passengers, and Pop. This album is the most experimental of the four. Hearing this, U2 could have went the direction of art band, perhaps landing somewhere between Pink Floyd and Radiohead.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Uninstalled and reinstalled over and over several times... still not working. So inconvenient since I can't always take my laptop everywhere... I'm waiting for my Galaxy tablet and this app keeps crashing on my android smartphone which it's software is up to date.
B00E7SXPVW|4.0|In Utero by Nirvana is my personal favorite album of all time. It truly changed my life and taste in music. The remastered version of the original album is great. Sounds louder and crisper. I was also glad they included the original mixes of Heart Shaped Box and All Apologies as additional tracks. It's just interesting to hear how it was originally intended, but I actually prefer the album versions. Maybe it's just nostalgia.<br /><br />The reason I give it 4 and not 5 stars in because of the second disc. The new \\"2013\\" mixes on that disc seem unnecessary.  It's almost like \\"Let it Be: Naked.\\" Using alternate takes for the songs is interesting, but only to listen once. They also remixed the B-Sides which is annoying. Why not include the original mix for the B-Sides as well as the new mixes?<br /><br />If you are not interested in the 2013 mix I would suggest you get the regular album and not the two disc.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|Weak movie with bad acting and terrible plot. It was a waste of my time to watch this boring movie.
B00DD1X99C|2.0|A double album with only 17 songs? That's less than five songs per side. With the over-priced expense of the vinyl, RCA could have added more songs, or charge less for the vinyl. Also, no historic background on the recordings was included. I got more information from a Rolling Stone review. Very cheaply handled. I liked the tunes - didn't like being taken. The CDs are a much greater value.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|My husband had been looking for this kit. I found it and bought for him. He loves it and uses all the time.
B007BLCGNU|2.0|Just not for me at all.  There are things in the movie that are not suitable for my Christian beliefs and against what God says.  Had I known beforehand, I would not have watched it.  PERIOD!  If you don't mind 2 men kissing, then go for it.
B00FN8FCO8|4.0|They've almost got it back. The less JDevil shows up, the better it gets. This album is a pretty good comeback for Head. The depth they were missing with his guitar playing is back. Unfortunately the electronics, even though less than before, tend to cover up Fieldy's bass skills, and also takes away from the drums. Hopefully the next one will be all Korn and Jonathan Davis separates Korn from JDevil.
B008IGP8QE|5.0|My kids love austin and alley so I surprised them with the cd. They love hearing all their favorite songs that they had heard on the show!
B001NLKZUA|3.0|Good story but not super unique.  Can't someone find a way to leave out vampires and werewolves? It's like the &#34;go to&#34; fictional character and it's starting to get old.
B0040ZA2D6|5.0|My kids love btr's show and all their songs so I bought the cd and we can enjoy the songs anytime!
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Very, very good!  I can't wait for Amazon to put on season 5.  This is a very good series!  I definitely recommend.
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|It's fun, but the version I loaded onto my KIndle Fire has some quirks. The &#34;Moose&#34; challenge only accepts two fingers, meaning if the Moose gets more than two bullet holes, the Moose is dead. The &#34;Tipping&#34; challenge is almost impossible and hard to figure out what the strategy is so it seems really random. The &#34;Vomit&#34; challenge sometimes does not recognize that I am wiping the screen with my fingers. I wipe. Nothing. Same thing with the fork in the toaster. I  put my finger on the screen where I am supposed to and nothing. I still managed to get 2000+ score when I was lucky and didn't get too many of these quirky challenges...or the impossible Moose challenge. I turned off the airplane because the Kindle doesn't register blowing on the screen.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|I am really enjoying this game, and can't put my Kindle Fire, down.  I still haven't figured out the use of tools and achievements. Cool graphics.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Robert Plant is amazing at, what, 60? Jason Bonham is John Bonham reincarnated...chilling. John Paul has only gotten better. Jimmy Page is a little rough. This is a MUST for Zeppelin fans.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Not at all what the hype made it out to be... Very shallow ... Hope the characters develop in the rest of the series
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan did a wonderful job writing this book and at the end he leaves us in suspene on what is going to happen. I would recommend this book to anybody who wants to read a well written book and exciting book.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This is a good book. I like Rick Rioirdans books they are good books. You should buy le book. Buy the book. Why are you still here. Go buy the book. Oh, I see, not listening. YOU ARE SILL HERE. GO BUY THE BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this is one of my favorite apps, right behind Candy Crush Saga (so addicting).  I love that everything I find on the web has a place to go and great reminders, love it!
B00F91G5BS|4.0|Finally someone made a zombie movie that looked very real. It also showed me how stupid nerdy scientists can be out in the field.
B00B4FU6KE|4.0|Well written, an unusual story line, but captivating.  You end up caring about both characters and wondering about the soundness of the parents.
B00FFRAKRG|5.0|After the departure of Brian \\"Head\\" Welch in 2004, Korn's sound began to undergo several changes in rapid succession, from the industrial pop that dominated 'See You on the Other Side' and the atmospheric scope of 'Untitled' to their \\"back-to-basics\\" riffage of 'Remember Who You Are' and the dubstep-infused 'Path of Totality'. Even if fans didn't take to one approach or another, the aforementioned albums were admirable because they demonstrated the level of commitment that Korn has always possessed. These guys take their music very seriously, even if it alienates a few listeners along the way.<br /><br />The band's last album ('Path of Totality') was pretty good, but it didn't feel like Korn. The dubstep influences cancelled out many of the organic elements that have characterized the band's trademark sound for years, so in a lot of ways, the only thing that stood out was Jonathan Davis' voice...but Korn is more than just Jonathan Davis. 'The Paradigm Shift', Korn's 11th, is a special outing because it features the return of Head, a strange occurrence given that Davis lashed out at him on not one but two albums since his initial departure. Unless David Silvera returns (which seems highly unlikely), this album is the closest we'll get to hearing the original line-up again, and that gives 'Paradigm Shift' a great advantage from the get-go.<br /><br />When you listen to this record from start-to-finish, it's immediately clear that Head's return is the shot in the arm that Korn has needed for some time now. Every song is relentless and bursting with life; the face-melting riffs and wicked bass-lines mix seamlessly with all of the melodic and electronic elements the band tinkered with in the wake of Head's departure. The album doesn't get bogged down in filler; once you put it on, the music just blasts through its run-time and dares you to hit 'repeat'...and trust me, you will. I hate to say I wasn't expecting much from this record, but it totally blindsided me. For those who believe that Korn lost its edge 10 years ago, 'The Paradigm Shift' is an ass-kicking reaffirmation.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I had never seen the show previously and could not get enough.  I loved the story line -- it captivated me so much I watched season one, two and three back to back one after the other and now I am waiting on pins and needles for season four!
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|Just get it. You'll understand why.<br /><br />Great gameplay, great graphics, and the hook? It manages to be both funny and challenging without overdoing it.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I have not watched the series so I do not know how the book compares. But if you are into the age of Kings, Queens, Knights, etc... And all the violence that comes with it, then you won't be dissointed.  This is a pure fantasy novel though. It involves things like dragons and sorcery, so don't expect to learn anything.  Like the title of this review states, it's a good escape. So if you want a book to dive into to just get away, this one is fun.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is increasingly challenging when you get to higher levels. This game is very addicting and fun. I love it!
B009LDCZ7I|4.0|Not as good as season one but still very entertaining. Less pornagraphic sex scens and that was a big plus for me.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Can't wait for the movie to come out. Card is an excellent writer, great detail and imagination. Second time reading this.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I loved this movie exciting without gratuitous sex and graphic violence. I enjoy Chris Pine. The rest of the cast melds well with the original story
B000PUV1ZI|5.0|Expresses the joys of parenthood like no other movie. The best movie to watch to remind yourself what is important during those times when you realize you have put your job ahead of your family. The emotions expressed by the actors are so genuine I cry everytime I watch it.
B007SGM084|4.0|Eye opening and once I had got over the initial shock of all of his deviations I rather enjoyed the book and its conclusion.
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|I'm not big into games on my various devices, but I do like to play around with the Angry Bird games on my Kindle Fire during brief downtimes. The Star Wars game is just a variation on the theme, but there are some neat weapons to help conquer the piggish bad guys. I'm not into buying more weapons or anything like that, so I don't use that feature. The game is fun to play without such things. And it is always rewarding when you get enough points to earn all three stars in a particular battle. I played around with the free version for a couple weeks and think it is worth purchasing the full-blown game for only 99 cents, which I did!
0062255657|4.0|Even though it was less than a 150 page book, it was still a great story.  I was very pleased with the order, time it delivered and the condition it was in! I am truly grateful for Amazon and their products.  Thank you!
B00FOQRNLE|5.0|Don't read this book if you are looking for a PhD to discuss their scientific research. This isn't that kind of book. Don't forget, Gladwell is a writer who provokes you to think. He accomplishes that with his amazing style and great story telling ability. I couldn't put it down.
B00BWYFTNG|3.0|Fun: 2: You can play with it but most folks are going to just display him. Which is cool.<br />Education: 1: Absolutely nothing past hand eye coordination is educational.. and I guess pop culture knowledge?<br />Durable: 3: Not as solid as the classic cool McF toys.<br />Overall: 3: Merle is a great Rooker lookalike, but seriously this Norman reissue? Total crap on the likeness. Folks are 5 starring it because it's Dixon brothers or Daryl, but seriously, this is not a 5 star thing to own and suffers greatly at no new head for Daryl. Wait around for the tall Daryl or a wave with that Daryl's rescult when he'll look perfect.<br />Total waste.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|great price, great product. this is much cheaper when I saw at Walmart. I love it and i think it worth the money
B005544TRQ|5.0|The characters, The story, Direction all seems well done and its classy. The best part is that all the stories are solved as they would in real life which has to be credited to the writer.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show! Such good actors. It is a interesting and addicting series. I highly recommend it. I can't wait for another season!
B004T4KKSA|5.0|Great book that shows how oil has impacted the world since it was discovered in Pennsylvania in the 1880s.  Recommended for anyone trying to understand the geopolitical energy world we live in today.
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|Bought this for my Wife, then coincidentally we were able to see him live in concert.. He has amazing energy, and is a very positive person, His music reflects his attitude. you will totally enjoy listening to this.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book! The book has you spellbound cover to cover wishing you were Anastasia. I Would love another book by E.l.
B009IRVSVQ|3.0|Amazing voice and voice control, very talented.. sometimes she sounds like Michael Jackson, other times he sounds like Rod Stewart.For me, most of the music is \\" youth\\" inspired, odd subject matter. There are two songs worthy of repeat listening. I suggest that you listen to sample tracks and buy the ones that you like instead of purchasing the entire Cd.
B001D57C0C|5.0|Within Temptation has come a long way. I love the instruments in the background and the vocals are strong.  Better than Mother Earth in my opinion.
B00FN811SY|5.0|for all those with kindle fire like me you can download it using the 1 mobile market app. i don't have sny problems using it. thanks to the faithful and discreet slave for this app.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Great little calculator. I have used it many times for quick basic calculations. It is free so it's the right price.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|This story casts a tame light on prison life.  The writer not only looks at herself as a victim but, many others on the inside.  The title of the book is what drew me to purchase it.  I thought this could be a book about someone who lived a very nice existence and then coped with the situation through humor. I was wrong.  Just another bleeding heart liberal essay.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|So disappointed as I really enjoy Moriarty's novels. Plot was predictable and uninspired. Characters were poorly developed. Nothing rang true in this neatly tied together, unrealistic novel.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I almost stopped reading after the first 100 pages.  There were so many characters and it was hard to follow what their stories had to do with one another.  It was mid book before the characters were finally starting to come together that made it an interesting read.  About 2/3's into the book, I had to continue reading until it was done.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I had never heard of this show until I had read and article in WIred magazine about it. I decided to give it a try and I'm glad I did. I'm about half way through the first season. Highly recommend giving it a try!
B00AREIAI8|1.0|This would have been a 5-star game but for the constant, annoying ads that start popping up once you're about 15 levels in.  Not quite sure what the game designers are trying to accomplish by ruining the game with these silly ads - it hasn't convinced me to purchase their other games and in fact has convinced me to stop playing this game.  It's a completely asinine and ineffective marketing ploy.  If I could give this game 0 stars, I would.
B0057UAE54|5.0|I remember buying this album when it was first released. It's hard to believe it is really 35 years old. After buying it I was listening to it on my commute home on my iPhone and realized just how different it was from the first time listening to it in my car... on my 8-track.. through my Jensen 6x9 speakers... when Frampton and I both had hair. My how things have changed... It's great to know that classic albums like this are better than ever!! This is a must own for any child of the 70's. If you are even remotely considering buying this album, do it! You will not regret it!
B00FAXLCWW|5.0|Fun.  Danceable.  Different enough from track to track to not get monotonous but cohesive as an album to set a mood.  Personal favorites: Don't Save Me, If I could Change Your Mind, and the very different My Song 5.  Heard about this release on NPR and had to get it.
B001OKGX92|5.0|A classic that never gets old. The perfect example of why McQueen was known as the &#34;King of Cool&#34;. Worth the price just for the car chase scene.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love it. Better than alot of the games that were not free. They update with new runs all the time.
B00FN811SY|5.0|This is an application that I can't get on my kindle hd, but I want it. Please add this application to the kindle hd
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I liked this game very much.  It was a great exercise for the brain.  Looking forward to more levels to come soon.
B00EO10M54|5.0|I'll admit that when I first pre-ordered this album, I was kind of worried. Because I hated We Can't Stop and that's the first Miley song I've ever truly hated before. But I gave her the benefit of the doubt because I've loved all her albums up until now, and if there's one thing I've learned over the years, often times the first single is the worst song on the album.<br /><br />That theory was proven right when I listened to the album.<br /><br />As a whole, I don't find the INSTANT super-love for this album like I did with CBT, but I do like it. And I'm sure I'll love it the more I listen to it. After all, the best albums are the growers (to me at least).<br /><br />If you're still one of the few people that's looking for child-appropriate music from Miley Cyrus, you're not gonna find any here. Although I'm not really sure why anybody would after the Can't Be Tamed era. But anyway.<br /><br />The album starts out with a sweet, slow song called \\"Adore You\\". It's about Miley telling someone that no matter how much they love her, she loves them more.<br /><br />The next track on the album is \\"We Can't Stop\\". I'm pretty sure you all have heard it by now. If you haven't, consider yourself lucky. She has much better tracks on this album than that one.<br /><br />\\"SMS (Bangerz)\\", a duet with Britney Spears, comes afterwards. This song is an acquired taste for many people - you either like it or you don't. I personally like it, but I might be slightly biased because I've been wanting a Britney/Miley duet ever since I first got into Britney. It's a really fun song that puts me in a good mood and makes me feel very confident.<br /><br />\\"4x4\\", a duet with Nelly, is another one that many people's opinions are divided on. I think it's good, other than that one line (and you'll KNOW which one I'm talking about when you listen to it). This is the song on the album I think is the most routed in country music, although it may still be something hard for country fans with a dislike for pop to get into.<br /><br />\\"My Darlin' (feat. Future)\\" is another very sweet and slow song. Very relaxing in my opinion. Just the song you need to calm you down.<br /><br />\\"Wrecking Ball\\" - Again, I'm sure you all have heard this one by now, judging by the huge controversy over the music video. If you haven't though, you should (listen to the song, I mean). It's a very sad song that I can tell Miley put a lot of her heart into. You can almost hear her crying during parts of it.<br /><br />\\"Love Money Party (feat. Big Sean)\\" is probably my 2nd least favorite song on the album. It's not that it's TERRIBLE by any means. The lyrics just don't go with the tune very well in my opinion. Maybe if it had a different tune I'd like it better.<br /><br />\\"#Getitright\\" is up next. This is for sure one of the fan favorites on the album. She starts out the song by whistling. It's definitely one of her most explicit songs yet, as far as the subject matter goes. Telling the person she's singing to, \\"don't you think it's time to get it on?\\" Definitely a song to be listened to in private.<br /><br />\\"Drive\\" is another ballad. Very powerful lyrics. One of my favorites for sure.<br /><br />The next song, however, is a very midtempo song. Sung mainly in acronyms, it's telling this person to back the heck off because she saw what was on your phone. It's a duet with French Montana. Miley really seems to have a lot of duets on this album.<br /><br />After that, \\"Do My Thang\\" comes on. This song a lot of Miley fans are praising, but personally I don't think it lives up to the hype. It's OKAY, but not that great in my opinion.<br /><br />\\"Maybe You're Right\\" is probably one of the most powerful ballads on the album, next to \\"Wrecking Ball\\". The way she sings this song, you can tell it means a lot to her.<br /><br />\\"Someone Else\\" - Again, another really amazing ballad. Her ballads are definitely the highlight of this album in my opinion.<br /><br />The bonus tracks (Rooting For My Baby, On My Own, and Hands In The Air (feat. Ludacris)) are probably my favorite songs on the album. I don't wanna review them individually though because I have a feeling it'll be getting really repetitive.<br /><br />All in all, an amazing album. I'm not sure yet if I love it more or less than her previous albums, but the more I listen to it, I'll figure it out. Definitely a grower.<br /><br />Don't judge the album on \\"We Can't Stop\\". The rest of the songs are nothing like it in my opinion. And even if you don't like Miley the person right now, try giving Miley the artist a try. You may be surprised with what you find.y, On My Own, and Hands In The Air (feat. Ludacris)) are probably my favorite songs on the album. I don't wanna review them individually though because I have a feeling it'll be getting really repetitive.<br /><br />All in all, an amazing album.

0345803507|5.0|I was sad when the series ended cause I wanted it to keep on going and going. One of the best book series I have read in a long time.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This book explores magical events through the eyes of a child and you could almost say they truly happened. A captivating well-narrated story. At times scary, but beautifully magical.
0345803493|5.0|I loved the whole series and never wanted it to end. Since finishing it I have passed it on to other friends who love it as well.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is a fantastic movie that I am revisiting because my kids are discovering some of my old favorites.  Some of the early scenes were frightening for our 3 year old, though, so I had to leave the room with him while everyone else (7 and up) enjoyed it greatly.
1416972250|5.0|Theses books have been great so far. I really enjoyed the first one and decided that I needed the next two as well. Amazon had a way better price then the stores I had looked for the books at.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|It was interesting read, but lacked the consistent feel of day .1. Ending was a non-event and reduces any excitement for the next sequel
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|I thought it was a great movie. This is a movie I would choose for family movie night. Definitely more for a family night with the kids.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I have Apple TV, Roku's and a Mac Mini and an OG Logitech Google TV.  Not super impressed with this one.  Right now it's limited.  Plus if you Cast a Chrome Tab, be prepared for to peg your host CPU out!  I have a 2012 MacBook Pro with Retina Display that has 16 GB of RAM and the 2.7 GHz Intel Core i7 special order CPU and my fans sound like a C17 taking off when I cast a Chrome Tab.  But I will say it's easy once it's up and running.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Connelly knocked this one out of the park!! Harry Bosch and Mickey Ballet together...WONDERFUL.  Excellent story line and superbly written.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love the weather channel because I can still keep an eye on my adult children who are in different parts of the USA.  Every morning I check the weather in each of their areas, so I know what is going on for them.  So, the weather channel makes me feel closer to to my kids and grandkids.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Could not put the book down. I think it has a pretty nice plot. Well hero wins, and story does not bring in many potential complications of real life. But lot of imagination in the book.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I read this book when it came out, and absolutely loved it. Reading it a second time, to get re acquainted with what was going on, it was still just as great. Anyone that's ever had any interest in Greek/Roman history, I recommend this whole series.
0060989157|5.0|Great book on the career of one of the most notorious bands and the lives of the bandmembers. It gives you a deeper look at what all has happened in their 30 years.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Everything in this game has been fantastic so far I can't wait till I have enough gems for a unicorn.
1426308469|5.0|Perfect first dinosaur book! I bought this for my nephew's 5th birthday. I was really surprised! I would pay more money for this book. The quality of the paper, the colors, the pictures... I mean everything about this book is GREAT! I recommend purchasing this book. Overall 5 stars -- Shipped really quick and in brand new condition. It's a good size book too.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|Who can't like the Goonies? Adventure. laughs and surprising, frollicky fun! It is an entertainingly great movie from beginning to end.
B00CTT9646|5.0|Awesome!!! Love the move and the set is fantastic. A must have for any serious collector or a big fan.
B009AMAGQM|3.0|VERY GOOD BOOKS, NOT SO GREAT OF A MOVIE-MISSING CHARACTERS AND PLOTLINES-BASICALLY CUT OUT MOST OF THE PARTS IN THE BOOKS THAT GRAB YOU AND DON'T LET GO.  I READ THE FIRST BOOK AND HAD A VERY HARD TIME PUTTING IT DOWN AND RECENTLY JUST STARTED THE SECOND BOOK(WHICH IS REALLY GOOD, i CANNOT WAIT TO FINISH THE SERIES NOW, EXCEPT I'M NOT SURE THAT I WANT IT TO END!)
B000TDGGRY|5.0|I enjoy his works. Can't wait to read his next. Ten more words required. Ten more words required.That is it!
044655667X|5.0|Classic Michael Connelly courtroom stuff.  I follow the Lincoln Lawyer wherever he goes.  And loved the small dig about who would play him in the movie...
B00594XOZU|5.0|It keeps saying that I have no connection and I do. It's been doing this for two weeks now! Fix it please :(  but when it works I like the app
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love temple run two it is a amazing game. It is also really creative.<br />This is a perfesional game and I think everybody should get it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Awesome<br />This book is awesome so surprising at the end ok I need 10  more words in ok ok ok ok
B009WO7NQO|5.0|this is awesome  you have 2 amazing things angry birds and star wars and you put them together  totally is awesome like  putting  chocolat and peanutbutter together
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|The ads really ruin the game.  It cuts out at all moments and barages you with ads.  I can see having some ads, but this was ridiculous
B00AWJYJVA|4.0|As always John LeCarre creates characters worth caring for as he tells their convoluted tales in smooth and polished prose.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was very well written book!! It kept me wanting to continue reading! I was really surprised that I kept wanting to continue reading it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A book that gets your attention right from the start. It is a story that makes you start thinking what would you do as a parent if that was your son. I would recommend to to everyone. Well written story.
B0012QRPU4|4.0|What can you say?<br />This whole series is so creative and so unique it almost creates a new frontier<br />Congratulations!
B00023B1LC|5.0|An Excellent movie. And the hole series is fantastic. A must have for anyone who likes spy type movies. This has the action you've come to expect from this type of movie.
0061950726|1.0|This was not at all what I was expecting.  I thought it was the story of the original Orphan Train that crossed this country during the depression.  It had nothing to do with that.  After reading the first couple  of chapters, I threw it in the trash can!  It was very dark & depressing.  Hate that I wasted my money!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|You all know about it. Just do it. Don't wait till you need it and have to take time when you don't have it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|After watching the first couple of episodes, we were hooked and couldn't quit watching all three seasons until we had seen them all.  Love the time period it is set, the characters, costumes & story line.  Can't wait for the next season!
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|First time I understood the plot so clearly. Pretty people, lots ot look at. Fun updated music to listen to.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book was a good vacation read, although the plot was easy to figure out from the beginning. I enjoyed the characters and each of their personalities.
B0089EHWQE|3.0|This is a strange romance but it keeps the reader interested.  No tears but not a Hollywood ending either.  The characters seem a bit contrived but it works in the end.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I have enjoyed this game for awhile now.  Multiple classes and a detailed customization system makes the replay ability pretty good.  PVP is active and for the most part balanced, some classes do have a distinct advantage at higher levels. Solo gameplay is entertaining and engaging.<br /><br />Only thing I can say that keeps me from putting a 5th star is no chat system other than in a instance room waiting for players.  Often times most people are in such a hurry to just play the chat room is rarely used.  If I could have a say in a future update it would be a permanent chat room.
B006O7XOOW|1.0|I bought this for our 8 month old who is starting to pull up.  There's no way for him to pull up on this without it tipping over onto him.  I even put my husband's dive weights into the legs (where the balls are supposed to drop) and even that didn't help.  And it's boring.  It was an impulse buy and off to Goodwill it goes.
B001VEE5KK|4.0|This is an interesting story. It has a lot of in depth thinking behind. If you get past the sex which wasn't bad you can see a real story there. Where she learned to read through what the boy told her and what she picked up in prison. Yes I was very impressed with this book
B00742H26M|3.0|I did not have the closed caption on for some reason, and I had difficulty understanding the English. I enjoyed Fanny, but the story line was very similar to her other works.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I can't stop playing!!! I just wish my kindle would give me all the updates. Aside from that it's very fun.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Castle is a show we have enjoyed watching with our teenage girls - just enough romance for them and enough action for us.  It's a kin to the old show Moonlighting that I used to watch as a teen.  We're having a good time with it.
0142407380|5.0|Anthony Horowitz has created the ideal action/adventure series for teens. The main character, Alex Rider, is essentially the teenage rendition of James Bond. Forced to work for MI6 after his uncle's assassination, Alex learns to use his new, outlandish spy gear to survive in the chaotic world of espionage. In Ark Angel, Anthony Horowitz successfully resurrects the cliffhanger from the end of his previous novel Scorpia, as Alex is brought back from a near death encounter with a deadly assassin. Alex's spy skills are brought to the ultimate test when he has to save the Pentagon, and Washington D.C. as a whole, from utter destruction. As with the other books in the series, I really enjoyed the action and adventures Alex experiences, and I also enjoy the descriptive scenes that allowed me to immerse myself into the story and experience the book, virtually as a movie inside my head. Yes it is that descriptive and enjoyable. If you are looking for an action/adventure novel or another enjoyable read from Anthony Horowitz's Alex Rider series, this book is above par.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I bought a Kindle Fire for my grandson's birthday, last year, when he turned six.  He enjoys playing video games and he especially likes anything Spider-man, so I purchased this game for him this week.  He says it is great and he would recommend it to all of his friends.
0060574216|5.0|Would recommend this to anyone. Learned more from this book than many others combined. I will take this knowledge and apply it not just to personal relationships but business and family alike!!!! MUST READ!!!
B000HF2NTE|3.0|It's a so, so movie. I watched it one, but once is about the many times I will watch it...
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|As something of a Seiko aficionado, it is only appropriate that I write a quick review on the SKX007K. This watch is a fine specimen of the Seiko breed. Durability, utility, quality all are abundant in this watch. My example has excellent time-keeping for its type (7S26), runs approx. + 1 min per week. The dial is similar to the usual Seiko diver, with the exception of the second hand, which has a relocated lume pip from the pointer end to the back end. It is this location that is my primary complaint in terms of legibility, other Seiko diver models are more legible simply because of their superior second-hand lume location. The build quality is as solid as any watch I have ever handled. The water resistance is entirely adequate for all activities I have used it for (incl. ocean snorkeling). The lume is excellent and readable at any hour of the night.<br /><br />This watch is a fine continuation of all the other Seiko divers and movements I have owned (6105s, 6309s, 7002s, and other 7S26s). My grandfather owned an early 7002 as the successor to his Omega Speedmaster and found the Seiko's reliability and longevity to be superior to that of the Omega over a nearly 30 year span. If you are in the market for a high quality watch that will last as long as you do, (nearly) I recommend this watch, the SKX007K.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Seeing as how I've never read a comic book, this review will focus on the movie itself and not what devoted comic book fans feel that it should've been-<br />For me, Zack Snyder hit it out of the ball park, homerun! I can't imagine a better cast for each of the characters. Not to disrespect the old Superman movies (RIP Christopher Reeve), but this was a breath of fresh air.<br />As I mentioned before, I haven't read comic books and a majority of the people I know haven't read them either, so it was a relief when the movie portrayed certain details about Superman that were a mystery to me: why kryptonite makes him weak, why he has super powers, and the specifics of why he's here on earth. A while back I kinda got bored of watching Lex Luthor get trashed rather easily in all the other movies, so it was nice to see a villain that could actually stand toe to toe with Superman.<br />Bottom line, this was a great movie if you haven't read the comic books. I highly recommend it!<br />I will list my top 5 favorite movies so you can see if my recommendation would share your same interest:<br />1. The Dark Knight<br />2. Warrior<br />3. Sherlock Holmes (1st one with Robert Downey Jr.)<br />4. Super 8<br />5. Wreck It Ralph
B005HP2JAM|3.0|If your into cave art you may enjoy this, but be prepared for a lot of repetition, it was a 30 minute film stretched out to 2 hours for some reason and poorly edited. I found it to be better by running duplicate scenes at high speed. The price was right and the old saying is definitely right, different strokes for different folks.  All in all I thought it was worth the money.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|This is one of the best games ever and it is the best game Rovio has made yet. I can't wait for the update.
B00FFL8ZMY|5.0|Fortress is exactly that. You thought good music was dead? Well this is proof it isn't. Bands like Alter Bridge don't come along anymore, so pick up this album, because it's a one in a million type of album. Absolutely exquisite songwriting we've come to expect and love from these guys.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I've never played it before now .I love that game & thank you for letting me play for FREE .
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Great performance by Mr Denzel Washington. Could ask for a better performance from him. No wonder he got an Oscar nod.
B003HKN52U|5.0|Great movie. Big fan of Tom Cruise.<br />I can watch it over and over.<br />Glad I added it to my collection.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|I have this on my Kindle Fire HD and didn't have any problems.  Very easy to navigate, great graphics.  The hint option takes you to your next task, no scrolling around.  The only downside is it's not long enough. Fun game!
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great Series....I so hope the new season is more explosive then last season...Can she trust Cary not to backstab her?

B0035HKWLW|5.0|I watched this this movie again because its been a long time since I've seen it. It was funny as hell. Jim Carey is truly talented. If you haven't seen it, or seen it lately. Get this movie. It's free for people that have Amazon Prime. Sure the movie's premise and plot I<br /> Are corny, but then again, its Jim carrey.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Amazing season! Still cannot believe I'm in love with a PBS show but in love I am without a doubt
B004XZR63M|5.0|I had this book on my reading list for a while and after a recent recommendation I read it. It has changed some very fundemental things about the way I view wealth creation and how I will get closer to my life dreams. Thank you so much Mr Kiyosaki.

B003ODIZL6|4.0|This book is great for people who need help and this is free and a lot of book or money.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Fascinating analysis of when is an advantage NOT an advantage, and when is a weakness a strength.  After reading What the Dog Saw, I make sure not to miss any of Malcolm Gladwell's books. I know I will be driving my friends crazy talking about them for months after. Sucks to be them.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I've heard about kik one day, so I mad one. I made it on my iPad and been using it on the iPad for months. But when I heard it was on kindle fire, I got the app. I've had it for months... but when someone  restarted my kindle, I had to put my account in.<br /><br />When I downloaded everything I had, I went to all the apps I had so sign-in to. Wen I got to kik messenger, it would  let me log on. I thought it was weird... I thought that I put my password in wrong. I wanted to change the password, so wen I did... IT STILL DIDN'T LET ME LOG ON!!<br /><br />I tried millions of times to get on but it didn't work. I've changed my password several times too, but I still can't get on!! I've even tried to make a new account but it still not working!! The only reason I'm still trying  to log on on my kindle is because my iPad is broken. I am think to myself all the time to throw away my kindle, and get an iPad!! THIS APP SUCKS!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Story line is a bit melodramatic but that's part of the reason for watching!  The on-location setting is wonderful, costumes are fabulous, the actors/actresses are believable with their portrayals, and the plot lines keep me interested!  Love, love the series and eagerly anticipate Season 4 in the U.S.!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I'm mad cause they took money from me I was looking at the characters and it took money from me it said u unlocked tasha she is so ugly I wouldn't get her if it was the only character I won't my money the t ok lens in the game ALL back!!!!
1594202273|2.0|This is a huge book about an accident at a Titan II missile silo in Damascus, Arkansas. The accident was the product of human error (a worker dropped a wrench) not any inherent flaw in the system. The accident resulted one death but no release of radiation. In short, this was not a very important event, and given that the missiles were in service for 25 years, hardly demonstrates that they were unsafe.<br /><br />The book is poorly written and poorly organized. There is a vast quantity of trivial detail about the personal life of everyone even remotely involved in the Damascus accident. The narrative jumps around between the accident and other events in the Cold War. The book contains no really new or interesting information about nuclear history. The Damascus accident is discussed far more concisely, and with less breathless hysteria, in David Stumpf's book about the Titan II.<br /><br />I certainly cannot recommend paying $36 in order to plow through endless pages of inconsequential detail about the Damascus accident, which was not, in the grand scheme of things, a very significant event.<br /><br />Schlosser ought to stick to fast food and pot, which he presumably knows about from personal experience, and stay away from nuclear weapons, which he knows nothing about.
0140449337|5.0|It has SO many insightful and thoughtful sayings;  all relevant even for the present day;  some even more so!  Very inspiring.
B009C7JS14|5.0|This is the most beautiful weather app out there. The background is animated with a view that matches that is outside your house.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is very fun and different I give it a five I am addicted to the game
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|I Love Playing This Game But Recently Loaded It On My IPad &amp; No Longer Works On My Android. Tried Uninstalling It &amp; Reinstalling It On Both Devices Nothing Helps.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|JM is an excellent Guitar player and has the ability to write great lyrics. I really like this new album. He continues to evolve as a musician. I appreciate all of his works because you can hear him change as a person with each new release. When I run across people that are not fans claiming he is too poppy, I always suggest that they listen to &#34;Where the Light is&#34; to really appreciate his range.<br /><br />Nice work, JM!!!
B002RI98BA|5.0|I saw the movie and watched the extras in the bonus section of the DVD, and saw reference to the author and the manuscript from which the screenplay was adapted.  I don't normally read political biographies, however, intrigued, I ordered this and immersed myself in this book over a number of weeks.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Both the content about an inspiring man and leader, as well as the contrasting stories of his associates and Cabinet members were skillfully interwoven by the Doris Goodwin.  Exemplary piece of research, interpretation and depiction, well worth a read by everyone.  Thanks Doris, please keep writing.<br />Regards<br />Scott
B0012QRPU4|5.0|As my son put it, the story is something Shakespeare might have written had he been born today.<br /><br />This series takes full advantage of the cable TV media where viewing time is no longer cut into 10-15 minute segments for commercial breaks and the story in the script can cross over the weekly show. Characters are complex and identifiable to anyone.<br /><br />I started to watch because the Economist said that watching six seasons of Breaking Bad can teach as much about business and human aspects of any entrepreneurial start up, not just the meth business, as a Harvard MBA! I take recommendations by the Economist seriously. Even if you are not interested in an MBA, it is a superbly entertaining show.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a great series. I love how the characters have grown and developed through the seasons. I am really looking forward to season 4.
1416595236|5.0|This was his last book. Read them all. Must read them in sequence to enjoy the most. Unfortunately, he passed away this year.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is a beautiful and surprising love story.  It will both break and warm your heart.  The characters stayed with me for days.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  The imagery is STUNNING and its a unique story that keeps you watching to the end.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We wanted to complete season 3 of Downton Abbey before season 4 begins in January. We love the fact that Amazon is involved in video rentals. It provides another alternative for in home entertainment at a low price.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Lots of action, a nice romance, a bit of humor, and some of the great actors that you've enjoyed in other movies in the past.<br /><br />I will definitely see the sequel.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|Enjoyable movie. Good story. Did have one scene very objectionable but doesn't Hollywood always do this?  o such thing as a true family movie anymore
0307949486|5.0|Loved, loved, loved this book. I am now reading The Girl who Played with Fire...can't put it down! Almost done, can't wait to read The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I was forced to get it for my Kindle but the app works fine. How can you rate a forced &#34;purchase?&#34; It works just fine but I do resent having to go through all that I had just to buy something.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Good movie!  I've enjoyed all of the Iron Man movies so it's not hard for me to give 5 stars.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This is simply the nicest gaming mouse I've owned. I've been a Logitech fan for years and always stuck by their products, however after my M510 stopped working I decided to give Razer mice a try, after comparing the offerings I settled on getting this Anker mouse a try.<br /><br />It's like gliding on Air! It's so responsive and smooth, and the location of the buttons fit my hand perfectly without any strain or stretching to reach the side buttons. They Click so much easier than the others I've owned and fell just right! I love the customizing you can do in their software control. This is simply an Amazing mouse and so well built I bought another one for my brother, and he loves it as well!<br /><br />Nothing but good things to say about this mouse so far! I would recommend it to anyone looking for a customizable solid performing mouse!
B006TVQTHW|5.0|I love this case, its classy looking, solid and very easy to work with, my only complaint is the inside is not black.<br /><br />Cable management is a breeze, all the fans are working properly, just a well built case.<br /><br />Sorry Corsair, switching to Antec.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|These headphone were purchased to replace my Creative HS-1000 gaming headset, and WHAT an upgrade. There are so many budget headphones twice the price that don't even come close to the quality of these. I've picked up the JVC HA-RX700 as well and prefer those for everyday usage, only because they have a bit less bright highs and a more comfortable fit on my head. But I LOVE them both, they are just so great sounding that I'll stick with them for years to come!<br /><br />I only had one small gripe and that is the cord was broken internally at the tip when I bought them. I am good with repairs and soldered on a $5 RadioShack Gold replacement minijack, and all fixed!<br />I purchased another pair for my brother and they worked perfect out of the box, so not sure why this pair had that flaw.<br /><br />Aside from that they are GREAT budget headphones! and are perfect for gaming thanks to being semi-open and having a large soundstage. The bass is punchy and deep, and the highs are to the point of being piercing, a little EQ rolloff starting at 8k does wonders to even things out.<br />If you are looking for an even warmer sound with the same quality then go with the JVC HA-RX700's these are both highly recommended sub $50 headphones.
B005FVNIW6|5.0|This takes a little patience to begin with, but once you understand what's happening, then it is just a joy ride from there. Throughly enjoyed it, even though in places it can be a bit dark and unhappy. But the triumph of Ender is what it is all about.
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|It was a pretty good close to the franchise. But it did not make me &#34;laugh so hard I cried&#34; as the last two films. (Well except for the very end)
1465414444|5.0|I really like this book; I have just started to buy visual novels, guides, etc. about games that I like. This is the third one and the book is great; it does have a lot of information of Warcraft world, which brings me back many memories (I stopped playing one month after Pandarian for a massive lack of time).<br /><br />The content is very good and I would buy it twice without doubt.<br /><br />My only complaint is the packing, the box did not have enough air bags and the cover got a slight damaged but the product is awesome.
B0081336FO|4.0|I liked this spin on the Sherlock stories starting with the first season. I was a little disappointed that season one only had a small handful of episodes and then for season two to only have three was a big let down. They are all worth watching but it ends with no closure feeling unfinished.
B007CLSE8K|5.0|cheesy, but entertaining and who doesn't love Matthew Macfayden's sonorous voice?  It was worth it just to hear that voice.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I don't like this kind of game. I didn't know what it was until I downloaded it . I don't like chasing and jumpiong game
0385743564|5.0|This book was just plain old fashioned fun. The action was continuous and the characters were likable. Maybe this wasn't Sanderson's best work but I have read far worse from other writers, and to tell the truth Sandersons's so-so work is a much better read then a lot of other stuff out there ,imho.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|First, I needed this app for my Kindle Fire HD and then recently my android smartphone. First off it helped me to get access to my Kindle Fire HD camera before I recieved an update that enabled use of the camera.<br />This app gives you access to all files on the device you install it on. It is an absolute must have app.<br />. Now to  the smartphone issue, my antivirus protection was taking forever to scan. I blamed my antivirus  protection, but after installing another antivirus protection app it too stalled on this one file labeled apk. So I went in search of the file and could not find it. This is when I prayed for a solution and I soon remembered,  es file explorer. So I downloaded the app typed apk, a number of files came up. I pin pointed file ,deleted it and now my phone is up and running like normal again.<br />I definitely recommend this app for any electronic device it can be downloaded on.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|glad i read it ... watched the show first ... ... but this was good, well written ...  not &#34;my favorite&#34; book ever - but the delivery was efficient and it was worth a read
B000I9YWDO|5.0|Funniest movie ever. Pure genius. Wish they'd have made a sequel. Keep your stapler under lock and key.<br />Two more words.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|Not a fan of the franchise but had to see it after watching the museum scene where 007 meets the new Q. Some great dialogue and even better cinematography.
B009JZSC9S|4.0|it is a good show. some shows, after the first season things get weird and nonsense but this one was different. things are still exciting and making sense.
159102594X|5.0|The characters are so vivid they virtually jump off the pages, not just because of the excellent language and situations, but by the way they develop and grow.  The author has created a fascinating world.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Way better than the book.  Although the Piper popularity parade gets a little old, the characters are interesting and likable and the show always keeps me guessing.  Hope for many more seasons!
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I'm hooked on the Outlander series and this is one of the best ones.  I have a &#34;relationship&#34; with the characters and am always reading late into the night to see &#34;what happens next&#34;.  Addictive.
B005544TRQ|5.0|love watching this show.  The guys out doe each other in the situations the get in. Quite tongue and cheek.
B00BAXFCPO|4.0|I agree with the dietary recommendations in this book.  They are backed by the biochemistry and physiology provided through the research outlined, as well as information that has existed in biology textbooks for years.<br /><br />Two sections of the book, however, did not support the book's thesis (based on the title), and were the result of the typical mainstream approach of relying on flawed studies and personal biases to draw irresponsible conclusions.  One was the chapter on the restriction of calories.  In the studies performed, it is impossible to conclude that restricting calories leads to improved health.  Correlation does not equal causation.  Dr. Permutter believes (correctly IMO) that glucose restriction improves health.  So it would follow that within a sizeable group, restricting calories on people eating a standard American diet would likely proportionally restrict glucose, thereby producing a positive effect.  So was it the calories, or the glucose calories?  How about a study where only fat calories were reduced--would that have the same effect?  Again, poor to non-existent controls due to the biases of the researchers.<br /><br />The only way to prove this would be to compare two groups of people eating virtually no carbohydrates, and eating the same composition of animal foods, prepared the same way, and then assess the results of a calorie restriction.  Of course, a study like that would be performed when the moon turns green.<br /><br />The second problematic section was the one on exercise.  Human studies were done mainly on elderly humans, and \\"activity\\" was lumped together with vigorous exercise, the two being very different and having different effects on the body.  Second is that human associative behavior is not taken into account.  People who exercise, on the whole, tend to eat less \\"junk,\\" all of which contains high amounts of carbohydrates.  So what is causing the health improvement?  But the most outrageous comment (in one of the outline boxes frequently used in the book) is that lack of movement results in inflammation.  How does a supposedly responsible doctor make as statement like that?  The thinking is that the study showed that exercise reduces inflammation, therefore it is concluded that lack of exercise increases inflammation.  Do I have to go over the layers of problems with that logic?  I'd love to see Dr. Perlmutter produce the biological pathways or processes that support that assertion.<br /><br />It is automatically assumed that if activity is good, vigorous activity is better.  This does not necessarily follow.  Doesn't Dr. Perlmutter state that stress is a contributor to health issues?  How does the body know that the stress of exercise is good, but other stresses are bad?  The body is in tune with 2-million-year-old programming, not Michele Obama.  In prehistoric times, with food at a premium, there would be no logical reason to exert more energy than necessary.  This idea of enlarging the brain by running does not follow.  Our brain is large because we  use it to outsmart prey, not to outrun it--that's just plain silly.  (And I'm not talking about short sprints in conjunction with tracking and hunting).  It's another example of someone's biases (he's a runner) causing someone to make silly statements in order to fit a preconceived paradigm.<br /><br />The only logical reason to run would be to escape from something trying to kill (and probably eat) you.  The endorphins that exercisers perceive as a reward for their efforts are misunderstood.  These are rather consolation prizes for meeting an untimely and otherwise miserable death.  And the mouse studies are not relevant because again, from an evolutionary standpoint, mice were meant to run for different reasons than humans.  For a mouse, it's survival, so it makes sense that it would increase its brain size.  For a human it meant he was not all that adept in survival and not long for this earth.<br /><br />Furthermore, Dr. Perlmutter presents a patient who contradicts his exercise conclusion.  The man's health had been steadily deteriorating despite working out every day.  It wasn't until he changed his diet, that his health dramatically improved.  So where were those exercise benefits?<br /><br />You want to test the health effects of exercise?  First you need to separate out \\"activity\\" that does not raise the heart rate from \\"vigorous exercise\\" that does.  So there should be at least three groups including the non-movers.  Control for diet--again carb free with same food prepared similarly.  Then conduct your study.  I'd lay bets that the group that moves without raising the heart rate comes out on top, followed closely by non-movers, and in last place, the vigorous exercisers.

B00A7R0JPM|5.0|This book is amazing and I loved it. I loved how it was written, the story/s, and how it's enriched my inner world. It's rare for me to rave about a book this much but I will cherish the feelings, thoughts, insights, musings and tears this book gifted me for years to come.

B00BAYLQI0|5.0|Loved the product came in record time!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Haven't finished it yet, but Palacio has captured the heartbreak of children and adults who must live with this devastating condition. I highly recommend this book to readers of all ages. It is a wonder, just as Auggie is.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|I received the product in record time, the video was in excellent shape.  I would recommend it to a friend.  Thank You.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|I found the series to be intricate, exciting, suspenseful and psychologically challenging. It makes you think about what you have just watched and it's possible applications to modern America..

B00F5F0208|4.0|To be succinct, Take Care &#62; So Far Gone &#62; Thank Me Later &#62; Nothing Was The Same.<br /><br />This album is good, but the production is the least exquisite of all the above listed releases. That, and it comes off as random and unfocused at times. While he's done a great job up to this point giving us solid songs, this one misses the mark in that way. Some production doesn't really accompany sung vocal, but he sings on it anyway. The reverse/modulated/filtered synth effect that Drake has used before (and so many have modified since) seems a failed attempt to sound abstract or deep. Coupled with lyrics that sound like text message conversations from an overly emotional relationship rejectee, the feigned &#34;moodiness&#34; that he was going for was simply a miss. All in all though, there are some solid songs on here. About half are top quality, quintessential Drake cuts that shouldn't be missed. The rest are tolerable if you don't mind a swirl of pity parties and meaningless stammering.

B009LE7AU4|5.0|Thank you for writing this personal memoir, JT. I've been a Duran fan as long as I can remember, and this was a fascinating backstage pass into a world many fans were blissfully ignorant of at the time. The digital version offers beautiful pictures, audio, and videos.
B00BS7HNTK|5.0|Great music with multiple roots. These tunes are very catchy, and the album boasts more than one track that you will want to repeat.
B00BMR4RIG|1.0|When buy an apk it is ad free. Even though you give away a free paid apk everyday the ads are still attached. That's no deal.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I saw this in theaters with my friend when it came out and we loved it! We both bought physical copies of it to watch whenever we want.
0316228532|5.0|Great read. I had low expectations after reading mixed reviews but it's been very enjoyable. Great book for those of us who love looking beyond the exterior and seeing the inner workings of people's lives. Felt rather like a 21st century pop version of George Eliot.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My kids watch the polar express over and over. Constantly is like cable t v doesn't exist. They love it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It works great. I thought with it only being 720 it wouldn't look as good on the 65&#34; but it really looks great and I have told everyone I know how great it is and they should pick one up for themselves. I hate google chrome but thankfully this does not require me to have it and I just use my phone.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This app is great for all ages. Works beautifully on my kindle fire. I only have one complaint... my 4yr old son accidentally deleted the app. Although it was stored in my Amazon cloud, when I reloaded it to my device, all the purchased I made were gone. It kept my high score but not the characters and special boards I worked so hard to get. Very disappointing. I really enjoy playing the game and so do my kids. Just wish they could back up purchases so we don't lose them on accidental deletion. If not for this... I would give 5 stars.

B009H1S56O|5.0|I knew about the missing tracks problem with the \\"Paradise Edition Box Set\\", but I decided to take a chance and order this anyway.  I ordered directly from Amazon and the set turned out to be complete!  The 3 bonus tracks are present(the \\"Lolita\\" track is really catchy!).  Amazon must be stocking the fixed edition, so any Lana Del Rey fans should go ahead and order this box set without worries.
B002O3Z506|5.0|I grew up watching George Reeves as Superman.  He was the only Character that I can think of other than the TV Series Star Trek that I enjoyed.  So when Christopher Reeve Dawned the Role as Superman I was Amazed of the Story Telling of the Life of Superman.  Christopher Reeve became Superman for me.  I have seen other movies and the TV series made about Superman but they will never replace Christopher Reeve.  The Way they Revealed the Planet Krypton was a Wonder to See.  I have seen the Rendition of Krypton in the Movie Man of Steal, there is no comparison.  Also the Music that was Selected for the Movie was exciting.<br />It probably would be considered a Time Piece Movie now but it is Magic from a Child's Point of View.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|I think Persuasion is the most underrated Austrn novel, but to me the idea of two people realizing they are still in love after so many years is actually more romantic than the Pride and Prejudice story, much as I love Darcy. I much prefer this version to the more recent BBC version.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|Barbara Streisand is such a loving mother!  A little overbearing at times, but she means well.  If only her son appreciated her!  lol  Oh well, maybe he will show her how much he cares???!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is very well written.  I laughed, cried and really felt like I learned a lot.  It is an excellent book.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Whenever you're out at the pizza, sub shop, etc. and you are waiting in line for your turn or your food this app gives you a distraction away from the boring wait from what might seem to take forever to get through.  Its simple use your finger as the control is easy to use and my wife who usually doesn't like any app found it entertaining during a recent protracted wait we had.
B00FDSUJ0A|5.0|After two not so stunning albums they dinally get back to their roots. Wonder mix of songs that flow very well when you play the album through. Was waiting for this to come out ever since I heard &#34;this is gospel&#34; and they did not disappoint.
B009X00E18|3.0|We find it somewhat effective. If I had it to do over again, I would have purchased another product. It's just OK, not good
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I was really impress with the suspense and the acting in this series. What a setting. It just shows even small towns have their problems.
B008JFUO72|4.0|Iron man guy (Tony?) has a flashback of meeting two people he kinda uses and abuses. Of course the flashback is not just to fill up a movie. They return to the plot to cause pain and damage.<br /><br />I guess maybe I have seen too many of these movies to know if my \\"eh\\" feeling about this one is just boredom setting in or if this movie really was boring. I mean it was good and all of that but it just didn't seem to have a kick to it. It also seemed to comment in a sly ways on this or that in society as these types of movies do but they really didn't focus too much on them to really say much. I mean was the entire osama bin laden just to poke fun at him/mock him? or was there something else there? I mean if that had been in a movie circa 2004 then yeah it would have gone over well. But now? Just kinda goofy. And the idea that a person would go so far to regrow a limb that they would kill many people . . . is that social commentary on the science community using killed children (ie abortion) to regrow limbs or is that just showing human weakness and self-centeredness? I dunno. It was kinda mentioned in passing.<br /><br />Anyway it is slow at first but all the blowing up and killing and smartelecky lines will follow soon enough.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|I really love that i can watch movies for free with my amazon prime membership.  Its a great perk imo.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Pretty predictable and too many cliches, but moves quickly and has great effects...not going to pull you in like Walking Dead due to the limited time for character development...the almost super-natural survival ability of main character requires too much suspension of disbelief...and that's with the understanding that this is a fantasy, apocalyptic, zombie movie!
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|The twist at the end was really good and I didn't see it coming. I thought that a child of the before mentioned dead magician would be the mystery person behind everything but it was not who I thought it would be.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I first came across Evermore while browsing for a MS Word substitute so that I could take note for school, but it has since then become a go-to program for lists, journaling, and the like. I recommend Evernote chiefly for its design, versatility, and portability.
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|Should have kept actual prehistoric animals in it instead of making up fairytale like ones. Made the movie<br />seem silly at times but it was still rather enjoyable.
B00BYM5I1O|5.0|Perfect.  I fell on love with the title song more than a year ago and couldn't wait for it to be released. The album is full of more songs to love. Thank you Guy.
0425266060|4.0|Just the right amount of sex and romance.  Did not realize at first it was going to be &#34;continued.&#34;  Cannot wait for the next set!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a very fun game. It makes you use reasoning skills along with common sense to escape. Lots of mind racking entertainment. I highly recommend it!!!
B0083Z614S|5.0|I haven't seen the movie in years but reading the book is like being in the movie! A definite must read!
B0053O89WY|5.0|This show will become a comedy classic. a lot of the humor is just for nerds and that fits me perfect I hope it never ends.
1600242197|5.0|Great book for any American. This story will open the eyes of the reader of battle and sacrifice these men make everyday they are deployed.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Excellent book. Especially the ending! Makes you think about the choices you have made and might encourage you to think twice when faced with small or big decisions. What if?
B00BXLU1EU|1.0|Waste of time and space never try this is stupid I hate it very much it does not work u will be mad with this
0142501123|3.0|This book has great pictures and is so cute.  Love the story and the rhyming verse, HOWEVER, there were white/gray smudges and fingerprints on the front of all three books.  They did wipe off with a damp cloth but - Ewwwww! and Ick!  Whoever packed the books had grubby hands and it really creeped me out.
B00D2JDNQ4|2.0|A very ambitious work - admirable in that sense.  I found it hard to follow on the Kindle, characters get mixed up in the beginning, and once you get them straight, the end is very disappointing.  It should have ended very near the trial, the rest is superfluous and damages the impact of the novel.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|We've all got a new hero. Harold. It was wonderful to join him on his journey.  A great book club selection.
B000FC12L4|5.0|After a very long time reading sci-fi and fantasy, it isn't often I come across something new and different; This trilogy isn't like anything else I've read. Good characters, strong writing, really strange plot, and except for a few slow spots, all three books suck you onto her universe.
B007SGM084|5.0|These 3 books were amazing! Once I started to read, I could not put it down! These books are full of emotion and have a wonderful story line!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is one if the best books of a lifetime. My husband & I have the Kindle version & the hardback copy. The hardback has seen more hands than are written about in the book! Everyone loves it! A very touching account with so many wonderful people depicted! It gives such a personal touch to the war and those serving on BOTH sides! This book is a MUST even if you don't think you like nonfiction!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I've waited for this game and it exceeded my expectations. I would recommend everyone get this. I couldn't believe that not only is it free , but there are no adds. I've played it for the better part of two days and it seems to just get better. I have never written a review, but I felt this game above all others deserved a fitting 5 star testimonial.
B007XIC1GI|3.0|It was good. A strange man that Manson. A few cringeworthy moments. The stuff about his Grandfather was strange. Not a must read, but pretty interesting.
B005BX3NAA|5.0|Just the most amazing group of all time, even to this day, after almost 30 years, these songs make me move.... they cause me to reflect on that young boy I once was, and wish I had known then, what I know now. This is a bad ass collection of the best.
B009RX7WTI|5.0|I love Grey's Anatomy it is my favorite show and seeing how I have seasons 1-8 on dvd there was no way I was not going to order. I received it in great condition
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|The show is well written and acted. I've watched all os Seasons One and Two, and am watching Season Three. I would like to see at least one black male in a regular role. Recommended.
B007PVHMCG|1.0|I don't recommend buying it , because I odder a new set of minecraft Legos not a returned or a used set I'm upset because I clearly odder a new one and receive a crappy box with open bags, and top all that with missing Legos I expect the seller to solve this soon .
B004JN1D2I|5.0|For whatever reason I didn't get  into the T.V. show but the book is great. Reading this book is like going into another world full of complex characters and schemes. My son kept telling me to  read this and finally I got the  4 book bundle before going on a vacation and I haven't put it down since. This writer has a new fan!
B000001DTM|5.0|This album is a great work by great artists and it follows a series of excellent albums (War, The Unforgettable Fire, & The Joshua Tree) by the band.<br /><br />This album was the foundation for U2's excellent Zoo TV tour.  It's songs are interesting, and run from modern electric songs to rich harmonies.
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|a good, informative movie that covers as much of the inside story as is possible in an hour and a half. anyone with an interest in muscle shoals should do themselves a favor immediately and watch.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Good movie as well as story. Loved it I didn't get bored I will watch it again and will wait for n 2
B00B89LZ4C|5.0|Love it, so life like and the detail is amazing . Would recommend this to any hardcore Breaking Bad fan.
B00004WGC4|5.0|Fawlty Towers is British comedy at its best.  I enjoy watching it over and over and sharing it with friends who stop by.  Telling about it is good but being able to let them see is so much better.
B00296A4F4|5.0|What's not to like? I missed the first season and was catching up. Adorable show, nice to see where the characters started.
B008Y7J91M|5.0|Engaging, endearing, and sweet entertainment. I've watched it twice and will do so again.<br />One of the best BBC productions I've enjoyed.
B00742GBDM|4.0|Fanny is a beautiful role-model of patience, humility and not letting anyone take away who you are.  This is a beautiful story of the truest love - the kind that waits for what is real.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Lots of fun, addictive. Can't put it down. I really like the different places and the holiday themes are fun. I would like to be able to go back to previous countries fans pick up the characters I missed at..first.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This was an over all good book. I didn't read this series to begin with because I am not into Soft porn, but at the request of a couple of friends I finely gave in. Yes this book does have sex scenes, but no they aren't that graphic. I mean the author never once refers to her body or his other than full, my sex etc. The story behind the sex is the interesting part. And to be honest I almost didn't get the next book in line because I was so mad at how this one ended. However I did get the others and they were good. Are they the best book I've ever read no, but its a good book that held my attention after the story started to flow. And I found myself pulling for both of their happiness. In the end if your on the fence about this series as I was. Just go ahead and read it. I enjoyed it. Still trying to figure out how they are going to make a movie, but thats for Hollywood to figure out. Not me. Thanks for reading and I hope that this helps a few of you.
B000002MZ9|5.0|I was working in a Borders music department when this came out and it became an instant favorite. It just rips right along and some of the songs, \\"Downtown\\" and \\"I'm the Ocean\\" for Pete's sake are just some of the best songs ever. Crazier than Crazy Horse, NY at full roar full bore.  This is good one to keep in your car, just in case.  I put this up with Everybody Knows This is Nowhere - it is really do whacka do.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Nice story - well told - an easy read...for me wasn't the tear-jerker everyone raved about - but very enjoyable read.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I have downloaded and re-installed this app 4 times, cleared the cache each time, and still can NOT open my email. The ads work, but I don't want them. Why do these providers think their app/programs have to be so pretty in order to open and READ an email? If you haven't checked it out on all the Types you service, DON'T release it. And each time it gives me a different background, which is probably covering the message. This is the worst effort yet from Yahoo.
B004JN1D2I|2.0|I was very disappointed as I read what could have been a great story except for all the graphic sex. I will not buy another of George R. R. Martin's books.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Easy to learn how to use, although I had some trouble initially when looking for certain characters. Didn't take long to find them, though.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|Book was okay, it should be advertised as more for  a younger (16-22) audience - or maybe it is and I didn't notice. Good character development.
B00DJZR46G|3.0|No question, Elton John and Bernie Taupin had a good idea when they eschewed the overelaborate production and went back to basics for this recording that consists largely of Elton's piano, the bass, drums, and guitar.  That's a refreshingly retro approach if only the bulk of the songs measured up, which sadly they don't.  There are exceptions like the elegaic, stately ballad \\"Home Again\\" as well as the somewhat jaunty, wistful, \\"Can't Stay Alone Tonight.\\"  What's left however are many songs in the same slow, to mid tempo with very little variation.<br /><br />Granted, there are some other good songs on the album, but at 16 songs or so, (including musical interludes), this could have been a more varied journey and though he hasn't done it all too convincingly of late, Elton used to be able to knock out an awesome rocker (Saturday's Alright For Fighting, The Bitch is Back, Levon, and I'll even go with I'm Still Standing, and the lesser known Kiss the Bride from the 1980's, and Runaway Train with Clapton in the 1990's) which fans of that side of his music have known to give up on at this point.  It's not like an aging artist can't rock convincingly as The Stones, and even recently to a lesser degree Rod Stewart (on a few tracks on his new album) have proven can be done at their age, and Bruce Springsteen has never stopped doing.  Again, since the effective rocker was part of Elton's musical arsenal in his heyday, one would have hoped he would have capably covered that ground on this effort.<br /><br />So, in summation, this is a solid, but somewhat repetitive effort from one of the great artists of the past several decades.  Let's hope the next time Elton records he remembers the fans of his rock oriented material.  In the meantime, if you buy this CD, enjoy the simple pleasures that you can get from his always reliable ballads.  Just be ready to say, haven't I heard this song already on this album?
1936608898|5.0|Good review of nutrition and how processed foods are affecting our health.  Just so happens a chronic rash has disappeared and joint pain is much less.  I encourage anyone to try this diet alteration.
B00DWV3NM6|5.0|Massive and plenty of room left to overclock, laughs at everything I've thrown at it. You get what you pay for.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|Steinbeck describes the simplicity, honesty, wisdom, pain, and courage of these characters with such powerful language and imagery.  I felt as though I were traveling with them, taking part in all that was their lives.  The book stays with me still.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I have not been this attached to characters in a book since i read Fried Green Tomatos. I could hardly put it down. The imagery was so clear. The story so compelling and it felt real and true to the historical perspective. Reminded me of another book i loved called Cane River.
B003VANOFY|5.0|great headset i love the way it feels and all of the functions it can use!<br />works with all of the games i play online and really glad i bought it
B005MHI0QM|5.0|Prior to reading this book I knew Anne Frank had perished long ago but for a short time she was alive sitting in my home full of promise desire and expectations.  I dreaded reaching the end but here I sit wishing to reach into the past and shield her.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I TOUGHT THIS GAME IS VERY FUN AND CHALLEDGING. MY SISTER ALSO LIKES THIS GAME. I REALLY LIKE COLLECTING THE PEOPLE. THATS WHAT I THINK OF THIS FUN GAME.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|The bingo blitz GAME is a lot of fun. Many different games and levels. I enjoy the tournament rooms. The only issue that I have had is getting locked up during a game. Try it and you will get hooked.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|I thought Rebus was lost forever.  Ian Rankin at his Rebus best.  I read it in one night, really good story.
0385743564|4.0|Just as the title says. Without spoilers, I'll say that it was an exciting and fun read on a great premise. However, it falls a little flat in many of the character developments. And contrary to Sandersons best works, there isn't a well defined system for the magic. Even in the book itta mentioned that the rules of physics aren't followed. I wouldn't normally have a problem with this, as anyone who's read his other works knows this isnt the case anyways. Despite that, it's usually a well defined and deeply appealing from the get go. Here it just feels like an excuse to not define the rules in an attempt to churn out another book and fix it later, like a game developer often does in order to make the release date. All that being said, I couldn't seem to put the book down, and that is one of the marks of a great read. I had a number of theories as to Steelheart's weakness myself, and these were voiced accurately in the book. Sandersons anticipation of his readers thoughts is always stunning to see, and while the ending wasn't what I had hoped, it was still pretty good. All in all, well worth 12 bucks.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|Great movie and music. Hugh Grant is a great fit to lead this escape from what government really looks like! LOL
B009LH1Y1W|3.0|Dean had the chance to close the gates of Hell forever by sacrificing Sam. He didn't. That was incredibly selfish of him. If such a thing exists, I'd sacrifice me, my family, my friends, my town, my state, maybe even my country. To close the gates of Hell forever? Sheyit.
B00CLZ4B4I|5.0|We bought this movie because my niece was staying with us over the weekend.  All the kids loved the movie and I felt it was ok for children to watch.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a very fun game it up because my time I even let my kids play sometime so I think you should be its really nice to have this single is the best bingo app I have for you so far
B00DURHYWC|5.0|We went to pink martini's concert by accident. It turned out that Pink Martini is the greatest band and this album is one of the best in their collections.
1781162646|4.0|...and are complaining that this wasn't a scary story, surprise!  It's not a ghost story.  It was published under the &#34;Hard Case Crime&#34; imprint, and that's exactly what this was.  A story about a murder, which happened to include a ghost as not much more than a peripheral character.<br /><br />That said, it was an entertaining read.  Coming of age, first loves, etc., as many other reviewers have said in more detail than I need to go into. I find myself enjoying's SK's &#34;non-genre&#34; works more than his stories that would typically fall into the horror genre.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|It was free and works well for burning time while waiting at the doctors office,etc. I learned to play this game in high school and still find it fun.
B001APXLOG|5.0|This book is dated but ice cream making hasn't changed much. It contains a plethora of simple ice cream and sorbet recipes. There's even a couple of baking and sauce recipes. Many people will take issue with the fact that the base recipe does not direct you to cook your egg mixture, however, I simply heat my eggs, milk, and sugar until almost boiling. Then I add the heavy cream, etc, and cool the mixture. Simple. You will find every flavor you could want and some you might not want. I've tried half a dozen recipes and have loved each one. This is a great reference book. Enjoy!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I always like free stuff. Playing simple games keeps the mind healthy and active. It can also be a stress reliever. I have a bunch of free games on my kindle and can escape from the real world when needed.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved the book. The characters were compeelling. The story was riveting. I coupldn't put the book down. I have since read 2 of her earlier novels, which were equally enjoyable
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like to keep my mind stimulated, and games can help accomplish that. Solitaire is a game I have always enjoyed and play it frequently. I have it on my kindle with several other games and use them to escape reality on occasion.
B0063GORYU|2.0|I downloaded this app because I like the game.  The game is the game, what can I say.  What I don't like is the fact that every time I launch the game a commercial pops up and I have to get out of it before I can play the game.  I am going to delete this app today!!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|it's ok I do wish it had levels. the car is awesome. and it's all coins witch makes it kind of BORING.
B00FEHXISA|5.0|I thought it was better than 2 and just as good if not better than 1.  Really worth a watch!
B00156ZWV0|5.0|Incredible collection of just about everything on CD from the Master!<br />Surprisingly excellent sound and an Amazing bargain for the price!<br />Loving every CD.
B00ESY77LO|5.0|Leanardo Dicaprio and Toby McGuire are super in this movie, real good chemistry between the two.  I like this version better than the first movie with Redford.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My grandson loves this game.  He is 5 years old and suggested I download it because he played it on another device!  He needs a little help with reading at times but plays the game better than I could.
0307476073|4.0|The author was obvious quite organized--but somehow she managed to neglect trying out her boots and her pack under hiking conditions before she hiked the Pacific Crest Trail.
B0094K1PW4|5.0|Great litte thriller, didnt expect that much action. Kept me glue to my seat. Still picture quality issues dont know if it my sony blueray player or what. I panicked when my stream stopped, but turned off player and it resumed were it left off. Wounder if streaming thru roku or a tivo would be clearer?
B0081336FO|5.0|I love this show. Great take on a classic. So glad it's available on prime. :) looking forward to finishing this season.
B000066NW0|3.0|This album of avril lavigne debut was ok. There's really only 3 good songs on it. The first 3 in order: &#34;losing grip&#34; , &#34;complicated&#34; and &#34;.sk8er boi&#34;. The rest of this album just goes down hill but it is worth buying for everyone who loves those first three songs two of which are hits!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Loved this book, could not put it down. Couldn't wait to read the second in the series and find out what happened to the characters.
B0092G1O8A|5.0|I already saw this movie and I loved it so I had to buy the dvd! Jennifer Lawrence is awesome as the lead role katniss. The way she shoots her bow and arrow is always to perfection! I can't wait to see her kick some even more serious butt in catching fire and in mockingjay 1 and 2!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Love this game. I agree with that a button to push to request neighbors would be nice. Gems need to be easier to get, but still a great game to play.
B0090SI4LU|5.0|Saoirse ronan is fantastic in this movie. She is the perfect hostess to host this movie for everyone who wants to watch it for either the first time or even on loop!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The Acting, the Script, the Costumes/Clothes are all amazing!  So deep and sophisticated ... better than anything on American TV.  A perspective on a period of time and class that is an awe inspiring learning experience
B009SJ3GUK|2.0|It did not live up to season one. This season was just all over the place. Hopefully season three is better.
B001H4R4LQ|4.0|each book leads you to the next so well. I didn't want to stop reading because I didn't want to miss what was coming next!
0345534379|3.0|I should have read the details better...was expecting a hard covered one with colorful pictures for my young son.  Needless to say I kept this one, and just spent another $20 on a hardcover.
B005XUC398|3.0|Extremely slow pace with virtually nothing happening after the first 5 minutes. With such a great cast really expected more from it, but I guess script deficiencies are too big to overcome. It was not too big to fail. :)
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The book had me asking for more at the end of each chapter. Full of characters to love and hate. I can not wait to continue the series.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|This book was really well written and love the characters.  Had some humor , sadness and what a family does.  Hard to put down.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|A great read for artists, actors, musicians, and writers. Also, anyone who has problems with procrastination, or getting started and maintaining a healthy diet or exercise plan. Anyone who has a dream that they just can't seem to get going, can benefit from this book.
1569765677|5.0|I saw the movie \\"Hurricane\\" with Denzel Washington and was so moved by the film that I immediately went to my computer and purchased the book from Amazon. What I did not realize is that the book was far more powerful than the film! It offers the complete insights of what the correctional facilities are like in a dog-eat-dog nightmare that Rubin Carter endured for most of his adult life.<br />The courage and ferocity of this man is unrivaled and I could not put the book down. Carter is a testimony to what \\"the system\\" can do to a man and yet he overcame insurmountable odds in the face of bigotry and hatred. He is a legend, an unsung hero and a man that faces life and its challenges with a tenacity few in society could endure. This book will change your perceptions in many, many ways. I strongly advocate it!
074322454X|5.0|an epic journey and a historically fantastic and very well told by all participants and very well written by the author
B000AP04MO|5.0|I saw this on AMC one night and it held my attention. At first (I saw the middle to the end) I was like &#34;This is really weird&#34; but then it captivated me. The acting was wonderful. The storyline hits home a bit and just a great classic. There was a lot of hidden notes about marriage in here and I have to give it that respect. If you love Audrey Hepburn, love her for this as well, not just Breakfast at Tiffany's.
1118109791|5.0|This book is my main study book. It's really helps to get all the strategy I need in GMAT exam.  Good tests inside.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|I never felt interested to watch this show on my own, until my husband told me a little about it. I watched this first episode and I was like &#34;Wow! Now that's good acting!&#34; the whole series just kept my attention. The characters were very well animated and I loved how there was a lot of drama, but quite a bit of side humor as well!
B00BD6RFFS|5.0|Great for people who look for a guideline to map your business or future business you are willing to start a new business.
0345529057|5.0|Buy and read these or go to ur local library but they are likely checked out. Cause this is quite the hotness
B005C0DHEY|5.0|A revealing documentary on environmental hazards and water well contamination related to hydrofracking of natural gas wells.  Very well done!.
B0015AARJI|5.0|It was a gift for a friends son and he has played it non stop really loves it. Thank you
B00ARF93AQ|2.0|I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I does not have a good story line and there is why too much random violence.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Was looking forward to this season after the climax of season seven and this didn't disappoint!! Supernatural back to it's best.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I got this app for free and it has been really fun and addictive!! Get this game for endless hours of enjoyment
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|Have collected the Tom Selleck movies, have the whole series of his movies.  Love his character, hope they will come out with more.
0545626382|5.0|great books, came fast, and undamaged
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|Love Sandra Bullock's movies, great actress and good movie.  Love the little boy in the movie always look forward to her movies.
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|The movie will never be as good as the book. Deal with it. It can never be as descriptive or as imagined. Nothing will ever compare to your own imagination. Come on people.....<br />Either way.. I am seriously picky about what movies I watch, and I was very skeptical about this movie. It just didnt seem that great but I was bored and out of things to watch. (lol) BUT I loved it. It wasnt the most incredible movie I've ever seen, but it was lovely. The acting was better than most teenage movies out today, the plot was unique and interesting, and it kept me guessing. Just a lovely movie. I have now been persuaded to read the books :) Worth the rent.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|This book by Brandt Legg, as with all good stories, allows you to experience the events. By following through the eyes of young Nate, we unravel a mystery, discover why his brother is in an institution, and can see his kind of growth and maturing. Brandt has a keen sense of how his characters would truly interact. Why his he experiencing intense visions?  The application by Brandt Legg, including historical places, and what seem like actual events, are infused throughout, capturing and holding a readers attention. The universe has layers and folds, and so does this first book of a, soon to be, 'Inner Movement' trilogy. It's a curl up on the weekend book. From start to finish, it's imaginative and ends with you looking forward to Brandt's next book.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Very Good, Interesting one. Worth every penny. Bought after watching the movie though i feel it more interesting. Buy It
B00C8985DU|5.0|I bought this because i am a die hard Paul McCartney fan. i was delighted to see how much you got for the price. the pictures are so incredible. Linda's photos capture Paul and the Band and it bring such joy to be able to see just how talented she was as a photographer and a singer. I will continue to buy from Amazon.<br /><br />Rosemary
B004JN1D2I|5.0|As a Tolkein fan and lover of all things medieval, I was naturally drawn to this series. Martin has created a beautiful and in depth world with such complex characters that I quite literally could not put it down. I feel that to truly appreciate the series you should read it, then watch the HBO series, the reread the books. My first time through, I think I missed a lot of details in my haste to see what was going to happen next, so reading it a second time I knew the larger picture and was more patient in my reading the details. The foreshadowing was easier to pick up on also. You should watch the tv series to give faces to the characters and I believe you will enjoy seeing the differences between the series and the books.<br /><br />This is an absolute must read!
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|Great game. So far my best time is 11minutes 3seconds for the expert. Someone had said that if you left the game all your numbers that you put in the little squares were gone and you had to start over. If you put your game on hold then leave the game, the numbers will be there when you return.

B00EOO55GW|5.0|I'm a fan of all A7X albums, and this one doesn't disappoint. Like many other reviewers have already stated, it's an awesome flashback to older rock albums (Metallica, G&R, Iron Maiden, etc) but it keeps the A7X feel. The more I listen to it, the more I love it. The sound clips on Amazon don't do it justice...buy it and listen to it on a good system and you'll understand.
B0094MAZKK|5.0|I love this movie. When i looked it up on other sites nobody knew what i was talking about but i came to amazon and it was here. I love it because it has so much action from beginning to end. I couldn't wait to get it in the mail i had to see it know once i found it lol ;-)  amazon thank you.
B004HMQ7BI|3.0|It was a fairly light entertaining film. I rented it for some views of Tuscany, but was disappointed about that.
B001NEXEEG|5.0|Very much more than a good western Movie. Brings into question between two diametrically opposed codes of conduct: the wild West, rule with a gun and unquestioned loyalty versus the &#34;rule of law&#34; and what is right.<br />Great philosophical material!
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|Working flawlessly. The little light under the logo is a nice touch. The rubber feet work really well and have keep it in place on my desk even when I've accidently tugged on it with a peripheral's cable. It's these little details that I like.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|A must have for any Big Bang Theory fan. One of the best and funniest season`s yet , What`s not to love with this cast ?!!!
B008CPZNL6|5.0|This app has an impressive design. The manner in which the pages flip is elegant and smooth. The news content loads instantly and updates regularly.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved it; I can't wait for Season 4 on Prime. I would rate more shows or movies if Amazon didn't require a written comment!
B009LDD1X0|5.0|I wouldn't be watching this if I didn't enjoy the first five seasons.  Once again, everyday social interactions are both awkward and hilarious and the entire group is delightful to watch as they muddle through.  Well done.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it! This app is great! (cause on Pc it is $21 and on pe $6). I really reccomend this.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The movie is very good. However, I got frustrated since the movie was frozen many times! WIsh Amazon could resolve this problem.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|This show is phenomenal or I wouldn't have purchased the second season. Fantastic series all together with a great cast and exciting episodes.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever you can let you're imagination run wield you can create what ever you want.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I love this series, I love owning it too! The process was simple and it was easy to watch instantly.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This  game  is incredibly fun! It is well worth $1.99. FlipPix has kept me and my sister occupied during long car rides with just our kindles. I have no complaints about this game.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|Love this movie, a story of lost love and the will to get it back. At times a little sad but hopeful that it will work out all right at the end. From the books of Nicholas Sparks who wrote: The Notebook, Dear John, Safe Haven, Message in a bottle, Nights at Rodante ,The Lucky One.
B007G5K066|3.0|SLOW.  Great story but moves slowly and does not hold my interest. For such a important real event in history the movie does not have impact.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I can't tell you how much I love this movie, these actors sing beautifully even though they are not professional singers. At times very sad but then your spirits are uplifted and you just want to join in and sing with them, as I sometimes do.
1451695195|5.0|I bought this book awhile back to give a friend as a gift, then a week later hearing about what a great book it was, I ended up ordering another one for myself.  So far I'm impressed on what I have read and think others will like this book too.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|Seen their show live and love this dvd. They all sing so beautifully and the music is so uplifting. Their costumes are as beautiful as they are. See this dvd and then go see them live!!!
B0090SI582|2.0|\\"You are strong. You have courage, real courage but that won't help you much now.\\" Logan (Jackman) is called to Japan by an old friend. What he finds is something he never could have imagined. For the first time in his live Logan is vulnerable and is pushed to his limits to not only save himself but to save those around him and even The Wolverine is no match for what he has to face. First of all I will say that I liked the first X-men and loved First Class but wasn't a fan of the others so I wasn't really looking forward to this one all that much. I am also not a comic book fan. I say that for two reasons. First I know the movie is based off a comic story line so fans of that will love this movie. For the casual X-Men fan like me this is nothing like an X-Men movie at all. Again even though this is based off an actual comic plot the movie felt like; \\"Let's make a samurai movie.\\" \\"No one in America would watch one though\\" \\"Put Wolverine in it and they will.\\" Without trying to give anything away they could have done this movie with out the Wolverine character and it would have not changed anything. There is even a scene where he uses a Samauri sword to fight with instead of his claws...really. The best part of the movie is the little scene during the credits so be sure to watch that. Overall, this does not have the feel of an X-Men movie at all so if that's what you are looking for be warned. Comic book readers will love this though. I didn't. I give it a C.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Loved it as much as the movie, I sometimes walk about singing some of the music especially Do You Hear The People Sing which is actually missing from the soundtrack. It's sought of there in the finale but different.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|SwiftKey is blessing in disguise.  As a developer I know when u create a product that is awesome and is loved by everyone  we as devs feel great.  SwiftKey team you have done an awesome job
B006IGZWB2|4.0|Wonderful cast! Love Emma Stone! She portrays a great tole in this movie and shows why her future is secure in Hollywood and beyond.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved this book! Started reading it and I couldn't put it down! A real page turner! Would highly recommend it!
B00EO10M54|5.0|Really impressed with this album. I never really listened to any of Mileys music until &#34; We Can't Stop&#34; but I'm totally digging her!! Like for realz.. :) Defiantly give Bangerz a shot. It will not disappoint.:):)
B001NLL93W|5.0|My daughter and I both read the series and love them all.  E-Books are my new favorite way to read now,  I wish I had a Kindle instead of having to read it from the app on my phone.  It would be even better reading from a KIndle.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|My daughter and I both read the series and love them all.  E-Books are my new favorite way to read now,  I wish I had a Kindle instead of having to read it from the app on my phone.  It would be even better reading from a KIndle.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|My daughter and I both read the series and love them all.  E-Books are my new favorite way to read now,  I wish I had a Kindle instead of having to read it from the app on my phone.  It would be even better reading from a KIndle.
B009WUBERW|4.0|Great sequel to the first movie, love all the actors involved and the plot of the movie great watch !!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I was looking for a repeat with new people but this is a good movie and I enjoyed it very much
B009ZQJ0ME|5.0|A great story pointing out the pros/cons of a voluntary self subjugation for peace of mind.<br />Ignorance is bliss idea. Also, the martial arts gun ninja is a very rare storyline perception and perspective. I found it to be very entertaining and thought provoking.
0689835604|3.0|What can I say... A cute concept but my one year old just isn't as wowed as she is with other flap lifting books.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|I couldn't wait for more after reading Eleanor and Park, and was not disappointed. It was as if I was back in college and swept up all over again in the feelings of fear of my own independence and struggling to grow up... When's the next book out?
B00E0SX118|5.0|Very cute family movie or if your just a big kid at heart like me I really enjoyed it. There were some parts that had me tearin up though
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Absolute perfection in puzzle/maze games.  Loved the first two Quells and Momento is just as amazing. It doesn't get any better than this!
0061730335|5.0|WOW!!! An inspiring story about an inspiring young man. William Kamkwamba made it through famine, poverty, and lack of education to create a windmill that brings electricity and water to his village in Malawi.<br /><br />Kamkwamba says, \\"I went to sleep dreaming of Malawi, and all the things made possible when your dreams are powered by your heart... We must encourage those still struggling to keep moving forward. My fellow students and I talk about creating a new kind of Africa, a place of leaders instead of victims, a home of innovation rather than charity... By working together, we can help remove this burden of bad luck from their backs, just as I did, and use it to build a better future.\\"<br /><br />Karen Molenaar Terrell
B00821OX98|3.0|I tried to start watching this series, but its not much attractive at the first glance it seems, so discontinued.
B0035LMTZA|5.0|It was probably the 5th time I watched this movie. I love it. The streaming quality was perfect and the sound quality was also enjoyable.
B007SGM084|5.0|Well written series,  keeps reader's attention and very sexy! Worth the purchase, so go ahead and get it all three books!
1449433251|4.0|I was extremely excited when this was finally in my hands. I grew up reading Calvin & Hobbes in grade school and it became more popular for me than Garfield and Peanuts. Going into junior high and high school they had moved to the back (close to the center though) of my mind. I would have given it a perfect rating if it weren't for one damaged corner of the box case containing the books (and the cardboard box was also damaged, no blame on you Amazon). But overall the books are fine and I am perfectly content with my order :)
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|it wont fn work it wont fn download fix it fn fix it make a good lokin game work please
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This is my personal favorite in the trilogy, and it has the most perfect ending to any set of movies ever. Blu-ray is worth it, tons of extra features.
B009UNGYHG|4.0|Finally have a way of carrying the plantronics in a pocket, or backpack when traveling. Having it charge the bluetooth is an extra benefit. Like this one a lot.
B00AFPTSI0|5.0|It was such a good read that I decided to GIVE by writing my first Amazon review after being a TAKER for so many years.  It is a very small step, but the first step is the HARDEST.  Knowing how difficult it is for me to take action, any book that compels me to do so is worth recommending to others:  I am going to GIVE copies of this book to friends and family.<br /><br />The Diamond Cutter is another great book that explains why we need to GIVE.  If you can only read two books this year, read these two!
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|This movie is very entertaining. It is filled with laughs for parents and children alike. I think it is especially poignant for a father.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|My daughter (and I) are great Gilmore fans. She LOVED this as a Christmas gift and has hosted several Gilmore sleepovers! It is wonderful to have all the seasons packed together in an easy carry case. Perfect for traveling or taking to another Gilmore sleepover.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|It has bad graphics and glitches sometimes, but overall I am impressed.<br />It shows that even handheld devices can have fun, CallOfDuty like games.<br />I would definetly reccomend it.<br /><br />It shows that even a tablet can have fun, CallOfDuty like games<br />I would definetly reccomend it<br />I
B00B81B0HC|5.0|Love this album. I was a big fan of radioactive but was unsure about how the rest of the album would be. Its great . There's at least 2 more songs that will be #1 hits and the rest is solid. Huge diversity of songs. Great purchase.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This is a nice version of Mahjong. There are several play options and a ton of board layouts. I recommend it.
B00FFVML74|5.0|[NO SPOILERS where it's telling the story]<br /><br />Broadchurch - such a good [short] series.  LOL  I know that British dramas can be notoriously short, but you know what, sometimes that's a good thing!  With just eight episodes to the Season, Broadchurch rope you in, gave you some prospective on what's it like to have major crime in a small town setting where everyone knows each other and how the ugliness of suspicion can reel it's head.<br /><br />The acting was good.  Di Hardy and DS Miller were two polar-opposites: one standing on the outside looking in, and the other already inside but walks around with prideful denial.  As if to say, \\"no one in my town would/could do such a heinous crime.\\"  To which kept them at odds with one another.<br /><br />The mystery, the shady characters... had me wanting to speculate who done it, however - I did not fool myself into trying to guess whom the culprit could've been.  I waited and episode 8 was explosive!!!!  I would've never thought that 'person' would have been the one.<br /><br />And that last episode was powerful enough that it (I'll admit) made me cry!  And I was on the train going home watching the episode!  Ha!<br /><br />If you haven't seen this series, I highly recommend.  It was just that good!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome. My daughter and son loves it! I personally think some of the items are overpriced. It takes a long time to collect a lot of gems.
B005M61PGA|4.0|Not as good as some of her past albums, but there were a few really great songs. I can't wait to hear more from this girl.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Anyone who wants to keep mentally sharp...add this book to your reading. I not only learned vital information for senior living but have a much clearer understanding of childrens mental issues affected by dietary choices. A must read for everyone.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this app is an amazing app. Pleese get this app!!!!!!!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!$<br />its epic your bad if you d ont like it
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love the game and play it all the time however my complaint would be the way it freezes!  my whole family plays on either kindell fire or their Ipads
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I love not knowing what's going on in a book, completely lost and completely engulfed at the same time. The story very very slowly enfolds and hooks you. Sci-fi at its best, and not at all contrived.
B009LDD22U|5.0|Always a great laugh love the show! The cast together are hilarious the show plot is an A+ this is a show to watch!
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|This one was off our usual beaten path.  The story was intriguing and the casting was excellent.  A bit bloody, but what isn't these days?  Very entertaining.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is fun but there are some glitches and bugs that are annoying like sometimes the game lags and you trip or fall.Just a bit fixing would make the<br />game great.:)
B003QTWR08|5.0|I was looking for a feel-good diversion one Friday night.  I'd hear this was good, so I watched.  Loved it!
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|Seriously!!  You people need to get a sense of humor ( and probably a life).  And really, you hate black and white?  Do you all work for Turner Colorization MegaCorp?  Great film; great adaptation.  Don't listen to these churlish miscreants.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my 3.5 year old daughter and my husband loves this game. They fight over who gets to play all the time.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|i love the old style they should do a lot more. you should get more people to do this now
0393035158|5.0|Sam Harris is a genius. This book is amazing and I recommend it to anybody who wants to become enlightened on the reality of religious stupidity.
B001NHNG64|5.0|On a bright sunny day in Chicago, a woman is going to bring in her clothes to a dry cleaner.  Since she is limping and is on crutches, Jack Reacher wants to help her.  What he doesn’t know is that this woman is being followed and before you know it, he, along with the woman, is kidnapped by four thugs.<br /><br />  Once inside the van, Reacher learns that the woman that is kidnapped is Holly Johnson, an FBI agent.  The kidnappers aren’t saying why they decided to kidnap this woman and Reacher isn’t getting any answers right away.  It seems that neither one is going to get out of this alive.<br /><br />  This is the beginning of Die Trying by Lee Child.  I can’t help but say from the start that this is the best book I’ve read by Child since I started reading the books in order.  I like the way Child builds the tension in the story as we slowly learn who the kidnappers are and what they are going to do.<br /><br />  There are a lot of layers that are peeled away in the story and each layer builds more suspense and adds to the plot.  There are a lot of surprises along the way as a result.  I thought it was creative that we see the kidnappers connection to a bigger group and what the group represented.  It does come right out of the headlines that you read in the newspapers and it was a great way to make a connection that built up the suspense even more.<br /><br />  Holly Johnson was not only an FBI agent but she was tough as well, even under the worst of circumstances.  Child built a great character here and you knew she was not helpless although having Reacher there as a protector even in dire circumstances made the book even better.<br /><br />  What can you say about Reacher.  He’s the one who still has to play the hero and of course, that means being a sniper and stopping this insane group of radicals who hate the government.  There is a lot that he has to deal with throughout the story and each part of the plot involves him solving one problem beforeanother one comes up right after that.<br /><br />  I had no problem with the point of view changing throughout the story as it switched to the FBI agents looking for Holly to the kidnappers and the group.  It was a great way to add tension to the story since you didn’t know what the ultimate role the FBI would play in the story as well.<br /><br />  Compared to One Shot and Running Blind, this is my favorite Lee Child novel and I would easily give it five stars.  I’l be anxious to see how the other ones are after reading this one.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game was stimulating and entertaining without being overly taxing. A very nice relaxing pastime after a long day of work.
B0091WAWTM|3.0|Conceptually this film is great, but nearly 40 years later it just doesn't cut the mustard if you are looking for true blue horror. If anything I think it should be reclassified into a new film genre called \\"creepy/uncomfortable\\". Maybe that is what the Brits were going for all along.<br /><br />If you are running through the gamut of \\"Horror\\" this Halloween season it would in your best interest to avoid this unless you do some non-spoiler research and come up with a good drinking game to pair it with. My girlfriend and I watched this early on during my favorite 31 days, so I don't feel like I've lost much ground. 20 more days of Horror left to go in 2013. Wish me luck.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|It works great as described, easy to use and sharpens my knives with ease, and works great with my all my pocket knives and kitchen knives.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Consumer is losing control of their page allowing more unwanted viewers of your page.  Need to give consumer more control.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Andrea Bocelli is the greatest.  I saw him in concert at Central Park in New York (September 2011).  I have every CD he has made.  Relaxing music, even when he sings in Italian!
B002361MLA|5.0|I recommend this book to those people that have an understanding of the spiritual realm. I needed to understand how to control my thoughts to understand my mind is a member if my body not my whole being. A must read and keep
1476727651|5.0|As always, a page turner to the end. Danny has lingered in the back of my mind. It is good to see him deal with his legacy of alcohol and domestic violence.
B00EU9VCKO|5.0|Great app no adds I can see.had great fun messing with my photos definatly recommend very easy to use .
B001UV4XHY|5.0|This is a great story and I enjoy watching the characters develop and manage the challenges placed in their way!
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|Ordered three so I could reflect each movie. To bad there is no hover board, or train to reflect the third movie.
B004EBT6HE|5.0|I've read most of Follett's work and he never fails to amaze me. This one is unique, no wars, just an amazing clever premise.
B00BMR4RIG|3.0|It will take some time to get a real opinion on it's + and - compared to other apps, so far it looks reasonable.
B000059MEL|5.0|I faced doubt and fears when ordering this product, but recognizing Daft Punk's validity in the music industry I had to take a chance and purchase it. Once received, I was surprised to find that it comes in an ornate cover that holds both records and contains a great graphic when unfolded. Sounds great, tunes are nice. S***s legit yo
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This is an amazing book full of  cliff hangers and suspense, one if the best books I've read in a while.
B00190OHD6|5.0|This movie really touches the heart! Most women would love to have this kind of man as a husband. One part that really got me was after an intense argument he comes back inside and sweetly asks, &#34;Are we finished now, love?&#34; Who wouldnt want to end a fight in such a tender way? Gerard Butler (Jerry) melts the heart as he continuously shows his love for his wife Holly, even after his death. One look and a smile from him would make any woman swoon. This has definitely become one of my most favorites of all times. Ive watched it like a gazillion times since I got it.
B00DL2W7Q4|3.0|I have read all of Gladwell's books and thought them all very thought provoking and interesting. David and Goliath is not as great as his previous ones but my problem is increasingly with his premise. He seems to believe that money and having lots of it is what constitutes \\"success\\" and \\"achievement\\". I.e. a successfull person is a rich person. I think that lots of people have achieved lots of admirable things without ever becoming rich or famous.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|This was a fun but pretty mindless ride.  Not as engaging as the first two &#34;Ironmen&#34;.  I'm not a real fan of Guy Pearce, anyway, and he didn't fail to disappoint as the villain in this movie.  Probably a bad call on the director's part since sequels are already suspect (is it a story or just a franchise?) and a weak villain, after the epic nastiness of Jeff Bridges' and Mickey Rourke's villains, didn't do the film any service.
140006922X|5.0|This is a great mind, beautifully trained and able to execute so powerfully.  Aslan takes the long known research from here and there and pulls it all together to give clarity today.  I give thanks for that clarity as it assists me in my teaching others, helping them find different perspective, to separate dogma from noetic and to rest more easily in the whole manner of things in our world and universe.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is a great mahjongg game. Runs very well on my Kindle Fire. I've tried other mahjongg games &amp; this remains my favorite. The tiles are colorful, easy to see, and imaginatively decorated.  You can play in quest mode where you follow a comic book type adventure story searching for an ancient relic, or just play games on your own. You can also create more than one player so, for instance, if you finish the quest mode story, you can play through it again.  The ads are not intrusive, they're only on the splash screen, and as this developer makes a lot of other good games, I like being aware of what else they offer. Overall this is a well-designed game and one of my favorites.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Really enjoyed this funny light book.  Local content always a good understanding of plot and characters,  Talking of characters there were well drawn and larger than life,  The term &#34;project&#34; was a bit of a fun statement.  The plot was easy to follow with a few twists and turns and of course the ending.  Good holiday read.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|Great game, though once you finish all the levels, it gets pretty boring.  Controls work well, and this is tons of fun.  Sorry to those who missed it on the free app of the day...
B0084AXZK0|3.0|I had no preconceived ideas when I starting reading this book. A friend rated it 4-stars & since it was written by Oscar Wilde, I thought I'd give it a try. It usually takes for me to read about 50 pages into any book before I find that I truly like it (or not). At page 51 I wasn't enjoying the story as much as I hoped. As a perfectionist I MUST finish whatever book I start reading & I dragged my heels to finish this book. At one point it became slightly more interesting, but not enough to make me want to read this book again. This is definitely a one-time reader for me.

0451196716|4.0|The Long Walk is actually the first novel King ever wrote, back when he was a college student around the age of 19 or 20. It falls under many genres, including Dystopian Sci-Fi, Survival Story, Psychological Horror, and to a lesser extent a coming-of-age story. It follows a teenage boy named Ray Garraty and his experiences during a yearly walking contest known as The Long Walk, hence the title. The contest is simple enough, and the reward for winning is absolutely fantastic, simple out-walk all the other contestants, which are 99 other teenage boys, and you win whatever you want, for the rest of your life! Sounds great right? Well first let me tell you the fate of those who end up getting \\"ticketed\\". During the course of the long walk if you walk under 4 mph you end up getting a warning, if you end up getting three warnings you get a ticket, which doesn't mean you get sent home with a ticket in shame, it means you get shot to death by the mute armed soldiers on the half tracks riding alongside the walkers. The only way to avoid such a grisly fate is simply to win. The other supporting characters in this story are Peter McVries, Hank Olson, Art Baker, Collie Parker, Gary Barkovitch, Scramm, and the cryptic Stebbins. All of them have their own unique personality and reasons for why they joined The Long Walk. They all bring something different to the tragic tale, for better or worse, the main antagonist being Barkovitch, who constantly taunts the other kids about \\"dancing on their graves\\". But back to the main plot, the story is very psychological in nature and delves deep into the mental states of the various characters as they come to terms with the fates of their own fates and the fates of their new-found friends. It is a brutal, grueling read, and surprisingly mature for a novel written at such a young age, showing that even in his youth, King was a master of the macabre. While I did enjoy the novel, a can't award it 5 stars because it's so dark, cruel, and depressing, not to mention a tad unrealistic when you really think about it, that I'm unable to view it as a masterpiece, even though it comes close. By all means, check this one out! You have been warned though...ing, not to mention a tad unrealistic when you really think about it, that I'm unable to view it as a masterpiece, even though it comes close.

B00EJU8ZIG|3.0|As other reviewer's have noted, Pure Heroine presents a fairly solid album from what many would expect to be a one hit wonder.  However, what seems to be missing from the effusive praise of other reviews is a note on two particular items:<br /><br />1.  While stylistic comparisons to Beth Orton and similar artists are appropriate on a variety of fronts, such comparisons fail to address the fact that the music on nearly every track is so similar as result in most of the tracks seeming to blend together.  Other than &#34;royals&#34; most of the tracks fail to distinguish them by varying tremendously in style or tempo.  There is a lot of slow, pounding base, which isn't a bad thing, but that should be a starting point rather than an ending point.<br /><br />2.  As someone who is officially NOT a teenager (someone who actually buys CDs and spent much of my teen years in actual, bonafide record stores), I don't relate at all to some sixteen year old who talks about her stress over aging not just on one song, but on four.  Seriously.  While some immaturity is to be expected by an artist so young (e.g. No one understands me, etc.) Lorde plays the themes of aging, responsibility, and lack of socio-economic privilege to a point where they appear either to be obsessions for her, or, more worisomely, manufactured.  In any case the themes are so heavily pushed I several places as I think many people who are older than twenty may find it distracting, and frankly, just too overwrought to take seriously.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|The first volume of Angry Birds.  This is where my son and I got hooked.  If haven't played any Angry Birds games this is where to start.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|Finally an album that let's us have an inkling of the power of her voice that she displayed in the talent competition.  I was disappointed in her previous albums because it seemed she had been so over trained that she was not allowed to let her voice soar as we all know it can.<br />  Buy the CD, turn up your sound, sit back, and enjoy.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Intriguing and fast-paced so it's an easy and enjoyable read.  Great moral questions, if you read for a book club.
B000OCXIDK|5.0|This book was a glimpse into a time when things were so different.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It's ending was a nice surprise.  I didn't see it coming.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|*contains spoilers*<br /><br />Like some of the other reviewers, I found the character development to not quite be up to what I was expecting. Sorry, Mr. King, but I wanted to know more about the motivations of this True Knot. Yeah, I got that Rosie the Hat once had a \\"rube\\" name, but what motivated her to be the evil bitch she is as the leader of the group?<br /><br />I also found Dan's unloading of his \\"rock bottom moment\\" to be subpar and pretty much a flat out lie. Dan Torrance wasn't really ashamed of taking booze money from Deanie's wallet. That wasn't what ate him up inside all those years. Dan was ashamed that he couldn't/didn't help the obviously abused child and the child died at the hands of his uncle shortly after. Anything short of admitting what truly was his \\"burden,\\" is cheating fans and ultimately, the writer who is a recovering alcoholic himself.<br /><br />Other than that, I actually enjoyed the book and his answer to \\"what happened that kid from The Shining.\\" It had a bit of King's old punch with a lot of the more seasoned King. Is it as good as the original (which I reread in preparation for the new book)? No, but I still found it kept me interested until the end. Would I recommend it to others? Yes, for the price of the kindle edition, it's most definitely worth it.<br /><br />Oh, and the nod to Joe Hill's NOS4A2 character, Charlie Manx, was cute. If I remember correctly, Joe Hill also makes a nod to this book by mentioning \\"The True Knot.\\"

B00DYOOGYK|1.0|Why do all of the modern games have to be violent?Before you download a game like this consider the negative psychologically affacts it will have on you. Games like this that glorify death and murder so that the game creators can make a few bucks are having a very large negative affect on our society.

B0080K3CYI|3.0|Although the story line was good I found it quite repetitive at times otherwise a good read and makes you think.  I like it when a book makes you think about how you would react and what you would do in the same situation.
B0042JSSVI|3.0|I have read other Robert Harris books and I found Pompei slightly disappointing in context to his normal excellent books. I am aware that I am in the minority but albeit that is my view. I found James A Michener factional books a better read
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Since I was much younger when I read The Shining,  and having read every Stephen King book ever published, I thought perhaps I'd be a little less \\"taken\\" by this novel. Silly me, even at my advanced and jaded age, Mr. King, as ever, gets 5 stars for yet another excellent excellent presentation. Thanks, Dude!
B006P5U6OY|5.0|In brief. It's a film that opens ideas about who and what we are and it peers ahead into the future. It's an existential trip with a spiritual interface. Richard Linklater, writer and director also has made other brilliant films such as Before Sunrise, Before Sunset (brilliant!) and Before Midnight.

B009AMAGXK|3.0|So I purposely made myself read the book before I watched the movie, because I wanted to really understand the world it took place in, and it's a topic I'm a huge fan of.  The book was amazing, the authors created a fantastic world for this timeless romance story to take place.  But the I saw the movie and realized what people were complaining about.  No, the movie isn't bad.  It actually has EXCELLENT art direction - whoever filmed the shots and picked angles and put together set was a genius.  It's got the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen on screen so far. The acting was also phenomenal.  Not the southern accents - I felt like everyone was overdoing it just a tad.  A little too hillbilly.  When I realized half the cast was from the UK, I got more respect, because their accents were more proper than the American cast, for whatever reason.  Especially the actress who played Lena.<br /><br />No, the problem lies in the heart of the story - the storytelling itself, and the rewrites.  First off, it feels like the button is held on fast-forward through the entire film.  But then it would randomly, awkwardly, slow down on key moments.  Other important story elements were rammed together in an effort to tell a story that should take 4 hours into 2.  This is what made the film suffer so much.  It had the perfect cast, it had the special effects budget, it had beautiful art direction, but it didn't have the budget to actually adhere to the story from the book.  In the end it makes changes that cheapen moments, kill long storyline arcs without a thought, and merge character awkwardly or eliminate them altogether.  Even as far as making some who are bad, good.  Or so under-utilized that it doesn't matter anyways.  Then there's the ending...which doesn't resemble the book's ending in the slightest.  Sure, it would be recoverable for a sequel if they wanted to undo how it ended in the film, but since it didn't do well enough to warrant a sequel, we're stuck with a movie that kills the great story of the book.  I'm usually not a book purist - I loved the Hunger Games movie even after reading the book.  I loved Harry Potter films.  But this just isn't as salvageable as those are, and I can't make excuses or look past things.  You kill the story, you kill the movie.  So unfortunately, it isn't good.  Why is it still three stars for me?  For the actors/actresses and whoever directed the film to make it look so stunning.  Those two are saving graces.  Otherwise, I really really hate to say it, but you might appreciate having better memories of these characters written in pages, rather than having their tale torn apart on screen. =(t kills the great story of the book.

B00AEUPOVQ|4.0|Top notch ensemble cast.  Beautiful locations.  Wry and nuanced use of humor.  Amanda Root delivers her role with her usual excellence; it is always a delight to see her in action!
B00FEN1C50|4.0|The movie itself is pretty standard science fiction and the cast does a great job filling in the classic archetypes: the hero that needs to regain his mojo, the damaged heroine, the unfaultering leader, the brash younger pilot, the crazy scientists, the ridiculous bureaucrats, etc.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this movie doesn't translate well from the giant IMAX 3D screen down to a living room (2D) TV.  Even in HD on a 55-inch screen, the power and scale of both the jaegers (giant robots) and kaju (giant monsters) are missing.  This movie was made for giant 3D screens.  My recommendation is to buy the 3D blu ray and play it on the biggest 3D screen you can find.<br /><br />As for the bonus features - there are 2 short documentaries.  The first lasted about 10 minutes and consisted mainly of Guillermo Del Toro discussing the various characters and why the actors fit the traits he was trying to find.  The second documentary is about 4 or 5 minutes long and contains much of the same footage as the first but with the director discussing the story and some filming techniques.  Both features have some interesting b-roll of an early table reading of the script and many between-take green screen moments.  I don't think they're worth paying anything extra and will likely be included on the disc version.
B00F56AZK4|4.0|I think it is cool because I like how u get to pic how big your pieces are and I like how you get to take a picture and do a puzzle. What I don't like about it is that u have to pay for most of everything.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|As usual, Nicholas Sparks delivers a great story.  This one was nice as it was not so unbearably sad as The Notebook or Message in a Bottle, but very heartfelt, believable and satisfying.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Not the classic zombie movie, based on the book (world war z) if you read the book, you'll like the movie, even if it doesn't follow the book literally, I totally recommend it.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|I'm a sucker for animal tales told by animals which is what drew me to this book.  Very touching and thought provoking.  This book has all the elements I look for.  Love, compassion, pain, redemption.  Most importantly it made me pause to think and feel.  I highly recommend and will be reading this authors other books.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have it plugged in to the back of my receiver, which does HDMI switching to the TV.  Streaming quality is great, supports Dolby digital, buffers quickly, and no hiccups during playback.  Nexus 7 interface for Netflix and Google Play is a pleasure to use.  Great companion for Google Play Music.

B00992CF6W|5.0|All I can say is , so totally completely positively perfectly Amazing  out did yourself, mojang. Congratulations you brilliant people
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I had to give this book 5 stars for the suspense that built throughout the book and the way the author connected all the crazy dots at the end.  I continued with the series and purchased the next book (Wayward) but now have to wait until 2014 for the 3rd installment.  The plot was very interesting and creative, and unlike most books I read.  Great series so far!
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I don't normally read this type of book. My director recommended it to the team.<br /><br />I found the story hard to put down. It only took a couple days for me to finish.<br /><br />Instead of technical details presented in multiple forms, information is presented in story form.<br /><br />If you work in it you need to read this book.  If you don't work in it you need to read this book and share with your CIO.<br /><br />@BeachBum
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I grew up on Stephen King and The Shining (the book, not movie) was always one of my favorites, so I was worried that I'd be disappointed in this sequel. Not to worry. He's written another great book that stands on its on merits. Scary, funny, and full of heart, I found myself completely caught up in this amazing story and I highly recommend it.

B00DY951RQ|2.0|The Dylan Self Portrait Deluxe Edition is a massive ripoff. I bought it because I wanted the Isle of Wight concert, previously available only on poor quality bootlegs. To get what I really wanted I had to spend nearly $100. I could have bought Another Self Portrait 2 CD set for about $15. Why didn't Columbia put out the Isle of Wight concert alone as a 1 disc Bootleg Series issue? Instead they packages it with a worthwhile 2 disc set helping redefine Dylan's worst album, Self Portrait, an unneeded remastered version of Self Portrait and a book of unexceptional pictures that mostly look like contact sheets from a couple of photo sessions.None of the pictures gave me insight into Dylan the man.<br /><br />The Isle of Wight concert was not one of Dylan's best performances. It is only useful to those of us who bought Dylan bootlegs and who wanted a significant concert in his career. Sound is fairly good and overall it was a satisfying listen.<br /><br />I found Another Self Portrait Bootleg Series Vol. 10 to be an excellent addition to my understanding of the Self Portrait album and period. Many of the tracks are far better than what was found in the original. There are also excellent tracks not in the awful Self-Portrait. I don't know what Dylan and Columbia were doing but, but with better track selection, it could have been an excellent if not a great album.<br /><br />Unless you really want the Isle of Wight c9oncert, save your money and by the $15 2 disc set.

1442362537|5.0|Stephen King has always had an ease with the notion of the mind having more powers for some people than for others.  Little Danny in The Shining possessed such powers and the ominous presences in the Overlook Hotel wanted him for them.  Now he's grown up with more typical life problems and while he's dealing with them he's contacted by one whose powers exceed his own.  Never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined the sequel to The Shining taking this path, but I'm glad it did.  If you read this, recognize that you'll never look at RV's on the road in the same way.

0143145010|5.0|I've never had the occasion to visit a Titan missile silo, but I feel that I know the corridors of the installations almost as well as if I'd been there.  Eric Schlosser weaves his descriptions of military hardware and latent danger in with the lives of those charged with staffing our nuclear arsenal.  He includes such touches as the news of the day and the music of the time.  The story of the Damascus accident is woven through the book as a thread of one near-devastating disaster among many other &#34;events.&#34;  People are fallible is the core take-away for me and it may be for you.

B00406UK7S|5.0|No this isn't Gladiator or Bravehart, but this is a very good movie. I watched it on Netflix (love, love, the Roman era) and anytime you put a Roman Legion in Britain it makes it even better. Not a huge plot to the movie- it's pretty straight forward. I find it a very interesting take on what may have happened to the &#34;9th Legion&#34;- Michael Fassbender is great in it and the background of Scotland is just breathtaking. I enjoyed it enough that I came over to Amazon to buy it and add to my collection.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is a great app considering it was free! There are many levels and even if you pass you can try again to get three stars (which is hard!). Stars are based on fast time!
B00EV4EUT8|1.0|Hollywood seems to create fictional accounts of history they know absolutely nothing about and far too many viewers accept lies and misrepresentations as the truth.<br /><br />This movie producer seeks to demonize a great American who helped make this country as great as it is today. Watching this movie serves no meaningful purpose other than serving only to undermine the viewers' faith in America.<br /><br />Facts demonstrate that the real story of the White House butler is not about racism at all. Eugene Allen, the White House butler served eight presidents from 1952 to 1986. Mr. Eugene Allen lead a quiet life, was married to the same woman for 65 years and had one son who served honorably in Vietnam. Mr. Allen never quit his job in protest. He worked in the White House thirty-four years and rose to the highest level available in White House service.<br /><br />Sadly, this movie is a representation of nothing more than Hollywood's wish to believe something about President Reagan, Mrs. Reagan and the White House that was never there.<br /><br />Ronald Wilson Reagan, while serving both as governor and later as president, did substantially more for minority communities than any president before or since and he helped to move both California and this nation into a far more balanced position.<br /><br />Unlike the Jane Fonda version of Nancy Reagan in this distortion of the truth, it was Mrs. Reagan who invited \\"the butler\\" to dinner as a guest and it was Mr. Reagan promoted Mr. Allen to maître d'hôtel, the highest service position.<br /><br />This movie is a very sad excuse to spend either your time or your money on.

The only things that need to be added are a better nether and Redstone. I have gone to the nether, and the tiny little spire is really boring and unattractive in my survival world. Also, Redstone dust should be added, although, it doesn't have to be functional yet. I have Redstone veins going straight through my mines and I would love to be able to mine them and get items from it. I would also love it if caves were added along with lava pools. Also, could giant mushrooms be added, and maybe biomes? I don't care about xp or villagers or enchanting.<br />Please consider putting some of these features into the next update!!!
