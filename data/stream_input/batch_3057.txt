B00BTZN91C|5.0|Fantastic album.  In my opinion it is one of their better albums.  I have been looking forward to i since Feel Again came out earlier this year and I was not disappointed.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|It was great for the whole family! My children range from 11 to 1 years of age and everyone was thoroughly entertained. I laughed out loud and appreciated the strong family bond of the characters.
B000002LE6|5.0|While there are some who are irritated by the whole album being a single track, remember there are tracked versions out there. I own two versions, both were purchased on amazon. The first one was the classic album series, in which five prince albums were included in mock lp packaging. In other words they were in card sleeves that mimic the original album artwork front and back. Ironically, Lovesexy is the tracked version so that isn't staying true to the \\"original/classic\\" concept. but I won't argue, and there is also a version from Germany that is tracked. It's easy enough to find if you look for it. But for those who give this album one star because of that, you need to pay more attention. it is shown as one track on the product page. However, I can understand how it might be frustrating, but know this: Prince was growing tired of fans who only followed the top 40 hits. His fans (in his eyes) were the ones who listened to the whole album, the others are just pretenders. Anyone who has ever listed to a prince album, let's use Sign O' the Times as an example, will realize that the best stuff never makes the radio, as it's contrary to contemporary commercial leanings. But, who cares. I have the album, so I won't be listening to the radio for some time. So he wanted people to not just listen to the hits but to be swept away by the experience. he would later use experience in some of his album/single titles, to let you know it's not just about one song.<br /><br />That being said, I must say the first time I listed to this album I didn't know what to think. Though generally with prince you have to listen to it several times before some of the music sinks in. As the songs are a bit complicated and layered and sometimes the casual fans pass over real gems because they just didn't \\"get it\\" the first time. But, then the second time, I just laid back and relaxed (I did some odd jobs that summer, and after a hard day's work I picked up a cheap tape player so I could listen to this album...as my main box was broken) what I found out was that from \\"eye no\\" to \\"Positivity\\" this was not just an album as much as it is a journey. But, I should add that this album is one of those albums that if you are in the right receptive mood this album will blow you away and take you to places you've never dreamed of, but if you're not in the mood it comes off as a bit meh...though I hate using that term.<br /><br />Every song flows, even if it were tracked I would doubt that if you listed to it at least once from start to finish you'd never just listen to the hits anymore. As this album is an experience, an expression of joy. \\"Eye No\\" is a bit like Let's Go Crazy as it's a semi-gospel tinged song giving you the feeling of a light hearted sermon, alphabet st. puts the fun in funky. Glam Slam seamlessly keeps the sexiness flowing and keeps your ears happy, then we get to Anna Stesia, a beautiful song that can't really be explained by words, it touches your soul. it's like an aural waterfall, a baptism and the most uplifting song he had done up until that time. Then we get to the social commentary that is Dance On, a fun, clever and energetic number with the drums sounding like gun fire...which fades into the gorgeous Lovesexy. A great title track that adds a bit of mystique to Prince's already engagingly-quirky persona. No one can scare you or please you the way Prince can. by this point you're along for the ride and you're not getting off until the album stops. When 2 R in love is well served here, while it did flourish on the black album it seems more at home here. It's prince at his ballad-falsetto best, and then we get to I Wish U Heaven. if you can find the maxi single of this song, he extends it into two extra parts. All are great. but this song here is short and beautiful...the lyrics are great, the vocals lush, as if the spiritual waterfall of Anna Stesia has emptied into still pond and in this pond you are so overcome with joy that you feel as ifyou could swim an ocean, if at the end of the swim you had the same pay off that Positivity brings. A Brilliantly written ode to what makes us human and how everything can be positive if we only have faith and by the end of the album as it starts to fade you'll realize you're not just a fan you are now part of his inner circle, those who get his albums and those who love the strange yet satisfying journeys that he takes you on. You are proud to call yourself a member of the new power generation.<br /><br />while many find conflict in Prince's dalliance with the profane and the profound. There is no reason why passion and sex and let's face it basic human behavior can't coexist with the Love we have for God and his creations. It's those contradictions that once studied explains how everything is a part of who we are and we are all a part of God. so let's sing of the beauty of this life and not dwell on the negative, that is the lesson that Prince is trying to convey and one that he wishes you to listen to from start to finish without skipping.  Not having tracks makes it hard for mixed cds/tapes. but in the end it's not about how we get there, but where we are going to, and trust me if you open yourself up and keep an open mind this album will take you not where you want to go but where you need to go, someplace deep inside...where positivity grows and where everybody knows \\"when love calls you got to go\\"....this feeling's so good in every single way...so feel free to join in.
055357342X|5.0|Any fan of fantasy will enjoy this series.  It is very subtle in it's use of magic and the supernatural, leaving it very believable.  George R.R. Martin keeps you on your toes by regularly allowing main characters to see extreme peril.
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|Loved the original Sprinkle when I got it as a FAOTD. Recently saw this one and debated about buying it. Demo was super fun. Luckily I waited and got it as the FAOTD just a few short days later. The aiming mechanics have been tuned a bit. The graphics are still crisp. And this one adds a few new twists such as boss battles (an active character causing havoc at the end of each set), water refills, among others. If you liked the first Sprinkle, this one is definitely worth getting as well.

006202406X|3.0|This probably doesn't count as a review, this is just me blowing off A LOT of steam over this book. Maybe a few gifs or memes strewn in along the way, and you should know I only use those in the most extreme of times.<br /><br />The follow up to this book was insane. Fans. US FANS, were absolutely just DYING for this. Over one year we had to wait for Allegiant, only to be delivered something just entirely off what we were expecting/wanting. What have we ever done to you to deserve this kind of ending?<br /><br />You know, it started off alright. Very Divergent-ish kind of start. Started in a way that made me feel: \\"everything is gonna be okay!\\". Everything was even alright until say like the very, very end. Like last 50 pages.<br /><br /> BOOSH. That was how the world went after that lovely bomb of an ending. Thank you so very much Veronica Roth. Honestly, how am I supposed to even watch the movie next March now? I was looking forward to it so much!<br /><br />You might have noticed I'm not mentioning the beginning or middle of Allegiant. Well, you can expect Divergent level writing, lots of suspense, and lots of stupidity amongst our characters. But yeah, as I said, everything just seems a lot more bearable compared to the ending. If V ended it better, this book would have garnered a five stars. You know what I can compare this to? Requiem. Everyone remembers the ending to the Delirium series by Lauren Oliver right? We were all just like \\"WHA--WHA--HUH???\\".<br /><br />Yes. Expect something inspirational at the end of Allegiant. Don't be expecting a perfect happy ending. Prepare yourself for disappointment and angry tears.<br /><br />My first reaction to this was to just sob.<br /><br /> The second reaction was acceptance.<br /><br />The third reaction was reevaluating reaction number two. Reaction turns into the utmost anger. I finished Allegiant the day it came out. There's a reason this \\"review\\" hasn't come out until now. I just didn't even know what to think after it. Mind = Blown.<br /><br />I'm sure lots of people will be really terrified to read Allegiant after this rant, but I do want to give you a little bit of assurance. I'm sure some people will be perfectly content with the ending to Allegiant, and might even praise V for having the, ahem \\"BRAVERY\\", to end the series in such a way. She sure did have guts, I mean, I'm sure some diehard fan is going to be showing up at her front door with a stack of complaints. That is why I'm giving this 3 stars. I can't ignore the good parts of the book that were in the first 400 pages, and I'm also sure there will be plenty of readers out there who won't be happy with the ending, but will just accept it as right. Then there will be the people who will just sit back with a big \\"REALLY\\" going through there minds.<br /><br />You should read this, you should. It IS the ending to Divergent after all. Every fan deserves to know how it ends. Just brace yourselves.<br /><br />--Steph @ A Walk on Words (Review also available on my blog with gifs and memes strewn across)er it.

B0089LOG02|4.0|A part of American history I had never heard about. I thought this was well written in that regard but overall, a predictable story line in regards to the two main characters.
B00503BN1M|4.0|It's a cute movie<br />I had watched it before but enjoyed watching it again<br />Funny but not pointless<br />Acters were all good
B003G4W49C|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  It is beautifully written, exciting, and touching.  I read this as a teenager and wanted to read it again before the release of the movie.  This time around I think I had a greater appreciation and connection to the characters.  Card creates a futuristic world that feels plausible even 20 years later.  Very, very well done.
193355021X|5.0|This is essential reading for anybody who wants to understand how the Free market economy works and how it compares  to the Central planning economy. This book lays perfect case against liberal left-wing government intervention policies. I particularly like the next chapters :\\"How the price system works\\" and \\"The role of the profit\\". After reading this book you will be able to easily knock-out any liberal activist with sets of arguments this book provides. Must read.
B000FCKPHG|5.0|This book provides understanding of our behavior towards main events we face daily. This behavior is determined by what Dr. Dwyer call it as mindset which she classified as either &#34;growth&#34; or &#34;fixed&#34;. The events are categorized  into the following groups:<br />1 Challenges<br />2 Obstacles<br />3 Effort<br />4 Criticism<br />5 Success of others<br /><br />Our behavior determines our growth at individual level and at the organization at large. Though the book talked in large part of it on application of this research in schools and academic contexts, it also addressed its application for organizations and sport teams. The application in organization besides the individual level is my main interest. However, understanding how sport champions respond to events based on their mind set, can be useful when dealing with others in organizational context or general life situations.<br /><br />The fixed mindset tends to be:<br />risk avert,<br />has low tolerance to setbacks,<br />believe that spending effort in face of challenge is sign of inability,<br />believe that people are endowed with fixed talents and abilities which can not grow,<br />always want to look smart even if they did not &#34;yet&#34; have the ability,<br />be defensive in face of useful feedback, and<br />feel threatened by the success of others<br /><br />The growth mindset tends to be:<br />embrace challenges,<br />persistent in face of obstacles,<br />deal with effort as the way to acquire the ability required to address challenges,<br />do not believe in setbacks, but it considers them as trials towards learning and growth,<br />be able to make use of criticism for growth, and<br />learn and become inspired by the success of others.<br /><br />Dr. Dweck provided valuable insights founded by solid research on the ramifications of praising the individual instead of the &#34;effort&#34;.<br /><br />What particularly resonated with me is the application of this research on leadership of enterprise adoption of Agile and Lean. This is because the book gave scientific foundation to understand leadership's behavior towards the transformation projects. I reflected Dr. Dweck's research on how transformation fails. Also, understanding how employees behave in organization based on the mindset of their leaders can be useful.terprise adoption of Agile and Lean.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|I was so so excited for this book to come out and was curious as to why there were so many bad reviews on it, but I didn't want to spoil the story for myself so I didn't read any of the reviews until after I finished the book.<br />WARNING SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!<br />I finished the book last night and was absolutely enthralled and devastated at the ending. After I cried my eyes out for a good half hour, I read a lot of the reviews out there and decided to wait to write a review until today as it was suggested. Now that I have had time to process everything that happened this series couldn't have ended any other way. I wasn't a fan of how the chapters were split between Tris and Tobias, as at times it was hard to remember who \\"I\\" was since the other 2 books were told from Tris's point of view, but as it got closer and closer to the end of the story that was made clear as to why it was done that way. I, like most others, am a fan of happy endings and at first was hard to find that in this one, but really the story ended exactly the way it should have. The people who gave this story bad ratings didn't like how the story ended so therefore gave it a bad rating. Please ignore those ratings and read the book for yourself before you decide what you think.<br />All I have to say is Tris is brave and is a hero and I wish there were more people like her!

B0007Y08PQ|5.0|I LOVE the extras the second disc provides.  Interviews with the actors and parts of the movie that ended on the cutting room floor.  Including a scene where Data fights two villians.  Jonathan Frakes (Cmdr Will Riker) directed this movie.  The movie was shot at Mammoth Mountain in California.  Several of the actors said they would return there (there is a ski lodge on the other side of the mountain from where the film was shot).  The architecture was fabulous.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|This last entry in the Divergent Trilogy is everything you'd expect from Roth.  Her characters breathe and bleed and grow within you as you race with them to conclusion. It is at turns heartwarming and heartbreaking, but always, always there is heart. I loved this series and mourn its end, but am thankful for the experience....
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Excellent book. Love jack Reacher. Once you start, it's very hard to put them down. You end up reading long into the night.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|in today's world where everyone has a cell phone or should I say smart phone, we need a way to transfer what we're watching as far as YouTube and movies to watch television.

B00FSBW2L6|5.0|Fives stars all the way!!! A story of redemption and hope told in a manner that is racy and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Christoph Fischer tells this story in such a manner that it places you right in the middle of the family feuds and stresses. Wonderful characters with ulterior motives mixed with manipulation and deception are ingredients for a fascinating read. Written so well and detailed that you could actually feel the countryside, feel the dirt under your shoes. It was easy to imagine Anna and her manipulative ways. I found myself at times talking to her and trying to stop her from her evil ways. Enter Markus a loving, kind character who must face his inner being and find true self through the mist of the chaotic family in which he live in a world where things are no longer how they were. Learning, growing and accepting himself for himself.<br />This book covers it all. Success, wealth, greed, envy, jealously. In other words a typical dysfunctional family. One you root for, one you cry for and one you thank God that you are not in. Christoph is a great writer. I am now looking up his other works and can’t wait to read them. I recommend this book highly!

B00BD99JMW|5.0|If I could give this book 10 stars I would.<br /><br />This is a very hard book for me to review.  I want to do it justice, and I hope I can.<br /><br />Veronica Roth's dystopian trilogy continues with ALLEGIANT. In both DIVERGENT and INSURGENT Tris narrates the novel from her point of view. This time around, Tris and Tobias alternate the narration. The reason this becomes necessary is made clear near the end of the book.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: THE REST OF THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.<br /><br />This book was un-put-down-able.  There were times when I wanted to throw the book across the room. (I refrained because I was reading it on my e-reader.) I had to take a break a few times after an intense scene, but I couldn't stay away from the story for long. The plot flow was logical and the characters' reasoning for doing things was explained well.<br /><br />Both Tris and Tobias are guarded individuals, and it shows in their thoughts and speech. There is not a lot of elaboration; they say what needs to be said and give you the information you need to know and not much more. This is consistent with growing up in their Abnegation faction.  Self-sacrifice and not drawing attention to yourself, in speech or in dress, are attributes of the Abnegation. They both chose Dauntless in the choosing ceremony and their actions are in line with this choice. Both Tris and Tobias are constantly on high-alert and actively looking for danger at every turn. They have witnessed and participated in too much death and destruction to be trusting of anyone or anything.<br /><br />I cannot separate the themes in this book from my own Christian perspective, so I will make no attempt to do so. Through the creation of factions, uprisings, brain washing and memory altering, those in charge of the city or the \\"experiment\\" are constantly trying to re-mold human nature to fit their ideal. Ms. Roth demonstrates time and again that no amount of behavior modification, serums, or slaughter of the genetically damaged can change or repair human nature. Their feeble  attempts to eradicate \\"sin\\" fail every time. Instead of looking outside themselves, to the God who can redeem them, they try to change themselves on the inside. Only those characters who realize the futility of this, and learn to love one another in spite of their faults and forgive each other find true peace.<br /><br />While the ending did hurt, it did not ruin the story for me. Tris is consistent in her selfless nature and her death is not without meaning. She accomplished her goal to stop the Bureau from destroying the \\"Chicago Experiment\\" and showed forgiveness to her brother by her agape love. I am reminded of what the old Amity woman in INSURGENT told Tris. \\"It isn't about you. It is a gift. You cannot earn it or it ceases to be a gift.\\" She believes that she can be forgiven and gladly goes with her mother.<br /><br />Although there is a lot of tragedy, I find the ending hopeful. Tobias ultimately overcomes his fear of the zip line and honors Tris's memory.  Tobias is the more \\"damaged\\" of the two, but even he realizes there is reason for hope. We can all be mended.etically damaged can change or repair human nature. Their feeble  attempts to eradicate \\"sin\\" fail every time.

B00475AYJQ|5.0|The Wise Man's Fear picks up where The Name of the Wind left off, somewhat mercilessly. If you haven't read The Name of the Wind recently, do that first then consider his book, you will be lost without that knowledge. If you have read The Name of the Wind recently, read this book now!<br /><br />The Wise Man's Fear is book two and day two of Kvothe's story. We learn a great deal more about his time at the university with all the friends, professors and enemies we've already met.<br /><br />There isn't alot of new ground broken in this book but the pacing and rhythm seem so much more mature than the first book that it's a delight to read. I think this was the best read I've had all year.<br /><br />If you have read The Name of the Wind, read this now. If you haven't, even if Name of the Wind wasn't great in its own right, it would be worth reading just to get to Wise Man's Fear.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|A raw and honest look at one of the most influential figures of all our time, and all time. I most enjoyed learning about Jobs's many contradictions, and studying how those contradictions resulted in great products. My favorite example: Jobs wanted to create products that allowed his users to express their creativity, yet he set tight parameters on what they could do with those products. As a creative person, I think I speak for all artists when I say we do not like others to set boundaries for us.<br /><br />Somehow, it worked. I am not Apple's biggest fan, but I respect Jobs and what he left behind.

1451695195|5.0|This book is just a wonderful book.  I appreciate the author for writing this book from his own experience, which is why I enjoyed it so very much.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I feel like I have to start this review with a quick note...I know that a lot of people disliked this book, but I think it's mainly because they're upset at the ending. That's fine that you didn't like the ending because it's now how you thought, but please don't bash Ms. Roth, who is an amazing author. She has complete creative license to do whatever she wants. She can kill off whomever she wants, and write the story how she sees fit. And if this ending was how she imagined this series ending, then it's good enough for me. Was I upset at the ending, yes. Any rational person would be. I cried and cried, and then cried some more. I literally couldn't believe what just happened. But I also expected it in some ways (which I'll get to later in this review). So overall, I don't care if you complain about the ending, but just stop bashing Ms. Roth because there's a HUGE difference, at least to me, between bashing a book and bashing an author.<br /><br />Anyway, I personally thought this book was fantastic. There were a couple of things that I really didn't like, which is why if I could, I would give this 4.5 stars. However, overall, I greatly enjoyed it, and am very sad that this series is over. Let's start with the dual POV first. I loved being able to read from Tobias's perspective (but seriously, who wouldn't). I honestly wanted to read more from his POV then Tris's. Ms. Roth did a very good job at showing us the real Tobias, who is completely separate from Four. He's not as strong as he would have the world believe. Tobias is suffering and unsure. This glimpse into his true character made the book so much more enjoyable for me, and his character much more realistic. War changes people, and I for one am grateful for the inside look. Tris is struggling just as much in some ways. However, she is stronger, and ready to take on whatever may come her way. She thinks things through, but at times acts rashly. Her character was also very realistic to me, and while I didn't like her POV as much as the previous two novels (which I think was largely because of Tobias's being in this story as well), it was still a great look into her mind.<br /><br />This leads me to one of the things that I didn't like. I thought the dual POV was very poorly done. At first, I could easily tell the difference between Tris and Tobias's POV's. However, as the story progressed, it got harder and harder to tell who was actually talking. I found myself going back to the beginning to double check who was supposed to be talking because the voices sounded similar. Usually, you could tell who was who just by the setting that character was in, but when Tris and Tobias are in the same setting, it just got downright confusing. Dual POV is hard to pull off, but I was expecting a bit more from Ms. Roth on this front because I do think she is a great author that has an amazing talent.<br /><br />Next up is the setting and plot. I will agree that this was one of the weaker aspects of this book, however it wasn't that weak. Granted, I didn't enjoy this book as much as the other two, but this is also a completely different book revolving around completely different terms. Chicago is changing after Jeanine's death and Evelyn's rise to power, and this isn't necessarily a good thing. This is a very fast-paced book, but there were times where it was lagging. These parts easily could have been cut out, and the story wouldn't have suffered in the slightest. At the same time, I flew through this book. I wanted to keep reading to find out what was going to happen next. The circumstances are different in this book, and I think Ms. Roth did an excellent job at pulling everything together. All our questions are answered except one (at least in my mind). We find why this all happened (and why there were factions), we find out about Edith Prior and Tris's mom, we find out what it actually means to be Divergent. Basically, we find out the truth. I know that some people really disliked thisportion of the book, but honestly, I feel that what Ms. Roth did made a lot of sense.  I think another reason I liked where Ms. Roth took this book is because it speaks to the science person in me. Being a Biology major in college, this whole thing just clicked with me in a way. I don't feel that in anyway was this a cop-out. While it could have been a little bit better researched in some aspects, it still was a interesting and creative direction to take the story.<br /><br />Now onto the ending. First let me talk about this \\"sex\\" scene. I interpreted it as they did have sex. I'm not putting this under spoiler because you can go into any review already and find this out. However, it was confusing as heck by what she meant. I guess it's really up to the reader to interpret what they want, but this part of the book could have been done a whole lot better. This also goes for the romance in the book. I know that Ms. Roth put it in to appease readers (especially because of what happens at the end), but I thought a lot of times the romance was out of place, and just didn't fit very well. In my opinion, there was actually too much. The climax of this book blows you away. There's no way to lessen the blow or anything. You will cry and sob and think it's unfair. Should you not read this book solely because of this reason, no. You need to read the book. But just know that the ending will literally shred your heart to little itty bitty pieces, and you'll need at least a 2-3 day recovery period. This being said, I actually completely expected something like this to happen. Never once in this series has it been sunshine and rainbows, and to expect the ending of this book to change anything is silly. This book is about a war, and in war there are many many casualties. Sometimes people who you don't want to die, end up dying, while the people that you can't stand live long and happy lives. But again, this is exactly what happens in war.<br /><br />Ultimately, I thought this bookwas great, and even though it wasn't as good as the previous two, I still thought it was an amazing end to this series. The title could have been better (I mean I even was coming up with other titles for this book while reading), but don't let other reviews hinder you from enjoying this novel. My best advice is go into this book with an open mind. Don't expect everything to work out perfectly and remember the world that this series takes place in. Our world isn't perfect, so you can' expect the ending to work out perfectly. I can't wait to see what else Ms. Roth writes because I know that she is a great author that has a tremendous talent.

1609611543|3.0|I do seem to lose weight when I cut down on carbohydrates so wanted to give this diet a try.  Calories DO matter and this author would have you believe that you can lose weight without worrying about the calories as long as you stick to his plan.  I do agree that there is something with carbohydrates, insulin, and obesity.  If I have a slice of toast for breakfast my blood sugar drops so much that I begin to shake and need a boost to bring it back up.  However, if I have an egg and some berries I'm fine until lunch.  I'm trying to incorporate his ideas with watching calorie count too.  I was surprised there is no nutrition information given in his recipes.  One would be lead to believe that it is low in calories.  So, I made the cheesecake recipe and when I had a bite it seemed so incredibly sweet.  I then went to my Weight Watchers page and used the recipe builder.  One 1/8 of a slice packs 450 calories!!! If you use regular sugar, 550 calories!  Beware of some of the suggestions.. full fat cheese, nuts, olives are all VERY fattening.. It's the same story.. have to take in fewer calories than you burn in order to lose weight.  Don't fall for the claims in this book.. just my opinion... now I know why the first week despite all my hard work exercising I only lost 1 pound.

B009ZQJ1G4|4.0|Equillibrium is no [[ASIN:B0012PDVQ2 Blade Runner]] but in it's own way it is revolutionary to the science fiction genre. There are plenty of places to go for a synopsis of the film so I will skip that but it is visually before it's time and it includes many elements of good science fiction that many film makers can only dream of including unpredictable but followable story plots and a hero fighting a power structure that would make Orwell or Bradbury proud. All in all this may not make anyone's best movies ever list but if you are a fan of science fiction then this is definitely worth watching and it does not fail to entertain.

140006922X|5.0|I'm going to be deliberately brief and seriously incomplete on what all the book covers... quite a lot! It ranges from details of Jesus' life to the milieu of Jewish apocalyptic fervor and seething rebellion leading to and through the great war with Rome in 66-70 CE, to Alsan's view of the transition from Jesus' teachings into a very different Pauline Christianity!  I suppose the \\"thesis\\" can be boiled down to a couple sentences or so, and I will give a couple excerpts that may be representative of Aslan's major point (or thesis).  In being brief, I want to emphasize that there is a lot to be learned from the book which is important toward gaining a better understanding of Jesus, the Gospels and the formation of Christianity in its earliest stages in the first century.<br /><br />In an ideal world, one could wish that the book-reading public would also take the time to read \\"Jesus books\\" that are more careful with conclusions that should be labeled as opinions or speculations. Such books should be peppered with \\"We can't know\\" (more than Aslan's is), and would be by experts that professionally specialize in this area of history, particularly the field of New Testament scholarship.  But such books (and there are plenty!) are seldom particularly readable for a broad audience.  And since we often do \\"judge a book by its cover\\", or author, we tend to read mainly those we sense will reinforce our existing beliefs.<br /><br />So take this review as a recommendation to read the book, for sure!  Its sales have demonstrated it is \\"striking a chord\\" beyond that prompted by the media hoopla and some stir within academia -- I think mainly in \\"biblical scholarship\\" though perhaps more broadly.  For one thing, this is a fascinating, readable book on topics that can easily bog the typical \\"lay\\" reader down.  The issues involved are complex and controversial on many levels, largely because there is so much to piece together from relatively little information.  And what informationwe have, specifically on the earthly Jesus, is almost all in the form of stories (a core narrative laid out first, apparently, by Mark in the Gospel ascribed to him, followed by variations in the other Gospels).<br /><br />Though many Christians don't see it this way, I think it's abundantly clear that these stories are a complicated mix of actual memory/traditions drawing an historical \\"frame\\" for the big picture, and extensive details created to paint out the rest of the picture in somewhat differing ways in each Gospel, reflecting differing situations and somewhat differing theologies as well.  This is the operating understanding of Aslan in Zealot as well, as I read between the lines.... I don't recall him stating this directly.  He does discuss many specifics of the Jesus story, sometimes explaining why he does or does not accept them as actual events.  His view is that key elements of the story, such as Jesus' place and circumstances of birth, were not thought to be historical even by their authors although they tend to carry that implication to modern readers.  Naturally, this approach will make his entire book suspicious to most traditional Christians.<br /><br />In a moment, I will wrap together Aslan's thesis (best I can find it represented briefly in his own words) with part of his conclusion, which I find quite interesting.  But on the way, let me mention that I judge the educational value of the book as high.<br /><br />Not only does it draw the reader along, but it includes a key drawing of the Temple area, a map of Palestine, and a couple helpful timelines for those who are reading carefully and care to remember key characters and dates.  The major stylistic and scholarly drawback I noted, with many others, besides his tendency to overstate or be unrealistically \\"certain\\" at times, is how the endnotes are done.  While I prefer notations be true \\"footnotes\\" (at the foot of the page), endnotes are fine.  However, in this book, there are no numbers in the text alerting you to further explanation or documentation.  There are many pages of such notes, but only arranged by chapter, so that connecting to any specific point in the text is very tough.  Still, the notes are well worth reading, as they present further interesting details, and often do document his sources.<br /><br />Finally, as to the core thesis of Zealot: Near the end of the chapter, \\"Who Do You Say I Am?\\", Aslan has discussed the way Jesus' followers, after the disastrous, religion-altering war with Rome, had to envision the Kingdom of God as entirely not of this world, their earthly-messiah hopes having been dashed:<br /><br />\\"But Jesus's kingdom--the Kingdom of God--was very much of this world.  And while the idea of a poor Galilean peasant claiming kingship for himself may seem laughable, it is no more absurd than the kingly ambitions of Jesus's fellow messiahs Judas the Galilean, Menahem, Simon son of Giora, Simon son of Kochba, and the rest.  Like them, Jesus's royal claims were based not on his power or wealth.  Like them, Jesus had no great army with which to overturn the kingdoms of men, no fleet to sweep the Roman seas.  The sole weapon he had with which to build the Kingdom of God was the one used by all the messiahs who came before or after him, the same weapon used by the bandits who eventually push the Roman empire out of the city of God: zeal.... Armed with zeal as his weapon, he will [upon entering Jerusalem] directly challenge the Temple authorities and their Roman overseers over who truly rules this holy land....\\"(p. 144)<br /><br />In what may be a surprising revelation of at least part of the reason for Aslan's continuing strong interest in Jesus, and perhaps the main motivation for writing the book, in his conclusion he states what could be echoed by many liberal or progressive Christians:<br /><br />\\"Two thousand years later, the Christ of Paul's creation has utterly subsumed the Jesus of history.  The memory of the revolutionaryzealot who walked across Galilee gathering an army of disciples with the goal of establishing the Kingdom of God on earth, the magnetic preacher who defied the authority of the Temple priesthood in Jerusalem, the radical Jewish nationalist who challenged the Roman occupation and lost, has been almost completely lost to history. That is a shame.  Because the one thing any comprehensive study of the historical Jesus should hopefully reveal is that Jesus of Nazareth--Jesus the man--is every bit as compelling, charismatic, and praiseworthy as Jesus the Christ.  He is, in short, someone worth believing in.\\" (p. 216)

This is a plastic piece that can extend and does make the classic screwdriver sounds.  The end has a normal black pen tip as well as an &#34;invisible ink&#34; tip that the blue light can reveal.<br /><br />This is more of a toy then a serious prop.  I would prefer something a bit more firm and realistic for my Doctor shenanigans, but the next best option, the 11th Doctor's screwdriver, is not appropriate for my getup.<br /><br />If you want a 10th Doctor screwdriver, this is really your only option.  If you want the best made screwdriver and don't care which Doctor you get it from, I suggest looking at River's or the 11th Doctor's choice.

0060557818|2.0|I read Neil Gaiman's \\"American Gods\\" recently, and loved it. So when I saw \\"Neverwhere\\" on the cheap shelf at the local bookstore I picked it up. For a book that is only 370 pages I thought it would never end. It was Gaiman's first solo novel, so I will cut him some slack, but this text is just simply not that satisfying. The high praise for it mystifies me.<br />\\"Neverwhere\\" is an imaginative novel, with some interesting character ideas and plot devices. But it is not a well written novel. It verges on boring, and the characters are flat and for the most part go nowhere. It is almost like Gaiman wanted credit for the clever idea, but then did not know how to do anything with it. The last 100 or so pages are very weak structurally and the plot is contrived and the ending telegraphed from a mile away. The story is supposed to be a character arc where we see a man become who he was meant to be, but the internal life of all of the characters is so flat and undeveloped, that when the \\"high\\" points for the characters come you don't care.<br />In short, \\"Neverwhere\\" would have been an intriguing graphic novel. In fact, that is what Neil Gaiman has written, just without the pictures. As a standalone text, it fails.<br />Skip this one. Read \\"American Gods\\" instead.

0553386697|1.0|This deceptively simple book sits uncomfortably on a flawed and dangerous premise: that so-called left-brain thinking is the only way to view the world and anything not left-brain can be adequately described in reductive terms and \\"integrated\\".<br /><br />From the perspective of my prejudiced, biased, poetic world view, this book degrades and ignores the role of imagination (also called soul, psyche, heart, that part of us beyond brain, whole or otherwise) and thus denies the value of our most precious asset.  It comfortably forgets that the part of us that gets emotional is indistinguishable [in thought] from the part that perceives the world and walks in it.  It ignores the fairly obvious truth that the \\"two sides\\" are not equal or even opposed but rather \\"left-brain\\" is only one tiny town in a vast largely undiscovered country (ask Heraclitus if you don't believe me!)

0515153656|2.0|Couldn't finish it :-/ The writing style is plain, and the plot punctuated with contrived scenes. For example: A small-town police department arrests a drifter, and releases him. A few days later one of the cops (who's also one of the hottest women in town) sleeps with him and invites him to live with her. Another fellow has his balls fed to his wife. We're told of a third, found dead with a pint of semen in his stomach. And the protagonist is a super-man in combat, but the fight scenes display little knowledge of (or research in) fighting.

B00E9P959O|3.0|I come to the remix with a mixed bag, and after listening to it side-by-side with the original CD pressing, I walk away with nearly the same sentiment. What I thought was going to be a knockout punch to the \\"loudness war\\" only turned out to be a tap on the wrist.<br /><br />There are two issues at stake with the original Vapor Trails: 1) an improper mix, and 2) an improper master.<br /><br />Mixing is the process of taking the isolated tracks that were put to tape (or, in a digital age, put to digital storage), and mixing them together. Typically the four different parts (vocals, bass, drums, and guitars) are recorded separately, and then layered together to create a final mix. Not every band does it this way, but most do. The sound engineer responsible for creating the final mix \\"raises\\" or \\"lowers\\" the different parts (or \\"tracks\\") to relatively different degrees. The mixing also includes things like the stereophonic placement of the different tracks (left channel vs. right channel), etc. Were it not for this process, the vocals would be drowned out by the drums and perhaps guitars (think of a concert you may have attended where the band didn't set up properly...). We've been told since shortly after the original VT was released that there were problems within the mix, and rightly so. This remix of the album is excellent in that certain aspects of the original which were drowned out are now extant. Specifically I could tell right away that the cymbals sounded brighter and crisper, and the cymbal decay was a bit longer than before. I also noticed Geddy's singing \\"higher\\" in the mix than before, and any backing vocal tracks he made also seem to jump out.<br /><br />What bothered me most about the original VT was the mastering job. This is when the final mix is taken and put down to a CD. Typically there is some equalizing during this process, but since the mid 1990s, mastering has taken a turn for the worse, and albums are mastered \\"too hot,\\" or \\"too muddy,\\" or \\"tooloud.\\" Keep in mind that loudness is different from volume. Loudness is the overall average sound level given to the final mix as it was put onto the CD. Volume is what you and I do with our volume knobs, naturally. The trend has shown such increasing levels of loudness, that the breaking point of a CD's capacity for loudness is often breached, creating distortion. Sometimes this can be detected when a person hears crackling in the speakers despite nothing being wrong with the equipment in question. The original VT suffered from an awful mastering job, let alone a sub-standard mix. The loudness pumped into the original VT surpassed a CD's capacity almost throughout the entire album, creating a \\"wall of noise\\" effect and digital crackling sounds all throughout. The problem I have with VT-Remixed is that while the mix is improved, the final master is only marginally improved. The dynamic range of the remixed CD is still sub-standard. I was hoping for much more dynamic range with this recording. Most importantly, I was hoping that a band would have listened to how awful the loudness wars have become, listened to the input from fans, taken an objective viewpoint to the lunacy of the loudness wars, and done something to correct it. Sadly, any improvement in dynamic range resulting from this remix is minute.<br /><br />All in all, it is better than the original VT, but only nominally.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The acting the history the backgrounds the costumes the plots..can't get any better than this show..no wonder it's so wildly popular
B007Q476KU|3.0|Entertaining, but had areas where it was not real believe able. The whole brigade got deafeningly quiet when Albert was whistling at the end to call Joe. Lots off action, weak areas.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Eady to install and does a great job.  I would give it 5 stars if it worked with more apps.  Works well with the Chrome browser on my computer, but not compatible with the Chrome browser on my Samsung Tab 10.1. (tab 1).  You Tube works on the tablet, as does Netflix, but can't stream music already on my tablet.  Definitely recommend it, and as it's a Google product expect it to eventually have lots more apps.  Judt watched 7 hours of football streaming from my computer, flash crashed once but Chromcast worked well.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm am so excited that candy crush saga is finally on the kindle. You don't know how much I'm been waiting for this. When i found out i was literally jumping up and down. It is SO addictive and one of the best free games on the app store !!! :) :) :)
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Extremely fun! I like the cute way they tied the star war characters into the birds! And having a pig vader laugh at you if you fail is hilarious! Also the added cartoon clips are nice too. A great game for kids and adults! Definitely 5 stars!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have always liked match 3 games, but I love this one. I like it because you don't have to play on line or you can play with facebook friends. If you like match 3 games you will love this one.
B007ZRZF8I|3.0|It`s fun and all but when I am about to beat level 2 it goes to my home menu and the letters are all over the game menu.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|Can't believe how much I enjoyed a story about a kid. We'll done Mr Grisham I expect this story to make it's way into school curriculum if it hasn't already
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's on the Amazon store and it is so much fun! There's so much levels! I can't believe it was FREE! I highly recommend this game
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game is great. The graphic style is beautiful, controls are spot on and gameplay is fun. Worth every penny.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I hadn't read a Jack Reacher book for awhile and had forgotten just how engaging they can be.  The story was not that interesting to me yet I could not stop reading.  The characters are good with the Jack Reacher character being the best.  My only question is - why cast Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher?
1455523550|5.0|I love this book...It was a fantastic read. Plus it arrived very quickly and it was in great shape. I was very imppressed!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Do you want to know how to load a Thompson?Or shoot  a Springfield?This is the app for you! Get this app!!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I thought Divergent and Insurgent were great---an exciting story with well-developed characters, structured plot, and good pacing.  The plot was well-packaged, and these books were, overall, a pleasure to read.<br /><br />Allegiant, however, is pretty much a train wreck.  The plot is out of control; there are multiple climaxes and it recklessly changes direction. The conclusion is completely dissatisfying and left me thinking, \\"Really? What a waste of time and money.\\"  But what's so tragic about this disappointing conclusion to the trilogy is that both Divergent and Insurgent are forever ruined.  With her third and final installment, Roth managed to pull out the rug from the entire trilogy.<br /><br />Don't waste your time, money, or good memories of the first two books.
B00EP22QKG|5.0|Unvarnished is exceptional, and continues to sound like I expect from Joan Jett and I have not yet heard any music by Joan that I don't enjoy.
B003Y01JL2|4.0|It's an incredible album, I bought it for a friend's birthday on September 37th, the delivery was on time and the packaging was adequate to protect the fragile vinyl. There weren't any scratches on it and the music quality was great, the song transition was also seamless. I definitely recommend this to all future buyers.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|needs more options for power ups but good time passing game. it does give you the optiion to purchase things but they are generally .99 or so
B000A88F22|5.0|Bought it cud I needed a reminder on when her happier days were. Truely believe she was in love with him. Love the bonus Cd with the songs and all the applies and behind the scenes stuff. Wish Britney was still happy
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I like the concept of this app as it can function as a backup alarm clock, but I felt there weren't enough sounds/tunes to pick from. Otherwise it does exactly what it claims to do! I like the simple look without a ton of extra, unnecessary stuff on the screen.
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|Twisted yet almost believable.  What does that say about today's politicians.. right?<br /><br />My ONLY beef is that they film a lot of this series in Baltimore which only matters in that DC doesn't have buildings that tall and some of the buildings in the background are quite known there.<br /><br />The acting is at a level one would hope but does not often see in television.  This is one of the best series out there right now.
1594746036|4.0|I didn't order this for myself, so I can't really review the book myself, but my wife really seemed to enjoy it and had the book with her all over our apartment for the first couple of weeks after we got it. She must have enjoyed something about it!
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|It wasn't quite as funny (a little more serious) as the last two movies, but I liked the ending. There was a clear story from beginning to end. I also liked that it wasn't very long. Stupid humor that makes you laugh, but not much to write home about.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Unfortunately, I happened to see the first Hunger Games movie before reading the novels, but fortunately it turns out the movie did a really good job representing the novel, so I don't have too much regret for that fact. I did read all three novels before the second movie came out, and it's hard to decide which one is the best. I probably think the first one is the best just because of the mysteries that remain. I'm not sure I completely like how things turned out in the later novels. Some decisions that were made in the storyline just didn't mesh for me, but it was still a really enjoyable series.
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|I love most sci-fi movies... and well most movies in general, but this one was dissappointing.  Very cliche story line, acting was sub-par, and it would've probably been more enjoyable if Will Smith had a larger part in the movie (didn't want to say more in case someone hasn't seen it and plans to).  The visual effects were ok, but compared to other movies in the genre, nothing special.  overall i gave it a two stars, because it gives you something to stare at for 2 hours, but there are so many other movies that are way better!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I remember watching my wife play this a while back. I ended up really enjoying it and wanted to play it myself -- and ended up completing every level offered. It's not really worth buying more levels since you get plenty of them for free, and they can get pretty challenging towards the end.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun and challenging games for all ages. It's hard from time to time. Wish I had infinite lives! Think it's a game anyone would love!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I always wanted to play this game and this was a way to try it for pretty cheap. I really enjoyed it! Thinking of all the crazy things you could use to accomplish your goals in this game was the best part!
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|So informative! You'll never look at carbohydrates the same way again. Dr. Perlmutter knows what he is talking about - I am so lad I bought this book!
B003UBTX72|4.0|Listening to book on CD, waxes on philosophic about drugs, music, rock and roll life, relationships, and is very entertaining.<br /><br />check the library. ha ha!<br /><br />I don't think I could sit with the book as easily as puttering around the house while listening to the book.<br /><br />Wow, Rolling Stones 50 years. Greatest rock and roll band.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|There's no moral to this story like Grishams other books, but this was an entertaining read! I would recommend it.
B00000AFWZ|5.0|There is a lot of great songs on these CD's. Some very obscure, some recognizable. Most of these you don't hear on the oldies stations, a must have for collectors.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This story of a successful, wealthy family has its challenges and tragedies which adds a strong sense of reality to a great era.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|My favorite. I really like this game. Keeps my mind relaxed. I play this game until I run out of my bingos. Need more.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|With so many games on your droid all looking the same this game really stands out. it's fun it's addicting and well worth the price. this coming from someone who does not normally like puzzle/match games. the only drawback is that it's rather short...hopefully they'll add more levels soon.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Great book. If you're a male you NEED TO read this book. Thank you to all the men mad women of the military who serve this country with their lives. This book will get you, just an awesome story of some of the toughest men on the planet. Enjoy.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|I ordered this arm to attach a 20&#34; AOC LCD as a 4th monitor to my Sim Racing and Gaming rig.  This arm is more than strong enough and is extremely adjustable.  It attaches very strongly and holds the monitor very firm.  The button you have to push in on the side of the top arm is a little tight and you have to put some force into it, but it works well.  If I were to have any complaint at all, I wish the arm would adjust just a bit lower than it does.  I tried removing the extension arm, but ended up re-attaching it as it didn't do a whole lot in terms of lowering the monitor.  This is really a unique problem for my particular use though as I was mounting it up on a top shelf and overhanging the monitor over the center of my 3 monitor setup below on the desktop.  I would not hesitate in recommending this arm for anyone looking for an affordable but high quality monitor arm.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|It was not the best game because when you tried to make the hair grow back it was not the way it was when you started.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Once you start, you cant stop!<br />This tame is so simple, its stupid. I hate my life has been sucked into it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Wow wow wow.  Love playing this game.  Love having to buy new things and dress it up in funny costumes.  I loved getting on different levels and following the goals and winning the goals.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|She loved WALL-E and still does but this is her number one now. If you want to purchase a movie for a child... even a tween, BUY THIS. Children everywhere LOVE this movie. Adults can have fun watching this too. Perfect gift for the upcoming holidays.
B000FC2KL0|4.0|Miraculously encouraging! Every new relapse was a different destruction, sobriety is an ongoing journey. I too have a dog that hasn't seen me high as well as friends and that is what keeps me sober.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|This is a fun new take on super powered humans. Was very Well written light reading that kept me guessing.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Awesome<br />Super awesome good awesome great awesome all kinds of  awesome May join the IMAGINATION to heal the two real name is James this weekend though y
B000FC12L4|5.0|The ending was a real twist and I did not anticipate it.  Usually I do, and I am glad when the author outwits me.
B00BOX0K0M|4.0|Works well on really bright days and on water. I would buy it again and if you do action with bright sun it makes a big difference.
0316204366|2.0|I have the Kindle version.  It has NO table of contents.  That is very bad.  There are no links from the footnote numbers in the text to the footnotes themselves.  Also very bad.  The tables are unreadable on the Kindle and cannot be enlarged.  Very very bad.<br /><br />I also have some issues with content.  The diagnosis of Goliath suffering from acromegaly doesn't ring true.  (Acromegaly enlarges hands, feet and face but not the long bones which affect height.)  And the suggestion that employers hire from less than top-notch colleges when they have graduates from Stanford and Berkeley applying to them does not match my own experience hiring programmers.
B00B2PHSIY|4.0|This does exactly as advertised. It works great. I would consider the macro in red as well but that is more an issue with the GoPro not the filter.
B00CWM3F4C|5.0|I said the same thing about their last release, epic! But I think the same way about 'devil's dinosaurs'. I really like AIC and their music is superior.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|This song is so full of energy and a good beat that it forces me to get up and dance! I can see myself listening to this song until I absolutely can't stand it anymore. (And that won't be anytime soon!)
B00FQAZ7PW|3.0|This sounds like pearl jam from the 1990's. I can hear the heart and soul from them again. More please.
B00F9040HU|1.0|I Wanted a New 3 match exciting game. Disappointed! Should have paid attention to the other reviews!  U should NOT OFFER this as free...then can't play beyond certain level...unless you are forced to BUY the game!  You don't even offer this to BUY  up front! I buy games if  not too high priced--under $4.  But will not be pressured to do so as U are trying to do, in this game!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|As we age there is a decline in many normal functions . I am an older adult that uses this game as a fun way to improve hand eye coordination.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Mostly well-written but predictable story that should bring a tear to your eye.  Some of the chapters are quite funny with fun characters and occurrences.
B009RH9J7W|5.0|Absolutely love it.  Only thing I would change would be to have a way to store the stylus for convenience.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I strongly recommend this to anyone who enjoys post-apocalyptic science fiction.  This was the most enjoyable read in quite a while.
1451695195|3.0|Pretty trippy book. Reminds me of soem acid trips I have heard about..But hey I wonder if what he felt and saw was &#34;his&#34; heaven or &#34;God's&#34; Heaven...Perhaps 1 day we will all find out.
159463176X|5.0|I have read all of Hosseini's books and enjoyed this last one as much as the first.  He masterfullly used &#34;stories&#34; to tell his story.  His characters are so alive and really help you to understand the Afghanistan 'day to day' life.  Enlightening! Moving!
B008CPZNL6|1.0|Flipboard is visually appealing and somewhat fun to browse, but it is not news it is censorship. It is an agent for pushing the agenda of a select few. The composers of the flipboard media do not care about what is true, only about what propagates their anger.
0399159347|4.0|Great read!  I had trouble putting it down.  Moriarty's use of imagery was so good that I felt that I was at the scene.  Her characters were very believable and &#34;human&#34;.
B0011UF79C|5.0|I needed this movie for a class I was taking and couldn't find it anywhere to rent. Being a movie collector, I thought it would be a great addition to my collection. I was not disappointed. Thank you!
B006N9XHLQ|5.0|In the last review I wrote here, I admonished Josh Lanyon to write better endings than the finale of the first four books in the Adrien English series, which all seemed to just stop with neither great emotional resonance nor catharsis. Just bland, &#34;it's over&#34;, type of endings.<br /><br />Now I understand why he did it. If you take all five books together as a single work, the ending of this one serves to validate the endings of all the others. Not that they were cliffhangers, tantalizing you to buy the next book in the series, just short intermissions.<br /><br />I say that because the ending of this book was nothing less than spectacular and left me profoundly moved and satisfied. I'm glad I made it through all five of them.<br /><br />There is a moment at the very end when Adrien lets out a wail - a monstrous release of pain and suffering, not for himself, but for all the gay men who have suffered through their lives in the closet, even to the point of their own deaths and that of others. It is heartfelt and powerful and sums up the five books perfectly.<br /><br />Josh Lanyon is, quite simply, a brilliant writer, a huge talent, and I&#34;m so glad I stumbled across his work. Please, if you read nothing else, read these five Adrien English mysteries - not for the mysteries themselves, which are not all that unique or extraordinary, but for the ongoing (and subtly revealed) archetypal account of the damage of the closet.<br /><br />Like so many others, I'm sorry to see this series come to a close.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's ok. I've played this type of game before but it was called a different name.  I admit, I haven't played the game enough to reach higher levels because it bores me. And I refuse to pay to play.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|Let me start by saying that I am a huge horror movie fan, and I'm hard to please when it comes to a good horror film.  \\"The Conjuring\\" is based on the case files of husband and wife ghost hunters, Lorraine and Ed Warren (Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson).  When Carolyn and Roger Perron, along with their five children, move into their new home strange things begin to happen...The youngest daughter starts seeing an imaginary friend, another daughter begins sleep walking and banging her face into a wall, mom wakes up every morning with bruises appearing all over her body, all the clocks in the house stop at 3:07 am, and then the really bad things begin to happen.  Enter Lorraine and Ed Warren to evaluate the house to see what is going on.  After a brief tour of the house, Lorraine has visions of death and quickly realizes the evil in this house is trying to attach itself to the family members.  Without going further into the plot, I'll say that the terror in the house escalates fast, leading to a truly scary, and satisfying conclusion.  James Wan, director of \\"Saw\\", has done a fantastic job of creating a scary and creepy horror movie with enough jolts, jumps, and gore to keep genre fans happy.  With all the garbage remakes, torture horror, or ridiculous PG-13 rated horror movies that have flooded the theaters over the years it's good to see a true scary movie come along.  Fans of classic 70's and 80's horror films will definitely enjoy this.  Highly Recommended!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Great game but limited to Max level 35. Then have to buy. No! I do not want to BUY!  Therefore I gave it only 3 star rating.
B001RP1G0U|5.0|This comedy/drama is great for anyone who has been in the situation or knows someone who has.  Dating in midlife shown at its funniest and most true to life.

B00BS1VVIU|5.0|Elena Tonra's vocals and lyrics are not for the faint of heart. She lays herself bare and if you accept her invitation to reside in the raw spaces of her heart you will be richly rewarded and perhaps your own heart will be strengthened by knowing that this small woman can have a giant impact on the deepest parts of your psyche. How's that for hyperbole! But don't take my word on faith, check out the truth for yourself: listen to the samples, or better yet, check out her Tiny Desk Concert on NPR. If you accept her invitation, you will have found a wonderful companion who will have your undying loyalty - you will never want to leave Daughter.

B000S5BUXI|5.0|Ever hear a band that has been around for a while and think: &#34;How have I not heard about these guys!&#34; That's the case with The National. Imagine Leonard Cohen's love child forms a band, that's the sound of singer Matt Berninger, supported by a band that knows how to create just the right accompaniment to his haunting poetry. I bought their latest, then within a week bought the rest of their catalog. I just play them all on shuffle and they flow together seamlessly, carrying you along in every emotion under the sun.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love the game but was forced to buy bars to continue at game 35. Didn't like that.  The cost was minimal but I didn't like the idea of having to buy to continue.  How many more times is that going to happen?  Well, it happened again at game 53.  What gives?

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Ok, lets face it...we are reading this because of the titillating sex and the gorgeous hunk of a man described in this book. But after a bit lets face it NO woman could survive all that sex and so often!!!! Oh Please!!! I guess it's a book about every woman's fantasy mixed in with every man's fantasy too. Really, what man wouldn't want such an adventurous woman!! And what woman wouldn't want a drop dead stunning stud with Millions to boot! But frankly the sex got to be a little monotonous by about the 3rd book. I wonder about the woman who wrote this...how does she know so much about SM and sadists? What made her write this type of material? And how the heck are they gonna make a movie out of this! It would have to be rated XXX. In the books the couple are 21 and 28...oh really!! Their vocabulary far out weighs mine and I'm 55!!! They act and sound like they are more like 31 and 38( Actually more like 31 and 48)!!!. Not sure why the author made them so young maybe because it is still believable to be a virgin at 21 but not at 31?? What ever!

B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|For those who like superhero fiction, Steelheart is a welcome addition. Very few authors do this genre well, with writers like Clines and Grossman a rarity.  Most of it is written by authors with no grasp of the subject matter.  Sanderson's book grabs you right off the bat with a compelling lead and a great twist of the usual superhero story. It was one of those rare books that kept me up all night to finish it.  I can't wait until the next story from the \\"Steelheart\\" universe.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|it is nice to finally have this on the Kindle Fire officially. i had to go by third-party before. fun game; however i would like more than 5 turns at a time. whatever. i guess it helps keep me in check and keep the game &quot;casual play&quot; :)
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|popular game it seems could become addicted to it recommended to my sister and mom<br />and most of my friends

B00FAPF5U0|3.0|candy crush is fun to play with great graphics...but there are limits to how long you can play ..you get 5 lives then have to wait at least 30 minutes before playing again. I get about an hour of play time per 5 lives but i am anal about gettting three stars per level so i replay them alot.<br /><br />i will delete the app once i get to level 35. i am not going to connect to facebook, pay to play every thirty rounds, or wait three days playing extra levels to advance.<br /><br />i have found a neat alternative called candy deluxe pro...it is free to play...no lives to wait for and plenty of powerups on each level. there r a few ads when loading the game like the ones on words with friends but nothing intrusive....the graphics arent as good but they r suitable.....check it out
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|I like the latest update. I've used this app on my Kindle and on my Galaxy phone and it works equally well on both.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Must Read! Non-Stop action! I could not put it down!  Why did I wait so long to read this book???
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Its very well made and fun to pass the time. I loved the movie so its fun to build their little coral reef.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Great horror. Adult theme but very good storyline. Missed it when originally run. Now I can catch up on it all.
B0082FPIY8|4.0|Another thoroughly enjoyable and page turning read. I love every page of this book and felt like I was hiking right along with her - in a million years I would not have been brave enough to do what this young women did. She was brave and I found her story totally inspiring.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|If I could, I would've given this book a 1.5.<br />First off, I did not hate Allegiant. Although I was severely disappointed in the ending, I didn't hate it. It's the authors book, so Roth could do whatever she wanted to it. On the other hand, it's the readers who buy the book, and judge it. Since Insurgent, it was pretty obvious that Tris would do some selfless act and put her life on the line. Nothing about the ending was surprising. We all knew Tris would do anything it takes to protect the ones she loved. I could deal with Tris dying for an ending, but the way that she died was pathetic. In my opinion, if Roth wanted to end the book with Tris' death, the scene should be greater than what it was. It had to be well written and it had to grab the reader. Tris is the main character! Her death was weak.<br /><br />The book as a whole, was poorly written and paced. I liked the idea of splitting the points of view. If it was done better, Allegiant would've been an amazing book. Ever since Divergent, fans wanted to get a look into Tobias' head - and now they finally get it. The problem with double points of view is that each character HAS to have a distinct personality and voice. If not done properly,  the story just feels dull and flat. Roth did an OK job. There were moments in the story where I forgot who was talking until the character says the others name. Also, there were many holes in Allegiant. The world that Roth was building in Divergent and Insurgent was mentioned very little. Even the characters seemed to get pushed to the background.<br /><br />Finally, I completely understand why the fans hate this book so much. I feel like Veronica was just riding the new Divergent wave to push this book into #1. If she had taken an extra month or two to really make this book special and great, I would've been fine with it. I'd rather wait a little longer for a book, than have it sooner and be mediocre. On the other hand, I really do feel bad for Roth. All the hate she must be getting is astounding. With the movie coming out, this is really bad publicity. The first two books in the trilogy got such positive feedback that it must be shocking to her to receive tons of negative. I've read reviews where people say things like \\"I'm going to burn my books.\\" \\"I'm never reading any of her books again!\\" \\"I never should have read them!\\" that must really hurt Roth to read them. She has to find a way to deal with all this negative publicity.
0441172717|5.0|Wow. My brother begged me to read this book when we were young, my father having read it first. Being an author, I was immediately struck by the author's mastery of his message and it's delivery. Even if the book had no plot, simply following of the flow of the author's words would be reason enough to read this book. I've read only approximately 200 pages at the time of this review, but even if I stopped now, buying and reading from this book is already a five star experience.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|How can you NOT love this series??? We have the whole thing on discs and I am sure we will watch it over and over, catching new little twists each time!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|So, I almost never post reviews here but this book should have come with a warning. Everything you read in the other reviews is true - this is a beautiful love story. HOWEVER, it was so sad My husband said that I was doing what Oprah terms the ugly cry - when I was just describing the plot to him after I read it. While I was reading it it was a sobbing, can't breathe, wiping my nose on my shirt experience. Read at your own risk!
B00E7RZEI0|4.0|Fun game but feels sometimes a little too much solving the challenge for the sake of the challenge.  Just a little more story would make it a five star from my point of view.
1400052181|5.0|A textbook used by my son at school.<br />A very historic and needed tale for growing and grown citizens to read and be aware of.
B00EQNYOYU|4.0|Very cool album, be sure to check out the video for Came back haunted, it was directed by Dvaid Lynch.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Awesome app for any music lover. Its nice because instead of having to take the time to look up the artist and remember song tittle everytime you want to listen. Now its already stored.
031624662X|2.0|When this book came I was very excited. It had received so many wonderful reviews that I preordered and read it the day it arrived. Unlike a lot of people however, I never got into it. The universe that the author established is very interesting has a lot of possibilities for compelling stories. This story doesn't live up to its universe. I eagerly burned through the first quarter of the book waiting for a hook, waiting for something to draw me in. But it never came. I reread certain chapters thinking I must've missed something that makes it all so compelling but it just wasn't there for me. It's just not interesting, and nothing ever happens. Almost nothing ever happens. It's also hard to get into because the author never physically describes characters in terms of race, haircolor, skin color, height or sex. Some of that is intentional, but it still leaves the reader, or at least me, unable to picture anyone in this book. I like the Expance series as an alternative.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I thought it was a decent step up from the original temple run game. It still shared some elements such as the tripping,ducking,and speed, but this had mine carts and ropes too. I would have done 5 stars if they didn't have power ups or upgrades, I thought they could've left that out.
B000062YAY|5.0|Absolutely fantastic set! Slayer does great work (damage?!) on this two disc set. I love it. Worth every penny. Highly recommend to all metal fans.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|I was a huge fan of the movie. It was my go to movie on long plane trips. So when my husband urge me to read the book I said why when I know the plot and refer to the famous lines as part of my everyday language. But this book, wow!  It's was relaxing and flowed like a familiar walk with a few details I hadn't noticed before.  Copala was a genius and so was Puzo!  Incredible!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is the best game in the world:)!!!!!! I love how you can play on realms and stuff.You should definitely get it its worth it!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|What an interesting book. It makes you question quiet married life with children. I loved the way she fills in the blanks and gives the story from the perspective of many characters.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Nice and easy to get started. Instructions were great.  Tiles are easy to read.  Enjoying the challenge of more complicated puzzles.
B00B2GK4KW|5.0|After a bit of experimenting, I finally got the punch to work (trying to get a full 12&#34; circle).  Love it now.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|Love it.<br />This is undoubtedly one of the finest TV serials produced in the decade. Michael Hirst done remarkable job in blending fact with fiction, myth with reality without taking side with his protagonist. One of the best examples of 'poetic license' used judiciously. Personally, for a non-Christian and non-European like me it is well accessible and has helped me understand the the European history through very fine tuned perspective.
B00ET47USI|5.0|Love the animation. Really makes the game. Vibrant colors and cute creatures. Glad I downloaded it. Look forward to getting the other games written by the same author.<br />I like free cell too.
B008ROZAQU|5.0|I enjoyed this movie, John Wayne  is one of my favourite actors. He can do comedy and dramas.  If you're looking for something different to watch, this is the movies.
B001E7EONC|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, it was fun an fast paced. It dragged a little in places, but mostly it moved along nicely. The acting was good.
B00DXP7L88|2.0|While I initially refused to watch the final season of Dexter, I finally gave in and watched it for one reason: I really missed all of the characters.  I wanted to see Deb and Angel and Joey and Masuka, and especially Dexter.  Michael C Hall is one intense man, and I loved his interpretation of Dex.  Jennifer Carpenter is an extraordinary actress, in my opinion, and made Deb better than she was written.<br /><br />However, as I watched Dexter slowly ooze from a hard-core badass into a 14 year old girl (apologies, girls) with a huge crush, I could only stare in horror and repeat the same phrase, \\"What is he doing??? WHY IS HE TALKING SO MUCH?\\" I'm surprised we didn't see him doodling hearts and writing bad love poetry as he struggled to muster up the energy to find, much less kill, the bad guy.  \\"I don't waaaaannnnaaaa!\\" he whines, so instead he calls Deb to take care of it for him.  Ugh.<br /><br />I was actually glad to see Hannah... mistakenly thinking that NOW we were getting somewhere!  Imagine holding a brightly colored, shiny balloon.  Let it go and watch as the escaping air propels it to its demise, and there we have the Hannah story line.  She's such a devious vixen!  So... not even a wig, or a dopey hat to disguise her when she's a hunted fugitive? Not even one little plot twist to make her interesting?  Nope.  Instead, she's wasted on cooking scenes and ingenue-ish love scenes. Bleah.<br /><br />Oliver Saxon, played brilliantly by Darri Ingolfsson, was a wasted opportunity. This character had the potential to be THE most insidious villain of the series, the biggest challenge to Dexter ever, the most prolific killer and plot enhancer of the past 8 years.  Instead, he went from highly intelligent psychopath to bumbling oaf.  His ending was an insult to oafs everywhere.  Hello, flat balloon.  *sigh*<br /><br />The last 2 minutes (or so) of the very last \\"Dexter\\" made me wonder: Did the writers think that they were doing their viewers a favor by showing that?Because, just for the record, I could have lived without it.  Seriously.<br /><br />I could go on.  In fact, I kind of *want* to go on but I won't.  There are too many things to say, so I will stop here and go rewatch a couple of episodes from the first season, just to try and rinse the disappointment away.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Perfect old school solitaire
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A great read for any audience. Hits on what is truly important and how to find beauty in all of life's imperfections.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I can't quite get into it as some of his other books.  Sometime I think the publisher asks for a book just because he author is well known.  But the author many not be in the mood to write a really good book.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|this book is just so awsome funny and sad will some times make your eyes sweat but over all great book
B0000069NM|5.0|I've been coming back to this album again and again over the past ten years.  It never fails to impress and continually, to my amazement, surprises me after all this time.  It's got everything: funk, rock, jazz, weirdness--the band is really smokin' here, people.  The bass, the drums and, particularly, the Hammond B3 organ is so so so good, y'all.<br /><br />I've been playing guitar for many years and have come to the conclusion that Scofield is one of the best.  He might not play a million notes a second, but that isn't the point, is it.  The fact is he plays guitar like no one else I know.  His choice of notes and modes and scales is absolutely unique.  He is totally competent, in control and an amazing musician.  I saw him live here in Grand Rapids, MI five years ago.  I was stunned at how calm the guy was, how controlled.  He made it look so easy!<br /><br />It doesn't matter if you're a jazz aficionado or a rock fan.  This album will please both groups of listeners.  This album inhabits its' own unique space: somewhere between Kind of Blue or Blue Train and The Meters or Santana's Abraxas.  If that sounds like your particular brand of tonic, by all means pick this album up immediately.  Believe me, it will be in and out of your album rotation for years to come!  Money well spent, if you ask me.  What else can you ask for?
B00FRQ32N4|1.0|It will not download this game sucks i wish it would download so every body it sucks i hate if omg
B00F91G5BS|4.0|Not enough content of disease nor what caused it. Did not like that movie imitated life in as far as government making some people special because of their contribution and those that cannot contribute, send them away.
B0026PW67W|1.0|Seems to be a cheap knockoff of the one that Harry Potter actually used. I've spent hours repeating, chanting, and singing, 'I solemnly swear I'm up to no good' and tapping it with my wand to no avail. I thought one time I saw Dumbledore's footprints and name flicker but then I remembered he was dead. Sincerely disappointed with this product.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Definitely a must see movie. If you love marvel comics movies, this is one you cant miss. Its a movie filled with action.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|Well, as we all know, this is a cult classic, and oh-so-much-fun to watch and engage in the shows if you've ever been to one. Honestly, I thought I was going to have to pay fifteen to twenty smackers to buy this on DVD, but was delighted to see what twenty quarters from my change jar can get these days!<br /><br />Great quality, great movie, great price, and fast free shipping if you're an amazon prime member! doesn't get much better then that!<br /><br />Find this helpful? Please click below to give me some feedback on my reviews!
006202406X|2.0|I work at a library, and have been telling everyone to read this series, it caught my attention and it was almost Harry Potter scale for me to wait for the arrival of the 3rd and final book. What an amazing letdown. I felt that it dragged on and on, where I would expect some type of resolution for what they had discovered their new \\"now\\" to be....and then I would look and realize that I was only halfway through the book. The fact that I could repeatedly put it down for snack breaks etc, tells me that it wasn't the caliber that her two previous novels were. I too (like others) found that I would have to flip back to the beginning of the chapter to figure out who was \\"speaking\\" at the time. I was unable to distinguish who it was otherwise. I caught on after 3 or 4 chapters that I needed to take a moment to recognize who was the POV for the next chapter. It seems like there were so many opportunities and plot lines that could of been explored and \\"fleshed\\" out...but instead we have a book of meandering that ends with me crying like a baby....I felt that the loss of Tris came out of nowhere (for me at least).<br /><br />And now, I have produced a review that rambles along with the lines of Ms. Roth's recent book. I can't help but wonder if this was a rushed job, products of a popular and in-demand series that just got the Hollywood treatment.
B00DQZQPNM|5.0|You might wonder why I give this five stars yet I'm saying be careful. The thing is I bought this thinking the Kindle Fire that I had won in a raffle was the newest generation but it wasn't, even though I checked it against the serial number they go by. Still, I received the product promptly and in good condition. It is very good quality, when I bought it it was $40 which seemed a little expensive to me considering it's not an otterbox or anything. Yet I still think it's a good buy for it's sleek, sexy design and protection.<br />Like I said though, double check what generation kindle fire hd you're shopping for.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|Everyone laugh when I told them about the Son's. But I am I can get all the DVD's so I. Ordered them on my favorite site. The DVD's are in good condition worth the price which is very low. Well return.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Been waiting on this one for a while, and glad to say that it lived up to the hype.  Took about 10 minutes to setup using my iPhone.  Plugged right into an HDMI port on my projector, connected to power, and then used the iPhone app to actually setup the device.  Now I can stream Netflix straight to my projector and use the iPhone as essentially the remote to my TV.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Brandon has done it again created a book that everyone will enjoy. This time it's about super hero's that take over the world. If you are debating whether or not to buy the book do.
B00FPGSPQU|2.0|It's ok.. Just kinda beating a dead horse in ways. Had a few one liners that were funny but I would not spend money on this again.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|The above statement is one of the life changing take-aways I have from the book. Gladwell, uses a perfectly selected group of examples to explain the unique, and yet similar circumstances that it took for the Outliers to succeed. However, he takes away the mystery of their prowess while leaving them with some credit, but he does this all while teaching us that however we succeed in life is not because of our greatness but because of the great opportunities presented to us in which we choose to take advantage of.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Well written, don't usually like first person, but it put the scheming of the author and his character in the same mind, and allowed some editorial license and opinion giving on various social issues within the story. Flawless, just didn't blow me away.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Run the app on a Kindle Fire and it does everything I need it too. Glad it was the one I chose to use.
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|Really enjoyed movies like this always have, especially the fight scenes  .... I hope and cant wait for a sequel!
B00BKZUVGM|4.0|I just love it! There isn't really much more to say! Had me in tears :') really loved the whole series
B005IU1OMA|4.0|We have agreed that disc 1 is in the top 2 of best snowboarding videos we have ever seen. The cinematography and the action was beyond compare. This would have received FIVE stars, if disc 2 worked, unfortunately, it read as &#34;bad disc&#34;. My husband will not let me send it back because he is afraid we would never get another copy and he would have to live without disc 1 too, LOL. We highly recommend this, even if disc two doesn't work for you!
0517548232|5.0|I wish more people would read this book.  After I took all those economics classes in college and heard so many economic theories discussed in such complicated detail, I was happy to find that this book explained it all in simply, clearly and completely.  It amazing how much misinformation and misunderstanding there is surrounding this topic.  If you want to help you friends understand what is actually true about economics or just help yourself develop a better understanding of how the world works, this is the book for you.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Even though I can only understand nod about 80% of what they are saying, I love the program. Recommend it to all.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|I was not sure that this movie would be any good but I was surprised that it was actually pretty good.  We had family members of several different ages watch this and everyone liked it.  It is a low budget but fun to watch
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I like the game, but I don't like that you can only get 3 to 5 tries and then have to wait so many minutes to continue
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I enjoy playing this challenging game, it does test your aiming skills and is a good mind exercise as well.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|A surprising work from King. This is the exception to his typical style. Most interesting and well developed  story line.<br />Have already recommended this book to several people.
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|All I can say is I love this Studio Ghibli film. It's my new favorite, surpassing Spirited Away. According to my wife, it very accurately recollects the time period in Japan.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Good acting, creative script, beautiful people, scary bad guys...  what's not to like!  Stern fatherly guidance from Anthony Hopkins too.
B00CL0J99K|2.0|I can usually tell by the trailers if the film will be empty, action packed, exciting or lacking something.  When I saw the Iron Man 3 trailers, I got that feeling that something was not right.  I was not excited about the Mandarin, and I was even less excited about a non-Asian one.  I passed on this film in the theaters, and I saw the other two in theaters.<br /><br />They need to give this film a redirection or this franchise will come to an abrupt end.  No reboot is needed, just get back to the story of IRON MAN!  More IRON MAN (that is the title, right?) and LESS Tony Stark and even less of Pepper!  The 3 Spider-man films suffered because they had too much Mary Jane!  Women slow down and ruin action films!  Men have women in their lives, but keep them for the lovin and keep them away from the action!<br /><br />If you wanted to see this film expecting to see Iron Man, then you might want to watch another movie!  The least that you see in this film is Iron Man.  How can you have a film called \\"Iron Man 3\\" and hardly show Iron Man?  It was mostly about Tony Stark and his going without the armor.  I guess the producers of this film thought that recovering dope fiend, Robert Downey Jr. was the main attraction to Iron Man.  Maybe they placed too many bets on that, but I don't want to watch a super hero movie to NOT see the super hero, I want to see Iron Man.  You really don't see Iron Man and the little that you do see is half A.  Most of the armors are half done and they seem to get destroyed easily.  Also, the calling on armor pieces for anywhere is not cool.  Yeah, it may be easier to get the armor on instead of the briefcase, but it is silly an unrealistic.  The briefcase was Tony Stark and Iron Man!  It is also what made the character unique in Marvel Comics.  I guess they messed this up.<br /><br />I was not always crazy about the Mandarin, but if they were going to show him, I was expecting the classical Mandarin which this film fools you into believing that you would get.  Instead, you get Mandarin that has no rings and is one that I don't recognize.  I stopped reading comic books around 1988 shortly after Amazing Spider Man #300, so who knows what happened after that?  This film was dull and Hollywood needs to understand, that with super hero films, people don't have time to wait on lame enemies, we want to see as much of the hero as possible and we want to see the villains - interesting villains!  Do that and you can have winners.  More of Iron Man 3 and no one will want to see super hero films anymore.  Given that there are few options for films these days, they need to get these right.  I vote for Dr. Doom as the villain in the next one, along with a minor villain at the start.
B004LUS390|4.0|Very fun, powerful (has layers). Showed to my friend that is a design student, says she could definitely use if she forgot her paper. (Although she has a smart phone so will likely need a stylus). Used on Nexus 7.
1576754227|4.0|I read this book a few years ago.  It was a quick read and helped me focus on a number of areas that I might not have thought about myself. For the most part, it just motivated me to think about how I could be more efficient.  Not all the suggestions were as easy to implement as they sounded and I must say, it didn't turn me into a super-efficient person overnight.  But a few of the concepts stuck and come in handy once in a while.  So when my son was recently promoted to a new position, I thought it might help him make the transition more effectively if he had a way of thinking about how to organize his new responsibilities. I bought him a copy (because I couldn't find my old one) and I browsed through it quickly again before giving it to him. The advice still looks as useful as it did before.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|I admit it, I am a big fan of Malcolm Gladwell. He has the job I've always wanted, since my Sociology undergrad days. I've read all his books and this one didn't disappoint. My take on his main thesis of the book is &#34;when is bigger not necessarily better?&#34; Great examples and, as always, very illuminating and thought-provoking. I've already used several of the scenarios as examples within the course I teach. Thank you Mr. Gladwell! Please keep researching, writing and debunking the assumptions we make about the world.
B00E7SFAAG|1.0|This game is the biggest piece of crap I have ever seen. To much lag and glitches.I hate it and who ever created it might have lost tiger minds.
B004MPESSY|4.0|Rapes and tortures are hard to watch but at the time it showing you how awful are those rapes happening to women everyday.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's the best game ever , good to play when you bored or on break nice for your kids too. You will get addicted
0307740919|4.0|Beautifully and concisely written.  Shows how important our formative years and their relationships are.  Our lives have many influences but the early ones, or our memories of them, seem to be the ones of most value.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|worth 99 coins there's even  a zombie plague and a brain parasite  it's a little hard to unlock stuff so you might wanna buy the virus and play on easy until you get good enough to beat it but all over all its freaking awsome get it AWSOME.
0345529057|5.0|really enjoy reading them. Love the show, but the books give so much more detail. Highly recommend the time to read these books.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|As I got toward the end, I read more slowly- I just didn't want it to end. I loved it, and would recommend it to anyone who ever believed in magic.
B00003CXBK|5.0|product arrived in great condition with no damage. runs clean with no errors in dvd. great anime and I love the story.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|The main character plays several roles in the show and does a great job with each. Some are better than others, but the ones you really get to know will make you forget it's the same actress. The show also has a great plot that keeps you guessing. I can't wait for the next season!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This is a great little charger, it charges the phone quicker than my standard charger! So far it's working great! I gave some extra ones I bought out as gifts and so far I haven't heard any complaints, just praises to how well it works!<br /><br />The charges came quickly in the mail and were packaged good as I'd expect! Great company to deal with! I will gladly deal with them again in the near future! Thanks!
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|It's entertaining if you have nothing better to do, but definitely not a great plot to end this series. The first hangover was 5 stars, the second 4 stars and the 3rd 3 stars. I'm glad they didn't make a 4th and 5th.
B00EMGUT1I|3.0|I was really looking forward to hearing this new Motorhead CD.  There are a couple of rockin' songs but there are a lot of skippers.  A few a just a but to mellow for me.  I know Lemmy is getting up there in years and his music is starting to reflect that in my opinion.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|I thought the movie was great in special FX and all, but it didn't seem to have enough Survivors of the crash. It didn't seem like there<br />were enough actors for the plot. But other than that. I would say give it a watch, it's got a lot of action for one boy. Jaden Smith did a great job. So I gave it 3 stars!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I reviewed this game couple of days ago, but today I finished the game and have a lot more to say.....the tech that designed the levels is a genius!  First of all what makes it incredibly interesting....for one thing going from one level to another is NOT so straightforward....it's NOT like many other games, where you just &quot;graduate&quot; to one level to another.  Other games, make this transition completely mundane.  Here you have to advance to a level, but PAY ATTENTION, because what you run across in your current level you made in the next levels and you may have to go back and get something from the previous level!!  Hey, yes I was cussing and frustrated, but THAT'S what makes this game so great!  Look I couldn't wait to get back to this game everyday.  I recommend that you get the FULL version, you'll be glad you did.  Stay with G5 games for guaranteed entertainment.  DL
0385349947|5.0|Sandberg is right on! Women do not want to pay the social penalty of success. We need to change this. I think we will do so if we lean in.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Captivating. A real page turner. Surprises at every turn. Imagery held me suspended. Made me feel as though I was right there.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The fact that they make you wait once you get to a certain level unless you want to pay extra sucks looks like a money grabber I enjoy playing it but not to the point were I am willing to pay extra
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally it came to kindle. Love this challenging game. Easily get hooked on it. And much better on your eyes than using your phone to play it.
1442362537|5.0|I listened to this on my way to Canada and was drawn in right away  I read the Shining years ago and thought it should have a sequel and I think King nailed it the reader also was great I only wish it was on audio cds  instead of mp3 discs
B000LXQVA4|5.0|My 3.5 month old son absolutely loves this jumper! The springs are so bouncy that he instantly caught on to what he was supposed to do. I can put him in this for 25+ min. at a time and he is fully entertained. My parents bought him the baby Einstein jumper for their house. It is not nearly as &#34;jumpy&#34; and my son gets bored faster. If you are deciding between the two, the fisherprice rain forest jumper is the way to go.
0062059963|5.0|I'm so glad I decided to continue America's story by buying The Elite. A quick read, it left me eagerly waiting for the final novel, The One.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|I love this game and have it installed both on my phone and Kindle Fire. I think you guys should make a special Kindle addition because since you cant blow on the kindle that level you always loose.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I bought this for my wife, who fell in love with the movie and the music. She now has this in her car, her ipod and her phone. She loves this CD!
B003ICWTR4|5.0|I have seen Bruce live twice and he never ever disappoints. This was such a stunning performance and to think he has been performing for over 40 years. A must see for every fan, anyone who watches it must become a fan!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really like this game. it really supports the ideals and character of the movie. the minions are great and very funny.
B00005R23S|5.0|Having lived in NJ for over 10 year it was great to see The Boss perform with the E-Street Band, a quintessential rock and roll band, all members brilliant in their own right. They gel as a band like I've never seen before, could watch over and over....
B00B4Z5GDQ|4.0|Great movie for music fans.<br /><br />It gets technical in places... I love that.<br /><br />Just like Rock of Ages, turns out rock stars<br />like to drop F- bombs. Typical.<br /><br />Still, Dave Grohl is such an open hearted and alive soul,<br />He overcomes!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I Been waiting to long for the REAL Deal On KindleFire<br />Thank You Amazon<br />And If You Guys Are Looking For Another Game Play The Simpson Tapped Out :D
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|Fun, mindless mayhem. It is like Godzilla but without the cheap sets, actors in goofy costumes, and badly dubbed English.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is so fun. It's like the best game ever.if I could I would give this game 100stars. That&quot;s how good this game is. So it was worth every penny.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Veronica Roth how could you do this to us?!!! I can't say much without spoiling this but if you are  \\"happy ending only\\" kind of a person do not read the conclusion to this saga! Just make up your own ending for these characters and be okay with it. That said, Roth is again masterful in her storytelling and character building.  I didn't love the story she told but one cannot deny her ability as a writer and as much as I hated her ending, I really loved her books.
3406653642|5.0|It was what I expected. It's a Christmas gift for my daughter who is visiting Germany. Hope she likes it.
B001XUIBNO|5.0|Classic...Faye dunaway and Jack Nicholson... How can you go wrong.<br />? This is one of my favorites to watch on a rainy Saturday.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I bought this for my son-in-law who persuaded me to watch the show in the first place.  He saw the first two seasons on Netflix, but since the third season had not come out, he had missed it all!  He caught up rather quickly. This show is so well done.  I originally thought it would be all just blood and gore.  And it IS. But that's not the point.  It's about what you would do when something unthinkable happens, like the zombie apocalypse, which threatens everything in your life - including your life itself. Highly recommended. But don't start watching season 4 until you catch up.
B00ENS583O|2.0|A good book.  Lots of twists and turns.  Great to have Haller and Bosch in the same novel.  Worth the money
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|What can I say, this is a very riveting series. I know I will enjoy watching this over and over.
B00EEL0LGY|1.0|This game is nice with good graphics and all. But there is no multiplayer mode here. Which i was looking forward for. Amazon, please fix this. My device is samsung galaxy tab P 7500
1451695195|3.0|I did not care for this book--it was not what i expected at all--I would not recommend it to a friend
B00CL151G4|5.0|This show is very entertaining and interesting. I love the characters and the stories are well thought out and well written.
B000FC0OOU|1.0|What you need to know about the kindle version of the book is that it has been censored.  All the words that \\"Someone\\" thinks are obscene are replaced with the word \\"obscene\\" or \\"obscenity\\".  This is not mentioned anywhere in the description of the kindle version.  I think this in itself is obscene and would recommend you not buy the kindle version if you want an uncensored version of Hemingway's book.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I love this show. It is the most entertaining and interesting show on television. I look forward to future seasons.
B00FEHXISA|3.0|This movie was entertaining, to be sure. Lots of neat effects and some fight scenes. However, after two movies of &#34;character development,&#34; this movie fails to deliver on any front. The ending left me frustrated and an analysis of the movie reveals that the character went in a full circle; he was in no way different than when he started the movie. Everything is still the same in terms of what causes him distress. However, he no longer has an army of Iron Mans to help him since he destroyed them. The fact that they engaged in hand to hand combat with a foe that could magically disable them by touching their arm (Really?) was laughable.<br /><br />See it or rent it; I do not recommend this for purchase.
B009NG1Q96|3.0|Disclaimer: Before I make it seem like I'm totally ripping on this book, I'll be the first to admit I read it and was entertained enough.. Although neither book has left me with a good feeling thus far.<br />If you like the Twilight series, you will like The Selection series. I don't mean this in the best way.<br />The main character is perfectly imperfect. Try as she might to fail, things just seem to always work out for her in the end.<br />That aside, this is a love story featuring very unhealthy relationships, and it's hard to ignore that. The main character dishonestly juggles two guys, and then holds the threat of leaving over their heads when one of them doesn't treat her with the utmost honesty and adoration.<br />You find yourself rooting against girls who, on paper, may have better intentions than America herself.<br />In short: it's a simple tale of a girl stringing two nice enough guys along over the span of two (soon to be three) books.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I only gave The Room four stars because I didn't want the game to finish, I wanted more. I can't wait for The Room 2.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I have also posted this review elsewhere, and it DOES contains spoilers. Be warned. If it is removed (which I have heard Amazon is doing re:this book and complaint threads discussing it), I hope that at least my rating remains.<br /><br />Sigh. DNF. Wanted to love it. Didn't.<br /><br />EDITTED later in the day<br /><br />I was disappointed that they had sex. What can I say? I'm traditional. Fear of intimacy does not have to be primarily addressed through sex. This is the main reason I didn't finish the book. It disappoints me that our society equates sex with intimacy to such an extent, and that we hand it to the masses like a drug. And the masses have bought it. Many teens think it's the truth, and they give themselves away, certain they're in love and should share intimacy--until something goes wrong in the relationship and there's no bond to keep them committed to pushing through. Then it's on to the next one, and more giving ourselves away. I was disappointed, because I felt that with this development, Veronica Roth just added support to the current cultural trend. Disappointing.<br /><br />Yup. I'm old fashioned, I suppose. And I'll say this: The fact that something is commonplace doesn't make it right. Or helpful.<br /><br />I was disappointed by Tris' death. I've read the discussions about why it was so meaningful and poignant, (both selfless and brave; the true divergent nature of this particular heroine). I get that. But her ACTION was what was selfless and brave. Her death was only made so because she died as a result of the action. She would still have been what she always had been: willing to die in a selfless act of bravery, even if she had lived. Injure her, maim her somehow if you need to make a strong statement. But to kill her off? Disappointing.<br /><br />Overall, I felt completely let down. I committed to a series in which I saw great potential, and from which I derived great enjoyment. I watched Tris grow and change. She grew into a strong, gritty character throughout the first two books (even though she had bouts of neediness and instability). The Tris of Allegiant was not the Tris of Divergent and Insurgent. And this is a shame.<br /><br />I was profoundly saddened, after having waited for so long for the conclusion of this heretofore wonderful series. Oh well, I suppose that's how things go sometimes. Pity.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Reminded me of the 70's with the fondest of memories.  Good to know they are still going strong with great new songs
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Great game - needs more more goals to complete - update - my son and I played it a lot. Worth getting
B000002GVZ|5.0|i really love her wish there was more songs on it but for the price it was good, Fast shipping and cd in good condition
B008KNUKVI|5.0|If you love acapella harmonies you will love this album.  I liked all of the songs.  I look forward to their next album.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|SPOILER ALERT!!!!<br /><br />Tris dies so what's the point.  Stupid way to end a trilogy. Not reading your books again!!!  Why bother wasting time on not one book but three books to be totally disappointed by the crazy ending?
B0023SDPS6|3.0|Too much trashy talk. Nothing like the A&E version. For once I like the movie much better. Especially Sheriff Walt.
B00BMKH5NW|4.0|I had zero intentions of reading Fangirl, and I mean zero. I’ve been trying to avoid “over hyped” books, especially contemporary ones because contemporary is not really my go to genre so when they are hyped up I often have a not great experience with them. When Cass and I decided to do the Fall Into Reading Read Along we each decided to pick a book from our favorite genre, her’s being contemporary and thus Fangirl was added to my reading list. THANK YOU CASSIE &#60;3 Seriously, I would probably NEVER have picked this book up, even despite the outstanding reviews everywhere, and that would have been a crime.<br /><br />The main character, Cather, legitimately might be one of my all time favorite characters in a contemporary novel. The only other character that I even think holds a candle to her in my eyes is Caymen from The Distance Between us. I freakin adored Cather. She was such a strange, anxiety ridden, shut in type of girl but SO AWESOME. Her bluntness was hilarious. I loved her obsession with Simon Snow, I loved her awkwardness… I just loved her. Reagan was another character that was awesome. She is Cath’s roommate and her bluntness and stick-it-to-you-straight type of attitude really made her character. If it wasn’t for Reagan, Cath probably would have died at university(seriously, starved to death!) and their relationship was fantastic. Wren, Cath’s twin sister… well I didn’t like her. Maybe I didn’t like her because I couldn’t understand their relationship but I just couldn’t relate at all to the fact she wanted hardly anything to do with her twin sister. It was just weird to me, because I could never imagine treating my sister like that. I guess she wasn’t awful but compared to the other characters she really sucked. And… Levi. Oh Levi. This boy… he was awesome. So kind and gentle and loving. And he was the most patient person ever. Gosh, honestly I’m not sure that anyone would ever be as patient as Levi. He was perfect.<br /><br />So obviously the characters were outstanding, now that I’ve finished gushing about them, so that brings me to another point: Rainbow Rowell’s writing. It’s something else. The way she can alone, construct a character but aside from that have me feeling as if I am so IN this book that I cannot put it down. The wit, the emotion, even Cath’s fan fiction had me completely engrossed. I can totally see why her books are so popular now because her writing is phenomenal.<br /><br />One of the things I was most nervous about in Fangirl was the fan fiction portion. I have tried to read fan fiction, both years ago and recently, and just never found the appeal. It wasn’t anything specific with the stories, it just wasn’t my thing. When I learned that Fangirl’s main plot point was surrounding fan fiction, it was what ticked the big “No” box in my mind. Now, I have to admit, when I first started reading I wasn’t into it. I didn’t think it would be necessary to read, and thought it mimicked Harry Potter too much. And then something clicked with me, and I couldn’t wait for the portions where Cath read her fanfic to Levi. It really plays a large part in the novel, and an enjoyable one at that.<br /><br />The romance and love story is also fantastic. While that aspect is definitely the main point of the novel, there was so many other elements that went into Fangirl. Family, relationships, navigating through university, anxiety… it’s really much more that I expected and really more than I think anyone would expect based on the synopsis.<br /><br />Obviously, I only rated Fangirl 4 stars so there were a few things that didn’t totally click with me so I will stop raving for a second. The pacing did start to get a bit slow. I loved the story at first, and I loved Cath’s journey but it did start to get a bit tired and I just wanted it to hurry up and continue with Levi. It didn’t really impact my feelings for the book much, but did become a bitrepetitive for a while. The only other “problem” I had with the book was the ENDING. Clearly I won’t spoil it for anyone but I just wanted more. I thought with the impact that the book had on me overall that the ending left me feeling a bit underwhelmed. It wasn’t bad, and some people probably enjoyed it a lot but it wasn’t totally there for me.<br /><br />Despite those two things, this is one of my favorite books this year. The “negative” things I had to say don’t even stack up against the amazingness of this book. If you are doubting that you would enjoy it, I would suggest giving it a try. The hype definitely did not ruin this one for me!
B00AYPXG5W|4.0|Well handled and realistic account of a terrifying event.  I thought the acting and direction was spot on and would recommend this movie to all UFO buffs.
1568363931|5.0|Okay so this isn't exactly a pirate's treasure (what were YOU thinking???) but it is a great starter cookbook to help you make some delicious and healthy lunches.<br /><br />I'm waiting for cookbook number two!
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|I found that the story line, acting, and most of the visual effects of this movie to be highly over budget with a horrible result. There wasn't a story line or plot to this movie, it just kind of bounced where ever it really wanted to. The acting was HORRIBLE, these actors and actresses should be fired and fined for the horrible display of professionalism they showed on screen. The visual effects, although at times stunning, were all the movie relied. Therefore I have to say that the effects were lacking and repeated over and over again. How many times do they want us to watch of one of the big robots get launched? How about watching yet another big lizard for 2 hours. This movie should have been a TV special and that's about it.<br /><br />The only reason this movie got a 2 star rating was because it made me want to watch Transformers.
B007QUUJMG|3.0|I kept waiting for 'something' to happen. The book is okay but left me with a meandering sense of emptiness - perhaps what the author intended but certainly not a notion that will have me giving a high recommendation.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really am enjoying it, really passes the time.  Can get frustrating at times, trust me; but a cool game. :-)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so cool because every were I go I can play in it. so of you get this game you sour love it solo much.  :D &hearts;&hearts;&hearts;
B002RI9S2Y|3.0|Was not a bad read. Our boys loved it. a bit predictable but enjoyable. whole family looking forward to the next one.
B004SDEP38|1.0|I couldn't install it on my cellphone, maybe you can, I had to get my money back and too much hassle.
B001QVFDA4|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!  I ordered it as it has some of my favorite actors in it.  Tom Hardy, Gerard Butler, and so many more!  It hooks you from the start and keeps you enthralled all the way to the end!  What a great ride!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It was wonderful to re visit old friends from a time to kill, brilliant writing, great plot, fleshed out characters.
B002XTXG1G|5.0|Tom Hardy was absolutely brilliant in this role!  I have read up on the &#34;real&#34; Charlie Bronson....sad.  Thank you Amazon for recommending this one when I was looking for Tom Hardy movies.  Might have missed out....that would have been tragic!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love mind games and this app doesn't disappoint! I am already sure I will be sad to complete the game but can't seem to put it down!
B005P06AAO|4.0|From the 3 seasons, this one is the best.<br />Fresh and funny. We have of course most of the sterotype teens, but with a good balance.<br />Totally Awkward!
B008EZVNO0|5.0|I really enjoy Van Morrison's music and this CD, like all his others, did not disappoint!  I have listened to it over and over again!!
1423113497|4.0|I really like how the Greek Mythology is addapted into the new world in this series.<br />The writing is fluid and fun, even though sometimes the 1st person narrative it's a little tiring it makes up in lots of adventures and ingenious chapters.
B00DJ80VLS|2.0|Gee, thanks for the DVD which does nothing.  It only plays the exact music from the CD but only in 5.1 audio (or whatever the hell that means).  I'm not a sound engineer, I don't know what the hell 5.1 audio is, nor do I care.  Basically I have a CD and a DVD that prentends to be a CD.  WHAT'S THE POINT OF THAT?  I feel f***ed over. lol.  BTW this DT album is not as good and \\"Dramatic Turn of Events\\" (and that wasn't my favorite DT album either).  I won't give 'one' star because I do like the album, just not as much as expected.
B00DJ80VLS|4.0|As usual a great effort from the band. I'm kinda enjoying the addition of Mangini and his contribution to the sound and writing.  It seems as though Jordan is using a more diverse selection of keyboard patches this time around and is spreading his musical wings a bit more on this release.  The other members great as always.  I think the writing could have been more musically diverse in the area of composition this time around.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Great game but crashes frequently after leaving the app. An exit out of app button might solve this. I still enjoy the game.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|Paul McCartney's newest album &#34;New,&#34; is a great listen.  After I heard it the first time, I found myself with one of the tunes in my head.  Having only heard it once, I couldn't quite place it.  When I realized what it was, I went and played the CD again...and then again.  I have been a Beatles/Wings/McCartney fan since 1964, and I have to say this is one of Sir Paul's best.
B009LDD1X0|4.0|I watch these shows over and over. Whenever I need to laugh and laugh to something not so overly sexualized this is my show. My ten year old daughter loves it also.
B007EC27QM|5.0|This is a very good calculator. I am very bad with numbers and since I always have my Kindle with me I always have the calculator. I use it everyday. I like the fact that the numbers are large so I can see them better than on my phone or computer. Thank you, Mary
0525478817|5.0|My son loved it!  Didnt put it down till he was done! Was happy to have him spend some time off the computer
B00821PCJS|5.0|Great show! If you love science fiction and action this is the show to watch. I have enjoyed every episode.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I kept watching for this game to come out for kindle. so much bigger play area than my phone. still very addictive. challenging and fun.
B00DL2W7Q4|5.0|Critics have taken the opportunity of Gladwell's new book to attack the increasingly popular style of 'creative non-fiction' of which he's been the master - rather than being as rigorous as a university textbook, Gladwell makes use of stories and anecdotes to promote his insight.<br />As with any creative non-fiction, the semi-intelligent reader knows they're not reading a social science essay - which often tries hopelessly to emulate the field of physics, making use of unsimplifying equations and sheer boredom to disguise the subjectivity of their subject matters - when reading a Gladwell story, the reader knows that what they are reading is a case, and will need to be convinced with logic rather than impressive references and credentials.<br />And this book is perhaps Gladwell's best piece of thinking material to date. Compared to previous books, the points are fewer, the stories are longer, and finally leave a sharper dent on your own view - you will not think of a David or Goliath in quite the same way again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is great.  It's relaxing and addictive!!  I've been waiting for it to come to Kindle!  I love playing on the larger screen.
B00CO8D3G4|2.0|I'm a huge fan of the blog, but this ultimately comes across as a self-help book - as the pages turned it grew lighter on logic, and the format of a rant-followed-by-positive-perspective was becoming repetitive and groundless, to the point I started to feel like Altucher was writing to himself - to convince himself of his own conclusions - and I the bored psychiatrist checking the clock.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Such a good show, drama, romance, trajedy, and a twist of scandal. This show grabs your attenion and doesnt let go. I definitely recomend watching it from start to finish! But watch out, you might not be able to stop!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I think candy crush saga is a great matching and challenging game that gets your mind thinking. If you haven't gotten this game yet you should because it's really fun!
B00B7G3Y4U|2.0|While the first film was an outstanding horror flick that quickly ended as the \\"suits\\" got a hold of the franchise and started cranking out sequels.  There will be some minor spoilers ahead, so you've been warned.<br /><br />The first film excelled at building up tension and hitting you with something unexpected.  This time, we have the absurd idea of the Kinect Cam watching the living room at all times.  This is the premise for \\"seeing\\" the activity, motion in the IR dots.  We do get some webcam footage from a laptop, because of course everyone walks around all the time carrying their laptop with the webcam on.<br /><br />If this wasn't absurd enough, the plot revolves around the child kidnapped in PA2 who shows up next door with her \\"mother\\" who then goes missing, so of course the police decided \\"we'll just let the neighbors watch the kid\\".  Even with a movie about the paranormal, this simple bypass of Child Protective Services is a glaring plot sore which is even more unbelievable than the supernatural in the film.  The rest of the movie goes as expected, no twists to throw the audience off.  The ending is a horror cliche as our heroine does something that no one in their right mind would do given the same circumstances.<br /><br />While the 2nd film essentially set up how the events of the first film happened and the 3rd was a prequel (with plot holes), this 4th installment adds nothing to the franchise as a whole.  I will say our young blonde protagonist does her acting well, considering the thin plot she has to work with.  If it comes in a Paranormal Activity collection pack then watch it once then forget about it, but don't pay for this individually.
B000021Y77|1.0|I had heard of this movie and wanted to see it. I am so glad I did not pay too much for it. The movie was terrible. I love Franka Potente but this movie is not good. It had a good concept but it just dragged on and on. You watch one scene over and over and over.<br />I donated this movie to goodwill.
B00631VJIC|5.0|this cd is for the times you just want to sit back and relax and enjoy some really great music
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|I liked this movie so much I had to order another one. The first disc was damaged so I ordered another. I can't wait for Prometheus 2. I love the alien movies so these are an added bonus.
B009AY04A8|4.0|If you like hidden object games then this is the game for you kept me entertained for hours.<br />The items are not to easy to find so it keeps you entertained.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|Another holocaust movie but well worth watching. Kate Winslet is amazing in this movie. I highly recommend getting you will not be disappointed.
076115728X|5.0|I used this book as a motivator for my elementary students. The results have been amazing!!!! I could not have ever dreamed of the many way students &#34;created&#34; with just a page from an old art supply catalog. They seem to have released all pre-conceived notions of what is &#34;art&#34;. YAY!!!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game was really cool. But it can be really hard at times, but that makes it really fun,  you know what i mean.
B00622B3MY|5.0|got this for a 2 year old....as he recognized it on screen...he seemed to enjoy it and hung onto almost all of the movie....I am guessing we will watch it many times when he visits...

B003HARV3Y|5.0|Great Book
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was an easy read! It was suspenseful but more thought provoking than anything! It makes you really think about your actions and consequences.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|For instance, after level 35 you have to do 1 of 3 things to go further--go to Facebook and beg for help, pay money, or do 3 \\"quests,\\" which are separated by 24 hours each time. Additionally, \\"lives\\" are capped at five (at least up to level 35. I can't progress; see above), and they take 30 minutes each to regenerate. I've seen better M3 games. Most disappointing.
B00D8CSVLW|5.0|Sycamore Row is definitely a Grisham novel written in his unique style which blends legal matters, light humor, and a good mystery. The book brings back Jack Brigance (the lawyer who defended Carl Lee Hailey in the book A Time to Kill).<br /><br />The story revolves around a very wealthy man named Seth Hubbard who is dying of lung cancer. One Saturday afternoon in Clanton, Mississippi, his body is found hanging from a Sycamore Tree. He had hanged himself. The following Monday, lawyer Jack Brigance receives a letter from Seth Hubbard containing a two-page handwritten will Seth had written before he hanged himself.<br /><br />In the will, Seth leaves 90% of his fortune to a his black housekeeper, Lettie Lang and leaves out all of his children and grandchildren. To make things more complicated, there is an earlier will drafted by a firm of lawyers. As expected, Seth's children are far from amused and are planning to fight the handwritten will at all costs.<br /><br />Sycamore Row is a very good read. If you enjoy reading Grisham's books, you will love this one.
B00EDLP6O2|4.0|This is my son Maleek telling me what he like's about it. Because he gets to play boxing on his tablet. It is a really fun game to play after he's done with his work.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Allegiant continues where Insurgent leaves off. Evelyn, Tobias mother and leader of the factionless is now in charge. Tris has been imprisoned awaiting a hearing. Evelyn insists that all factions must be destroyed and everyone should be free. However, not everyone is happy about the abolition of factions and a group of people have come together to topple Evelyn's hold on the city.<br /><br />Tris and Tobias, along with their friends, manage to escape the city and go beyond it's borders. They meet the people who have been conducting the experiments on cities like theirs. They learn that the Divergent are considered genetically pure while the rest are considered genetically damaged. Tobias learns he may not be what he had always considered himself to be and the knowledge threatens to tear his relationship with Tris apart.<br /><br />Veronica Roth writes a very exciting sequel in Allegiant. The story is, for me, more exciting than its predecessors. I could not put it down until I finished it. And the ending is something that I never saw coming.
0375507256|2.0|Having also written a book including past lives and their impact on present ones, I looked forward to reading Cloud Atlas. The writing is clever, and the six stories were each interesting in their own way. Although many of the characters find themselves living different realities together in different time periods, I found it disappointing that they did not seem to learn from the past, but seemed to simply repeat the same tragic circumstances. I found the post-apocalyptic Hawaii in the sci-fi futuristic section to be exceptionally dismal and dreary. Give me a little hope for the future, please, Mr. Mitchell.<br />Namaste!<br />Becca Chopra, author of Chakra Secrets
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad that this is available on kindle fire now.  It's long overdue! The only bad thing I have to say is now I am way beyond addicted to my kindle and the game and I can't get anything else done.  Oh well!!! ;+D
B00G32QIEG|3.0|Not a horrible movie, but I expected it to be quite a bit funnier. I didn't care for Jeff Bridges' performance and I think giving James Hong more screen time, for absurd action scenes, could have helped a bit.
B00E8JTSVG|5.0|I was given a copy of this book by the author in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book more than the first one, and I still love the world and culture the author has created with these stories.<br /><br />We carry on from book 1 where grey wolf is lost, and something is not quite right with white bear.  I was so glad to find out what was going on with white bear as I was worried at the end of the first book that he might have been doing something evil.<br /><br />I really enjoyed how the chapters were done from different characters POV.  I think this is one of the main reasons I enjoyed this book more than the first.  I liked all the characters in the first book and with this one we were able to get to know each of them more personally and I connected more with all of them.<br /><br />With this book there seemed to be a lot more happening which I really liked, and I especially enjoyed the story line from the first part of the book.  I thought it was sad but beautiful and how the author describes their story was brilliant and I was so happy with the outcome.<br /><br />I thought Oria and grey wolf's romance was even better in this book, they seemed to have more of a relationship and their love for each other just seemed to be more obvious, and even though there was definitely more interaction between the two, their love still remained to be sweet and innocent and just beautiful really.<br /><br />We were also introduced to quite a few more new characters, and two of my favourites were fire cloud and Sapata.<br /><br />Now I'm just really hoping that grey wolf and Oria finally find their happily ever after, along with all the others, because they defiantly deserve to after everything they have been through.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to readers of the YA genre and I will be reading the 3rd book with fingers crossed, hoping that everything works out happily.<br /><br />5-stars<br />Reviewed by Bethany
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It is definitely a cute game. While it is made for their fanbase, I feel that those unfamilar with the game will still find it enjoyable.
B00ARHAAZ6|2.0|I REALLY liked the concept and the first few sample chapters were great; so much so that I bought the book on the day it came out. Unfortunately it kinda just fell apart after the intro. The main character is terrible and his relationship with the female heroine felt forced, flat and artificial. Over all, Steelheart started off strong but just went down hill from there. It felt like someone else wrote the middle section of this book. I say this with a heavy heart, as Brandon Sanderson is one of my absolute favorite authors, but Steelheart is probably Sanderson's worst work. The end was OK I guess but definitely did not make up for the awful dialog and personality traits of David, the main character. If you are a Sanderson fan I'd recommenced you skip this one and go read the Rithmatist instead. In fact this is the ONLY work Sanderson has written I would not recommend to a friend. Two stars as I just didn't have the heart to give a Sanderson book one and the intro was pretty strong :(
B00FX8FQ76|5.0|My first time listening to an entire Katy Perry album and not disappointed at all! This is such an energetic and emotional album. I highly recommend this album especially a must have for Katy Perry fans!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Nothing surprising just good fun. Program works as promised. Lots of possibilities and final tally to show how you're doing compared to the general population.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Vivid description of the &#34;Long Walk&#34;  Enough of those inevitably leads to death or PTSD.  The author wove the nightmare after combat int the story of combat
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I thought the book was an easy read...wonderfully written...and a great story.  You can't miss with this one!<br />I recommend it for any book club read.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Beautiful, heart warming book! I wasn't expecting to love it so much, but it is most definitely in my Top 3 favorite books list! read it!
006202406X|1.0|*Spoilers*<br />This book had so much potential, and I just cannot get over the fact that Roth would kill off Tris.  Four and Tris were supposed to be together and save their home, and even from a writers point of view I see no reason for Tris to die.  To show her love?  Her selflessness?  There were other ways to do that.  Killing wasn't one of them.  It ruined the whole book, and I really don't think I'll ever be able to read this series again.
0385537131|5.0|I have all of the books that he has written for adults.  He is one of my favorite authors and I know that I will enjoy his suspenseful writing.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Three books to see the heroine of the series die. Very disappointed, feel like I wasted my time reading this third book. Tris should have been able to see this new world she helped create. Does not make sense to even invest in seeing the movie, to love such a strong character to only see her die in the end.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|So good. I was with this book so much more than I had been throughout the second installment. I liked the swap between points of view, and the movement. Roth handled so many different ideas and characters really nicely. I was definitely disappointed by the way that it ended, but not in her writing itself; I thought it was a brave move, and thought she did Tris and Tobias justice. My inner romantic just wish things had ended differently.
B005V2S7FW|3.0|I work out of my home running a small business. I used it everyday on my PCs on average 20 times per day. It saves me a lot of time. However, when I try to log on Amazon, eBay, my two number ONE sites, I have to enter it manually. I have over 200 sites with maxed out passwords. Impossible to remember. I have Dolphin installed and it works  better than the Chrome that Google tries to shove down my throat.<br /><br />LastPass doesn't work very well, if at all, on Amazon. One annoyance has to do with trying to play a game and they want me to buy some level to get rid of the ads. I cannot get it to log on to Amazon EVER. Copy, Paste, log into Amazon first, log into Amazon through the vault, I cannot get around it, thus, I have to put up with non-stop ads in FreeForm. Playing a game at 10x10, with non-stop incessant ads makes it very hard to focus.<br /><br />I was really hoping LastPass would save me, but it couldn't. On the other hand, I have over 200 very strong passwords that it saves me a lot of time on.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Works perfectly. Other one I originally had finally worn out. This came quick and in time. Would definitely recommend to anyone who had originally kindle
B0043X1FOK|5.0|Fast delivery not much to say I guess.  Well done thank you for it and awesome work I enjoy the movie its a classic one the I wanted to add to my collection excellent work for advertising
B000VX6YCO|5.0|My Hubby loves these shoes. Great prices. Nice fit. Very comfortable. Best purchased made in a long time. Glad we purchased them.
B002MUAJ2A|4.0|Succinct and direct advice targeted at small businesses, but can be applied to all manner of situations. Some of it I agreed with, some of it challenged my way of thinking. I will definitely revisit the many sections I highlighted to mill over in my brain.
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|While the story line and plot was interesting, it became repetitive a while later. The final meeting with the patient was anticlimatic.
0824835921|5.0|This book has changed my outlook on the way I learn Kanji. Heisig's approach on tackling the 2000+ Chinese characters is very manageable. He breaks them down from the most basic character (a horizontal line) to the most complex one. RTK employs a form of mnemonic technique that involves creating a story revolving each individual character's elements ( or primitives as what Heisig calls them). These elements/primitives will build up one another as you progress through the book making it difficult to come up with a story that revolves around these elements. RTK is best used in conjunction with an SRS software (like Anki, or Supermemo, etc and Reviewing the Kanji website.  These tools I mentioned will make your life much easier. The only two drawbacks about this book are: some Kanji are not used anymore according to Japanese education ministry standards and it doesn't teach you the readings of each individual characters. This book is not for the faint-hearted. There are three things you'll need to help you succeed on finishing this book: motivation, willpower, and comitment. So far, I got down 1800 characters as of this day. Buy it! You won't disappoint!
B008M721MS|2.0|I am using this app on my new Kindle Fire HDX and I am not satisfied with its quality. For a few seconds immediately after the start of a video call there is thick green stinge on both the caller 's and the callee's videos. It goes away shortly after but is very annoying. The worst thing is, the app cannot do the logout properly. When I try to sign out, it crashes and when I reopen the app I am still logged in. The only way my wife could login is to uninstall the app and reinstall it! What a nuisance!
B008AIGWVA|1.0|chose rating because the dog just sits there reading his newspaper, instructions on how to use are not clear at all
B00EKQ3YZI|4.0|This fan cannot boast of the knowledge nor the workings of commercial music nor all the industry terms used in the media for it, I can only tell you how a record makes me feel and why. Love to Love You Donna is for this writer an elixir that takes away the pains of age and freshens the memory of a time where everything was  a &#34;Trip to Nowhere&#34; and there was never a &#34;Last Dance.&#34; I found this tribute to our beloved Donna to be fresh, exciting and mind blowing. I only did not choose 5 stars to rate it because some of the tracks lose me in their sheer innovative treatment of the material and left me intimidated by the use of the technology. My favorite tracks are: Love to Love you Baby (magnficient!); Love is in Control (non stop energy!) and Last Dance (simply lovely). Thank you, Verve Music Group and the amazing remix artists who created this work. I can tell you that this Disco Dinosaur is no longer extinct and I truly feel that your work will introduce The First Lady of Love to a whole new generation of eager listeners and dancers. &#34;Dance your heart away!&#34;
1848507836|5.0|This book has been my constant companion for several weeks now it is such a comfort to me. I appreciate Anita's honesty is sharing her wonderful experiences with us. I have read many spiritual books and this is by far my favorite!
159463176X|3.0|The author asked a lot of me to follow the connections between characters and years. His payback to the reader for such an investment was disappointing. Well written, but I felt like I was held hostage at the mercy of the author's slightly too-sophisticated imagination.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Looks like a real calculator and is easy to use. The numbers are big enough for older people and little ones. Would highly recommend
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Feedly is perfect for organizing all of your rss feeds. I use it to catch up on all of my gaming and world news.
B002DJZJT8|5.0|Very very good movie.. I saw it when it first came out and I still love it.. Very good choice..!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a great game to play to unwind.  I wish I could get more Bingos so I could play longer!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Didn't think I would like this game. But I do. It's  very addictive.  Tell your friends they have to try it. Glad its finally available.
B00EKQ3YZI|1.0|I love Donna's music and even saw her in concert in the 80's.  The remixes detracted from the music, sometimes the music drowned out her voice, and familiar songs were not recognizable at first.  I'll stick with the originals.
B000JQUHLM|4.0|this is one of the clássics I never had a chance to read or have  read to me in my childhood, And am looking forward to do so now that I am retired and have time on my hands. I am most grateful thatAmazon is bringing all these wonderful. Clásica to those of us who still want to make up for opportunities we missed
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|Every spin of this cd gets better and better.  I had a two and a half hour drive today, and I listed to this album the entire time I was in the car.  Each song is just the way you expect Alter Bridge to sound: loud, passionate, melodic, rocking.  This album is their strongest showing, in my opinion.  It was worth the wait!
B008QPCCQQ|4.0|I am slowly building up a collection of books from my childhood  days to read them all again. Once i have read them I would lime to give a summarised review which I can share with other readers
B008K9SG9K|4.0|I'd give this 3 and a half if I had the option.  Since the songs on the album that I enjoy are REALLY GOOD, I'm bumping up to a four.  This is not a band that you can define.  They are up, down, and all around in their sound and mood.  Their songs you hear on the radio are all awesome - Radioactive, It's Time, & Demons.  Also excellent in my book are Bleeding Out & Rocks.  Someone here compared a song or two to sounding like they're off The Lion King soundtrack, and I can totally see where that opinion comes from.  A couple of tracks are too far out in left field for my taste, but for the most part it's a good album.  What I most wanted to impart here is that to me, the sound quality thing that some people have poo-pooed is a non-issue for me.  I wouldn't NOT buy this album if it's the only thing holding you back.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Haven't played all the way through yet. But I am already addicted to playing this game. There's just enough challenge for a good bit of head scratching but if you take your time and sometimes back tracking (ok, and some help with the hints) you can figure it out. Just a bit of a hint, play with the objects in your inventory.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|I love that there are so many catchy songs on this album...but that I can listen to it with my 10-year-old without censoring anything!
B0055JPM6I|4.0|I am actually surprised at all the bad reviews this movie has gotten. Even in \\"This is the end\\" James Franco and the others poke fun at it. I, myself, thought it was hilarious. You just can't take it seriously. If you want a good laugh, this is your movie.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Bought this movie for my 9 year old daughter.  She absolutely loved the movie.  The movie was a great value!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|My sister has to wake up at 5:45 for school. The alarm clock helps her to wake up early. You should get this.
B008Y7J91M|5.0|North and South is full of drama, love and passion.  Superb acting through believable character portrayals transcends the viewers into another time and place.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Fun but a little short. Glad it was free<br />Not much of a challenge either. I will play through again.
B004EF65QA|5.0|Loved the superb acting and brilliant character portrayals.  I felt like I had been transported to another time and place into the midst of the heroine's secrets and passions.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game! My new favorite game to play. Easy to use and fun to play. Very, very addictive though!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|As usual u can't put the book down it took him 10 years to write about Jake again and he did it perfectly!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game can't put it down I play all the time and it is a great way to pass the time
B00AZL3PBK|2.0|I am playing this on a kindle fire, and I like it, but the on screen controls are really buggy. They will suddenly just freeze often causing you to lose the level, which is frustrating.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|A very good read. I'm waiting for the next one! I hope it's coming soon! I have thoroughly enjoyed all of your books.
B005HSL626|5.0|Corny titles aside, my experience with this game has been nothing but enjoyable! I haven't come across any glitches, it was quick to download, and tons of fun! I dare to say I'm obsessed with slicing fruit and unlocking the backgrounds and blades. Even my six year old brother loves playing it; and how can you beat free? Definitely worth grabbing!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is my first time playing . Got my mom hook to.Great game just that when ever u shut it down it pop up king then u play other than that its great so five stars.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham has told a great story. The writing as presented was very spell bounding.<br />May the final settlement be a reward for those who deserve it.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I hate zombies.  Like anything that Hollywood thinks is a easy money maker, they beat it to death with tripe, gore, and cheesy acting/story/writing where you thank the powers that the zombie is eating the retard on the screen who pollutes the gene pool with their stupidity (and secretly wish the same fate on the writers/producers for the tripe they're putting on screen).  I hate the tropes and romanticized glee that its ok to hunt/destroy zombies because its guilt free mayhem, and I hate how glossed over the psychology of the survivors becomes.  In short, I hate how zombies are typically handled in movies or tv because the writers crank out insulting and unimaginative garbage.<br /><br />I give this show 5 stars and watch every season as it comes out and revisit previous seasons upon occasion.  This is zombie horror and drama, this takes all the romantic/air headed tripe out of the genre and puts fantastic story, acting, drama, direction, and effects in front of you to make you pray this sort of thing never happens.
B00DHRLK84|4.0|The film is a fairly good zombie/action title with good acting performances and an abundance of special effects. I bought if for the 3D and in that regard it is a very good movie. 3D is mostly used to provide a sense of depth and scale and it does this wonderfully. I played this on a projector an a screen about 10 ft wide and some of the rooftop scenes had me grabbing the couch arms because if felt so real.
B002ZG997C|4.0|this is an eerie end time film...  Denzel Washington once again fits his role and brings home a sobering truth about humanity....
B005LAII08|4.0|Really, why do these companies force you to buy multiple versions of one stinking movie. I mean seriously, it's just a movie. I really just wanted the 3D version but I had to buy this collection instead. Even the box feels heavy. This is an area where I think Amazon could/should exercise some of it's clout and force these studios to offer just the 3D blu-ray disc at a reasonable price. If you haven't seen Brave, you should. It's a good movie and the 3D is really the icing on the cake.
B00008G8M4|5.0|Well...here we have an interesting take on alien invasion and the way to mess up the other guys computer. I did enjoy the story, the way 'Earthlings' faced off the bad 'Aliens.' It is just a something to do on a week-end type film.
B00E3IZIM0|4.0|This is an over the top comic book style action movie that doesn't pretend to be anything but that. If you're a fan of del Toro, you'll like this movie. If you want a big, loud popcorn movie to show off a 3D tv or projector you'll like it too. The 3D is well used and really draws you in. There is a scene in particular where a child is being chased where because of the 3d the fear is palpable.
B00003CXB2|5.0|this is one of the CLASSICS in film. The sweeping deserts, the Arab persona. The internal strife Lawrence faced as a British officer, and an Arab brother... the music. This is one fine film.
B008MVPCNE|4.0|Very light but durable crocs that like most crocs are larger than the size indicator actually says. The material is very light and the strap holds the shoes in place so they don't slip and slide on your feet. I really do wish Croc would fix their sizing issues though.
B0013FFMOK|4.0|Will Smith is growing up. His film presence is becoming more real. Some of the violence is a little beyond what children should see...
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this book! It was amazing! Can't wait for the movie!! If you haven't read it you need too! A must read!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome fun I can not stop playing this. Kids can not stop playing this. I have to tight for my turn. :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|CANDY CRUSH IS A BLAST..I AM ADDICTED..I LIKE HAVING TO STRATEGIZE MY NEXT MOVE..I WOULD AND HAVE RECOMMENDED THIS GAME..
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I absolutely devoured this book, and cannot wait for the next offering from Anthony Ryan.  This book is an excellent work of modern fantasy.  If you area fan of Scott Lynch or Brent Weeks, definitely give this book a spot on your to read list.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This app is so much fun! When you start playing you never want to stop. The only bad thing is that you have to wait for more lives. Other than that,you should really get Candy Crush.
0380807343|5.0|Like many, I watched the brilliant stop-motion filmic adaptation of [[ASIN:B002BWCJOA Coraline]] before reading Neil Gaiman's original story, and as such, it was interesting to see the deviations between the book and film. Much like [[ASIN:0061689246 Stardust]], another Gaiman book that was given the big-screen treatment, Coraline is a truly wonderful example of a story of such imaginative potency that any filmic adaptation only enhances and enriches it.<br /><br />Gaiman is consistently good at two things: drawing upon ancient folklore in which to shape his tales, and remembering what it was like to be a child. So many of his books (most recently [[ASIN:0062255657 The Ocean at the End of the Lane]]) have taken the structure and elements of fairytales and filtered them through a child protagonist's point of view, resulting in stories that tap into our most primal fear and anxieties: darkness, isolation, purgatory and - most pertinently for young readers - the idea that our loving and protective parents aren't really that loving and protective at all.<br /><br />Coraline Jones is a little girl of an indeterminate age (I would have placed her at about ten, but at other times she seems much younger) who has moved with her parents into a house so large that the owners let out various portions of it as flats. Coraline has an eclectic collection of neighbours, but no friends and inattentive parents. It is on one particularly rainy (and boring) day that she discovers a door leading into another section of the house. Much like [[ASIN:0486408787 Alice Through the Looking-Glass]], Coraline finds herself in a house that reflects her own - except here the food is delicious, the toys are delightful, and her parents focus all their attention solely on her. It's every child's dream. But strangely enough, this Other Mother has buttons for eyes - and tells Coraline that she only can stay in her specially-made wonderland if she undergoes the same procedure.<br /><br />The stakes are raised when Coraline returns to her own world only to find that her parents have disappeared. Now it's up to her to rescue them and the Other Mother's previous victims. Armed with a stone with a hole bored through it and a talking cat as her only companion, Coraline challenges the Other Mother to a game - her life for the freedom of her parents and the souls of the lost children. The Other Mother accepts, and the game is on...<br /><br />In many ways \\"Coraline\\" isn't an original tale. It draws upon countless fairytales in order to shape its content: a threefold trial, missing parents, an evil \\"stepmother\\", a mirror-world, a talking cat, a series of riddles and a heroine that must rely on cunning and bravery if she's to overcome the challenges she faces. But Gaiman's light prose and ability to tap into the nature of childhood makes this a story that simultaneously feels new and deeply familiar - as all the very best stories are.<br /><br />If you're like me and you watched the film first, you'll find that both versions of the story complement each other wonderfully. Henry Selick's stop-motion animation is the perfect visual medium with which to tell this story, and elements though some elements such as Coraline's friend Wybie were added to the film, there are other treats to be found in the story - such as an extended confrontation between Coraline and her Other Father in the basement - that didn't make it onto the big screen.<br /><br />Whether it's suitable for very young children is a call that each parent will have to make, taking into consideration that each child has their own threshold for scary tales. Suffice to say that this is a very dark and creepy book. Gaiman's imagery and ideas can be disturbing, right down to the glistening dark buttons that all the living creatures of the Other House have for eyes (and apparently fear of buttons is actually a real phobia known as koumpounophobia - I doubt any sufferers will enjoy this book). Coraline's story is dangerous and suspenseful, and any parents looking for a light bedtime read might want to think twice before cracking upon this book. Even the illustrations by Dave McKean are macabre in nature, with angular bodies and distorted faces and shadows that grow out from the walls.<br /><br />That said, being scared is not necessarily a bad thing. As the preface (a quote from G.K. Chesterton) states: \\"fairytales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.\\" Being frightened and learning to face those fears is a process we all have to go through, and is often best prepared for by reading stories that prove that evils of all kind can be defeated with resilience and fortitude.

B003K1EYM6|1.0|I purchased this iPad camera connection kit.  I couldn't make it work so I figured it was my fault; I was doing something wrong.  Finally a year later, I ordered another one from a different seller.  That one works perfectly and is very easy to use.  These have the same EXACT product # !  I am so sorry to have spent the money on this first one and it is now too late to return it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I could use the extra lives friends send me. can only use those if on a computer playing through facebook. all I have is my phone and kindle
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I'll keep this short, because others have already shared most of my thoughts.  Obviously an author can choose to end a book however he/she chooses.  But as another review said, you can drag readers through a lot, as long as there's a payoff at the end.  Allegiant missed the boat here.  After several hundred pages of disappointing plot points and disheartening character turns, coupled with the one bright spot of Tris and Four developing and maturing their relationship, learning to trust and understand one another... that was a really poor way to reward readers who waited a year for this book.
B006LQQ1GE|4.0|Most of the album is good, a couple of less appealing tunes.  Save Me, Somebody I Used to Know, We're Watching you. . . great lyrics and vocals.  State of the Art requires the video on YouTube to understand.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am an older woman and I love to play this game. It has been so much fun to train and groom my horse. One of the best parts is trying to win the free horse. In the game.  Love it's Anyone can play at any age and they will love it too.

B002ZRPQ5K|4.0|I've enjoyed all of Keane's full length albums, but I hesitated to buy this EP because of all the low reviews. I downloaded it anyway and am glad I did. This EP is a handful of recordings they made around the world in between concert dates of their Perfect Symmetry world  tour. It was not meant to rival the quality of full length albums that are labored over for months in a recording studio. It was designed to give the true Keane fans, those who want to hear everything the band is up to, a few morsels to tide them over until their next meal--Strangland--which is great, by the way. The songs on Night Trane don't seem to fit the sound or theme of the other Keane albums. I guess that's why it is just an EP. It seems Keane was sort of going for a retro-70s, synthesizer driven feel sort of reminding me of a mix of KC and the Sunshine Band, a hint of U2, and, well, a little too much modern hip-hop for my personal taste. I'm not a huge fan of rap music and I think the naysayers that gave this album one star agree. So let's break the songs down a little.<br />\\"House Lights\\", the first track, is just noise, perhaps to give auditory feel of house lights coming on or something. Again, it was just noise so I'm not sure why they felt compelled to include it.<br />\\"Back in Time\\" sort of summarizes the feel of this album, sort of retro. This is a good song that reminds me of the type of thing they must have written when they were teenagers just starting out. For all I know, that's exactly what the song is. Anyway, I kind of like it.<br />\\"Stop for a Minute\\" is the stand out song I like the best. I could have done without the rapping, but I think K'naan the Somali/Canadian did a fine job performing his craft. The song really works well. My daughter loves it. Very catchy.<br />\\"Clear Skies\\" has an interesting rhythm and features a guitar as lead instrument rather than the typical piano. I rather enjoy this song.<br />\\"Ishin Denshin\\" This song is probably the reason for all the poorreviews. It's got a catchy chorus, but the verse is rapped by a female Japanese rapper named Tigarah. Also, it's rapped in what I assume to be the Japanese language. I can't listen to this one. It's pretty bad. I always skip to the next song.<br />\\"Your Love\\" is another synthesizer retro song that harkens back to the 80s. It's a good song though.<br />\\"Looking Back\\" starts out with what sounds liked brass section sampled synthesizers with an opening hook that sounds like the theme to the 70s movie Rocky. K'naan raps in this one too and even mentioned Rocky. It's a good song. The title even suggests the retro \\"Looking Back\\" feel of the song.<br />\\"My Shadow\\" is a great song.  It's more of the traditional Keane we are used to hearing. This song alone is worth the cost of the download.<br />The last song is just a remix of \\"Looking Back\\" with vocal special effects. I skip over this one too. Not sure why they had to add this one but it is what it is I guess.<br />So over all, aside from three skip worthy songs, this was a great EP. Maybe I like it more than some people because I am 45-years old, an oldster compared to most Keane fans. The retro feel of the EP brings me back to my youth. Thanks for that, Keane. It's good to be \\"Looking Back\\" every once and a while.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|hello,<br />  for star trek fans, this blu ray is a step in the right direction.  early viewers of star trek the original series had lots of questions about some of the main characters.  this blu ray cleans up some of those mysteries.  the action is outstanding and somewhat believable, but after all, it is a sci fi movie.  the characters pick up where the other &#34;new&#34; star trek movie left off.  the chemistry is fantastic.  these characters are young enough to continue on for many more features to come.  thanks for clearing up some of the mysteries and character connections from the earlier series that left most of us just hanging and questioning.  this movie rocks and hopefully there will be more to come.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Great Movie, good 3d! Arrived on time and as described, Will purchase again! A+ Item for a great price. Thank you for a good deal!
B00FG1Q5J8|5.0|The game is lots of fun and contains humor to match the pixel graphics.  There are areas where the game is incomplete but they do not distract from the play and hopefully the developer is serious about adding that content because it would make a great game even better.<br /><br />I haven't been able to put this app down since I bought it and I really like that there isn't any in game purchasing required.
B000S1M9LY|2.0|Way too long, complicated and over my head!  Some parts were entertaining, other parts were just too complex to follow.  I'm quitting after 10 percent read!  Life is too short to continue with this book!
B000286SCO|5.0|high quality product.  Only complaint was the extremely long time it took for receipt of item.  Ordered for my husband (a drummer) who lives in China for work, and did not received before his return.  I will enjoy it but would have been nice to receive in time for him to take with him.

B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I never was a zombie kind-of-a-guy.  My buddy recommends Walking Dead and I'm like what, who cares about zombies.  But after 2 episodes of season 1. I was hooked!  The writing, storylines, is all captivating.  And the gory blood and guts of heads being smashed but you start like it.  Highly recommend
B003XU02QG|4.0|This movie surprised me - I'd never heard of it prior to stumbling up on it in a list and was pleasantly surprised by it.  The acting was solid and the effects were definitely big budget.  Worth a view.
B008532S54|5.0|This movie is hilarious. It has become one of my favorite comedies. I have seen it probably 15 times and still love it.

B00FRQ32N4|4.0|It is a really good game. The robots from then movie are spot on! The only bad thing I see so far is, I cannot connect to facebook on my kindle fire, that is why I gave it 4stars.

B008YUHQ3M|4.0|Having never read the books and only inhabiting the world created by the movies themselves I can tell you this came down to an ending that seemed too trite and unmagical for the likes of the Harry Potter I saw grow up on that screen!  Oh the effects are there (tho the 3D is strictly gimmick in these last two films and adds nothing to the overall pop of the story) and the special effects achievements throughout the series are breathtaking in their scope and execution but the story relies too heavily on having read the books.  No offense to Miss Rowling who I'm sure is a superb story teller for her books to have reached the level of worldwide acceptance that they did but the movies seemed a bit formulaic (what with Harry Potter going to Hogwarts from an untenable home each year and fretting over the mystery of the week and vacillating til his confrontation with Voldemort where he found himself rescued by Dumbledore).  My kudos on the change in atmosphere from kiddie fantasy to young adult angst in the last three movies but still when all was said and done and Lord Voldemort lay crumbling in the dust I felt let down somehow and then the scene for 19 years later comes along feeling tacked on and less than successfully visually staged (despite all the tremendous special effects achievement that came before) with Harry, Ron and Hermione looking far far less than 19 years older coming to what is meant to be a full circle having made Hogwarts safe for their own progeny.  To me the magic was deflated and they were mere Muggles again seeing their offspring off.  The books would probably have made all this seem like Grand Opera to me I'm sure as I am vehemently attacked by Potter fans whenever I express my opinion verbally but remember I am judging the films only and in particular the Grand Finale offered by this movie.  Future film historians will dissect the Potter series far more meticulously than I and I will be interested in their views on the subject as well.  Thank you for your time and patience in reading this however.for your time and patience in reading this however.

B000HF0ISC|5.0|Excellent movie!  A testament to loyalty, friendship and the truth. This is the type of movie that stays with you and really makes you think about all that is good and all that is wrong in the world.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Really disappointed! There were so many things that disappointed me with this book.<br />-It seemed almost like a completely different book, rather than the final installment of a trilogy.<br />-I think the alternating POV between Tris and Four would have been great, IF you could tell the POV without having to scroll back to the Chapter marker to see the name linked with the POV.<br />-This book lacked a sense of fluidity that her other two books contained. Characters were morphed (I think she meant to evolve them, but I didn't really get that feeling) but left unfinished in the middle of their metamorphosis.<br />-Peter and Caleb - wow, there was so much potential to really redeem these characters and I felt that it missed the mark totally.<br />-As for the ending, well this is a dystopian story. We don't expect everything to be believable, but we do expect it to be worthwhile. And unfortunately, I just don't think it was worthwhile for me.<br />All in all, it seemed splintered and unfinished...maybe even rushed. It left me with a big enough hole, that I wish that I had just let this be a two part series for me.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I mainly use it to stream Netflix, which works great!<br />Don't have to connect my laptop/tablet/phone to the tv anymore,<br />just cast it, and it will stream right through the dongle,<br />and you're free to do other stuff on your pc/tablet/phone.<br /><br />It really needs to get more apps supporting this,<br />including making it available for Windows devices as well.<br /><br />I just got a 2nd one.<br />You can play on one TV, pause it and tell to start again on TV in a different room.<br />Pretty handy!
B009WUAK2M|3.0|One time watch movie. But it is not a film that you can sit down with your family and watch.
B009DQQF7Y|4.0|As long as you are not looking to be cheered up, or hoping for pop songs with catchy hooks, You might like this. Absolutely different than anything else out there. One friend said, \\" It's not REALLY music.\\"  It's surprizing, captivating and challenging. Another freind described it as bleak but somehow triumphant.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Really gets your mind going, can become addictive if you get stuck on level s. I really enjoyed playing this game.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Who does not like this series? I was skeptical but he is such a good creator of very in-depth characters and an amazing world.
0920236162|5.0|I loved this book! It teaches girls that looks and clothes are not e erything in life. This princess is clever, brave and very confident.  When she does the most admirable and brave action and risks he life to rescue her suitor (the stereotypical Prince Charming), he criticizes her for not looking fancy or feminine.  She doesn't tolerate his insults. I LOVE the message in this book and read it to my 4 year old and have also purchased it for my nieces!
B003G4W49C|5.0|There is allot of talk about boycotting this film because of the author's political views. I think this is ridiculous. This book stands on it's own as a brilliant human story.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|IT WON'T DOWNLOAD TO MY KINDLE FIRE HD. I'VE TRIED AT LEAST 5 TIMES...FIX THIS AND I WILL BE ABLE TO USE IT AND FAIRLY RATE THE APP.

B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Dragonvale is a very great game and i love it but the only thing is that sometimes if I don't play in awhile when i come back it makes me start over, I have probably started over 3 times and i cant log into Facebook. But other than that this is a great app.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|Gripping from cover to cover.  Incorporating third person narrative gave the story a level of humanity that was chilling but at the same time warm.  Tales of mans survival during Nazi Germany's reign of terror never cease to amaze.
B00G32PQNA|1.0|I felt the movie was too much like living an everyday life.  Too much conversations.  Can't believe they are charging people to actually see it.  This might be a movie for someone who has time on their hands and is bored.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Great way to keep in touch with friends and family. Actually have family on Facebook that I met thanks to Facebook.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|I have literally been listening to this album on repeat in my car for the past 2 months. Still love every song! It is great to listen to from beginning to end. Great beats, personal lyrics, and pretty much everything you love about NIN rolled into one. Don't get me wrong, the other albums are fantastic, but this one really blew me away from the beginning. A MUST HAVE for all NIN fans!!
B00F56AZK4|1.0|Ended up deleting because it wouldn't load not once. Good thing it's free needs some work. Hopefully the problem is fixed soon.

B00D2I8E46|5.0|This is an unexpected and yet a brilliant collaboration. The Title track, Tripwire and Walk me Uptown in particular are outstanding songs!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I liked it but would mot recommend it to everyone I know. It fits people with a particular kind of background I would think, perhaps speaks to a certain set of generation more so than others.
B00BMQDM10|4.0|Got hooked with her after reading the Shopaholic series. This one took me a while to finish as it didn't grab my full attention, but still a good light read to help you unwind and forget about the world for a bit. Good laughs and a heartwarming story. Happy life.

B0083GOVLW|5.0|Tells a vast story with some horrific moments in a medium that makes it more palatable yet searingly poignant simultaneously.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This is a physics based game with a Halloween (vampire) theme.  The graphics are quite good and attractive; the vampire and skeletons are cartoonish and not likely to be scarey to the younger players.  You have to break various obstacles to allow the little vampire to get to his victim.  You move the vampire once the obstacles are cleared by tapping on the screen.  You have to avoid the &#34;holy light.&#34;  If the little vamp hits the holy light he shrieks but doesn't die.  He will die eventually if you keep hitting the lights, but it seems to take a long time.<br /><br />There is a store, but that is only for buying ammo with the coins you earn by clearing levels.  There's a reference to solutions in the store, but it's not clear that those can be purchased.<br /><br />There are achievements you can earn (see them by tapping on &#34;more&#34; on the initial screen) and you choose individual screens by swiping right to left on the initial screen (once you've played some levels.  You get one to three skulls for how efficient you are in clearing a level.  Future levels are locked until you clear a prior level.  One unique feature--you can check for the &#34;three skull&#34; solution from the level menu if you are having trouble.  Perhaps I'll find it repetitive as I keep playing, but for now I'm really enjoying it!<br /><br />This is definitely one of the best holiday themed apps I've seen, and I suspect I'll be playing it a lot in the coming days.<br /><br />Permissions are minimal.
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|I've been a huge Will Smith fan for many years. I've also enjoyed his son's acting in the past. This is one of those movies they shouldn't have wasted the money making it.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Been waiting long time for kindle to get this game. It can be so frustrating especially when you can't see the jellies and at times.as it suddenly ends when moves are still available.
B005PK56TA|4.0|It's an interesting show but I'm kind of offended by by the language and nudity on the show.  This shouldn't be on public television.
B005T87QCI|5.0|This game is awesome! One thing I do want Reliance Games to add in the next update is a Special Move timer. Whenever u go to Free Sparring in hard mode and u get knocked down by a bot every time u get up they do their Special Move and again and again and again.

B0058UXHHK|4.0|4 1/2 out of 5 Stars<br /><br />Love, love this book. It's what I call \\"Fluff Reading\\" but I have no problem with that. It's a nice way to kill a weekend. Ms Swank does a great job of moving the story along without resorting to trite descriptors, as a lot of female authors are prone to do: naming each and every item on the desk, on the wall, and cutsey-wutsey phrases for the sweet little puppy-dog and the hero's dreamboat eyes.<br /><br />Would I actively pursue a series about this particular heroine, as indicated by the subtitle? Probably not. Nothing personal, but sometimes you can call the ball-game by the first inning.<br /><br />[...]

B001MKVDPS|5.0|Wonderfully acted, well written and directed film of the thriller genre, with reincarnation as the premise for all the emotional drama.  Love these well done horror flicks which capture the imagination and focus on a good story rather than the cheap blood and gore that is so ubiquitous these days. Saw this movie in the theaters when it came out in the 70's, and saw it again with my 34 year old son who thought it was a great movie too!

B00AZMFK3K|1.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Star Trek is one of the only television successes to contain some actual science fiction concepts, especially from 3rd season forward in Next Generation, but this movie, like it's crappy reboot predecessor is an action movie with spaceships. Into Darkness has about as much science fiction and boldly going as the recent James Bond, Skyfall, which is to say ... sadly ... none.<br /><br />This terrible writing team has contrived a tapestry of action with artificial amped-up crisis after crisis--- the entire movie is essentially action scenes with a couple of pauses for clich&eacute;d dramatic beats--- \\"You're a loose cannon!\\" \\"This time ... it's personal!\\" \\"Vulcans should be more emotional.\\"<br /><br />Most of the cast is terrible cartoon caricature (Scotty & Bones are abysmal Saturday Night Live sketch performances), except Greenwood as Pike (this actor is directorproof, great in Exotica) and Kirk and Spock are good enough to keep me interested at a very low level.<br /><br />The things lifted from Wrath of Khan are numerous and embarrassing and exemplify everything that is wrong with Hollywood and the remake/reboot machine: No CREATIVITY anywhere. Too much attempt to please the crowd, without any thought, challenge or boldly going anywhere.<br /><br />Looks like JJ Abrams is well set up to continue making Star Wars movies exactly as cluttered and contrived and silly as The Phantom Menace.<br /><br />Cluttered Action Sequences + Thievery (aka \\"homages\\") + Caricatures = Into Darkness<br /><br />It's sad that an innovative franchise is now a dumb, loud and thoughtless lowest common denominator junk. Sci-fi should make you think, but this pile of noise shuts down the thinking process.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a game for all ages. I would like some pointers when I get stuck on a level. Great game, love playing it.
B008220DIC|2.0|The core problems of this piece are problems of most Paul Thomas Anderson work. It works sometimes as allegory and cinematic diorama, but infrequently as drama. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is neither beguiling nor charismatic, the way this role requires. (Compare the various Hoffman speeches to any scene with John Hawkes in the far, far, far superior cult picture, Martha Marcy May Marlene.) From the beginning, we see Hoffman as quick to anger and a cold manipulator and there is no element of seduction in terms of bringing Joaquin Phoenix, and the audience, into the cult. Joaquin is neither charismatic nor very interesting, unless you find a mediocre love interest and drinking interesting.<br /><br />Both actors overdo it and get quite theatrical, though nothing like the abhorrent mugging and apoplectic histrionics of Daniel Day Lewis in There Will Be Blood. Maximum acting and method actor anger (the jail scene and singing bits are quite forced). I can engage in a movie with unlikable characters that are interesting, but these characters are neither and the actors do not bring enough personality to the roles to overcome the limitations of the script. Their relationship does not really work, and it's supposed to be a pillar of the movie--- see the failed melodrama at the end.<br /><br />Like the excellent opening sequences of There Will Be Blood and the Tom Cruise stuff in Magnolia, The Master has about 20+ minutes of material that is truly noteworthy--- the processing sequences. The drama and intensity of these scenes crackle vibrantly in comparison to the other sort of engaging two hours, which plays out like a vague biopic sans pathos. With the exception of the processing scenes and the overwrought acting, the overall piece is mild and less interesting than its subject.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is my favorite game so far.  I'm a Bejewel gamer, and this game ups the challenge for me.  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes these type of match games. The only thing is I end up buying a lot of gold bars for the lives I need to play.  It can get kind of expensive over time.
B008JFUN6E|1.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Like the extremely overrated District 9, Elysium's lone strength is its convincing special effects and its weaknesses are in every other area. Although there is nothing as terribly stupid as the District 9 \\"alien blood that can bond with human DNA ... and also power spaceships,\\" Elysium is heavy handed allegory, amped up drama and dramatically ridiculous.<br /><br />Some of the ships and robots are great to look at---seeing Syd Mead's name in the credits was not a big surprise.<br /><br />Since the days of Hitchcock people seemed to have forgotten that the first and most important job of a director is not to come up with 'cool visuals,' but direct actors. Ergo, the title, 'director.'<br /><br />So congrats to Blomkamp for showing me the first truly terrible Jodie Foster performance. It's like he showed her a 1960s spider-man cartoon and said, 'like this but bigger.' And a lot of her work was dubbed for some reason, likely accent inconsistency (even though it's still inconsistent in the end product). And i am a HUGE William Fichtner fan, but this movie also showcases his career nadir. Sometimes he seems to be imitating Data from Star Trek, other times, sort of German. And Copley as the villain...well if there is a less menacing accent than this, i haven't heard it. And he is of course, way, way over the top as he was in District 9 (though he was decent in Europa Report). Damon is the only performer whose work is credible, probably because he's a big enough star to just say no if Blomkamp wants to turn him into a screaming cartoon.<br /><br />In terms of story, don't expect any science or anything other than good versus evil. Sadly, with rare exception, Hollywood science fiction movies are really just noisy action movies these days, and as a huge science fiction fan I know i'll rarely see any interesting scientific elements in these (though the movies of Duncan Jones and Kosinski do have some smart ideas and are the exceptions). So no, Elysium isn't sci-fi, but just heavy handed action movie allegory, more or less the same class warfare of District 9, so he's already retreading this theme. Then there is the would-be action centerpiece exo-skeletal suit, an idea that doesn't work at all, and isn't well sold visually. Really, as designed, this thing wouldn't work without tearing off fingers and smashing the limbs of its user, which is why most exo-skeletal designs are also armor that could shield a water-based lifeform. In any case, the actions scenes are so shaky and over cut, it's hard to see what's happening regardless. But I never had even a moment of thinking the thing actually functioned or would function.<br /><br />Blomkamp clearly has a political viewpoint---one that I have no issue with at all, except that it makes his writing too pedantic and monochromatic. A strong viewpoint does not make one a good writer. Writing rich people are bad and poor people are good is not dramatically compelling to watch, even if you actually believe things are that simple. Look at the success George RR Martin is having with complex characters...Blomkamp's writing seems like that of a child by comparison. That Elysium is self-important and humorless, doesn't help.<br /><br />And if Blomkamp (who clearly should not write his own movies) really understood science fiction the way actual science fiction writers do---guys like Greg Egan, JMS, Ted Chiang, Arthur C. Clarke, Greg Bear, M. John Harrison, Stephen Baxter, Larry Niven, etc.--- he would not have a future world technology where humans can be rebuilt at an atomic level in the same world as one in which robots fire guns and miss their targets. (!!!) Robots hitting their targets when they fire is near future and to some extent, current; rebuilding bodies at an atomic level (in less than a minute) is very, very, very far future, if ever.<br /><br />But like most Hollywood junk---and the similarly stupid, crazily overrated breakthrough success District 9--- Blomkamp is doing something that looks like science fiction, but isn't.s District 9--- Blomkamp is doing something that looks like science fiction, but isn't.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Have had boosters vanish, been told I need to download the App Store (I'm on a Kindle, it came loaded), had to download from my SD card, and now it won't open at all. Just last night on one of the levels the goal was to score 100,000 points; did that but I had to keep playing and lost when a Candy Bomb ended up exploding. I had a total of 144,000 points, couldn't figure out why I lost.  If not fixed soon, I'll be deleting the game all together.
B005LAJ1PE|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />American Horror works acceptably (until the end) because it keeps so many things in motion--- plots and timelines and things that go bump in the night. Sort of like Heroes (also a 2)-- and no scarier-- the show relentlessly churns and twists to surprising reveal after surprising reveal all delivered with maximum pathos, though a fair share of the performances are good. There is never once a scary moment--- quick cuts and lots of goofy canted shots pretty much guarantee there is never any atmosphere, unless you think music videos are atmospheric. The heavy handed music choices don't help, excepting the cool whistling bit and the piece that sounds stolen from Wojciech Kilar's superb score for (the otherwise crappy) Coppola-directed Dracula (I don't like to put Bram Stoker's name at the front of that one.)<br /><br />So AHS functions as a fast moving and surprising soap opera with a big budget, some good make up fx and some decent acting, which is why it gets a 2. Actually had the last double length episode not been the series nadir--- really bad dialogue and spacious melodrama that fails utterly--- the show would be slightly north of mediocre, but 'afterbirth' is pretty stinky, and the penultimate episode 'birth' not much better.<br /><br />Like most Stephen King stuff that I don't like*, it is essentially modern day fantasy with too much explanation of everything so it barely even functions as suspense, much less horror. Ghosts as lead characters who can appear and disappear at will puts this in a camp with things like Ghost (yes, the Swayze one) and Noel Coward's Blithe Spirit. If you think Ghost and Blithe Spirit are horror, then American Horror Story is horror, but I don't (and you shouldn't) even if AHS has occasional gore and burn make up.<br /><br />Overall, American Horror Story is a mildly engaging soap with better than average acting for a soap and a lot more blood than the average soap, but actually less creepy than the original Dark Shadows show, which actually had atmosphere and let the scenes breathe (and had better music as well).<br /><br />*Horror guys I dig are the old school of Lovecraft, Blackwood and Machen, and also the visceral and immediate books of high tension storyteller Richard Laymon.reepy than the original Dark Shadows show, which actually had atmosphere and let the scenes breathe (and had better music as well).<br /><br />*Horror guys I dig are the old school of Lovecraft, Blackwood and Machen, and also the visceral and immediate books of high tension storyteller Richard Laymon.

B002QYVPI4|3.0|Having just finished reading \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\" I was curious to see how the movie version handled the story. No surprise, it was totally changed from the original version except that a few of the names were the same as in the book.  In the book, the setting was San Francisco, movie - Los Angeles. What I found to be most confusing is that it rained continuously, the characters dressed in 1940 styles and the buildings were hideous, over sized Mayan style structures which gave the set design anything but a futuristic appearance.<br /><br />There was no reference to Androids, Mercer, electric sheep, Isodore & the Specials or any of the other significant characters from the book. The movie put great emphasis on a set design that did not match the story line, shallow character development and a style that is a replica of the 1940's Sam Spade movies.<br /><br />If I had seen the movie first, I would not have bothered reading the book.  As usual, the story, characters and scenes created by a great author like Philip K. Dick far exceeds the interpretation in a movie. I was not surprised but I certainly was disappointed. I can understand why some other reviewers rated it as a great movie because of the usual mix of sex & violence portrayed in an impressive cinematic production. As far as a movie is concerned, I could have rated it higher but regarding the adherence to the original story, I probably rated it too high with a 3-star rating.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I was doing fine until level 23, it cost me$10 to get past that level on my Kindle 8.9 and I'm still on level 23 on small Kindle. I spent hours on both my Kindles, going back and forth between them trying to pass level 23. Now on the 8.9 I'm having the same problem with level 27. Is this how it's done, as you go higher you have to buy extra time to pass the level? Up until all this I was enjoying it.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Grisham has become a boilerplate writer.  He has lured us to his newer books with his fairly good earlier books. This book is an example of how far he has fallen (shoddy writing; weak story) since his early books.  Nothing he has written since can match \\"A Time to Kill.\\"
1451695195|4.0|Clinical and readable.  A good &#34;Book Group&#34; discussion book, depending on the type of group, however.<br />Lots of probing thoughts to think about.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|shadow of the colossus is a loved classic. the remastered 3d edition takes full advantage of the technology. theres nothing like being hurled off the face of a colossus in full bona-fide 3d
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|great cd from start to finish. Bit of a throwback style to it which is great. Bought it pre order and still haven't stopped listening. The amazon free mps3 download was an awesome feature too.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Funny for the whole family. Couldn't wait for the croods to be released our family saw it in the  theater and loved it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|love this app perfect for my kindle fire. I recommend this app to all of my Facebook friends who have any android tablet or phone.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book actually scared me made me laugh almost made me cry.I would most definitely recommend this book to anyone that likes percy jackson
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|If you're into rock, stop reading this review right now and buy this album. Just go do it. It's a must-have for folks like us and will probably go down as one of the great albums of this era. If you're not into rock, stop reading this review right now and buy this album. It will get you into rock. I know that I'm the 331st person to write a review of this album on Amazon and that if none of the other reviews convinced you to buy ...Like Clockwork, mine probably won't either, but hopefully I can find something that hasn't already been said over and over again, and then say it well.<br /><br />Keep Your Eyes Peeled: 7/10. Would be a standout song on many other albums, but not up to par with the rest of the album. Well-placed as an intro song, but didn't really stick with me.<br /><br />I Sat By the Ocean: 8/10. A good, fun song sandwiched between two rather gloomy pieces. Has a twinge of melancholy lurking in the background, but it keeps an upbeat sound throughout.<br /><br />The Vampyre of Time and Memory: 9/10. QOTSA's probably best known for the fast-and-heavy sound evident in songs like Go With the Flow and 3's & 7's, but I've always felt that many of their best efforts have been their softer songs like In the Fade or Make It Wit Chu, and this is no exception.<br /><br />If I Had a Tail: 9/10. This song's intro makes me giddy just about every time I hear it. The whole thing is excellent, though. It's light. It's whimsical. It's great for roadtrips.<br /><br />My God is the Sun: 9/10. Songs like My God is the Sun are QOTSA's bread and butter. It starts out fast and heavy and doesn't let up at all for the whole rest of the song. I don't think it's as good overall as some of their other songs of this sort, like the ones I mentioned under The Vampyre of Time and Memory, but it invokes a sense of grandeur and power that's lacking in those other pieces.<br /><br />Kalopsia: 7/10. Wasn't crazy about this song. It's grand and theatric, as well as very dark (and I enjoy these things), but it takes a certain mood to enjoy. It's just not always listenable.<br /><br />Fairweather Friends: 10/10. This was a joint effort between Homme & Co. and a handful of other accomplished musicians, including Dave Grohl and Sir Elton John, and the eclecticism and talent of the artists on this song shows clearly. Epic and funny.<br /><br />Smooth Sailing: 8/10. Heavy beat, crunchy guitars, sexed-up lyrics. Classic QOTSA material right here.<br /><br />I Appear Missing: 10/10. Not much can be said about this song without simply repeating the gushing praise already heaped upon it. I Appear Missing is a serious contender for the best rock song of this young decade and was an instant favorite of mine. In a lot of ways, it feels like the culmination of all the tension simmering underneath QOTSA's music for the last several years.<br /><br />...Like Clockwork: 10/10. QOTSA hit it out of the park with this thoughtful and beautiful song. It's the perfect ending to the album, especially in light of what Josh Homme has said about writing the album: \\"I'm usually [a guy who] would spit on the floor and say `let's go.' I've always played my way out of trouble...People usually try and run from chaos. But this time, wherever it was most uncomfortable, that's where I decided to go.\\"<br /><br /> I'm glad Queens of the Stone Age made the effort to dredge through the uncomfortable things in life to inspire this album. It's paid off a hundredfold and taken them to new heights as musicians. ...Like Clockwork has of course drawn comparisons to Songs for the Deaf, but I think each of those albums was perfect for the time it was released. Songs for the Deaf needed to be made, but then Queens of the Stone Age needed to move on to ...Like Clockwork, and the music world is better off having heard them both.ese things), but it takes a certain mood to enjoy.

1250030951|4.0|I was so blown away with Fangirl, Rainbow Rowell, you are officially one of my favorite YA contemporary writers in 2013! Fangirl was a coming of age novel with the perfect characters who where fun and bubbly. I honestly I fell in love with the characters and plotline. This is my second book by Rowell and it's not going to be my last for sure.<br /><br />Cath and Wren are twin sisters who loved writing their own take on Gemma T. Lesile's Simon Snow books but when the college life comes Cath and Wren are separated  Cath never believed this would happen and she doesn't know whether to open up to the new people and environment around her, especially to her roommate, Reagan and new guy, Levi. To add to her stress, she is busy in her world of Simon Snow and worrying about her dad 24/7. I love Fangirl ever since the first page, Rowell showcases Cath in such a relatable and fun way I loved it! She knows how to balance fun and seriousness in Fangirl and even in Eleanor and Park. I grew with Cath throughout the whole novel and she is definitely memorable, especially with Levi. What I loved even more was when Rowell took a different approach in writing these fun and laugh out loud scenes! I especially loved the skinny b*tich part a lot and had me dying!<br /><br />There was so romance in Fangirl which was a big aspect in contemporary books, but here it was done perfectly with Cath and Levi. I'm not talking about the typical love triangle, but their relationship was fun and it's something YA readers would respond to. Cath grew so much out of their relationship I was blown away at how Rowell seamlessly weaved it into the book. Fangirl was of relationships like between Cath and Simon Snow, Cath and Wren. Reagan and Levi, it was done simplistic without overwhelming the reader!<br /><br />I loved Fangirl and I'm sure any YA reader would say so too! It those curl under the cover book where you would turn the pages to see how Cath story starts and ends. It was a eye opening book about growing up and learning when your story begins. I was blown away with the characters, the relationships, and honesty I would read it again in a heart beat!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|One of the greatest persons of our times, this biography is very detailed on his life and works, and is a great read!
B000002J09|5.0|Here we are 40 years later & now my daughter & grandson also love Led Zeppelin. One can't go wrong with a classic like this one.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|Great choice for<br />an hour plus of pure fun.<br />I loved it.<br />The actors are legends.<br />And it looks like they came to have fun.
B000002J1U|5.0|40 years later & now not only myself & child, but my grandson also loves this music.  Classic is always in style.
0744014956|3.0|my primary complaint is that it is a collectors edition and it did not come with a pull out poster sized map, just one page maps, that are not the best at helping you get where you wanna go.
B000002J03|5.0|40 years later & both my children & grandchildren love Led Zeppelin.  You can't go wrong with classics like this one.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|I am not a big fan of CGI in these types of movies.  It is too cartoonish.  The movie reminded me a Batman movie.
B0013FYTA8|5.0|This is my 4th copy.  My grandson & daughter have taken previous copies.  Now I have an extra hidden in case the one I listen to regularly 'disappears'.  The TOD 'Theory of a Deadman' CD is also just as good as this one.  I can't wear it out.  I never get tired of it.
B000FC2PKG|2.0|This is the 1st book I read by Lisa Gardener. The story started really good but as it went on it got a little boring. The storyline only partly interested me. The story had little to no action & it had no suspense. I only finished this book to see what happens to Bobby. For the first book of a series it should have grabbed the reader more.
B000M341QE|5.0|Every time I see this movie I see something different.  The action and intrigue keeps you glued to the very end.  Amazing cast of characters.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|I didn't know what to think when we rented this. I was pleasantly surprised by the humorous lines of Brad Pitt. It was a movie with an unusual mix of suspense, humor, surprise and heart pounding scenes all in one. Being a woman, I did have to close my eyes on a few parts. They won't be for the faint hearted, but Inglorious Basterds is a must see. We enjoyed it even though we found it a little more unusual than most Hollywood movies.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|I mean, Will Smith is good comedian and everything, but sometimes his acting is a little overacted. His kid is on the same way,a little annoying.
B00FI7XBIS|4.0|I'm not one for physics puzzles but if it's the FAOtD, I'll give it a try. I usually find them too difficult, but this one wants you to win. it's not much of an edge but it can help you stay motivated. Once you're in a level, dragging around the screen to look at the rest of the level is a little slow. I took away one star because the women are presented as rewards, therefore objectified. They also don't need to be shaped so lasciviously. A fun game doesn't need to include sexist imagery.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I really liked!  Totally great story, couldn't put the book down.  I will definitely read the rest of the series.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I... :( this was a wonderful book to read Mr.Green, I don't know what to do now.<br />I cried. She cried. He cried. We all cried, can't wait for the movie.
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|Not good, I had great expectation of that movie, but it did not meet that expectation. It is a sloppy job.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really enjoy this app. I find it comes in handy. It's not complicated at all. It stores all you past equations and problems and has all the buttons you'll need for simple but useful mathematics. It even has the fraction button. It also has a step by step guide on how to use it and where to fond everything. I really recommend this all.
B004G5ZY7E|1.0|I have tried a couple of these books, and based on reviews really wanted to like the books.  In all cases I found the stories too slow going, boring , and unable to finish...  I don't know what others see in these stories , but there are to many others out there with more interesting characters, plots, sub plots, and climaxes than Harry Hole...  i just don't get it!!!!
B00594XOZU|3.0|It says currently unavailable when I try to download it. I've never had this problem before. I deleted it a while back and now I want to download it again.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a really good story but I just wish it would have been a little longer and could see what happened with them.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great.a love how fun and mind questing it is .I,also<br />Like how you get to update the theme and charters .
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Amazing how kids movies have changed but my kids enjoyed the songs and story line, despite the animation being a little dated. Great movie! Would buy again.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Works great on the kindal fire great app. Worth the wif to download. Very helpful to find weather. Its a great app.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|Great movie and great story line. Quite a bit of deviation from the book, but difficult to make such a short book into a feature length movie. I thought they adaptation was appropriate and entertaining. The grandma (Betty White) was hilarious and entertaining for parents as well. Would buy again.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I am totally happy with my mouse. It is everything it said it was. Only thing I am not enthused about is the fact that the drivers for the mouse aren't on Macs. Still, blue is not the worst color a mouse can light up.
B00EOO55GW|1.0|By far the worst A7X ever produced! Dont waste your time or money on this compilation of useless noise. It reminds me of Metallica's \\"BLACK\\" album....and the downfall that followed. Believe me, I really do like this band and I hate having this view. A7X should of held on to Portnoy why they had him.........new drummer is pathetic compared to the REV or Portnoy......just my opinion....would have given the album \\"NO\\" stars, but it doesn't let me have that option.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love candy crush saga it's terrific.The.music is calm and soothing.I'M really pleased that it came to amazon thank you !!!!!!!!!!!
B005DJREJS|5.0|Really great show. Very funny. Could not stop watching! Hope season 2 is just as good if now better! Highly recommend.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Very well done! Great plot and I will definitely recommend this movie. It showed a more gentle side of him.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|The effort required to read Cloud Atlas is repaid early by author David Mitchell's lyrical prose. Actually six novels, written in six different styles, nested one within another, Cloud Atlas makes the point that we are all connected, that our actions ripple through time. It's not as complicated as it sounds, but the characters and the stories of their interwoven lives will haunt you. I re-read whole chapters (I'll leave it to you to discover why that's not such a simple thing to do) when I need a Mitchell fix of karmic adventure, comedy, or mystery.  Cloud Atlas is a  strange and wonderful book.
B00BGI08GG|5.0|this is a fantastic action movie, my wife and i are glued on it.<br />i highly reccomend it to anyone that like action<br />i look forward to season 2.<br />Mike
B0039208JE|5.0|Anyone who rates this one star is under the age of 25, and never watched this movie in theatres. looks better and sounds better, and A classic. Best Batman movie ever.
B00G32VYDG|3.0|Afterlife Men in Black sums this movie up.  And that had So much potential.  At times the movie nearly realizes it at times.  But then it loses it by going too over the top.  It really feels like someone pitched the idea and some executive got ahold of it and pushed in various tropes and action pieces...and it is worse for it.
B00ESY77LO|3.0|I thought the movie was ok, but a bit strange. The story itself was weird and predictable, but the costumes, the homes, the parties, the colors were absolutely amazing. I found myself LOVING some of the woman's outfits. I would watch the movie again, but only for the glamour.
B00FWLSOOG|5.0|Simply put, if you don't like this movie, you went into it for the wrong reasons.  Giant robots fighting giant monsters...that is the only reason to watch this.  And it does it perfectly.  Everything else this movie does well is just gravy.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The story was mesmerizing and engaging.  You never knew where it was going next.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  I even liked it better than the Kite Runner.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|This is delightfully innocent good fun and with some assistance from a practiced player I think even young children can get the hang of it.
B00E9PMMX0|3.0|I wonder if the changes were made to intentionally detract from the quality of the originals, bringing them a little closer to their deformed second cousins, the prequels.  Yes?  No?  I will admit a few of the cosmetic adjustments were nice.  However, most of the obvious changes, especially to IV, were bad.  Greedo shooting first and the additional scene with Jabba, for me, were reminiscent of the kind of stuff found in the later prequels.<br /><br />Han is a survivalist, who happens to have a bounty on his head.  Shooting first when confronted in a life-threatening situation is par for the course.  Right or wrong, it's the world he comes from; part of what makes him a compelling character.  Greedo shooting first deflates Han's first big \\"solo\\" scene on top of being poorly \\"updated\\" by Lucas: Greedo takes his shot while sitting only a few feet from his target, his blaster already drawn and sighted -- and managed to only hit the wall?  Then there is inserting Jabba into IV.  Why?  It added nothing and detracted everything.  Introducing a character far in advance of them making an actual appearance gives them more dramatic weight (no pun intended); Jabba was more affective as the unseen menace before his entrance in Return of the Jedi.  Besides, we receive all the exposition we need about Jabba and Han in the scene with Greedo; so why add a scene that just slows the story?  Finally, like the scene with Greedo, the CGI is poorly done: Jabba looks more like a cartoon character found on a cereal box than the ruthless, sniveling monster we later see.<br /><br />Recently, I caved and bought the Blu-ray set with just IV, V and VI, which look stunning on Blu-ray.  The three-pack only has the commentaries and includes DVD of each one.  The prequels have a couple of great moments, however I found them ultimately unsatisfying and over-produced.  I'm guessing George Lucas just figures the original versions will fade away from the collective memory, overtaken by his Disney-fied reimagining of them.  Luckily, I grabbed the Star Wars DVD releases that contained the unedited versions as bonus discs back in 2008.<br /><br />Whimsical aside: I once imagined Jar-Jar sitting on the floor in front an enormous, blazing fireplace at Skywalker Ranch, dumbly picking through the pieces of a child-sized jigsaw puzzle; George Lucas looks on lovingly from a distant staircase, reimagining his beloved in a new movie from a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...
B00G118LYY|4.0|As a grandmother new to the world of children's apps, the technique of playing Toca Cars baffles me. My two young grandsons, however, have great fun with it. They have not yet developed skill driving Toca Cars but they love it anyway. They crash, drive through lakes, skid into fields, knock down stop signs and generally drive uncontrollably. Whee!
B00E8IC7C4|4.0|Purchased this at the local Walmart for $12.96.  Has a sticker indicating &#34;2-disc special edition for limited time only&#34;.  However, it contains only the standard issue of each film (&#34;The Matrix&#34; was the tenth anniversary disc).  Not sure what the &#34;special edition&#34; bit was about?  Perhaps an initial run of this set had something extra, but no information about it anywhere online.<br /><br />Still, three great movies for the price can't be beat.
B0041KVZ1I|5.0|Fast delivery, nice product quality. That's what an on line purchase is based on. And, isn't it one of the best LP ever made?
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love candy crush saga!!! This is another one of those games where you Match three of more of the same thing and you get points and more fall down. But it has many unique features that make it different than all the rest. When you Match four of the same candy you get a a special striped candy. When you Match that one it clears a whole row of candy. When you Match five of the same color you get a chocolate candy. When you Match this with another candy all of that color disappears. There are also wrappers candies that clear all of the candies around it. There are also goals for each level. For example one is getting a cherry down to the bottom of the screen by matching the candy below it causing it to fall down. I will not explain all of them but you can find out on your own :). There are lots of cool features and other stuff in this app and I recommend this app to anyone especially to anyone who's a fan of this kind of game. The only thing that I don't like is that it can be really frustrating sometimes. For example right now I am stuck on level 27. I can not pass this level for the life of me!!! And you also have lives. When you lose a level, you lose a life. Once you lose all five lives up you have to wait to play again. Over all this app is pretty good. But if you don't have a lot of patience, this can sometimes be really frustrating.<br />Hope this review helped!!:) -izzy
B003ASLJK4|5.0|The writing is a little unnatural at times, but the acting in this film is incredible. Streep and Eastwood do a fabulous job of portraying that once in a lifetime love that cannot be. Anyone who has known the \\"damned if you do/damned if you don't\\" type of choice in love will feel the emotion of this piece and completely overlook any of its failings. It's an incredibly moving piece that only gets more meaningful.
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|Hangover 3 left me scratching my head.  I decided to skip Hangover 2 when I saw it was basically just going to be a retread of the original but in Thailand.  However literally almost every joke until the end falls flat.  I caught myself chuckling, but not really laughing, exactly twice in the first 90 minutes, until the last scene before the credits.  There is also a end-credit scene that was just rather outlandish than funny.  Alan, in particular, was strange in Hangover 1 and clueless, but well-intentioned.  Here, he is just a brat who thinks everything he does it funny.  Unfortunately, until he returns to character in that final scene,  Animal lovers in particular will be bothered by the (assumedly) fake cruelty to a giraffe, a chicken, and dogs.  What a waste of talented actors, my money and 90 minutes of my time.
B00BAXFAOW|3.0|Not as good as his other work.  Instead of drawing insight from facts, the book read as if he searched for stories to fit his thesis.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It has been a long time coming for Candy Crush on Kindle. I really enjoy it, but I don't like the constant push to buy powerups, extra moves etc. But all in all, it's a challenging, fun game.
B000RLFJQ2|2.0|Movie plot etc. were fine but it just was too much of the same thing. Car chases and plot twists that made the movie too long and ultimately boring.
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|Doodle Jump is one of those games that are super simple but still fun for multiple ages. I already had Doodle Jump free but my 7 yr old begged me to upgrade. I relented because some of the 7 backgrounds looked interesting to me as well (particularly the Ninja board).  Fun game, well worth $.99 to pass away some time
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the game and especially the halloween version.  If you love both of the movies, you'll love the game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Soooo glad it came to Kindle this past week.  Time to catch up to everyone that have been playing while I haven't.
B00A9X9VAI|2.0|But the people who make the previews don't make the movies. I wanted to love it, but it fell way short. Confusing. Holes in the plot. Didn't buy that Willis and Levitt were the same guy. Good actors, some great ideas, but ultimately and unfortunately, not a very good movie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|challenging fun that can frustrate you and I hope this is helpful I guess. so try it out if you like a bit of a challenge
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Purchased as a download while waiting for friends .  Everyone should read this book, so much insight and an easy read
B002NQ3AAQ|5.0|This movie will make you laugh and cry. The acting is superb. It's about a working class family in Northern England who's youngest family member just wants to dance. And he will dance right into your heart. I won't spoil it by telling the story line so please watch for yourself and enjoy as much as I did.
0452289963|5.0|This book is pretty amazing.  I've read the power of now and &#34;now&#34; I'm going to read this.  I received two books which I thought was a little odd, but I gave one to a homeless surfer kid in LA.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|I'm upset about this game.......First ,it takes forever to gain the points and $$$ to upgrade your weapons, but when i finally got to the second region, there were issues with the download, and when it finally is all said and done, I lost almost $20,000 worth of money and 15 gold coins.  This may not seem like a lot, but each &#34;hunt&#34; only yields an average of $400, and the coins are extremely hard to come by.  So, now I am on the second safari with underpowered weapons, no money, and basically starting all over again.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I haven't enjoyed a book this much in a long time.  I read this straight through - barely taking breaks. What a great book.
B00FWLSLJ4|2.0|Boring.  I'm a big fan of action films and loved IP man..for instance. Huge fan of the avenger movies, etc etc. This movie has some cool effects and ONE good actor. Mr. Always Sunny in Philly. He's great. The rest of the movie was just boring. It didn't suck, but not worth $5. Really, it's a $1 week long rental.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game!!! For some reason I can't get it to connect to my Facebook account but either way I still love it
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Easy to install and contains all of the features they claim it has. A complete organizer and file system for your notes, documents and media files.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The time period, the actors, the staging, the story and the scenery - better than ever.  Can't wait for next season.
1781162646|4.0|King goes into detail a lot.  Other authors would bore you, but this guy makes it wonderful.  the book is a great read.
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|For someone as young as she is, Lorde's voice is extremely well developed. It resonates throughout her debute album with precision and intrigue. Her lyrics are thoughtful and relevant. A really great album. I highly recommend it!
B000VK99Z6|4.0|We got turned on to Simon Pegg from his work in &#34;Shaun of the Dead&#34;. While Hot Fuzz is not quite as funny, it's worth a watch. I'd recommend it.

B00D8CSVLW|4.0|Sycamore Row's premise is brilliant in its simplicity - a contested will that ticks all the boxes of sexual scandal, racism and dark historic secrets.<br /><br />Grisham has done surprisingly well crafting a realistic, interesting story around this, and while heavy on the details legal thriller fans should be kept entertained throughout.<br /><br />Those looking for a little more high-drama, tension and characters you can sink your teeth into will be disappointed. Throughout the novel I found myself uncertain who to root for. Sure I was caught up in the questions the novel raised but I didn't care enough about the consequences for anyone that I really felt moved by the novel.

B00BXI0IHS|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book.Relevant to Australian history with poverty of England, sending criminals to Australia,the story of Banks' journey with Captain Cook, the visit of Darwin on the Beagle to Australia. The writing and descriptions wonderfully eloquent, the obssessions so clearly communicated. The character developments were all excellent.
B006LSZECO|4.0|If you are questioning the publicity on this book, then read it.  I think you will like it.  I like the main character but like a good main character he has flaws.  Most of all the book keeps your attention.
0316010669|5.0|I loved this book!  Each anecdote provided a valuable lesson about how we think.  It was so much fun to read that I had to stop myself from reading it all in one sitting.  The writing style is warm, smart, and sensible.  What a great read!  I enjoyed Blink so much that I might try the Tipping Point next!<br /><br />As for those negative reviews...do those people really think that a book has to be an academic tome to be worthy of reading?  There is nothing wrong with a survey approach to a topic--that is light enough to engage the common man, but serious enough to be compelling.  Don't Blink!  Buy this book and enjoy!
0802473156|5.0|This book is great and it is definitely an eye-opener as to why relationships sometimes don't work out. Or I should say why they change and we can't help but wonder why. I am now more open to listen and seeing signs what makes my partner happy. And even if I may not like it or prefer a different type of love language, I know that at least I can try to make him happy by changing the way of how I show my love to him.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Set-up is so simple. Quality of video is great. All it needs is for more apps to be released and all will be great.
B00G6Q29KQ|5.0|I love Brandt Legg's books and was thrilled when I saw that his next novel was finally out! If you have never read any of his work, you're in for a real treat!!!  \\"Outmove\\" is the third exciting novel in Brandt Legg's series (the previous two books are \\"Outview\\" and \\"Outin\\"). In this third book, Nate, the protagonist, becomes the leader of the revolutionary movement against the dark forces of Omnia. He's wiser and stronger now, but he still needs to get advice from four more mystics to complete his quest. Sounds exciting, doesn't it? But that's just the beginning.<br /><br />What I love about Brandt Legg's books is the deeper level of thinking and deeper issues that he invites us to explore, all in a very easy-to-read and entertaining way. \\"What if?\\" and other hypothetical questions are always fun ones to ponder, and you will have plenty of opportunities to do that when you read this book. What are the best ways to drive innovation? What societal structures are most conducive to innovative thinking? How does money affect societies? What could the alchemists really accomplish? And why didn't JP Morgan board the Titanic, like he was supposed to? And this is just a quick little sampling of the kinds of things this book will make you think about. What a fantastic journey!<br /><br />The nature of creativity, spiritual understanding of the world, material advancement vs. preservation of old traditions, reincarnation, free will - all these are issues that Nate has to deal with as he pursues his quest. As a reader, you will be right there with him. And like, Nate after the first two books (no, no spoiler here about how this book ends!!!), you will emerge a wiser person. Highly recommended.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love being able to access my account from anywhere and being able to watch my auctions as both a buyer and seller!!!
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|Given the limitations of the genre, the movie succeeds in providing a 2 hour window of escapism.  The acting is decent and not pretentious. Special effects are high quality.  The quality of the HD streaming was uneven and not worth the price.
B00BAXFECK|1.0|It plods, it gets no where, it is too long, is boring, there is no relief from the negativity. I found myself not caring what happened to the main character and just wanted it to end. What a waste of money. How did this terrible book every get published?
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Very good special effects and an excellent storyline that ties in with the old original Wrath of Khan movie. Good cast,well acted and directed. Trekkers will pick up on references to past Star Trek movies and TV series. Recommended.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|The action-packed and contentious conclusion to a much loved series that left me disappointed, but that simultaneously had the power to shatter me, surprise me and bring me to tears. It challenges the reader to think beyond the expected and be brave.<br /><br />3.5 stars.<br /><br />Well crap on a cracker, people. It ends. I avoided all spoilers, mentions, reviews when Allegiant was released because I didn’t want to be biased. I wanted an unadulterated experience all my own and even though I heard enough to know people were disappointed, I was hoping to staunchly disagree. I can’t say that unfortunately. I’ve been trying to objectively process my own thoughts on it and in the end, I just wanted this book to be as awesome as the other two were. I’m not sure if I’m disappointed or angry or a mix of both or maybe neither, but I just didn’t understand some of her choices. Isn’t there an unspoken rule that if the first two books rock your world, the final book should rock it even harder?! I’ll go through my thoughts in a way that will not spoil the story, I promise. And I will say that there were some good parts. Truthfully, I’ve been so invested in the story that I still couldn’t put it down. I cared about what happened and cared a lot about the characters… I just imagined the story unfurling in a different way. But alas, it’s not my story.<br /><br />I’m going to write this review differently than I usually do, organizing my thoughts around the major points of discussion.<br /><br />THE TRUTH<br /><br />“There’s so much that was a lie, it’s hard to figure out what was true, what was real, what matters.”<br /><br />We finally learn the truth behind the factions, behind who everyone really is and why. So much of this series has been about understanding who you are, what you believe in, who you align with. At the beginning of the series, it’s about choosing your faction according to your true self, your true motivations. In Allegiant, it’s more about what makes you, YOU. It’s about defining yourself beyond the factions, leaving the characters to ponder who they are intrinsically. This notion is particularly significant for Tobias, who has grown up with one tyrant as a parent, and another who was thought dead and was not, and subsequently has become a tyrant.  It was evident in this book just how broken Tobias really was, how desperate he was to believe he’s more than the result of his parents.<br /><br />“I was afraid of my considerable capacity to kill…That was the first time I’ve ever said those words out loud, and now I hear how strange they are. How many young men fear that there is a monster inside of them?”<br /><br />Roth takes an allegorical approach to defining the characters, enlivening the nature versus nurture debate. But I believe that in the end she makes the point that who you are is defined by what you do for the people you love and for the things you believe in.<br /><br />“I don’t belong to Abnegation, or Dauntless, or even the Divergent… I belong to the people I love, and they belong to me-they, and the love and loyalty I give them, form my identity far more than any word or group ever could.”<br /><br />Another issue for me was that there are a lot of groups battling each other and it truthfully got a little confusing. It was almost as if Roth just packed way too much into the plot and made it more complicated than it needed to be. I was constantly trying to discern who was who, if they were good or bad, who the “good” group should be and what the “right” thing was in the end. I’m all for digging deep and making it challenging for the reader, but you don’t want to push it so far that it gets too confounding and the reader checks out.<br /><br />DUAL POVS<br /><br />This was one of the aspects I was most excited about and perhaps one of the ones I’m most disappointed with. The alternating POVs were too similar, almost monotone at times. I actually had to go back and check whose narrative I was reading a few times. I felt like I wanted Four’s POV to be stronger and more striking. He lost a little of his ethos in my opinion. I totally get (and like) the fact that he was broken and part of his character’s arc was to work through those issues, but he just wasn’t as badass as I wanted him to be. He felt weak and clumsy at times. On the other hand, I liked the insight it gave me into how Four felt about Tris. On some level, they really are kindred spirits… so alike in their resoluteness and bravery, but their internal struggles and motivations are divergent (no pun intended) and that causes a rift to grow between them. Nonetheless, it was fulfilling to see how much they did love each other despite their differences.<br /><br />“He is stronger than anyone I know, and warmer than anyone else realizes; he is a secret that I have kept, and will keep, for the rest of my life.”<br /><br />BE BRAVE<br /><br />“I suppose a fire that burns that bright is not meant to last.”<br /><br />In the acknowledgements, Veronica Roth tells her readers to “be brave” and I do think a lot of the story revolves around bravery, weaving in moments of tremendous courage in its plot twists. Brave choices. Brave sacrifices. Brave abandon. I liked this thematic framework and was really moved by her words on bravery at the story’s conclusion… I would say it brought me to tears, but I was already shedding them at that point. And perhaps, taking a cue from Dauntless, Veronica Roth’s intent was to be brave in how she ended the story. Personally, I DO NOT mind endings that are emblematic, especially in the dystopian genre where happy endings are not a fair expectation, I just honestly didn’t think her choices were necessary.<br /><br />I think most readers likely already know there are deaths in the conclusion and I tried to process the impact of what happens through the choices of others who have made similar choices. In George R.R. Martin’s desultory approach to offing characters in his The Song of Fire and Ice series, he has such a large cast of characters that the story lives on beyond the deaths it racks up, there is no one impervious to death in his books and you get that point from day one. The expectation is set… a silent contract signed between author and reader, and the story continues to take shape after the deaths (although many were indeed shocking). In Breaking Bad, the final death in the series is absolutely necessary and there is no other way the story should end.  On the flip side, for all you Dexter fans, he, on the other hand, should have died, not lived. In making choices to kill characters – main or supporting – one must do so with care… it has to feel right and necessary. Allegiant’s story, in my opinion, could’ve gone in a completely different direction and still imparted a bigger, thoughtful message with incredible power. It was too unexpected and unwarranted, in my opinion. I won’t reveal how it ended obviously, but in my mind I envisioned it end in hand-to-hand/watch it burn kind-of style. I was left not only with my grief, but with a dissatisfaction that one of our protagonists was not happy and I strongly feel that happiness was well deserved after everything that had transpired leading up to the final moments.<br /><br />“There are so many ways to be brave in this world. Sometimes bravery involves laying down your life for something bigger than yourself, or for someone else. Sometimes it involves giving up everything you have ever known, or everyone you have ever loved, for the sake of something greater.<br /><br />But sometimes it doesn’t.<br /><br />Sometimes it is nothing more than gritting your teeth through pain, and the work of every day, the slow walk toward a better life.<br /><br />That is the sort of bravery I must have now.”<br /><br />IN SUMMARY<br /><br />This isn’t a boring book. It was well written, embedding many heartfelt moments I desperately wanted. I also really loved how she weaved in some flashbacks from Divergent… those were incredibly powerful scenes with good timing. I admit, I cried a little harder remembering those times. I LOVED the first two books, I just didn’t understand all her choices. In the end, I’m not ready to burn my books or start any kind of riot.  If you are a fan of the first two books, don’t avoid the third just because of opinions like mine or that of others. Finish the series, see it through to the end. Personally, I’m glad I read this book, I really am, and I do think the end was powerful nonetheless. I leave you with Veronica Roth’s own words from Allegiant…<br /><br />“Some things are hard to let go of.”s. In George R.R.

006202406X|3.0|This book was a major letdown for me. The beginning was GREAT. But it kind of drifted off from there. It was more slow paced and it had way less action. I now realize why Roth had both view points in this book. Because she planned on killing the main character. I cried when I was reading Tobias's point of view. I felt his emotions. That part, sadly, was very well written. But I don't understand WHY she had to die. I mean what happened to a happy ending? It was like BOOM she dies BOOM the end. This book just made me very disappointed and heart broken. You've really let me down with this last book.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|this game rocks but when you download it takes for ever to download it to your kindle but all in all it awsome
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is a fun game,but there should be more than seventy levels and there needs to be more ways to get gems besides leveling up or spending real money for them not everyone can afford to spend real money on a game.

B00ARN0ZF0|2.0|I was hoping that this would bring some genuine scary moments.  It doesn't.  The acting is decent enough. The story line could have been done better.  My biggest gripe is that they used camera's throughout the house and instead of seeing what the video captured ( a girl floating above her bed might warrant a view or two) so that they can know what is going on.  But alas, this movie could be better titled &#34;Paranormal Inactivity.&#34;

0345494768|5.0|A must for any Star Wars Fan, but also a great read for any movie fan.<br />Fascinating look at the process of making the Star Wars movie and the trials and tribulations that George Lucas and the entire cast and crew went through to get the film to the big screen.  Filled with behind-the-scenes photos and concept art (which ultimately secured the film it's backing by 20th Century Fox), this book really is the ultimate historical account of the creation of Star Wars: A New Hope.
157421327X|1.0|I wasn't happy with this book, it's very thin and had very little instruction. I was unfamiliar with the concept and even with this book it have yet to try

B005LAIIGW|5.0|Ryan Stone is having trouble truly living. Since her daughter's death, she just doesn't have the desire to find joy. She, a bio-medical engineer, is on her first expedition as an astronaut. As she is outside the shuttle repairing the Hubble telescope, debris from a Russian satellite does a lot more damage to equipment than expected. She is left alone to survive in space. She has to face her terror and take some chances in order to save herself.<br /><br />This movie is basically Sandra Bullock's soliloquy. She carries this movie single-handedly, and she does a great job, too. George Clooney has a small but important role in this film, which he pulls off perfectly. The special effects are very, very convincing, and I found myself lost in the action of this movie. I watched the 3-D version, but, sadly, I did not see much difference. That effect was lost on me.<br /><br />This is a terrifying, yet tender movie about a woman discovering her hidden strength and desire to live. This is a feel-good movie. I loved it!

B008FSCNTK|2.0|I have long thought that Diana Krall's singing was a series of mannerisms in search of a style. Pleasant, but without distinction.<br />It was less that her piano playing, and popular because there was so little competition in the blonde piano/vocalist class.<br /><br />In \\"Glad Rag Doll\\" which is more \\"Raggedy Glad Doll,\\" Diana tries a new direction as she coos, purrs and mumbles through a hodgepodge of songs and eras, sounding at times, like a girl with a mouth full of caramel. Sometimes a jazz singer's feel for lyrics comes through, while most of the time she's unfocused, and as raggedy about diction and voice support as a typical rock singer.  The material doesn't mesh either. How do you fit the sensibility of \\"We Just Couldn't Say Goodbye\\" with \\"Lonely Avenue?\\" They belong in different albums.<br /><br />Is Diana's Blues-edge her future? Well, how do you un-learn sophistication? This album comes uncomfortably close to self-caricature--like the poorly judged album photos that resemble Marlene Dietrich in \\"The Blue Angel.\\" Is Diana suggesting The \\"Blues Angel?\\"  Someone is trying too hard.<br /><br />The arrangements have their moments, but mostly are too busy, and are more rock-and-blues, than jazz, and ill-fitting for much of the older material. Like Diana, they are more mannered than inspired. They inhibit jazz singing. (Note: distorted guitars are not musical.)<br /><br />Is rock/blues her new direction? Rock is a step down from jazz, in style, sophistication and technical accomplishment. She should reign here--the competition<br />is even thinner. But I doubt it. She's too old and too \\"branded\\" to be welcomed into today's rock and blues world.<br /><br />I think she needs to go back and re-study Sinatra, Fitzgerald, Crosby and Peggy Lee-- allegedly the reasons she got into the music business. Their voices sound lived-in. They didn't try on styles like a change of clothes. Diana might be better off returning to her jazz roots, and finding a cleaner, more mature vocal approach befitting a woman nearing fifty, and staying with it. There are too many grand songs, neglected and unsung, yet to be rediscovered.<br /><br />.
B00DCRE7M0|4.0|I really like this CD by James Labrie, this is my first introduction to his work outside of Dream Theater.  I love Dream Theater and find this CD to be fairly similar and therefore also very enjoyable.  I don't think there is anything particularly unique or outstanding to warrant a 5 star review.  I am going to try the new Labrie solo record soon, I read he has added a harsh vocalist for more diversity to the style!
B008JFUO36|4.0|I'd heard many terrible things about this film before watching it, almost enough to make me not bother, but I'm a sucker for sci-fi blockbusters so I gave it a try. The good news is that it's not a bad as I'd heard, the bad news is that while it's reasonably entertaining it's far from a good film.<br /><br />At its heart this is an Independence Day type of affair and while it tries to take itself more seriously any purists watching it would be cursing the poor science of it. Unfortunately it's not as much fun as Independence Day either, however it's more modern visual effects do provide some stunning scenes.<br /><br />The story is simple, aliens attack Earth and are beaten off with a nuclear attack that irradiates vast regions of Earth, rendering it unihabitable. Most of the survivors ship of to a colony at Titan, but two stay behind to protect essential assets needed to support the far off colony. Remnents of the invading aliens still survive on the Earth's surface and are trying to hamper the operation.<br /><br />Things aren't quite what they seem and the story really unfolds from there. It's fairly predictable as to where the story is heading, but the journey isn't too bad. The cast all do a reasonable job with their roles, but there's nothing inspired about any of it. It's a sci-fi blockbuster that goes through the motions, an ok watch, but nothing more.
B00E0G5U4G|5.0|I was a huge Carcass fan but haven't followed them or the comeback at all.  I was very surprised to see the excellent reviews and immediately bought the CD for my own listening pleasure.  I have to say this release would slot in perfectly between Heartwork and Swansong or even between Necroticism and Heartwork.  I had no idea after 17 years that Carcass could and would sound so heavy and interesting.  Bill Steer's riffs and leads are really good and memorable along with some great drumming to create some groovy death rhythms.  Just as surprising is the quality vocal work by Jeff Walker and a solid production.  Highly recommended, possibly the best metal album of 2013.
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|I've been watching Bates Motel recently (which has been better than I expected) and realised that I hadn't watched the source for a while. Psycho is a classic movie and for good reason. To modern eyes it might seem a little on the over dramatic side, but I love it and many modern film makers owe a debt to this film.<br /><br />For those of you that haven't seen it (in which case stop reading this and just grab it!) it tells the story of a young woman who impulsively steals $40,000 from her job. While on the run she stays at the Bates Motel, run by the ultimate mummy's boy - Norman Bates.<br /><br />Both of the leads perform an excellent job with their roles, Bates has a creepy feel to him that pervades every scene. In some ways it's a film of two halves and in fairness I do prefer the first half. The build up to her arrival at the motel works well and the scenes to the shower scene and aftermath are superb.<br /><br />The second half encapsulates the investigation and is still good, but doesn't shine as much as the first. The capture scene also stretches the over dramatic label a little and for me was Perkins' only bad scene. It's churlish of me to complain though, it remains an excellent watch and fully deserves it's classic status.
B00DOPEGAS|5.0|My daughter received this for her birthday and the band bracelet making has yet to stop.  As a matter of fact my 9 yr old girl got her 6 yr old brother to love this too.  So I had to buy another kit and they are simply addicted to watching video's on youtube of different designs and trying to make them on there own.  Great gift for 10's of hours of joy for your child!
0525478817|5.0|This book brought me to tears, it's a captivating story. I recommend this book to anyone who loves sad books. Also John Green is an amazing author, all his books grips you by the heart.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|dashboard dog says &quot;yes yes yes&quot;..and so did I when this was finally available for my kindle....<br />love it on the laptop the tablet and the phone....
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love it too much fun glad it came to my kindle now I can play all the time. thank you
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I was so happy when I was able to get this app for my Kindle. This is a very addicting game,  trying to catch up with my kids level. The game is thought provoking,  just when you almost get to the last object you realize you are out of moves. Love this game!
1400023343|4.0|My husband and I were very motivated to raise our child bilingually, but I don't think motivation is necessarily enough: Strategy is important too.  And this is what this book has given us.<br /><br />I like that the strategy from this book is research-based.  There are plenty of myths about raising a bilingual child, and this book helps dispel those myths.  There is also a lot of research covering what tactics are most beneficial in achieving a bilingual child.  Our son is still young (and I read this book just before he was born), so we have been using some of the strategies, and we will continue to use the book as he grows.  It's quite awesome that the author has made the research accessible to parents, so that parents can do their best in how to raise their child(ren) bilingually.<br /><br />I rather enjoyed reading about the various studies discussed in this book, but I can imagine that some readers might not want to read the details of different research studies.  But even if you don't want to read about the research, you can skim that part and use the handy summaries that are at the end of every chapter.  They are very to-the-point and offer specific tips you can use.<br /><br />There is also a section that summarizes cases of different families' bilingual situations.  It was not as useful to me as the rest of the book, but some people might identify with a particular case, which would be useful to them.  It did help me in understanding other models of bilingual families, which is useful for me when chatting with other parents of bilingual families.<br /><br />I hear from other parents that they are discouraged about raising a bilingual child or that they have given up.  I think this book is the answer.  In addition to the written part of the book, she also includes a resource section in the back, with organizations that parents can join for additional support in raising a bilingual child.
B0089LOG02|4.0|The author did her research and blended it in the story very well.  It is hard to believe the orphan trains really are a part of history.<br />The 'accidental' meeting was hard to believe, but that is why it is called fiction !!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I like this app and although I don't like the pop ups I have always accepted that they are part of a free app. I do however draw the line at a pop up porn website.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|I am a moderate internet radio listener. I realize I'm late to the game, but I'm ok with &#34;jumping on the bandwagon&#34; when I hear a new (old) artist with some catchy sounds. I had heard a couple songs from this album via one of my internet radio stations, but really zeroed in on the lyrics when I heard two Voice contestants sing Radioactive. I looked the artist up on spotify, sampled the album, and then purchased it. For me, the songs are fun. The album starts out edgy, then sprinkles in some pop sounding tracks, and some very catchy fun songs. I was pleasantly surprised. I sought out the album for Radioactive, recognized It's Time, and really enjoyed Demons, On Top Of The World, Amsterdam and Bleeding Out.  It's a great album that takes you in some different sounding directions, and it works. Sample the tracks and then get the whole album, you won't regret it.
B00B1D7ANK|5.0|This dragon and knight are SO detailed! Beautiful! The knight stays in the dragon saddle via magnet which I thought was cool.
0307010856|5.0|i love this book, as a kid I loved it, so I bought it here for my kids. They love when I read it because I really put everything into it, I think they secretly love that mum can act really silly sometimes. Even though they know the ending they still love the suspense.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Amazing graphics with stunning details. I usually don't get addicted to games like this, but  I have to say it's ' VERY ADDICTIVE
B0016LTNL4|1.0|Don't watch this movie. It's not funny and a waste of your time. Was told this was funny and I had to watch...
B006GWO5NE|1.0|The.micro plug on this cord did not last very long. Just this past week it broke with the shiny part of the micro plug being pushed inside of the plug so that it would no longer seat as it was supposed to. Because the plug is made of rubber I was unable to fix it. I tried holding the plug with a pair of players but this was to hit or miss.Aside from this the plug worked fine.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|ive watched this movie about 4 time now and it's as cool as the first (which i also have), cant wait to see what comes next
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is very good because it gives me a more detailed description of how long my battery life will last depending on what i am doing. And it tells me how long it takes to charge depending on what way I'm charging it
B008JFUO72|4.0|I've always been a fan of the Iron man movies, and this is one of the best, a lot of action and drama, I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves sci-fi.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Every song on this recording feels like it's headed to a destination. What I'm talking about is purpose. Every track features the rare ability to make one understand within the first 3 seconds that the musicians are speaking from their soul on all accounts.<br /><br />First, Zach dela Rocha's lyrics are bold and complete from start to finish. In former &#34;Rage&#34; releases...sparsely...but there...his lyrics sometimes had the feeling of an undiscovered visionary. They were never &#34;bad&#34; per say...but something about them felt incomplete although his intent and intensity commonly masked these minor blemishes. In this release...dela Rocha has completely erupted into his own. He takes chances. He also lays back like a true musician. He's found that fine line. He has completely arrived as an activist, a lyricist and an artist like all Rage fans knew he was out of the gate.<br /><br />Tom Morello. He is THE &#34;Generation X&#34;'s answer to Jimi Hendrix. He's down to earth in his delivery. He's out there in his statements. His sound is timeless. His sound is revolutionary. If you aren't amazed by this guitar players grasp on sound emphasis...we don't have anything to talk about. Anchoring his genius is his innate ability to rock the &#34;F&#34; out while hanging on F sharp which every guitar player worth their weight in salt knows. :)<br /><br />Brad Wilk is probably the most underrated drummer in rock. Wilk absolutely SLAYS the kit when he turns the band aggressive...and absolutely lays back when it's time for the song to shine. This man knows what GROOVE is all about. He is the backbone and skeleton of this masterful performance. Just like his bandmates...he knows when to lay back...and my GOD...when he steps up...watch out. If you don't groove to this recording...specifically because of the effort from Brad Wilk...in the words of David Letterman: &#34;You ain't hooked up right.&#34;<br /><br />Tim Cummerford: Timmy &#34;C&#34; has been Morello's counterpartin genius musicianship since the inception of Rage. Tim is the most complete bassist out there...period. He's never been given the credit he deserves. Between his rhythm choice...his note choices....his sound...but honestly... &#34;F&#34; all that noise....the bass sound is created first by the soul and second by the hands. Tim C IS the soul of Rage. Bet you never noticed in &#34;New Millennium Homes&#34; how he does a &#34;Call and Answer&#34; bass line to himself during the verse. Yeah...most people don't. BTW Tim C likes to play upright bass in his spare time. There's a lot more going on there than just pop rock definitions of this guy. Check into him. Genius.<br /><br />Lastly...the &#34;fifth&#34; members of the band...the producers and Engineers...Kevin Dean – Assistant Engineer<br />Nick DiDia – Engineer<br />Russ Fowler – Engineer<br />Kevin Lively – Assistant Engineer<br />Stephen Marcussen – Mastering<br />Brendan O'Brien – Producer, Mixing.<br /><br />Brenden O'Brien again shows his prowess as a musician and producer. Amazing ideas and direction. The recording itself is a masterpiece. Pay attention to the &#34;folk&#34; listed above. They are as genius as the bands playing. Unsung heros. Find out what they are doing and listen/watch it. :)
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|I've been a Star Trek fan since the TV series, and I really enjoy the new remakes, the quality and the special effects are so much better, and anything that JJ Abrams produces is going to be good, so if you're a Star Trek fan you won't be disappointed.

B008RA3X5E|5.0|very cool app. use it all the time!!! I like the sleep timer with my own music playing as I drift off to peacefull slumber!
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|This book was written by someone who never had do real ezperiments or tests.<br />Philosophy? Sure. Physics and proof of the physicial world being mallable to conciousness? No.<br /><br />Give it a one star because of bait and switch.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Such a sad ending but i can't think of a better one to this incredible Trilogy! I love these books.
B007XC9BSK|5.0|It is a good sturdy truck. It is a lot smaller than I thought it would be, but the cab and trailer snap together well, and stay together without breaking off a part. It is sturdy.
B0056CUZRA|5.0|Wish you knew more about the history of World War I, but find history books too dry? Read this book!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|As a reader who has kept the promise to &#34;never read King again&#34; after the DarkTower debacle, I decided to relent for Doctor Sleep. And I wasn't disappointed. The book was not a &#34;horror&#34; masterpiece, but it was a pleasant adventure story and a satisfying epilogue for Danny Torrance's life.
B009GEYX5E|5.0|i read all the negative reviewsand it kind of put me off, but i needed to buy film for my recently purchased polaroid camera.<br />i came to the conlcusion that with everything, it is always going to be a risk, so, i took a chance and purchased the film and im glad i did. in MY experience with it, (i've no idea how the pictures will turn out for you). i am obviously a newbie at this polaroid camera photography, but i've always wanted one. i will say this though, i snapped at random things as test shots, an i shouldntve because i see that the film did work. now im down to 5. but try it!!! it's really gooD! gives the pictures a vintage feel. love it. i will be buying again. you should too! ;)
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Powerful end to a powerful series. Shows how difficult a world is to change, and the people in it.  \\"Be brave.\\"
B00EVW0VTI|4.0|I watched this movie with my son who described the film as &#34;epic.&#34;  It is very high action and some killing of the bad guys, but there is not a lot of blood and guts.  This film is not proper for younger kids because of the violence, but my older ones really enjoyed it.  The plot is predictable, and this one will not win any awards, but it was still great fun to watch.  It was fast paced and not boring.  I would watch it again.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Very fun. It's a little logic game that doesn't require much time. Perfect for busy people. The little pictures are cute.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Love his literary style, characters and the ways he connects them. This is the kind of book I looked forward to reading! Hope he writes another one soon.
B009NX1YT6|4.0|This is a good movie to watch when your favorite high school team has a bye week.  This is one of my favorite movies and I am super excited that Amazon added it to the Prime list of movies.
B005BGBPBG|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. Very cute! I would recommend this movie. Not sure my husband would've liked it, but he was gone so it was a perfect movie for me on a Friday night!
B00338QENI|5.0|The book is definitely an educational page turner.  I recommend the book to anyone especially my students that plan on careers in health and human service field.
B008WCP2PG|1.0|movie sucks. story sucks. but lets be honest, we didn't watch or buy this movie for the story line .. we bought it for the dance moves and all the sexy guys in the movie.
B004S5C91Q|5.0|Intriguing, captivating and thought-provoking.  Donoghue highlights the humanity and humour in an otherwise grim scenario.  I devoured this book in one luxurious sitting.
B007FZ7R7W|5.0|CB did work on this thing .. at first i only liked a couple of songs and then i listened to the whole thing and was at awe with all of the songs. they are all pretty catchy in their own way. i'm glad i bought this cd.
0763621803|5.0|I won't say my kids are gobbling down vegetables after reading this book, but at least they are talking about eating things they think they don't like.  My son is much happier eating &#34;orange twiglets&#34; now.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|The whole book was placed with a great plot...until the end.  The usual author does not end a book this way.  I am not saying that veronica is not good.  More the opposite, it is just I hate how Tris dies.  Besides that, the book was incredible.  Goodbye Tris.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was an intriguing, quick casual read. It was a great rainy weekend choice. I am interested in the authors other works for more fun reading.
B00G32QIEG|3.0|I'm going to be honest I didn't think this movie was great. It was more silly then actually funny. I've always found movies that tried to turn death into something funny to be a lot less then funny. RIPD was no different. It was something to watch on a lazy day with nothing else to do, but it wasn't the movie I'd watch a second time too soon.
B0010SEN18|5.0|Another great book by Joe McNally .  Fun to read and educational at the same time. It is always great to learn from the best.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|There's something about coming home from a long work week and not wanting to use your head too much. Some popcorn, a bottle of wine, Bruce Willis, explosions, cheesy lines - are all a girl needs to feel relaxed.<br /><br />Awesome cast, easy to follow storyline and feel good times.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Great read lots of action & deception looking forward to next book what a series all great books keep getting more exciting.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I am very upset that I read this book. I agree with other readers to save yourself the time and write your own ending. I absolutely loved the first two books but this book was awful. The ending was horribly sad and unnecessary. The plot was boring and did not match the other two stories.  I will not be reading any more of Ms. Roth's books. I am no longer a fan.
6305692572|5.0|It's a Great movie. I showed it to my substance abuse and dependence group. They enjoyed as much as I did.
0345528581|5.0|Bought the book, very detailed and simple exercises. I haven't started using it yet because I am too lazy to commit to the programs. Going to work on my determination.
B004NOCCEG|5.0|I don't have a wireless router and don't want one ... so I can't register my blue ray player....and can't get this movie from Amazon<br />I bought a DVD from Barnes and Noble though....<br />Somehow, every person in the world should see this movie....<br />Our TV, newspapers, and radio and many web sites are owned and run by the same people robbing us....<br />so nobody knows what's going on...<br />This movie does a lot to correct our knowledge deficit.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Awesomeness.comes in handy when you have been in the same thing with the government to take advantage over the government.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I can't even say all I want to say because I don't want to spill anything. Just....wow. totally unexpected. Everything about this book was so different than I imagined it would be. It did not end how I would have preferred, but the conclusion to this story is what makes it so powerful.
1401917232|5.0|This is a life changing book that is worth reading multiple times to understand at a deeper level. If you have to read only 4 books in your life, that would be A Course in Miracles and the trilogy of books by Gary Renard including this one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game!  I've been waiting for this game to be available on my Kindle for a long time.

B003VIWO9I|3.0|I, like many many people, absolutely love Terry Pratchett and I've followed the Discworld series for decades.  The Tiffany Aching books are a particular pleasure, especially with the constant possibility of Granny Weatherwax turning up.  I adored 'The Wintersmith', it was one of my favourite books of the entire oeuvre...  beating it for intensity and depth is practically impossible.  Í Shall Wear Midnight' is a great read, a page turner with good characters and an enjoyable tour of the Discworld but, for me, it does not compare with Tiffany's preceding adventures.<br />So, for Pratchett fans, I heartily recommend this book but don't expect the superb heights of previous outings.<br />(Sorry, Terry!  I feel disloyal for my honesty but I'm sure you'll understand - you will always be a god of the written word and a consummate human being!)

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I can't say anything. It's an emotional roller coaster that mostly goes up (you'll get it when you read the book). It's amazing. It's the best book I've ever read. Thank you, John Green.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This is exactly what its supposed to be.  Well done.  Simple. Easy.  I'm going to stop writing this review now.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I loved the first novel of this series and was reasonably happy with the second. But the third just doesn't work. ***Spoilers in case there is anybody who doesn't already know the ending***<br /><br />Whether she intended to do so or not, the author raises certain expectations in her readers when she creates a strong romance plot. Likewise when she writes most of a series in the first person heroine's point of view -- i.e., you can't tell your story if you're dead. Switching to a dual POV in the final book is a giveaway that either Tris or Tobias isn't going to survive, but unfortunately the dual perspectives don't ring true, since the two voices are too similar.<br /><br />Killing the heroine/hero of any novel is a huge risk, and it really only works when the readers are expecting a tragic ending. In a series like this one, we expect triumph at the end, not to mention a happy resolution for the primary romance. But when the trilogy can be summed up with \\"your mom dies, your dad dies, your friends die, then you die\\" there's not much to celebrate or feel good about. The world sucks and then you die. I read books to escape that unhappy reality!
B000TU16GS|5.0|For anyone who enjoyed this book, I would recommend Breakaway by Anthony Shanley and Anna Shanley, which is also a great sit-on-edge story!  Stormbreaker is a really exciting spy thriller!  It's great for young audiences because the main spy is a fourteen year old.  I also love the weapons: ordinary objects with hidden functions--James Bond for a younger generation.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|This is a nice  program.<br />Great for keeping track of the weather around your home and around the places friends and family live.<br />It has good graphics - entertaining.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Book was great. So glad Mr. King decided to continue Danny's story. I have been a fan of Stephen King since Carrie was first published and have all of his books.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I held off on reading this series just because of pure stubbornness. I am so glad to have finally jumped on the band wagon. This book was filled with everything I like to read. I can see why people would not like this book but it was my cup of tea. I enjoyed the characters and even how the helicopter had a name.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|I always read this to my kids and now I read it to my granddaughter only this time around, it makes me cry as I guess I miss my mom.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a great book with love sex and suspense. I enjoyed the series and I am pleased with the way it all played out. I loved the epilogue as well as the POV from Fifty's point of view. Great series in my opinion.
068484267X|5.0|Perfect. (Again) sluties in my mind are hens in the farms, s*** everywhere, eggs for lunch, leaves for dinner. Ass
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book definitely turned up the suspense notch but I also enjoyed that it didn't completely overtake the storyline. I am also glad that after the big dramatic scene happened there was still so much more to continue reading rather than a rushed ending with a cliffhanger. I am digging Mr. & soon to be Mrs. Grey.
B007THA4FI|3.0|If you can read it through to the end there will be a reward for your efforts. On the other hand, there are so many great books out there why bother.

B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Could not wait to read this book, bought it Saturday and I admit I could not put it down. Loved all the old characters were back and basically doing well.that being said I did not think there were any surprises. You could tell where it was headed.That in itself was not a bad thing.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|First of all, let me say that a have much repect for Ms. Roth, however it is quite hard for me to grudge some up for this book. I loved the first took book incomprehensibly, and I devoured them each in about a day. Now, this book is just wow... in some ways, it's an amazing and in other ways a horrible one. Now, unlike everyone else, I'm not going to harp on the ending, while I'm not going to lie, I do despise it and hate it with a burning passion, I must begrudgingly admit that it was in a fitting ending. Although it was a rather wacked way of doing it the ending summed up all of Tris's views and the lessons expressed in the trilogy fairly well, even if it does leave all of our hearts aching. On the contrary, my main complaint is that when the POV switched, you had no way besides context clues and looking at the beginning of the chapter to figure out who was talking! That was extremely annoying... In addition, the random character developmnts and charachter gaps were simply bad and rather annoying. In general, I think that this book was rushed to production and that given time the kinks could be ironed out, making this an excellent book amd not another Mockingjay. Finally, I must commend Ms. Roth for making an enjoyable insanely popular book series that wasn't profane and overly sexual. Ms. Roth new that excessive profanity is just vulgar and the sex should be kept in the marriage. I feel that this is a lesson to all authors, that a book can be extremely popular without being vulgar and sexual. (Yes,I'm looking at you E.L. James [Fifty Shades of Gray]!)
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I  loved the twists and turns in this story.  It was hard to put it down each night!  I highly recommend the book.
006202406X|1.0|I don't read books, let alone trilogy's, to feel depressed at the end. If you haven't started this trilogy, I'd recommend reading Divergent and stopping there.  What were you thinking Veronica?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game, I could play for hours. I'm so glad you got it available for the Kindle fire now, Love it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy that candy crush is finally available on the kindle!  I am addicted!!!  Super fun...but beware...it will take over all of your free time.
B005651RDS|4.0|This was a very different story, the characters became so real and they had my emotions going from high to low, laughing and crying in a very short space of time, until there was a very tragic part to the story which made me wonder why I was reading it, but I persisted and was able to see the true strength of human nature.  This story is about making the best of what you have at the time and coming through adversity.<br /><br />I would recommend this because it is definately worth reading even though it was tragic.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|The first part took a while to get into as it was setting the scene but I enjoyed it, particularly as I was really starting to feel for Nick. The second part blew me away - and the ending was so cleverly frustrating. It created a great discussion in my book club.
B00EPL4PBK|5.0|Awesome album! Love the old school feel and the crisp drums. Great sound! Recommended for anyone that loves metal. A+
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I've heard a lot about this game, how addictive and Fun it is, prior to its becoming available on the KINDLE ; so needless to say I went ahead and downloaded it from Amazon as soon as I saw it.  MISTAKE<br />Oh, the graphics are great, it is fun but, there's no way to solve it without PAYING for &#34;candy crushers &#34; to help you get to the next level !!! ( And there's no guarantee you will make it )  Will be skipping this candy rush !!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I enjoyed this book. It makes you think about decisions you make and where they make you end up. Do things really happen for a reason? Is karma related to all of this? This was an enjoyable read of 3 different women's lives and how they grapple with where they are, how they got there and how it all makes sense in the end.
B00EMGUR60|5.0|I like Motorhead for two reasons. One; they're pretty f****** fast when they want to be. And I'm a speedfreak. I'm rather fond of their faster songs, especially the ones that just cut right to the chase. Rather than relying on technical prowess, (although, that's not to say they're not capable of doing that when they want to,) Lemmy and Co. take the direct approach; a no frills, no prisoners, and most importantly, no B.S. mindset of songwriting. Speed truly kills. Unless of course, you're Lemmy. Which you're not.<br /><br />The second reason is that these Bastards, (pun intended,) consistently put out great albums every 2 years or so. They're really good at putting out great, no nonsense rock 'n roll albums. If it's not great, at the VERY least, the album's just \\"pretty good\\", which, compared to 90% of the other metal/rock bands out there these day, equates to; \\"still more badass than anything you could come up with.\\"<br /><br />This album is no exception, and you should really buy it if you're a fan of speed metal or rock, an old time Motorhead fan, or even someone listening to Motorhead for the first time. Other than that, there's not much more to tell you, really. Other than to buy this album, and pretty much every album Motorhead's ever made. Like, ever.<br /><br />It's a Motorhead album; it's fast, it's mean, it's got a few interesting parts here and there to have some pacing, but for the most part, it's a no holds barred beatdown, start to finish. \\"Aftershock\\" will rip you a new one, and not even give you the common courtesy of replacing it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Played by the whole family across the country. From my 10 year old son to my mother who is a little older.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Hate being stuck on same level for a week or better though.  SHOULD be able to earn items to assist also.
B008PJ6GLU|5.0|Popshit dance funk funky the best way to get the job done in time to get it now and again.  The only problem is that the company is looking forward, but I think it was not able the best way to get it.
B00E5N8E2O|5.0|This was a great live CD!  The sound is amazing, the band sounds tight and melodic, better than ever!  This CD is a must have!  The DVD is an awesome show, you don't want to miss it!
B00DHQ208Y|5.0|I was all alone in this case the album was not the intended recipient of course I remember you saying something like that of a new York City and state of the art mind probe the results for you to know what you think are good
B000V6ADNW|5.0|Overall great buy, had good songs. Very we'll put together. I thought it was a good cd to listen too from beginning to end
B006BFK5DK|5.0|All I can say is I love, love, love this CD.  This band still inspires me.  I would purchase their music again and again.
1480506990|5.0|This is invaluable information and I'm glad they took the painstaking effort to research and put together. There is so much propaganda in our schooling - it's unfortunate we don't always get the other side or the factual side of the story. I always recommend checking facts on whatever you are being presented - even if it's someone you tend to agree with. If you liked the books &#34;Lies My History Teacher Told Me&#34; or &#34;Overthrow&#34;, you will most likely like this.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I don't have much to say except don't read this unless you want to do like a child. It was amazing and beautiful, but it's one of those stories I can only read once.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I had started this book in high school but then never finished it. For years I've wondered about the story, but couldn't remember the name or author. Recently I saw the movie trailer and recognized it. Definitely worth the wait. Looking forward to the movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My first thought it would be a little sad cause I love the game is nothing more about this page not what you're looking for a little sad cause I love the game is nothing more about this page not what you're looking for a little sad cause I love the game is nothing more than one of a lot of the stars of the game was not a lot but the stars and I know that we had to do grow up and I love this game was not what you can see that you guys are the stars and I love this page bookmark our own internet marketing and the stars of the stars and I love this page
B007BFSYMS|5.0|We use this app nightly to lull off to sleep! Right now my husband is in the hospital and it's running so he can rest and diffuse hospital noise..it's working great and even several nurses have asked about it!! It's our standby for traveling too! TY White Noise creators!
006202406X|2.0|Overall, the plot for the first two books was compelling and true to the various characters. This last book leaves a lot to be desired, especially when compared to the first two books. What a disappointment.
0694003611|5.0|i always buy this book to go into shower/baby gift packages. it was the fav of my children and they would always know if i tried to skip a page (after reading 3 or 4 times at bedtime, it sometimes became tiring!) as with amazon, the price was better than babies r us and delivery was fast!
B009V0TV6O|5.0|I love this app. It's helpful in figuring out how to write certain beats or how to play them from sheet music.
0920668372|5.0|love this book when my boys were growing up. always brings tears to my eyes 26 years later. so happy i could include it for a baby gift for a good friend. (i STILL have the book that i used with my boys!) and shopping amazon? always 5 stars!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad that it's finally on Kindle because now I can take it with me wherever I go go go go.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love that i can use it on my Kindle, phone, computer etc... Makes lists and quick notes so simple and retrievable.
B00DHHWXYY|4.0|Leonardo DiCaprio was captivation in his role as Gatsby.  The story is such a great classic, I remember seeing the Robert Redford. Mia Farrow version.  Also done well.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun, fun, fun. Very challenging and VERY addictive! I wake up and play and it's the last thing I'm doing before I go to sleep!
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like the home page.  not sure if the videos are necessary.  I would like a line item showing percentage of change of precipitation for the day and added to the hourly detail.
1612680011|4.0|I read this book (and many of the accompanying \\"Rich Dad\\" books) many years ago and although I was already practising the principles preached in the book, it was nevertheless good to go over them.<br /><br />For the principles presented, I'd give the book five stars, however I have to subtract one star for the whole fictional \\"rich dad, poor dad\\" setup, since it never existed the way Kiyosaki presented it in his book. The book has you believe, that he indeed had a \\"rich dad\\", whereas in fact no such single person existed and Kiyosaki has since confessed, that he made up his \\"rich dad\\" based on various people he knew in order to present the ideas in a more readable format. That is all fine and dandy but I still feel a bit duped having believed that the \\"rich dad\\" was indeed a real person. Other than that little bit of fantasy, I'd recommend this book to anyone wishing to get a new (or to reaffirm his existing) perspective on his or her personal finances.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so much and also if there was a 6 star rating I would rate it 6 stars.
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|I always enjoyed the first one. This one brings a few new styles of play. As good as the first.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Was a beautifully written novel.  Kept me guessing.  Shows how far we as parents are willing to go to protect our children.
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|The plot was a bit of a stretch, but i guess it's not about believability.  If you want action and great special effects, you will like this one.  For me it just wasn't very compelling.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|I for one enjoyed Pacific Rim a whole lot. It was great. I believe that too many people have been brainwashed into thinking that movies can only be about serious, dark, gritty, evil things that sap your emotional strength. However, I, being a logical and thinking human being know that you need to take breaks from the grim, dark, gritty, evil themes that seem to be all to much in so many movies. People need a break from that stuff to enjoy something fun, entertaining for a change. All you nay-sayers need to just save it and let people enjoy this great movie. There is too much darkness in movies now a days. The theater should have a healthy balance of darkness and light. Not just darkness all the time. All you nay-sayers need to also stop having a problem with people liking something that isnt dark and evil. Pacific Rim is worth many viewings, it is fun and exciting and keeps one on the edge of their seats. I really enjoyed it. And if there is a sequel, then please, God speed.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|It was better than I anticipated, I liked the story line. I'm not sure if I liked the back and forth between past and present but it all came together at the end.
B0094M30DE|5.0|I am a big fan of romantic comedies.  This one doesn't disappoint.  Really enjoyable to watch.  Alex O'Loughlin is great.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a solid game. there is plenty of difficulty levels. you can quickly get the hang of it and still be challenging yourself to get it perfect. the time trial feature is my favorote. challenge your friends to beat your time.
B005M5PER2|5.0|Great show with combination of wonderful actors, great action, drama, & comedy.  The cast has such a great chemistry between them especially McGarrett & Danno.  Not to mention the most beautiful scenery in the world.  The best show on TV is years.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Love it!<br />It gave the little bit from the shining his own story .. As well as an ending. Great
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I was not disappointed in this book like alot of people because of the ending. Yes, I would have liked to see a happier ending but it also wasn't a complete surprise to me either.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King fans will love this one.  I was intrigued that this was a follow up to King's iconic novel The Shining.  It didn't disappoint.  The characters had depth and humanity.  I read it in just a few days and was sad when I came to the last page.  I sort of hope this is the start of a new trend for King - novels that continue a story from a previous classic.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Cool moive, not your average movie about aliens trying to take over the world. Will definitely watch again when I have time
B000VSAEYI|4.0|Great pool for toddlers! Just enough water to have fun in, but not too deep. The only drawback is it is very hard to drain all the water. It does have drain plugs but they do not drain much water. It is so big that it is very hard to empty. Aside from that, the little ones loved this pool. The slide was a hit!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Kinder than The Shining, but very true to it at the same time.  I enjoyed this one a lot.  Keep coming back SK; and I will too.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|The graphics are great. I'm so addicted to this game, there's so much more to do then the old version the only reason why I give it a four is because you have limited energy so you can't play as much as you want to until it refills back up
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|Didn't know that people have different love languages. Now I have found my wive's and my own love language. Very informative and enlightening book.
B00E8B1358|1.0|This move was just awful , The plot was ridicules the dialogue was even worse. Don't wast your money. SKIP THIS ONE!
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Excellent movie - filmed onstage - so just like seeing it in the theatre.<br />This Phantom junkie loved the movie & have purchased several as gifts
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I couldn't figure this one out!  I did not see the ending developing at all. I was hooked from the first page and you will be too.
1476727651|3.0|Being a Stephen King fan, I decided to buy this book. But upon learning that it is a sequel to \\"The Shining\\", I decided to read the book \\"The Shining.\\" I thought this might be a prudent thing to do since all I've ever seen is the movie; and had never read the book before. At present, I'm almost halfway through the shining. Once I finish that, I'll immediately start reading doctor sleep. Once I finish that, I'll do another review directed more toward the book. For right now, this here is the best I can do. But given who Stephen King is and how popular and good he is at his craft, I decided to give three stars for now. Until such time as I can accurately rate his newest book \\"Doctor Sleep.\\" Please be patient with me. I'm only trying to do what is fair as far as ratings go. Thank you.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Robert Cockerham
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I am not really sure about this last installment. I hate to do it....but it reminds me of the third book in the  Hunger Games series. I really despised that book until the end...and well this one was like that. I don't really care that it didn't end like most people would have  wanted. That doesn't bother me...it's that this book was very boring. And I only continued reading it because  I loved the first two so much. I feel like the series is sort of tarnished. Like  it could have been so good....and now....Well....it just isn't. It's over and  I am not very happy about how it ended. I wanted so much more from it. I'm rambling....because I am disappointed. I don't think I will read any of the short stories coming out now...it just won't have the same meaning to me. Feeling sad.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I have been a Black Sabbath/Ozzy Osbourne fan since I was 13 years old. The one thing that I've notice over the years, is that Ozzy Osbourne get better and better with each he puts out. Whether it be on his own, or with Black Sabbath. I'm a big fan of Heavy Metal music, and Black Sabbath 13 contains all the raw power and energy that I grew up with as a kid with Ozzy/Sabbath albums. After all these years, Ozzy and the entire Sabbath members haven't slowed down one iota. I love this album and could listen to it all day long! With that in mind, I rate this album a Metal grinding 5 stars!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Robert Cockerham
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|i only subscribed to cable so that i could watch this show. now that ive found this, bye bye timewarner! Excellent video quality
1551525143|5.0|Buy. The. Hard. Copy. You're going to want this for your bookshelf, and as others have said the Kindle version is wonky.<br /><br />I don't write reviews for my purchases often, but I had to make an exception for this one. Far too short of a story, but every panel is just masterful - you'll be hanging on to every word and carefully-drawn gesture by the first couple pages. Julie Maroh takes you on an emotional, heart-rending journey like no other graphic novel I've read ever has, and when you close the cover you'll be wondering when it was exactly that you got sucker-punched in the gut. This book brought emotions - both painful and wonderful - to the surface for me that I haven't felt in years, and for that I'm both astounded and eternally grateful to the author. Regardless of how you identify yourself, you will feel this story in your bones.<br /><br />I already know the new movie won't live up to the book (because when do they ever, really?), but it's reassuring to know that Maroh's work is getting proper respect and recognition internationally. Outstanding.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|I liked<br /> the book, but I thought it was a little repetitive. However I would recommend it to a friend.
B00BB67UNW|1.0|Just not a well-made movie. Poor cinematography. Wahlberg doesn't want to be there. Crowe's hair looks painted on. Zeta-Jones acts like she's stoned on something. And the liberal bias is totally in your face. The mayoral-candidate is named \\"Valiant\\" and he's gay and he wants to tax everyone making over $200k. He's good and pure, while Crowe (hetero, part of the establishment) is evil. And the film being a modern \\"film-noir\\" masterpiece? Gimme a break. Films with poor production values are often labeled film noir, to disguise their low budgets and lazy cinematography.  A total mess of a movie. Avoid it at all costs.
B00CL50KDY|4.0|Liked the movie very much, and wasn't the least bit squeamish about letting the kids watch. We all enjoyed it!
B009VIZDLI|5.0|very witty, funny, and a great read. A great insight into the Asperger frame of mind as well as the other characters and their quirks
B003B02PF4|3.0|The book is very well written, the characters are believable and I could identify with them.  I didn't find this book as enjoyable as some others of Mr. Grisham, but that doesn't make it bad.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an extremely entertaining game! I only wish there was a riding freeplay mode. Other than that, it's really fun!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Im so happy that candy crush is finally on the kindle and that my progress on fb wasn't lost. This game is addictive and great for people to play whenever they have extra time on their hands.
B0017TFLBQ|5.0|This isn't the game of choice for your typical female, but I absolutely adored this game as a child. My brothers played it, so I played it. We got a new computer and for whatever reason I stopped playing Heroes. Years and years and years later I found my old CD. Overjoyed, I put it in my laptop only to discover it was far too damaged to ever work. So I of course promptly ordered new discs. The game is just as fun if not more fun that it was when I was a kid. It's insanely addictive with no real reason why. I guess I'll just have to deal with being made fun of for playing 'that nerdy dragon game' all the time.
B000XUBC5E|5.0|Love this book! I never saw it coming' lots of surprises and I loved every minute! Can't wait to read another by Coven.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush is like an addiction. It is very hard to stop playing once you get started.  Very challenging the further you get.You
B000YDG5X4|4.0|I guess size 9/5 should fit perfect!but I loved the boots! The color is so nice also the designer either!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addicting. Love this game, very challenging and frustrating at the same time. If you try it you will love it
0446547638|5.0|One of the best by Sparks.  Had all the ingredients of a page turner, superb character portrayal, and an ending so beautifully executed.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|So excited about downloading this app!<br /><br />Thank you, thank you!<br /><br />Don't hesitate to download this app. . you won't regret it.
0375851569|5.0|If you lived on an island and didn't know who Dr. Suess was, you might not initially be overly impressed by his books.  The illustrations, while entertaining, are not overly detailed, nor do they demonstrate amazing artistic ability.  The text is not overly educational and is sometimes nonsensical.  But there is something almost ineffable about Dr. Suess that makes his books classics and sets them apart from other children's books.  The rhyming is almost hypnotic and draws my grandchildren in right away.  They want to read along with the book, so while the text itself may not be too educational, it really helps kids learn to read.  And the stories and characters are very memorable the characters almost come alive in the books.  I don't think it is important to also have other books that are more educational, as these books are more for entertainment.
006202406X|1.0|Can you say SELL OUT!! Wow, if you have nothing to say/write...then please don't.  This book was super repetitive of the last book. Please do not waste your time reading this book. Trust me, it was purely written for money! She has no new story to tell...no new plot to develop. A real let down for sure!!
0064431789|5.0|Maurice Sendak is rightfully considered a legendary author and illustrator of children's books.  His illustrations are stunning and packed with detail, something that is sorely missing in many books today.  This books make for a fascinating read and my grandkids enjoy it.  Sendak does have a dark sense of humor at times, so if you want to only expose your kids to warm, cuddly, cute animals and happy stories, this book may not be for you.  But there's a good underlying moral in the story, so I personally don't think this is any reason to avoid it.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Most of the songs have the typical Bruno Mars beat and I love his sound along with his background people.  I find it great to work by.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the best app out there if you love to play games. It keeps your interest and is very addicting. Play the levels without buting any lives, what a rush when you finally get it.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I liked the book and loved the series.  There were some things off with the book (not the greatest explanations of things that had happened, or satisfying enough ones) and the pace was slow at times, however I think the end was a very good end to this series.  It did make me sad and wishful for a happier end, however the end itself fit the series really well and i still love the series. It could have gone other ways as people like to point out in reviews, but whatever, that isn't want happened and from what did happen it works- it closed the entire series and didn't leave lots of unopened items.
B00340LM8C|5.0|To Catch a Thief is just a fun movie to watch time after time! One can scarcely grow tired of Grants masterful performance of a reformed thief out to defend his now honesty status.
0345803507|5.0|What can I say that others haven't said . This is a must hands down !!! I read the whole series and lets see how they can make this movie.
006202406X|3.0|I think everyone is giving far too few stars for this book simply based on the ending.  i won't spoil it like everyone else on here seems to be doing :P in case you didn't read it in the first two days.<br />I thought it was very similar to the first two books, which I gave four stars.  The reason for the lower star on this book was mostly for the POV changing each chapter.  If you listen to it on audible, it was actually much better because the girl and boy voice switch as the Tris/Tobias POV switch.  But when I finished it on my kindle, I constantly had to go back and say \\"who am I right now?\\" cause 2 pages into the chapter I forgot which POV I was in.  Very confusing. Even just left justifying and bolding the name instead of blending it into the chapter # would have been better.<br />Though I'm not sure that would have helped  because the tones and the descriptions (like commenting on other people and their actions) were so similar, you really couldn't tell which head you were in.<br />I liked the idea of getting Tobias' POV, I just wish it had been done better...<br /><br />The book was slow to start with but it kept me entertained the rest of the way. The pace was pretty good, the different \\"cities\\" and the plot there was fine but there was enough for a fourth book if Ms. Roth would have been given the time to do it.<br /><br />Although I felt like Tris became a better person, I felt like Tobias became weaker and weaker as the books went on, which was sad for me. I adored the strong Four leader he was.<br /><br />The ending wasn't great but it wasn't as terrible as others seem to think.  It was realistic and one of the better written sections. I like amazon reviewer [ loladirga ]'s idea for an ending better though.  If you want the spoilers, go read her great review and imagine that ending instead. :)
0345803493|5.0|Like the other books, this is a must . I agree with every one who loved this book. cant wait for the movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing with this in my fire and even show where I was on my phone so I did n't have to go and do the whole thing again
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|We are reading this book in our church as a book study.  Everyone loves it.  It is simple, easy to read, and truly and inspiring, insighbul work of literature.  I'd highly recommend it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this is the BEST game Ive EVER played.great graphics and its very addicting. this is a must have I reccomend this 2 everybody
B003O86FMW|5.0|Whoa the end shocked me so much. I can't wait to read the next book. I also can't wait to see the movie!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very developed and likable characters and interlocking stories.  A little slice of imperfect lives and how one moment can change so many lives.  I would highly recommend this book
B0098460O4|4.0|I love listening to this music cd very much. Expecting theres is a second one in the near future.<br />If Jonathan can have a solo cd it would be a nice try.
B004LWZW42|5.0|I chose 5 stars becouse the movie is wonderful.<br />They are finally adding to this series.<br />I would recommed this to anyone.
B00E72OKAS|5.0|I got this for my son after I read the reviews, he's 11yrs old and I felt it was age appropriate for him. It's his absolute favorite game right now.I've watched him play it and it is pretty cool (; it's definitely one of the best zombie vs vehicle games. He loves the fact you can add really cool stuff to your many different vehicles. Totally recommend it. (;
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I chose 5 stars because this movie is wonderful.<br />They finally put it on d.v.d.<br />I recommed this to anybody.
B0001HAISG|5.0|Great movie, holds true to the story of my childhood. Fun for kinds and adults. Get it you will enjoy.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Not the most thrilling game, but not a bad way to pass the time. If you're patient and not expecting to play for hours straight, then a good game and no need to spend real money.
B00F1RR3Y8|5.0|THIS APP HAS EVERYTHING I EXPECTED...I CAN DESIGN MY OWN THINGS AND MY MOM LOVES IT AND MY OTHER FAMILE MEMBERS
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game been playing since it came out. lots of fun and challenging. would recommend it to anyone.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|But limited to how far you can go in the basic version. There are still some people without a Facebook acct.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|Really love this new album and this is the proof that they are still one of the best metal bands in the world. This is going to be an epic.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great app you will have a lot of fun especially if you are into hunting. Really good graphics and the weapons are awesome. A+ a+ a+ app
B00A17C316|5.0|I haven't listened yet==but based on the song list this is an awesome collection--I didn't have to listen--as I read the song list I could hear her singing it---c kalupson
B002RRWWQ4|4.0|No better, no less than previous ones. Why is every scene at nite, indoors and otherwise low light? It's not a mood generator, forces the viewer to squint.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Got it for the kids, but I play it more! Can't put it down. Once you get the hang of it you'll be addicted too.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love this game and I am thrilled to be able to play on my kindle - better than sitting at the computer.
B004FOA84A|5.0|This is a true point and click game, NO HIDDEN OBJECTS, YEA! Find OBJECTS and figure out where and how to use them.  This game is not overpriced for the fun you will have. For those deducting stars due to length of game, maybe you should go to a 2 hour movie and see how much entertainment you get for the money. THIS IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Between Castle's books and Rook's character in the TV series I am set for the Winter!!!!!!!! A well done series with a main female character with a sexy helper without a putdown. Just enough comedy to lighten the police violence.  Just right for me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really love this app. The graphics or awesome and so life like I enjoy this app each day mainly to whine down and clear my head from a long day of work. This apps is really a must have download and see for yourself. You want regret it.
B00ESY77LO|1.0|was expecting an updated version of the 1974 movie.  this was a tacky musical using almost the exact same dialogue.  did not even get through half of it.  bizarre!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Just so much fun.  Can be a challenge - can be nerve racking.  Still get more fun playing and accepting the challenge
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Nice to go back in time to watch movies from the first series of Star Trek.  Money well spent.  The print is amazingly good and so is the sound quality.
B003INBNXO|5.0|Absolutely one of the top martial arts films. Though it is a work of fiction it is a well made period piece with plenty of action.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|it was fun for awhile. even though you had to wait 20 minutes to continue.  but when you get to level 30 there is no way you can get past without buying things. so it really is not a free game. I will stick with angry birds
B00DJZR4A2|3.0|I recommend listening to the entire album for a fair assessment. Unfortunately the melodies just don't cling to the memory like the old<br />outrageously costumed chanteur!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|this has been very invaluable in keeping my kindle fire clean thereby freeing up space for more books and apps.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|My son loves this game, and the only criticism is that we have to limit his time with it or he would not put it down.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|Lots of bling and certainly better done than the Robert Redford version back in the day.  The pacing was better but I guess I just don't really want to get into the empty lives portrayed, even though the book was a commentary on exactly that.
B00ELU7A4E|4.0|My Grand daughter loves this CD.  She is a big Katy Perry fan.  This was her favorite Birthday gift.  Quite happy with this purchase.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|First, the disclaimer: I don't not like to read/watch/engage with the horror genre in any of its incarnations.  So, being that I actually sat through this zombie movie is saying a lot.  The only others I've managed to sit through were &#34;Shawn of the Dead&#34; and &#34;Fido&#34; and they were comedies.  The pacing was a little fast for my taste and I kept trying to figure out why finding patient zero was such a big deal.  I also didn't get what happened to Dr. Fassbach, unless they just needed to dump him to make Pitt's job even harder.  That being said, I like that it didn't end with a cure, or the end of the plague, but with a step.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a fun game that gets more challenging as you reach higher levels. Like most match 3 games, it's a great way to relax.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love it.  I haven't gotten very far yet, only level 12, but, it is challenging and fun.  My daughters and several friends play it on their phones.  I was just now able to get it on my kindle fire.
0887307280|5.0|Taught me why businesses don't work and how to make them do just that. By being the CEO and not the technician is what is most important.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Not an easy game to develop strategies in.  Just when I think I've figured out a strategy...I haven't.  Idk but I will keep playing.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|love it but at one point i had to restart the whole thing but i was only level seven now im doing better i highly recomend this
B003G4W49C|5.0|Yet in the process we chip away at our own humanity by relying on the deception of our innocent to commit genocide with hurried justification. Can we be forgiven?
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love playing candy crush saga, it's a lot of fun almost addicted to it. Will not paid money to play
0345803507|5.0|Fifty Shades was very educational for me, I enjoyed all three books! Well written! By E.L. James<br /><br />Thanks for asking!<br />P.L. Mckenzie
1878424319|3.0|I brought four books, myself and brothers and sister. They enjoyed the book  so did IHappy Halloween to you all.
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|Extremely hokey, watchable, but only barely. Title should have been \\"Will Smith does Will Smith\\". If the monster could be killed by a sword, why didn't they just shoot it?
B0089XH38M|4.0|Does the trick. However, a couple of glitches when it comes to updating and isolating treats. Will continue to explore to get this resolved.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|It was a good, much anticipated novel.  I think King has started clicking on all cylinders - especially after 11/22/63.  I will admit, the ending left me wanting for more - without giving anything away - things just happen too smoothly - and defy logic, in many cases.  Overall, however, I enjoyed it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was hooked by the first page. I have read and re-read the series 3 times. I want my own Christian Grey........<br />:)
B003N5VOUO|5.0|As an fan of SRK and Kajol, I really enjoyed this movie. This DVD in particular is from Fox Searchlight, so you know its a quality DVD from america, not pirated or a regionally locked DVD. Anyways, the movie is to die for, a simple, yet powerful love story, if you were expecting anything different from these two actors then you need to have brain surgery,. I strongly recommend that you check it out, as it is a great international piece, for any non Indian Bollywood fans. The beauty is that you have powerhouses of India coming together after a fair 9 year hiatus, K3G being their last one together. And even after that they've missed not a beat, and arguably the best of their careers. I can't invite you to come... fall in love, but i can say you can come writhe, cry, and witness a truly universal message told through the eyes of a man held down by society, and motivated by love for his dearest Mandira...
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|This one, I wasn't crazy about. Probably won't buy another one by this author unless it sounds like one I can't resist. I try never to say &#34;Never.&#34;
B005I3PAUO|5.0|A really good story which keeps you turning the pages. Looking forward to this character appearing again very soon. Reacher you have competition.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|So fun on phone but so much easier on kindle bigger  with keys and I'm better able to see board. Very happy now!  Thanks for the up date.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is a futuristic tale packed with references to 80's pop- and geek-culture.  It was simply a blast to read.  I'd give it 6 stars if I could.  I especially think any American male born between 1969 and 1974 would enjoy it.
B00FWPWNKS|1.0|App doesn't work, installed and only part that worked were the instructions. All games and all levels are blank. Tried several different times and NOTHING!
B009NY43NY|3.0|There are many complaints, timelines, the story ending, Charlaine Harris wanted to quit writing Sookie stories, but it was still a good tale.<br /><br />I wanted a different ending, but this seems appropriate for a sun-loving telepath. It was a good quick read and I'm glad I made it through the series.
B00G32PQNA|1.0|If you want to watch a movie that is nothing but two hours of boring conversation between two people, this movie is for you.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. I almost cried twice. I appreciate how the dad continued to try to care for the family in spite of the world caving in around them. I didn't think it was going to be very good, but I liked it
B00FRQ32N4|3.0|k so I did not play it yet. but I have a HARD time. installing. it... the comments seem like its fun.
B002BWP49C|5.0|And the love story continues! I have the first three movies and I can't wait for the final Breaking Dawn!
B009V0TV6O|5.0|It said free in the title when downloading, but that must be a glitch as it appears to be the full version-it works great, is totally customizable and has some presets to explore too. I will be using it as a tool for my son with special needs. The steady beat keeps him on task during homework and is calming when he is overexcited. Glad to have this!
B00EQF0JJC|3.0|This adaptation of \\"Much Ado\\" just didn't do it for me.  It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great either.  The actors didn't get the timing of the dialog correct.  Also, I thought filming it in black and white was sort of weird.  I think Joss W. would have done better to update the dialog into more modern English to go with his more modern costumes and set - and then filmed the piece in color.  The Bard's stories are timeless, but, and this is a huge but, it takes truly gifted actors to pull off the original dialog.  Timing is everything with Shakespeare, and as the Brits say, it must be \\"spot on\\".  This cast just didn't have it.  They memorized the wording beautifully, but the feeling and the timing just weren't there.  They gave a good attempt, but it fizzled instead of sizzled.
B002AWX6UM|5.0|This book was amazing, but secondary not for people who can't handle a sad story. This totally brought my attention to the issue of children being forced to participate in war.
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|Best yet! Love the G5 games and will be looking for more like this one. It's hard to put them down and get any work done!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|One of the best games I have ever played, I would get this game, and if you don't like it it's free so it won't matter if you delete it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is cool because it is so many games! I enjoy playing it in my free time! Some of the games are extreamly difficult, but most are fun!
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|The series has not been able to sustain the same level of 'new and interesting' as it did in Season one and two, but it's still watchable and has moments of greatness. Hopeful that it will hit another peak this season and be better than season 3 which I found somewhat disappointing.
B003Y74AZ2|3.0|Works OK. Does not really hug the case well and feels a little sloppy in the hand. I would not buy another one.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Many challenging levels and keeps your attention! Waited a long time for this game to come to kindle but so glad it did.
B00009NHC5|5.0|Many of us like seeing movies where there is an outside danger, but we always hate how stupid the victims are (&#34;I TOLD you not to go in there!&#34;). However, the plot in this movie erases much of that by having the lead character blind. In fact, the lack of full sensory perception makes us in awe of Hepburn's character. I show this movie in a film class when discussing horror and suspense, and my students love it (even though it's &#34;old&#34;). Although they find Hepburn to be a bit overly dramatic at times, they like her spunk. Also, the idea of &#34;good&#34; guy and &#34;bad&#34; guy are very successfully stretched so that my students didn't always like the guys they &#34;should have.&#34; They say that they like one of the main criminals (understandably), HATE the husband (I'd agree with them), and both admire and despise Alan Arkin's character (whom I believe Marlon Brando might have observed before creating Don Corleone?). All in all, I think that people like that this movie makes them both think and feel, but not in the ways in which they have been programmed.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I love this game! Amazing views, tough hunts and breast graphics. Problem is that I can't get passed the third level on my Kindle Fire!!! My friends with android phones have a fourth level they can pay, but I don't. It's really frustrating!!!! This needs to be fixed!!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is one of my favorite games and I'm thrilled that it's finally on Amazon.  It is very fun and addictive.  My whole family is playing on different devices.  It works great on my Kindle Fire HD.  Once you start playing this one it's hard to stop!  Fun, fun, fun!
B003WUYRGI|1.0|It didn't show or teach me anything. It blows and I wouldn't recommend it to anybody. Maybe I can find something different that will help and be better.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was bummed, I'd do my Facebook on my Kindles, but had to use my phone or laptop to play this..my favorite game. Then it said &quot;for Kindle&quot;. I was overjoyed. No more dragging the laptop to hospitals or other appointments.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|a fun app to play if you want to feel smart and pass the time. cute emojis. pretty simple but not so much that its dull.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I chose the five star rating because this book was one of the few recent books I've read that made me cry.<br />I liked the story and how it was told...very unusual. Also, it showed a different view of Germany during WW II.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Still trying to figure out the lesson this book taught. I loved the first two books and read them multiple times. Before reading this final installment, I couldn't wait to share the Divergent trilogy with my daughters because they are both ADHD and gifted. I thought reading about an amazing girl with an exceptional brain would be inspiring. After finishing this book, I no longer feel that way. The only characters who get to live their lives out in peace are the most selfish and flawed. Others left are left in such sadness and loss that there is no relief in their survival. Not that I needed a happily ever after with rainbows and butterflies, but not this. It needed to be more than this.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Enjoyed another book in the Circle series--compelled to get the next book to see what happens.  I am usually not a sci fi fan but got hooked on Black and now it is necessary to continue reading the series to get the whole picture and see how Bruce Willis finally pulls his two realities together.
B00969GFFU|5.0|I think you are either going to really get into this book right away like I did or not. There is no way this book deserves less than 4 stars though. A person who says a book is too boring to read should be immediately discounted as too boring to have an opinion. I hesitated buying this book for months because somehow people brought the average rating of this wonderful book down to three stars. There is no point in giving a synopsis of the book. It's a wild ride you either want to take or not. I have not enjoyed a book this much in years. After reading it I immediately bought The Corrections. Also a book with 3 stars, this is a 5 star book as well.
B000I9VZJ8|5.0|Such a great movie - awkward, funny, touching - completely appropriate for the whole family.<br /><br />We've watched it several times.
1616614609|4.0|The game is awesome, incredibly fun to play, specially if you are a SciFi fan (more so if you enjoy the Cyberpunk sub-genre). The atmosphere is simply perfect and makes me feel like I'm on a William Gibson's novel. Gone is the randomness of booster packs, or exorbitant prices for that last rare you are chasing after. Coming from a Magic: The Gathering background, that was a huge plus for me as I was looking to get into card games again, but with wife and children now, can't really put up with the barrage of new cards that flood the Magic world every few months (more specifically, the financial aspect of keeping decks up-to-date for Friday night matches against friends or unknowns in card game stores).<br /><br />Another huge plus is the fact that one Core Set is enough for 2 players to enjoy the game for a while. There are enough variety for at least 24 unique matches, not even considering deck customization. That's quite a lot considering you would barely have a single badly done deck of most (if not all) traditional CCG (a bit of unfair comparison, given Netrunner is a LCG).<br /><br />My only negative feedback about this game, is not even about the game itself, it's about the Core Set specifically. It does not contain 3 copies of each card. The are quite a lot of cards with 2 copies of each (more than half) and 11 cards with a single copy of each. Firstly, I would love this information to be more explicitly stated in the box or the publisher's site (there is a single mention about unique cards, the Identity ones, which doesn't really matter).<br /><br />If you have any background in other card games, you know that deck building is perhaps one of the most engaging aspects of this type of game. That's precisely where having the max allowed number of cards permitted becomes significant. The missing cards (either missing one or two) happens to be, unsurprisingly, some of the most powerful (specially some of the cards that you only get one copy).<br /><br />While a second set isn't absurdly expensive, again, compared to traditional card games, the fact that you have no alternative other than getting an entire core set is just a bit stupid (if anything else, for the waste of resources involved). At the bare minimum, a complementary set with just the missing singles/doubles would be nice (and slightly more friendly to the environment and the space in my house). Unfortunately, your only option is a full core set.<br /><br />If you are looking to have 3 of the \\"rare\\" (or single cards), then prepare to bite the bullet and get three core sets. Granted this won't be an issue to every player, it's still a sad aspect. It wouldn't be so bad if there were at least a reasonable alternative other than buying multiple copies of the core set.<br /><br />Thankfully, this only affects the Core set so far, as all the other expansions, including the deluxe one have 3 copies of each card included.<br /><br />Having said all that, it's worth every cent of the buy and it's a must for any fan of the genres involved.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This book is ok. It wasn't my cup of tea. It is about a girl and guy meeting in vegas and get married the same night. The girl was black out drunk so doesn't remember anything. They had made this arrangement to get married and have kids but never fall in love. Impossible, well she fall in love. He gets scared and you know what happens at the end. Well it was well written and generally a good story, it just isn't my type of story.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i play on the computer and it is a gr88888888888888888  game,keeps me interested and I cant seem to stop playing .
B00FOWX6NM|5.0|Most poeple complain about the easily scratched back but theyre not listning. When you get the case you must remove the plastic covers on front and back side of the case. It's there so it doesnt get scratched in shipment. It is crystal clear vision. Once i placed the order it took little to no time to ship. VERY fast. And for a bargan at only $10.99. Also you can ad you own pictures to this case so its a one of a kind! If your trying to decide if you want to buy this or not. I highly recomend it. Two thumbs up!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome game. Play it at work all the time (don't worry it's okay).....it's either that , watch t.v. or read.
0062024329|1.0|I downloaded this book and loved it, and wanted to purchase<br />the  book to give as gifts. Unfortunately<br />&#34;A Graphic Novel&#34; was not explained well.  This is a comic book<br />I returned it 3 weeks ago AND NEVER GOT A REFUND!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|So far really enjoyable. A little slow sometimes. I'll edit if anything changes but it seems to be a game that I'll keep
0553801473|5.0|It's the latest in the series.  You have to read the others first.  Don't fall in love with any of the characters - you have been warned!!!
B00DICGK24|5.0|This is an excellent family movie based on a real life situation.  I highly recommend this movie to all ages
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is a must read. It was awesome from beginning to end!! Loved how everything was interwoven. You won't be disappointed.
B0094K1WZE|3.0|OK. I like Jeremy Renner. But there were parts if the movie that felt like a stunt show, like the opening scene where the blond IMF Agent gets killed, and several parts where the movie gets silly, like the gala in Indis where the IMF agent is seducing the millionaire playboy.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|This was a page turner for me! I was particularly impressed with the almost lyrical nature of the writing. The author made us care about his characters.<br />Yes,this is sci-fi,but it's also a book about the horrors of war, the single mindedness of the people that are serving in the armies and how little we value human life.<br />It is similar to Starship troopers but that is not necessarily bad. A great read.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I have been watching the Sons since it was first shown and never miss an episode. I just watched season one again with Amazon Prime, on which, all first 5 seasons are free.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|its a fun game for everyone in the family, My kids and I love it plus using Facebook I play with all my friends
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I have been waiting for Candy Crush to be available on Kindle Fire! I am enjoying playing it on my Kindle!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|What a great way to keep in touch with family and friend. play interactive games with friend and family, and lets not forget you can use it to find old friends too.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and am looking forward to reading the next in the series. I've had this one on my to read list for a very long time. Glad I finally got to it. Now that I have I wish I would have read it sooner.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Really informative and enjoyable quick read about an amazing man. This is not an in depth biography but a nice surface look into a fascinating man and life. Worthwhile.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I liked the writing style of this author, but I must say that the never ending roller coaster of this book proved somewhat stress inducing. I definitely had mixed emotions given the incessant arguing, irrational thoughts, actions and total co-dependency of the main characters. Good book overall, but not what I had originally expected with all of the five star ratings.
B00EJB44VW|5.0|Very well written, approachable history, interesting ideas. Have much more respect for Jesus post read. References were a bit hard to follow.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|So glad that the director has stayed as close to the story as he could. The visuals are fantastic, and the story, as always, wonderful.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE THIRD IN THE SERIES TO .OUT MY NIECE, A SCHOOL TEACHER, EVEN A SIGNED IT TO HER STUDENTS TO READ.
B00E9ZFIMM|3.0|It was free, I had no idea what it was about and I still don't.  It seems to work fine, but there are no instructions to tell you what it's for or how to operate it.
B000SL1Q2W|5.0|I used to watch this movie as a kid.  My husband has never seen it so I ordered it so he could.  He was unimpressed but I loved it!
006202406X|5.0|Fantastic book  ... kept me turning the pages till I finished it .  I have read the complete trilogy & each one was better than the last.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Nice puzzle pack.  Relaxing way to wind down.  Good for your brain too!  Several ways to do the puzzles from easy to complex.
B0010T0JBA|2.0|First off I have to say they are very comfortable and easy to care for which is why I decided to switch from my usual Shoes for Crews Ollies to the all plastic Crocs. On my first shift in these I noticed a HUGE difference in the \\"non-slip\\". I had to be very cautious or else I'd slip in the kitchen, something I didn't have to think twice about in my SFC shoes.<br />With that said, I have worn these crocs for 40 shifts (yes, i counted) and the 'non-slip' rubber has peeled away from both shoes. Not only is it annoying to hear the flap-flap of the non-slip and trip on the ill-attached plastic, but a major disappointment in quality work shoes. I asked my other co-workers with the same crocs if they've had the same problem and the answer is YES, and all within 3-6 months. I expect more out of my work shoes, and so should you.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Awesome game in general I have played it on the computer for years, but on the pocket addition u need to make it so there are commands, along with usable  redstone, and enchantments.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|I am listening to the books on my phone and love see the character come to live on TV.  I would recommend this for anyone who is wanting to catch up on 1 show or the entire year.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad to see candy crush here it took so long already on level 160. But at least I don't have to set at my computer to play anymore.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|my son loves this game. we can play this one together.  its great for Learning colors.  even dad likes it. great family game.
B00594XOZU|3.0|I've deleted the app so someone PLZ fix kik because if u don't you will have more haters then right now
B00F7YHDWC|2.0|This game is violent. I liked it but my 7 year old sister doesn't. She tried to play but she got scared of the lion one! Her favorite is to pop the balloons. Never let your younger siblings play it!
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I rated this book a four because it told what the  words are and what they  mean. Also if it was noun verb or adjectives. So i
B003SI05PG|3.0|Movie was good. At least what I got to see of it. The streaming kept stopping and starting from the beginning of the movie. Finally got so frustrated just turned it off!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is awesome but very additive.  cant stop playing candy crush!  just wish didn't have to wait so long for more lives
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Its a fun addictive game but I dont like the wait time for new lives when I am in the mood to play or bored.
B00BMKH5NW|4.0|I really liked this book. This is actually my third book by Rainbow Rowell, and I have to say I just love her. She's an incredible writer.<br /><br />Fangirl is a story about a girl who's force to live without her twin sister for the first time, so she's trying to find out who she is without her. She gets a friend in her roommate when she's not looking and she meets the perfect boy for her but she doesn't know how to do the boyfriend-girlfriend thing.<br /><br />The characters were really cute. It's amazing, but Rainbow Rowell always manages to create these lovable characters. Cathie's an innocent girl, a little shy, while Levi is outgoing and happy and fun. They complement each other. I love how she describes them and every situation they go through.<br /><br />This is definitely a cute and light story. I enjoyed it very much.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I hadn't heard of this until my daughter mentioned it.  Now I'm at a higher level and giving her hints!
B001MTENOC|2.0|As a person who has read literally thousands of Near Death Experiences, plus accounts of After Death Communication, and personally am friends with a multitude of experiencers and those who routinely meet discarnate spirits (ranging from nasty to Divine), I am concerned by the uniformity of the hypnosis transcripts.<br /><br />In general, outside this book, people's accounts of the non-physical world differ tremendously. There is very rarely absolute concord on descriptions of God, processes, soul evolution, and astral locations, even among those with similar theologies (e.g. even among people who had NDEs involving Jesus). Contrasted with that diversity, the subjects in this book seem to use the exact same terminology when describing energy colors (\\"dark yellow\\" - really? always \\"dark\\" yellow? Not even \\"more intense yellow\\" or \\"deeper\\" yellow?). That's just the vocabulary. The theology is all oriented to New Age \\"ascended master\\" doctrine.<br /><br />I can understand the depression of some readers after reading this book. The idea of enforced reincarnation (as described here and in some other books) does sound quite tedious. Even the concept of pre-planned life tragedies (as described in many books) can be depressing. But at least the best Near Death Experience or other spiritual books convey a sense of limitless joy, hope, and potential. This book so far is not the worst for squashing a sense of wonder about the spiritual world, but it's certainly not something that invokes delight in the Infinite, either.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Moriarty is new to me and I love her style of writing.  &#34;The Husband's Secret&#34; embraces  the mystery, romance, and humor in simple, real life.  The young mother has found a letter written to her from her husband in case of his death.  Her quandry is that he is still alive!  Should she read it or should she not?  I liked this book so well, I immediately loaded Moriarty's &#34;What Alice Forgot&#34; on my iPod and I am enjoying listening to it right now!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It is truly a good product. Can't wait for more 'chromecast' intergration on all platforms to allow us to stream effortlessly.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Another book that I have recommended to many of my girlfriends<br />One plot<br />Several key players<br />They all come together at the end<br />And the plot closure is very satisfying
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun game, hate the &quot;free to play&quot; model, I would rather pay $4.99 or whatever, I won't allow myself to be nickel and dimed to death with micro transactions, even for a fun game like this.  I also have some issues with the cut scenes not drawing properly, on my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1, but I skip them anyways .
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|I loved Behind the Candelabra, and so did my husband.  He initially said he wasn't interested in watching it with me, but got hooked within the first few minutes of watching.  Maybe not a great movie, but definitely well done and engaging.
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|This game is full of action and is addicting to those grand theft auto fans the only bad thing is it takes up a lot of space on your device
0385537131|5.0|Impossible to put down....well crafted.  Of course it was predictable after reading all of his books - does anyone really think his lawyer will lose? A book to savor.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I thought this game was very fun but had some problems when I played online. Other than that I recommend this game to everyone
B0036S4B6M|5.0|just what we ordered, use in our daily smoothy  easier to get than a trip to Whole Foods every few weeks
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I would recommend this game to everyone but sometimes the game would freeze up and the monsters won't spawn at time to time
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Nice to watch before Catching Fire comes out! which is in 25 days. Watching it @ an IMAX in Colorado on that Thursday November 21th 11pm
B00FOU1O3S|4.0|I really like this game. No glitches on my kindle fire. I love the graphics. Not a lot of explanation, but you can figure most things out within a few tries. It is a fun game. The kids love it and the mom loves it.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Rodriguez is unique singer & composer!<br />Finally he is recgized a such by the music world. Good for him & FOR us.

B00846REIS|4.0|I personally liked this book better than 50 shades of grey. It was a great read and I loved that the whole story wasn't completed in book one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is kinda like temple run and minion rush! I love this game! I have been playing it for a year and haven't deleted I got it in 2012!! Get it you will love it

B00007KWHG|5.0|Great music and we love it. We listen to it almost eveyday either at home or in the car. Terrific
006202406X|5.0|When I was reading some of the reviews I was almost afraid to read Allegiant. I was terrified that I'd end up hating the trilogy I loved so much. Once I read it though I was happy I did. I 100% understand why people were upset. I was upset but not angry. I'd still recommend this trilogy to people. It was sad at a part, but all dynastopian books are sad at one point or another. Veronica Roth is still one of my favorite authors & this is still one of my favorite trilogies regardless. So all you people out there saying how terrible it is because it didn't necessarily go the way you wanted it to...shut up and stop being a &#34;factionless pansycake&#34; & write your on darn trilogy then!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Excellent fun, exactly the game I've been looking for. Look forward to leps world 3. Keep up the great game development. Cheers
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I don't like the constant timeouts unless I purchase more time. I wanted relief from day to day expenses not more. Game is compelling but at a price I can't afford right now.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|5 stars adventure gaming at it's best. Can not put it down. Great game once you start you can not put it down.
B00F91SCXC|1.0|This is an incredible stupid movie. I only watched it for about 20 minutes until Pitt suggested that the wall in Gaza was raised to stop a zombie attack. Pleeeease!!!!
0439023513|4.0|I love this book. The ending was a bit sucky and was a cop out, but what is to be expected on teen science fiction.<br /><br />About my actual purchase:<br />The book was delivered very quickly and the product was in very good condition. I have no complaints.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|A really interesting documentary and the dvd was in really great shape.  The music was also really really really (have to use 19 words) fantastic.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|I always liked the superhero in the comic books i read growing up, and this movie took it to a great new level. Loved the movie and the story behind it!

B00FI7XBIS|4.0|V for Vampire is a cute \\"Angry Bird\\" type of game. You pick up bombs, position your vampire, and throw the bomb.  Object is to get the girl (of course).<br /><br />Game is easy to play and is entertaining.  Not very difficult.<br /><br />Works well on my Samsung Galaxy S4.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|I loved Divergent and Insurgent. Really. I did. What is wrong with HEA? After everything that Tris has been through, she deserved it. I can look past the bad writing. But not this. This book would have been much more enjoyable if the ending wasn't so terrible.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A book to be read by young and old and anyone in between. The author portrays a family's experience and those of others involved over the course of 5th grade.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|It is the worst app ever because it is so so slow I had to delete this app 18 times unorder to make it fast.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game.  So addicted that I dream about sometimes when I'm sleeping.  Wish I never run out of lives :).
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Brilliant idea, coherent plot and finely etched characters. I just can't wait for the story to continue. There are so many loose ends to be tied up.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was thrilling from<br /> Beginning to end. I couldn't put it down! An excellent choice for readers young ans old.
