B006ICTKRS|4|I did not expect much from these judging from other reviews of other aftermarket coils. They work and I don't have any problems with them other than slight cold missing that might be unrelated. I wasn't going to pay the money for the overpriced factory coils for a car that has 265k on the odometer, so for $80 they were a steal !
B001ABPKUS|5|Good value, work great
B000C1LLNC|5|I got them for my Nissan Altima, great price and love the performance so far, will have to wait and see how they hold up but they were an exact match for the factory pads and went together very easily
B007NQ7LSI|4|No problems after purchasing Heavy duty rivet gun.  P.S. Lowes doesn't carry them.  Had to order on line. Keyed up without  any difficulty.  Seems to be working just fine.
B00GRHRYHM|1|These really don't work. There is noway you will like these mirrors. The only thing it is good for is for the police not to stop you. The glass on it is horrible. Absolutely do not get them. You are better of getting the mounting brackets and using the original mirrors off the door.
B00KL3ALGO|5|easy on/off application. they are darker than other shades I've seen.
B004IE98FC|4|This control arm should fit 99-04 Jeep Grand Cherokee WJ's.  I installed it on my 2003 Grand Cherokee Overland.  Overall the part was well constructed; the only issue is the brake line holes are not tapped, just drilled.  You can force the factory  bolts into holes, but I tapped them correctly.  The threads are M8-1.25 & M6x1.00.  If you are replacing this control are I highly suggest you replace the ball joint on top of the differential.  I say this for 2 reasons, if the control arm bushing is worn out the ball joint is probably worn out AND the install is much easier because getting to the nut on the ball joint is very hard when on the car.
B009IFIB0Y|5|So easy and it fit perfectly
B00515QUP8|5|unbelievable that I would find trim exactly as I expected, fantastic.this ewxperience is very rewarding because i never thought that I would find this produce thanks
B00144FZUG|4|greasy stuff.
B000VKVXKA|4|Such a great deal compared to the ones purchased at the factory!
B009YN2A7U|5|Nice fit. Keeps the look, and I can wear a hat at faster than 25mph.
B005B0SC0O|5|Excelent Thanks!!!
B0002MB80C|5|Excellent product, fits perfectly on the steering wheel.  The only thing that is missing, is more color choices.  Especially a lighter color would be nice to have.
B005G8DJ0O|5|good
B007DN6IS0|5|I am so glad I purchased this battery, I eliminated 20 pounds from my motorcycle, by replacing the previous lead acid battery! I have all the cranking amps I need and never have had a problem!
B00EGH7KCE|5|Good to go. Thumbs up. Fast shipping
B000JZN0CQ|5|I replaced the air filter in my 95 Corolla w/ this. It literally took me 45 seconds. The air filter box is only secured by clips. I flipped the 4 clips off, lifted the top of the filter box & removed the old dirty filter. Popped this in. Snapped 4 clips down. Closed the hood. Done.<br /><br />This filter was $8.62 when I bought it. Easily 1/2 the price as any FRAM/Purolator/STP filter you will find in Wal-Mart, Advance, AutoZone where they run around $15-$20.<br /><br />Also just my opinion that these replaceable filters are all basically the same. Doesn't really matter what brand you choose. So why pay more?
B00029JYS8|3|Died on me after a few months of usage.
B00G3YYSLE|4|works great worth the money!!!!!!!
B006GLEBIO|5|these are super bright but you do need an exrta cable to reach the rear of the car.
B0041CDPQO|5|this was a good fit for my radar detector and my Garmin system (awesome) It has a six foot cord and easy to hook up.
B0009I2OIE|5|This was the only place I could find this for my husband. He said he had no problems with this.
B001JK1A4K|5|I installed this parking assistant laser a few weeks ago and it beats the type that ties into the garage door, hands down! I like the constant beam, it is easy to install and have had now problems whatsoever! I recommend this product!
B0041CDTOW|5|Works very well. Comfortable even in long rides.
B000C9I0CY|1|When I received the valve it looked just like the original one in the car, but once I tried to replace it the threads do not match up and you are not able to screw it in all the way. I am sure there will be a loss of air due to the valve not being screwed all the way in. I am now going to have to look for another solution to this or buy another product because this one did not fit in 100% like AC Delco says.
B005OJ3T0U|4|THIS ITEM LOOKS GOOD AND FITS FAIRLY WELL.  IT IS EASY TO INSTALL WITH A FEW SCREWS.
B00BD9RICA|3|Hav had a problem with the gaskets leeking. Have to use silicon to stop the leek. never had to with original equipment. I have owned several air cooled VW.
B001O13BLO|5|Received my rear liftgate struts for my Scion TC and got just what I ordered, 2 days earlier than the estimated delivery date.  Everything arrived brand new and in perfect condition.  Easy to remove old struts and install the new ones. Thank you!
B008XIQ5KA|5|Received as described, giving as a gift.
B003V1BHX4|5|Awesome service will definitely order again
B003EP2ZQU|5|Now I can load a half ton of concrete in my 1999 VW Passat and it doesn't even squat the back end.  These airbags rock!
B005FO2R1G|5|great!!!
B001D6GYLO|5|Good quality and worked for me! Copper ionizer went out on my swimming pool so I made my own and power it with this panel. Works great!
B006VOSH5O|1|very loud and not what i wanted
B000CPJLV2|5|I needed to clean up calipers and make sure it stayed looking good, get all three from VHT-cleaner,primer,color,clear. It'll turn out sweet!!
B000CGFGLA|5|Very fast shipping, laid sideways in a large flat rate box.  Good thing it is gel mat construction.  Battery fit 02 Miata battery tray and hold down perfectly.  CCA rating a little lower than the dead Westco it replaced, but turned the car over with vigor.  Good deal on a good battery.
B0007TQWKQ|4|Does not really look like fabric but that may be my application of the product.
B00HDFF5AA|5|These fit perfectly and were very easy to get in place.  Great price and product.  I was worried at first because the box was opened when it arrived but everything was fine.
B0023VE104|5|not everyday you can replace a housing and bulb for 13 bucks. 2005 to 2007 jeeps this is a must have, crack turn signal made my ride look cheap, replaced it now it looks brand new.
B004A34G94|5|Good on time
B006IWQGZW|5|Great flaps, perfect for the truck.
B00480BWA0|5|This does the job it is intended to do.
B00HU6N3LK|5|I'll admit, I'm obsessive about my shoes, I buy the best and take care of them by hand.<br />I discovered Leather Honey Cleaner, ordered it immediately based on three factors:<br />-the manufacturers statement<br />-family business, Made In America👍<br />-reviews<br />And as expected this is a wonderful, very cost effective product that I m rating A+<br />Oh, and worth repeating, family business Made in the USA, that's a beautiful thing.
B003ZIXDJ4|5|Perfect fit for the 2006 Sienna.  Keep rain, snow and mud in one place
B000MDB6EY|5|used these goggles for a few years work well nice and cheap, and they fit my melon, won,t last forever
B007ROUBYC|5|Direct replacement, very satisfied!!
B004IYB9X6|5|Nice item
B00IUU6O9I|5|Customer service did a complete turn around. Over all seat covers, we're not bad once I seen them on. Not a strong smell to them, and very nice colors.
B004SSAEYW|3|I have purchased this for my Honda Accord Sedan, not the quality which I am expected and, it doesn't come with secure belt. So, you need to purchase additional chain and lock to use this.
B00LGNF5UK|1|Did not work.  Do not buy !!!made in chine
B0091QLN0U|5|I had an accident in this helmet. Banged up the helmet really bad, totaled the bike, broke my wrist in three spots but my head was perfectly fine.<br /><br />Purchasing a new one for my new bike.

B003VAYRNM|5|Fit great
B001C6JBYM|1|About one year later and the larger front bushing is cracked again, and yes I can feel this when I drive.<br />I suggest you spend the extra money and buy the Honda replacement part.
B000Z0HVHA|4|gave plenty of cord  to reach top of the truck was pleased with this order fast shipping like that I don't have to pull and have cord in the way very pleased
B00JOC1U8Q|4|For the price, this is a decent cover. It's somewhat flimsy and isn't heavy enough to conform perfectly to my trunk, but it serves it purpose!
B005VLQXG8|5|Perfect replacement
B00AKGBHSS|5|Exactly what I needed . Had a blowout on back trailer tire and it tore the one-pull apart. Fortunately I had installed stabilizer bars it was tight enough to hold jack leg up.
B00STNDYIA|5|It surpassed what I was expecting. Very durable and breaths great.  Heavy stitching and will last a long time.
B001JT0DIU|5|I'm not sure exactly how to setup for 11 meter cb but most plug into usb and pc. And wala your set like the mirage does but however I love cb band and I'm partial to 70cm and 2 now a days this don't have them but fm is great must follow procedure tho them hams will run you outta there get ur licence before rag chewing I'm still a new ham after a year now still learn new tricks but I'm a trucker I run bearcat 980 with all uniden add-ons even the PA with Palomar linear 600HD & quad band TYT th9800 quad both in my rig I enjoy them both programming was a new thing to me but I'm good with that now so dive into this hobby if your interested only gets better
B004EKYB7U|5|Direct replacement, works as expected. Decent shipping.
B000GU1ZFS|1|Used  for about 2 weeks everyday before all the keys would not unlock it. Luckily I was at work with cutting tools to cut it off my bike.
B003Y9GCSI|5|Thanks, Quick Shipping
B002915LL6|3|This product is just OK. After I applied to tires they did not have a high shine I was looking for.
B000XECJES|4|Good for cleaning delicate surfaces. I use it for drying my car.<br /><br />My mom also likes these for every day cleaning. One cloth lasts about 1-2 months.
B00C0SQRW0|1|Did not fit listed models. Had to give to another friend with an older model of the same bike. Decent quality.
B006N97HDU|5|Excellent parts !  Genuine GM quality!
B00JHPJMW6|5|Great price. Perfect fit and so easy to install!
B006QNN3T0|4|This bracket worked well with the softail app. I did change the inside clip to a stronger type c clip.
B0054WI7CW|5|Customers come in and expect immediate oil changes...that oil can be quite hot!  I usually have to let go and end up dropping the plug in the pan...later, I have to &#34;go fishing&#34;.  This tool is typical of OTC...specialty tools to make the job easier and/or better.  I first thought the flex drive should be a bit longer, but...not so...OTC got it right...it's perfect!
B000BRLHWM|5|I wanted to sell my old iPhone 4 but the back had a crack in it. I saved a lot of money switching out the plate myself. Some places wanted $30 to just switch out the back plates (when I had the new back-plate already), so I got one of the special screwdrivers and did it myself. It was super simple and the screwdriver (on Amazon) was only $5 or so. Totally worth it. A lot of retailers don't carry the right screwdriver (even the tech kits don't have one small enough).
B0087R3D16|4|They look nice. The clips that were included did not work at all. I had to drill and use the screws that were included but I could have used a few more screws. I'll be picking some up at the hardware store and adding them to complete and ensure a tight fit. I didn't like drilling the holes but I'm sure that is the best way to secure them in place. I'm worried about the road salt in Wisconsin eating away at the screw holes.
B008NGK61Q|4|Very nice pants, good price and features. With Drizle it works very well, I don't know in rain or heavy rain.
B000ALDY7A|5|My wife rubs the CRV up against various things (fences, signs, etc.) on a regular basis.  I have painted the same spot on the bumper several times.  Thank goodness for touch-up paint.
B00230P2E4|4|&#62; I have long thin fingers. Using these sponge like covers increases the grip's diameter making my hand more comfortable and a bit less fatigued working the throttle and clutch.<br /><br />&#62; When putting these on use lots of RUBBING ALCOHOL as the lubricant as it's better than others in my experience.<br /><br />&#62; Only down side is, these grips retain water when it rains. To guard against that, there are other alternatives on the market such as Grip Buddies, but are twice the cost.
B0074BQP8O|5|Absolutely brilliant! was a good buy and worth the money- the delivery was ultra fast. They fit perfectly and look amazing. I would highly recommend it as it will definitely transform your car.
B006338I20|5|I give this product 5 stars for sure! What a clever idea! Whoever crafted this has great skill and imagination! It goes great with the rest of my Totoro collection! And, it's functional, so my boyfriend can't get mad at me haha! Sooo cute, I love it! Looks even better in person than the pictures :) Thanks so much!!!
B0086OE2FQ|5|Very good quality. The material seems pretty solid, and they do what they are meant to.
B000JZN0SU|5|Works well
B0006HP9VM|5|I have used these before and never had any problems ,  can feel the difference in my motor so I will continue with Quality.
B008K7ZIFW|5|Went to the Chevy dealer and they told me it would be a couple hundred to get a new fob and have it programmed so I went online with the part number and found this.  It's worked well and lasted longer than the parts that came with the car and is still ticking like a TImex.  I would definitely get this again and the best part is that I was out under $100 to replace and program it.
B00B2AFA0W|1|I ordered this for my JK Wrangler.  Spend 2 days painting the lettering and when I went to install, It DOES NOT fit a Dana 44 Rear. On my JK.  I sent an message to them about it but did not get a response so after a week I decided to live a feedback.
B001C4SL3G|4|Typical K&N
B006X32JPC|3|This switch did not have wiring instructions so if you are not sure about your skills that may be an issue. The switch is kid of large and you wil need liek a half inch hole for it to be installed. I liked the quality if the switch.
B000CD8IDG|5|Purchased for an 2002 Solara.  They work great, clean wipe and no noise.  I have not had them long enough to comment on the longevity but I am sure they will stand up.
B00062YVPW|5|I got it last week, just tested it on one of the tires and it looks good (very nice finish behind the glass and outside body), reading is accurate, feels nice and heavy (which I translate to better built quality than cheaper lighter products that will break easily)    I like the fact that you can press the button to release air when its inserted into the valve.    I also like the fact that it holds the pressure reading even when you take it out of the valve.    Two thumbs up, this specific item is a must have item in your car.
B0031H0LF8|5|good price point, direct replacement, have put 1K miles on car since installed with no problems, could not have been happier.
B00DJWB97E|5|Looks great with a chrome 49ers license plate frame! Just had to buy a screw with a smaller head to fit within the screw caps. They are extremely secure once they are over the screws.
B002AKFA94|4|Easy to put together, good base, clear stop sign. It is quite sensitive though, a breeze or when you walk by will make it start to flash.
B0033WNLFS|5|I bought this to carry a hitch mounted cargo platform for my generators, when i use my truck camper. I also use it to park my boat in difficult locations or to launch the boat when the truck camper is on.<br />The hitch was easy to install, you do have to remove the bumper but that's not to tough.
B003YK96YO|5|WOW this was the easiest installation ever.<br />It took all of 10 minutes , just 2 Bolts to on my Bumper , 2 nuts to loosen and tighten again once I placed the arm onto the bumper slide the 3 inserts into the step and tighten with an Allen wrench DONE
B00CPDBX0G|5|Love these bulbs! Much nicer than my OEM bulbs. Great product, great price!
B00F674GF2|5|i hope it fits , still have not had a chance to put on my truck,
B005FWWUNS|5|I mounted it on top of the speedo cover, put the remote sensor under the fairing. It's hard to believe but there is actually a 10 degree difference between the &#34;outside&#34; temp and &#34;inside&#34; the air pocket behind the windshield (1983 GL1100). The instructions are horrible, it took me hours to translate the &#34;translated&#34; Chinese. It does come with a battery, but it doesn't tell you that you need to move it from the dummy holder to the working holder. The blue backlight is useless in sunlight. The orange works well except when the sun is directly on it. GL1100's are notorious for failed or failing stators. The voltage monitor should help you avoid any problems.
B009MATEPG|5|Fits perfect in my 2014 Sprinter.
B001DX5JP4|5|after a year of tring differnt cheap one i got a real ac delco and now no more service engine soon light
B0041C8XA2|5|Being a motorcyclist of a few years getting close to 10,000 Mi. experience, I like to ride. One of the first things I noticed I would go through halogen bulbs every few months with the amount i ride. Besides not being that bright brand new, they're always on and dim quite fast. Living in New Jersey I do most of my serious riding at night, as daytime traffic in the summer is dangerous, and stop and go is not fun. With this on the other hand the light output is many times greater than stock or even expensive PIAA bulbs, giving off a very white light with the slightest tinge of blue. I would compare it to moonlight in color. I used to have to ride with high beam on constant, not anymore! The HID bulb is rated for 3-5 years of running time, and should it ever fail before then replacement bulbs are easily obtained on the web usually coming in a pack of two in all ranges of Kelvin temp. Took them out this past night and just got in and i must say, Hands down THE BEST INVESTMENT TO ANY MOTORCYCLE ENTHUSIAST. I had no need to adjust my beam, didn't get flashed once and passed by many of NJ's finest with no more then a tip of the hat.. So no extravagant projector setup necessary, as long as your low beam isn't in peoples faces just as it should be with halogen, no erratic beams like in some car/trucks. Setup was a breeze only minor inconvenience is the ground wire had to be extended just a bit as i'm running a hog and not a sportbike. Safe riding fellow cyclists!
B001OK6LDA|5|Good price, delivered quickly, was as described .
B003DJIJCQ|5|I decided to take my 14' travel trailer and go camping for the Memorial Day weekend. So here I was pulling into the last available spot in one of the rows near the bath-house. It was late Friday afternoon when a thunderstorm started brewing and before you know it, rain starting falling hard then a sudden strike of lightening with a deafing sound of thunder at the same time, when all my electricity (which is powered by my Parallax Converter/Charger) goes out. I later learned that nearly the entire row of RV's where I was parked lost their Converter/Chargers due to lightning striking and knocking out almost all of them leaving us with dead batteries.  The good news is the RV repairman that is recommended by the campground was there and advised me what to do.<br /><br />I went online and went to my favorite online shopping site, Amazon.com, and after reading some reviews, ordered the Parallax Power Supply 7355RU 55 ADC Converter/Charger.  They offered Free Shipping and I didn't have to pay any taxes and my repairman told me that he could not get the same exact product for the price I paid anywhere so I ordered it and upon arrival of the product had him install it and now it is better than before since Parallax offered the upgraded model for the same price.<br /><br />If you need a Converter for your RV this is the place to shop so click on the link below.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003DJIJCQ Parallax Power Supply 7355RU 55 ADC Converter/Charger]]
B002BEI0JQ|5|This is one of the best tools ever to dry a car. Learned about it from a friend who used it on my car to dry it. Love love love it!  Cuts down the time to dry your car. And perfect when you come out in the morning and your car has morning dew on your back window and you can't see out.
B005EJGSQ2|3|Well it did say basic, hooked up easy works ok. When I took it out of the box the plastic cover for the clamp were the wire goes into the cover fell off. The screws that hold the cover on seem to be to short ? Any way used a clamp and some epoxy and it was better than new.
B009GM1K84|3|I absolutely loved the way it looked. Broke off after a few months of using it.
B0082ME126|1|They are badly cut not at all what you see here. And they come with instructions but the way they are set up it is no wonder he give you 'extra' one because these are going to be a real pain to install. I am so disappointed with this purchase.
B004I13JTQ|5|Was a perfect copy of the original. Fit perfect.
B00JASCNEE|5|Great
B001EQN93Y|5|Fits well, good feel, not too stiff, not too soft. What more is there to say? If I lose one or tear one I'll definitely buy another pair.
B0016KA9I6|5|Easily installed and looks great on our Jeep Wrangler. The shipping was quick.
B003ZJQ56Q|1|It fell off going down the road it should've fit tighter should get one for free but that's my opinion
B008BYQ72M|5|Quick shipping and lights work great !
B000BODVEW|4|Unfortunately did not fit our electric pump but good quality.
B00AV9EBIM|4|Would have been 5 stars but they changed the shipping date to a week later..but the decal is awesome love the looks it gets
B000COCU84|5|They are what they are...  work great and look great.  same product i would have paid almost double for at autozone
B0009OR8TS|5|works well.
B004306VTC|4|well made, and well used
B000CFKS96|5|This kit contains everything needed to rebuild an alternator in less than an hour and saved me the extra $80 a rebuilt alternator costs.  The instructions were totally adequate.
B000KL5CFW|1|Holds dirt very well.  Slippery .... very slippery when wet.
B007IV9IX4|5|Well made
B004K2FSXI|5|I bought this for my Godson and he loves it and his boss wants one also!
B008I7Q4O8|5|very pleased with product
B000CO7ASO|5|I have had these in for about 13 months and no problems. Allthough I do know how to correctly install. DO NOT TOUCH THE BULB GlASS!!! The finger oil will severely shorten the life span.
B000IZGIA8|5|Recently it seems like cigarette taxes are going up every month. When a pack of smokes went over $7.00, I said, to the clerk at Kwikie Mart, \\"enough is enough, there must be a cheaper way to get a nicotine fix.\\" She turned me on to a roll your own cigarette machine. I really enjoy smoking while driving, but soon discovered that using the rolling machine while driving was unpractical. It needed to be on a firm platform. While giving a co-worker IT guy a ride home, he noticed my troubles while trying to roll a smoke, with the machine balanced precariously on the center console. He quickly pulled out his Blackberry smart-phone and had googled a picture to show me of the Laptop Steering Wheel Desk. Eureka, that's just what I need to put the rolling machine on!  Now after purchasing a Laptop Steering Wheel Desk and with little practice on back roads, while on a one-way 30 minute commute to work, I can roll an average of 20 cigarettes. That's $3 less a pack than pre-rolled. I smoke about 40 cigs a day, so that's a savings of $6.00 per day or over $2,000 per year! If I live another ten years, The Laptop Steering Wheel Desk will have saved me over $20,000!!!
B00DI3DV6G|5|they are great carrie around  need to be more stronger
B0049C5ZUU|2|when purchasing this item i read the reviews and ignored the review someone wrote about this part coming loose after installation.,well they were right, the part rattles loose after two days of around the town driving. the reason is the bozos that  engineered the part did not include a nut with the ablity to self lock sufficiently thus it loosening after about 30-40 miles.,yes it was installed professionally and retightened with an impact gun.,bottom line poor design on the lock nut.,hopefully amazon will start paying attention to negitive reviews about a product and get cracking and do something about it, like tell the supplier to include a lock nut that works.<br />mr.scott
B00FN1ZE66|5|Was worried at first that this wouldn't work as I have a big ATV but this fit quite well. No complaints at all
B003AYUXGE|5|Heavy duty, built to last...wow
B00AFBO0ZA|5|Arrived on time and works great!
B0027AEUF2|5|Nice product for what they cost
B00FEH2CTG|1|Very poor quality, a flashlight tapped on my hood would put out more light.  I ended up putting my old lights back in. Now I have these expensive look pretty dust collector's with no use for them
B000CKPHZQ|1|According to the product finder this product &#34;fits&#34; an 08 Jetta.  It does not.
B000CB4WLU|5|very good
B00404VTTI|3|This is a decent product.  The dots are secure and the dice are attractive.  Mine came with a minor sewing error along one side, but I don't think these will come apart when I use them as props in my musical.
B002RSIK4G|5|Highly recommend easy to apply. Repaired leak in camper. Fast shipping and easy to follow instructions.
B0008D6NLY|5|This tire gel works well. applying it is consuming ............. i will recommend to others
B000SKV4T8|5|Great lubrication for the Harley.  I use in engine, transmission, and primary.  Runs great and seems to make a noticeable difference in oil pressure and smoother shifting vs using two different synthetic lubricates with different viscosities. Cheaper too.
B00ISQPAJ4|4|I had a problem with this item but the problem has been resolved  it's a good item for this type of bike
B000C9SR90|5|This product works just fine in the application.  I would expect nothing less from ACDelco.  It was delivered on time and in good condition.
B00KYGRBS4|5|Looks great on my Jeep!!
B0006MTRJ2|5|Bought this hose to use in the laundry area as an extension from the laundry tub.  It makes it a lot easier to clean stuff without having to pick them up and put them in the laundry tub.  I make wine and it is perfect for rinsing our the fermenting tubs and carboys without having to pick them up and put them in the sink.  Also able to use it to fill and clean my carpet cleaner on the ground without having to pick it up over the sanitary tubs.
B000FBWSVS|5|nice sticker
B000C5WCN6|5|Easy install. Perfect fit. Got back lots of power and fuel economy in my 1997 Honda Civic LX. Super fast shipping too.
B00HRXNLIG|5|Great product
B00JBIR9BU|5|I love this so much. I can see what people are saying about the purple but its still the blue that I wanted. Very awesome everyone just turns to look at my truck. Ended up inspiring a lot people to get these lights
B00JRE38EA|4|looks nice, a bit longer than glass 94 so had to remove top LED to clear cover but the four remaining LEDs sufficient for my requirements.
B002T4OB5U|5|Great shocks.
B000HBNUFY|3|I bought this one and applied as prescribed. The brakes indeed became quieter but not completely. I still hear some squealing when the pads are cold in the morning. Also you'd better off with a squeeze container which should allow a more precise application to the calipers without needing to cover the rotors. With this container you need to shake it like crazy in order to get a decent amount out of it.
B00JM2080O|5|Perfect fit and color is pretty much spot on!!<br />A++++
B004ZF4OP8|3|First set of bulbs had cracked insulators and would not turn on. Kensun sent out replacements VERY promptly. Definately a good, customer service oriented company. Ballasts work well but the bulbs are of fairly low quality and the light output is sub par for an HID bulb at 55w. I recommend the Kensun ballasts, but go with a higher quality bulb (I recommend Morimoto XB35 bulbs from The Retrofit Source).
B000CM5C22|1|I put every specification of my car in the Amazon search. It said it was compatible with my 1999 Toyota Camry 4 Cylinder. I specifically bought this mirror because it was a power adjustable and power heated. However, when I replaced it with my completely broken mirror that was taped to my car I found out that the ports were not compatible. The mirror fits perfectly, but I cannot use the power adjusting or the power heating, which is the exact reason why I bought it. If Amazon says it’s compatible with my car they should say it’s completely compatible or at least have a note of what’s not compatible.<br /><br />I can’t even return this mirror because the broken one won’t even connect to my car anymore which means I’m stuck with this mirror. I’m completely unsatisfied with my purchase because I didn’t get what I wanted to buy.
B000AL8VD2|5|It's grease -= what can I say!
B00BIJINF6|4|as advertised. shipped on time
B0016C3STQ|5|Just what I needed at the right price!
B000VHT9GS|5|My car is 16 years old, still in good shape and I am and have been the only driver.  Over the past year or so, it would start and I would go to the shopping mall, but when I got ready to go home it would not start.  I would have to sit and wait for a while then try starting it again and pray that I would get home.  A gentleman told me about the Battery charger, I ordered it and started using it and I have not had any problem with my car starting when I get ready to go or to come home.  It is excellent and I would recommend that anyone that is having problem with battery to have a mechanic to check the battery, if it is in good shape, but something is draining it, try the battery charger first before purchasing a new battery.
B0052SF0LO|5|I had an area that needed some light, but did not have power it. Now I don't have to wonder anymore if someone comes close. This light takes care of itself.
B00KTIYXLU|5|worked  GREAT

B006BDGDXI|5|I received this product within days of ordering. However, I am having trouble finding a locksmith who is able to program it. I have had it for about a month now and have not been able to use it so I can't offer much insight on how it works.
B0002YR84K|4|Easy to use, Works well, though the directions could be written a bit more clearly.  Easy to use, Works well.

B003750FVE|5|Fits Nicely in my 2000 Honda accord. Go yankees! Lol
B00ME8TIJA|5|100%
B000Q86IQQ|1|the arms are so loose that the cup can fly out of the holder when you go around a corner. Also the color looks like black until  your in bright light and you see that it is purple. this thing sucks and I am returning it.
B007JMOUNK|5|arrived on time, well packaged . much more beefy than picture shows. more than enough for the task i will use it for.[ pulling 60 to 80 foot wind toppled trees off steep mountain side ]. should last decades. can see many other uses for this item in future.
B00A2YGDXM|3|The pink is like a baby pink :( not a hot pink like the pic shows unfortunately
B008MAZNR0|5|I've washed this Union Jack blanket and started using it. It is so soft and my little boy loves it! He's a big Doctor Who fan!!
B000CMFSWQ|5|very good
B00KJLMGYI|5|Snaps right onto my Audi hatch like original. Very strong resistance but I can't remember how strong the original were when new. Just as good as Audi original supports for fraction of cost.
B00L5TCA80|5|Excellent product received on time
B002XF382W|5|Very happy with this product. Easy to install. I plan on getting the set for the back.
B001MA58HC|2|These 9005 putco bulbs are low quality and do not fit into the factory headlight assembly. Not sure if that's how they're msking these now but was very disappointed. But the shipper was good. Unfortunately, I had to pay to ship them back.
B00VROSSKM|5|Nice all in one kit.
B00RMTCYD8|3|Looks good but doesn't fit perfectly
B00CQ7UBC2|5|Exactly what I needed and good quality
B00652MFLE|5|Quality clamps, work great!
B00586LJF6|5|The product was great; but the vendor was even better!  Orginally, I received the wrong product; AtomixAuto sent me the right product and gave me a box and prepaid label to return the wrong one.  They were super friendly; and very helpful.
B005HPOXY2|4|It looks like it will work.  We actually haven't been able to use it yet due to winter weather. We are waiting for summer weather before we use it.  Will update my rating if it changes.
B006EHAP7Q|2|Bought  two of them in anticipation for a camping trip with four granddaughters who love smores. Unfortunately the grills were awkward to hold over the coals, and the chocolate melted before the marshmallows were even warm.  Used only once and we went back to the old way.  Half the fun of smores is trying to toast the perfect marshmallow.
B000IEVL10|5|If you have to go through the soft touch car washes there is not a bug shield on the market that is safe for these car washes.  After about 2 months of not getting my truck all the way clean in the touch free car washes I took this bug shield off my truck.  Great product, I just couldn't clean my truck all the way.
B00076RLEK|5|Easy to install. Very satisfied with fit and quality of unit. Looks great on my truck. Installed in less than one hour
B003YHZV2S|5|works fine, good quality, I have a few hundred mostly off road miles on it with no problems need chain press tool to squeeze the rubber O-rings. I bought Motion Pro 08-0070 Mini Chain Press Tool and it worked fine.
B0017K69MA|5|A great product for getting those areas that are hard to clean on the inside windows of an automobile.  That's what I use it for, but I'm sure there are many other uses for it.
B00CS7T0IQ|2|returned had to use so many attachment that they ended up sticking out like big rig mirrors. To much for me.
B008HU853Y|4|very cute. I like it. this is my first time put this in my car. Wish it can take me good luck.
B006JS18ZS|3|Arrived without most mounting hardware, to their credit the company sent out most replacement parts very quickly - but not all the parts shown in the instructions.  That said, the install instructions need to be revised and after one day rack is stuck at one height.  I took the whole thing apart to try to unjam it, but no luck.  IT's at the right height for me so going to keep it.  Overall it's a decent & sturdy unit but could be, a little better engineered.
B00N9HNKEE|5|beatiful
B0018PW15I|5|great product fast shipping
B003O49BG8|5|Just what he wanted.
B003V57NUQ|5|Half the price of other J carriers but very solid, went together fast and carries my 10' kayak securely. A great buy.

B008J438L2|5|I ordered a eastwood 175 with spool gun  and wow this spool gun does alot better job than my miller and hobart spoolguns by a long shot. This is the spool gun to buy if you want to weld aluminum with ease. Thanks eastwood for anther awesome welding products
B00JKTHOEM|5|They look awesome on my 2012 civic si sedan very happy with em
B0031HC8PY|4|Good fit, hope it lasts longer than my previous one from another company.
B00AYXM4DY|5|Wipe New is amazing. My truck is 7 years old and loaded with black plastic.<br />It looks like the day I bought it now.<br />I highly recommend this product.<br />GR
B00GOW6VAQ|5|Met my expectations and a good price.
B00BI29ZM8|5|I have used Wizard products for a long time. This is great as a carpet cleaner for your auto or home carpets. Works better at removing summer bugs on front of your car than Wizard's Bug Release product.
B00E89REL2|5|Cool meter. Good readout and can be calibrated if necessary. Very useful.
B009HVPV4S|5|It was what I expected and more, the online update was easy to install, and screen easy to read. Great
B007QQOX0E|5|Perfect fit. Unbeatable value. Highly recommended.
B0032VCT9E|2|My order indicated an HID 6000K, but the package I received was an 8000K. At first I thought the upgrade would be better.  However, after installation, to my disappointment, the lights turned out to be very bluish with a fair amount of constant flickering. I then found out from experts that the 8000K spectrum is more bluish and not as bright to the human eyes. So I emailed the company, eSpoiler, to ask for an exchange for the 6000K, but until this day, I have not received a response.
B000C55T7W|5|I bought these to replace the completely shot rears on my 2000 Park Avenue. Although no instructions or documentation of any sort are provided, the installation is very straightforward with only basic tools required. Some other reviews noted difficulty with the bottom mounting bolts/clips, so as I precaution, I doused them in WD-40 (as I didn't have PB Blaster) prior to removal . Everything came off and reinstalled in about 3 hours in my driveway. No additional parts were required, and the air lines hooked right up. If you have the appropriate power tools and a set of jack stands, getting done in an hour seems feasible. The ride quality and stability over road imperfections is far better than at any other point during my ownership of the car. The load leveling switch is not working now, but this is likely due to the abuse it took while I drove the car around on completely blown shocks.<br />As stated in several other reviews, the shock body is in fact black, but I suspect few people will be upset about this.
B0092JSDPY|5|It's a pretty decal and easy to apply. The lime green is very similar to the color depicted. I would definitely buy it again.
B00BTSHNNO|5|I haven't attached it to my helmet yet, but after opening the package and fiddling with it and learning the controls, (everything is controlled by two buttons and a dial), it seems amazing already. The FM tuner works amazing (even in my basement), and best of all, the sound is not only crisp/clear, but LOUD. I set it up across my room and I had no trouble making out what the speakers were playing. I couldn't imagine having this thing on at full volume right up next to my ear in a helmet but it sure is nice to have that function.<br /><br />The package contains:<br />Clamp mount<br />Sticky mount<br />Alan wrench for tightening the clamp<br />Sena device<br />Wired microphone<br />Spacers so the speakers can be closer<br />Velcro sticky speaker mounts<br />USB charging/computer cable<br />A quick start guide in a bunch of lingos<br />And a bunch of easy guide papers<br /><br />The box was not packaged well (it was in a cardboard box about the size of a shoebox with a popped bubble-wrap piece in it.), the edges of my packing tape were cut but the piece going down the middle to hold the flaps together were not. Even after all that though, the actual Sena box was packaged well by itself and nothing was hurt.<br />You need to do a firmware upgrade when you get the chance and the box contains directions for doing that as well. Everything is user friendly and functions amazing. I cannot stress how well this item has been working for me and I've only had it about 3 hours.
B0001URFNY|3|Rubber was just what I needed. However, the adhesive is like cheap rubber cement. Had to remove adhesive with a solvent and use a super glue to get the rubber to stay in place. A good double sided 3M tape would probably work for most applications. The material is about 1/4&#34; thick so its good and heavy. I tried 3M safety walk which has a sandpaper type surface and it would not grip a smooth surface. This did.
B000BPWSBI|5|Thanks, Great Product and FAST shipping!
B00ELJ60RI|5|My 'Plan A' was to just win the lottery and retire super wealthy at age 18. Years later I'm working in the oil patch getting wealthy a little more slowly. This sticker adds a bit of realistic humor that I can wear on my hardhat. Gets lots of comments and a few chuckles from other folks who have come to learn that Plan A rarely comes to fruition.
B008O9DV78|1|the valve worked fine for about 6 uses, then the flimisy connector for back flushing broke off, no big deal I'll order a new backflush fitting,  well all phone numbers for the manufacturer are disconnected , so no repairing, dont waste your money because you cant get parts which you will surely need in time because the plastic at the base of the fitting is just to thin.
B004HAC9YO|4|Works good, but sold the piece of equipment that I put it on.
B0071F2CQW|5|The replacement headlight performed better than the original. update technology was evident. one two three four five six seven eight.
B00CIJ3T1S|5|Great quality will buy agian
B00LXK08PS|5|Fits very nicely. Looks good on my recently painted black ('91) Miata. It comes with its own wiring harness and bulbs which is a great bonus!
B0009IK8CI|5|I have bought cheap blades at drugstores, they don't work well.  This one is truly quality, easy to install and it works better than any wiper blade I have ever purchased.  The price is low for such a great product.
B000JKLGU4|5|Fit perfectly, comes in two pieces to make installation easier.<br />Does not come with a clamp, but I welded the joint together. Also does not come with hangers, but I made my own out of 3/8&#34; bar stock I got at the local hardware store. All in all, a great part if you don't mind a little fabrication to finish the install.
B0082365AQ|5|Worked well this weekend with our 3 person canoe... Just have to make sure you have canoe on there right! Good deal and small to take with you.
B0073MFVGQ|5|Works awesomely! My mechanic installed it and now my fan does not need to turn on while idling. Keeps everything nice and cool.
B009O11PSC|1|I just received the muffler and it looks like something you would put on a tractor not a custom build I will never order from this company again what a waste of money
B00CQKH51O|5|Exactly what we needed!
B0067LE31S|5|My uncle has a motorcar and love decorating it with special accessories. I bought this for his birthday last month! He love it a lot!!
B006P0WOVC|5|Seems to perform just fine in our 03 Honda Civic hybrid, at a very reasonable price!
B005BD3UNA|3|Love this product but I didn't know that I buy only one and not a set of rotor.  But over I got the product in time and return the product and got my money with no problem.
B0056AAL8A|5|great quality, exactly what i expected.
B00L9VWAUC|5|Fast shipping, great quality parts..fixed my problem..Will do business with them again
B005DX6BRK|5|I installed these on my Daughters  2011 Kia Soul, which did not come with drl. Now she can be seen!  Safer than before.
B00480BWCI|1|The second time we used these leveling blocks, three of them became misshapen from the weight of our RV (only a 24 foot Class B+, so not particularly heavy as RV's go).
B000276B2C|5|I like saving a few bucks ordering filters online.  this one was a perfect for for my bike.  I would recommend.
B00RDMBTNA|5|I waited to post this review, because I wanted to use it a few time, and wow these Mits work great. They are comfy and durable, for the price it's a great deal and product. Will buy again when needed.
B000CC0HZ4|4|This thing works like it should and would recommend to anyone that needs one. My only complaint is that it slides on the handles. I had to add some tape to keep them from sliding. Maybe I'm easily annoyed but the slight sling noise this thing make while braking and accelerating was getting annoying.
B00J1NFQRE|2|Received the bulb with poor packaging (no box). No instruction attached. I tried to install on my accord and it did not working. I really regret it. I will not buy again from this seller. Such a waste of my money.
B00D3YEGO6|5|great gift package and fast delivery
B00AFRJ1B2|5|Purchase as a replacement for filter on an Airforce One intake.  AirForce One intakes are next to impossible to find for sale.  This filter is almost an exact replacemenr for the original the only difference is the color.  The original filter was blue.  And the price was right.
B009AQS4IU|4|Very nice but does not fit on my Saturn. I will keep it for my next car.
B000N8GOTU|4|I purchased this for my wife's 56 Nomad as I'm installing a Tuned Port Injected 305 and the factory wiring harness and computer I had was in pretty bad shape. I did quite a bit of research before purchasing, and found it difficult to get much technical information from the manufacturer. I downloaded the manual and it was strictly limited to installation instructions. When I called their \\"tech\\" line a couple times asking some common questions such as requirements for VSS, EGR, park/neutral circuits I was told I would have to talk to one of their engineers. I tried a couple times to reach one but they were never in and I eventually gave up. Their \\"tech\\" assured me they have sold a lot of these and they work fine regardless. Fortunately I know more than most about fuel injection systems and took a leap of faith as mostly they have a good reputation for quality products. The simplicity of this will actually work well for this project as I have limited room for the electronics and wiring that the factory harness would have required. What they dont tell you is this is a Delphi Marine computer and wiring plan that eliminates the cold start injector, vehicle speed sensor, park/neutral, fan control, and EGR. Also, you cant use your OBDI or II scanner and will have to settle for the Check Engine Light flashing codes for diagnostics or spend the $125 for their laptop software and cable. While I'm not yet finished with the install, I can see from what I have so far this will be fine for me. Just be aware of the limitations if you are putting in any car that will need to pass smog tests with all factory emissions controls.
B000XBCURW|5|By far the best protectant I've ever used.  Works great on interior vinyl.  Really does repel dust.  &#34;....  ...... ......
B003PJHBQO|3|The hitch is nice but installing it was challenging because there were only 2 wire bolt-holders used to fish the bolts through the chassis instead of 4 which would have made the installation 1000% easier. When you get the bolts in place and remove the wire fish line to do the other side, it's extremely easy to bump the bolts against the hitch as you raise it up and push the bolts back into the chassis frame rail. If the kit had included 4 wires instead of 2, this would have been a 5 star rating for sure. Drilling as indicated in the instructions was not hard. What WAS hard was to keep the bolts in place as you balance the hitch and raise it up to the frame without pushing the bolts back up.
B001PRV8YO|1|Don't do it.  All the things other people complained about were accurate.  Too thick, doesn't fit, stinks.  Wasted my money.
B0011N17KC|5|its cute, you'll turn some heads on the road, just don't forget you have these on your car, don't open the window while the car is moving, it will blow off.
B00CMW1NVE|1|Did not fit a '02 Crown Victoria as specified on Amazon.  Item picture looks the same as the one on vehicle but an additional view of the product from another angle would have shown it is missing a port for a vacuum hose on the other side.
B001AZH6H4|5|Item allows you to carry bags easily, those ones that you need to having them without move. Very functional to organice things into the car.
B000LQ9YEG|5|I bought the battery to replace one in a large spotlight.  I ordered it based on the dimensions published by the seller.  The battery fit perfectly into my flashlight.  It seems to hold a charge as expected.
B000GQA8DC|5|We tied it in with the middle seat belt and now the kids have their own console, too.  The CD/cassette slotted compartment is rather limited, as well as outdated.  Otherwise, this console is perfect for us.
B00CUREA5C|5|This Amazing Towel is not just for drying your car. It does an excellent job drying cars and also works great to dry your shower walls after you take a shower. It absorbs water quickly and can easily be washed and left to dry for your next project. Try it on your windows and you will be happy you did. I will be buying more for endless cleaning projects around the house. Thanks Vehicular Technologies for your great product.
B00AW09NDI|1|I purchase the cover set 6 months back. With in 4 months, my front seat cover torn into two parts. The quality of material is low graded. I will not recommend to anyone. DON'T BUY. The product says the size is universal but it is not....
B0002KR88A|5|Perfect for underhood weather-resistant power connections directly to the battery.  These fuseholders are the perfect alternative to using glass tube fuses which are much more delicate and more prone to breakage.
B000NVW1LM|1|I pour the 205 in the morning let it run 4 hour. After 4 hour is still leak.i have bad luck trying everything in the market just thinking it would work. may be work on transmission but not on engine.to solve the problem just do it the right way first time and fix it right.take it from someone who buy everything on the market.this was last product i will ever buy.
B004V6QB9I|1|I cant believe I paid 40,00 for this useless thing.  When I exit, it comes with me.  When I enter, the only way to position it properly on my butt is to grab both handles, hold it onto my rear and sit down.  I cant even imagine what to do with it.  Maybe use it as a slider to move furniture.  Maybe as a seat at the stadium, or a boat seat!  Quite possibly I am doing something wrong, but I cant imagine.  The only parts involved are the handles, the pad itself, and my butt. Threw out the package so dont think I can return
B002XYT2HI|5|great product
B0024ECCJW|4|Item was easy to install. Does trip the rest on thermostat tho. Unable to find much information and package does not say there is any type of warranty for materials.
B00LU4L7V6|5|Completely satisfied.
B00HE67XLW|5|This is a great match. I had a few scratches and this blended the colors really well. Now because I touch it up I know where the touch up was and could point it out but from about 2 to 3 feet away no one can tell. Thanks for helping cover those unsightly scratches.
B000C1EIR8|1|Sorry to say but this product failed. After driving 18 miles I got home and could not restart  the engine, I removed it and found that it had failed. Installed a new Aie Control Valve and it works fine.  I sent the failed item back to the seller and was sent refund.
B007CPLINY|1|I've had to replace all the bulbs and it still doesn't work...and just found out I only had 30 days to return...Amazon must know these don't work so they don't guarantee them...should be at least 6 month.  Now the entire headlamp assembly isn't working.  I guess the price was too good to be true....<br /><br />Ed Miller<br />02/23/14
B000C57KI8|4|Just installed them, seem legit so far. Hardware could have been beafier to aid in installation
B000EDOSME|5|This thing is great.<br /><br />We don't use it every time, but when you do you see how much stuff gets stuck in the tank (we have a clear fitting just after the dump valves).  We used it on our black tank all last season.  It is very powerful and it really helps.<br /><br />I added a quick connect hose connector to the end of this and to the hose we use to flush the tank with.  It's easier to disconnect a hose, if there even is one, at a dump station, than it is to connect a hose from a dump station onto this thing.  Otherwise it's a great product.<br /><br />We got a bigger trailer this year and I'm buying another one for the new trailer.  We may put one on our grey tank too.  We do a lot of hunting and I'm always seeing feathers come through while dumping even when we haven't been hunting in months...
B0088C4PBM|4|Wish it could be secured on the bottom, though. Had to use some sticky rubber feet I had from something else to keep it from rattling.
B009LAV3Y2|5|Simple install works great!
B003CRM9CU|5|This was a little more expensive than regular spray paint, but it bonds very well to the metal, and it supposedly is a little more conductive than regular spray paint.  I used it to touch up a black anodized aluminum intercooler and it did a great job.  Goes on as you would expect from spray paint and dries a nice matte/satin black.
B00G620ZVU|5|great buy and great seller
B000GRY6BQ|5|Fits well,,looks good
B00DVPHE46|4|The glow in the dark does not work very well otherwise this is a great replacement case.<br />Note: All I really wanted was the rubber buttons. I kept my old enclosure in case I want black or this case breaks for some unknown reason.
B00THJ8JFS|5|Thank you
B000BUTD8Y|5|This is do much beret than the vinyl cover that came stock with the camper. It looks great and I can still access the tanks even with the camper end expanded open.
B000VKOD9S|5|Love TYC filters. Saves money, works just as well as Honda brand.<br />I prefer the white TYC media to some of the others which have a grey speckled finish, because you can more easily tell when they need replacing. They're less costly too.
B000BQWW7M|5|I keep this in my console to occasionally wipe film off the inside of the windshield. Works well for that purpose.
B00HE6CI58|5|Bright, fit, and no complaints.
B0002MA8TE|5|I researched this carrier before I bought it from Amazon. <br />When it arrived at my house, I noticed that the whole thing is like a rubber material. And it does not leak at all.
B008C0WRJ2|5|It's like they molded it to the car. Once installed it allows virtually no light through the windshield. Have been using it for almost 6 months and have no complaints.
B00CIXID2Y|5|Perfect fit, looks like stock. A bit tricky to install the front ones, but I'm very happy with them.
B004VSEISC|1|I ORDERED CLEAN CAR AND GOT NU CAR<br /><br />Wonder Wafers 200CT Unwrapped Clean Car Air Fresheners, Professional Use<br /><br />Wonder Wafers International
B00J5BGP9U|4|Just what I needed. Will serve two purposes. Covering a hole in the dad pad (that is no longer made) and putting my gauges in a better line of sight.
B0009VIQ1A|5|I have been using these for years and they work great.  They DO NOT scratch you car people just need to make sure to barely touch the surface.  It doesn't clean a car, just pulls dust that settles on the car while being outside.  I have one from 4 years ago that is still going strong on my daily driver.
B000C9HWQE|5|Exact fit for 2003 GMC Envoy with 4.2L in-line 6 cylinder engine (before/pre-catalytic converter).
B002FYFD74|4|Works good!
B005345EEK|5|This is a very comfortable balaclava. The seem is not uncomfortable at all, which I noticed others complain about on reviews for similar products before I purchased this one. I don't even notice it. Fits nicely and is long enough to cover my neck completely.
B000P6UNHE|5|As other reviewers had noted, this is much safer than using a traditional tap or die to repair threads.  I had cross-threaded a bolt on the rear of a cylinder head, after re-assembling the engine.  There was very little clearance between the read of the head the firewall, and I was sorrowful at the idea of undoing all of that work in order to repair the threads.  Then I found this tool set. I was a bit skeptical, wondering how well this would work when the first 2-3 threads of the bolt hole were damaged, but, this 're-rolled' them into allignment with the undamaged threads near the bottom of the hole.  The restored threads held torque beyond the recommended torque.<br /><br />The external thread repair dies and file came in handy as well, allowing me to restore specialty bolts in the belt tensioners, saving me a trip to the dealership or scrap-yard.  The set paid for itself in its first day of use.
B00KLEMC1A|5|First one was delivered damaged. Damage appeared to be from shipper. It was an easy return and the new undamaged one arrived in two days. Excellent brake control and just as advertized its plug and play.  Very easy install and set up. Highly recommend this controller
B005R6R6DG|5|Worked great-no odor!
B0000AX7ER|3|As its name implies this is for dent pulling. For transporting glass windows the HOD , handle-on-demand, on Amazon is the instrument of choice, because extra stable/providing maneuverability. This suction cup for dent pulling has a valve in the middle which allows easier removal of the cup ( just pull on it). That valve is not a push-vacuum pump unlike other suction cups. I have not used it for dent pulling yet ; its suction is very strong though. I surmise I could use it to lift and better fit slabs of marble, granite or quartz during installation on floors/counters, etc.
B003YBRM76|5|it was just what i was  looking for very nice sound
B000N5XVAI|5|worked as described. good packaging. easy to install. new in box. good part for affordable price. solved some issues with my idle.
B006AAKHE8|5|We use them on my son's car in the Netherlands and it is perfect . A lot of people do not know what they are so it's so nice that we are able to make a difference for our son him being so far away from the USA  thanks!!
B000MU8XHK|5|as expected
B00MQ2QX8I|5|Make sure to prep first before applying. This decal is awesome and gets some great nods from fellow Chicago Bulls fans
B0097JQ2MA|5|Do yourself a favor.  Take 15 minutes and take out your seats and your center console.  Installation will be much easier.  Excellent fit. Outstanding instructions. Seem to be very high quality. Very happy.
B000OUZVK0|2|This low profile jack is certainly low enough, and it has a nice extended reach to get into deeper placed under the car/truck, but I have some issues now that mine finally gave out..... 3 months after i started using it (maybe lifted a car 10-15 times with it in that time.<br /><br />It was always leaking fluid (presumably hydraulic fluid, now that i see the real problem), and I noticed it was especially leaky today.  After having my truck up on jacks, i went to lift the front up and take the jacks off... well all of the sudden this thing starts spewing out huge amounts of this fluid and not lifting anything.<br /><br />guess I'll see if the manufacturer will fix this for me.... cause it's done.
B002UZZQ8E|4|Works as intended.  Not sure what else to say.  My radio still works so I am happy and I'd buy it again if I needed it
B00DBEO8Q4|4|ok
B000JZB6IG|5|Fit on my 89 CRX Si. just make sure you tighten the self-locking bolts all the way before you hook it up to the chassis. Save yourself a crap ton of hassle.
B004CGP0N0|4|I love the fairing.  Would have come a bit more easy if there were install instructions and some required hardware.  Very happy with purchase all in all and they look great!
B0049E4VJO|5|The only thing is the thing &#34;jumps&#34; when it snaps the rivet and since you are pushing against the bulkhead to keep the rivet head flush, this tends to make it skip across the bulkhead when it jumps. This can score a painted surface, so I suggest covering the painted surface at a radius of 1-2&#34; to prevent marring incidental to operations.
B003TL5G4W|4|I bought the set of 9 because I needed 8 (for 2 bikes) and they didn't sell just 8 so that's OK I have a spare.<br />The price was good and shipping was quick.<br />When they arrived they were of very good quality but I could not believe that there were no bolts.<br />That small detail adds another $60.00 to the to the total.<br />That would have been nice to know up front I probably would have bought something else.
B001TJ51LY|4|Instalación
B00092CP1G|5|Right tool
B00TGNQ5VA|5|Nice, very good...
B003TKRZ7Y|5|instructions could add a couple pictures on were they expect you to mount it but i figured it out.
B0040CVX8C|5|Cannot drive with out this fuel line clip (:
B000GU24HG|5|Love it works well. Well made
B00BF0WBX8|5|Good
B000C7YRNM|3|GOOD PART, SHIPPING TIME AND ECELENTE PACKAGE. FOR LONG LIFE USE AND THE SAME OF THE ORIGINAL PART OF JAPANESE GENUINE PARTS, STANT IS A GOOD PART. THIS PART IS FOR A 2005 SUZUKI AERIO SX 2.3L. IT IS THE BEST IN THE MARKET FOR CARS AND LIGHTWEIGHT TRUCKS.  ARE ALSO AN EXCELLENT REPLACEMENT PARTS FOR CAR OF OTHER BRANDS.
B006EGAIJ2|5|I'm not sure why I never bought these a long time ago. These ramps are excellent, strong, wide, and provided enough lift to work under the vehicle. I also like the thick rubber grip at the beginning of the ramps.<br />Used for lifting a Nissan Murano.
B00D8Y71ZM|5|Great, thanks A+
B002TV1X4K|5|I have been looking every where for these fog lights to fit my 1996 Dodge Dakota,they work well and look good.<br />I keep telling everyone Amazon.com has it.I am so happy i can see again.
B0001XPC0E|4|My husband had been looking for this item for quite some time. It was what he wanted. He likes having it to write notes on.
B002L7HAH6|5|As Described!
B000E8INYI|5|I purchased these to help me get into my lifted Jeep Wrangler.  Love them!
B0012UK3M2|4|Does their job
B00004U2J8|5|This sounds a little complicated so bare with me.. magic the gathering is a great game! I suggest people who are new (duh) buy the starter pack.. it teaches you to play the game and helps you with comprehension(other word makes you think hard, but not very hard or your brain would pop.) When you think you masterd the starter go out and buy the advanced card and/or expert cards to add to your starter deck.. the more you play the harder the game gets and the more fun you have! its a little complicated at first but you get used to using your brain.. :-P<BR>....
B00DGYHE1U|4|THIS IS THE SECOND  ONE I  GOT  SAY NO MORE
B001D5A4MA|5|The wipers installed easily after some difficulty removing the old wipers.  The blades clear the windshield completely and silently.
B0083LDD4S|5|worked very well great product
B00V5MV006|5|Product worked properly and came in really fast thanks soo much
B006LO5VWQ|5|This battery arrived fast at a great price and months later it starts like new.  I would buy another and from this seller again.  It fit perfect and no problems.  Spins it over nicely and strength for running things when the bike os off too. I have an 07 with no charging problems.  I left something on for weeks and this is why I had to buy a new one.
B00SUNH7GY|5|First off, let me discuss the shipping. This product arrived in less then 3 days. It shipped from California and I live in Oklahoma, which is a heck of a lot faster then most things reach me. The lights were well packaged and neatly placed in individual boxes to keep everything together. Have zero complaints on shipping.<br /><br />Second I'll discuss the lights themselves. I'll be honest, for the price I was really sketched out on just how well they would function and look but they turned out way beyond my expectations! I took a great deal of time figuring out just how I wanted the lights positioned and what I wanted the glow affect on. I set it up just the way I wanted as I have never seen a led kit that was so user friendly and convientant. I have installed LED floor well lights before and it was a nightmare figuring out where and how to tie everything into power and ground. This system is completely plug and play. Which I loved. The control/receiver box also is sound activated which... On my motorcycle doesn't get used at all. But I will be buying another set for my f-150 pickup to replace the static blue ones I have. The remotes that come with this set work flawlessly for me as well too. I used Velcro to attach the large remote under my passenger seat and the smaller less functional remote I keep on my key ring. I will post pictures of my bike here for you to see. And yes... It's in my kitchen due to weather and it was just easier to work on. I have gotten tons of compliments on my bike and like I said, I plan on getting another set for my vehicle.<br /><br />Only complaint I have is that the adhesive strips don't seem sticky enough. Granted I never tried to ride it with just the products adhesive alone... But I just didn't trust it. So I glued and stuck them on with my own product of choice. I simply just applied my adhesive to theirs and stuck It to the bike. I don't worry about residue because due to it being LED... The lights will far outlast my bike in ride time or I'll sell it and it won't matter anyway. This is just a really cheap and awesome way to add some character to your vehicle. I recommend this product 100%. I'll post these pictures now.<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />-Bobby
B000BY6HCA|5|great fit and looks good
B0045K2Q9Y|4|wrong fuse order, other then that you can't beat the price
B000EJV5N8|2|I love the tire guage and how quickly it inflates tires for how small it is.  I use it for the bikes every spring.  It did start my mom's Camry once.  I charged it to 3 lights, let it charge for two more hours, and it was still on 3. I tried to start the car, thoroughly. No start. I let it charge for 3 more hours: it went from 2 lights to 3. I tried it again. CICKLICKLICKLICK. Had to use my mom's Camry to jump start properly.  I also had another B&D unit (older, no lighter outlet) not take a charge after 5 uses and two years (I kept/keep it at 60-80% charge for storage). Frankly, I won't buy another B&D for emergency starts. It's cheaper to park at the top of a hill.
B00B9W4HDO|4|Its best i used in 10 years on my leather car seats
B00S77O7ZC|5|Love it
B007BEYIS8|4|fits my swingarm on my suzuki tl 1000s  as advertised shipped fast usps seems to be good quality specialty tool  wish it would have been a little cheaper in price  but I needed this tool  having the right tool for the job  is always soooo much easier
B000C9QFDK|5|works great
B0002J22AU|5|This is a great product! So simple and easy to install and program. Just take care, the IR LED is a bit fragile so don't force it.
B0034ZUZM6|5|Great
B001KSCF0O|4|My original mirror cracked.  This replacement did what I needed it to do.  Of course the original was better quality but this mirror was not bad at all.
B0006HNSGK|2|rear shock is not designed as oem..it was very difficult to install... the buttom of the strut was wider than oem..and will not easily fit in the opening..it will, but with difficulty.
B0047S1TS8|5|high quality great product easy to install as long as you don't need written instructions.
B0067EHI5S|4|Fit great and look great.  Thank you to all those that replied to my question. I really appreciate it!
B00BCQM4Y6|5|Its a sticker. It was sticky, and did what it was suppose to do. plus it says Harley Davidson on it. Enough said.
B004YBYL1K|5|My husband got these HMK BOA boots for Christmas and they are the best snowmobiling boots he has ever owned! We love all thing HMK in our family! My husband is a crazy snowmobiler that gets out there as much as he can! He said this boots were great to move around in, plus kept is feet warm with being out there for 6 hours or more on a sled day!<br />I will be purchasing a pair for myself for next years sledding season for sure!
B005N53CBQ|2|We misunderstood the title &#34;standard bench seat&#34;.  We purchased for a back seat but it is for a front seat.
B004JHBKLS|5|It fits and the quality is very high.  I see no reason to pay more elsewhere.  This is not my first one, I have used them before with no issues.
B00SMH58RI|5|They work excellent
B001RBCU90|3|A lot bigger than expected..
B00480J55E|4|GOt these for my Girlfriend's Civic after months of complaining of dim headlights at night. I installed these myself and must say they are well worth the price and install time. They throw a considerably longer and brighter beam at night compared to the stocks. The street signs are now visible for blocks ahead. They are not the &#34;brightest&#34; but you will notice a difference if you suffer from a low output low beam. I recommend them.
B00BY24LJY|5|Nice shirt!!! Perfect fit!! Size is a true fit!! Good quality material. Don't think twice if you are interested in this shirt!
B00KL3ALGO|5|I actually purchased the seat back protectors and they are great! Much better than the plastic ones I had before that my kids tore down easily. I have leather seats so these seem to be great so far!
B00BITI6Q2|4|Perfect fit
B006R4BQNS|4|expected quality part as OEM. arrive in anticipated time
B0007M309E|3|I ordered two to figure out which one fit my 2014 Jeep. This was too short, so I kept the other.
B0001EXSJA|1|It was to small, wrong one, not nice people
B006JXF9DK|2|I ordered 2 for both of my cars, a 2004 R32 and a 2000 GTi. It ended up having to buy different antenna's because these have poor fit with the weather sealing O-Ring and there is not enough threads to use the included nut. I ended up cross threading one of the antennas and the other i was tightning it and it stripped the threads. Almost couldnt get it off.  Both are trashed and i ended up buying new replacement stock antenna masts which work perfect.
B00C8YXGB6|2|Pain to replace the batteries and the magnets fall out. Get what you pay for.
B006LJ80C4|5|Perfect fit and very easy to instal.
B000CMHVJO|5|PURCHASED EASYLIFT ONLY HOPING IT WOULD HELP ME TO LIFT MY HEAVY TAILGATE.WAS I EVER SUPRISED !! I CANT BELIEVE HOW WELL THIS PRODUCT WORKS.I CAN NOW OPEN AND CLOSE MY TAILGATE WITH ONE HAND. MY WIFE CAN ALSO OPERATE THE GATE WITHOUT ANY HELP.GREAT PRODUCT.WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE.ALSO BE SURE TO HAVE HELP INSTALLING. HARRY
B0082JX4ZY|5|I replaced my factory belt on my 2010 Kawasaki Brute Force 750 after 200 hard working hours. The belt light turns on at the 100hr mark but I knew she was a ways away from being ready to change. Never any slipping at all.  When I did change the belt the new gates belt went on easy and is a perfect replacement. I have put 11 hours on the new belt and it works like it should. And you just can't beat the price. I will wait to for a few more hours and just buy another to hang in the shed.
B00FG2MZXM|5|arrived and worked perfect - very slooooow shipping - 5 days late
B00AO4Y0L2|4|I got this pack of bulbs to replace those in both my 2007 Xterra and 2011 Legacy. They fit well in both vehicles however with not much room to spare. They are BRIGHT and it's almost a hazard turning them all on at once if it's dark out. The bulbs DO have a polarity so if it doesn't work turn it around. Also, like others have stated, there are 3 rows in between the ends and 4 wide.
B00341MIAW|5|Great little product.  A little time consuming to use and get right.  You also need a pretty strong drill to make it come out with the fewest fine scratches.<br /><br />I have a Craftsman 19.2V drill and it did not have the rotating power.  Also had a plug in 3500RPM max drill and it did the job.<br /><br />If you have a good drill the lights or clear plastic can/will come out fantastic.  If you only have a decent drill, it will still come out well.  Just not as impressive.<br /><br />All in all, it is worth every penny.
B00B9Z86F6|5|This Grille Emblem was a replacement for one that had fallen off of my Honda.  It looks great and I am pleased with my purchase.
B0002Z9KE0|3|very handy for short people
B000C9TD66|5|great product, worked well
B000F2L6ME|5|My wife has been insisting I get her a dash mat for her 2005 Camry for a long time now. I finally conceded and got her this mat. She installed it herself (meaning installation must have been fairly easy. She is generally terrible at DIY). It actually looks very good and is very well made and was a great price!
B00JIB4GBQ|5|love it
B0055RDLJU|5|Yes, my wife and I are big fans of German Shepherds.  I found this sticker while perusing German Shepherd art on Amazon.com.  We liked the image and thought it would look nice on the side windows of her Fusion.<br /><br />I have to say, NickerStickers does a good job in packaging the stickers so that they would not be damaged during shipping.  Given the quality of the stickers and the rapid service from NickerStickers, I would certainly order from them in the future.
B004YMWDX2|5|My wife loves them. we had them painted slasa red to match the car. I wish they were attached with something better than 3m tape. but a good product.
B004TADG7Q|4|Bumper end caps fit my 2006 Wrangler perfectly. However, not they do not come with the mounting hardware. So you will need to reuse the screws and clips from your bumper extensions if you still have them. Look great on the Jeep.
B004IV8NBU|1|Broke after two days
B0016LAL9W|5|didn't last long but worked great
B007TYBCFM|5|Amazeballs is all I have to say...
B000VKRQDI|5|they fit they work keeps my car fresh you would be surprised how much stuff these catch.
B001HMJR7C|4|Shipping was on time, packaged from magnaflow. Was high quality as expected from magnaflow. With this cat you'll definitely be welding, It's everything it says it is! I was re welding stock pipe so I could use it for emissions. Passed with room to spare and sounded suprisingly grisly. I'm used to dumps but that was... Unexpected!<br />Thanks amazon and magnaflow<br />CP
B000C9SRD6|5|Great fit and function as original. Lower price than parts store and way better quality! Why buy aftermarket when you can have dealer replacement for less $$$$
B0016ZGUS4|5|Buying the set is already a way better value than buying everything separately. On top of that Amazon discounts the price even more. I bought this set for my 2002 Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD 6.0L. I had an oil leak from what I though was the back of the cylinder heads. I removed the heads and had them shaved flat and cleaned. This set includes everything needed when tearing down the top end of the engine. For some reason it is very hard to find a detailed list of what is actually included in this set. I've listed everything that I can remember. Most of the parts are not labeled so I had no idea where a lot of the gaskets/seals went until I was taking the engine apart. Work slowly and you will see where the replacement gaskets/seals go and just swap them out when reassembling the engine.<br /><br />Included:<br />Valve Stem Seals - Intake(x8)<br />Valve Stem Seals - Exhaust(x8)<br />EGR gasket(x1)<br />EGR pipe/tube gasket(x1)<br />Thermostat gasket(x1)<br />Throttle Body Mounting gasket(x1)<br />Fuel Injector O-rings<br />Fuel Rail O-rings<br />Exhaust Flange seals/rings(x2)<br />Intake Manifold gaskets(x2)<br />Cylinder Head gaskets(x2)<br />Air Bleed Pipe seal(x1)<br />Valley Pan gasket(x1)<br />Knock Sensor Grommets(x2)<br />Valve Cover gaskets(x2)<br />Exhaust manifold gaskets(x2)<br /><br />I think there are a couple of gaskets that I left off the list but I can't remember for sure. Everything pictured came in the set and went somewhere on my truck when I put it back together.
B005E8MVJQ|5|This is an excellent product,  Maybe the best of any method,  As all caps are worthless, from my reading up, caps provide maybe a half sec of juice only if the voltage drops and most time load the system.  This battery type DOES NOT load the car system, and truly provides necessary power when needed,  BUT I should have gone for one size bigger,   but the price was too good, and the terminals are super easy to connect to.  whatch out as the dam package bubble burst and my unit was improperly packaged. For the weight.
B00310Z3VM|5|Throw it on and Go !
B001QK1X5O|5|I purchased this lock for a small kayak trailer. I drove around locally and I was not able to find a lock like this. As usual amazon carries exactly what I need. It works as advertised. As the pictures attached show there a small sleeve that can be used to fit different trailers. I ended up buying a couple of washers to cover small gaps, just for added security. Keys are sturdy and it comes with 2.
B006MM3R32|5|WORKS ON RZR 4 800
B008Y8WY8G|5|Fits and works perfect on my 2005 chevy colorado crew cab. It comes with the bulb ready to plug in.
B00BVB5V0Q|5|arrived on time, easy to install, and very inexpensive....So far works great, im very happy with this purchase.  if I had to complain about anything it would be that it was more of a faded black color than actual black, but that's just being picky,  5 stars for this product...
B000HBNV58|5|My house is well made, but two of the interior doors were squeaking intolerably.  So I took the hinge pins out and applied lithium grease.  Squeaks vanished instantly and permanently, but the doors moved so freely that they kept swinging closed unless restrained.  I have used every construction tool I can find to determine in what way the house is not level, square, and plumb.  could not find any deviation from perfection.  whatever deviation the house has can't be measured by ordinary instruments, but these doors know it's ther than the re, and now I use a wastebasket to prop each open.  Still, it's better than the squeaks.
B00387ZP6G|5|Replaced this part on my car along with new rear tires.  Car handles great.  Easy to install had no problems.
B0040CZ3E2|4|The parts were actually used for a fender liner on a 2000 Saturn. They seem to fit and work fine.
B001O0VRAW|5|Good price, and quick shipping.
B00HPZG6H4|5|Fit like a glove, didn't need to take anything apart was a 5 sec. plug & play. Just didn't like that Amazon toke 4 days to ship then another 5 days to get here.
B001JSXAYU|5|This helmet is comfortable and vents fairly well when you get up to speed. Sure it's not as nice as other more expensive helmets, but you're paying under $100. For such a low price you get a very nice helmet. Some people complain about the noise but come on, you're riding a motorcycle, it's noisy. Perfect for low budgets, passenger helmet, or your first helmet. DOT approved and under $100, can't beat that.
B00BUPB44K|5|This is what should come with the car.  It comes with everything as if it came from the factory already in the car.  It evens comes with the door jam replacement stickers that show the correct PSI for all 5 tires on the car.
B0051D3MP6|5|great price for a simple, compact unit. I've used it all winter to keep the battery on my motorcycle topped up.
B005FRBKVG|1|first they didnt fit the back seat but did fit front so they gave me 40%credit to keep the covers now the front covers are coming apart at the seams now i have to buy more so it cost me money to deal with these people
B001LA1E7G|5|I love it because it is the Cure! Red is the perfect color for my silver car. Should last a long time.
B001GDJGJQ|5|I was so unorganized in my car before I got this.  Everything that I would put on the seat eventually ended up on the floor.  Not anymore!  I don't use the &#34;hidden&#34; part as such because I like to keep a box or Kleenex in there.  I also keep my insulated water bottle, pen, pad, sunglasses, makeup mirror, fold up rainboots, window breaker for emergencies, and a canister of window wipes to clean off my dog's nose prints all inside of this one organizer!  It doesn't slide around on my leather bucket seat.  I am SO happy I got this.  It has helped me so much! 😀
B009M1L5NO|5|Use in my Commercial mowers and engines run cooler. Great product!
B0089XOHYU|4|Since I live in Western New Yorker where is snows 8 months out of the year and rains the rest it is a great idea to water proof my boot.s I was excited this came with a puff to help apply to my boots. I got this on a promotional price and am so happy with my purchase!
B00CODCAZ4|5|Excellent. Love this vest.. Fits perfectly..
B004XNQLB2|4|This was a good product. It fix most of the wholes in my camper, but it didn't stick well to some of them. It's good for smaller holes.
B00CUIL180|5|I always hated duck faces and this decal expresses that for me. Looks Awesome on my car =) If you want to customize this don't be shy 2 Loose Screws have all their screws and are amazing with any request you might have. Even if you might want it bigger =)
B004CP40LE|5|The headlight brightness is the same as with the original bulbs.  It takes a bit of time to install it yourself, but it's definitely worth it.
B001LHVOVK|5|I use this thing all the time. I love it. Nice and simple and it gives me the code I need and I can look in up online. Very nice to have around the house.
B008X0327W|2|I purchased a set of these in the Fall of 2013 to replace the stock set on my 2008 Mazda 3 after one had gone bad. Initially I was satisfied, but over the past month I've noticed that one side has gotten quite noisy in jounce, which is very apparent now that we're thawing out and there are more bumps on the road. The other side had the top bearing plate go bad, causing a nasty-sounding, though mostly harmless scrape when the spring binds up during sharp steering (the bearing normally allows the spring to spin so that doesn't happen).<br /><br />While this assembly seemed like a good value when I purchased them, the durability is not there and I'll be replacing them after only 6000 miles of use.
B000NBKI7Q|5|This is truly a fix for your belt that squeals and for your belt that slips off the pulleys when it gets wet.  No squeal as soon as I started the engine after installing this belt and kit.  I have also driven through several large puddles while it was raining just today and no slipping off of the pulleys as it has done in the past.      I do have some advice for you if (and you should) buy this kit.          1.  Take the time to straighten out the belt.  It is packed in a small box and it is twisted quite a bit when you get it.  Take the time to lay it out and straighten it so it is easier to install.         2. Try and remove the tensioner pulley from under your car if you can get it jacked up high enough.  some people have been removing the alternator and other parts but it is not necessary.  If you have a long extension and an elbow for you ratchet set you can access the nut that keeps the tensioner pulley in place.  You will have to get past the front axle and slightly behind the engine but it is accessible from under the car.  If you can't get it jacked up, you will have to go in from above.      3. Get a friend to help.  The belt is smaller than the OEM and it is nearly impossible to put it on yourself without help.  You can do the \\"stepping on the belt wrapped to a wrench attached to the tensioner method\\" but just get a friend to pull back on the tensioner while you put on the belt.  Much easier.      4. Follow the directions.  It says to put it on all the wheels and pulleys except the idler pully.  You are to slip it under the idler pulley last while spinning the idler clockwise.  Do exactly that.  With the the help of a friend pulling on the tensioner, I put the belt under the idler in less that 10 seconds.  It was tight and good to go.    If you have a Plymouth Grand Voyager or sister model that has a belt that comes off in the rain or is squealing to no end, get this product.  It is well worth the money and peace of mind.      FYI.. My car was a 2000 Plymouth Grand Voyager with the 3.3 V6 Flex Fuel engine.
B00407RSCM|2|Confusing descriptions and I got a color that does not match my truck.  The color is purple grey pearl metallic.  Can't find any.
B00AHJZBCG|5|This is a great spotlight!<br /><br />High intensity LED beam that covers our entire property to track our two black labs. Lightweight and long-lasting charge.
B00HJ1592C|4|As expected! The jewels start to fall off right away, but it's cute still!
B000AP6RFM|5|Not yet available in stores.  It is the correct application for my car and I'm pleased with my purchase.

B00NA4TJSC|5|This is the only chain lube I use
B00061SMOE|5|Best bar on the market for the money
B00KTIR1ZU|5|After programming by my Chevy dealer (for which I was not charged; thank you dealer), these work perfectly.  Compare the very reasonable cost of these to the $100 plus charge made by Chevy dealers and you can see why buying these is a no-brainer.
B000C7X25Q|4|Nice replacement for a reasonable price. Replaced gas tank same time with fuel pump, top straps and filler neck. I did prime and paint the exterior of the tank just to slow down the rust in the future. Seemed close to the factory gauge thickness, fit real nice.
B0013JDW5M|1|Lights don't have a size and they didn't come with a alcohol wipe Like it says they did let me return it
B00VAGA2EW|5|easy to hook up, works as it should. it is not back light and hard to read in low light conditions.
B000EJ6QNM|4|Pads work great on my 06 Acura TL.  I have had them installed for about 1500 miles.  I have noticed some noise after the brakes are heated up at initial brake grab, mostly at low speeds.  I have tried cleaning the brakes a couple of times hoping that would stop the noise but no luck yet.  I had this same type of pad on an 09 Civic and they were great, no noise at all.  That was why I got them for my TL.  I'm not giving up yet.
B004V9BQEA|4|Both my wife and I have these on our seat belts, hers is natural sheepskin color and mine is black. They are very comfy, especially in the summer when the seat belt would touch the skin directly.  I just wish the velcro area would be made a little wider so one could wrap the thing around the belt a little tighter.
B000E4IHUC|2|At first I thought these were a decent product at a good price.  I understand that they are not OEM but it is really about quality.  The large rubber \\"studs\\" used to attach the product to the vehicle loosened after a few months.  They did not come out, but loosened enough to cause the headlight to bounce around on bumps.  I have taken both left and right out twice now to modify these rubber attachment points.  I managed to tighten them up, but with a slight design change, these would be much better... You get what you pay for, but in this instance these were not cheap...I did like the fact they came with bulbs already installed.
B0009IQZPW|5|this product works for me. i combine this with meguiars #26 and it works awesome. (tip: dont use carnuba wax then wash and seal it in a ziplock bag... apparently because carnuba is banana product it can mold :(  )
B0013LJ4OS|4|Bag is very well constructed.  Rain flap blew off the bag and it would benefit from its own set of attachment straps.  I packed enough for two days without difficulty.
B009EVNC56|5|These fit perfectly onto my car. They are easy to install. Just peel the tape and stick it on. Now I crack the windows of my car on hot days and the heat escapes out the crack. Caution: by purchasing these vents, you will not be guaranteed success in life, but you will do much better than losers that don't have these vents.
B0017K69MA|3|I have been using Stoner's Invisible Glass and a microfiber towel to clean my automotive glass for several years now, and I always get a clear, streak-free shine.  I watched the online video for the Reach and Clean Tool and was sold on being able to clean the inside of a my deeply sloped windshield.  The tool performs exactly as advertised. What the video does not show, however, is how difficult it is to change the included cloths for different purposes.  Removing one and installing another can easily take one or two minutes and requires three hands.  Also, the plastic head unsnaps from the handle much too easily, so that I often have to reassemble the entire device each time I also need to replace the cleaning cloth.  Frankly, I see no reason why the head should ever have to removed, and it would be wise of the manufacturer to redesign the tool so that it cannot accidentally come apart.  Would I recommend the tool?  Only to those who want a perfectly clean windshield but are willing to spend a lot of time to get it.
B00180N0I0|5|FIXT AND WORK LIKE IT  WAS THE  ORIGINAL BEST OF ALL CHEAP!!!!! DELIVERY ON TIME I RECOMEND IT { BEFORE SPEND TOO MUCH TRY BOSAL}
B000K3IDS8|5|I got a big size (XL)because it was cheaper .<br />It still cooled nicely even though it did not fit snug. I think because I wear Nomex underwear under my racing suit so it insulates  the cold very well .
B0051D3MP6|5|Super well designed and much better price than Battery Tender equivalent.  Works great keeping battery charged on classic car that is down in the garage for the winter.<br /><br />Great, well made, accessories.  All the bits in the box for every configuration.  Very slick and not the retro 1970s design of the Battery Tender version .... and less money.  Very happy with it in operation.
B00EGDUR7S|4|Exactly what I was looking for.....and glad it came with directions too! Looked at a few websites...glad I found this one on Amazon..
B00FSAV5LU|4|Does what it's entailed.
B005CLQ3RQ|4|Great product for the price and easy to install.  Just remember that this is a knock-off and not a Toyota part.  Works very well and would order other items if needed for the same truck.
B001E2IUXM|4|These rope cleats work very well and are very quick to tie off to.  I use mine for both anchor cleats as well as docking cleats.  I positioned one on each corner of my jon boat.<br />Only reason I gave them a 4 instead of a 5 is that the finish is not completely even but for the price I am not complaining.  I ended up just painting over them to match my boat.
B00EPMWP66|5|GREAT
B004AIHDLM|4|Thanks
B006CRT72W|4|Thought the instructions were attached to the remote control, instead i got an online link. Apart from that it was fine
B000CNN2A0|5|Exactly as described. Great sound!
B000BQRQTG|5|works great, perfect fit.<br />Picture is incorrect.<br />This is for the cargo area when you have the third row seat up.
B004ZF4L2O|5|This product is good as it can get.everything as it describe.
B00032K938|5|Evidently motorcycle plates are not universally the same size in every state.  This is a full size license plate frame and while I made sure of the size before ordering (I ordered it for my truck not a motorcycle) in reading some of the reviews it became apparent that there were those who were not aware of the size discrepancies.  There is not a lot of chrome on my 2007 Colorado so this addition made a good contrast.  It is a good looking professionally manufactured plate, if you like the style then you can’t go wrong in selecting this plate.
B004L7LZXY|5|The visor was easy to install; found installation video on you tube that helped.  The visor was as genuine Honda as described.  Fast delivery.
B001FIDNGO|3|Button pops off easy - suggest a drop of super glue. other wise works as needed.
B001A6GY3U|5|I used the Nelson Rigg SVT600 on a 6 day trip to the Smokies.  It rained 5 out of 6 days, and all of my gear stayed completely dry (even at highway speeds).  The bags can be used individually or in tandem, which makes them more versatile.  The large bag can hold a ton of stuff, but the small bag...not so much.  I was able to fit my rain suit, a lightweight jacket, and a bath towel in the small bag, but that was a little tight.  It was very easy to strap the bags down to my H-D Road King and take them off every day.  It just took a couple of minutes each time and the bags were quite secure.  I never used the backpack straps because I never had to carry the bags very far, but this is a nice feature to assist in hauling your gear.  I paid $150 for the set and I thought this was a great value for a set of bags that seem to be well-constructed and are very easy to use.
B00EIS7EGI|2|After a very long install I was very pleased with the way these halos look. Super bright, one slightly yellow instead of white, and get looks everywhere. Unfortunately after very limited usage (my garage toy, maybe 100 miles since install)they have already started to burn out. It wouldn't be that big of a problem other than I have to take the front facia off to remove the lights. I have not contacted Oracle yet, but I'm sure they'll replace the product. I just have to find time to start taking my car apart. If they didn't burn out, 5 stars for sure.
B000CINV88|2|Applied to rear disk brake as instructed.  My observation is that the product never really dried into a rubbery film as I expected.  It stayed soft and delicate.  I applied a second time using a hair dryer to speed up curing and had better results, letting the product sit for 30 minutes to dry.  My brakes still squealed as before so for me this was not a solution.<br /><br />I ended up installing new rotors and now have completely quiet brakes.
B0049OI4J2|5|A needed product for my HHr, so the price was good verse others that I have seen online.
B00HMR54NC|5|The round bushing is hard to install if you don't use a little creativity. No you do not have to cut in half, in fact it takes away from the snug feeling this part has. However, it can be a beast to install. I had to make a brace out of wood to install this with a C-clamp. It worked well. However, I spent an hour to install the circle bushing. (No creative inspiration.) I have pictures of the installed part and the contraption I made. I will add them later after I take some pictures. The last person to do work on the bushing killed the treads that hold it on though. I have to get a new bracket later, but the part installed great, and fits snug. The rear bushing was easy to install, but because someone rounded the bolts off, I had to use a extractor to get them out. The bolts that came with this fit well and were easy to finger tighten before applying some torque to them. Overall, this was a good part and nice to replace my completely chopped up front bushing and really worn rear bushing. I just have to wait till I get the new U-Joint bushings before I can comment on the overall stability and the like. This kit was installed on a 96 Subaru Legacy Brighton.
B001C5U9A8|5|very well, fit and work grat!!
B007VYHQLE|5|When other Manufacturers Valve cover gaskets have failed (including Mazda OEM) these have proven to hold up very well and resist leaking extremely well. Only place I still have oil leak is at the Rear CAS of which has its own gasket which I feel is responsible for the continued leak at the CAS.  As such no nearing on the CAM cover sealing. Very impressed with this gasket, and its a gasket, so that says a lot.  ; )  Highly recommend!!  Installed on 1994 Mazda Miata 1.8 NA (SC'd)
B007QBGS9I|5|works great
B00881EQ1C|5|Great
B002IZDM50|5|Used this on a boat city water connection. The old connection was working fine, but i figured after 20 years it made sense to have a new swivel piece. No issues, easy installation and product appears to be of great quality. Price was excellent as well, half of the local marine store.
B003UTH088|5|I bought 2 remotes for my 07 Denali. Took me less than 5 minutes to read the directions and program both remotes.  All functions work perfect.
B009NE0F68|5|i bought one and had to get another because they loved it. i will be  a returning costumer! it is actualy in thier car window!
B0097LX4ZQ|3|it some what looks like HID looking at truck in the truck looking out not like HID i think it's 75 watts
B001UN77O8|1|The sunglasses didn't fit my face so the padded frames are useless. Also there is a choppers logo on the side of the frames that doesn't show up in the picture. Very disappointed but so cheap, not worth dealing with a refund
B000J9Y1T8|5|Worked Good . Easy to program . Easy to install .
B004XESPFG|5|I got this for a friend of mine as a Christmas present and he loves it he always gets complements on it. It looks like it was made with good quality materials not the cheap stuff. Seller is pretty good too got it earlier than expected.
B007P1JNUK|5|We broke a key, so I ordered this, put the little transponder module in it, got it cut for about $30, and it works fine.
B0000BYQ8U|5|Very nice mirror. Bigger than I expected. I guess it helps to read the description better ;-)<br />No Matter, I think it will work great to see anything behind the boat and a pretty good view on each side as well.<br />It comes with adapters to adjust to the thickness of your boat windshield frame. I had to use none of them as my frame is pretty thick.
B005UQEK1O|3|These were are really cute idea, but when they arrived, the colors were so off that they look pretty yucky.  The hat is more of an old red color, while the face is bright pink. Does not go together at all.  I think I will find some cute pink print fabric and cover the hats so that they at least match the face.
B004HV8OYC|3|My only problem was putting back seat cover on because my wife's dodge caliber has headrests in back. Might make slits in them to work better but haven't tried yet.
B00606NJ0G|4|Works well. Arrived as advertised.
B00B7R00GE|5|If you look closely at the photo you will see that the socket drive slips between a collar on the nut and the shaped part of the nut. This collar does two things, it rotates if you grab it from the outside as with big locking pliers, and it prevents one from using an emergency removal kit (spiral socket that threads onto an arbitrary nut) until you cut away the collar. You can of course cut it away with an angle grinder if you do need to use an emergency removal kit. The socket is thin and I wonder if it will hold up to removing a stubborn nut but so far it has held up to my pneumatic wrench.
B005WWGHTO|5|perfect
B004QMYZZ4|5|Bolted right in and works perfectly.
B00CBSP342|5|I like this oil. Kinda pricey, only comes in a gallon unlike the chain stores which sell oil in a 1.25 gallon quantity of other oils on the market. Generally hard to find too.
B00JGJGIKW|5|Well made.  A good length for connecting batteries in series/parallel.
B001KQ9L94|4|I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 only because the part arrived bent. Fortunately I was able to bend back fairly easily with an adjustable wrench.<br /><br />Other than that, I'm really happy with this purchase. I am NOT a car guy, but was able to make this repair in 40 minutes (including breaks to watch the YouTube video). The part was inexpensive, and shipping was fast, and I am stoked about having a functional tailgate again with such little time or money investment. Again, I am NOT a DIY guy, but this is a repair that anyone can make. Way better quality than the original cheap plastic Toyota part.
B009WWSHOS|5|Received the gasket early then expected. Good packaging. Fits like a glove,no need to modify on my b16 head. Looks Good and sturdy
B002R109DS|5|I just purchased a complete set of front lights (4 lights all together) for the front of my 2004 silverado. My old lights were really looking bad and showing their age, and also effecting my vision at night. I've polished out headlights before, but it takes hours of sanding and the haze comes back shortly (within about 4 months). I learned my lesson and just bought new this time. I was skeptical because I've used some reproduction parts in the past with horrible outcomes, but these look like brand new originals.They fit very well and everything lined up great. WILL NEVER TRY TO RESTORE AGAIN!!
B004OZLNE4|3|didnt work well and was more costly than retail.Used for an RV and fiberglass siding.Didnt receive what was posted. I bought RV wash an got GELL GLOSS.ugh!
B00JVHLS3G|3|Was slightly bent
B00005RHQQ|2|***** Listen Up All You Amateurs *****    What you REALLY need, for hours of service on real-world \\"appliances\\" is a \\"bucket of high-Ah SLA's\\" (i.e. high AmpHour SealedLeadAcid batteries) and a separate power inverter (DC to AC power inverter).  This will wind up weighing 200+ pounds, and it is NOT \\"portable\\"...I repeat it is NOT portable unless you have a pet pack mule...    ...this Xantrex-on-wheels is for brewing coffee in the morning, not powering useful devices for hours during a blackout...    ***** Did You Get That? *****    The original review follows---    Continuous power rating is 1350W, not 1500W.  Most units have 3x17Ah=51Ah, not 3x21Ah=63Ah capacity.  Loads approaching the rating will deplete the batteries in a matter of minutes, not hours--better read up on this one at Xantrex's website before getting soaked for $400 thinking you can, e.g., run a normal fridge for hours during a blackout--you can't, and you'll need a \\"noisy generator\\" anyway to recharge this unit and run other loads.    UPDATE:  I have added an extra 53Ah+78Ah SLA (SealedLeadAcid) battery so I can run real-world devices for \\"many\\" hours.  These batteries are HEAVY (100+ pounds total), so forget about a \\"portable backup pack\\" that lives up to the hype at AMAZON etc...    ...btw, the \\"karaoake\\" guy review is total nonsense--his karaoake must be something he uses in a small bathroom where he only entertains himself while he's in the shower.  Try and locate him and get the details and you'll not find him...buyer beware of paid-off testimonials.    ***** Bottom line *****  You'll be out about $3/Ah (you need at least 200Ah = $600) for the external batteries, plus $SeveralHundred for a 2000W inverter, plus a trip to an auto-parts store for the custom-made cables to attach the batteries in parallel to the inverter.
B0024ECDL4|4|Quality, heavy duty.  The on/off are pretty stiff but I'm thinking they'll get easier to turn with time.
B001O07SU0|4|Hope I never have to find out if the bandits can hammer a socket on to these and get 150# of torque on these things. I now live in Mexico where these are a MUST! It's not that they can't be taken off, but how long and how noisy will it be before you get however many you have on each wheel off. I have three lug nuts on each wheel and ordered an extra Key, time will tell what kind of quality this product is. They look good and take the torque.
B00DLXXQIG|4|This is what it looks like, the license place from Ghostbusters.<br /><br />It is made of stamped metal and is as sturdy as a regular license plate.<br /><br />The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was that it needed two holes in the top.  If you will look at the picture, you will see that there are only holes in the bottom, so they weren't false advertising, but be aware of the lack of top holes when you buy.<br /><br />I don't understand why they would only use two bottom holes...
B00IYQU3EA|1|Does not fit in stock location on my '99 Summit X. I ended up getting and OEM part.
B0077RM6D8|4|I have had 130 pounds on them and they hold up fine.Easy to install also.
B000BYGD7E|4|Mejor q comprarlo en una tienda de repuestos. Mejor precio y la mejor calidad; no es posible conseguirlo tan r&agrave;pido en otro lugar.
B0002NYDYO|5|I was skeptical about this one in that I have hand packed for years.  I had to do 18 bearing in one day.  Maintenance on 3 trailers and figured give it a try.  It works great and saved a lot of time.  Clean off the excess old grease and then pump in the new.  The grease fitting to fill it up is cute but to I just used a putty knife and loaded it up.  It was quicker and a lot less pumping of a grease gun.  This one had thick plastic parts and the directions are very good.  The directions say you can put it in a vice and squeeze if for the stubborn old grease and there is no drought this unit will stand up to that.  Fortunately I did not need to do that.  The cover is nice to keep the unit clean ready for the next use.   .  Thanks John M.
B0038AXDEY|2|I bought these and I thought they looked great on my truck.  I have had these on my truck for almost one year.  They developed moisture on the first day of use and it has only gotten worse.  I live in the dry central valley of California and I should not have moisture in my headlights.  I am returning these on the one year warranty.  They also do not emit as much light as the factory installed headlights.
B00NWCFYDG|5|Worked perfectly!
B00JH6K4HW|5|Great Product and their customer service is incredible.
B005KJOMIW|5|This was an exact replacement for the rectifier on the 20 hp Kohler engine installed in ny AYP/Huskee garden tractor, at half the price the dealer wanted.
B0041TVWV2|5|Great brand new alternator, not a rebuilt or refurb! Exactly what we needed and the cheapest price we could find anywhere
B00ERYNWVE|5|This sticker was bought with offending others in mind. And it works! It went on fairly well and seems to be staying put. I got mine in white after asking for that color. The guys at 247Skins delivered. I would definitely order from them again.
B0016J5DOC|5|Very quiet, excellent stopping power, and they are lasting nicely.  These have been on my Trailblazer for a couple years now and still have a ton of life left, and I tow with the truck, and have a ....let's call it &#34;spirited&#34; driving style.
B001CF4UXU|5|Nice
B00CA350BE|5|Easy to install, perfect size for complicated applications with limited room. Well worth the money. Necessity if you want  to be able to watch your DVD player with your vehicle moving.
B0028IHDIY|5|The Convert-A-Ball cushioned hitch is the perfect solution for towing without the bumps and groans and clunks that are common with most hitches during starting and stopping.  I bought this together with the Convert-A-Ball PH1 hitch system and it has been a match made in heaven.  No noise whatsoever when starting and stopping.<br /><br />The only drawback I can see with this system is that the hitch mounts to this mount via 4-bolts, plate-to-plate.  This is fine for normal use, and is plenty robust, but if you have trailers with different tongue heights and need to adjust the height of the ball, its a bit of extra work vs. other adjustable height designs.<br /><br />Other than that, the mount and hitch system together are solid, reliable, and of good quality.  The cushioned mount design is great for eliminating noise, and I'm really happy with the system overall.  Highly recommended.
B00030CYD8|5|Husband bought this for a project. He had no complaints
B00LLLAKTS|3|it's cheap but awesome!! only problem would be the hardware will vibrate off so make sure all the nuts and bolts are screwed tight. reason I gave it three stars is because I upgraded all the hardware and modified some pieces to make it better, other than that very fun.
B00JKED0ZY|1|Yep, pure junk. I took a chance knowing better since I can usually make anything work. Chinese riff off, hate I wasted my money and time trying to make this POS work.
B000SBCHCA|5|Very good.It works.
B003V00CH2|4|Great product, easy to put together and has really helped block the wind. Only complaint is that is rattles a lot.
B002MQCY7C|4|I have no complaints about this product. It works as advertised and it was very easy to install. Highly recommend it.
B00F0M2WS6|4|Fitter perfectly on my Honda CRV 2009. Easy instalation, no problems so far.
B000WLHGJA|5|Living in New York City is like driving in a bumper car ride.  When it comes to parallel parking everyone is on their own.  This bumper bully gives  protection for the rear of the car that would be vulnerable without such a product.
B00JOP3G08|5|Had this on for about 100 miles in a dusty environment.  So far so good.
B00GI77W6O|5|These look really cool.  No codes.  I'll put them in my other cars too, if they pass the thirty day test.
B006WQS0V2|5|I always buy my wheel bearings from Detroit Axle. They are significantly cheaper than all other brands and when cross referencing a lot of other brands are using these wheel bearings and attaching their own part numbers and packaging to them.
B001RMT5Q0|3|Fits perfect but had some trouble with getting the turn signal ligt to work my husband had to keep messing with it.
B00C6SI0QU|5|After fighting the plunger-style epoxies for years, I am now in love. Single use packets eliminate the mess. Bonds really well.
B00062ZOUS|5|Though not advertised, These also work well for A/C Hoses.<br /><br />I used this #3262 (Red) for the 13/32&#34; Discharge Hose, & the #3366 (Blue) for the 1/2&#34; Suction Hose.  However, the Stainless braid will have to be tucked under the Crimp Shell, no room between the MagnaClamp & the A/C Hose Crimp Shell.<br /><br />Then used the #7490 (Red /Blue) Kit for the Engine Coolant Hoses.<br /><br />Note, all this can be rather time consuming. I also found the MagnaBraid  Very Difficult to cut. I ordered FLEXOSCI Heavy Duty Serrated Edge Scissors/Shears ($12) to complete the cutting, as nothing I had in my shop cut the braiding well. On the plus side, the MagnaBraid is TUFF!<br /><br />The end results can look very nice, just be advised this is not a 10 minute job!
B0007TF766|5|Use this for my genuine leather seats and trim (not sure how it works on the faux stuff),  it really brings the color (black) out, and reduces appearance of creases and cracks.  Lasts probably 3 weeks in the summer with the seats taking abuse from the sun.  Huge difference between leather with vs without.
B000BQ07YM|3|A few alterations, looks different did the job well
B00D12S4UC|5|worked very well.
B0031XSH7Q|5|This is our second Winegard MP-1 dish  (my brother-in-law just had to have our 1st one!)<br /><br />To say this works well, is an understatement - it is incredibly easy to setup and align, decent fade margin under most conditions, and never gives us the slightest trouble - then, it is incredibly small and the package is perfectly designed for storage (everything, including cables, (even 50' extra) sat alignment meters, sighting compass, (yes I know it comes with one, but I prefer my Suunto sighting compass) and some assorted connectors)<br /><br />When the automatic dish on our RV is blocked, this is a perfect work around (or it could be your ONLY dish for that matter)<br /><br />There really are no negatives for this small manual dish - If I have to come up with one, it can be a bit \\"twitchy\\" for the first time user to set the elevation, but that's a \\"reach\\" to find something - azimuth is simply not an issue especially if you use the supplied base (but we seldom use the base) - no skew adjustment to deal with - we also don't use the water \\"weight\\" container, haven't needed it - If you do use the \\"weight down\\" container, maybe use \\"VERY DRY\\" sand in the winter<br /><br />Price is VERY good in my opinion and the product simply works!<br /><br />I can hardly believe how well it works!
B00AZJYDQI|5|Bought this to replace a worn-out malfunctioning chuck. Appears to be well-made and should last.
B000LVXOBA|2|Lost it after 2 minutes of swimming in the ocean.
B0002JMIEK|5|Nice wax to use goes on so smooth and wipes off very easy to a sparkling shine !!! very happy with purchase !!!
B002TJ3R9Q|5|Very strong
B0056DS7SS|5|I got it has a gift for my husband and he loved it thanks a lot I will recommend u to more ppl
B008MCZ76U|1|i wanted to get something with coast guard senior chief on it but this was pretty much all i could find  not something i really wanted to get but there were almost no other options  this is something i wish Amazon could work on  seems like there is a lot for the other services but almost nothing for Coasties  please find more for USCG
B000CQ6G64|4|Bails too long
B003DNL8YI|4|The car cover is thin. Maybe half as thick as some other car covers I have. It fit the car with no problem.<br /><br />I was disappointed there are no hold down straps for either end. There are only grommet holes in the center for a cable tie which has to be purchased separately.<br /><br />If you have used the cable tie type before, you know the grommets can pull out of the car cover. This design is also poor because if you live in a windy area like I do, the ends of the cover always blow loose from the car.<br /><br />These guys or someone else need to design a car cover with straps at either end and grommets in the center for a locking cable too.<br /><br />For most people it would probably be fine. I would not buy it again because I need a car cover that can be fastened to the car more securely.
B004A6I3Q8|5|Shipping kinda slow but product was on point! Drop in firment!
B00SNLIPFA|5|Fit my paceman perfect.
B00076QA4C|5|Great for SUV's. I like keeping things organized. This net allows for that. Great quality, holds a lot.
B001LHVOVK|3|I could not read the code. I tried it with the car off, and key in ON, and tried also with car running. It could not read or connect to computer.  I will keep this handy for other people who might want to borrow tool.  I purchased Actron CP9125 PocketScan Code Reader and that worked on my car.  Gave it 3 stars because its did state Works with most OBD-II compliant U.S., European and Asian vehicles, apparently not a 2006 S40.<br />Otherwise the cord is slightly longer than the Actron.
B000AMBNPY|3|This doesn't look like a genuine Auto expressions shade, as i have bought Auto expression shades before from stores with AE tags, Well for the review, i bought 2 sets (4 pieces) it works well but its not for every car, for my 04 corolla its short on the sides and too high for the height. but it works ok.
B001KQJRDO|5|Great quality, great price, paid $75 for a part the dealer wanted to charge me $275 for and it is the exact same product.
B000FFGLJO|5|I was pleasantly surprised to receive these parts and see that for once the rotors were made somewhere other than China these days.  They came nicely packaged with a good protective film coating on both sides of the rotors complete with a Raybestos warranty.  I installed them on my 2007 750LI to replace my BMW original rotors after they wore out after 60K miles and were too thin to turn.  I got these for a steal at $35.16/each including tax and shipping considering they are over $125 -$150 at a local parts store and $250+ each at a BMW dealership
B0032RODJM|5|One of the orders I'm happiest with. Easy enough to install, very easy to roll up solo. Everyone likes it and I have received many compliments about the improvements to the truck since I bought it. I know it's mainly the clean look of this cover that has transformed the look of the truck and has my friends drooling.
B001D57JZK|5|I bought my jackets on April 10, 2014.  It was delivered on April 17, 2014.  On April 25, 2014 I was riding my bike down Interest 81 South and hit a deer at approximately 70 MPH.  I had about 5 feet of reaction time to decelerate.  When I hit the deer, I was thrown over the handle bars and landed on my right shoulder. I was transported 50 miles via life flight helicopter, to the nearest trauma center.  I was diagnosed with a broken right clavicle (the bone between the neck and arm/shoulder joint), a rib, and had minor bleed in my brain.  No surgery was necessary.<br /> The state trooper reported that I slid approximately 50 feet from the point of impact.  The jacket was chewed up, but did not give.  I did not get any road rash on my shoulders, arms, chest, or back.  I did get a rub burn on my right elbow.  The rub burn was a not the result of my elbow rubbing against the pavement.  It was from my elbow rubbing against the jacket sleeve.<br /> The paramedics cut my jacket off me prior to loading me into the helicopter.  As soon as the insurance check clears, I will buy another one.<br /><br />Tom
B005HMJIIQ|4|they wortk well but do not fit the original prongs for the interior lights. if only they had dual functioning daytime running lights.
B000CIICWS|5|The B&M Shift Improver kit is a great product (actually 2 in 1 since it has 2 possible setups), it comes with all the parts necessary to modify the shift speed and firmness (it won't modify the shift points), and to augment the pump pressure output in your trans. This particular kit is aimed at the E4OD transmission found in many Ford trucks from 1989 to 1997, in my case this kit was installed in the E4OD found on my 1993 Bronco. If this is your first time messing with a transmission then this is your kit, detailed step by step intructions will help you all the way, and it isn't as involved as some other kits in the market. Regarding the quality, it's top notch (even though the supplied drill bit broke), the springs are beefy and strong compared to the stock ones you'll find in there, and there is a new cork pan gasket which is very nice (not my favorite kind, but it worked great and it hasn't the slightest hint of a leak).<br /><br />The installation will require some time and attention, but it can be done easily and with mostly regular tools, if the trans is out of the truck I recommend doing the pump spring modification, if not, then you'll have to do the resistor mod (this is a &#34;either one or the other&#34; deal, don't do both). Personally I have refrained from doing the resistor mod, but might do it in the future. Since you have to take the trans pan down I would advice adding a drain plug kit if you don't own one already, these are a couple of examples: [[ASIN:B00029WR78 B&M 80250 Automatic Transmission Universal Drain Plug Kit]] [[ASIN:B000CO96EK Dorman HELP! 65128 Transmission Drain Plug Kit]]. If like me your objective is to improve the life expectancy of your trans, the addition of a cooler will also help you achieve this (heat is the #1 cause of transmission failures), I also went with B&M and installed this one [[ASIN:B000CIGE9G B&M 70268 SuperCooler Automatic Transmission Cooler]]. If you want further help with the installation of both the cooler and the shift kit, enter this search in your fav search engine and you will find a pictorial elaborated by me: &#34;Ford (89 - 97 E4OD) B&M Trans Cooler and Shift Improver Kit install (No resistor)&#34;.<br /><br />The results? well, now my transmission has firm, crisp and quite fast shifts for all gears, which reduce the clutch discs wear by reducing unnecessary slippage, which in turn also reduces heat. I went with the Stage 1 which is a little softer, this left me with a firmness you can clearly perceive, but without being uncomfortable, all in all you will like this product very much.t kit, enter this search in your fav search engine and you will find a pictorial elaborated by me: &#34;Ford (89 - 97 E4OD) B&M Trans Cooler and Shift Improver Kit install (No resistor)&#34;.

B004K35DSW|5|Great. Thank you!!
B002EBSLP4|5|Great quality.  Arrived intact, and early!  I am very pleased with the purchase would recommend.
B000E35UWQ|5|Exact fit and quality for my son's 2000 CR-V.  No complaints.
B003ENG3M4|5|Perfect and easy to install
B00J62T4UU|5|Once we figured out how to properly install them, was a piece of cake. Instructions were a little vague, but requires much less unscrewing and all to fit. You don't need to take off the light or other parts as it seemed from the instructions, just unscrew a couple screws, pop this on and re-install the screws. Love these, makes a big difference in the look of my Tacoma!!
B009GBD02O|5|Excellent and high quality advise that you buy them or Taataml
B00BYG7SEU|5|best bushing, thank you
B001U9Q662|4|This product arrived in a timely manner in the way it was described on Amazon. The negotiations were smooth and the product fulfills all of my game saving needs. Thanks!
B00GYZQV3A|5|Just as described and well made
B00EI6CKVE|5|Easy to apply. Love it
B00JZSQWK0|5|purchased a ford mustang 50 years edition and the key chain look awesome .
B000C9KN7E|5|A very solid pump, with a cast impeller instead of the stamped metal like the OEM model this replaced.
B0090DXBEK|5|Worked perfect the first time. I found a quick diy on YouTube to program.
B005M16QY6|5|On my knees all day in attics and crawl spaces, fit under my pants, now my knees are getting better!
B00JUQFVX6|5|good price. good quality. protects back of the car seat and I can fit many things in its pockets.
B000F285EG|5|Keep your hi-lift jack handle secure with this and protect your standard handle clip from breaking. This will not cause ou jack to rust.
B00KRMVE8S|5|Exactly as described, and completely identical to the clips that were in my 2000 Outback, other than not being old and worn out. :)<br /><br />I'll be ordering a second set, as there were 14 clips to replace in the front doors alone, and I still need to do the back doors. I don't yet know how many there are in the back doors, but if you're doing all 4 doors, you'll probably need two bags of these. I knew that was likely going in, it's just that I didn't know how well these would work beforehand, so I opted to wait and see. Now, I know they work.
B00029XGIM|3|I would not say loud,<br />I guess for the price what you pay its working just fine. Good thing it comes with extra connectors so it is easy to hook up to the original wiring.
B0002F9YIC|4|I like it.
B004I0YOWS|4|The quality of the plastic used on these are actually better than that on my OEM Subaru lights, with better tolerances and a smoother finish on the back of the housing. Some reviewers have commented that the molded plastic strap for the retaining screw is thinner than on the OEM light and this is indeed true, but the the plastic strap on the OEM also jams on the top of the opening in my Subaru. You have to force it in. Not the case with these aftermarket lights which you can smoothly slide in. The plastic on some areas of this aftermarket light are a tiny bit thicker than the OEM light too. The one area were these lights far short is that the rubber gasket on mine fell off in the box when I received it. The gasket had shrunk and detached itself. I just pulled off the gasket from my old cracked OEM light and attached it using regular double sided tape, a bit of extra work. If it was not for this, this light would deserve 5 stars.
B00I54XPBO|5|I installed these about 6 months to a year ago. They were very easy to install and I have never installed them before. They are working well and so far I'm very satisfied.
B0033WDG58|4|1st control failed after 14 months. I bought another one because I was wired for this one plus it was inexpensive. Works great simple to setup.
B005DLLVMW|5|Well built quality design that functions as it should. Had on trailer for several months and no rust at all yet. Alloys appear to be rust resistant or rust proof.
B002TWUTK8|4|Works Great nice and sensitive should anyone sit on your bike. Sucky part is you only have about 4 seconds to get key in hole and unlocked or it will start screaming which kinda sucks on a quiet block. So don't drop key once key touches hole. Just sayin. Subtract one star for that
B005BNZFQ0|5|Perfect for anyone who needs to convert from one plug type to another.  Very well built and nice and sturdy for all those how have an RV and constantly having to change plug type while ion the road.  I liked these so much I purchased other changer.
B000F5LJQO|5|These fit the bill for replacement hoses at a reasonable price. No anti-blowback feature, but great used with quik couplers.
B00445L290|4|This little vac is very powerful and very handy in the garage to vacuum both my wife's and my car.  My wife has been using it in the house to vacuum in tight places, especially high places that the house vac can't reach.  I highly recommend the vac for light duty which may also be used in the house and some shop duty.
B008SNWQP8|1|Junk.  Very difficult to actually pump anything, especially any large toy (e.g. kiddie pool). Save your money and upgrade to a better quality pump.
B000EBMLIY|5|These adjustable straps are Great! I was so happy to get them and they were so cheap! What I like is that they are adjustable, so if you need one door to be able to open further it can. I've had the straps for a short time but they are made of the same material my originals are so they should last for a long time. Great product and I received them in a very short time. The waiting time was more than reasonable.
B001P6GONU|5|My husband loves his new brief case.
B008J151H4|5|Great
B007NJFAA6|5|Fits good and took about 5 minutes to install. Looks fancy under the hood. Sakari shipped it fast. Only a cosmetic upgrade in my opinion.
B003AVSB7K|4|I am giving 4 stars simply for the fact that I would have liked to receive new insert washers (piece that goes in from the top and has the &#34;cup&#34;shape at the top).  The existing body mount hardware on my 95 YJ was either corroded and gone or I destroyed it trying to get the old out.  I had to try and salvage the upper insert washers for re-use.  The kit itself was just as advertised.  Arrived in a prompt manner and fitup perfectly on my YJ.  Like I said, the hardest part was getting the old mounts out.  If you are new to this, please read some forums, etc. before you attempt.  My install required multiple access cuts in the floorboard to access broken off mounting hardware.  I have since welded everything back together.  Just be forwarned!  Also while you have the old mounts out it is a perfect time for some preservation of the frame mounting locations as they can sometimes become severely corroded as well.  This a good kit.  Good Luck!
B00KJ8JRXO|5|Great quality light, had a bad bulb they replaced no hassles after one email received replacement in less than a week. Great service very impressed. Converted my headlights to 12k and fog lights to 3k
B004HHGHAY|5|Loved it!
B000VYPZ1E|5|it worked just like the
B00NSEMHRO|2|Disappear in one day after installed although they fit in.
B00L8MWGYM|5|Great
B001G7WQ7G|4|Ensure you use a tutorial when replacing or get a professional to do it - this part DOES NOT COME WITH NECESSARY O-RINGS that are on your current fuel filter, so they must be taken from the old and put on the new.    Besides that, it took me about an hour to complete the whole project. Made a world of difference. Using OEM parts was very comforting as well.
B004GCOS56|5|I have a Jetta with 260K miles on it.  I try to keep it looking nice and my front spoiler was cracked.  Given the age of the car, I try not to spend too much keeping it up.  I figured for $30 I couldn't lose.  Frankly, I'd put this on a car with 10K on it, it's just as solid and looks exactly the same as the one that came on it.
B005HFYE1O|5|Great relays.  Easy to use.
B00684TIVE|5|It's a keyfob!  I bought this for my '03 Xterra and I've had no problems.  Unlock, Lock, and Alarm buttons all work.  Do what the directions tell you and you're golden.
B006XKBP28|3|works OK, but surface does not have a nice smooth chrome-like finish.  Would not recommend fior a new or very nice vehicle.
B003M73GAE|5|Great functionality at a good price.
B0007LVJ2A|5|Very well made
B005EPF82Q|5|I dig it. It's well made. Don't know about the brand. I just dig Norse methodology.
B007O5GYVI|5|The Prodigy P2 brake control was very easy to install. It is small, light weight, and is adjustable to the characteristics of your specific trailer and tow vehicle. The LED display provides a visual check of the brake system connection and for the control voltage being applied. The breaking action of the trailer is controlled nicely by this unit.
B0009IK5XK|5|These are nice wiper blades that are easy to install, don't streak, and last for quite some time. Recommended, especially considering the price.
B000CIUAS2|5|excellant overall experience, everything came exactly as i was told, will purchase again with no hesitation in the future period
B00CAY8WOU|4|Quick delivery, good product.......... TIP TOP
B000HBGJG6|5|I got this to use on the elliptical I have in my living room. I get up early and don't want to wake up my roommates. This made the elliptical completely silent. Now I need to quiet down my huffing and puffing.
B0079KRFAW|1|[[ASIN:B0079KRFAW XADO Revitalizant EX120 for automatic transmissions (blister package, syringe 8 ml)]]<br />Did not notice any change in the way my toyota truck shifts...<br />Ripped off again!
B00I4D6SJ2|1|Think twice about installing of using a non-UL certified device!
B00DJ5KE9A|5|Does what you want it to. seems to be accurate.
B004A1364C|4|Purchased a pair of steps for Ford E-350 church vans. Step quality was good but mounting hardware was lesser quality than expected. Box came shipped torn up. Ends of one of the steps was bent. Had to hammer it out. Had to a angle iron to make the steps fit the van.
B007WYYZFS|5|great product for the rpice
B000C9SJUC|5|I ordered this because the cord on my gas cap on my 2000 seville cadillac was borken missing for the last 2 years finaly got around to a new gas cap   works good now issues fit fine   great product good price
B000I14F2K|5|Great
B0067BPC68|5|Works as advertised and solved a problem in the process.
B007PLZGO2|5|Pretty easy to install... I was confused about the instructions.  The seller sent instructions that say &#34;rub on the masking tape&#34;, which i thought was the backing... turns out it's the clear adhesive.<br />Love the sticker, it's hilarious
B004IAGNNG|5|The obd scan tool works very good gives codes through your computer also shows onboard engine sensors temp sensors at operating conditions while you drive.One thing is do this test with some one don't do alone for safety reasons .
B008H5UAY6|5|Worked great on my 4000 mile trip and looks good on bike.
B003ZUOQ7U|5|Hay do these tail lights fit  my 2005 escalade  esv
B007OSL3DY|4|The basic lock install is very easy, but could have a better velcro tab to hold it to the tailgate so it doesn't rattle around. Shipping was fast so I didn't have to wait long for it.
B00279BFCY|5|The part was in perfect condition.. I saved between $80 to $120 on the price of the part from other car part locations. After installing it my self I saved around $200.  I will be buying all parts from amazon from here on out!
B0010DXYHW|5|Brand new item.<br />Perfect fit in my 2009 Camery XLE.<br />No issues.
B005F6QZOO|5|Works great.  A+
B000CQ4CVU|5|Great wire set, I had to return them for another set, the item description is very vague, Generic photos don't help either. They were quality wires though. The wire set I recieved here were a made up set for a big block chevy, NO assembly required at all, a plug and play set for sure.
B001JT12A8|2|does not fit wide spokes on utv steering wheel, its in my junk box for things i might need later-someday-whenever, so sad.
B003RX0ZQG|5|Great deal the dealer wanted $74.00 and it was easy to program.
B00K25EN24|5|Awesome Christmas gift and light works great!!! Thanks very much.
B00PWUDKGE|5|Good Product
B0049EQX0O|5|original
B001THVNCM|5|Just as the bottle says, VERY slick. lots of shine! Now, lets see if it holds up over time.
B00008BKX5|5|i doubted this device, bit after using it two weeks I'm convinced... For hauling wood from the lumber yard to hauling a canoe..this works!
B000CO7IK4|5|great heavy duty switch better than what the stores are selling came earlier than expected very happy worked well in my riding mower!
B003MRJR3O|4|Its a great key chain. Looks great but only negative I would give it is I've had it a couple months and it is already getting scratches on it and really I put it in my pocked with only my other keys so not sure how it will look in a couple more months but for the price it's great.
B004NBMDMA|5|This faucet was bought to replace the original one in our travel trailer which had developed a crack. The spray head is larger and nicer than our original, and the button that stops the water flow is much easier to use. The oil rubbed bronze finish perfectly matches our other fixtures.<br /> I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a replacement or just to update their coach.
B00061SGZO|1|I have used this set after buying it about 3 months ago. After using it about 40-50 times the clamp has begun to spread apart causing ball joints to press in crooked. I like all of the adaptors but would recommend buying a higher quality clamp.
B000CQI202|5|My step-dad needed this and it worked extremely well, it was super easy to install and did it's job well for his RV!
B001TI5IIQ|1|Doesn't work at all, tried on my car and my friends. Tiny sand paper would take 5 hours to buff out normal headlight.
B006ACYXTQ|5|Got them fast and installation was simple ... took 8 mins at most... now I can see behind me clearly .. almost into the past (WOW!!) would recommend to anyone I know who drives a dodge ram
B002MYW0DW|5|Good item.  Works great
B000BGOCPM|4|Bought this to replace an old one whose strap had broken/disappeared from age and use.  This popped right on and works just like new!  Oh... it IS new!
B000N35LKI|5|Perfect for reaching bolts that are near impossible. Tried changing the transmission filter on my 2003 Acura tl type s but got stuck with 4 bolts that were in tight little areas, deep under the throttle body/air intake.Tried everything possible and almost resorted to paying hundreds of dollars to change the filter.<br /><br />Bought this and it reached all 4 with ease. Very long so you can generate a lot of torque to get out old rusted bolts. This is a must have product if you plan on working on cars and don't own a professional set worth hundreds or thousands
B004ME11FS|3|Works but leaks on both ends. Must take extra steps to provide your own better gaskets and always keep some plumbers tape handy. Still it will leak in places near the ends that you can't prevent.
B0065V2MRW|4|very good service and attention, I recommend. and JESUS ​​said, time was fulfilled, and the kingdom has hacercado DOS, repent and believe the gospel
B0036QV7PW|5|I was surpised at the quality of this item.  It is a heavy, well made emblem with and easy to apply peal and stick pad on the back.  I could not be more pleased.
B005NLQAHS|4|i like
B001E3B84E|5|I love these boots. They feel sturdy and well constructed. These are a nice chunky motoboot - not dainty and girly like many seen. The heel offers the perfect bump in height for me as I have short legs and all of my jeans are too long. The zipper is also well constructed and not cheap feeling by any means.<br /><br />It did take a few times wearing them to break them in, so I suggest wearing them for short amounts of time initially as I got a blister on my Achilles tendon area from wearing them for over 8 hours and standing the whole time. I am going to purchase some insoles to add a little extra cushion and then I think these will be perfect!
B00480FIEG|3|Recieved Product in a timely manner. Product was packaged ok.  I thought the lights would be blue when lit but turns out they still light up yellow.  Its my fault i guess.
B001O86VXW|5|Very nice!
B00QU6247U|5|He is so happy!
B001Q3E5W4|5|Solid mount but does not fit all models.  Bought the Superwinch 2060 Portable Ball Hitch Mount together with the LT3000 winch only to find both products were not compatible.  Quote from Superwinch's web site:  \\"Recommended for use with remote switched units only within the LT2000, S Series, Original X Series, and GP Series. Warning: Do not exceed bumper or ball hitch capacity!\\".
B000H2W270|4|I LIKE IT.
B005DM0OC4|5|Very easy to install
B001AVSIOI|5|Exactly what I wanted and needed.
B0085XV9JA|5|Happy with purchase.  Trash can is Small but handy to keep car clutter free.
B009W8BJRO|4|It takes a little bit of fiddling around to get the fit right, but it’s an easy job.  If you have it adjusted incorrectly it either won’t lock or won’t open, you just have to play with it until you get it right.
B0002NUO6K|5|This was the only thing that move those stupid advertisement dealers sticker on the back of my car. Thank you
B000NZMP28|5|For the price these are great.
B00MHYSS8I|3|Not aluminum.  No instructions.  But 1.2k cheaper than LR OEM.  You need LOTS of patience and time to get these to fit well. Worst part is the mud flap fit.  I spent about 10-12 hours and still need to work on the gap between the mud flap and body panel. Will use push rivets and drill receiving holes into the body panel. The only good way to make them snug with little/no gap.  Decent product with fit issues, but if you have mechanical ability, I think they can work. Be careful not to overtighten bolts!
B004VAQOCS|4|I've not tryed them yet, but seems a very high quality product for ATV rough use
B0001EWLQG|5|Made in America!<br />2 minutes to attach.<br />Form fitted for the vehicle 1998 Toy 4Runner<br />Recommend this product to all.
B001JT77K2|1|Cheap plastic look. Fan run noisy. Returning . Better quality at lesser or same price available elsewhere. Not worth the money.
B0046NPOGC|2|late arrival, wrong length, used handle on old dipstick, all is well
B00DTL4RLA|4|Perfect fit, reasonable price and similar to original performance. One thing that is cosmetic in nature is the quality of paint which is poor and I think some Quality Control should take care of. I sprayed mine with Hammerite paint the day before I installed.
B004I8M03K|5|Ordered this for my 2001 Dodge Ram 1500, and it fit perfectly. Looks just like it should. I am very satisfied with the product.
B00F6CJ2Q0|5|Perfect match and very easy.
B000CSRA3K|5|perfect fit
B005ASY23I|5|It's amazing how much pressure this little pump puts out. The cord with the clamps is plenty long and the filler hose adds a few more feet so you'll never want for more hose.
B000ALDROU|4|What can I say about the Strong Arm gas charged lift supports? It's a good replacement for the broken stock lift arms.
B0049EOXOW|1|i ask for the actuator for the left rear and I think they sent me the one for the front door.
B0002CSQ7A|5|Perfect addition to the lights. I wish they would bundle these guards together with the lights themselves. I don't remember if they came with a sticker or not.
B00QDWPL0I|5|Great quality. Only took two or three days to get here and they have already saved my hands a few time. The plastic is not that strong but the bar can take a hit.
B00J2CHSY8|1|I purchased these so my fog lights would match my 6000K Projector HIDs I recently installed. Do not get this if you want fog lights to actually work as fog lights. These are laughably dim to be used as a light on a vehicle. There is no projection forward at all. I got the 6000k version and it doesn't color match 6000k HIDs at all. I can't recommend this at all. I put one in to compare to the factory fog lights and immediately took it out. Don't waste your money.
B000M96RVA|5|I have yet to actually use the item, but I can tell you it is obvious it is going to work and work well.  Using it with just the operation by my fingers, shows the idea to be rather ingenious yet simple.  I have no doubt it will  work.  I will be changing my oil in a couple of weeks.  Update:  It worked well.  However, you must hold the item up on the filter while you work the ratchet in order to get it to \\"bite\\" onto the filter.  Keeping the ratchet pressure on, remove your hand and turn to unscrew the filter.  One moved, you can remove with your hand.  Using a ratchet extension bar lets you get well up into hard spots.  As long as there is room for your hand to hold the tool temporarily on the filter, it works very well.
B00L5O8UDE|5|This worked great
B00BYQDHPY|5|quick shipping, not too big, does not slip
B00JLUD66A|5|For the E93 328i this is as good as it gets for performance upgrades. Adapts to intake and exhaust mods. Mid an upper rpms pull stronger. Mpg is solid. Is not a turbo but puts some strength in the output.
B004PQHSWS|1|Very uneven, sloppy construction. for the price not too bad but i was expecting much better. they look all right but i will be replacing them asap
B003M68AJ2|5|Looks great on my Jeep. The only issue are the O-Rings that fall out too easily and are hard to keep in place while putting the caps on the valve stems.
B002BVAOA2|5|FITS just right, and it does add some pep on take off for sure. but i dont know if it helps mpg, i dont think it does. for some reason the avg. indicator on the dash takes a long time to change now.  im averageing 26.2 where as before i would get anywhere from 25 to 28.2
B004RZPX2E|5|ON Time, ON Budget, now ON my trailer!
B00BITKUUM|4|Worked great just didn't quite match the other switches
B001OVLAC6|5|This was a replacement for an older street avenger that was not working properly even after being rebuilt. It works great and has all the features I wanted.
B00BEN3K3Q|5|Only negative is the way your vehical handles now well forget about that after putting this on it .. It will be a rough ride on and off road ..<br />I love it tho. It gave my blazer a clean lift . And product were priced accordingly
B0087W7AZG|4|The Catlock 3.0 was simple to install. Recommend assembling the plates first to test fit over the cat(s). My truck had the cat mounted sideways, so had to slide plates over cat then tighten the eyebolts, as there was no way I could slide the eyebolts through both plates.<br /><br />So, just plan install and test fit everything BEFORE final install.
B0006MQJ0M|5|Perfect gift for my new driver!  Would recommend as a gift for any new driver or for anyone that doesn't have a kit already.
B002GXGDUU|5|I can feel the power increase and I'm hooked on the sound... and I'm getting better gas mileage. Somebody pinch me. :)
B0068EV7NQ|5|Sturdy, big enough but small enough.
B003WYVRL2|4|Guess I didn't lay these out right.  They seem to cover a wider area than my radiator.  I decide to step down and only use one.
B000PWZR4C|1|It did not work. Would appreciate if you could send me one that works
B0002SRH5G|5|I had been borrowing this from Buddy for years so I finally bought myself one. I looked on the tool truck and they wanted 200. 115 was a steal.
B00H6ETIWY|5|Put these on my Kubota RTV, and they look great!  The roll bar clamps were to small, but it was my fault for ordering the wrong size.  Was able to make it work with extra clamps I had, but the mirrors look clean, and are bigger than other mirrors on the market.
B006ZA9RU8|3|Looks great on my wife's Lancer but assembly was a pain in the butt. Be ready for some frustration when putting the mesh into the grille shells.
B008BRJ5FA|5|went to the dealership and it was 60 bucks a bulb, amazon had them for the best price and they have lasted longer then factory
B001KXN3YQ|5|I had a small oil leak on my chevy cavalier 2002 2.2 dohc. I tried a few other stop leak products. But I always end up back to Lucas products. I use all of their other products like oil stabilizer, power steering leak stop, etc etc. I found this one to work particularly quick. I was losing about a quart every 2-3 weeks. I debated getting it looked at until I learned that Lucas makes a stop oil leak. Worked great with no side effects. Saved me a fortune in a garage bill.
B005BHCF6Y|5|Great product
B00E1NACKU|5|Love it! Sets me apart from the hundreds of salt life decals. I like different :-)
B000C9JVRM|3|Installing this did not fix my problem.  It may be the part is fine and I have some other problem.  I ended up installing a dash switch to control the glow plugs.  That solution solved my problem.
B00E5PK8TE|5|Great experience. Came faster than expected!
B00BUL1KRK|5|Best ever
B00EFDJB8A|5|It was great
B001YIWEQA|4|Nice, just as advertised.
B003SEBYF0|5|UPDATE:<br /><br />My first Stebel finally partially gave up the ghost after a few years. It got weak sounding like only one tone was blowing or something. So I got a new one. Still the loudest, easiest to install and durable horn out there. Now I'm ready to scare the bejeesus out of people again. 😈<br /><br />Easy to install with the wiring kit I also purchased and this sucker is LOUD! Installed on my '97 Valkyrie, this horn is a great choice for bikers who wish to have the ability to scare cage drivers back into their own damn lane but don't want or have anywhere to install a two foot long traditional air horn on their bike. By the way, this horn is a lot louder than the Rivco Air Horn my buddy has on his bike... and even better it was about $150 bucks less expensive.
B000CIGEA0|5|this cooler is the best for my car
B00BQ0IMAS|5|Fit was right on, just had to notch front bumper to fit the Terra 45 winch on, slightly larger than the 35 or 25.
B00MV506VU|5|well pleased
B0052YJWYY|4|Great fit on the bike, took a little long to deliver but it added a great look on my 08 Lowrider.
B001PWA0IO|5|Good and ez to install
B000FJVO24|2|I haven't even removed this gauge from its package because I can see that the needle does not line up at all with the zero. Its not like its off a little, NO its way off. Don't know how something like this could get by quality control. I guess this is my fault for cheaping out on a boost gauge but I bought this one because it was the closest match to all the stock VDO brand gauges my car came with.
B0050ZAFGO|5|These lights are amazing, the only thing I didn't like was how the packaging was inside. The parts were moved around in the box, but everything seems to be working great so nothing was damaged. I'm trying to get my friend to get these lights.
B000BYGGVC|5|great plugs at a great price.
B004ENAFBS|4|I bought this guy as a nice emergency item and also for camping.  I connected the panel to my HTC G2 Android phone while it was playing the radio out of the included Goal0 speakers.  I had the panels positioned in a not-so-optimal way with only moderate sunlight and it charged my phone about 12% in an hour WHILE the radio was draining the battery and connected to the external speakers.  That battery is rated at 1500mah for anyone who cares about the specifics.  The other piece that I purchased alongside this kit was the Goal0 battery charging pod.  You can place 4 AA size NIMH batteries in the pod for charging with the solar panel.  When there is no sunlight around, you can use your available AA batteries to charge your USB devices.  I used the charging pod to recharge my smartphone again at night as well as my Kindle.  Honestly, if you have a lot of good quality low self discharge batteries around (Like Eneloops) you can pretty much get away with not buying the solar panel at all, the charging pod will pretty much do the job in the short term.    As far as the speaker goes, the sound is AWFUL out of the box.  As others have mentioned in their reviews of these speakers, the cones are covered by a heavy cardboard material.  I simply took a flathead screwdriver and used it to break the glue seal around the edge of speaker that adheres it to the case.  After that, I used the flathead to pry out the speaker from the case.  From there you can see the inside of the casing is lined with cardboard, and on that cardboard, there's a fine indentation where the speakers are.  I used a boxcutter to cut circles out where the speaker cones are.  Place the speakers back in the casing and you're good to go.  One note about this modification is that obviously the speakers are more than likely no longer \\"water resistant\\" as originally advertised.    All in all, very happy with the purchase.  I docked one star for the speakers being horrible as they were out of the box.
B004BTFPDS|5|Does not fit on a 1994 Ford F150 tire P235/75R15.<br />Not big enough to connect.<br />But that was my fault for not clearly reading the details and wasn't sure of my tire size at time of purchase.<br />Very good construction though.<br />Will keep and use on another vehicle.<br />Yellow Spider Bungee that is needed will fit inside of case.
B000KKLLFS|5|These must be good because they get stolen off my car every other week.
B0009OMYC4|5|bought this for ring job on a harley and it worked great! made the job easier. great buying experience and fast delivery along with a good price
B00877TP4K|4|seemed a little looser than the stock latch ...no satisfying pop when it closed but it didnt leak at the car wash
B000F3RYGA|3|this definitely nice heavy/sturdy unit<br />HOWEVER<br />they advertise in the headline that it &#34;fits all couplersl&#34;........BUT this is not quite true<br />while it does fit the 2 5/16&#34; ball socket ...it DOES NOT fit the coupler mount at all for a 2007 Wells Cargo 7x12<br />I did hook it up properly, but I can just give it a good shove & the bar falls over the front of the coupler & the entire unit quickly drops to the ground<br />I sure wish it would work, because I do like the quality
B0009H519Y|5|Great product!..also good for cleaning faded headlights!!
B002GQEZH0|5|Good quality, designed properly.
B003A6KZLK|5|Are very comfortable , easy to install and look very nice.<br />I love it, I recommend  this Skull Hand Handlebar.
B00BUS3AKS|5|Easy to install and works perfectly. However the cover was included on my previous Subarus. Cheaping out, Subaru. A $28K car should include something this basic.
B002N4PZ10|5|ORDERED FOR MY DODGE RAM GREAT PRICE THEY ARRIVED FAST I TOOK OFF MY OLD WIPERS THESE FIT PERFECT WORK GREAT
B002DY7ZMM|4|only one light worked when i first got it but i connected it to a different power source been workin ever sence
B000E81VN8|5|This organizer is real sturdy and seems to be very well made. The handles are a great feature to have on this.
B00029KBF8|5|We sought a spare tire bike rack to use with our '05 Honda CRV and this rack fits the bill par excellence!  This rack works great. It's solid, easy to install, and includes lock-down security which is a real plus. The rear gate also readily opens and closes when bikes are on the rack.<br /><br />Security is two-fold:  1) the bike rack itself can be locked down (using the padlock of your choice - we use a secure, hard-to-cut padlock) and 2) the bikes can be locked onto the rack with the supplied locking bolt. (Only 1 key is included for the locking bolt, which I thought was an error so called Surco who'll send a spare at $5 each; we opted to get a 2nd one made through a locksmith - which also cost $5.)<br /><br />This rack installed with no problem and is SOLID -- the bikes don't budge once tightened down into the rubber-padded wedges between two plates. While the two bolts do take a while to fully tighten or loosen to remove the top plate - it's also possible (if only 1 or 2 bikes are on the rack) to just loosen the bolts enough to slip the bike frame to or from the inner or outer wedges, and lift the bike through and off of the bike rack.<br /><br />I also like that the rack is easy to remove while keeping the rack plate bolted behind the tire AND the spare tire cover fits (without having to remove that plate bolted behind tire).<br /><br />Lastly, because CRV spare tire is off-center, when loading 2 or 3 large bikes, one or two may extend past the side of the car a bit, but that hasn't been a problem (other than maybe causing some drag, but not bad). Most important is that the bikes are SOLID and SECURE.  We highly recommend this bike rack.
B007WHWSTU|1|They shipped a ceramic ashtray in a box inside a padded envelope, with no other protection. Arrived in about 30 pieces.
B009V17BWY|5|Great! The only hard part was the downpipe. It is a snug fit but definitely worth it! Sounds awesone!
B004I0VK16|5|Replaced the clouded over original.  Easy installation.
B00F1319QK|4|Giving me some off readings with my ralliart sportback and stage 1 map. Correct octane used and even tried lower but still excessive knock readings. Still awesome for valet/anti-theft maps and will use it to store my Cobb pro tunes.
B000C3YTLG|5|K&N Oil filter<br />--bottom line--<br />K&N:  Great Quality and Performance<br /><br />I use with with Castol GTX full synthetic 10W-30 and change oil every 6,000 miles.  Highly Recommended with any synthetic oil(Royal Purple as well), and any high quality motor oil.<br />I also use a K&N Sport Cold Air Intake and cone filter, best quality and increased performance for my camaro.  Bonus feature is the external nut making it ultra easy to remove(don't need a special oil filter wrench to remove).
B0012BL8LG|1|I expected based on the ratings that this converter would run a portable 12 volt compressor for my wheelchair tires... it would not so we returned it. I am still looking for a 120 V to 12 Volt charger that will run said compressor.
B001G7O71E|3|Ordered by mistake.  Excellent, quality MB product.  Did a search for transmission dipstick, and this was about third item listed.  Looked great and had a nice price.  But, it wasn't what I was searching for.  I guess I just pulled the trigger on the order too quickly.  I did return the item and got a refund minus shipping.
B00ETIBV0C|4|Although these floor mats don't have pegs and holes to secure them in place, the sturdy construction leaves me confident that they won't move around excessively.<br />Plus, they match the excellent BMW front rubber mats.
B00A9X95LI|5|Good quality and price. Sounds good. Fast service.
B00NRV974E|1|My car Ford Crown Victoria. Lighting dispersed, non-specific Experience is not happy and I'm going to sell this product for not Alvaidm.
B0019UNGWO|5|It looks very nice and i'm amazed by the quality. I have a cadillac SRX and when i attach this keychain to my key it just make even more beautiful. I totally recommend it, the price is worth it.
B004V4HCH0|5|Great . They look good
B00CPBW6LS|5|love cats
B005HISE7G|5|Works and looks good! Installation was ok.i had to drill holes and mount with screws.
B000BQT5G8|5|It adheres incredibly well.  I was able to fix the door whistle on my old truck.  Definitely worth getting rather than paying an arm and a leg for other door seals.
B0002VAZA2|5|Great quality & value
B007PP07JW|5|Very easy to put on! This helps so that the door handle cups are not getting scratched up quite a bit! Make sure that you have time to wait for them to come to you!
B007WICV8C|5|great!
B000NPRTII|5|The only downside to this thing is that its a little bulky for my bike.  I had an air horn with separate pump and horns before and they would always take a second to work, this one is instant...and its loud, really loud.
B0053TU3OQ|5|Just like picture.
B007V1ZC86|5|They met my expectations, except the little misstep. I look forward to using them in the future.
B000C7UPTM|3|The lock and keys work great but the set I requested was meant to work in my 87 plymouth colt-vista and it does not. The delivery was fast and the product was in great condition.
B000HBNTX2|4|Really works to clean up grimy hands from auto work! Oil, grease, all kinds of dirt disappear from your skin.
B00GN3146W|5|Got here quickly and it costs a fraction of the OEM CalCat from the dealership. Love Walker CalCats.
B0069YZS6C|5|Fit my car perfectly.  Go BUCKS!
B005BRK26Y|5|Although it was indeed the cheapest pipe/header combo for the 150cc GY6 that I could find on the net, it performs PERFECTLY!  Looks great, sounds great and provides the low end torque you would expect.  5 stars all the way!
B00252BVC2|5|Well made filters at a good price
B0007LVHZ4|3|The item was fine but the dimensions listed were WRONG. The Item is actually smaller than listed. Thus, it did not fit. The length was too short. You should verify the dimensions with the manufacturer (Curt Manufacturing) before you purchase this item.
B001L9ZC6Q|5|Great price. Cute and stays put once on. Easy to apply
B007Q8ER6W|5|I love my floor liners. They fit perfectly, make cleaning easy, and keep the sand and dirt out of the carpet. I am very happy with my purchase!
B0002U2V1Y|1|I have been detailing cars and aircraft for forty years.<br />I have tried almost every thing out there as far as waxes and cleaners go.<br />I'm am a old school Simoniz guy. Yea, lots of work...but it works.<br />I would always use a cleaner first, Dupont worked.<br />I figured it might be time to try something new.<br />So I tried the Mothers clay bar. Did not work well.<br />I tried Meguires Clean and wax and that stuff is great.<br />Tried Klasse, real good stuff.<br />Micro fiber.. the more you spend, the better you get.<br />The clay was a joke.
B00062YKCG|5|Great product fast shipping
B0091DJXV4|5|good thanks
B007EEVMPW|5|The carb is perfect just a little tunnig amd it ran great
B000FPYCI6|5|Perfect fit and a great replacement. Have not had bending or flexing in the stabilzer since install and I have used my 4WD several times since install.
B000ELW7WO|5|Seems like very good quality. I got this as a replacement for a Chinese-made Beck/Arnley bearing. This one spins freely and smoothly, while the Chinese one was rough and didn't spin freely at all. I returned it. Changing this out took quite a bit of time so I'm glad I went with a quality part.
B007TO3Z02|3|I had bought this to plastidip my taillights to tint them. It definitely made them darker but it was a ugly tint. Took it off immediately. Might work better for something else but tails it wasnt useful
B00A3JH7HW|5|This is worth every penny. I love this on the seat base of my Grand Cherokee Limited... Yes, it will move around a bit if you slide your arse in and out, but just move up an inch, and sit yourself down/exit yourself out - it doesn't go anywhere. Super soft, looks and feels luxurious!
B009ANV81S|5|Great plug! Easy installation and always stays waterproof.
B00573N35O|3|I drive a Honda Civic 2012 and the reflector doesn't exactly cover the whole thing. There's some room that's left because the sheet gets shorter from being folded.<br />The worst part of the reflector is how ridiculously hot it gets. The first time I used it, I started folding the thing up and it startled me how hot it had gotten.<br />I am however happy with the design
B0009V1WR0|5|Delivered as described.
B000IG5IU8|1|So it's supposed to be blue but it came in black. I was disappointed the black is super plain and boring. The blue would have looked nice in my truck.
B000TYQB14|5|The dealership wanted far too much for this product, I am grateful for this solution, works great
B00NCGFNB0|5|much brighter for dome light than others.
B008CQUUYK|5|Great looking ' Biker Shade Sun Glasses ' !  Fast Shipping by the Seller & Excellent Communication. Quality Shades, fit my face like a glove. Plan to order another pair, a pleasure to do business with. Thank You from Linda in NJ ~
B005JCPPT0|2|Did not care for the hook lacy design and one of the bungee lines broke first trip out.  So far the rest of the cargo net has held so we can still use it.
B004B61B34|5|Bolted right up.  Fitment is perfect.  Worked as its supposed to.
B0027UPPF6|4|Worked great with my winch on my old Honda TRX300FW. No problems at all. Simple installation & simple operation. A great product and all is there in one package.
B000EFP68C|5|Reasonable and right
B00BYT1X9I|4|Ordered these to upgrade my interior lights in my Jeep.  Fit and worked well, reasonably bright, maybe too much for what I'm using them for.
B001CEG90I|2|Worked fine for about 2 months.  Now my car gets this musty smell almost everytime I turn the ac on.  My original never did that.
B000CO8R9A|5|Perfect fit first time. My second purchase of this same item and it fits GREAT ! HOWEVER, it is packaged very poorly and two out of two of them came missing hardware. The only advice I got from Amazon, was to RETURN the item, REORDER another item and HOPE the replacement came with the parts needed. That is more that INSANE, its stupid!!
B000RFDGGI|5|added to my 4.0L Cam Tool Kit so I could set both cams at the same time worked very well like I wanted price good recommend
B00CXJPKGK|3|They are not quite as bright as I would like. I am using them as part of the tail light assembly in a 2004 Honda CRV. Overall, not as bright as a stock OEM.
B00BFWIRMK|5|This aftermarket is as close as one can get to the original, great fit and with our aged car they had such in stock
B000FQ7IKE|5|Fit my TJ perfectly.
B00J26AVTI|5|thank you.
B0000AXQE8|5|Just got this little 12v. pot for heating water, soup, etc. and didn't expect much since I had a recent bad experience with a 12v. coffee maker that, after waiting over an hour for something to happen, didn't work at all.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised!  This litle unit is well-made and has some very nice features, such as being able to remove the pot from the base for easy cleaning.  I also like the fact that, as well as an \\"on\\" light, the pot lights up with a white light to let you know that it is seated correctly on the base.  It also has a nice safety feature in that it will shut off if there's not enough water, so it won't \\"burn dry.\\"  Best thing, though, is that it really does work!  It does take longer with 12v. units, but that's to be expected.  However, in less than half an hour the water was bubbling merrily away!  I am very pleased with my purchase and would definitely recommend it.
B000S2QVYE|5|Awesome factory quality. Work great. Hardest part was getting the old ones off
B00KTHT8VQ|3|I should have read more closely - it is ONLY the shell. There is no battery, or transmitter inside this thing. So really, the only thing this would be useful for is if your buttons or case broke on your original key fob, or maybe you want a more colorful case, and you are going to switch over the electronics from a previous key fob.  I'll keep it around in case I ever need it, but it isn't what I thought I was buying.
B001TJ70ZE|5|Unfortunately I had to return them because they are for the four door model and I have a 2dr model.
B00CCYWJQK|5|It worked just like the one in the video on Youtube. I was very pleased. I had to use 60 feet of 1 inch PVC pipe to extend it far enough to reach my sewer access. The SewerSolution had no problem at all pushing the waste through that added pipe.
B00MMUM3BA|5|cool
B0017K69MA|4|Is it necessary....no.  Is it useful...very.   I have a very sloped windshield that makes it difficult to get to the bottom of and clean.  This tool works great for that.  I use a number of Stoner products and you can't go wrong with them.
B000FCRS0I|4|We bought five ResQMe's. Each of our cars has one tywrapped to the left side of the steering column.  They're there so they can be found easily in an emergency.  We also have one on our keychains for the times we ride as passengers in friend's cars.  Our area of the Pacific Northwest is heavily infested with ponds, lakes, deep creeks, canals, rivers, and scenic oceanside roadways.  Each means a blown tire (and loss of control) could put us into the water.  Such a simple and inexpensive tool, near at hand, findable in the dark, can mean the difference between life or a miserable death.  I hope we never, never need to use them but I don't want to die thinking, \\"Really wish I had spent a little on one of those window breaker gizmos.\\"  (We rejected a hammer type device for the ResQMe's spring loaded breakers because swinging a hammer fast enough through the water in a mostly flooded car might be be impossible.)
B005HVG4GQ|5|Easy to use. Fast readings.
B00L7GTRR8|3|Installed and did what it said it did, stop the hyper flash. But the relay continues to move when lights are off. Does anyone know how to fix or what is causing this?
B000TYJQ3O|4|Good quality storage.
B004QDN518|5|Wanted to get rid of my single note horn on my compact car so set out to find a good replacement. Have read many reviews on this unit before ordering. A lot of the reviews were very good and some not so good saying they were not loud enough.<br /><br />Well let me tell you, this horn is LOUD! It gets other drivers attention very, very well.<br /><br />It was very easy to install as it is small enough to hide just about anywhere under your good. Simply put, a GREAT PRODUCT!
B000QS2XQK|5|Worked perfectly as I expected
B00KLL3A78|5|Excellent brake system at an excellent price. Recomend to anyone.
B0088RKKDY|3|It was what was advertised although just a little short in the body.  Feels good after the pads removed. Would order again.
B005M2259A|4|I didn't even remove the old foggy and cloudy mirror and just put it on top of old one and it went on just perfectly! The only reason I didn't give five stars is that the backside was chipped but luckily it was the back so it was OK :)
B00NOQJ6WU|5|Really like these. Nice comfortable soft compound that has held up well
B00JUQJ35S|1|The tape side does not stick. Waste of my money
B00M063RC0|4|I'm very impressed with the quality. It seriously does hold the phone well, and as ugly as it is on a motorcycle, it's still the best looking setup on the market right now. My very biggest complaint is the BIG red rubber logo!! Trust me when I say it will pop out like a zit on your motorcycle. I installed this holder, and then tore the logo off within 2 minutes, but then there was all the ugly glue behind it, and it does not come off. I guess the logical thing to do is remove it, paint it black, then glue it back.
B00B2AEG2A|5|Great quality!
B004JO3RO4|5|This order was a replacement. They arrived in record time and at a good value.
B002P8T3HQ|5|So happy I bought this and not the $450 part at Toyota Hawaii.<br />Glad to find a great you tube video on how to do it and with my limited woman's skill I did it all myself in about 3 hours :-)
B004WNU0Z6|5|Fit these and your spyder will look something extra special.
B00K5WBABG|5|Was fine
B000C2GIGQ|5|Good
B000LF61HA|5|Solved the problem
B005KP6NPQ|1|Purchased late May 2012, installed immediately.  Worked fine until a few weeks ago (early August) when car began to run rough and stall out at intersections.  Mechanic diagnosed trouble with analyzer and the only trouble code was again \\"Mass Air Flow Sensor\\".  This time ordered the more expensive, original equipment \\"BOSCH\\" Mass Air Flow Sensor.  Car runs like new again.
B00B9F1ZG8|5|Quick delivery and the part was ready to paint and installed easily.
B00EXS44MU|5|the device wonderfully fit my truck.  the shipping is quick.  i have no complaint.  i recommend this to those that have toyota tundra truck.
B008G1WEK4|5|I just finished installing this set on my 98 Chevy C1500.<br />The quality and materials exceeded my expectations for the price. They are made in Taiwan and box listed the brand as Eagle Eyes.<br /><br />They do no come with the bulb circuit board, but I was aware of this during my purchase and did not need this part.<br /><br />Installed easily without any modifications.<br /><br />The biggest surpise was the packaging materials and box each housing was shipped in. Each one was wrapped in bubble wrap and supported on each end with syrofoam; no cost cutting in the packaging department either.<br /><br />I would definitely look at other offerings from this supplier in the future
B000EQAVHM|5|OEM parts fit and finish excellent.  Would buy again.  I like the severe duty parts, no squeaks and good stopping power.
B00PUY6FOQ|2|If it's reception you want, keep looking.  This is not the antenna for you.<br /><br />If you don't use the radio and just want it for looks, go ahead but it's cheaper to just buy an antenna plug from the HD dealership.<br /><br />To be fair, I do get some FM stations clear still, many are full of static, and some do not come n at all.
B000BQSIWK|4|Works good, charges pretty slowly for 12AMPS. But it does work.
B001BLT24C|5|These work great on my 2009 Wolfy Jetta. I used these as a brights headlamp replacement and love the way it looks when they are on. Installation was a pain in the butt, but that was no fault of the bulbs. I am happy with the amount of yellow and intensity these bulbs produce. I will update my review if they burn out quickly.
B00FKZVW8O|5|great product meet my expectations and fast delivery
B0080IFSME|4|Good Product for the money.I have one complaint--It needs to come with a power steering evacuation cap.Round rubber cap that comes with it folds with more than 15 inches of vac.and slips off very easy.
B0057ZR8AI|3|I bough two twin packs and thought they arrived broken as they rattled when shaken.  I installed them and they worked fine.  It'll be interesting to see how long they last bumping around in the RV.
B001447TKU|5|USED IT ON MY LAWN MOWER AND IT WAS LIKE FOR LIKE MADE A BIG DIFFRENCE IN PERFORMANCE OF THE ENGINE.
B000OUZYAW|5|works very well, much sturdier than I thought would be. very happy
B000CM2VQM|5|the product was exactly as described and fit perfectly!!
B003VYCS7U|5|Nice wheel, heater definetely puts out more warm air.Had to replace the heater fan motor, so went ahead and replaced the Blower wheel at the same time.
B00S92BYEW|3|So overall I like them. i ordered the colorful kind, and I was hoping there was a dial to change colors but instead thry just randomly change to their own pattern. Installation was easy, and i could easily hide the wires. The sticky on the product is actually not very good at all, I'll have to go and put duct tape to hold them in.<br /><br />The light brightness is overall okay, could be brighter. But, if you place them just right they do light faily well!<br /><br />So other than the fact i cant pick the colors and the sticky part isnt very good, I give it 3 stars. i like it, its not expensive, and its my first time putting interior glow into my vehicle.<br /><br />(In image, my floor covers are zebra, and the pic was taken at 10:50 at night on a camera that couldnt take a pic fast enough at its brightest color flash. )
B00N1E7LOK|5|Great product at a great price.
B00BBFJTFU|5|Received my order 2 days after purchasing! Item was as described.
B005MZUQFM|4|I did not know what to expect.  This product will do what it was purchased for.  No complaints at this time.
B0036GNSGS|3|Alarm doesn't seem to function anymore for me but the lock is great. Easy to put on and keeps the bike secure.
B004GC44AK|4|My original tailgate handle cover broke when I pried it off to spry some WD-40 on the latch mechanism.<br />It fit my 2006 Silverado tailgate perfectly. Would get 5 stars, but made in Taiwan.
B005T3D7JY|5|Thank you for a great product!!!! Just what i wanted and i highly recommend it to all. Keep up the great work.
B00DLXXQIG|5|I ordered these for my husband's theater room and we paired it with the film poster. Looks great, we love it!
B006TMKAJY|5|fit as if it came from Nissan
B000C57KAQ|5|Easy and quick to install, provides a great ride and were less expensive than buying the parts separately.  It was a bonus that I did not have to mess with a spring compressor as well.
B000NK9CN8|5|I have installed K&N filters in all my cars and trucks over the years. They allow your engine to draw in maximum air when the demand calls for it. You really can go thousands of miles between cleanings. They pay for themselves in a year or so assuming you replace your paper filters as required. I could go on and on but you can not go wrong buying one of these.
B00A2F329O|5|Love it!
B0051TPJKG|5|We use them at our International Coleman Collectors Club Convention lantern light up. Eight of then are great security with a fire blanket and first aid burn kit.
B00CXXI4XC|3|Actual load capacity is 300 pounds not 500 pounds as advertised.
B008UX97JE|5|We use these towels at my fire dept for various use's. I and all the guys love them, they hold up super well..
B00700E8QA|5|excellent quality and message.. screw Obama
B003ZWG6MG|5|Great fit and price
B0002TPVXA|2|This container has numerous pockets and has the potential to be very useful.  However, the bag is unstructured and simply flops over or onto itself.  The walls of the bag are flimsy and actually make the bag feel cheap.  The picture shows the bag standing upright and firm, but that is definitely not the case.  I was expecting more and I think the picture is deceiving.
B000C53S1G|4|they fit
B000BY6HCA|3|Looks good, fits ok.  It gets dented up very easily though.  If anything sits on it, or even firmly brushes by it, it will leave a permanent dent, or crease in it.  It's not worth the money, and I wouldn't buy it again.
B009VLL1J8|5|Great Price and was a direct fit for my 2006 Ford F150 XLT.  They arrived on time and there was no hassle with the purchase.
B00KBAJSHK|4|Nice product. Unfortunately it is not a perfect fit for MB C250.
B004I0H86C|5|This is not a do it yourself project but if you are mechanically inclined you should have no problem installing the grilles.
B000K04CDQ|1|Advertised as direct fit for my model and year of Subaru. There a connector at the end, but it was NOT compatible for my vehicle.  I've learned one needs to be more careful.
B009031HUU|5|fit perfectly !
B000IXTGHW|1|It worked for 10 minutes before blowing the fuse for my power outlet. The device is rated at 13 amps, but it blew a 20 amp fuse. Go figure... DON'T BUY THIS!!
B00EW9G0H2|3|You get what you pay for. This gets the job done. Won't recommend if your going for a stiffer ride.
B000VDYQXS|3|They are a little thinner then expected, i don't think they will absorb that well. But overall i like them and they fit great! (:
B006LO8X6C|5|My battery died so i bought this one. Worked like a charm! I was able to ride the rest of the season.
B0006Z9SQQ|5|nice
B004ZF31X4|5|Bought over a year ago. Still running bright.
B00F7GXNX8|5|NIce idea and great product.
B0028JQYPG|5|They work well for the price.  They are sturdy and fit well under the vehicle.  You can spend 2 or 3 times for something that does the same job.  I'll probably use them 4 times a year if that.  For what you pay for these you can't beat it.
B00BV6UKV6|5|Replaced my stock plastic linkage that broke when the wipers were frozen after an ice storm. was quick and easy to replace.
B0068FYMVO|4|Was easy to install and it works. I wish it had an on / off button, but it gets the work done.
B001CEG96C|5|Decent price, arrived promptly, and fit in as a replacement filter without much trouble (just had to squish it a little to get it in, but once in place, it expanded back to normal shape).  I will probably reorder the same item in a few months.  Helps with musky air!
B000JZI1M0|1|I couldn't find a replacement at 2 local autoparts stores, so I tried this because it advertised as fitting my vehicle.  It didn't and I returned it.  Turns out, 2011 had a mid-year model change and there are 2 different blades available for the Explorer.  The early model uses a 13&#34; blade where the later model (the one I have) uses a 12&#34; blade.  And both have totally different arm mounting mechanisms.  I found all this out by going to a dealer.  So measure your blade before you buy.
B00BZAGHYC|4|Not as tall as original equipment battery, but so far doing the job.  Time will tell how long it lasts.
B000CGRMN0|5|This is the 2nd time I have ordered the red stuff from EBC. I love them.<br />Very low dust - in fact even after 3 weeks of not washing my car the rims are still kind of shiny. Compare that to the OEM brakes and you could have dirty rims after driving 1 day!<br />They do seem loud the first 500-1000 miles because they are still bedding in with the Rotors but after that they are as quiet as they should be.<br />I combined these with slotted rotors and I never experienced any brake fading or issues. Even when it's cold or wet outside these things never lose brake power (they actually brake harder when they are warmed up a little).<br /><br />Overall 5 stars - and the price with Amazon was 1/4 cheaper than some other places at the time of purchase.
B002ATT0FU|1|Motor has no blowing power and does not defrost windows very well. Don't waste your moneyon this product. Not even worth returning for a refund. I threw it away.
B008V3WKYC|3|Its a battery.  Keep it charged and it works.  I use it in my atv, which I don't use very often.  I keep it on a trickle charger and it hasn't failed me yet.
B00AHJZBCG|4|This light is very VERY bright.  You could blind someone with this thing maybe it is so bright.  Works great in my crawl space when the lights burn out, and works almost to well in-doors for finding things in the shadows.
B000S8DN5S|5|The results are fantastic. Thank you
B000EDUUIA|5|We have a fairly narrow garage, and parking far enough in to close the door but not so far as to make it difficult to get around the car can be tricky.  This was a great solution.  It was quick and easy to apply and has made parking much simpler.  Definitely recommend this.
B00080QGYG|3|Like everyone else said, it is to d*mn high.  Also did not fit right on the jack, but if you are using a transmission jack, you should have the skills to modify it.  I did not have any problem with the chain.
B0041MEBYO|5|ok
B00MH4I0K4|4|The arms are alittle tight and I did not know the size so I ended up ordering an extra large after and that was perfect! Alittle baggy but not too much! The medium was a size for like a little girl about the age of 6 because it fit my neice. Besides the size its a great jersey for riders and I reccomend it.
B001F0NNR6|5|It fit perfect thank you I will be ordering the right side in about one month truck looks a lot better with black
B008E7POE8|5|i bought 2 of these for my 2000 Ford explorer 4wd. perfect fit. car runs so much smoother now. great product. and say goodbye to abs light  for anyone replacing these on there own,u need a 1/2&#34; breaker bar and the correct shallow socket to remove all them rusty bolts
B004PJTZ2Q|1|ok, I was originally excited to have this item but the first one didn't work. I think the settings were reversed. It's weird and I was like that's odd because I tried to follow instructions but didn't work. Got my new one and its seemed to be fine so yeah I was excited then after the fourth time using it somehow it is acting up. It won't charge every time you connect it to your computer. I mean I pretty much have to beg it to work. It's weird never had that problem with my sony. I bought this as a back up but it looks like the sony is still the reliable one. Hope this helps because I'm getting tired of this product.
B009LP2TAO|5|I got the wrong color, but it fixes the problems we had with the original one.
B000ESDIIE|1|I purchased this alternator for a very good price as a spare since I was still on the original at 170k miles. I installed it with no problems and it worked great while I rebuilt the original.<br /><br />Fast forward a month later and it stops charging all of a sudden. Replacement of the regulator/brush assembly does not resolve the issue. One good thing is that it uses the same assembly as stock although the casting is different on the rear.<br /><br />I contacted the manufacturer and although they offer a lifetime warranty they refused to honor it because it was not purchased through &#34;a retailer based in New England.&#34; I'm in Mass. Nowhere on any of their documentation does it mention that caveat. The fact that it shipped from a New England based warehouse was irrelevant. So much for manufacturer support.<br /><br />Amazon came to the rescue. They offered a full refund though it was past the 30 day return window after I explained that I could not get anywhere with the manufacturer. Kudos to Amazon for supporting a company that shouldn't be allowed to do business on the internet.
B004E26BPS|5|GOOD
B003BZINVO|3|This model number is pretty much the same as other standard rear wipers.  If there is a notable difference, I can't see it.  But it is a perfectly serviceable wiper.
B000ALBSBE|5|Works like oem, nothing much to say, they cost much less than oem, not sure about durability, but for the price you can't go wrong.
B00563K5Y2|5|Works great everytime!
B00DILKM9M|5|As Advertised
B00ESASWRG|4|IT PERFECT PRODUCT I DEFINITELY  RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT  ,BUT IT'S JUST DIFFICULT TO FIT THE KEYS IN THE HOLDER, VERY GOOD
B00H1IC05W|5|Just what I needed
B00IO98BPA|5|Great valué , good quality , good price and good service
B003K1ES2C|4|Used this product to clean my 2nd hand toyota so there were stains from before my time (2 years +) I was disgusted to see how dirty the seats were. I used a toothbrush to rub in the foam. One can won't be enough for an SUV. I got it at 80% off but will buy a new one at full price to finish the job.
B003NZ7FZ2|5|This is an awesome set for my grandson fits great like how this was set as a set with affordable cost.  Thank you!!
B000OQMJ6S|5|OK.
B007GEMNXU|5|Very nice! I am quite happy with this decal.
B000C7YKR0|5|My car was missing and hard to start, I changed spark plugs which were sort of dirty, but still missing. So I tested my ignition coil with ohm meter and it tested OK, but I swapped ignition coil temporarily with friends car and missing and hard start went away so I ordered this part. You will need a 10 mm wrench for three of the bolts and I used vice grip for other smaller top terminal (didn't have correct mm socket or wrench). The part is easy to get to (driver side inside hood fender well) and will take about 15 - 25 minutes to change. The part I got was a Bosch brand. The car runs great now.
B0002SR7TC|4|Purchased to change the oil in a couple of newly acquired German vehicles with the topside oil filter access. I only wish all automotive manufacturers would get on board with this set-up. Nothing I dislike about vehicle maintenance more than removing a filter blind and invariably spilling used oil all over the innards of the car and down my arm.<br /><br />Anyway, the Mitvac has seen limited duty - two changes thus far, and has worked as designed both times. No issues creating or maintaining suction. The second go round, I did make sure to warm up the oil a bit more than the first time (it was a bit sluggish the first time). Cleanup is a snap. Purchased the brake bleeder kit as well, but have yet to have the chance to use it. No complaints.
B001ROSMTE|5|This Decal is fine. It didn't come bent whatsoever. The borders were not trimmed to the exact size of the logo, but I feel that's how they come so flat. If I paid 10 bucks then I would of expected it to be perfect. Im completely happy with my purchase and that's why its a 5 star rating. GO HAWKS!!!!
B0031I209W|2|I Purchase this ithem back in July for my new Scooter/bike, i order it because i dont have a garage to keep the bike, and it mention it was waterproof, well fast forward a couple of months, and the cover is not and let me make this perfectly clear is not water proof at all, after a couple of rain shower i go pull the cover off and the bike is totally wet as if it was bare with no cover on it, another thing is the cover is ripping i discover a couple of big holes near where the muffler is, i figure it might be burn holes from the muffler, but it has another hole in the back near where the license plate is, and i just discover another hole on top near where the luggage rack is, the only thing this cover might be good for is to avoid dust getting on your bike.
B001HT6BDI|5|Haven't had many miles on it yet but deff better than the stock seat that came on it when I bought this 2006 HD dyna low rider. Incredibly fast delivery  thank you<br />So far so good
B0016KA9PY|5|Product arrived quickly and as advertised. Installed on 2011 Chevrolet Silverado. Setup<br />was very simple. The Silverado was pre-wired from the factory for a brake controller. After shopping around at many local RV dealers, I found amazon offered the best price. There are many models that offer features such as a digital display, but how often are we looking at that while driving? Be ready to adjust the settings to match your trailer after install, otherwise, no issues. Very satisfied.
B008QR1ANA|4|We ordered 2 bundles of the shop towels.  We have 50 high school students taking an introduction to auto technology class at a local high school.  The towels are efficient, obsorbant and durable.  We really like the bright red color because they are easy to spot around the shop.
B00VIVXJJY|4|Purchased for my 2015 Ram 1500.  The product fit as described.  These were easy to install, I did it myself.  I like the look and feel of them.  They are not as wide as some running boards I've seen. They fit nicely without any modification.  I'm a larger guy, and they handle the weight well.
B00H1I639Q|5|Very fast service. Solid lug nuts not caps
B005U64MPS|3|First timer for drilled and slotted rotors. Initially I didn't like the the final stop fade, but got used to it. Mid range to High speed stopping power great!
B00DMWIYJW|4|Daylight Use: The Red LEDs are not really bright enough to be seen clearly during the day.<br /><br />Night Use: Once the powerful sun is gone, they emit a pleasant glow that makes them very useful as a running/marker light. They are also handy and easy to spot in your sideview mirror when backing a trailer up at night. I have mine mounted just in front of the the tires on a 5x10 trailer, it is very useful in gauging how far I am turned.<br /><br />Notes:<br />The bezel is removable, so if you don't want to use the chrome bezel it is as easy as popping the light out of it.<br /><br />The wiring comes out the back so a hole has to be drilled to run the wires as well as the mounting holes/tap. There is no accommodation to run the wiring out on the mounted side without placing pressure on the wire itself.<br /><br />Dislikes/Suggestions:<br /><br />Not a fan of having the Jesus fish plastered all over the bezel, but they look just fine without the bezel.<br /><br />The wiring insulation feels cheap, and I feel as though the mounting points should provide a ground plane, rather than having to run a wire to the nearby screw used to mount the light.<br /><br />They work well and are cheap, would recommend.
B001C6L5AA|5|Great price and has had no issues so far.  Very easy to put in although I highly recommend at least an electric impact wrench (they are cheap and run on 110V power) as it will make breaking the nuts much easier.  As these nuts are subjected to water, mud, snow, etc. they can sometimes be hard to break from the bolt.<br /><br />On safety feature I highly recommend while doing this job.  Take the tire that you just removed in order to get at this control arm and slide it under the car.  Even if you are using safety stands this adds one extra level of protection, especially for those of us that have to do repairs in gravel driveways (where safety stands aren't so stable.)<br /><br />(Just in case the descriptions does say, this is for the passenger side.)
B00C305EQK|5|The mirrors will work great for a CBR1000RR. Lights are nice and bright and has a separate running light beyond blinker didn't realize that when originally bought.
B0087XOTWW|5|I now save 90%+ on my battery power usage by converting to all LEDs in the travel trailer.  An inexpensive way to be very cost-effective and conserve valuable 12V battery life while dry camping.
B000CO9BSQ|3|It worked for the application I would have liked a heaver gauge steel as 14 or heaver
B000SOIRCG|5|Item is exactly as described and delivered on time. Haven't used it yet and can't say how long it will work, but seems to be what I was looking for, so am happy with it so far.
B000C2WDR4|5|All good
B00J51UHMQ|4|Did its job
B000R6T8NW|5|Great product
B001DRHMRI|2|Don't be mislead by the made in Germany shown on the filter. The item I received shows made in Mexico. Get a different filter if you have no confidence of the origin of manufacturing. I will go with a different brand from now on.
B008RHBJ8K|4|While I have not extensively used this tool, it does seem to work very well, is loaded with features and very easy to use. The 'fix assist' portion is not really a repair guide nor did I expect it to be one. The 'assist' messages are pretty generic saying the problem is usually caused by faulty wiring, dirty or corroded connections or a failed component. The biggest drawback is that a complete owners manual is not included. Instead you get a 'quick reference guide' in three languages that is very short and really isn't a whole lot of help. The complete manual in English has to be downloaded from the Innova website and is 100 pages. You can store it your downloads and/or print it out. I did the printing, put it in a binder with sheet protectors and made quite a nice manual. For the money spent though, I really shouldn't have had to do this. All things considered, I'm a satisfied customer.
B000C5I6FE|2|It didn't work in either of my GM vehicles. Just blew the fuses out. Might work OK for other vehicles, but not either of mine. Sent it back for a refund, no problems with Amazon at all.
B00CJ7HTNI|4|love it
B002PQW6NG|5|EASEY TO INSTALL, A 15 MINUTE JOP AND A PERFECT FIT, MAKE MY CAR LOOK NEW
B0041CDPJQ|3|Fit without leaking.  I would rather buy OEM because it has a gasket instead of a o-ring to seal it.
B00L22DG7E|5|The package came 2 days earlie, so fast shipping. The transmission bearings are nice looking, came with all bearings for the transmission, both sides of the cases. Also came with a lock washer, bushing, and hot rods sticker. Very pleased. Cheaper and better then stock yamaha bearings.
B007USGKGS|5|Hard to review an oil filter.  Seems to be working fine at the moment.  Does it give the extra protection it is claiming?  Hard to tell...  Kind of pricey but so is a new engine.
B003VLBPJA|4|I bought this for small loads, but then one day I needed to transport a 2nd helmet and gear and it stretched enough and held well enough on the hi-way, so I'm pleased with this produce. I wish it had metal clasp versus plastic as over time the plastic will break, but on the plus side it won't scratch the fairings as much like metal would.
B000VHS7PW|5|Quick easy instal on my 2013 Toyota RAV4.
B005LJ4OKW|5|They fit true and are exactly what I needed to finish my truck. They came with speed and with everything I needed to get the job done. Great job overall
B000GTY8QW|5|There's not really much to say about this item. It is what it is and it works very well. The Quality is as good or better than stock. I would buy again if needed.
B002R1ZMLM|5|They were exactly like the original lights that came in truck for half the cost of dealership.They were excellent quality.
B000E346XK|5|great thanks
B00559VNLG|5|Do exactly what they're supposed to do. Much easier to connect wire to than traditional clamp terminals.  The rings of the terminals themselves are a bit bigger than I expected though, had trouble fitting two on top of eachother for a capacitor install.
B003XET6JG|5|It was a gift for a friend who was very pleased with it. It was a gift for a friend who was very pleased with it.
B001DZFZPG|5|I bought this for my wife's car.  I can't review how well it works until she has a flat tire.  The product is well made and well packaged.  I will update this post when the time is right
B007O5GXOG|5|Excellent brake controller, easy to see and operate, and installs in a snap. Will be buying another for my SUV.
B000WJA9RS|1|Before I go onto say anything negative let me say this; this wrench will be the tool you need for a 1 time use because you can not get something undone....after that your on your own.<br />First, the ratchet is extremely heavy, I have used others that have the ratcheting handle and did not feel like I was holding a bag of bricks.<br />Second, it is not a fine tooth ratchet at all, the distance I had to travel between each time it would grab would have been a lot nicer if it was fine tooth.<br />Third, the joints to where it would bend or extend out ate horrible. I was using it in one of the extended positions and I could not rely on it stayin like that.<br />Forth, the idea of how the handle is supposed to turn the head of the wrench did not seem not work very good, it did work just not good.<br />I am not a mechanic but do spend a lot of my time under a car turning a wrench. I have used A LOT of different brands and styles of wrenches and this is not one I would buy again.
B00466P61M|5|I bought this as a gift for my guy who is a big kid at heart a year or so ago. He loved it and still wears it.
B0010E1M02|5|Easy to install in my 2006 Matrix. Had to remove just one screw to remove the glove box and get to the old filter. One tip: when removing the old filter, note which side is which. Dust, dirt, and debris will accumulate on the side that air is flowing FROM, so the airflow indicator arrow on the new filter should point away from that side (for example, if the dust is on the top of the old filter, the airflow arrow should point down). I put this filter in at the start of ragweed season, and so far my allergies are not getting unbearable while driving, which has happened in the past.
B0047PFABS|4|good quality and color didnt get the ones i wanted to get though and got two of the same
B005CLLYBQ|5|working good item 100%  Thanks ...
B006R0FKPC|4|Very good for the price!
B002J7O83C|2|I have now used these mitts to wash my car 3-4 times and have found them to be effective at washing, but are not very durable. They feel cheaply made and the green fibers come off easily when washing over rough surfaces on the vehicle. Although, for $7 I think I can live with it...
B007V2CN1O|5|high quality, good fit, good packaging and delivery, would buy again
B007QBT0WA|5|This starter installed easily and works like it should. I like the build quality and after six months of use I have confidence in the part. There were cheaper starters and they were just that cheaper. I spent a little more, still a great deal from Amazon, and feel I have gotten a better part. I would recommend this as a replacement part.
B006B201PA|5|Been through 5 yrs of racing , one small dent and a few scratches later. Going to replace it with nothing but the same. Power hit is \\"Gnarly\\"!
B0007RDVFC|2|I ran out of Eagle One \\"Wet\\" waxing my single stage paint after polishing.  I went in search of more, but found none.  I like other Mother's products and tried the Syn Wax in paste form.  The gloss level was equivalent to the Eagle One product, but as others have noted, streaking is readily apparent in full sun.  I'm very disappointed.  To answer troll reviewers who say I'm simply not using it correctly, I've got 15 yrs experience cleaning, polishing, and waxing car finishes.  I'm very aware of how to use it properly.  No amount of pressure with the microfiber cloth would take it off.  I'm going to use 3M Finesse-It to remove the wax, and come back with a full carnuba wax.
B0067ED49C|3|Missing the old style one with the top and bottom bracket, instead they used glue and tape.
B0095S5I3W|5|Part worked great.  Easy install and no problems.  Took 10 minutes to install $16 part that dealer wanted to charge $140 to fix.
B002VFQT3O|1|Real Cheap Trick fans will immediately see that only 1/3 of the logo is there.  The official Cheap Trick logo is 6 lines of \\"Cheap Trick\\" repeated in a typed font that gets slightly sloppier and harder to read.  I guess Amazon won't let me include a link, but an internet search for 'The Origin of the Cheap Trick Logo' will turn up a story about the logo on the band's official site.
B0023VKVV2|4|This could have been a super easy swap however the tail light (middle) on the new unit was a different size then the factory light.  I had to unwire the factory light assembly behind the rear bumper and wire in the new light through the same location.  Still an easy fix but took a little longer than it could have if I could have just swapped the housing out by removing the light bulbs.
B001EAQTRI|5|I recently upgraded the video card in my PC. The result was a nasty buzzing in my powered speakers (plugged into the same surge protector as the PC), especially when the video card started processing more intensely during games. Had read several suggested solutions but thought I would give this inexpensive product a try. The result? No more buzz..I don't think it was even designed for my situation but it worked perfectly. Major headache (and earache) solved.
B001CA6KK6|5|Parts were a perfect fit. No problems. Came on time.<br />I saved a lot of money doing it on my own.
B001B0QBZ6|5|This works great for my trailer hitches, its made good and lasts a long time, i would buy this again
B000KYURC2|5|I purchased this fob and a skim key at the same time. Down to the dealership I went and 15 minutes and $22 later I had another working key and fob.
B000CM3IEG|3|This is a very cheap replacement mirror.  Whether that fact is positive or negative depends upon your expectations.    Adjustment is touchy.      Night mode did not align with day mode, which I worked around by sticking a shim onto the adjustment lever.      Night mode also picks up a significant reflection from the headliner/sunroof molding.  This can be quite distracting, depending upon the angle of the headlights of the car behind me.    Is it a great mirror?  No.  Is it good enough for the price?  Yes.
B000BOHKIU|5|bought this to replace a heli coil that had finally worn out. easy to take old one out and replace
B000WAGO9Y|1|Pump worked for about 3 weeks until the on/off switch failed. The motor has gradually slowed down to where it just barely pumps more than I could by hand. Sprayed grease onto the back motor bearing and it sped up for about 2 minutes before it started slowing down-making noise again. I use it every day and don't look for it to last much longer even with the new switch. STAY AWAY!!!!!
B00OGN1WIQ|1|They did not fit the car that they were intended for. I was unable to return them as while trying to fit the first one on, it ripped at the seam. The only one that sorta fit was the back seat.
B009ETT7CU|1|Fit fine on my visor however the lights don't work, extremely disappointed
B00DEJUYBE|5|Looks great and is a much better alternative to those ugly mats that people hang from the trunk.<br />FIts nicely on my 2015 Subaru Forester and blends right in. It is a little pricey for what it is but it is the best alternative from what I've seen out there. Shipping was super fast (next day).
B00GZHXA4A|5|These are pretty easy to install and the color and brightness is excellent. I had originally ordered the 8000k and they were very blue and not quite as bright. I have them as spares now. These were installed in a 2012 Kia Optima SX. I put them in the high beams due to how dim the factory high beams are. Lows are hid anyway. I live in the country so I dont have to flip them on and off too often which i have read is bad for them. Also cars with hid lows usually leave them on when you flip on the highs so I am never without headlights while waiting for them to warm up. Warm up is about 10 seconds when they are cold but only a couple when they have been on for a minute. I would not recommend them for cars that dont have full time low beams as you would be driving blind for a few seconds when switching.<br /><br />Great pruduct, easy install, and great customer service.  These are easily 5X brighter than the factory H1 bulbs. I can see signs light up from literally a mile away at night now.<br /><br />I've only had them a few weeks and will check back in a few months from now.
B00189ARO6|5|Bestop got it right with this one.  Fits great, looks great.  It could use a bar or something across the front to keep it from sagging but I remedied that with a 2x2 and some little pieces of angle iron.  This is a good product and I would and have recommended it to my friends with jeeps.  The duster extender and windjammer are another story.
B00SYDEAB0|5|good product. It was just like the description and the delivery was quick
B003UO1IV8|4|I put these over my car's cloth seats (2004 VW Jetta) - they don't fit perfectly and do kind of wiggle around and need readjustment once in a while, but overall are pretty good. The main benefit is that due to the smooth fabric, I am able to just wipe all of the dog hairs off instead of them being embedded as they would've in cloth seats ;).
B001IB3ODA|2|I have a few RAM products and aside from this one I've been very satisfied with them. But the part that protects the screen is very poorly designed. It is so thick it makes the touch screen inoperable when in the case.  This makes it unusable in bad weather because you'd have to remove your phone from the case to interact with your phone, like you might want to do if you are using it as a GPS or to change songs when listening to music.  Also the case is just a box that holds the phone and not in any way form fitting. This is adequate but does not have the feel of a higher quality product.
B0093AQ6ZQ|5|Pricing blew away the competition and shipping time was excellent as well.  No complaints on this one! one two three (needed three more words to fill out the survey...weird)
B0061OS3HG|5|I bought theses lights saving almost half the cost of Honda parts.<br />They fit perfectly. And they work great.<br />The instructions are available at ridgelineownersclub.com
B000P7O5DG|3|Doers what it is supposed to do,
B00PBEN5PW|4|It was just what I wanted just like the picture
B000BZXSI0|4|Centric brake rotors are a solid value brand and I have these on my second car. They are quiet, have great stopping power and last a reasonably long time. These are NOT performance rotors and I would not put them on V8 corvette but on a 1994 Nissan Sentra they work great.
B00C9U3L96|5|Altima 2013 fit perfect.
B000Y89T1E|4|Using this as part of my solar setup.  I've got relays running from each of switches so the switch controls the relay and the relay handles the real power to the devices.  The fuses in this unit are just a bonus to protect the relays.<br /><br />One star off because one of the fuse holders broke (and the fuses are spring loaded so it went flying) but was easily fixed with some super glue.
B001L50Y9K|5|Easy to hook up sounds good.
B0080KN7RU|4|Goes on easy enough but does not have the shinny coating to make me think it would last on the rear window of my truck. Having said that it is and stand-out addition to my nagalene water bottle and always draws attention.
B00D7EN2VA|5|I have been using this in the city of Austin now for about 60 days and love it-- so far.  Here is what I found:<br />1- Saves time- no more having to look for change or pay at a pay station then go back and put a sticker on you car.<br />2- Saves money- Only pay for the time you use, no wasting of money by overloading the meter.<br />3- Convenient- Just park & go<br />4- Peace of mind- no more worrying about getting a ticket just because you underestimated how long you would be parked.<br />I am a regular shopper on Amazon, but for whatever reason,I did not by this device here but got it from the EasyPark website.  I have not gotten any tickets since using the device but obviously I cannot say whether is from using the device or not. Also- I think the complaint the other reviewer has is due to Austin city parking limitations- not from EasyPark.  In other words if there is a 3 hour parking limit posted by the city, that 3 hour limit applies no matter what method of payment.
B001KS2PXQ|2|Easy to install but doesn't touch the whole rear window.  Covers maybe 2/3rds of the bottom part of the window. Seems like wiper is too stiff to make the curve.  6 months later no improvement. So buy something else if available.  I have the 2006 Mazda 5.
B005C74XM2|4|Good quality product with a nice glossy finish. The adhesive was strong enough for me to remove it and reapply during installation because I didn't put it on straight the first time.
B006GFLI0O|1|Trash !!!
B004PL1Q0I|5|sweet deal great product
B000C5GAUM|5|As expected
B000GZAUQ8|5|My 2007 Honda Accord uses these Iridium plugs. Recommended maintenance interval is 100,000 miles but I just have a hard time buying that. I keep close tabs on my gas mileage, so when I see it start to dip, I use that as a signal. Some may say that's ridiculous, but my mpg numbers support my position. My mpg will dip almost 5 mpg and it immediately comes back with a new set of plugs. The old plugs are coated with carbon, the stems show heat deterioration just as the older version of plugs. I think I'll err on the side of caution and continue to replace plugs on my schedule.
B000CITK8S|5|Works well, only use it on my motorcycle.
B00K3G05II|5|Truck started right up.
B0085OLNP4|5|Very cute well made
B00067MVBS|1|I ordered this because of the following on the website<br /><br />Mounts into a 2 inch receiver (maximum capacity 500 pounds)<br />Adjustable for large to small bikes<br />Easy to use loading ramp<br />Black powder-coat finish<br />Steel platform and ramp<br />› See more product details<br /><br />This is an item that only has a 300 pound capacity; not 500; not 400; etc. It says on the box that it fits dirt bikes up to 300 pounds.  In my view there is complete misrepresentation and they lie to you to sell it how did they do in making it or having it fabricated?<br />I received a package from Amazon promptly although it was totally banged up and taped on the corners etc. The UPS person didn't even bother caring it up the stairs one flight but dropped it off in our hallway.<br />I of course immediately called Amazon to pick it up and would not shop with the seller again.
B001D20X4W|5|So much better deal than parts stores or oil change stores
B001JEE2TG|5|Factory fit and engine light is off
B00THR39SC|1|They did not fit my truck at all, I called and emailed the company so I could return them but have not heard back. I am very disappointed!
B008QDKMKQ|4|It does the job in tight places.
B00HVI7426|5|Fits great.
B000C7Z84E|5|Once I determined the item I needed, I started shopping around. I was amazed to find this product at this price, which was almost half the cost of the local suppliers. Delivery was excellent and down time was minimized.
B00D42AFS8|1|Worked for less than one month as a USB charger and then quit working. I charged the device no more than 10 times. Never used as a jumper.  This item failed very fast. I feel so much  like I've been taken into a dark alley and robbed that my head actually hurts.
B00FNJQ0ZM|3|The middle links are very flimsy and will break. I replaced the actual key chain part with a sturdier one while only keeping the rubber Honda Logo.
B001C5Y4FE|5|reduced the noise in my husband's GMS 2006 truck. He also installed a new plastic lower steering column bearing at the same time, so hard to tell which, if not both in combination, solved the problem.  Glad to have done it though.
B007V2CZAI|5|I have one of these for each of my cars and they can not be beat. Perfect fit and super durable. Highly recommend!
B00CF881FQ|3|While the sticker design itself isn't bad, it's not what I expected.  I ordered two of these.  they are not vinyl.  Instead, they are screened on clear plastic.  With what this person charges for shipping, I expected better...
B000C1OWWE|5|I enjoy doing much of the required preventive maintenance myself - this gives me the opportunity to select high quality parts and these pads were a perfect fit, high quality and reasonably priced!
B00B25Y9GI|1|Completely unhappy with what arrived i was expecting the.stator with the blue.covering instead i recived the.stator worth $43 on amazon. it has a electro sport cover on the box but whats in the pakage is not what i seen in the picture completely. I will not buy from this seller again. 1 star because i have to to make a review and.also a fast delivery. But omce again.it is.not.what u see on the picture.
B008MKLK0E|5|fits and works great
B000SOKE5E|5|Heard good things..it's in my (just if ) I need it supplies.
B00265FXFY|4|This same bulb was going for $99 at my local AutoZone.  As much as I'd love to give the local guys business I just couldn't bring myself to pay that knowing I could get it on Amazon for $50.  Great bulb and perfect fit once I pulled my tire and got up inside the wheel well.  About 15-20 minutes end to end.  Older cars were much more simpler....  Overall I figured I saved myself at least $200 buying the bulb on Amazon and replacing myself.
B0072KQR44|1|Ad does not list width or length or thickness of the product. Not real obvious how one selects color either.
B00H3TMS7E|5|GREAT MERCHANDISE
B001O7WLL4|5|Producto de buena calidad, y a un precio bastante competente.<br />El envío del producto fue rápido y sin ninguna complicación.
B006JG5BLM|5|While in Florida for 3 months and due to a slow leak (finally found a small nail), was putting in a pound or two of air into a tire every few weeks, and darn but the gas stations nearby all charged about $1 for air.  Got this unit and it works great.  Eliminates driving to gas station for air and the annoying $1 charge.<br /><br />I like that the hose screws onto the tire valve so there is no question about leaking air when attaching and removing it.  Pump is sufficiently powerful to get tire back up to desired pressure pretty quickly.  I'd definitely buy this again ... and expect this one to last for many years of very occasional use.  Comes with a nice carry bag.
B006Z4IR5K|3|We would have preferred that you can stick inside the car...but this needs to be pasted outside.  So I put it where bumper is....wish the size was little larger since you can only see it when you are very close to the car
B00IWNKK0M|2|Although the part fits..the groove for the O-ring is a bit touchy..you have to place it in just right or else it will leak..didn't have the problem with the factory one..but maybe that's why it's cheap?  If the problems continues at the next oil change, I'll just buy the aluminum one.
B0013CRFD4|5|The color is right on . good product
B00RIV1H42|5|Fits the BMW 325xi perfectly! Everything lined up. Also included the screws, others didn't! Received quickly with 2-day shipping.
B0000BX6RG|4|It was suggested to put the teak oil on it to save it and I used it, and also used it on my other wooden outdoor furniture
B000C9SJUC|5|I just bought this for the little leash deal but figured i'd just replace the cap while I was at it. Works good, fits, no problems.
B0039L9PSU|2|Broke on first use
B00A49LZDS|3|I chose three stars. The color match was great however when using the color pen the wick simply dropped out of the pen. Not entirely a bad product but was a little frustrated that the paint pen wick dropped out when I was using it.
B000WGNNUQ|4|So far the unit has been operating as expected. Power out is clean and has been able to handle most loads.<br />I did remove the rubber feet on the device and secured it to a platform. I am using this inverter in my SUV as a camping power source. Have had no issues so far.
B00DNDIPV2|5|This may be the funniest looking air freshener that I have ever purchased, but that was the whole idea.  We love it.
B001B08IAC|1|I fogged a car I bought that smelled like Cigarettes. and in the beginning it smelled fine but after about a week the cigarettes smell started to come back mixed with the fogger smell....It was sooooo bad that I just wanted to get rid of the car...Thankfully my father in law had a OZONE machine which took out every smell that was in this car.
B000GV1RV4|4|Great low and midrange power!
B0009VF1DQ|4|Overall this is a convenient and well-made product that I would recommend. Having it in the glove box makes it easy to keep my interior dust-free. However, a couple of small issues to note:<br /><br />- Give it a few good whacks before using it the first time, or it may leave small amounts of red lint behind.<br /><br />- Some surfaces seem to suck lint out of it regardless. The matte vinyl areas of my dash have this (very minor) issue.<br /><br />- The handle interferes a bit when I try to dust the dash where it meets the windshield. (This depends on the angle of your car's windshield. I used this duster on a 2012 Hyundai Elantra.) I find I have to angle the handle down or it will tap/slide on the glass. Wrapping the whole thing in microfiber when I do the far edge works as well.<br /><br />These are small complaints; the most important thing is that this product works--it grabs the dust and gets into most tricky spots effortlessly.
B000CM0WWW|1|mirror came today,and it does not fit inside the rim of the existing mirror but sits on the rim of the original,leaving a space between the two mirrors.It comes with 2 self adhesive strips,but they are not thick enough to bridge the gap between the two mirrors.Useless!Found out that the heated mirrors I have are 1/8th\\" smaller than these (why would any car maker do this!!!) Insanity on Buicks part.Got the correct one,and fits perfectly.
B0053H8MKK|4|Put right in and it works hadn't had any problems yet
B00068XCQU|5|great price. works really well. everyone with a bike should own one.
B000BUY0EQ|4|Sounds great on an older 5.0 liter and comes in at a great price. The fitment was pretty flawless for a bolt in exhaust. I didn't need to do any custom work. Just took time to move the pipes around until everything was lined up perfectly. The only thing better than this is having a shop custom bend and weld pipes for you.
B007H2RFOS|1|I have an aluminium horse trailer with average, normal white small pithing from age corrosion.  It is a 1999, but this product touts it's ability to clean and brighten this aluminium.  It doesn't.  Read the directions extensively.  Tried applying several times, nothing worked.  It did not perform at all.
B00J5AS1YI|1|Was the wrong ones
B001GN1GLM|5|Works great.  Even bought a second one.
B004ZF445S|5|easy to install only took 15 mins. DO IT YOURSELF  (diy) very simple. only a dummy cannot put the male end into the female ends, and the light in the socket. great look to my car as well
B00CIN471A|4|It worked fine for me.  The spring could be better secured on the tool but it really isn't all that necessary for the operation of the pliers to even have a spring.  My canvases , some quite large, are like drum heads they're so tight.
B002DW256A|5|When I ordered the cargo cover I didn't think it was an actual 'need', just something to dress up the car.  However, now that I have it I can't believe I waited so long to get one.  Since the rear/hatchbackof the Insight is 90% glass all the things you carry around are totally visible.  My new cargo cover gives a clean, uncluttered look.  Love it!
B0085OKJZ4|5|Really nice key chain. Very heavy and durable.  Not cheap!
B007ISZN9A|4|Used on 4x4 suburban, best illumination on road and off road, originals headlamps looks like candles in comparison, I felt high priced, for that I deduct one star, I recommend if you like to see clear and have the budget.
B006XGHMT2|5|Perfect! Desoldered the old motors ans soldered in the new ones and now I have gauges that function like new.
B00Y3J485C|3|Wires are really small and the 3m tape isn't very sticky. Had them for a month 1 led burnt out
B000EA5WLS|5|Awesome, was able to fix about 4 chips on multiple vehicles. Great product would buy it again.
B0024E6V9E|5|does its job well.  keeps the filter where you place it.  the foot push down bar is a big help.  this braket keeps the filter straight and keeps the hose where it is placed .  great item
B001L9ZBZS|5|This was a gift and the price was right
B00CF280LM|5|Excellent upgrade to my Honda Odyssey -- like night and day (literally). High quality product. Seems solid, with all the right wiring and adapters for various OEM configurations. This Xeonon set was definitely worth the price differential relative to the $45 Xenon units.
B00GLLW3AM|5|They arrived as described and on time & look well built. I have not installed the yet, so I can't say how they work. Will update the review when the are installed
B004G7TPQS|2|Worked fine for one winter, but this winter it died, I would expect it to last longer then one season.  Don't know if it had a warranty the paper work is long gone. So its useful life is shorter then a camera flash!
B00513G82U|2|I was as excited to find this as anyone, but when it came, I was disappointed.<br />The installation part is a problem from go. It comes with no mounting hardware and no means to connect it to the bike so you need a package shelf, flat (no rim) that is big enough to support this thing. Then you have to drill it out and find mounting hardware that will be suitable to connect it to your package shelf, you are on your own to design and install. If you are that handy, good.<br /><br />The next problem is that it looks and feels cheap and flimsy. The backrest pad is thin vinyl and the gauge of the shell is thin, thin, thin. I do not want my lady leaning back on this flimsy piecs feeling like she is safe, it is definitely not sturdy to offer any support to the passenger.<br /><br />Last, the finish. It's wavy, swirls in the paint, the edges are rough, the metal trim is cheap and will rust easily, also, thin and flimsy, I would not secure a sleeping bad to this and expect it not to tear off in the wind.
B005SB0JJS|5|Fit perfect on my 2011 Wrangler Unlimited.  Makes it look better and no more foggy windows in the rain.  I've had them a few months and on a black vehicle in the sun during summer the adhesive tape shows no signs of failing.  Very good purchase for my Jeep.
B000MK2C7W|3|Performance and looks are top notch they just didnt have in mind people might have tb spacers and aftermarket tb also. Had to cut a notch in hood liner so it would fit and make new hardware for install. So a 30 min affair with the 3 items ended up a 2 day project. Was installed on an 96 GMC C1500 5.7
B000VVZ2I8|5|Dude. I bought one of these puppies with my $450 tax return. What an awesome investment. Now my pontiac sunfire will do radical burnouts in reverse! I'm so happy i bought this product. Now I can smoke all my buddies with their stupid ricers and cold air intakes. I may even need to take off my radials this summer and put on some snow tires with studs for maximum carnage grip baby.  Ronnie Mac aint got nuthin on me now! Now i just need to buy a spoiler and some sweet beadlock rims from Sears and my ride will be the fastest in tri-county area!
B005NXMFW0|5|fits my 2012 jeep rubicon 2 dr perfectly.  does not slip off when I open the console and feels much better than the stock console.  I would definitely buy this again.
