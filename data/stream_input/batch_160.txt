6304233639|5.0|Okay I know that the title will get many devouted Star wars fans upset and angry and yell &quot;What do you mean this is better then Star Wars?!&quot;  Well Star Wars just didint capture me.  It was OK in my opinion but not that good.  Now Independence day is a fantastic movie that will hook you in the first minute of playing.  Let me say this right off the bat.  This movie has the BEST movie soundtrack I have EVER heard.  It is incredebly patriotic and moving.  It sets the mood perfectly and grips you the minute you hear it.  It is so good in fact, you might expect it to be blasted over big speakers during WWIII battles.  The special effects are spectacular.  The &quot;fire wall&quot; sequence will scare the bejebers out of you.  You will probably be terrified because you feel so sorry for all the people and annimals who face that thing.  The jet-to-alien fighter sequences are stunning.  They may be the best air attack seqeunces ever.  The story is good and moving and will keep you engrossed to the very end.  The last hour or so are by far the best.  The moments when Jeff Goldbloom and Will Smith zoom up into the alien head ship is just incredible.  The last jet battle is incredeble and extreamly well done.  The music also helps a lot here, with incedibly patrisam and heroic tunes.  Overall this is a fantastic movie that should not be missed.<br />The Good: The BEST soundtrack EVER made (In my opinion) Stunning attack sequences, awsome special effects<br />The Bad: Some moments are too heart grippingly sad and tragic.<br />And the Ugly: None!
B000002W9Q|3.0|This Cd is cool.  I went out and bought it as soon as i could.  The tunes are happening and are great to listen to at sleepovers and just when iam on my own.  Me and my friends quote all the best one liners and sing the songs even when the CD is not playing.   What i like best about this CD is i know when the songs come into the movie.  If you love this CD go out and get the Collector's Edition. It has 27 songs on it!!
B00005B4GU|5.0|Words really can't describe how I feel about Radiohead's newest Cd AMNESIAC.  I could give it a five star rating based on the first five songs alone.  The only one complaint I have is I wish they would have not put an alternate take of Morning Bell on Amnesiac, I would have rather heard one song that was in the vault.  &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; is truely a great song.  &quot;You and Whose Army?&quot; is my favorite track by far with a crescendo that is brilliant and will leave you hoping that the track was a few minutes longer (only 3 minutes long, but it goes by fast.) &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot; is &quot;p&quot;hat the beats are very bumping. Don't go trying to comprehend the lyrics, the only one you'll understand in &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot; is the line about trapdoors.  That is what makes it so beautiful in my mind.  Very seldom nowadays can you buy an album and be satisfied with just the music, they more or less depend on the words.  Radiohead has done that with both KID A and AMNESIAC, making the music the vocal point.  To be honest sometimes listening to this album I wish Thom Yorke didn't sing and just let the music flow.  Compared to KID A it is not nearly as dark, it has its similarites to &quot;the Bends&quot;  but is not as epic as &quot;OK Computer&quot; (very few groups can even have one as epic as this.) I would definitely put it up there with &quot;Ok Computer&quot; as the 2nd best album they've done.  I'm just amazed that they can keep putting out fantastic albums like this.
B000005JA8|5.0|It's terribly simple to overrate the album usually regarded as Beefheart's masterpiece of masterpieces. But you would have an impossible time finding anything across the whole spread of rock and damn near any other form of music which so gleefully yanked the rules inside out while remaining, as peculiar as it might sound to those who've bought the legend before the fact in the grooves, truer to a bluesy core (believe it or not: Captain Beefheart and his Magic Band actually began as a blues group and a highly individualistic one at that, as any hearing of &quot;The Legendary A&amp;M Sessions,&quot; &quot;Safe As Milk,&quot; and &quot;The Mirror Man Sessions&quot; should tell you) than most of the bloozaboogie meatheads who were getting respect for &quot;reviving&quot; the blues in the same era. That Beefheart saw that core as a proper launch toward free-form impressionism testifies to his vision, even if &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot; has just a few moments where excess supplants excellence. (Taken on another level, the single-album &quot;Lick My Decals Off, Baby&quot; - &quot;Trout Mask&quot; had been a two-record set - could be seen as the album &quot;Trout Mask&quot; would have been had it been edited down considerably.) Even now, however, &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot; and damn near everything in the man's repertoire cements Captain Beefheart as perhaps the only legitimate claimant among any rock musician to the title of &quot;alternative&quot;.
B00000ADG2|4.0|I liked Lauryn Hill so much in The Fugees, I had to get her first solo album. I was blown away after one listening! This album showcases her rap skills and wonderful singing vioce. Even the interludes between songs are bearable!! Of course &quot;Doo Wop (That Thing)&quot; is one of my favorites, where she shows off both of her talents. The harmonies are incredible!! Other faves include &quot;Ex-Factor&quot;, &quot;I Used To Love Him&quot; (a duet with Mary J. Blige), and &quot;Final Hour&quot;. The two I did not enjoy were &quot;Superstar&quot; and her duet with D'Angelo, &quot;Nothing Even Matters&quot;(&quot;NEM&quot; is just too long!!). This CD is a must for anyone who likes hip-hop, R&amp;B, and/or (light) rap. Get your &quot;(Mis-)Education&quot; from Lauryn, and it will be tuition well-spent!
B00003CXP1|3.0|Ellen Burstyn shines in this disturbing film about the lives of four people and their addiction to drugs.  The acting and writing is excellent, though this movie was a little too &quot;weird&quot; for my tastes.  This film is very disturbing and well done, but I don't think it lives up to all of the praise it received.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Wow.. where do you begin with Fight Club? Well, let me start with: &quot;I have never read the book.&quot; That having been said, this movie is one of the my favorite movies ever, and it's a pity that it wasn't given a better reception by critics and fans alike when it came out. <br />From a strictly filmmaking point of view, Fight Club uses a variety of interesting storytelling tehcniques that help build the story, and carry the unreality of what we're seeing. The ending makes you want to go back and see it again, just to figure out what you missed, and yes, it does all fit together when you watch again, in fact it fits in so well, you're amazed you didn't see the ending coming. <br />As for the DVD itself, it's impeccable. The video transfer is damn near perfect.. if you think you see blotches on the screen every once in a while, look again.. trust me! :) The colors are a bit dark, but is done intentionally, and helps keep the mood. The sound is unreal.. you don't just listen to it, you immerse yourself in it, letting it surround you. Great use of all 5.1 channels.<br />This DVD would be worth the price just for the movie itself... but, it's packed to the gills with extras features! Damn near information overload here... 4 seperate commentary tracks, deleted scenes, domestic, internationl and Internet trailers, hidden spoof catalogue, storyboards..the list goes on and on. <br />People tend to either love Fight Club or hate it... but most everyone I know says it was a movie to think about, and that alone is reason enough to check it out. It is by far the best thing to come out of Hollywood in many years.
B000001ESJ|5.0|Rush has always been a band of albums and not hit singles, so when they became the next big thing in progressive rock with 2112, it was due to the album as a whole (particularly the title suite) not just one solitary song. But I guess Rush must have been a bit worn out from the extravagant \\"2112\\" for the follow-up A FAREWELL TO KINGS has them scaling things back a little bit, and not a moment too soon. Because honestly, can someone get more pretentious (I mean good pretentious, not bad) than \\"2112\\"? Just about every song on here is worth noting, even if two of them haven't gone on to become major classics like the other four on here. The title track has them again condensing their prog aspirations into a finely-crafted, well-written 5-minute song, and succeeding admirably. Granted, the subject of royalty vs. peasantry is the stuff worthy of a miniseries, but Rush says all that needs to be said, thank Heavens. At the end of \\"Kings\\", there's a mention of \\"Closer To The Heart\\", a short little 3-minute song that apparently may have been intended as a filler, but instead has gone on to become one of Rush's most popular songs, appearing on all four of the band's live albums. It worked for Black Sabbath's \\"Paranoid\\", so there's no reason why it shouldn't with Rush. Geddy Lee has thankfully done more bass-playing than songwriting, but sometimes he can come up with something worthy of Neil Peart, and he does on FAREWELL with \\"Cinderella Man\\". Apparently a big movie buff, Lee sets the classic Frank Capra film MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN to music quite successfully, and had it been written back in the 1930s, chances are the song would have found its way into the movie. Excellent work right there, and too bad it remains one of Rush's most unsung works. In the way of epics, they repeate CARESS OF STEEL's method of including two, but while that album took prog rock's tendency for bombast to the nth degree, FAREWELL contains some more modest works like \\"Xanadu\\" and \\"Cygnus X-1\\". Both of those songs became concert favorites, and work just as well as \\"2112\\" did, and in half the time, too. While A FAREWELL TO KINGS wasn't as cinematic as 2112, it showed that Rush could do both large and small works with ease.f those songs became concert favorites, and work just as well as \\"2112\\" did, and in half the time, too.

B00005BL2A|5.0|I never thought they would top &quot;Some Great Reward&quot;,&quot;Black Celebration&quot; or &quot;Violator&quot;. It is probably too soon to say, but I think this could end up as my favorite Depeche c.d. Three weeks after &quot;Exciter&quot; was released I am even more into it.      &quot;Dream On&quot;, the first song, is still getting better with each listen. It's kind of a cross between &quot;World In My Eyes&quot; and &quot;Personal Jesus&quot;. Also, I've yet to hear a bad remix of this song.      &quot;Shine&quot;, &quot;The Sweetest Condition&quot; and &quot;When The Body Speaks&quot; are all above average mid-tempo songs.      &quot;The Dead Of Night&quot; took me a few listens to decide on. It stops just short of being kind of silly. Also, by this point on the c.d. you'll be wondering why this c.d. was reported as being largely acoustic. This c.d. contains more electronic blips and bleeps than I've ever heard on a Depeche album.      &quot;Freelove&quot;-Good song.      &quot;Comatose&quot; is the other song I had to listen to several times. Now I look forward to this song. Martin sings this one and the music otherworldly.       &quot;I Feel Loved&quot; will make it hard to argue that Depeche is not a dance band if it is the next single. It may be the danciest song they've ever recorded.      &quot;Breathe&quot;, another Martin vocal, is an excellent song. It does have the feel of a torch song.      &quot;I Am You&quot; has a surging bass line going underneath a mellow song. My favorite moments on the whole album are at the end of this song. After the final words are sung majestic strings swell up out of nowhere and then give way to a sound that still makes my dogs run from the room.      The final song, &quot;Goodnight Lovers&quot; has a classic D.M. feel. The base of the song is hummed vocals kind of like the intro to &quot;Leave In Silence&quot;.      After three weeks, I have yet to start skipping any of the songs on this c.d. It is consistently excellent from beginning to end. Dave sings and sounds better than he ever has and the songs are powerful. The power in these songs doesn't come from beats-per-minute, it comes from emotion and excellent performance and production. Please work with Mark Bell again-soon, not four years from now! Thank you for making an album that makes me feel like I did almost seventeen years ago when I listened to &quot;Some Great Reward&quot; for the first of many times. I've always had something to do from that moment on.
B0000033RY|3.0|Question: What do you get when - after he's God-fool enough to want to hook up with one of the all-time calcified-spine rhythm sections of rock - Jeff Beck leaves said rhythm section in the lurch after a near-fatal automobile accident? Answer: You get a very different Cactus than the one bassist Tim Bogert and drummer Carmine Appice had in mind in the first place. (They first dreamed up the name after Beck invited the erstwhile Vanilla Fudge rhythm section to form a new band with him - and with Rod Stewart, at least until money differences supposedly split the two, shoving Stewart toward joining buddy Ron Wood in what was left of the original Small Faces.)<br />Exit Stewart and Beck, enter Rusty Day (vocals, harmonica) and former Detroit Wheel Jim McCarty (ok, quick - how many people who were there heard the name and first thought the Yardbirds' drummer of the same name had switched instruments) on guitar. And, whatever Cactus might have been in the planning turned out very different in the actuality. I can remember people describing the band as something along the line of Led Zeppelin on benzedrine, and it's not exactly inaccurate, considering Zeppelin trap-smasher John Bonham owed practically every degree of his sound and attack to Appice's thunderboomer style. Cactus was also as riff-happy as the early Zeppelin, but they lacked the British foursome's well-enough developed sense of dynamics.  Cactus was about as subtle as a pileup on the New Jersey Turnpike and proud of it, which works if you have something deeper than just your basic bloozaboogie on which to stand - and they didn't.<br />Not all of it was exactly bad, but this lot's reputation for obstreperousness (not to mention one of the most forgettable lead singers of their time, though Day was an interesting enough harmonica blower occasionally) isn't entirely unjustified. Call them the Dave Kingmans of early-1970s hard rock - a textbook exercise in using power without larger purpose, except that Dave Kingman hit an awful lot more home runs than Cactus hit consistent recordings. (&quot;Restrictions&quot; was steadiest, most interesting, and least obstreperous of the original lineup's regulation-issue albums, not to mention the one Cactus album whose sound suggested something of what the band might have been had the original game plan with Stewart and Beck survived; it would be no shame if that album were to be reissued.) <br />This anthology, though, is workable enough for anyone who just has to have a sampling of Cactus in the home library. And, at least, it was sensible enough to include their most cheerfully berserk track, their rubber-room-insane version of &quot;Parchman Farm,&quot; the Mose Allison song which had already been beaten practically to death - Cactus, effectively, puts the poor critter out of its misery, even if Jim McCarty is offering a pretty good reason as to why, when it came time to spin out that classic psychedelic-blues guitar lick that bridges &quot;Devil With A Blue Dress&quot; to &quot;Good Golly Miss Molly&quot; on that unforgettable Detroit Wheels single, the job was handed off to uncredited guest slinger Mike Bloomfield. McCarty didn't lack chops, but that is practically all his playing tells you. In due enough course, Day and McCarty bailed out and Bogert and Appice sallied forth for a little more. They recruited singer Pete French, guitarist Werner Fritzschings, and keyboard ace Duane Hitchings, and cranked out &quot;'Ot and Sweaty,&quot; half live (and pretty snappy at that; this lineup wasn't even half as pretentious as their predecessor lineup and showed some surprising sensibilities) and half in the studio (comparatively lame, but we're not exactly talking about Led Zeppelin, here).<br />Then, Bogert and Appice bolted for an at-long-last union with Jeff Beck which ended up producing a fair amount of hype and re-anticipation. It also produced exactly the kind of album you would expect from a union triggered, in the first place, by the guitarist being impressed with the rhythm section on the absolute bottom of Vanilla Fudge's barrel (the legend had it that Beck got wise to Bogert and Appice while listening to &quot;Near the Beginning&quot;). The less said, the better, and even Jeff Beck knows it. French, Fritzschings and Hitchings, meanwhile, were actually fool enough to keep Cactus going anyway. The so-called New Cactus Band cut one album of the same name, which made an excellent Frisbee but that was about the extent of it. I still can't remember which happened first, the album hitting the cutout bins or the New Cactus Band drying up and blowing away forever.
0060392886|4.0|Gee.....I don't particularly care for Motley Crues music but this book is something special. Tales of debauchery and self inflicted pain is all over this book. At the same time it brings the life of a rock star to a human level. Childhood, teenage years, marraiges, parenthood are as much a part of this book as the music. I particularly think that Nikki Sixx's confessions are real and poignant. This book should be a part of any rock fan's library.
B000056K04|5.0|Before this album I liked DMB.  Now having bought this album, I am a HUGE fan!  With each album the are continuing to grow as artists and producing more incredible music.  I promise you will not find a better CD this year from start to finish.  If you don't think the band is happy with this CD, check out their Rolling Stone interview from earlier this year.  They are, and should be, very proud of this album!
B000001ESF|5.0|After three albums of finding their main line, Canadian rockers Rush at last discovered it with 2112. This was the album that most Americans got into Rush with, and that was good because the band finally learned how to play the progressive rock game after the stilted CARESS OF STEEL. That album contained a sidelong suite that tried hard on the listener's patience, but 2112 is a bit easier to take this time around. A complex and heavily-veiled piece of musical literature inspired by Ayn Rand, &quot;2112&quot; would have sounded like just another progressive rock epic in the hands of any other band besides Rush. But because Rush appealed to the intellectual side of most rock fans, &quot;2112&quot; was something that only Rush could have done with a straight face. What makes &quot;2112&quot; so good is that for 1976, the storyline about something so simple as a guitar would become obsolete in the far-ahead year of 2112 was ahead of its time. However, in this age of MP3s, minidiscs, and the whole Napster debate, &quot;2112&quot; sounds a lot like the time we're living in now. Perhaps we have become too dependent on technology to make our lives easier, that eventually the machines our intelligence built will make that intelligence a thing of the past. &quot;2112&quot; proves that Rush sang and wrote about a future that had a very logical chance of coming true, not something that was strictly out of a Tolkien novel. Luckily, this work has remained an integral part of Rush's live show, with it recently being performed in its entirety for the first time in over 2 decades. I'd get tuckered out after playing a 20-minute-long song, too, wouldn't you? For side 2, it's back to good old-fashioned song structure, and after letting Neil Peart for the most part do the lyric-writing on CARESS OF STEEL (and getting ahead of himself in the process), Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson are back in the songwriting seat again. While their early songs were underdeveloped, and often downright embarassing, Geddy and Alex must have learned a few things since taking on Neil Peart for their songs are a bit more thoughtful than before. Lifeson's &quot;Lessons&quot; is another prog-rock affair compressed into a single-worthy 3 minutes. This song about &quot;the student becoming the teacher&quot; is one that will ring true for anyone still in school (and even now, Rush's fan base includes more than a few young adults). Lee's &quot;Tears&quot; showed that he had stopped aping Led Zeppelin with a tender, even romantic love song that is a few steps above your average power ballad. Geddy's vocals on here predate the more restrained voice he would adopt on Rush's '80s work. Speaking of which, Neil Peart begins to create songs on 2112 that would come in handy when they abandoned progressive rock's conventions for the most part in the 1980s. &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; takes a while to register, but &quot;A Passage To Bangkok&quot; and &quot;Something For Nothing&quot; prove that whenever Neil isn't worrying about the future of mankind, he can create earthbound rock songs that one doesn't have to be a fan of Yes to wholly appreciate. 2112 established Rush as a progressive rock giant both on record and on stage, as their first live album ALL THE WORLD'S A STAGE would prove. It couldn't have been with a better one for 2112 shows that Rush were no longer the eager young boys that had wanted to become Canada's version of Zeppelin.ssing, Geddy and Alex must have learned a few things since taking on Neil Peart for their songs are a bit more thoughtful than before.

B000001DV2|5.0|Adrenalize was the first Def Lep album I got and in addition to getting me into them in a big way, it started my love of rock on a whole as well!  [It must be good,] yep,it's the probably the best collection of songs by Def Leppard, not as many hits as Hysteria but it's prably still my favorite.  Classics like Lets Get Rocked, White Lightning, Heaven Is, Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad etc along with amazing ballads like Tonight make it a varied and fun album.  Buy Hysteria if you are getting into the Leps for the first time but get this second.  Amazing stuff from those Sheffield boys!

B000059Z8J|5.0|I've been waiting for this dvd for many years now, and I'm happy to say that I'm NEVER again watching that laughable Pan N Scan version!!<br />The picture quality is better than I expected. First of all, all the grain that was current in some scenes are gone, and not to mention the green suits! The widescreen version is ofcourse an improvment from the awfull pan n scan version, and I have to say that this movie looks absolutely beutiful in widesreen!<br />The new 5.1 sourround sound is fantastic! It's great to hear the sound coming out of all your speakers. The &quot;bullet, fire and Ice&quot; scene is recomended to those who own a dolby 5.1 system!<br />When you think that new sound and improved picture quality was enough, you thought wrong. The disc(two sides) is loaded with extras! There's three documenteries, Taking Flight:The Development of Superman, Filming the Legend:The Making of Superman, and The Magic Behing the Cape:Special Effects. There's also a commentary track starring director Richard Donner, and Creative Consaultant Tom Mankewicz, aswell as three trailers(one teaser, a trailer and a TV spot). There's also screentest's of Christopher Reeve(Superman), Sahra Douglas(Ursa) and Margot Kidder(Margot Kidder). And for those who don't own the Superman The Movie Rihno soundtrack, then there's also some alternate music not included on the film.<br />This is one of the best DVD's ever made! Highly recomended!
B00005B4GU|3.0|I wanted this album bad, but when I got it I felt like screaming. Radiohead took a differant path with Kid A but now it seems like their lost on that path. Songs just aren't any good. I own every radiohead album and this one is right next to Pablo Honey, in terms of quality.
B000001ES9|3.0|From my eyes, Canada has always been a slightly larger, more cultured version of the U.S.A. After all, they once were under the British Crown, and one of its provinces would rather call themselves citizens of France than England. So I guess before the early 1970s, when bands like April Wine & The Guess Who proved that the Canadians could rock, Canada wasn't thought to be a hub for rock & roll. Another band that joined those two bands in the Canadians' search for a piece of the rock action was Rush. Of course, Rush wouldn't stay in the hard rock vein for long. They're now considered to be one of the better progressive rocks bands to have ever existed, something I would certainly agree on. But before Rush even approached the pomposity of prog rock, their debut album showed that they wanted to just plain rock, and had they stayed that way, we wouldn't have heard more from them. This version of Rush had not yet had Neil Peart to provide the lyrics and sci-fi imagery that would become their stock in trade. So the two founding members Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson did the bulk of the songwriting early on, and RUSH shows that the two were in desperate need of a sounding board. Songs like \\"In The Mood\\", \\"What You're Doing\\" and \\"Need Some Love\\" are of the \\"yeah-we're-in-a-band-so-let's-some-write-some-songs-to- get-some-girls\\" type that your average teenage rocker would pen. Of course, the members of Rush were a bit older than teenagers by this time. Also, the complaints about Geddy Lee's easily-wearing singing voice are somewhat founded on here with his Robert Plant-soundalike delivery. For someone who had first heard Lee's more understated voice on Rush's prog-based music, this was worse than nails on a blackboard. However, RUSH does have a few songs that would go on to become concert standards for years to come. The opening \\"Finding My Way\\" and the closing \\"Working Man\\" (still in the playlist 25 years later) display hints of the classic music to come. And it's hard to believe Neil Peart had not yet joined Rush, but he could have easily penned those two songs had he been around. For classic Rush fans though, Peart's joining was just around the bend. During the tour in support of Rush's debut, drummer John Rutsey was dismissed, and along came Peart and much better things for the band. But those who listen to RUSH won't believe that before Rush became purveyors of thinking man's hard rock, they could have easily faded into obscurity had they stayed with the sound on here.e Neil Peart had not yet joined Rush, but he could have easily penned those two songs had he been around.

B00004YW6I|5.0|This cd was my first introduction to PJ - it is incredible. She is one of the most talented and interesting songwriters around today, and boy, can she rock! (She has been compared to Patti Smith - although she's a little more focused; and on this recording, at least, more optimistic). I highly recommend this to anyone who likes their singer-songwriters to have an edge, wit, intelligence and who can play the guitar with the very best of them.  Stand out tracks: A Place Called Home, Good Fortune, Kamikaze. (but they're all fantastic). You will not be disappointed if you purchase this cd.
B00005BL2A|5.0|Give them a break! Depeche Mode cannot remained trapped in the darkness and gloominess that has shaped their last nineteen years of life! Honestly, this is the first album Depeche Mode has had real fun with since their first, Speak &amp; Spell in 1980. They are going through the same process as The Cure in the early eighties when they started exploring pop music after their dreadful indulgence in darkness.  What is it you people want!? Do you want Dave Gahan to die? Or do you want him to lose his child? Maybe that would qualify for some good song writting for some people, but not for me. Ultra was better than this album because of my own personal tastes but honestly, Depeche Mode have never done a better job of writting songs that deal with themselves rather than fodder for the charts.  I think, that if this album proves anything, it is that Depeche Mode are so confident in their music-making ability, that they decided to finally have real fun with the songs, a way of poking fun at their departed crisis. This album warrants a five star rating because of the depth of nearly all the lyrics, the inovative bleeps, blips, squeaks, and whirs, &amp; because of the singing of Dave Gahan, which has never sounded better. Shine stands as one of my favorite DM songs, another reason for my fondness towards this album.  Depeche Mode will release more albums, maybe the next one will completely blow us all away. Who knows? But I am a fan above all else, and I will remain faithful to them no matter what.

6303168507|5.0|This movie testifies to the genius of Stephen Speilberg. This movie will make an impression on you after you view it. This movie details the activities of Oscar Shindler and the valuable help that he gave toward saving the lives of Jews during World War II. Many of his tactics held his life on the line. The very inhuman nature of the Nazi concentration camps are displayed by Speilberg in this epic movie. The cruelty of the Nazis is also put on display thanks to the fine movie. This is a deeply moving  film. The Holocaust was brought to the forefront thanks to this movie. The plight of the Jews during the Nazi era has never been better shown. Hats off to Stephen Speilberg for a job well done.
B000002C25|5.0|5 stars, easy...  Their best effort, in an odd way, though incomplete...  Arguably one of the best songs from the Be Here Now sessions was the song &quot;Stay Young&quot;... -on the B-side of the D'ya KNow single; also &quot;The Fever and another one on the STand By Me single, also good... (And yes, parts of their first two albums are great)...  <br />This was the first Oasis CD I ever bought or even heard..  I'd only seen the WOnderwall video and thought it was okay, but not so great...  Then I saw the D'ya Know what I Mean video a few years later... didn't really like it... -but kept hearing or reading about the Be Here Now release on the radio or TV, or in the mags...  So I bought it... and I was not disappointed...  It is really mind music, or at least written that way...  This isn't too much about dance or a dance party on substances...; -this is the day after, mellowing out and then doing it all over again with the parties..  This will be their Exile, White Lp, BoB, Physical Grafiti.. -their great double Lp...  It's great that it's long... -it doens't give one the time to deem whether it's any good or not... really, either you like it or you don't... -that's what double-lps force the listener to commit... <br />Maybe they didn't care about Be Here Now when they were making it.. but it doesn't matter... (that's why people loved Oasis their first two or three years... -because it was obvious that they guys didn't give a damn, and they played like it...  Noel cared about the songs somewhat, though... -and on BeHereNow he lays it all out.. sings a song or two... plays guitar layer upon guitar layer... (And what's with the atmospheric sound overlay effect at the beginning of D'yknow What?...  I mean, it's like the beginning to Astronome DOmine by Flloyd)...  And even though the band doesn't seem to care... well, this may well be their last record where everyone does care...  They finally get their ace-pro drummer they've been wanting, after being unhappy with orig.drummer Tony McCaroll's skills (he got the sack a la Beatle Pete Best, but after fame.. -even worse a fate!)...  I can see why people didn't listen to the whole album the first time, the first time through...  You have to be a sound and music fanatic to really dig it, I think... unless you know what of the poppy songs you want to hear before hand...  <br />I don't know who they were trying to appeal to here, people that like the Beatles, Mod, the Jam, and the E-Manchester scene... like edging toward the Style Council, but too tough to go over the edge like that...  Still, Noel gets away with having/duping? Liam sing some of the sweetest songs, like Stand By Me, Don't Go Away, Girl in the Dirty Shirt (a Kinks like vibe, but genious in that it would be a difficult song in itself to actually dance to...; it's great how the chorus gets extended at the end, great hook)...  The arrangements and background flourishes during Stand By Me are still underrated, and the melody is fine...  And what can be said of It's Getting Better, Man!...  The song rocks!...  And this album has the whole feel of Oasis in the lush vistas of their first taste of worldwide fame... -all snow and Sticky Fingers jetting around the world...  They cling to England and London with their last tax-forms..; -dodging forever after...  THe album cover says it all...; the scooter, parka, shades, phonograph.. -and that's just Liam...  It's mod... and jazz.. and pop.. and English R &amp; B... and Manchester.. and northern... and.. and..  <br />What really stops this CD from feeling complete is the missing of &quot;Stay Young&quot;, &quot;The Fever&quot;, (-though one day these will be included... -maybe in 25 years)...  Stay Young is essential...  And... -unfortunately, due to the change in personnel (the lovable rhythm guitarist Bonehead and bassplayer Guigsy leaving the group after the tour.. -the end of an era).. unfortunately.. Oasis are unlikely to put out a live CD of their Be Here Now tour (the -97 dates in particular are greatness).. -might see something in 30 years, though.. but so much for now...
B00005BJC7|5.0|ALthough very similar in concept to Kid A, I find that this album is a lot more stripped down.  It feels a lot more like a rock band playing than a computer.   But it isn't rock; instead, Radiohead seems to move forward, pushing limits of what they did in Kid A.  Amnesiac is the next logical step forward.  It's got very well constructed songs, but unlike Kid A, they seem developed to a more radio-friendly, single song listenability. (Kid A is satisfying more as a complete album, Amnesiac has more songs that can be played alone).  I recommend it to those who loved Kid A, but to those who didn't, I recommened it as a superior alternative.
B00005B36H|1.0|There is a reason that &quot;Schism&quot; is the first single off the album, it's the only good song. The rest of the album seems to go nowhere. It's like listening to someone in a monotone voice that goes on and on. If I wanted Pink Floyd i'd buy one of their records. Other reviews here mention that if you don't like the album you don't have the capacity to understand the album. Well, a song has to sound good before I care about its meaning. I loved the first two albums, but Tool has let its fans down on this one.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Dude, I was just one of the last people to get the new Radiohead album, and boy am I glad that I got the cd early.  It's got a lot of the elements of Kid A, but they seem somewhat like b-sides--but that's ok, since Kid A was such a masterpiece.  There is somewhat of a return to the old style, but that's only found in a few tracks; don't get your hopes up if you're looking for another The Bends.  It's a great album, but definitely not the best:  Bends, OK Computer, and Kid A are in classes of their own (way more than 5 stars).  This is a kickass album; your basic Radiohead album!

0684833395|5.0|The only way to endure a book about war and the constant hell of bombing runs, to my mind, is if it is desperately funny in a black-humor sort of way. Joseph Heller's masterpiece is exactly that. On an Italian island during WWII, Captain Yossarian and a whole base full of nuts are trying very hard not to get killed, while trying to finish enough of their tour of duty to be sent home, which means they have to go into danger in order to avoid it. Makes no sense? Neither does anything else in this book, except the dangerous, subversive kind of sense that suggests the whole thing -- the war, the military, even authority itself -- make no sense either. I love this book because it takes a serious subject and weaves in non-stop humor; the modern equivalent is the very funny Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf, which will have you belly-laughing as you consider the impacts of genocide. I have the highest respect for these novels -- because they entertain and make me think --  and that's a lot.
B000002H4Q|5.0|If someone told me 15 years ago to listen to a Cure CD, I probably would have laughed in their face. At the time, I was listening to either hard-core metal, classic rock, punk, heavy industrial, or classical. The Cure, to me, was music that all the drama students at my high school listened to. Music for people who were overly sensitive \\"ar-teests\\" (artists) who brooded away too much of their teenage insecurities.<br />Flash forward seven years to 1993. I was taking summer school classes at college and was still listening (primarily) to the heavier brand of music, but my mind was open to other options at this point. One day while walking home from class, I heard \\"Just Like Heaven\\" on the radio and could not get it out of my head. No matter where I went or what I was doing, I found myself singing that song.<br />I finally gave in and bought \\"Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me\\". For the next 4 months, no other CD went into my CD player. I put this CD up there with \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", in that you can't listen to just one song from the CD. You just have to put it in and listen to the whole thing straight through. It's a wonderful work of music. Soon, I turned all of my metal friends onto the CD. Eventually all of us became huge Cure fans, and then got into DM, and then The Smiths, and then New Order, and so on...<br />It was so wild that I missed this music when it first came out. If anyone is looking for a great CD to enter the world of The Cure, I can highly recommend this CD as a place to start. I can't say enough good things about it, and this is coming from someone who was VERY skeptical.<br />If any Cure fans reading this want to enter the metal world, just like I came into yours, try starting with \\"Black Sabbath\\" and \\"Paranoid\\" by Black Sabbath, \\"Killers\\" and \\"Piece of Mind\\" by Iron Maiden, and for the more advanced get \\"Rust In Piece\\" and \\"Cryptic Writings\\" by Megadeth.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Radiohead proves once again why they are the best rock group in the world.  After reinventing themselves last year with the controversial Kid A, the group hinted at a more accessible follow up to the record.  Amnesiac is the result. Kid A was a stunnning and difficult record, but Amnesiac is even better.  It's not a return to a conventional sound like most people are hoping for.  It's as &quot;radical&quot; as Kid A.  Amnesiac is indeed a bit more accessible than Kid A, yet it is also more demanding. It is a much darker and troubling album.  Thom Yorke's world view is becoming increasingly bleak.  The guitar and vocals are more pronounced than they were on Kid A, and a couple of the songs (Knives Out, You and Whose Army and Pyramid Song) sound like they were recorded during the sessions for The Bends or even OK Computer.  But Radiohead continue thier adventurous experimentation.  The bleeps and blips and austere sound of Kid A also informs many of the tracks on Amnesiac.  Like any Radiohead album, its an ALBUM, and should be listened to in its entirety a few times to really digest it all.  It's a brilliant record, I'm really excited by Radiohead's new direction.  Where they turn to next, I can only wait with baited breath.  A++++++
B00003CXP1|5.0|i had this dvd for two weeks before i could bear to put it into the player and watch it.  when i saw the film in the theater, i could barely get out of my seat afterward...i thought it was an amazing piece of filmmaking and the most heart-wrenching work of art i'd ever seen...and i didn't know how i would feel about it watching it on dvd...i was both afraid of being as devastated as i was the first time, and i was also afraid the movie wouldn't have the same power.<br />the effect was different on dvd, but still impressive, and it left me sobbing on the couch when it was over.  this is a grueling, remarkable film.  i'm glad that there's art out there that can touch me in this way.<br />the extras on the dvd were pretty good.  i haven't yet gone through the commentary tracks, but i'm looking forward to them (when i can face the movie again).

1899836357|5.0|The keynote of this book is to show and explain the elements of hypnotic language and how to blend and develop them for healthy psychotherapeutic interventions. For anyone reading this title will become alert to how many forms of persuasion are used to (mis)direct our judgments and even the constructs of a healthy self. The strength of this title is that it provides practical instruction and concrete exercises so that the mystification of need not be that hypnosis works or how it works but that it works so well we resist learning about it.
B00004RHZU|3.0|Here's the track-by-track review:<br />1. \\"Split-Personality\\": I personally like this song.  It's kind of like 'I'm talking to myself again, but somebody's answering me...'<br />2. \\"Hell Wit Ya\\": Bouncy (kinda). 'Female impowerment all the way'.<br />3. \\"Most Girls\\": Opera/symphony meets Pink's personal touch of music.  My kinda song, (if you're not like most girls/guys.)<br />4. \\"There You Go\\": This was a great song to start off Pink's career, and her personal touch, hard R&B/pop.<br />5. \\"You Make Me Sick\\": Another 'Pink's personal touch' song, the video would suggest otherwise.<br />6. \\"Let Me Let You Know\\": A slow melody, Pink specializes in those.  A slow bouncy beat.<br />7. \\"Love is Such a Crazy Thing\\": I'm reminded of a certain Christina Aguilera song, but then it turns into another 'Pink Special'.<br />8. \\"Private Show\\": Interesting beat, interesting lyrics, interesting...period.<br />9. \\"Can't Take Me Home\\": Pink is saying in this song 'If you take me home, your parents will freak out about how weird you and I are together.'<br />10. \\"Stop Falling\\": The best ballad on this CD, it's really beautiful.  Except the 'STOP FALLING!' screaming parts.<br />11. \\"Do What U Do\\": Female impowerment again with a Jay-Z/Nelly feel to it.<br />12. \\"Hiccup\\": A waste of CD time, I do not get it at all.<br />13. \\"Is It Love\\": Mid-tempo-ish and interesting beat.<br />Overall review: 3 stars: I was gonna give it a 2, but that was too harsh.  Though Pink does a good job on some songs, she just shrugs off some songs and they turn out bad.  A good attempt at the freshman CD, but a little more work could of gone into it.
0800177177|3.0|Bram Stoker's Dracula certainly deserved a better DVD. Image and audio quality are very good, but don't expect nothing beyond this. Not even a trailer. Well, there's a side A/B option for fullscreen/widescreen. That's all. The movie is fantastic. Coppola is great at telling love stories - remember One From The Heart? Interestingly, he also associated some vampires acts with a high level of eroticism, just like it's supposed to be in this case, producing unforgettable sequences.  Also, the movie is about love, not about frightening viewers. But the best, in my opinion, is Dracula's shadow, which is the free expression of his feelings, almost always acting by itself. It's amazing how Coppola manages to create a masterpiece without the best casting, and also without being intrusive. But that's the trademark of good directors - to produce the best no matter how. Great movie - 4 stars. Poor DVD - 2 stars.
B00005B36H|5.0|TOOL is not for everyone, and any music lover who pics up any of their albums has to be willing to really listen to them to apreciate the beauty that they are giving us......LATERALUS is the same TOOL we know and love and much more. The production of this album is much better than any of there past efforts and  forget about songs, listen to the whole thing!!!!!!!!. FOR THE PEOPLE WHO GAVE BAD REVIEWS TO THIS ALBUM: FREE YOUR MIND, THIS ALBUM IS A RELIGIOUS EXPIRIENCE (the lirics are not SATANIC, please listen before judging!!!!!), but not the first, second or third time around.......If you dont appreciate it then your not worthy of his album and should give it away to someone who would enjoy it.........<br />TO THE TOOL LOVERS, listen to the way this guys make the best of a melody, they drain everything from it. They are continiung the work of GENESIS, KING CRIMSON, YES, GENTLE GIANT, PINK FLOYD, METALLICA without sounding old. I would go as far as to say that they continue the work of Beethoven!!!!!
B00005B4GU|5.0|there is alot of hype surrounding bands today, but radiohead is the only band deserving of it, as erach album passses this band seems to grow. And of all the critisms KID A has, one thing you cant deny, is the ablity to move forward and try differnt things. Radiohead could easliy make OK COMPUTER II, but would PET SOUNDS II be fun? no it wouldnt, why repeart yourself, try things, as you go along the path, the sounds that seem to fit will show up more and more as albums progress, and theres where AMNESIAC has it charm, it seems somewhat of a mix of KID A and the ease of listening (to an extant) of OK COMPUTER. PACKED LIKE.. sounds like steel drums going crazy as eletric paino tries to overcome, one of the best, and most interesting songs radiohead has ever written PYRAMID SONG takes you on a dream ride of jumping in rivers, and finding where there is to see.. To go through each song is rediculas, because radiohead albums are ment to be listened to as a whole. But the closer LIFE IN A GLASS HOUSE shows why radiohead is one of the best music groups around, combining new orleans Jazz and experimental horns, but it all seems to fit so perfectly like a puzzle with 1000 peices that seems extreamly big, but at the end it all fits, and With this album, I'll &quot;stay and chew the fat&quot;
B000009EAD|5.0|In fact, I had first heard of Iced Earth through a Metallica website so I decided to get this album since it has an instrumental &quot;1776&quot;.  To call this album the saviour of metal is not giving it full credit.  This album, honest to goodness, impacted me as much as Metallica's Master Of Puppets did!  Burning Times opens up this album with an absolutely fierce guitar tone, then it leads off into the atmospheric Melancholy (Holy Martyr) which is my favorite song on this album.  If I had to compare this album to anything it would have to be something like James Hetfield singing for Iron Maiden.  Matt Barlow is the most intense and emotional singer that I've heard since Sebastian Bach.  The Something Wicked trilogy is an absolute ride through Hell when listened to all the way through as a full song!  It takes a lot to really leave me breathless musically and Iced Earth have accomplished that task, a task in which only Black Sabbath and Metallica have accomplished in the past.  Great Job!

B000056K04|5.0|Although this album did not spark a change in the traditional Dave Matthews Band (DMB) music, as their previous album Before These Crowded Streets did, it still represents DMB music at its best.  With amazing tracks like &quot;So Right&quot;, &quot;Everyday&quot;, and &quot;The Space Between&quot;, it truly presents the listener with a great sample of the bands talents. I just hope that it doesn't get too much airplay, like &quot;I Did It&quot;, their first single off the album, got.

B000002UJQ|5.0|If ever there were an album that completely nailed every aspect of depression, angst, loneliness, paranoia, anger, and other assorted feelings of sorrow, this album would be it.  Radiohead, now most known for its daring lack of concern for popular trends in music, had been known mostly for their runaway hit &quot;Creep.&quot; Then, the album The Bends came out, a beautiful album that showed the first spark of creativity that would fuel the band later down the road. With The Bends, Radiohead gained its legions of devoted fans and critical praise. Then came this album. OK Computer blew the standards for rock clean away. With its conceptual theme; a world deteriorating with material possession and technology, the album was daring in its storyline, but also daring in its musical structure. The album is epic. It's epic in lenth, scope, and vision. The song &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; wails on for close to seven minutes, also containing some of the album's best lines. &quot;Ambition makes you look very ugly, kicking, squealing, gucci little piggy.&quot;  &quot;God loves his children, God loves his children, yeah!&quot; The album's lyrics are insane and chaotic, as if they were penned by a madman at his last shred of mental control. The music is bizarre, beautiful, complex, and layered. You never get bored listening to the constant prism of sound that is OK Computer. Jonny Greenwood's guitar, Collin's bass,  Ed's rythm guitar, Phil's drumming, and of course Thom's singing makes for one of the most soothing, yet disturbing albums I've ever heard. This is bound to be classic. For all of its intense lyricism, complex music, and wonderful vision, OK Computer is one of the very best rock albums of all time, and will no doubt go down in history as one of the defining moments in rock history. OK Computer proved to the music industry what their fans already knew; that Radiohead is one of the most brilliant bands to ever grace the face of music.

The story is captivating; it revolves around the friendship of two unlikely WWII veterans raising families in 1970s London: Iqbal, a devout Muslim with a young shrewish wife and twin boys that are trouble, and Archie, a doddering, meek white man with a beautiful, young jamacian wife and daughter, Irie. Their lives and families intertwine, and no matter what character she's focusing on, Smith writes with truth, honesty and heartfelt emotion.  Don't miss this book.

I was not disappointed!  I have never seen a man who could say so much with his eyes.  We come to know Mr. Darcy very well, as we see him in many situations, more so than in the book!  But it works for me.  Jennifer Ehle did a good job, but Colin Firth stole the show!  Jane, a reported beauty, was not a beauty in this version. All in all, very entertaining.  I watched it through the first time!
0792842073|5.0|I regretted having delayed to see this movie. It is the story of Sr Helen Prejean who meets a man who has been on Death Row for six years and had only less than a week to live. The movie depicts her compassionate journey with him to the end. The powerfully simple script without any dramatic twists and the compelling characters brillaintly acted out by Oscar winner Susan Sarandon along with Sean Penn, make this a memorable movie of all time.  The penetrating message about the capital punishment continues to be relevant to our society.
6305426694|3.0|John Travolta is Jan Schlichtman, who heads a small but hugely profitable New England law firm powered by a small circle of legal sharks. His team includes Tony Shalhoub and Bill Macy and an endless reservoir of legal agression. Their can-do attitude has rewarded the firm's partners handsomely, and Travolta's charachter expands his tastes fit what they can buy. (He can afford both a Porsche and a seemingly endless stream of speeding tickets). Unknowingly at first, the firm takes as a client the emotionally bereft inhabitants of a rural town suffering a cluster of cancers and leukemia. After a single visit, Jan Schlictman discovers a possible link between the disease, possibly contaminated water and a nearby tannery that provides products for \\"Beatrice\\" a multinational consortium that makes....everything. Plunging into the case with the idea of securing a monster settlement from the huge consportium, Schlichtman confronts an overpowering sadness unlike anything he's ever encountered, and one he allows to get the better of him. Soon, hoped-for settlement proposals are turned down, ideals substitute for dollar signs, and the firm racks up horrific bills in its bid to link the Beatrice tannery to the rash of lukemia and death surrounding a small town - there must be a fight.<br />Unfortunately - that's where it bogs down, the fight never comes. Instead, we get to see Travolta become unhinged as his sage (but not quite saintly)legal nemesis (Robert Duval) frames a comment on legal dedication, with Schlichtman as the obvious example. Schlicthman's life had by then devolved into a process for making money and finding things to spend it on. With the profit motive gone, his mind follows. In amove that Schlichtman rails against (but which we never explore fully enough for it to register) the Judge allows the jury to sever Beatrice from the trail, and Schlichtman's duel with Duvall's charachter never reaches the Hollywood stage of \\"You Can't Handle The Truth!\\"  In the end, Schlictman's fortunes are destroyed, his career and his firm in ruins, and the hard-bargained-for settlement only leaves his clients embittered.  No amount of settlement can remotely substitute for what the town's residents have lost, and nothing can mitigate the failure that Schlictman's efforts have produced.  In a voice-over, played out as documents and transcripts from the trial are dusted off and trucked out into the light of day (down the beltway where we're supposed to think that they'll be reviewed anew) Schlichtman both confesses failure yet exhorts us to follow his example.  Failure, he seems to say, is hardly a reason to shy from the epic effort of battling evil in its many banal forms.  Still, while the tragic ends of the film swerve away from Hollywood's \\"the little guy wins\\" mentality, it doesn't really leave anything in its wake.  By the end of the film, Schlichtman has matured beyond measuring himself by his material profits, but nothing quite fills the gap left by the legal shark who got things rolling at the film's opening.
B00004WG2X|5.0|I enjoyed both the A&amp;E and this the BBC version.  I feel they both had their strong points and weak points.  Elizabeth Garvie as Lizzie in this version could not be bested in my opinion.  She was excellent.  Although, I did not see anything really wrong with Jennifer Ehle's portrayal I liked Elizabeth's better.  There was some license taken with the dialogue and specific scenes and this certainly effects understanding the relationship between Lizzy &amp; Mr. Darcy.  His  admiration of Lizzy is more apparent in the A&amp;E version, the scene where she is playing the piano at Pemberley.  This scene is not the same in the BBC version.  Darcy's gaze upon Lizzy says it all, is very revealing, and why Colin Firth's Darcy was just a little more human.  David Rintoul was good, but I could not see open admiration in his face as you could Colin Firth.  I thought Jane was too plain in the A&amp;E version.  She did not strike me as a beauty!  And poor Mary was too plain. All in all they were both well done and entertaining.  This one is very close to the book!
B00005B4GU|5.0|Maybe nothing can live up those words, but Radiohead shows an ability to combine the avant garde with traditional alternative in this great outing.  The feel of Kid A is combined with a sound familiar to The Bends gives the album an electryfing pulse while pushing our hearing to new limits.  Radiohead has once again succeded in pushing the envelope.  This album is a feast for fans, but still manages newcombers to listen a second time.  Definitely the best album thus far this year.
B000000XB9|5.0|The great majority of Creedence Clearwater Revival hits are included on this disc.  There is a reason these guys were popular and have lasted: originality.  Their singles always had a whole different feel to them.  My favorites on the CD are I Put A Spell On You, Heard It Through The Grapevine and Lookin' Out My Back Door.  Probably the biggest hits on this album were Proud Mary and Bad Moon Rising, which are both very good.  The only two I don't like are Fortunate Son and Sweet Hitch Hiker.  Still, this is a great piece of American musical history that should definately be purchased.  I really enjoyed it, and I wasn't even alive when these guys were popular!  :)
B000002H2H|5.0|This is Metallica's best album ever made.  Every song is memorable and this is the definitive sound of thrash.  There are no good songs on here, there are only FANTASTIC songs, and every one is great.  The classics &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;, &quot;Fade to Black&quot; (the best Metallica song ever), and &quot;Creeping Death&quot; are on here, and the epic &quot;Call of Ktulu&quot; is here too.  My only gripe is that there are only 8 songs on here, but this album was made in 1984, and this was pretty much standard then, but still, you can't deny the sheer power of Metallica, and you can't deny how great this album is.  If you don't have this, stop reading this and buy it!
B00004BZ0N|5.0|I do not even need to say anything about &quot;London Calling&quot; that has not already been said. This is the most incredible record/c.d. I ever came across or have ever come across since.
B000002JNJ|4.0|This is where Pantera got rid of their glam sound (mostly), and opted for fast paced balls of the wall thrash.  The title track, Primal Concrete Sledge, Psycho Holiday, Cemetery Gates, Domination, abd Art of Shredding are the best songs on here, but every song is great.  Listen to this then listen to Pantera's &quot;Reinventing the Steel&quot; to hear how far Pantera has come over the years.
B000001DYY|5.0|If I could only have one TFF c.d in my collection it would be this one. Not as simplistic as \\"Songs from the Big Chair\\" yet no as overproduced as \\"Sowing The Seeds\\" it is a joy to listen to from start to finish (o.k., with maybe the expection of \\"Gas Giants\\"). Her is the breakdown:<br />Elemental- Brooding synthesized rock number 9 out of 10<br />Cold- Pop with a rock edge-think harder edged songs of Crowded House or Squeeze- 10 out of 10<br />Break It Down Again- Lightweight pop- popular single- 8 out of 10.<br />Mr. Pessimist- Brooding atmospheric creative song 8 out of 10<br />Dog's a Best Friend's Dog- Flat out rocker with fantastic guitar work and alternating snarling and soaring vocals 10 of 10.<br />Fish Out Of Water- Mid Tempo rock number, powerful attack on former Tear Curt Smith   9 out of 10<br />Gas Giant- Slow, lethargic, unintersting instrumental 2 out of 10<br />Power- Title says it all  10 out of 10<br />Brian Wilson Said- segues from Beach Boys to Cocktail Jazz 7 out of 10<br />Goodnight Song- another porpular cut played on radio a lot 6 out of 10
B000009EAD|5.0|This CD is awesome. The music is awesome, the lyrics are awesome. What's not to like?<br />My favorite track is # 5, Stand Alone. I use it's lyrics in my sig picture on one of the message boards I go to. Track 6 is my second favorite on this album.
B000001FZK|1.0|It was all I could do from slipping into a coma listening to this one. Understated and ambient are one thing but ZZZZZZZZZ, oops, sorry, I was listening to the c.d. while writing this review.
B000056NX4|4.0|Unlike Ted &quot;screamin' Jesus&quot; Neeley, Glenn Carter's clear vocals and peaceful, not peevish presence makes you see a character that someone can care for.  Gethsemane, is heartbreaking, angry, tired, and resentful.  The acceptance of fate at the end is defiant and poignant.<br />Jerome Pradon's Judas is dark and questioning, a figure that demands attention and a role in the direction they are heading and is denied it to the point of betrayal of someone ha clearly loves to save what he can.  His vocals are heartrending...his mannerisms edgy and animated.<br />Fred Johannson's Pilate is confused.  A pawn worse the Judas.  Tormented by prophetic dreams and longing to help but unable to stop the flow of events.  His vocals are somewhere between imperious and frightened...moving.  And criticisms of Rik Mayall's Herod are unfounded.  Herod's number has been the plays only spot of levity in this play since it's inception.  THAT is difficult to handle w/the subject matter. But Mayall makes Herod both comic and menacing.  Like a poisonous snake poised to strike.  A dodged swing of his cane..and well timed sarcastic &amp; angry emphasis of words Mayall is great.  Renee Castle is beautiful and affecting...the whole cast is SUPERB.<br />Special Kudos to Michael Shaeffer's Annas...A frightening presence in any scene he stands in and when he sings he can make you shiver.  Great Costumes...especially the Pharisees.<br />The only disappointment is the choreography in the JCS/crucifixiton scene...a lot more could have been done there.
B000002UWE|4.0|Talk Talk started out as one of the millions of trendy, new-wave, neo-romantic bands of the time. What they became was so much more but unfortunately only one of thier efforts (The incredible &quot;Colour of Spring&quot;) was a bonafide classic. It was on that they attained the perfect blend between thier old sound and what was to become thier sound of the future. The best songs on this collection are &quot;Living in Another World, Life's What You Make It, Give It Up, Hapiness is Easy and Such A Shame&quot;. Thankfully &quot;Colour&quot; is represented by four tracks here (It is out of print I beleive, may be available on import). Too bad they took thier sound so far into an ambient mode that by the time of &quot;Laughing Stock&quot; you could barely find a pulse.
B000053ZRR|3.0|The DVD supports Dolby Digital 5.1, but for some reason the quality isn't that good.   After listening to Britney Spears Live DVD, the difference in quality really shows.  The sound just doesn't stand out, somewhat flat/muffled sounding.   <br />It's a good concert though, great music--- just a shame the sound quality isn't the best (I'd barely call it good!).
B00005B4GU|2.0|Legions of rabid Radiohead fans will disagree, but as someone who loved everything from Pablo Honey to Ok Computer, was entertained by Meeting People is Easy, and own a copy of Kid A that I listen to occasionally, I have to say I can't really relate to the direction they've taken themselves recently...despite the hype Amnesiac doesn't seem like much of a &quot;return&quot; to anything pre-Kid-A-ish...still present are the odd nonsensical song lyrics that Kid A introduced (peppered with the occasional moments where something they're saying actually makes sense), the mundane and, I'd say, deliberately uncatchy melodies, no songs here that really get stuck in the head, no unifying theme/ overriding feeling like OK Computer had, blah blah...and no, I don't want a return or reproduction of that album, but still, everyone makes a big deal about this being so different, refreshing, unique, whatnot, it just doesn't seem like those are necesarily good qualities in this case, especially when compared to what we've all seen them to be capable of...
0446310786|5.0|To Kil a Mockingbird is the heart felt classic of three children growing up in Alabama during a time when all men were not created equal. It is the story of the experiences of a young woman while wathing her father courageously defend a man accused of rape, but more importantly by a middle age white man. This is an American classic-a novel that takes its readers deep down into what society was like during Scout Finch's time. To Kill A Mockingbird is an absolute must for all book-lovers!
B00005B4GU|4.0|Ok, so I just bought the special edition for this CD at over 20 bucks. Was it worth it? For me; yes. If you are debating on whether or not to buy it, this is the advice I have to offer: if you gave up on Radiohead after &quot;Ok Computer&quot;, than it's not for you.  As expected this album is very much a &quot;Kid B&quot; yet I don't think the album is as strong as &quot;Kid A&quot;. While there are a lot of good mediocre tracks, it is lacking the big staples like &quot;National Anthem&quot;, &quot;Optimistic&quot; and &quot;Idioteque&quot; that &quot;Kid A&quot; had to offer. The content is definately there...you just need the patience to appreciate it. Newbies to Radiohead following the trends need not apply.
0671042858|5.0|I just finished the book The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon and was so moved by this exquisite work that I felt compelled to write a review. In my opinion this story reflects the diversity and range of storytelling King is capable of. Instead of sticking to his &quot;creepy-blood-and-gore&quot; niche, the author has stepped out and written one of the most believable adventure stories I've read in a long time, while still managing to horrify the reader. I literally couldn't put this book down.<br />Some very good books often make you feel you are there with the character throughout the story. This one makes you feel like you ARE the character. Kudos once again to Steve for giving us the details (noseeums, slimey mud, fiddleheads) that other authors would forego.
0767821629|5.0|There is more than just a connection between a quote of dialogue between these two films.  Someone out there is saying something...profound...but cleverly hidden.<br />But if they say it long enough, and cleverly enough, and with enough intrigue and head/brain scratching provocation, people may begin to catch on.<br />The frame plot seems to be about a virtual reality program (hello, &quot;eXistenZ&quot;!) ...which allows individuals from one level of reality (the one which we as viewers assume is our own level of reality) to download into the virtual reality of 1930's Los Angeles.  Now why anyone would want to go to 1930s Los Angeles is another question...but the visuals here are stunning...and you DO want to go there...and back again...the whole 1930s atmosphere of hotel showroom, swoony female singer, backup band, bartenders with sexy smiles and insidious intents...leads the viewer down the concrete (rather than yellow-brick) road to face the ultimate REALITY...and <br />shocking answer...there is murder and mayhem... and too much foul-language (which really gets in the way) ... and just when you think you have finally got a handle on what it is all about...they take your head off by taking you up another level!   There may be another link here, too, with &quot;The Game&quot; -- the same actor who plays the older gentleman with a fondness for 1930s hotel women plays an elderly book publisher who is being fired from his job in &quot;The Game&quot; (if &quot;The Game&quot; isn't life -- or  &quot;existenz&quot; as we know it--or the reality we think we are a part of and living in, then what is it?).<br />  The REAL question is -- which film has the best presentation of this hidden puzzle -- &quot;Dark City,&quot;  &quot;The Thirteenth Floor,&quot; or &quot;eXistenZ&quot;?  My personal preference is in the order presented in this question.  BUY IT!  WATCH IT!   FIGURE IT OUT!!  Your life may depend on it!!
B0000025CP|5.0|If you have any interest in the heavy metal genre, this outstanding album simply must be in your collection.  Judas Priest really poured their hearts and souls into making every part of this masterpiece just perfect.  Bone cruynching guitar riffery, incrdibl drumming wizardry, an excellent producton sound, and a tour-de-force vocal performance from the greatest front man heavy metal has ever seen, Rob Halford.  This album iks one of metal's defining moments.  Priest influenced so many people with this release, unleashing the New Wav Of British Heavy Metal.  And the thing that makes this album so remarkable is that music of this intensity was not beng made around the late seventies.  Staineed Class is the producto f origional thought that helped create what is heavy metal.  Every song i perfectly crafted.  Just pure brilliance from one of the most remarkable musical frces of all time--Judas Priest!
B00005B4GU|4.0|What does a band do after having a number one album while having absolutely no videos or clear cut &quot;radio-friendly&quot; singles? Radiohead the &quot;saviours of rock&quot; were supposed to get back to the guitar driven punch that made &quot;Ok Computer&quot; the critics darling. Instead, what we get is &quot;Amnesiac&quot; the fifth album from the Oxford enigma. This album was recorded during the same time as last year's &quot;Kid A&quot; and well there are similarities. It is not as if this is a collection of B-sides or tracks not up to par for &quot;Kid A&quot; but rather &quot;Amnesiac&quot; is the bastard step-child of it's predecessor. Radiohead are purposely creating a different world on &quot;Amnesiac&quot; which may or may not be accepted but really that is the point. The beginning track &quot;Packt like sardines in a crushd tin box&quot; hammers it's way to the hidden soundscapes that lay ahead however it is journey the listener will not remember. One might here the current single &quot;I might be wrong&quot; or the greasy New Orleans jazz number &quot;Life in a Glass-house&quot; but one thing is sure the trek ahead is troubling.
0788821075|1.0|Don't get me wrong, I love Julia Roberts. But i was sickened by the message of this film.  (1) Prostitution is just another job -- look, someone as perfect as Julia's character does it. Come ON, arent we past romanticizing a profession that degrades both purchaser and seller? (2) Even more nauseating:  Happiness is a credit card.  The worst scene in the movie -- which i vividly remember 10 years later -- is that the great gift that Gere gives to Roberts is not love or self-respect -- it's the ability to wave his credit card in the faces of the snooty salespeople who looked down on her.  THIS is what gives her self-respect -- the ability to spend someone else's money.  I find this grossly offensive.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Yes. This ablbum is another great one from Radiohead. All the songs are kickin. My favorite song is &quot;You and whose army&quot;<br />Overall a great album. A must have for every one!
B00000JGEO|1.0|this movie.  It is one of the very worst &quot;respectable&quot; movies i have ever seen.  The fact that nothing in it was funny would not bother me so much.  What bothers me is the way that Arnold treats his wife:  He locks her in that room and frightens her into telling him things that are very private, for his amusement.  I consider this to be sadism, and it made me so uncomfortable that i wanted to walk out. It even made my husband uncomfortable.
B00005BJC7|5.0|sitting in dark room listening to Kid A was an experience.  The lack of typical giutar sounds and the adding of plush electronics augmented Radioheads already melodic nature.  Amnesiac is the album I expected to hear after OK Computer, which makes the release of Kid A more interesting.  Amnesiac pushes dreams into the musical realm, lush soundscapes and perfect vocals (once again).  Still maintaining the experimental and electronic elements of Kid A, Amnesiac is more an experiment with melody and mood than any of their previous works.  the tracks flow flawlessly, ebbing and flowing with energy and power, as well as odd time signatures and haunting crescendos.  There are really too many highlights to discuss any particular track; it's one of those albums that requires an aural judgement.  Pure and beautiful
0679745203|3.0|The movie, very romantic, so.. I needed even more than before to visit Toscana (in the end, also a disappointment compared with Piemonte, Veneto, ...). Unfortunately, novels and films not only need not tell the truth but are free to distort it badly. The real story of Almasy can be read on the web, in English or German. He was a German agent, was never captured, had no great interest in women and died on the way home sometime after the war of a disease contracted earlier in Africa. He indeed was an Africa researcher and did write a book, Schwimmer in die W&uuml;ste, about the pictures on the rocks in the desert. Almasy means apple, more or less, his family made money from apple orchards in Hungary and bought the castle, never quite attaining official status as nobility from the Austrian government. So, the film is largely a charming, romantic fabrication, as are most films.<br />Somehow, it is very unsatisfying to be seduced by a book or film and later discover that harldly anything in it is correct. The fortress where Laszlo Almasy grew up, Burg Bernstein, lies south of Vienna and is now an attractive little Schloss-Hotel run by my wife's only aunt's best friend, a K&uuml;ffstein-German who was adopted by the Africa researcher's brother after WWII. The castle does have a fantastic kitchen and a wonderful high view of the surrounding territory, maybe the best view in the region. Also, there are nice wine 'villages' not far away.
B000003BE4|4.0|For &quot;Satisfaction&quot; alone this is an important album.  What brings it to an upper echelon is the hauntingly menacing &quot;Play With Fire.&quot;  The other ten tracks pale in comparison to these two.  While &quot;Satisfaction&quot; is a track with few surprises left for most listeners (although after several close listens I was surprised at just how intelligent the lyrics were, as opposed to the expected anthem about sex), &quot;Play With Fire&quot; will be a new experience for many listeners.  The other very pleasant surprise is the Sam Cooke cover &quot;Good Times.&quot;  This track gives Mick a chance to sing a bit more soulful than is his wont, and he pulls it off famously.  Some of the tracks (&quot;Mercy Mercy&quot; and &quot;Hitch Hike&quot;) are enjoyable but obvious filler.  By and large, however, this very early Stones album shows them on the cusp of becoming the tour de force of the later 60s and 70s.
B00005BJC7|5.0|Radiohead has been called one of the most magnetic and magnificent bands of our generation.  Two of their albums come into the top five greatest of all time, right under the Beatles.  Plus, lead singer Thom Yorke is always big about reinventing the band, never giving into mainstream.<br />Yet some how, Radiohead seems to come up in the mainstream, especially after the release of 1997's OK Computer.  In October of 2000, the band released Kid A, a blend of electronic, brit pop, and rock, people were afraid.  It was different and people weren't used to hearing these new sounds on the radio, which is why Radiohead didnt release any real music videos.<br />Amnesiac was originally going to be made into a double album with Kid A, but guitarist/vocalist Ed O'Brien said it would be too much, so with Kid A, they recorded what would become Amnesiac, the band's fifth LP.<br />Pyramid Song was released as their fist single, a duet between Thom and Phil Selway, drums.  However, that is only one of the many shining beacons on Amnesiac.  Many people use an comparison of Kid A and Amnesiac like you called someones house and kept getting the answering machine.  They were there, but you couldnt talk to them.  But now, with Amnesiac, its like you finally got the person on the phone.  You see many of the same ideas on Amnesiac as you did on Kid A.<br />I think it would be my ultimate nightmare to have Radiohead become mainstream, but with this album, i think they could finally get the recognition they deserve.  When i got this album a couple weeks ago off an auction site, i fell in love with it.  Its nothing like Kid A, even though we see the same themes, its utterly different.  Guitars and basses are back in place for this recording.  While all of these songs have been previously written and recorded, they have never been released, until now.  It was surprising to me that all this stuff is old, yet so fresh.<br />Songs like &quot;You and Whose Army?&quot; will be up a lot on MTV.  Notthat this is a good thing, but for MTV to play such a non-mainstream artist says something.  Already &quot;Pryamid Song&quot; is in regular rotation! (YAY!) If you have a chance to find the lyrics for this album, theyre quite remarkable as well, but old Thom does have an English degree.<br />Other songs like &quot;Morning Bell/Amnesiac&quot; are not only featured on Kid A, but very similar, since this was a remix.  Somehow, its still fresh because it doesnt use electronics this time.  While this album has been edited and cut on a computer (Thom says that someday, all music will be made on a laptop) it has a feeling of connection and unison.<br />I really loved what Radiohead did with this album, and i think that it will finally bring them some mainstream recognition, which may not be what Thom and the band wants, but it is what they deserve.<br />Amnesiac is wonderful, and the Limited Edition has great artwork by the remarkable artist, Stanley Donwood, who did the fold-outs for Kid A and OK Computer (and perhaps the other albums as well, but his name is not directly associated).<br />Try to catch them on tour this summer, too.
0452282152|4.0|This book relates the adventures of a young girl forced into becoming a maid by a family misfortune. The struggles of someone without status or power to navigate her way through her new masters (with their contrary demands), mischevious children, and powerful community members makes for a very good plot. <br />I would highly recommend this book to all readers. No special interest in history or art is required.<br />Side note: This story is so well done that I think the only possible criticism might be related to its very perfection. Griet-our young maiden and main character-seems to be just a bit too perfect; both in her responses to each situation, as well as perhaps also her keen powers of observation. (Critics of Fitzgerald's &quot;Great Gatsby&quot; have said something similar, e.g., that Jordan Baker's knowledge of the details of Daisy's past are difficult to credit.)
B00000J7RZ|5.0|Jennifer Lopez hit the music scene with a hit single and a smash debut album that shot her straight to the top for weeks after its release. The single: &quot;If You Had My Love,&quot; which was an instant hit. And why not? The song has got a very catchy beat to back up the not-so-new-but-ever-so-stylized lyrics and rhythms. The album: &quot;On the 6,&quot; containing such invigorating songs as &quot;Waiting for Tonight,&quot; and the somber &quot;Should've Never.&quot; Whether it's fast and furious or slow and mellow, Lopez hits all the right spots with her flare for music. Certainly a hit in a year of ever-increasingly redundant beats and songs.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Radiohead is the most examined, dissected and scrutinized band playing today and has been one of the most emulated by other bands over the last decade. Before the arrival of this, the band's fifth studio album, Radiohead's sound has evolved from mainstream guitar rock (\\"Pablo Honey,\\" 1993), to sweeping art-house rock (\\"The Bends,\\" 1995), to widely (WIDELY) revered sonic melancholy (\\"OK Computer,\\" 1997), to ambient, post-pop, post-rock, post-everything concepualism (\\"Kid A,\\" 2000).    Where next? With \\"Amnesiac,\\" Radiohead continues along the road it started down with \\"Kid A,\\" but longtime producer Nigel Godrich and the band achieve a more exposed (and at times freakier) turn than anything they've done before. There is a certain claustrophobia on several tracks (\\"You and Whose Army?,\\" \\"Like Spinning Plates\\") that recalls \\"OK Computer,\\" but, for the most part, the sonic landscape is barren and wide open.    You like this CD the way you like a highly stylized independent film: on its own terms. It's not particularly melodic. There are no hooks and only a smattering of verse-chorus tunes. The album is probably not as apt to influence other bands as previous albums have. But \\"Amnesiac\\" turns up wide patches of new ground, and Radiohead deserves high praise for pulling that feat off yet again.
B00004RFFI|3.0|&quot;Twister&quot; is a success in many different ways, mainly due to the incredible use of special effects that went into its making. A movie about lots of big storms and at least five different tornadoes calls for some of the most sophisticated digital effects on the market, and on that basis, the movie delivers. The action is quite intense, and certain scenes call on some old-school clichés that we'll all recall from past disaster films. In fact, the only place in which the movie fails is its story, despite a very talented cast. <br />I would say that it started a revolution in the movies of today: nowadays, moviemakers seem to think that the bigger the effects, the better the movie, regardless of characterization or story. This is definitely the case with such movies as &quot;Volcano&quot; and &quot;Armageddon,&quot; and there are movies that seem to get the formula for effects and story evened out, but rarely. In this case, &quot;Twister&quot; is more about the special effects show than about anything else. <br />Beginning appropriately enough with (duh!) a tornado, young Joe (played in adulthood by Helen Hunt) is traumatized by the death of her father, who was sucked up in the twister while trying to hold the storm cellar door in place as the tornado comes wailing overhead. This is one of the movie's unexplained events: he is holding the door in place so that his wife and daughter would not be sucked out of the cellar, so when he disappears, why are they still standing there? Also unexplained is the absence of her mother for the rest of the movie: did she die? Was she abducted by aliens? Guess we'll never know.<br />Moving on in years, the present day finds Joe and a crew of storm chasers doing what they love: spotting twisters. It is here that the baggage piles on heavily: her ex-husband, Bill (played by Bill Paxton), wants her to sign divorce papers so he can marry his new girlfriend, who, annoying enough, tags along for most of the movie's ride. Because he wants her to sign the papers, he follows along with her to chase the storms, hoping that the system he devised will be a success. <br />That system is a way of plotting how tornadoes form in hopes that warning time may be increased for areas in harm's way. Of course, these machines must be placed in the storm's path just a few seconds before it reaches that specific spot, making for some incredibly tense situations. And, as if the tornadoes were not a formidable enemy, the movie introduces a rival group of storm chasers with sophisticated equipment and the same system Bill developed. <br />Before I get to the bad parts, I must say that the special effects and action in &quot;Twister&quot; are in all the right places. Director Jan de Bont gets everything right in these areas: our characters find themselves in one tight situation after another. Some are unbelievable, yes (I was a bit unconvinced when the twisters come right up on the hood of the red truck), but in the grand scheme of things, this isn't the kind of movie to take too seriously when it comes to the danger. <br />And the effects will blow you away. This is probably one of the best recreations of inclimate weather ever put forth for the big screen. The twisters themselves are fascinating: for those of us who have always been intrigued by them, this is probably the next best thing to actually seeing one up close (and, I'm sure, a lot safer). Waiting for the first real view of a tornado is one of the best things about this movie, too. <br />But the story is a flop, its only purpose being to supply the motive for the effects and action, while never actually taking on any cling or meaning. Actors Paxton and Hunt, as well as some brilliant supporting actors, are given characters that do little other than put themselves in danger again and again. Basically, the story is there to give the effects a purpose for being the movie, and then it really has nothing else to do and nowhere to go. <br />Overall, it's lacking. This is the kind of movie where the story is overrun by an overabundance of special effects, and while they are terrific, they cannot save the movie completely. I expected more out of the story, and while I was completely enamored with the special effects and technological excellence that was so lovingly extracted for the film, I would've like to have seen better characters for such talented actors.
B00005BJC7|4.0|No poor English, the title of this review is meant to sit as it is.It seems Radiohead have decided to become the modern day Pink Floyd and by doing so have alienated alot of their core fans but i'm not so sure the band cares. Their 5th release begins in a manner that would fit more along the lines of a Chemical Brothers cd. The music on this album is more organic than 'Kid A' but it is still too early to say whether it is better or worse. These songs were all recorded at the same time of 'Kid A' so before listening, you must understand that Radiohead is not going backwards to their guitar driven pop. Forget all the pre-release rumors of 'like kid a but more guitar' or 'kid a' meets ok computer'. It is neither of these but yet it fits smoothly along their last release...so smooth that you wonder why they even waited to release this as a separate entity. I think the two work better as a whole. Maybe that is the purpose, maybe we as listeners are supposed to figure out some sort of mystery here...like playing alternate songs from each cd back to back. Then again, maybe I'm way too analytical and thinking too hard about something that isn't more complex than just good music.
B00003CX5A|5.0|\\"Sleepy Hollow\\" was a film that came along at Exactly the Right Time. Everywhere us Cinemagoers looked, we saw another Teen Slasher flick Now Playing or Coming Soon. Then Tim Burton brings out This, a Horror film that was Fresh, Original, Brilliantly Brought to the Screen and, most importantly... Scary.<br />Johnny Depp Reinvents himself once again as Ichabod Crane, A Big City Constable who is sent to \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" to solve a Strange Murder, using his Peculiar Scientific Techniques. Said Murder quickly deteriorates into Many, Many Murders and Ichabod starts to give in to the Townspeople's claims that these murders are being Executed not by a Mere Mortal, but by something else entirely. Director Tim Burton and Star Depp have made Ichabod a Truly Original Hero, he has the Will of a Stallion and the Stomach of a 10-year-old girl. He Believes in Reason, but is Surrounded by Superstition. He is a Unique and Treasured Character, the kind who doesn't come along very often. (like \\"The Dude\\" played by Jeff Bridges in \\"The Big Lebowski\\")<br />Burton also creates a World of his own, A Nightmarish-Dreamland filled with Magic and Mystery, Darkness and Death. He Stocks the film with Oddball characters that fit the film like a glove, and Oddball actors who fit their roles Perfectly. Burton Regular Jeffrey Jones gives another Eye-catching performance, as he always does, and Christina Ricci (this girl was Born to act in Tim Burton films) gives a Mature and Beautiful performance as Katrina, Depp's Love interest and a girl more Involved in the Mystery than she lets on. 2 more Burton Favourites, Martin Landau and Lisa Marie, give Small but Vital performances and they do Quite well. The One performance that seems out of place is Casper Van Dien's, he is Obviously not the greatest actor, and among all of those Great Talents, he Sticks out like a Sore Thumb. Christopher Walkan is a Striking Figure as the Headless Horseman.<br />An All-Round Perfect Horror film, for Modern Audiences andfor Lovers of Old Fashioned Horror. \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" is among Burtons Very Best, which also makes it one of the Horror Genres best, and most Unique.
B000056VIY|5.0|J~LO'S NEW ALBUM IS A GREAT IMPROVMENT FROM ALBUM (ON THE 6). ONE OF MY FAVORITE TRACKS IS THE R&amp;B FLAVORED (THATS NOT ME) IT BLEW ME AWAY!HER VOICE IS NO WHITNEY, BUT HAS OVER THE YEAR IMPROVED, WITH MUCH STRONGER VOCALS.ONE THING THAT IM MISSING ARE MORE BALLADS. BUT DONT GET ME WRONG, THE SONG ( COME OVER) SURE DID GIVE ME A FEVER!!!!!J~LO IS A GREAT LEADER FOR THE LATIN COMMUNITY, AND EVERYONE NEEDS TO STOP HATIN, AND INSTEAD GO BUY HER ALBUM!!!!
B00005B4GU|5.0|I am a pretty good fan of Radiohead.As soon as I heard Creep I knew they were good.Pablo Honey,The Bends,and OK Computer were all great,but then came Kid A and now Amesiac.Kid A was better than the three before,but Amesiac blows them all away.Its like all four albums blended together.It has more of a Kid A sound to it.I like there new stuff more then there old.As soon as you put it in the cd player you are hooked.Packt Like Sardines in a Crushed Tin Box is amasing.Then into the piano driven Pryamid Song.After that comes Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors which it the best song on the cd.Tom's voice is a electronic voice with very little lyrics.It has the best beat I ever heard before in my life.It is a brilliant song.I think they were tried of hearing about OK Computer so they went in a new direction.It was a good choice.There new sound is like no one elses and it is awesome.Thank you Radiohead for giving us another BRILLIANT record.
B00005B4GU|4.0|It had been said in the media and among certain circles that &quot;Amnesiac&quot; would be more accessible, more mainstream than the widely acclaimed &quot;Kid A&quot; was. However, that is not the case. If anything, it's even more eccentric and heavily influenced by electronic sounds. It's not a happy record (none of theirs are), and at times its not even a very listenable record. But it is something that is very moody, and very respectable. I say respectable because even if you don't want to listen to it all the time, it's still one that you will be proud to have in your collection. If you want a fast paced, poppy record, get the newest Weezer. If you want something that;s brooding, and obtuse, and dificult, yet at the same time amazing in a way, get Amnesiac.
B00003CXN4|5.0|Great story with multi faceted story only slightly marred by overuse of cross processed film techniques.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park is one of the greatest bands ive heard in a while. Their songs are excellent with amazing lyrics and vocals. Some hardcore might be dissapointed bc it does have a little rap in it and alot dont go for that...but believe me, i am a hardcore fan and i love this band. This band is great in many ways and takes rock to the next level.
B00005IBGQ|5.0|Rufus is an artist who deserves much more attention than he already has!  After having won acclaim with his first album, expectations were high for Poses.  Luckily, he's met them brilliantly!  Poses is definately different than his debut CD- it has less of a nostalgic feel.  That's mostly due to his change of producer, but this isn't a criticism at all.  Rufus' gift for melody really shines through on this CD.  The only disappointment is Evil Angel, which could have been much more powerful than it is (and even in its failure is extremely powerful). All in all, the CD is an amazing piece of work.  Let's hope we don't have to wait another three years!
B000002NJS|5.0|I remember the day I baught this album on March 3rd 1998.  It was way before Napster.  Remember the time you actaully has to wait to here the record till it was released.  Well I remember putting this CD in my stereo, and being completley mesmorized.  Every song was better than the next.  Three years later I am still listening to this perfect piece of art, and it hits me everytime I listen to it.   Madonna is truly at her best with this record.  At the time she had come off the making of &quot;Evita&quot; had a baby girl, and was very much single.  When Madonna vanished from the public eye in 1997 for a full year people were wondering if she would ever have a successful pop album again.  All that time Madonna was working on &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; and boy did her work pay off.  This may be the very best album ever put out by ANYONE and CERTAINLY by any female artist.   The album opens with the incredible &quot;Drowned World/Substitute For Love&quot; and ends with the haunting &quot;Mer-Girl.&quot;  In between you here now smash hits such as &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; &quot;Frozen&quot; and &quot;The Power Of Goodbye!&quot;  This is truly the most timeless album Madonna has ever put out, and will always be a huge milestone in her amazing career.
B000002UAO|5.0|The song 'In My Life', which many people consider the best beatles song, and possibly one of the best pop songs ever, is by itself worth the price of this album. Add to that  beatles classics like Norwegian Wood (a song that John wrote about an affair he had), Nowhere Man (which addresses the  feelings of uselessness that most of us sometimes feel), Girl, If I Needed Someone and Michelle, and you have an album that's worth it's weight in gold. The only song I do not really care for on this album is the country-ish &quot;What Goes On&quot;, sung by Ringo. All in all, one of their best, and that's saying a lot.
B000002J1O|5.0|I bought this LP when I was a mere 15 years old in 1973. I already owned Trespass, Nursery Cryme, and Foxtrot, and expected nothing but excellence. I wasn't disappointed. Now, at 43, I still listen to the CD (my LP has long since worn out) on a regular basis. How can I not? It's absolutely brilliant.<br />Selling England is the point where the band fully showed their mastery of the illusional, mystical, and mood-evoking pieces that the Gabriel-era Genesis was famous for. The production was phenomenal, with the exception of Phil's drums being somewhat understated. <br />I won't go on at length about the individual tracks except to say that, in spite of Tony Bank's later comments about the album being a bit weaker than &quot;Foxtrot&quot; or &quot;The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway&quot; (in terms of individual songs), I personally feel this album has a cohesion that displays the best Genesis ever had to offer. I have just about everything this band has ever recorded and this is the best. If you're just dabbling in progressive-rock, or wanting to learn more about the history of Genesis, don't pass this one by.
0385335482|5.0|If you are crazy about shopping?  Or the majority of your clothes still have tags?  This is a hilarious book written just for you.  Sometimes, it cuts a little too close to home, but you empathize with her.  I laughed out loud on many occasions.
0783240503|5.0|This may be a light-hearted children's musical, but I found the production to be, well just SUPERB. The creative use of the children in a school theatre setting, the lighting, the sets and the costumes are very well done. Visually, it is a feast! Yes, there were some risque scenes, that makes me think twice about showing it to children. How come? This is a musical designed for kids? About one of the most moral characters in the Bible. However, there is a control, it's called 'the fast forward button'. Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber certainly take the micky out of the Elvis cult by portraying Pharoah as 'The King'. I liked this piece of satire, especially when he rips of his headpiece and shows that 50's hair-style! Musically, the show has plenty of energy and some pathos. Donny Osmond's rendition of 'Close Every Door', is sung very slowly and is full of emotion and feeling. It is the highlight of the show. I felt that Joan Collins did an excellent job as the narrator. Overall, I would say, get it! It is an excellent, colourful production and will become a classic.
B00005B4GU|2.0|How can Radiohead possibly get more &quot;progressive&quot; than this? That's what I want to know. If Radiohead produced a song out of distorted farts and a jaw harp, critics would hail it as a &quot;Progressive masterpiece!&quot; Half the songs on this album aren't even songs--they're just mumbling, blubbering, lackluster pieces of electronic crap. &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; and &quot;Knives Out&quot; are particularly good, but most of this album is difficult to listen to--it totally lacks any emotion or energy. And how can they perform this &quot;stuff&quot; live? Do they &quot;rock out&quot; on stage with a bunch of synthesizers. Come on! What happened to the army of guitars from &quot;The Bends&quot; or &quot;OK Computer.&quot;  Well, needless to say, I'm not giving Radiohead anymore credit just because they are Radiohead. Unless they regress and create some actual music, I'm not giving them my money. I don't care if it's artistically improper to regress. I just want some music with emotion. Give me The Bends!
B00005B4GU|5.0|Although Amnesiac was recorded during the same sessions as Kid A, to me it is an album of its own.  Many may disagree with me, but I think this album is much better than Kid A (and I love Kid A).  There are parts of Kid A that are hard to grasp (musically that is--Radiohead's lyrics are always hard to grasp), but Amnesiac feels more even than Kid A.  I see it as a cross between Kid A (with the electronic vibes) and OK Computer (with some more accessible melodies and instrumentation).  A very good album.  Easily the best and most original I've heard in a long time.  It's amazing that this is the same band that made Pablo Honey and The Bends (although those are great albums too).
0440180295|5.0|\\"God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom always to tell the difference.\\"   People throughout life struggle to understand who they really are, and where they belong in this world.   By reading Slaughterhouse-5 one will come closer to accepting the \\"reality\\" about life.  The story tells the journey of Billy Pilgrim.  From the infamous fire bombings of Dresden during his army days in WWII and through his life in the planet Tralfamadore, the reader will learn how Billy Pilgrim views today's world.   His \\"so it goes\\" attitude, his beliefs of manipulating time, and his other quirky characteristics will compel you to admire him.  Mainly considered one of world's great anti-war books, it is not written in the usual war book style.  Kurt Voneggut evades all the grueling details about war; instead completely focus on Billy's reflection of war and his world.  The story is told to the reader by random flashbacks, which makes the book appear as puzzle pieces.  All these pieces fall into place to give us a complete picture only in the end, a technique similar to one that is used in \\"Cat's Cradle\\" another Voneggut classic.  Voneggut uses his usual black humor, sarcastic tone and unique imagination to deliver a story that warms our hearts but yet makes us aware of the ugly truth of our own existence that we do not want to know.  This is as good as it gets folks!  So it goes.
B0000508U6|5.0|I absolutely loved this album. Despite all of the comparisons, Coldplay sounds really unique. Every single song on this thing sounds different and each one is really good. I can hardly wait to hear more from this band! If you appreciate lots of different types of music and have an open mind- buy this album, but if you aren't open to new things and want pop- don't. Give this album a chance- I promise you won't regret it!
B00005B4GU|4.0|If Kid A depicted approaching a vista to a new world, Amnesiac is over the horizon.  Kid A had a tentative experimental feel to it, a large part of it's charm whereas Amnesiac is more polished, confident, optimistic and far more melocic.  It sounds less complete that Kid A as an overall composition and seems to be more outakes from the Kid A sessions.  Having said all that, I think this album is fantastic.  The band pulls more effectively from other music genres, as can be heard in the dixieland death march background in the last tune, &quot;glass house&quot;.  The first song &quot;sardines&quot; has a very dance techno vibe to it, something they just dipped into in Kid A.  I especially like the eirie &quot;pull/pulk revolving doors&quot; with it's hypnotic backbeat playing as sparse melodies creep in.  If you liked Kid A, you need this album.
6303212379|5.0|The Goonies is a childrens movies that grasps you as a child, and keeps you amused as an adult.  Having watched this movie first at the age of five, I can still honestly say, that fifteen years on I am still enthrawled by it.  Its witty humour and basic story line, makes it a definate video to put on when those come down days arrive.  A must for all children, and all adults who are still children at heart.
B00005A0RI|5.0|The Charlie Haden Quartet West recordings received very good reviews but in my opinion they were all too stiff sounding due to Ernie Watt's sax playing. Here, the music/musicians, composition, recording, and the overall ambience of the recording is much more languid, inviting, and involving to listen to - there is feeling in the delivery of the songs and that is the recipe for this album's success. This is like Missouri Sky but a zest and zing in the flavor. Send the kids to bed, dim the lights, and here's Charlie...
B00005B4GU|5.0|Those praying for a departure from the &quot;difficult&quot; textures of Kid A, will find much to like here. Or should I say love. Gone are the intriguing ideas and experimental soundscapes that made their last disc such a trip to the dentist. Instead, Thom and the boys have crafted a song cycle consisting of senstive love songs set against blistering guitar bravado. Instead of cryptic lyrics, we are blessed with rhyming couplets mirroring the confusion and simple dreams of just plain folks. Radio-friendly hooks abound. An unexpected guest vocal by Gwen Stefani on the disc's hidden track only adds icing to what is already a tasty cake. Rejoice! Radiohead is back in a big way.
B00005ATQC|1.0|Although the direction was interesting, the story line and acting were so slow, I could have gone out for a coffee and danish and not missed a thing.  The last scene was thought provoking, but I'm sorry I sat through the whole thing to get to it.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|This film is somewhat out there when you first watch it, but overall it was an amazing experience.  Ewan and Nicole did a superb job bringing their characters to the screen and I was amazed at their vocal abilities as well.  If you are any type of romantic you must see this film.
B00000DCHD|5.0|Billy Joel became a star based on the success of the album that preceeded this, &quot;The Stranger.&quot; Like that album, &quot;52nd Street&quot; contains more stories of Billy's life in New York. From the overplayed &quot;My Life,&quot; to the magnificent &quot;Half a Mile Away,&quot; there really isn't a bad track on this album. Check out &quot;Rosalinda's Eyes.&quot;
B00005B4GU|5.0|I can listen to this album as I'm laying in bed and picture instances of my life that go along with the revolutionary music. I can say that with just one other artist and that is Tool. I feel that they are both in a league of their own, significantly superior to any other band out there right now.          Radiohead's new masterpiece, &quot;Amnesiac&quot;, is truely a work of art. That can't be said for many other albums. There are a couple of weak tracks, I'm not going to point them out because I feel that you should listen to it for yourself instead of having someone tell you if a song is bad. If I were to do that I would be just as bad as MTV. My personal favorites are &quot;Packt Like Sardines In a Crushed Tin Box&quot;, &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot;, &quot;Pyramid Song&quot;, &quot;You and Whos Army&quot; and &quot;Morning Bell/Amnesiac&quot;. These songs truely point out just what type of band, for some reason I feel that calling them a band doesn't even come close to describing what they are, that they have become. As I have mentioned in the title, idiots shouldn't buy this cd because I don't think the same person that thinks the Backstreet Boys and 98 Degrees are great would think the same of Radiohead. Radiohead is an experience to be had, not just a song to listen to as you moon people in the car next to you or download on Napster without a guilty conscience.
B00004SZBU|5.0|It's been nearly a quarter century since this album was released, and still I can listen to it for hours without tiring of it. The early criticism was that it didn't fit with the music of the day. I think that's why it stands today as such a great album. The Meatloaf/Jim Steinman collaboration is one borne of the love that each had for theatrics. This album is best when it soars to new heights that few have dared climb. Almost operatic in nature, yet very sexual in context, &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; combined genres with ease. There is not a bad track on this album. Best are the title track and &quot;Paradise by the Dashboard Light.&quot;
B00003CXN4|5.0|I missed this movie in the theatre, but now I own the DVD.  This is a must have DVD.  It will grab you by the throat and won't let go.  When the ending credits started rolling at the end of the movie, I found myself still glued to my TV, wondering why the movie was so short!  Then I looked at the time and discovered that the movie was 2 hours and 20 minutes.  This is a great movie.  Douglas is at the top of his acting.  There are a lot of people in this movie, there are different stories about different families, but it is easy to keep track of all of them, and get lost in the middle. The picture on the DVD is very good, and the 5.1 DD sound will not make your ear drums explode but it matches the movie perfectly.  Like I said, this is a must have movie.
B00004SYWZ|5.0|They seem to have come full-circle with this album. The lyrics are wiser, matured with life's experience. I like a-ha quite a bit and I suppose that anyone else who has followed their work will appreciate this album. This album is hardly a product of its time like HUNTING HIGH AND LOW was. HUNTING HIGH AND LOW was very much an 80's album (one of the best) that has transcended that decade and is eternal at least for me. I would call MINOR EARTH MAJOR SKY a product of time. It could only have come about as a result of time and all that implies. Esoteric, perhaps. Listen to `Velvet.' `Velvet' is a whimsical atmospheric piece of sheer beauty. You have to hear it to appreciate this great melodic piece of elegant impressionism. Only a-ha could deliver such a song. Each song on this album is a rare treasure that many of us waited for never really knowing if we were ever to hear from a-ha again. I really had to listen to this album for over a period of a year before I even attempted to write this review. It is hard to put into words what I feel about this album but somehow I think this is their best work.
B00005221L|5.0|This is the BEST movie I have ever see in my life. When I watch Predator it feels like I am watching a documentary! The movie is so real. The plot is terrific, absolutely unpredictable and does not have any hole. The actions, the horrors and special effects will blow you away. Every time I watch Predator, I feel like I am watching it for a first time. It always keeps me on the edge of my chair. I have never experienced anything like that with any other movie. I like Predator much more than Terminator 2. Even though the Terminator is one of my favorites. Clearly, the movie is not for family viewing, because it is scary. If you have never see it before, you must to see it. Buy it or rent it as soon as possible. Highly, highly recommended!
B00004TH7Z|5.0|It is a wonderful and schocking comeback! Nobody would have expected to listen to such a great IM music again! The troopers in complete formation did it again! Together with Hammerfall's &quot;Glory to the Brave&quot;, Nocturnal Rites &quot;Sacred Talisman&quot;, Rhapsosy's &quot;Legendary Tales&quot; or Gamma Ray's &quot;Somewhere out of space&quot;, this album maintains our hope that true heavy metal will never die, despite conter-attacks from non-value bands like Limp Biskit or similar! Long live Rock'n Roll! Metal forever!
B000002BSV|4.0|COMING UP is the third album released by Suede and the first one to be recorded completely without their original guitarist, Bernard Butler.  It's a lot more glam, a lot louder and a lot more fun than their albums that came before it.  Unlike the mostly soulful music that they had been producing up to this point, this CD would be quite at home playing on your car stereo on the way to a trashy club or a disco.  It's not dancing music, but it's definitely party music.  <br />The music is intense and noisy.  The lyrics are rhythmic and effective.  It combines the right amounts of David Bowie and T. Rex while still managing to drag the remains of the previous Suede kicking and screaming into the mix.  It's fast in all the right places and slow when it needs to be.  Brett Anderson has a real knack for creating lyrics that sound like they were born out of the music rather than just being tacked on afterwards.  The result is that his voice almost sounds like another musical instrument at times rather than just a vessel to deposit words in.  It's just icing on the cake that the words he has come up with are wonderful at describing the various scenes of alternating decadence and depravity.<br /> It's bubble-gum, it's loud, it's dirty and it's wonderful.  Very few bands could get away with writing fun songs about drug-addicted ravers and teenagers sniffing glue, but Suede succeeds with flying colours.  Highly recommended.
B000059ZLH|5.0|I'm not a huge dream theater fan, but i picked up the DVD becuase John Petrucci will be playing w/ Satriani and Vai this summer.  God this concert is friggin amazing, buy this now if you like progressive rock.  The commentary by the band is top notch and very informative/amusing.  BUY THIS NOW DO NOT HESITATE!
B00005IBGQ|5.0|Okay, so and but I was pretty much in love with Rufus Wainwright and his first self-titled CD for like months and months when I first got it, but with Poses he takes everything, his vocals, his lyrics, his subject matter, etc., to a whole new level of maturity and just all-around awesomeness.  I have only just within the last like half-hour gotten beyond the first four tracks of the CD, the last day and a half being dedicated simply to replaying those four songs over and over, unable to get enough.  He's the coolest the coolest and I would go out of my way to say so any day.
B00000JMQC|5.0|Dorothy travels back to Oz, only to find it taken over by the Knome king. The cast is wonderful, but the story line is the real spledor here. It's not a sequal to the original, but rather an entirely new film that does the books proper justice. The bet scene by far is Princess Momby playing the Piccalo thing in the beautiful palace, before returning the head. It's just to classic! Please watch this movie, it's delightfully chilling and not too difficult to understand. Every detail is justified. Everything in Oz is some sort of subset of Dorethy's experience, but includes thed twist of the original, wondering whether Dorothy is dreaming, or if the reality of Oz is in actually a real place. It's just amazing!
B00000K2SD|5.0|The Matrix is a great movie  its starts when a guy named Nio is scerching for  an answer to the question that is the main idea of this movie &quot;what is the Matrix&quot; after he the answer the plot more and more intersting and dangures. The movie is staring Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne . This movvie is great and wonderfall  don't miss it!
0553296981|3.0|This was a diary with information to open eyes to effects of Nazis on innocent families.  It had an inspiring thought to live on.
B000002VTE|4.0|This album is good not as good as the first one but better overall than Pure Phase (with its five minute drones).  If your looking for melodies in your music don't look to Spiritualized to provide it.  They are more rythmic repetitive free jazz groove oriented.  I also like all the instruments and choirs, everytime you listen to it you can hear different things or concentrate on something else.  Of course it's self indulgent but in the tradition of white jumpsuit Elvis with his huge backing band.  <br />Of course not everyone would like this style of music even the long time spiritualized fans.  This a group that is constantly evolving.
0553274503|3.0|This story was deeply touching and extremely emotional. It impacted me very much because i felt so involved in the story that when all the bad things started happening, i felt very sad myself.
B00000JCB2|1.0|you have to be kidding right?  it really cant be possible that people enjoy this, i refuse to believe that. i could put together an album like this in about 2 hours, and the sad part is, i might make millions.  <br />if you like this, you simply do not like music
0060263865|4.0|I read this book in the third grade, and through the years it has always been one of my favorites. This book reminded me of how important true friendship is and it made me appreciate alot of the friendships in my life.
B00005B4GU|4.0|while not being as experimental (in my opinion) as kid A, this album isnt exactly your typical rock record (which is not a bad thing). however, i don't find it as exciting as kid A, maybe because i knew to expect such oddities as hunting bears and like spinning plates, or maybe because those avant guard pieces seem a little uninspired when compared to the brillant songs on kid A. the morning bell reworking is also pretty much unecessary, and i much prefer the original. none the less, it is still a very good album, and who knows, maybe it wil grow on me with future listenings?
0671027344|5.0|This is my favorite book EVER!! It really made me appreciate my life and eveyrthing in it. After reading this book i felt deeply impacted and felt as though i knew the character Charlie in real life! it really opened my eyes and made me think about life in a more positive, naive way, which is a frame of mind i think we should all adopt every now and then.
B000002TQV|5.0|Radiohead, with &quot;The Bends,&quot; proved to be a rare breed; a cutting edge band with pop sensibility.  The title track is about the easy song to digest on the album, as Thom Yorke sings about his fears of personal injury, commercialism, and often relationships.  After this masterful album, as we all know, they realized the incredible &quot;OK Computer,&quot; easily one of the greatest of all time.  On this album though, they are at a great stage, because they seem more pure; they aren't playing with concept albums or busting out the techno beats.  Just good, solid, creative rock for the ages.  Listen to &quot;Just,&quot; &quot;Black Star,&quot; and &quot;Street Spirit (Fade Out)&quot; for the best tracks.
B00000I78Y|5.0|System of a Down are the best band around. Undoubtedly! (is that how thats spelt?) I've owned their album for around 6 months now and fell in love with it straight away. It has so much energy in the music and certain tracks are perfect for different moods. If you're feeling energetic &quot;Sugar&quot; or &quot;Ddevil&quot; will be perfect for you. For the chilling out times &quot;Spiders&quot;, &quot;Suggestions&quot; or &quot;Mind&quot; are the mellow but not too boring tracks to listen to. I just can't wait until their new album arrives. SOAD are fantastic and I strongly advise buying this album if you like metal music. And if you ask me Serj is probably the best singer there has been for a long time!
B000001FS3|2.0|Look at all the flags and all the banners waving. They will open up their arms and you can come on in, a magic kingdom waits for you! This is average stuff really.For a real piece of 'Celtica' go up to search and type in, DONT STAND ME DOWN. I can understand why you might like this but really to me its no diffrent from say Simple Minds. An average record from an average band. The people who say that they sold out however are wrong.
B00005B4GD|5.0|This album is absolutely awe inspiring.  Their 1981 album &quot;living Eyes&quot; has been my favourite for some time now, and so this album has been quite welcomed to my machine. It has simlar background harmonies, as well as a Renaissance art-like feel, just like the LE album which came right in the heart of Wew Wave and theatrics in pop. TIWICI starts of with the title track, which i thought was too sugarine to kick start this seriously well crafted album. Nevertheless By track 2 you realise the variety of this album. Track 1 would be my only criticism. It has a pop feel with commercial bluesy guitar overtones in the chorus. 2 repetitive!If they need a hit they picked the wrong song (as per usual). Track 2 on the other hand is great rock and funk, like Prince, moving the stiffest of feet, in a pumping rhythm, and pulsating bass.Rob's vocals prove to be valuable for any R&amp;B/hip-hop artist's work in the future. &quot;Sacred Trust&quot; needs to be put on a hit teeny flick, with Drew Barrymore, and this will be number 1 in more countries than my dog has flees! ST is a Back Street Boys genre song. Great for some care-free romance! Ooh YEAH!  Weddind Day is a more serious love ballad, crafted a la Living Eyes. I thought &quot;Paradise&quot; from LE was identical in its superb organic arrangement as Wedding Day. It could not have been produced to sound more real.its the BEST. It puts the whole Still Waters production to shame. Deja Vu on the other hand is a radio friendly song, and should be an automatic hit. It has some great Rock guitars and voice overdubs, and would also do well in a movie marketed for teenagers. Finally there's Walking On Air. It is Brian Wilson inspired. It creates a surreal feel from its incredibly sweet melody in the verse. Mo does the whole thing himself, even though it sounds like a big team effort (a la Brian!). You will have this song on repeat I assure you!WARNING: SUITABLE FOR ALL AGES. Pure Pop Paradise!  This is one of the top 5 BG albums! Listen to it for yourself!
630416923X|5.0|An absolute must own for Beatles fans.  Very well done in every aspect.  The production quality is excellent.  Pace is very appropriate.  Interviews and commentary well done. This is recommended for any one serious about music history or for those who don't 'get it' regarding the Beatles.  This documentary respects the Beatles as artists and showcases their personality and individuals contributions.  I've watched it numerous times and can't get enough of it.  (I would love to own it in DVD!)
B00005BJ2O|4.0|His style is a conventional radical mix.  The accompanying musical soundtrack challenge the audience also.  For the &quot;Ballroom&quot; soundtrack included both Doris Day &quot;Perhaps perhaps perhaps&quot; and a Cyndi Lauper &quot;Time after Time&quot; remake.  In the &quot;Romeo&quot; soundtrack he had a boys choir sing Prince's &quot;When Doves Cry.&quot;  Read that it took him 2 years to get the music cleared for &quot;Rouge.&quot;  One of his soundtrack musical choices is that the disk will feature cutting edge modern artists doing new tweaked covers to popular tunes.  Bono sings &quot;Children of the Revolution.&quot;  Top 40 tunes with a lemon and lime twist!  Double barrel effort.  Leading star Nicole Kidman sings a medley of &quot;Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend&quot; and &quot;Material Girl.&quot;  Again the tone is dramatic and an exotic alley cat of creativity!  Not the usual fare, looking forward to his re-make of the musical film genre, 2001 style.
B00003CXDV|4.0|I'm not sure if it's me or not but it seems to me on the eve of the release of &quot;Evolution&quot; that there seems to be a resurrgence of sci-fi comedys in the vein of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, I.E. &quot;Men In Black&quot; and the reviewed movie here &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot;.  I had missed the theatrical release of &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; with little interest in the movie.  However I am a fan of the genre and when it came out on DVD in early May of 2000 I decided I would give it a chance and was pleasently surprised.  <br />Shows Like Star Trek and it's numerous offsprings have created a wealth of pop culture arguably as much if not more than &quot;Star Wars&quot;  and Galaxy Quest takes these items and runs with them.  The actors themselves as washed up have beens squelching off of a show which not only was cancelled 20 odd years ago but whose mainstream popularity long but died.  Its rather depressing.  However more than lively as the movie picks up with a plotline that would make any Star Trek Hack writer proud as the actors are confused for their characters by aliens who the actors mistake for fanatical fans.  I make it a bit more confusing than it actually is.  The characters are more than fleshed out in the beginning of the movie and are very likeable.<br />The only problem I have with this movie is that some of the jokes are a bit to much of an in joke...take for istance the &quot;red shirt&quot;, which any Star Trek fan can tell you is a character without a last name who is expendable and who usually dies within the first few minutes of the show.  I found that bit hilarious however wondering if other family audiences , which this film is geared for, would understand it.  However with that being said I do belive the film acomplishes it's goals and hopefully more films like it will follow.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|If you don't already know his previous 2 films - Strictly Ballroom and the modern Romeo and Juliet, you've been missing out.  Are you ready for a modern day musical to dazzle you with great style?  From the very moment this film opens it takes you on a ride.  Imaginatively creative, this film is packed!  Vibrantly alive, the audience was interactive, I heard the positive murmurings during the film.  The sets are gorgeous (the color, the details), almost all the acting was spot-on -- bravo to Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, the story was intriguing, the musical quality was uniquely done (the musical numbers -- a bridge between old and new), and the directing could have been slowed down a tad at the beginning but is the glue.  Not many films like it come around very often.  I do think this is the last film about star crossed lovers I can handle for awhile, but this film provides so much it demands you see it more than once.

B00005B4GU|5.0|Once again, Radiohead leaves the listener confounded.  Just as with OK Computer and Kid A, a first listen to AMNESIAC results in equal parts pleasure and puzzlement.  After my third listen, I'm convinced of this record's importance.  Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors comes as a shock, a cleansing of the audio pallette after the majesty of the single, Pyramid Song.  While not all rock/radio listeners will appreciate this, Radiohead is making vital electronic music.  They understand the connection between 70's art/prog rock/jazz fusion and contemporary &quot;techno&quot; (for lack of a more descriptive term).  The alternate version of Morning Bell is nice, and the almost swing-like finale Life In A Glasshouse provides some inspired lunacy.  A solid effort.

B00000295A|5.0|Out of all Jamiroquai efforts, this is the best. Jay delivers his message of consciousness with soulful passion. The horn arrangments are tight. The band hasn't played better on any of the other albums. Get this piece. I wish I could say more, but I'm at work!
0486282147|5.0|&quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; ranks as the most famous and also the best of the four Sherlock Holmes novels. It is the first Holmes novel I read as a child, and the combination of ancient curse, foreboding moor, and modern danger kept me turning the pages.<br />&quot;The Hound&quot; is unique among the Holmes novels because for a large part of the mystery, Holmes' character is offstage, appearing only at the last moment to bring events to a hair-raising denouement.<br />Holmes is a brilliant but eccentric detective.  Sometimes his personality quirks lead him into danger.  Holmes is both tenacious and audacious, and the interplay of those two qualities almost bring him to grief.  He loves to hold his cards close to his vest, and sometimes excludes others from information vital to their safety.  He also loves to engineer dramatic climaxes to highlight his deductive powers.  Holmes' joint penchants for secrecy and sensation almost gets his client killed, but all's well that ends well.<br />The Dover Thrift Edition offers quality entertainment at a rock bottom price.  Inexpensive, but definitely not cheap.
B000006Z8E|5.0|I give this disc a five star rating simply because B.M.S. is one of my all-time favourite bands;so call me biased! Seriously speaking,this recording shows a slightly more mature band than the one that recorded their first LP only months before this.As the title suggests,this record deals with man's evolution,with all lyrics in Italian. The opening tune,\\"L'Evoluzione\\" opens slowly,and progresses in a manner not unlike that of \\"Il Giardino Del Mago\\" on their first album. Beautifully melodic keyboard solos,(courtesy of the brothers Nocenzi),are the order of the day here. The next piece,the 8-minute-plus \\"L'Conquista Della Posizione Eretta\\" sounds in places like a spaghetti western,but is nonetheless mesmerising;model perhaps as an up-date on \\"Metamorfosi\\" from their previous record. The rest of the CD is composed of shorter pieces in the five minute range,highlighted by the haunting and mysterious \\"750,000 Anni Fa...L'Amore?\\" featuring some of the sweetest singing that lead vocalist Francesco Di Giacomo has ever commited to tape. All in all the band is in fine form,and while this recording has its flaws,they are obviously poised to launch their next effort IO SONO NATO LIBERO.The future looked bright indeed...and you didn't even have to wear shades!
B000009DUY|5.0|In memory of all the fallen soldiers in the invasion of the Allied Forces to Normandy on D - Day, 57 years ago, I'd like to dedicate this review.<br />  Many consider this day to be of one of the most important in the twentieth century, and for good reasons. &quot;The day the earth stood still &quot; describes correctly what was at stack. The success of this invasion made the difference and the turning point in World War II. It can be said that this was the beginning of the great victory later on.<br />  John Williams, regardless of the movie, created something unique, something I've never heard before the day I saw the film and bought the CD, and ever after.  He has succeeded in expressing with the music a variety of emotions a person experiences while watching the movie itself, or whenever thinking deeply of the events that had happened so many years ago, but not so far away.<br />Tracks like 'Revisiting Normandy' ,'Omaha Beach' ,Highscool Teacher' and of course the monumental ,one of a kind, 'hymn to the fallen' convey all of that and more, taking the listener right back to that time and place.<br />  I believe it's important this CD exits in this context to remind us, now and then, of the things that took place in the past. Often it brings me to reflect about those men out there, fighting a war of freedom, praying to do their job and stay alive to finally return home to continue every day's life. Many didn't make it. On a day like today we think about their sacrifice and remember them.<br />  I hope that any listener would give it the appropriate time to entirely sense the atmosphere the disc recreates. And it does, in a subtle and delicate-sad way. I think buying this disc can't be wrong. In the end, I can honestly say that I've never heard something that remarkable.
6305011575|5.0|i agree that it is very hard to find on amazon and i just about totally agree with everyone.  this movie was great.  The acting by the adults was horrible besides TIM CURRY who i thought should have one an award for it.  He portrayed Pennywise better than anyone could have.  He was very scary but also funny in the same way.  i think he did an excellent job.  i think everyone should see this movie and i am still disappointed that it didn't come out on dvd yet, as i will buy it the day it comes out.
0553296981|5.0|This book had som good information on it. It was scary of thinking about the Holocaust. I cant imagine myself there. I admire her so much. Just bearing through those times. But the book was great it was filled with emotions, laughter, and adventure.
B00003CXFG|1.0|This is only the second film I have seen that I considered walking out of.<br />The plot is at best predictable, the characters shallow.  The tension is laughable.  In fact at one point I even considered this a comedy, a fact supported by the non-existing acting.<br />Purchase this at your peril....there are a lot better films of the Sci-Fi genre out there....
0140177396|3.0|I enjoyed this book alot. It was a good plot. I loved the characters George and Lenny, They were very expressive about what they needed to do and say. John Stienbeck did a great job writing this book.
B000059Z8J|5.0|It's about blankety blank time!  Superman on DVD!  That simple statement should be enough to make you pull out the old wallet and get your copy NOW!  What can be said about this film that hasn't already?  Richard Donner was the only choice to direct, the casting was just about perfect, Christopher Reeve is Superman, no matter whose played him before and no matter who will ever play him again.  John Williams score takes this movie to another level entirely.  The Superman Theme going through the surround sound during the opening credits brought goosebumps.  The story is great, going from birth on Krypton, growing up in Smallville, and fulfilling his destiny in Metropolis, it's almost like you get three movies for the price of one.  And it works.  <br />There are moments that sends chills down the spine, such as Superman's first public appearance (saving Lois and the helicopter).  Some would say that Luthor is played too much for laughs, but I think it works well.  I love Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor, he has some of the best quotes in the movie.  &quot;Doesn't it just give you a... shudder of electricity to be in the same room with me?&quot;  His ego is so huge, it's wonderful!<br />Anyways, everything's been said about this movie and I agree with all the positive things. :)  So, on to the DVD!  The sound is FANTASTIC!  If you have a surround sound system, you are in for a treat!  The image is the best I've seen this movie in.  And the extras are... Wow!  The kind of extras you expect to see on a God honest movie classic making it's first show on the superior format that is DVD.  Screen tests, note the huge pools of sweat collecting on the underarms of Chris Reeve's supersuit.  Watch many an actress try their hand at Lois Lane!  Interesting stuff, all of it.  Two or three deleted scenes, nice additions.  A good commentary track with Richard Donner and I forget the other guy's name, but he pretty much wrote the movie, though he is credited as the creative consultant or something of that nature, where they discuss many things about pre-production, production, casting decisions, effects shots and so forth.  And three 20-30 minute documentaries that are very informative.  These are the kinds of docus I like to see.  They include new interviews with Donner, Margot Kidder and a real life superman, Christopher Reeve, looking good considering all the difficulties he's gone through.  Real in depth stuff.<br />All in all an American Classic that gets the DVD treatment it rightfully deserves.
B000007MVD|4.0|As much as the Beatles were loved in the USA, we were short-changed.  We thought we were getting a lot with an album every ten months, a handful of singles each year, a movie every two years, an occasional tour, and a sloppy Saturday morning cartoon.  <br />But, in the UK, the Beatles were doing stage shows--not just their own act, but pantomime and vaudeville-type things--and tons of live radio, where &quot;From Me To You&quot; was converted to &quot;From Us To You&quot; and made their signature tune.  LIVE AT THE BBC collects more than 60 of the best moments from their radio appearances in one fabulous package.<br />There are a couple odd glitches--the solo on &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; is an obvious edit of the studio solo patched over a live performance, for instance--but the vast majority of the music here is superb.  <br />The cover of &quot;Sweet Little Sixteen&quot; is fantastic, really hard stuff the way Lennon always said he preferred the Beatles to sound.  Harrison shines on &quot;Nothin' Shakin'&quot; and &quot;Everybody's Tryin' To Be My Baby.&quot;  McCartney wails on &quot;Long Tall Sally,&quot; &quot;Lucille,&quot; and &quot;The Hippy Hippy Shake.&quot;  The whole band delivers a jolt with my very favorite early Beatles rocker, &quot;Some Other Guy.&quot;<br />Ringo, as always, is the heart of the Beatles sound.  On &quot;Thank You Girl&quot; he sounds like he's going to knock the bandstand to pieces.  Why he isn't universally acclaimed as one of the 2 or 3 greatest Rock drummers of all time is beyond me.<br />This is a great record of the Beatles early days, when they were just beginning to step away from a very 1950s sound.  Who could have guessed how far they'd go in less than a decade?
B000059XUI|4.0|The DVD leaves a bit to be desired.  Here we have one of the great sequels and adventure movies out there.  One whose appeal outweighs the somewhat dated effects that we sometimes see, the bit of suspension of belief (Superman giving up his powers to be with Lois without hardly thinking about it?  Doubt it!).  Despite all this, the movie soars.  The behind the scenes disaster would have led to great extra features on this bare bones disc.  Unfortunately, we have to watch the documentaries on Superman 1 to get the juicy details of how Richard Donner was fired after completing a good chunk of the movie, causing actors to quit and so forth, and bringing in Richard Lester to finish.  This movie could have been one of the worst disaters you've ever seen.  Yet it wasn't?  Why?  Who the heck knows, the disc sure won't let you in on it.  Basically all we have here is a theatrical trailer.  After hearing John Williams great score BOOM through the surround sound on the first one, I was GREATLY disappointed to hear it sort of whimper by during the opening credits of this movie.  The picture hasn't been remastered like the first one and even the menu screens pale in comparison to the first one.  Why Warners, why skimp on us here?!!  <br />All that aside, it really is a fun movie and if you're a Superfan, you probably already know that.  This has great goosebump inducing scens as well.  The scene where Supes makes his triumphant return to face off against Zod and his cronies.  That great scene where Superman finally kneels before Zod, all is looking lost, Superman takes Zod's hands, squeezes, the Supes theme kicks in and dang!  That's some great stuff!  It's also great seeing Gene Hackman's humorous Lex Luthor pairing up with the more straight General Zod.  Cool stuff in Niagra Falls and so on make this a very worthy sequel, indeed. It is definatly worth getting on DVD, if only to see it in widescreen.  You know, plus the whole quaility last longer advantage DVD has over VHS.
6301735048|3.0|This is by far the worst Tony Scott film ever made. God rest Anthony Quinn but no offense. I can really see why it was not a successful movie. It was very Low budget. Don Simpson and Jerry Bruchiemer should of produced this movie and it might of been better.

0452282152|1.0|The author, Chevalier, had a good idea of weaving a story around a famous painting, but this book is a big let-down; it was downright boring. Considering that Chevalier has a degree in creative writing, she does a poor job writing this book creatively. The characters are dull and lifeless. What's more, you just don't care about any of the people in this book. The ending is so predictable - I didn't even have to read it. I don't know how anyone can rate this book highly or recommend it, and I can't believe it made it to the New York Times bestseller list.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I bought this c.d. this afternoon and have just finished listening to it for the first time. Now it hasn't sunk in yet and it will take repeated listenings before I can have a true opinion of the record but this five stars is for first impressions. It sounds as though it is an incredible album. It is very similar to &quot;Kid A&quot; in some ways such as the electronic sound and crazy beats but it sounds as though it may even be better due to more warm songs and a slight return to more structured songs on such tracks as &quot;Knives Out&quot; and &quot;You and Whose Army?&quot;. The c.d. is very dynamic and goes from beautiful ballads like &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; to almost industrial techno like &quot;Pulk/Pull Revovling Doors&quot;. Every song is unique and every song sounds great in it's own right. This is a very original sounding album which is a hard thing to come across nowadays but we always have a few bands to rely on for something original and Radiohead is one of them. For the sake of the great sound of this album and for its originality it diserves five stars easily from first impressions. And I'm sure that my opinion will only rise with repeated listenings. Radiohead Fans: Don't walk but run to your local record store to buy this one.
6305127638|4.0|While I very much enjoyed 'First Contact' it left me asking a few questions...such as how did they come to all be on the new Enterprize E?  Or when/where/why did Geordi get Ocular Implants? Or my personal favorite: why did they alter established Trek History with the way they handled First Contact with Zephram Cochran?  Albeit only the true Trek nerds will understand that last one, but it seemed to me as though the story was unfolding before I came in at the beginning and I feel like I missed something important, and left me wanting more.  Now while wanting more is a good thing, it isn't necessarily so good when you feel that the storyline was incomplete, even if by just a little.<br />With that criticism out of the way, and I apologize it if is too big, but other than that, I very much enjoyed this 2nd outing on the big screen for the Next Generation.  It allowed a lot of humor which had been missing from the previous film, and gave us an exciting story mixed with a great deal of Trek History (even if it was altered a bit to suit Studio heads).  The effects were as usual top notch and while I am STILL waiting for a Trek movie to deal with the greatest nemesis the Next Gen folks ever faced (namely 'Q') I am fervently hoping that Paramount will give the folks a chance to redeem what a fiasco 'Insurrection' ended up being (not unlike how Trek VI more than made up for how horrible Trek V was...).  Folks, contact your Congressman, or whoever it takes to convince Paramount that a 4th Next Gen movie IS possible and SHOULD be made--provided they actually come up with a decent script.
0790729644|5.0|very well put together Clint did a great job acting and directing, makin this academy award winner.  Based on the story of William Money (an older William Money) and two friends out to collect money for what two men did too a whore.  Some parts are comical but soon gets serious.  There are a few classic lines comin out of this movie but a classicmovie for sure.
B00003CXRP|5.0|I went to see Cast Away with some trepidation.  Although I enjoy Tom Hanks' acting, I wasn't at all sure that he could carry the movie given what I'd heard about it, and his promotional appearances and interviews didn't quell my misgivings.  But I'm pleased to report that I was totally won over.  Quite simply, this is Hollywood at its best.  Although it dips rather expectedly into a bit of the sentimentality of Forest Gump in the final few minutes, all involved can be forgiven on the strength of the rest of the film.  That Hanks lost the Oscar for best actor to Russell Crowe of Gladiator is only proof that the Oscars are devoid of whatever artistic integrity they might once have had.  Hanks, in his role as Chuck Noland, is superb in this film.  I was surprised that critics and reviewers haven't made more of what I saw to be the real core of the film--the drama of Noland's return.  While watching Noland (the name can't be coincidental!) surviving through ingenuity on his island was fascinating, the story's emotional heart is played out upon his return, when he finds out he's been cast away by his fiancee.  The depiction of the deeply conflicted couple trapped in a horrible situation between love and responsibility was completely convincing.  Most highly recommended.
B00004Z4WR|3.0|i thought this was going to be horrible but i found it entertaining with some really nice cars in it.  Some bad acting and weak parts which the director could of played around with more but overall not to shabby.  good for most ages i believe.
B000056K04|5.0|Finally DMB has graduated from the school of &quot;noodlin'&quot; to become a serious recording group. If you like tight, radio-friendly hit songs that you can listen to in the car/shower/kitchen, DMB has finally made a record for you. If, on the other hand, you prefer to devote an afternoon listening in a dark room with headphones so you can bond with your musical Dalai Lama (DMB, Phish, Pink Floyd, Radiohead), this album isn't your cup of Earl Grey. And that's fine; just don't criticize them for selling out or going commercial. Its called maturing, something that's lacking in music and people today.
B00005B4GU|4.0|You can't avoid comparing Radiohead's last two albums, since they were recorded around the same time. Amnesiac is an odd beast of a record, moreso than its predecessor, the postmodern masterpiece Kid A. It's not as cohesive as Kid A, but Amnesiac possesses standout songs that, aside from 'Optimistic', Kid A was lacking. Kid A was a chasm of nihilism, with very little signs of daylight, but Amnesiac rises up out of Radiohead's dark, dreary depths to show the listener a bit of humanity, only to slam the door shut again. <br />It's same, but different. There's more of the same artsy techno twiddling in the remarkable 'Packt Like Sardines In A Crushd Tin Box' and 'Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors', a drowsy, dreary ballad (You And Whose Army'), a jazz horn section (Dixieland instead of free jazz, on 'Life In A Glasshouse'), an instrumental ('Hunting Bears', which is better than Kid A's 'Treefingers'), and even a reworking of a Kid A song in 'Morning Bell/Amnesiac', with the line &quot;put the kids to bed&quot; changed to the more deliciously nasty &quot;cut the kids in half.&quot; However, Amnesiac comes off sounding completely different from Kid A, partially because of the even odder studio tweaking some songs get, but also because of a group of songs that are among the best Radiohead have ever recorded.<br />Amnesiac at its best is simply thrilling. 'Dollars And Cents' is a searing rant about capitalism and globalization, featuring some of Thom Yorke's most pointed lyrics (&quot;We are the dollars and cents/we are the pounds and pence/we're gonna crack your little souls&quot;). 'You And Whose Army' is the mopey Yorke from 'How To Disappear Completely' finally being brave enough to sound confrontational, while the surprisingly brisk 'Knives Out' and the terrific 'I Might Be Wrong' show that Radiohead can still groove a bit. But the flat-out great song on Amnesiac is 'Pyramid Song', a jarring, spine-tingling, piano-driven song that seems to hint about ancient Egyptian beliefs,specifically the River of Styx, the massive river of filth a dead soul had to cross before reaching the afterlife: &quot;I jumped in the river and what did I see?...all my past and futures...there was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt.&quot;<br />But midway through 'Hunting Bears', Amnesiac loses its momentum a bit before grinding to a halt in the funereal 'Life In A Glasshouse'. It's only a minor gripe, but it's also enough to make Amnesiac seem less of a complete album as Kid A. Amnesiac's highs are very high, and its lows are pretty high as well. It all adds up to a very good album.<br />Thom Yorke decribed the title 'Amnesiac' as being about how &quot;when we are born we are forced to forget where we have come from in order to deal with the trauma of arriving in this life.&quot; Yorke may be speaking some truth, but his band's music also helps the rest of us get through our lives, and with the epochal duo of Kid A and Amnesiac, it's music we will not forget anytime soon. We'll all look back on the past eight months as a time when, during a very cynical, empty time in pop music history, Radiohead's music was music that, for one brief shining moment, mattered.
B00005B4GU|2.0|Radiohead's fifth LP, &quot;Amnesiac&quot; is actually quite interesting... Far more interesting than the overrated &quot;Kid A&quot;, in the sense that whereas &quot;Kid A&quot; eschewed song structure altogether for the luxury of a wider palette of electronic noise, &quot;Amnesiac&quot; actually feels closer to the classic &quot;The Bends&quot; in its intimacy and desolate sonic landscape... Er, but not quite! Though several of the songs, such as &quot;Packt Like Sardines&quot; [sic], the eulogy-like &quot;Life In a Glasshouse&quot;, and &quot;Knives Out&quot; are understated mostly-acoustic masterpieces, others, such as &quot;pulk/Pull&quot; and &quot;Hunting Bears&quot; thoroughly, and ultimately, drown &quot;Amnesiac&quot; in meaningless noise. I do understand that the great bands evolve: The Beatles from Merseybeat to utter genius, The Who and Jam from mere mods to two of the greatest bands of all time, etc. etc. However, I believe Radiohead has already come full-circle, from grunge-lite wannabes in &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; to the breath-taking and utterly genre-defying beauty of &quot;The Bends&quot; and &quot;O.K. Computer&quot;... It is utterly senseless for this great band to try to join the frays of avant-garde when what they do best is write within the song structure! Kinda like Michael Jordan playing winter-league baseball with the Scottsdale Scorpions! The avant-garde as deconstruction is better-served by the Residents, Marc Ribot, even The Magnetic Fields... Radiohead is merely the best Rock 'N Roll Band in The Planet. Whether they care to admit it or not.
B000000WA2|5.0|The great escape is through buying this album, opening yuor mind to a world of possibilities, and not getting stuck in an infernal rut like the characters within it, a sorry world of automatons, stereotypes, caricatures, cliches, mannequins, marionettes and gibbering ventriloquist's dummies.  <br />After the enjoyable Cockney charade of 'Parklife', this is the real thing: a complete nightmare vision, Pynchon's model of informaiton overload leading to entropy and inertia.  Despite the 60s aesthetic of many songs, and the spanking 90s modernity of the production, this is a worldview belonging to the 70s, that of Monty Python's stockbrokers, suicidal Reggie Perrin, Martin Amis, Mike Leigh.  It is a world where prosperity and progress lead to mindless repetition - the recurrent figure in these songs is the circle: the waltz that surprisingly concludes 'Mr Robinson's Quango'; the fairground roundabout tinkles, where innocence has been replaced by infantilisation.<br />There is no escape in Damon's bleak lyrics.  The respite, the possibilities, come in the music, in this, Blur's most restlessly inventive album.  At the time of its release, there was a hyped struggle between Blur and Oasis, but there is no comparison between the latter's laddish monotone, and Blur's musical intelligence.  Each song on this album tells of a regimented life grinding to a halt; each song fizzes with musical ideas, pilfered from a vast store of influences, the 60s rock canon, 70s post-punk, 80s American art-rock, Europop, muzak, 'Sound Gallery'-esque functionalism, film soundtracks, lounge music, left-field experimental pop (e.g. Stereolab), half-remembered fragments from TV ads and children's programmes.  <br />The variety is not only between songs, but in them, where the rock-ska stomp of 'Quango' is interrupted by a bizarre trumpet fantasia, or the incongruous 'Um's that deadpan through 'Top man'.  <br />People have accused Damon of being too 'ironic', perhaps feeling cheated that songs asvisionary and beautiful as 'The Universal' or 'yoku and Hiro' are actually dystopian satires of late capitalism; but surely the emotion lies in the tension between the universalising designs of the corporations decried in the lyrics, and the universal, human emotions they want to repress, expressed in the gorgeous, aching music.
0395925037|4.0|This book may not be a great literary peace of art but it's a good token for history. In the book Hitler does call Jews, Commusist, Catholics, etc. bad names and says bad things about them; but in Mark Twain's book &quot;Huck Finn&quot; don't blacks get bad titles? So if your not going to read the book for that reason it's a bad choice! Don't get me wrong I'm not a Nazis actually I'm a Roman Catholic and I still read the book and thought it was good for history reasons. Only one thing he does ramble alot and you must be willing to suffer through it. It does show one of the most intelligent minds with the most bad intentions&gt;
B000002GVO|2.0|To say that this CD is great .... is absurd !!! The gap between the sheer quality and creativity of the title track (HOTEL CALIFORNIA) and the rest of the songs in this trash is so enormous that you keep wondering if it were the same guys who recorded it !!! Even in the lyric department the difference is absurd. WHile \\"HOTEL CALIFORNIA\\" has substance and a different lyric, the rest of the songs lyrics is just plain cheesy (love, love, girls, heartbreak, and son on so on...). It seems some genius or saint appeared suddenly of the blue and gave the inspiration to the band write HOTEL CALIFORNIA. THen ther saint was gone and the band wrote the rest of the material...
1558908358|3.0|I have absolutely loved this film since I first saw it back in th 80's.  I give it 5 stars.  The DVD only gets 2 stars though.  What is actually on the DVD (the movie basically) is great, but there is SO much more that SHOULD be there!<br />Back 1995 a LaserDisc version of Tron was released that contained full length commentaries, deleted scenes, publicity materials, and lots of behind-the-scenes stuff.  Why isn't all of this material on THIS DVD???  There is no good technical reason; DVD's hold more than LaserDisks, and all the hard work of remastering and organizing the material was done when the LaserDisk was produced.  At this point very little work is required to get this material into the DVD format.<br />Personally, I'm going to hold out until they put all the material from the LaserDisk version onto DVD.
B00002NDB1|1.0|With this album, MAIDEN reached a climax in its long downhill ride in the nineties, beginning in 1989 when guitarrist Adrian Smith left the band after the tour promoting the amazing album &quot;SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON&quot;. Then, engulfed by total lack of creativity, Janick Gers on guitar and the ausence of Martin Birch producing (Steve Harris assumed the realms of production with questionable quality), the band entered the nineties releasing a bunch of bad albuns. After two of them (NO PRAYER FOR THE DYING and FEAR OF THE DARK), singer Dickinson sensed it was time to leave and endep up recording two metal master pieces: ACCIDENT OF BIRTH and THE CHEMICAL WEDDING. Maiden, supported by its huge legion of devoted fans (including myself) managed to survive through the nineties. But the hiring of Blaze Bayley and the release of such two disgraceful albuns as X FACTOR and this one Im reviewing were the bottom for them. Or did they do something about it or it was better to finish the band. They decided to bring back Dickinson and SMith, and it worked. As for Virtual Eleven, it is the only Maiden album I dont own. I sold mine to the store.
B00004XONN|5.0|Ok, so why is this so harshly experimental?  The first time I listened to Kid A, I didn't think it was strange at all. It felt completely right and very &quot;melodic&quot; to me.  It seemed to be a completely logical step for Radiohead.  After a while I did realize there weren't that many guitars, but so friggin' what!  Are people so musically sheltered, that the absence of a guitar makes them think they are listening to John Cage or something.  The bottom line, this album is just beautiful and deserves to be listened to........A LOT!
B00005B4GU|5.0|If you liked Kid A, buy this album. I can imagine a lot of people criticizing this album because they didn't shift styles of music, because it shares similarities with Kid A. Don't let that stop you from enjoying this great cd. It is a masterpiece, swooping from sad, inevitable pain to triumphant peaks of glory.
B00005B4GU|1.0|Quite possibly the worst album I've ever listened to all the way through.  It's one thing to \\"grow\\" and \\"experiment\\" as a band(famous last words ususally), but Radiohead would never have gotten a record deal to begin with if they had put [stuff]like this out. Because Pablo Honey, The Bends and OK Computer were so good, it appears that we now have to suffer through these ego-driven side projects.  If you liked their first albums, there is NO WAY you can find this CD tolerable, because it contains none of the qualities that made those albums great.  There is zero songwriting involved here;instead just a series of beeps, thumps and hisses.  It sounds like a teenager in the basement who experimenting with his new synthesizer and drum machine he just got for Christmas.  Enough with this already!  And please, you 5-star reviewers out there, don't pretend as though this is groundbreaking ingenious music. If Thom Yorke recorded himself snoring for 50 minutes you people would give it 5 stars and laud it as visionary. Just admit that you've been had for the 2nd album in a row.  Otherwise, you're just encouraging them to create another album like this one.
014028009X|3.0|I find it terribly depressing that so many women see themselves in this book.  As I read it, I became endlessly frustrated that Bridget couldn't pull herself together enough to worry about something more important than her weight or whether or not she has a boyfriend.<br />That said, &quot;Edge of Reason&quot;, where she actually DOES get a spine, and the movie, where Renee Zellweger manages a charming portrayal of Bridget, are both gems.  I'd skip this book altogether if you have little tolerance for stereotyping of women and general whininess.  See the movie, read Edge of Reason instead.
B00005B4GU|5.0|One may be hard-pressed to describe the type of music Radiohead is creating these days, but outstanding comes to mind.  Amnesiac, recorded during the same sessions as 2000's Kid A, is not dissimiliar to Kid A, but it has a very different feel.  Amnesiac opens up with the oddly named &quot;Packd Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin&quot; with Thom Yorke crooning &quot;I'm a reasonable man, get off my case.&quot;  Maybe we should, because he certainly seems to know what he is doing.  <br />The album itself is eccletic, unlike the cohesive Kid A and OK Computer albums.  There are &quot;strange&quot; (for lack of better words) songs, then &quot;normal&quot; songs mixed together.  It works.  The best tracks on the album are the emotional &quot;Pyramid Song,&quot; the guitar driven &quot;Knives Out,&quot; and the jazzy &quot;Life in a Glasshouse.&quot;  If you loved Kid A, you'll love Amnesiac.  If you didn't like Kid A, you will probably still love Amnesiac, because it is definitely more accessible and requires fewer listens to get.  Radiohead is definitely at a creative high point, and we can only guess at what this band will do next.
B000021Y7X|5.0|I saw the original movie in 1984.  I loved it so much I saw it 2 more times with a different set of friends each time.  When it became available on VHS I got it.  Finally after adding my DVD theater system, I had to get this DVD for my collection.  From the very start of the concert to the very end your are taken through a visual concert trip.  You'll love the energy of David Byrne as well as the back up band.  I cannot believe that David Byrne and the guitarist from the back up band were capable of moving and playing for as long as they did.  I almost got exhausted watching it, however it was one of the made reason's I've watched this over and over.  My favorite song is &quot;Swamp&quot;,  not as high-powered as &quot;Burning Down the House&quot;, another personal favorite, but nonetheless a low-energy favorite (watch the lamp).  Buy it, you'll enjoy from the unusual beginning to the moment they say &quot;Good-Night!
B000002JOH|3.0|...this album is one of those that has 3 or 4 good songs, and the rest are fodder.  ...The songs I like are Mouth Of War, ... This Love, and Regular People (Conceit).  Other than those 4, the songs in these songs are boring. If you want good Pantera, buy any other cd than this, especially if it's Cowboys from Hell or their live album.  Or see them live, so you can break your ribs
6305718954|5.0|I think it's very funny, that almost all bad reviews are written by people who don't understand the plot or people who are themselves part of an organized religion. This movie does somewhat accuse the church, but most of all it is meant to make you think about organized religion. Why does one need to build a church filled with beautiful statues to reach their god ? If people were to view this movie open-minded they will discover that it is a pro-religion movie, not an anti-one.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I bought Amnesiac expecting some outtakes. I was expecting an album of songs that were not good enough for the experimental album, Kid A. I expected some loud striking noises and lackluster instrumentals. Boy, was I wrong. Not only does this album manage to be slightly more straightforward, but it also heralds the return of old-school Radiohead rock with songs like &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot; (best song of the album with its country guitar and monolithic beginning) and &quot;Knives Out&quot; (with a cannibalistic theme and plodding vocals). Not to say that that Amnesiac is absent of crazy experimentation. Songs like &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot; (with its start-stop staccato clanging accompanying Thom's seemingly reversed vocals) and &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; (a crazy whirring loop that will irritate even the most insane of people). All in all, even with it's foibles, Radiohead's most recent opus is tied with OK Computer as their best album and it definately belongs in your collection.
B00003CXP1|5.0|A landmark film dealing with drugs both medicated and otherwise. Leaves you breathless, shocked, lifeless, and helpless, like the characters. The DVD transfer is crisp, highlighting the stunning camerawork, editing and sound. This is a reference quality disk in ALL capacities. Get it today.
B00003CX5P|2.0|With the way Episode 1 went, I can only hope Lucas gets his act together for Episode 2, because this film was a disaster. True, the special effects were stunning, especially the underwater giant fish, but special effects don't make a movie good. There are so many things wrong with this movie, such as:<br />a)Young Skywalker manages to destroy the bulk of an orbiting space station by &quot;luck&quot;. b)There is no Hans Solo c)Jar-Jar Binks is an idiot, and completely ruins what was left of the film.<br />d)Not enough Samuel L. Jackson or Yoda e)The plot was fairly basic<br />In conclsion, buy the first three Star Wars films, they were amazing, while this was far from it.
B00003CXSP|5.0|You know what im sick and tired of? reading bad reviews for &quot;Hannibal&quot; on the net or in the paper. it was &quot;a dissappointment&quot; here and it was &quot;done poorly&quot; there. My God--it wasn't as bad as all those critics are saying it was. What they lack to mention is the fact that MOST sequels are not as good as it's previous movie.  There are two things im reading that people are most dissappointed with: Julianne Moore taking Jodie Foster's place, and when Lecter fried Krendler's brain.  So Foster didn't play Clarice Starling--big deal! I actually think it took balls for Moore to go up there and play her after Foster's Oscar-winning performance in &quot;Silence&quot;. She did very well too. You have to admit, only she could've pulled off wearing that dress in the end.  Everyone's disturbed with the fact that Lecter fried the brains. it was in the book, for christ's sake! Actually, the book went further: Lecter cut four slices and he, Krendler AND Starling eat those pieces! The writers were just following the book.   I can't stand that they followed the book with &quot;Silence&quot; and they won 5 Oscars for it! They follow the book for &quot;Hannibal&quot; and they get eveything but good reviews in the paper! I hate that! It was not that bad!!!! I loved it, and you know there's also going to be memorizing lines from it, just like &quot;Silence&quot;. Instead of &quot;Having an old friend for dinner,&quot; its gonna be &quot;If so GOODIE GOODIE&quot; or something like that.
B000050FEN|4.0|This movie kicks a$$, and is well deserved for a New Line Platnium Edition. There's plenty of commentary from Fincher and the stars, plus deleted scenes, trailers, and alternate endings. My only complaint is that there should have been a &quot;making-of&quot; featurette, but this is by far David Fincher's best movie to date.
0440219078|4.0|This was an good book. In the begining you think I don't want to finish this but once you do you  think, wow this was great. I wonder what will happen to Jonas and Gabrial next!
0679746048|5.0|I loved this book. I just could not put it down! I was 17 when I read it last summer, and the story really hit close to home. I think it is wonderful that someone was able to put into words the experience of a borderline personality disorder. I think it is something that many people, including teens, experience but can't explain to others and probably don't quite understand it themselves. It proved to be one of the most thought-provoking current works I have read in a long time.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Hang on folks; it may take a moment to pry my hands from my face. <br />Amnesiac is awesome and interesting.  The reviews are thoughtful and I agree 100% with many of them.  Therefore, I will be short in my review.  <br />This record is truly fascinating.  When was the last time a rock band's record fascinated you?  Perhaps, Kid A.  Or maybe you passed up Kid A because it was a hard first listen at your local shop's preview booth.  Amnesiac may be no different in that respect.  But fear not brethren, while this session picks up where A left off it will bring you on a different journey altogether.  <br />If you have only budgeted a pop record for this month, spend your money elsewhere.  There are some terrific Brit pop albums out there.  If you crave uncharted musical destinations, pick up Amnesiac.  It will be a wonderful Holiday.
6301208773|5.0|I think what makes Die Hard rise above other action films of the 80s is that the hero is just a regular guy. At the time, Willis was known mainly for comedy films, so having him be an action hero let the audience actually wonder if he would make it out, unlike Stallone and Arnold's indestructible, muscle bound supermen. When McClane gets hurt, he has the injury for the rest of the film. Another thing that makes this film great is the claustrophobia. Even though it's a big building, you can't help but notice the chances of McClane and a terrorist happening upon each other are significantly increased. Also, unlike its sequels, which are also very good in their own right, there is no gaping hole in the bad guys' plan. The plot, as far as I can tell, is airtight. You'll be guarenteed a good time with Die Hard.
0684874350|5.0|Although I read it over a year ago, It was McCourt's &quot;Ashes&quot; that got me to start reading more and more books. I could not put this book down. It was absolutely WONDERFUL! In comparison to the movie......the movie is horrible. Don't even bother. It can't hardly dwelve into the depths of McCourt's mind, which is an endless canyon of heartache, desire, warmth and unsolicited humor. The book, although, is the most wonderful thing i've ever read and is soon to be a treasure in my home. Since then I've read 'Tis, which is just as mesmerizing.
B00000DHRZ|4.0|It saddens me that so many people feel the need to criticize this album. Everybody and their brother complains about how &quot;this isn't the old offspring&quot; or, &quot;it's too pop.&quot; Bands evovling aren't allways a bad thing. The term &quot;sellout&quot; has to be one of the most overused terms in the music community. People feel the need to declare a band a &quot;sellout&quot; if they slightly change their style from one album to the next. From Green Day to Korn, every band is called a sellout because they change. If you like the punkier Offspring, fine; go out and buy Ixnay on the Hombre or Smash. If you enjoy a slightly different Offspring style, buy Americana. It's a very solid album, especially &quot;The Kids Aren't Alright.&quot;
B00003CXHJ|4.0|An interesting plot, lots of action, and excellent cinematography reminecent of the classic '70's WWII movies such as Tora, Tora, Tora! and Patton.  The movie looks authentic, excellent costume design.  My only problems with the movie is the plot...  Normally, when a movie has the enemy captain captured, there is a reason... not in this one. also, the ending was exciting enough, but WHY did it end where it did...?  It seems to run out of steam at the end.  4 stars out of five for the authentic feel (even the actors maintain the same speach patterns and inflections of the old '40's movies) but minus one star for the 'why-did-it-end-there' type ending, and the non-use of the captured U-boat captain by whoever wrote the screenplay.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Amnesiac, much like the rest of Radioheads' CDs take a couple of listenings to get used to.  Once you do though, you will feel the powerful grip that their songs have over your head.  If you are not a Radiohead fan, you will be after a couple of listnenings, I guarantee it.  This Album show how Radiohead cannot do wrong.  Most people thought that Radioheads' success was going to die with the release of Kid A.  Well, it was nominated for Album of the Year (grammies) and won best Alternative Album.  This time, Amnesiac will win it all, it is that good.  Radiohead far from being done.  They have yet to released their more beautiful songs which include &quot;Big Ideas&quot;, &quot;True Love Waits&quot;, &quot;Aligators in New York Sewers&quot; and many more.  Hopefully these songs will be on the next album.  Anyways, I strongly suggest that you buy this album because these types of great bands come every couple of decades or so.        Radiohead you are the best of the best!
B000059HB7|5.0|Director Howard Hawks made 1959's &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; because he refused to believe the citizens of a Western town would refuse to help their sheriff protect the town as happened in 1952's &quot;High Noon.&quot;  So when John Wayne's character of Sheriff John T. Chance needs help in Tucson, Arizona to keep the brother of the local bad guy in jail, he is able to whip up support in the form of his former deputy Dude (Dean Martin), just coming off a two-year bender, Stumpy (Walter Brennan), an ornery old cripple, and Colorado Ryan (Ricky Nelson), a young gunslinger.  To add a touch of elegance to the proceedings is Feathers (Angie Dickinson), who knows how to wield a razor and provides the Duke with a little bit of romance.  Even though the bad guys capture Dude so they can exchange him for the jailed man, Chance and his comrades are able to save the day, with a little help from some dynamite.<br />&quot;Rio Bravo&quot; is a significant western in movie history for two reasons.  First, this classic film marks the end of the psychological westerns such as &quot;High Noon&quot; and &quot;Shane&quot; which had dominated the 1950s.  The point of &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; was to provide entertainment and that it certainly does.  Second, it added elements of humor to John Wayne's on-screen persona for the first time.  For the rest of his career, most movies with the Duke will find his character having a humorous side (e.g., &quot;McClintlock&quot;).  As you can well imagine, there is some singing to be done in &quot;Rio Bravo.&quot;  Martin does the title tune, sings &quot;My Rifle, My Pony, and Me&quot; with Nelson, who in turn gets to sing Cindy with Brennan.  Wayne does not do any singing.  In 1967 Hawks and Wayne essentially remade &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; with their film &quot;Eldorado,&quot; with Robert Mitchum, Arthur Hunnicutt and James Caan providing the support.  While I consider it an enjoyable film, in does suffer in comparison to the original.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Radiohead is a band with a long history that covers many of the different &quot;genres&quot; and styles that have recently been prominant in todays western pop music. If you consider the drastic evolution from their earliest albums to the most recent, it is easy to see that creativity, change, and innovation have always been at the forefront of thier creative spark. Indeed these are key elements in any creative feild and the product that these key elements yeilds is one of immense artistic integrity. This newest album is certainly not an exception. Radiohead reamins to me one of the greatest bands of our time.
B00005B4GU|2.0|This album is pretty much a collection of throw-away tracks that deserve to be b-sides, with a few exceptions. Songs like &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot; will probably only appeal to those who enjoyed &quot;Fitter Happier&quot; off of OK Computer. For me, they're just songs I always skip over. Overall, this album feels less coherent and cohesive than either of their previous two. The saving graces of this album are the first single, &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; (a hauntingly beautiful song and video), and the tracks &quot;Knives Out&quot; and &quot;Dollars &amp; Cents&quot;. If only they would've thrown those 3 tracks on to Kid A, then it would've been the equal of the classic OK Computer. I'm mildly disappointed, but still glad to have a fresh set of tracks to digest.
B00005AQF7|5.0|I've owned this cd for a long time and i think you can keep playing the album it's a classic . The album is a lot better than his latest one and i'm looking foward to hearing another album that got's the sound from doggstyle! c ya
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Wow! And I do mean wow! I've seen this movie five times in theatres and two more since buying the DVD. I bought the CD right after seeing the movie the first time and, as others have said, it does not disappoint. And this from the purist who normally hates covers and remakes! The movie is fantastic (get it on DVD! The special features alone are incredible!) and my one complaint is that not all the music made it onto this CD (Smells like Teen Spirit, The Pitch and the musical score to be brief). I'm hoping Lurhmann comes out with another CD with more dialogue (I absolutely love Ewan and Kidman's Elephant Love Medley. His dialogue is so cute!) and more music. Beck is surprisingly good at doing David Bowie (different from the original, yes, but amazingly good!) and I actually like Christina Aguilara and co's version of the classic Lady Marmalade. Very strange. But good. Just order it already!
0345350472|5.0|THis is a great read. Different from the film, yet just as dark and interesting. I recommend it. I alos recomend anything by Harlan Ellison. Also try Wildflower, by Carl Rafala (if you can't get it here, try the Booksurge website.)
068484267X|4.0|Frank McCourt tells the poignant, touching story of his childhood in Ireland.  He was from a poor family and his father was a drunkard.  While he did not have an easy childhood, he never let go of the dream to make something better of himself and provide a better life for his mother.  McCourt's way of writing is exactly like he's telling a story and I had to get used to reading like I was listening to a storyteller.  It takes some getting used to, but once you do, you can practically hear his accent.
B00001SIES|5.0|Ok, so everyone thinks there too similar to Radiohead...why?Because Matt Bellamy has a voice full of emotion? Because they have piano parts? Because they use slow hypnotic melodies and then crash into a heavy, mind blowing chorus? Or is it because they're different and stand out in the crowd of unoriginal, unneeded music we here today? The latter I think, because they are a band that a making a revelotion in music, going against the waves. BUY THIS ALBUM...your missing wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy to much if you dont!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I love this music.  I listen to it all day and it doesn't seem to get old.  Ewan voice is so pure and untouched that is beautiful and Nicole's voice matches perfect with Ewan. I love it!!!!
B00005A1PR|5.0|I listen to this CD all day, everyday at work ... for days on end then find myself playing it at home as well.   Video and Brown Skin were my favorites at first.  Now,  I'm totally feeling  Strength Courage and Wisdom,  Back To The Middle,  Always in My Head ,  I See God In You, Simple,  Part of My Life, Wonderful ...  which is basically everything ... <br />The last CD I played so frequently was Macy Gray's debut.  This was Jill Scott's year and I love her sound too.  But India Arie will definitely be shining next year at the award programs ...
B000059ZLH|3.0|I rate the content:  5 stars.  I rate the technical aspects of the disc itself:  2 stars (read below).<br />I'm not going to write about how great Dream Theater is, or how great an album SfaM is...we all know know and agree on those points.  Instead I've got a few things to say about this substandard DVD.  I've got no complaints about the content...plenty of great stuff and great songs including an audio track by band members which is cool.  But tell my why someone wasted their time an effort putting analog VHS type media on a digital disc?  They really should have filmed the concert in widescreen (anamorphic) and created a cropped pan and scan version for the VHS version.  That way those of us with widescreen TVs could actually get some use out of owning digital equipment.  Instead we're treated to a disc that is simply a clearer version of the VHS version.  I was fully expecting DD 5.1.  Instead we get Pro Logic (2.0).  Ahhh....plain old stereo based on 60s technology.  Sure it's digital, but who give's a rats if 4 of my speakers aren't even being used?!!  Want to hear how a real DD 5.1 music DVD should sound?  Put in TOOLs Salival DVD that has all their videos.  OMG!  O...M...G!!  Shame on Dream Theater for allowing such a substandard piece of digital craftsmanship be released with their names on it.  SHAME!!!<br />If you're buying this disc just for the music an know nothing about DVDs and digital home theaters, you'll be in heaven.  If you're expecting all the bells and whistles that you think you're gonna get in a disc released in the year 2000 (!!!), you'll be pretty disappointed.  I feel like my home theater system is being wasted everytime I put this disc in.
B00005B4GU|5.0|It took a couple of sit downs with this CD to understand what's going on here.  Once you do, you won't stop listening to it. Hats off!
B00000DQWT|5.0|'The Falcon and the Snowman' was, frankly, a so-so film, but it was the inspiration for this gorgeous soundtrack.  I have the movie on DVD, and although the sound is crystal clear, it's unfortunately in mono.  The movie featured songs by many other artists -- such as Free's 'All Right Now' and the Doobie Brothers' 'China Grove' -- but this album focuses entirely on music performed and arranged by Metheny and Mays.  My copy of the CD simply uses a photo-reduction of the original LP sleeve, so the text is virtually unreadable.  But reading through the end credits on the DVD, the band personnel are Metheny, Mays, Rodby and Wertico.  There's no mention of another singing percussionist -- neither Aznar nor Vasconcelos are acknowledged to be on this album, although the chanting on 'The Falcon' sounds identical to Pedro's voice.<br />The album is a gem, although there are basically just two constantly recurring themes: the sublime 'Daulton Lee' and the chart-destined 'Chris'/'This is not America'.  Track #6, 'The Extent of the Lie', is another Metheny/Mays soundscape, of the type first tried out on the 'As Falls Wichita' album.<br />I remember seeing Metheny in interview at the time of the making of this soundtrack -- it was all recorded in England -- and this was at a time when Metheny and Mays were effectively the unofficial sales arm of New England Digital.  Metheny gave a superbly modest demonstration of the synclavier, using a keyboard rather than a guitar as the input vehicle.  It was fascinating to see the sheet music automatically generated from his doodlings.  Sounds simple now, but back in 1985 this was impressive!<br />The film features my ideal intelligence job: you lock yourself away where no-one can reach you, and you observe many of the top-secret activities going on around the globe.  If only it were better paid!<br />Ultimately this soundtrack is better than the movie, and I still think it's the best soundtrack the PMG has recorded.  I cannot help feeling that Metheny and Mays have at least a couple more monster soundtracks within them, if only they could work together on the project.that Metheny and Mays have at least a couple more monster soundtracks within them, if only they could work together on the project.
0345350472|5.0|&quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; is a brilliant sci-fi adventure through the streets and skies of futuristic society. Set in 2021, this is a story of Richard Deckard; &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, husband and just another person with the usual social ails.<br />A number of highly advanced androids have made a daring escape &quot;off-Earth&quot; and have come back to Earth to try and survive. Deackards job is to hunt these androids, who appear as much like humans as everyone else and neutralise them before they harm anyone.<br />Dicks ability and endless imagination drive you through the book, depicting the state that the world has become (the rare existance of live animals) and the demise of the rogue androids.<br />This was my first exposure to Dicks brilliance and I have since read &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot; and &quot;Planets of the Alphane Moon&quot;, which have both been excellent. If you enjoyed the movie adaptation, you will be thrilled with this books added detail and depth. Enjoy!
B00005B4GU|5.0|I listened to Radiohead in the &quot;reverse order&quot; so to speak, starting with Kid A, ending with Pablo Honey.  Pablo Honey is their only weak album, and quite frankly I hated it, but this isn't a review of Pablo Honey...<br />When I first got Kid A, it took me a lot of listens to even figure it out, I mean, I was exremely intrigued by this almost montrous recording, but I couldn't put my finger on exactly what made it work.  Maybe it was because I had virtually no previous experience with &lt;i&gt;Radiohead, Aphex Twin, or Boards of Canada &lt;/i&gt;,(PS, check out Boards of Canada, they are fantastic) but it took me a while to get into it.  <br />Amnesiac is an extremely difficult album to those who only previous experience in music are &lt;i&gt;Limp Bizkit&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;O-Town&lt;/i&gt;.  But to those who are music afficionados, and got all the obscure band references from &lt;i&gt; High Fidelity &lt;/i&gt;, this album is for you.  Although as all radiohead records need to played as a whole, here is a little review track by track.<br />1) Pakt like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box: Thom gives the impression of a paranoid, whithered old man, sulking into the corner of a dimly lit room, with his contant repeating of &quot;I'm a reasonable man/get off my case.&quot;  Not as of great of an opening track as &quot;Everything in it's right place&quot;, but still good.<br />2) Pyramid Song:  The album's first single and easily is seen why.  The most accessible track.  A constant repeating piano melody gives the sense of doom, while the strings make you feel like you are lost at sea.  Fantastic.<br />3) Pull/Pulk Revolving Doors: Scary to fall asleep to.  The random sputtering of the lyrics from what sounds like a broken down robot gives you the sense of falling through door after door until your death.  <br />4) You and Whose Army? One of my favorite tracks.  Thom's voice is utilized to the full extent, breathing life into the lyrics.  His voice is so frightened, so upset, it sounds like a scared, shaking individual who is shouting out random babbelings at unknown adversaries.  <br />5) I Might be Wrong:  Blues-y, sounds almost like a normal band!(wow!)  The kind-of-rock track on the record.<br />6) Knives out: Frightening Lyrics that suggest an unwarranted murder, without any mercy.  Imagine an insane person calling for an execution, and shouting to all his friends &quot;so...knives out!!!&quot; as they take them out of their pockets and go in for the kill.<br />7) Morning Bell/Amnesiac:  Same morning bell from Kid A, only with dissonant live instruments, like someone a thousand years in the future, who is extremely distraught, trying to cover the Kid a version.<br />8) Dollars and Cents: Another one of my favorite tracks:  The main character seems to have a beyond obsession with money, an almost evil love of it.  Thom shouts &quot;All of the dollars and cents&quot; repeatedly while on another vocal track, he mutters under his breath &quot;We are going to CRACK your little souls&quot;<br />9) Hunting Bears: instrumental, all guitars.  I haven't really gotten an image out of it, like I did with Treefingers.  Maybe it will just take more time.<br />10) Like Spinning Plates: My second favorite track.  a whirring techno sound makes me imagine the character in a dark futuristic city, with towers that have spinning plates on top, as the character jumps in the &quot;muddy river&quot; and tries to float away from this society he hates so much.  I personally think they perfect the whole soundscape idea on this song.<br />11) Life in a Glass House: My favorite track.  Uses aleatoric jazz elements  not unlike from &quot;The National Anthem.&quot;  Gives the impression that the paranoid/skitzophrenic character believes everyone can see through the walls of his house, as he hides his head in the corner of the damp basement, with his head exploding from all the images and thoughts contained in his brain.  His memory cannot take anymore.<br />Five Stars.
B00005B4GU|5.0|If I could give this album more than 5 stars I would have.  I have spent 2.5 days with Amnesiac now and I have still been unable to pick my jaw up off of the floor.  Amnesiac begins with a disembodied tribal beat and ends with the mournful sounds of a New Orleans funeral march.  This doesn't sound like your average rock album does it?  Well that is because Radiohead and their albums are anything but average.  In a world full of jock-rock, insipid teen-pop and derivitive rock it is a God-send to have Radiohead exploring new musical ground.   Stand out tracks include the somber and tremendously beautiful &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; , the hypnotic &quot;Packt Like Sardines...&quot; and the triumphant, jazz based &quot;Life in a Glasshouse.&quot;  But this does not mean that all the songs do not shine brightly, these songs just shine a bit brighter.  &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; begins with a lilting, Bill Evans like piano along with some distorted strings and climaxes (not an inappropriate term) in a flury of beautiful strings, trancy digital efects and Phil Seleway's jazz inspired drumming.  &quot;Packt...&quot; is a menagare of drum and bass and Thom Yorke seemingly at the end of his rope with the &quot;rock-star&quot; life (so called) and the pressures that go along with it.  Listen to &quot;Packt...&quot; on a good system and prepare to be amazed.  But truth be told the star of this disc is the closing track &quot;Life in a Glasshouse.&quot;  After hearing a ten track five-piece guitar band masterpiece I reached &quot;Life...&quot; and was completely blown away.  The question has to be:  How many genres of music can Radiohead master?  The song is Dixieland Jazz for Heaven's sake!      Amnesiac is not merely a good album, it is instead a masterpiece of modern music.  Radiohead are the Bach, Mahler, Coltrane, Miles, Beatles, etc. of our generation.  The airwaves are full of music that is nothing more than manufactured fodder for listerers that have been desensitised by mindless music.  But Radiohead is having none of that, they are in the business of creating art, not merely making money.
B00003CXB2|5.0|Movie Summary:  British officer T.E. Lawrence is balmy. He is sent out to be a military observer to Prince Feisal of Arabia in World War 1 and ends up leading the Arab revolt against the Turks. He does the impossible a few times along the way by uniting the warring Arab tribes and taking Aqaba. In the end he becomes a legend.<br />My Opinion:  Both the movie and the DVD are 5 stars. The story is so engaging that it was over far faster than it's 227 minutes would suggest. This is a movie that passes the test of time. It is a wonderful work of art. <br />DVD Quality:  This is an awesome two DVD set. It's wide screen anamorphic with a remastered Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack. There are way too many extras to list. <br />What You Should Do:  Buy this DVD. Rent it first if you have doubts, but you will not regret buying it. This is what DVD was meant to be.
B00003CXRM|4.0|While I personally do not understand people who give this film five stars, as it does NOT rank up there with the landmark films of all time- I completely and thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and plan to make it part of my DVD collection soon after its release on the format. As someone who typically finds George Clooney wooden and annoying, I found his performance in O Brother to be absolutely hilarious, and the supporting cast was in perfect harmony throughout the laconic romp through the Great Depression Era South . The music is simply phenomenal- I knew (and still know) next to nothing about traditional country/blue grass/spiritual music, but the cross section of truly fitting music in O Brother has me curious- I bought the album a couple of days after its release. All in all, O Brother was a great movie, and while it wasn't Casablanca or China Town it can more than hold its own against most of the schlock that you'll typically pay eight bucks for.
B00003CXHJ|5.0|One of my top five all times favorite movies, U-571 ROCKS on DVD. The bonus features are a little lacking for a &quot;Collecter's Edition&quot;, but they are very informative and intersting.  The best part of this movie is by far the sound.  In the depth charge sequences, the sound will rock your house.  This is best sounding DVD and should have won many Oscars, especially Best Sound (though the movie did win the Oscar for Best Sound Editing).
0141301155|5.0|This Roald Dahl book is merely his second major published work for children. Despite this, he manages to show the world that he has the skills necessary for writing children's books after a successful stint as an adult writer. The book is a delight from first to last, and is a real page-turner with twists and turns on every page. In addition, the pace and excitement are well-maintained and a keen sense of cohesion deeply felt.<br />The story begins quite slowly and normally in introducing our hero Charlie, but it picks up a little earn about Wonka's chocolate factory, and meet the interesting, winsome and informative Grandpa Joe. It is when the Golden Tickets are announced then we are in for a real surprise. We end up rooting for Charlie to find one, following him on his adventures, and letting the unexpected surprises in the factory enthrall us as much as Charlie did. At the same time, we end up laughing at the four naughty children who find the other Golden Tickets, yet learn the vices of good behaviour at the same time. The results are often hilariously funny, and their exploits act as a kind of cautionary tale that shows the children's love of sweet things at the same time as they possess their youthful heart.<br />Overall, this is a wonderfully written book that serves as one of the best introductions to Dahl's children's writing. It is still an enjoyable read for me despite the fact that I am still a teenager, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is starting to read.
B00005JSGK|4.0|&quot;Hatari&quot; is the film of my childhood.  I grew up as a Marine's kid in the late 50's through the 60's, living primarily at Cherry Point USMC airbase (Havelock) NC. The town was so small then that we had to go to the base cinema which would, of course, show every John Wayne movie over and over again.  This was the only one I would ask to go see.  Violence and &quot;ugly Americanism&quot; are at a minimum for a JW movie. However, since the live capture of wild animals can be pretty intense, I wouldn't recommend it for pre-schoolers or very sensitive children.  I gave it 4 stars because there is minimal technical information and I want to see the quality of the DVD transfer before I commit.  This is definitely worth a rental.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|As far as the bizarre and strange musical goes, Moulin Rouge ranks as king.   Not even Rocky Horror could be stranger than much of Moulin Rouge.   And that's one of the reasons why I loved the movie.<br />But why only 4 stars?   Some of the best songs are missing.   For one thing, the Sound of Music is nowhere to be found.   Likewise, the Lady Marmalade/Smells Like Teen Spirit is absent, even though it is far more superior than the version that is on the soundtrack.   Not to mention the most hillarious version of Like of Virgin ever performed.   And then there was that song sung to the tune of the Can Can....<br />So, another soundtrack is desperately needed.   Especially since Ozzy Osbourne, one who was slated to be on this soundtrack, is mysteriosly absent.   But for now, I guess I'll just hope this one will have that much needed sequel album.<br />Album would've gotten a full 5 stars if it did have the songs that showed the wackiness of the film the most.
B00000IGGA|2.0|That's what it sounds like to me. With the exceptions of &quot;Cold Water,&quot; &quot;Filipino Box Spring Hog,&quot; and &quot;Come on up to the House,&quot; there's not much of interest here. Contrast this album with his great stuff (from Swordfishtrombones to Bone Machine) - it just doesn't match up. The ballads especially, while pretty, are boring and cause no emotional response (unlike his good ballads like &quot;A Little Rain&quot; from Bone Machine). Somehow I knew this album was not that good, which is why I held off buying it for over a year. Tom's stint as America's premier original musical genius might be done. Or maybe he can still turn it around, as there's still a couple of brilliant songs here.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Im not going to sit here and explain everything, just buy the cd, every second of it is good.
1878424114|3.0|Go ahead and read it, it won't take much time (its very short).<br />I read this after reading Wayne Dyer's &quot;Manifest Your Destiny&quot;.  They are almost identical but Dyer's book elaborates a bit more. I liked them both and feel like the &quot;Laws&quot; are very much in keeping with the Bible and the Christian teachings that I've grown up with.  Both of these books are like the Reader's Digest Condensed Version of the golden rule.  Everybody needs to be reminded of it now and then.
B000000JO3|3.0|Fugazi was a good band from DC.All you people on this [page fawning w/idolatry need ta get a life.In NO way were Fugazi in the realm of the Sex Pistols,Iggy,Dead boys,Johnny Thunders et al.And please,STRAIGHT EDGE?!?! I live in DC!!!I had to deal w/ all that preachy crap.Now,don't get me wrong Fugazi is one of the best bands outta DC...But damn they don't touch the Badbrains!!!So put this in context...I give 'em 3 ta 3 and a half stars.A good band made better simply because DCs' always been a graveyard scene for music.Peace out y'all!
B0000033TE|5.0|If you are looking for music to awaken your brain to think and listen and just kick back and enjoy the high-technology sounds of ELP in this great album.   The absolute highlight track of this one is Toccata, based on a piano concerto by Argentine composer Ginastera.   The rhythmic drive and intensity of the composition will take your brain on to a new dimention of life.  Great tune.
B00005IBGQ|5.0|I am as giddy as a school-boy when I talk about this cd! Rufus Wainwright is definately a man with a knack for melody, song structure, and lyrics (oh yeah, and he's really cute, too). Along with Radiohead's &quot;Amnesiac&quot; and Lucinda Williams' &quot;Essence&quot;, this was one of the &quot;must-have&quot; cd's that I bought on June 5. While the other two cds are surely a couple of the greatest releases thus far this year, Rufus' &quot;Poses&quot; takes the title. I never knew that music could be this beautiful, fun, moving, sad, upbeat, classic, and emotional all at once! His debut, self-titled cd was a masterpiece in its own right, but this cd really shows his growth as an artist. Gone is all of the baroque trappings of his first cd (beautiful as they were, sometimes you longed for something a bit modern after consistent listenings), and here are ringing guitar noises, electronic effects, gorgeous piano playing, and THAT VOICE! How can you not love that voice? Rufus is (in my opinion) like Burt Bacharach, Tori Amos, Elton John, Cole Porter, Kate Bush, Van Dyke Parks, and Randy Newman all rolled into one, beautiful, talented young man. <br />&quot;Shadows&quot; is a song that relies on a funky, almost danceable backbeat with a swooning melody. &quot;Evil Angel&quot; is like a flood of sound sweeping over you. All ominous orchestrations to begin with, then bombastic elctronic pulses blow you away, all while Rufus croons softly with his sister in the wake. &quot;Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk&quot; is a fun little ditty about his vices. &quot;One Man Guy&quot; (written by his father) is beautiful and funny. It's a song about the beauty of solitude. &quot;California&quot; is a catchy, satirical song about the Golden Gate State. Great guitar work, too. Would sit nicely next to Rany Newman's &quot;I Love LA&quot;. And then there is &quot;Poses&quot;. This song defies discription. You really have to hear it to understand it. What a gorgeous melody and heart wrenchinglyrics. All about the lonliness and emptiness you feel when you have everything. <br />I highly recommend buying this cd ASAP! Rufus will restore your faith in music. Don't forget to see him live this summer on the Wotapalava tour!
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I was anxious to say the least upon seeing Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge. Based on the trailers, it looked to be a really spectacular film, but, as I sat watching the beginning of the movie, I quickly became aware that I was not really prepared for the vision that was about to unfold. <br />Moulin Rouge is nothing short of dazzling, a wild-eyed, acid trip on steroids, that looks and sounds like nothing you've ever seen before. The first 45 minutes of this reinvented musical are a dizzying blur that will leave you gasping for air, as you are grabbed up by the seat of your pants and hurled through a cartoon, cardboard cutout of Paris, circa 1900. It is garish, bawdy, and beautiful, kind of like riding a terrifying thrill, going 100 miles per hour, and the minute it's over you want to run to get back in line, to ride it again.<br />This is a classic opera tale that centers around the characters Christian, a penniless writer, played with class and style by Ewan McGregor, and Satine, the beautiful star, and courtesan of the fabled Moulin Rouge played by gorgeous Nicole Kidman. The incredible scenes between them literally light up the screen with love and excitement. They sing... they dance and they do both damn well! It's pure joy watching these two beauties cavort across the starlit sky, singing with the moon of their secret love.<br />Moulin Rouge features some great contemporary songs by a host of familiar composers and singers, all rendered into some of the most eye-popping musical production numbers put on film since the 1940's. Look for Oscars for the imaginative sets, the lavish costumes and mind-boggling special effects. I also think we'll see &quot;Secret Song&quot; nominated for best song as well. The entire supporting cast-of-characters, add just the right bent to round out this lopsided kaleidoscope of a movie. <br />I have seen a lot of films in my life, some great, some not so great, but I don't believe I have ever seen one that has affected me in such an oddway. Moulin Rouge has broken the mould of the tired, old movie musical and given it vibrant a new life, and quite frankly, that's a very good thing! <br />I plan on seeing this one again, and again, I hope you do so too!
B00003W8NM|5.0|I rented this movie because it was a friends favorite movie.  I watched it and i loved it.  It isn't at all like i had expected. Its really thought provoking, and i feel like it has really changed my life, so to speak.  The day after I saw it, I had to get it, now I'm writing this reveiw so that maybe i'll convince sombody else to see it.
B00003CWOL|5.0|This movie has enough content to satisfy viewers through a good dozen viewings. The acting is delightful and Linda Fiorentino delivers with her bewildered cynicism and subtle spot-on facial expressions. Alanis Morissette plays God with wit and grace. Fun fun cinema.
B000005ALN|1.0|What happened to that full, rich voice that landed him at the top of the charts with Faith, One More Try, Father Figure, etc?  What happened to the creative spirit that, while it wasn't a commercial success, made Listen Without Prejudice Volume I a CD worth listening to over and over?<br />I've been there for ya, George.  Did my time with you during the WHAM! years, waited patiently for your first solo album, enjoyed &quot;I want your Sex&quot; in the interim, screamed myself hoarse in '88 at your live show -- and now *this* is what you come up with?  You're better than that, but the work is aptly titled, at least.
0684867184|5.0|Many authors have picked up on the fact that men need coaching on how to converse with and relate to women.  Stephen Ambrose has done a fine service in opening up the need for men to pay more attention to how they relate to other men.  Using a combination of historical and personal examples, men will find this book a beacon to guide them towards new kinds of fulfillment.  Women will learn to appreciate more of the benefits of encouraging fathers, husbands, and sons to have closer ties with other males.<br />One of the benefits that I got from this book was that it filled me in on relationships that I have never had and won't have.  For example, I don't have a brother.  I could tell from seeing how my father related to his brothers that this was something special, but could never quite get inside of it.  Now I understand the relationship much better from hearing what Professor Ambrose has to say about his brothers.  I also never served in the military (4F was my draft status), and did not have that experience.  From my father's faithful attendance at military reunions with his World War II unit mates over the years, I could also tell that this was special for him.  I also understand this relationship a little better now.  I appreciate both of those gifts.<br />Professor Ambrose also points out the potential downsides of these relationships.  Custer's unbridled ambition and ego led his two brothers to their deaths at an untimely age.  Professor Ambrose's father was stern and strict until late in his life, making his sons feel downtrodden.  Milton Eisenhower tried to talk his brother Dwight out of running for a second term, thinking it might kill him.<br />Three other stories were especially rewarding for me.  The first was how Professor Ambrose's father developed an interest in American history and helped Professor Ambrose become a fine historian, after having insisted he become a medical doctor earlier.  This encouraged me to want to learn more about my sons' professions, both of which I know relatively little about now.<br />The second was the very close connection that some World War II foes on D-Day developed in the post-war period.  It made me think that I should seek out people with whom I may have once felt competitive, and become better acquainted.<br />The third related to close ties with students.  This made me want to do more teaching than I do now, so that I can develop more cross-generational male friendships.  That was something that had never occurred to me.<br />Comrades is not a history book in the classic sense.  It is also not a how-to book.  Instead, it reflects a sort of oral tradition that will spark emotions and desires in you that you didn't know you had.  That's a great benefit to receive from a book.<br />By the way, I suspect that students of management could learn a lot from the example of Lewis and Clark that is described here.<br />After you finish this book, do take a little time to think about which variations on these themes you would like to weave more strongly into your life.

B00005BL2A|4.0|What is up with all the one and two star bash-sessions?? Some people just can't be pleased. For everyone who is still living in the past and thinks it's the late 80's, I propose that even Depeche Mode has to grow up some time. Perhaps maybe some of you should do the same? To expect DM to keep churning out fluffy radio-friendly diddies ala 80's is just going to lead to eternal heartbreak. Come on, gang, we've got to let the band expand and mature beyond what they were on the last album, or the album before that, or the album before that, etc.<br />Through three albums now, SOFAD, Ultra, and especially Exciter, we've seen Depeche Mode do some Olympic-level stretching, and it's refreshing! Exciter is especially different, with nary a radio-buzz-clip-worthy fluff song on it. And in this day and age where it seems fluff in pop music is at an all time high (Destiny's Child? N'Sync?? Spears??? GAG! COUGH! PUKE!!) I applaud DM for wanting to take the high road and avoid the easy way out. DM has known fully well how much wrath they risk when they experiment, but why do we think they've been around for 20+ years??? Because they EVOLVE!<br />Well, my hat is off to another step in the EVOLUTION of that wonderful musical experience that is Depeche Mode. They've been doing it better &amp; different than just about anyone for two decades now, and they don't appear to be ready to stop. The extra long pause between Ultra and Exciter had me a tad worried, I will admit, but it's been worth it. Exciter is pure ear candy, if only you'll stop looking at the album through Violator or MFTM colored eyes. This is DM2K all the way, and I like it!! All three band members are to be commended.
0671578855|5.0|To fully appreciate this book, it helps to have read Miles's previous adventure, &quot;Komarr&quot;, which ends just about exactly where this one picks up.  However, Ms Bujold does include enough backstory in this volume to get by on.<br />The author's dedication includes several ladies listed only by first names -- among them &quot;Jane&quot; (Austen) and &quot;Georgette&quot; (Heyer).  Certainly, the ladies' spirits are hovering close ocer this story, because it is a thoroughly enjoyable Comedy Of Manners from start to finish.<br />Part of the fun, though one tends to cringe as one looks ahead, is in watching the step by step manner in which Miles Vorkosigan, the resourceful former covert ops whiz and youngest Imperial Auditor, who *always* comes out ahead no matter how hopeless the situation, meticulously setting up an inevitable Hideous Flaming Social Disaster for himself.  Only the truly brilliant can be truly stupid when they Miss The Point and push on, anyway, and Miles is beyond brilliant.<br />Miles, you see, has Fallen In Love.  For real and for permanent, this time, it looks like.  And he has no clue at all as to how normal people connect up and pair off in the Real World.<br />Of course, he has helpers, partners and accomplices in setting up his own humiliation -- his clone-brother Mark arrives with a true Mad Scientist in tow and sets up a lab in Miles's basement.<br />Three beautiful sisters with conflicting motives and plans for various of the male characters help to stir the brew.<br />And then there are the butter bugs... but we won't talk about the butter bugs here, except that they are Rather Important to the plot.<br />&quot;Mother, Father, I'd like you to meet... She's getting *away*!&quot;<br />If you enjoy a romp through society's ins and outs; if you have enjoyed Georgette Heyer's wonderful Regency romances, then you must try this book.<br />And if you like it as well as i think you will, and decide you *must* know more about Miles and his family and Barrayar, then either jump *all* the way back to &quot;Cordelia's Honor&quot;, which is the two novels that are earliest in series order (&quot;Shards of Honor&quot; and &quot;Barrayar&quot;), or you might want to jump back to &quot;The Warrior's Apprentice&quot;, which is the beginning of Miles's adventures.<br />Or you might just want to pick up any of the series and enjoy yourself.family and Barrayar, then either jump *all* the way back to &quot;Cordelia's Honor&quot;, which is the two novels that are earliest in series order (&quot;Shards of Honor&quot; and &quot;Barrayar&quot;), or you might want to jump back to &quot;The Warrior's Apprentice&quot;, which is the beginning of Miles's adventures.<br />Or you might just want to pick up any of the series and enjoy yourself.
0152023984|1.0|I was highly disappointed with the new translation of The Little Prince.  After reading the first page alone, I knew I would be shaking my head throughout.  The poetic beauty Katherine Woods extracted from the original French version is missing completely from this new version.  Had I never read the Woods version, I would say that this is a good book, but not really a great one.  However, since I have read the original, I must say the new one is simply too mundane and easy to read.  It's a watered down version of a literary masterpiece.  <br />As an elementary school teacher I buy a copy of The Little Prince every June for each of my students as a gift.  We read the book together, and we embark on a journey to uncover the mysteries of the universe through the adventures of the interplanetary traveler.  It is a fitting way to end a school year.  My students love the original language, and they love to construct personal meaning from the text.  We have some wonderful discussions about the language and the meaning of the words.  Part of the beauty of The Little Prince is pausing momentarily while reading to absorb meaning.  I'm afraid the new version leaves very little to the imagination, and leaves little room for juicy conversation.<br />I hope the publisher will continue to publish Woods version, or else I'll have to find another book to give to my students at the year's end.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Terrific acting, awesome action, impressive cinematography, hauntingly beautiful music, and perfect casting. What more could you ask for in a movie? Nada. I rank this movie among the greatest epic movies ever made such as Ben-Hur, Papillon, and Braveheart.

0553269631|3.0|This novel is mostly based on four characters and their relationship with John Singer.  Singer is a deaf mute who lives in a small Georgia town in the late 30s.  The book generally focuses on these characters' flaws and desires.  These characters are very lonely, and they seek out Singer because they believe that he's a safe character to tell their deepest, darkest, secrets to.  However, Singer, as he listens to these people, feels inside himself a deep loneliness.  He feels that he has nowhere to turn, so he silently just sits and politely reads the lips of his acquantances.<br />My favorite character in this novel was Mick Kelly.  She is a young girl of 14 who had many dreams and aspirations. Her mind constantly struggled with the concept of how to make her dreams a reality.  Her pure desire moved me tremendously.<br />I was disappointed with the book as a whole.  While, I enjoyed many aspects of the book, like the character development, I was disappointed with how most of the characters were pretty much left in limbo in the end.  I felt that there was no conclusion of problems or revelations.  It left me feeling incomplete.
B00004XQP4|5.0|I've been a Green Day fan since 94 and I've loved all of their stuff so far. However, I like lots of other forms of rock besides punk and am happy to see that Green Day is changing their sound a bit. Although it is awsome, if they kept their same sound that they had on Dookie, Insomniac, and most of Nimrod, it would get old after a while. At least for me. There are some great songs on Warning that have an all-new sound that don't make me feel like I've heard the same song before with different lyrics. \\"Waiting\\" is one of the best new songs I've heard in a really long time. Billie Joe seems to have moved on to a more mature stage in his life because it reflects in the lyrics, which are now about sacrifice and relationships instead of [self gratification] and matters that don't seem to pertain to Bilie Joe's actaul life. I hope Green Day continues to be more diverse with their music on their next cd, but it would also be nice if they could have a few songs that remind the long time fans of Dookie and Insomniac. If you are a long time Green Day fan you should get this album unless you didn't like songs from Nimrod like Good Riddance. If you haven't really been into Green Day, have just listened to theirsongs on the radio, or only have one cd, you should give it a listen before you buy. And if you are a punk fan, and don't especially like Green Day, you may want to pass.
B000002U82|3.0|Money and Time are great tracks and fully account for the three stars in my rating.  The rest is pure pretentious drivel.
B000007MVX|5.0|This is one of those albums that took me a few listens before I became a fan.  Now it finds its way onto my player often.  This is one of Ian Anderson's most complex and interesting works.  However, it requires \\"active\\" listening and is not designed for use as background music at parties.  I have found it needs time to grow on you as with each play I perceive new themes and ideas.  I am a great fan of Tull and believe that the criticism from \\"reviewers\\" was totally unfounded.  Take your time a savor.  Thanks

0930289455|5.0|Many super-heroes came and went through the years, but not one had the staying power that Batman had. Of course, Superman started his career earlier than Batman, and remains the symbol of the super-hero genre; but while in the 80s and 90s Superman gradually became boring and repetitive, Batman reached his peak in the late 80s. Since his first appearence in 1939 Batman constantly changed, taking different forms every decade, and thus in the 80s, the Renaissance of comics, the flexibility of his character enabled every author to make his own Batman. Some of the best and most revolutionary writers and artists in comic art worked with Batman, each giving him something different.<br />The thing that made Batman so flexible and changable, in my opinion, is the very fact that he and his enemies lack super-powers. Both Batman and his foes are defined not by their powers, their physical strenght or their weapons, but by their personalities, by their MOTIVES. The Joker or Two Face, being purely head cases, are to me far more interesting than any enemy Superman or the Green Lantern ever had; and Batman's own imperfectness and problematic character make him far more interesting than those &quot;super-heroes&quot;.<br />In the late 80s the writers who worked on Batman started studying these subjects more than ever. One of the most fascinating things they realized, is how very similiar - in some ways, at least - Batman was to his enemies. Many works from that period worked on that thin line between Batman's good-guy obsession and his enemies bad-guy insanity, and the unusual relationship between them; most notably Morrison's 'Arkham Asylum', Delano's 'Manbat' and later Alan's Grant 'The Last Arkham'.<br />Alan Moore, one of the greatest minds in comic book and graphic novel writing, took that idea to its limits. In all of Moore's works, he played on very similiar ideas - basically, the idea of good and evil. Unlike other great writers like Neil Gaiman and Grant Morrison, Moore makes a point of using very traditional, very mainstream comic book ideas but using them in a very ironic, very criticizing way, exploring the problematic ideas of good-guys and bad-guys. The best example is, of course, 'Watchmen', in which he took the idea of the super-hero to disturbing new places, but his ideas also show in his conception of Jack the Ripper in 'From Hell' and in his approach to the unusual character of the Swamp Thing.<br />In 'The Killing Joke' Moore studied the characters of Batman and the Joker in an unusual way, which is very disturbing to old bat-fans who are used to the good Batman and the bad Joker. The Killing Joke is a disturbing work indeed, a graphic novel which draws you into it like few others do - especially if you read a lot of earlier Batman stories. Reading it you'll be shocked to find yourself undestanding, even feeling pity for the Joker, not long after he crippled Barbara Gordon, than took pictures of her naked and showed them to her father ( No, it's NOT a book for children. )Strangely and ironically, it presents the Joker more human than ever, and re-defines his personality, his story and the unusual relationship between him and the Batman.<br />The Killing Joke is a graphic novel, meaning that it stands all by itself as a complete work. It needs no introduction, and it doesn't really matter where it fits in with Batman's history ( well, except for the Barbara Gordon thing ). From the cover to the back cover, it is one perfectly combined masterpiece, complete with beautiful artwork by the excellent Brian Bolland. Along with Miller's 'Dark Knight Returns' and Morrison's 'Arkham Asylum', The Killing Joke is the most brilliant, most ingenious Batman stories ever written, if not one of the best comic books ever made.
B000002G26|4.0|...he's got a great rock voice.  Sure, he's no Bob Dylan with the lyrics, and even the titles and riffs are cliched, but power pop doesn't need to be rocket science.  It never did.<br />So this album compiles his greatest hits up till that point, mostly tunes from 'Reckless', the title cut of 'Cuts Like a Knife', and of course, 'Everything I Do' (which, while overplayed beyond belief still remains a guilty pleasure).  'Please Forgive Me' is merely average, but Adams manages to put enough conviction forth to sell it properly.<br />Since this album they've already put out another compilation, so it may not be worth your while to pick this up.  Dock one star, however, for offering fans the option of buying the liner notes for this album at [an amount] ON TOP of the cost of the CD...
B00005B4GU|5.0|This is the best CD I've ever listened to.... seriously.  I'm not a massive radiohead fan but i think im about to be.  every song is so cool in its own way.  i own kid a and ok computer and i think those are great but this is awesome.  first of all dont get the regular edition get the special edition.  The last song on the CD is possibly the best song i've ever heard (yet it gets no credit!), i listened to this cd 12 times in a row this afternoon.  this is probibly the worst review ever because i cant really explain myself well but i think everyone should buy this cd because it is the most real music to come out ever.  if you dont buy this after reading this review you will forever regret it.  THIS IS THE BEST CD OF ALL TIME.  IM NOT KIDDING.  BUY IT NOW AND SEE.  GET IT! GET IT! GET IT! YOU HAVENT GOTTEN IT YET! OR YOURE NOT LISTENING TO IT I BET! GO CLICK PUT IN SHOPPING CART AND BUY THIS CD NOW! STOP READING THIS REVIEW AND BUY IT! I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO STOP READING THIS! BUY AMNESIAC AND TOUCH GOD!!!!
0790729393|3.0|Truth be told, I did like this film, as big-budgeted and as calculating (towards Academy voters) as it might have been.  The performances all around are fantastic, with the exception of Brad Pitt, who's decent, but doesn't have much to sink his teeth into.<br />The biggest problem with this film is that a much lower-budget Canadian film called 'The Boys of St. Vincent' was released the previous year or so, and it's vastly superior, not to mention truly controversial.  Because there's some question as to how much of 'Sleepers' is based on truth, the film suffers; the actors seem as though they'd be more convincing if THEY themselves were convinced of the veracity of the script.<br />But it's quite enjoyable to watch, and more than worth a rainy-day rental.  Kevin Bacon especially should have at least received a supporting cast oscar, as a truly slimy prison guard.
B0000584V3|5.0|This is truly and amazing CD. This band jumps from speedy metal riffs and growling death vocals into acoustic melodies complete with clean vocals. At first I would get pissed off because the song would so frequently change from really heavy to totally mellow. After a while I realized how well it fit together. The  end of the song \\"Funeral Portrait\\" is amazing. The guitars intertwine to create a beautiful yet heavy harmony. I've listened to this CD over and over and every time I listen to it it seems to get better. The songs sound as though they must have been practiced hundreds of times but Mikael Akerfeldt says the band only practiced three times before they recorded. This is a fantastic CD and I cannot stress the greatness of it enough. Although I usually tend to listen to music more on the Death/Black metal side, \\"Blackwater Park\\" never lets me down. I don't think I'll ever get tired of hearing it.
B00005B36H|4.0|Nice CD package with off the wall artwork... although if you have other Tool albums, somehow in a strange & freakish way, this \\"Lateralus\\" artwork will somehow seem almost normal. I like history, lyrics, song credits, instruments being played, guest artist info and such - for the most part, you won't find any of that helpful info here. How do you classify this...? Hard rock & metal... yes; progressive, yes; artsy, yes. It's all over the place - that's what I like about this CD. I like the complexity, the varied tempo's, the loud guitars, the progressive stylings dating back to Yes & King Crimson and other early bands like that of the era. MJ Keenan continues to push his bandmate's balls to the wall with experimentation. Sure, it would have been very easy to put out the same kind of music as was on Aenima, or even Undertow... but the great bands choose a path less traveled - the path of diversity. While Adam Jones shines on this album, I often times think his role is frequently too loud. Jones often times takes over the song and Keenan, Carey (drums) and Chancellor (bass) are often pushed to the side. This is a difficult listen. My first spin evoked very little emotion out of me. It took me several spins just to get a feel for this album. It took about a dozen spins for me to pick my favorite songs (The Patient\\", \\"Parabol\\" & \\"Parabola\\" and \\"Ticks & Leeches\\". If your a fan of the band... pick this CD up. I would recommend going into it without any expectations (if possible). Know that it's TOOL, but know that it isn't the TOOL you've come to expect (4.5 stars).
0440219078|5.0|At first when i had to read The Giver for my english class, I was &quot;This will be boring!&quot;. When I came back from school, I started reading...and i couldn't stop! This is a unique story, the people are all the same. They live in a world with no music, or color or differences or true love. They take a pill to make them act like robots. The community gives them a job and a spouse and a family. They get their jobs at the 12th year. There is peace, but they don't have almost any feelings! Jonas is choosed to be the Receiver.  He will have all the memories of The Giver. He will have all the memories of the old times (colors, love, pain, loneliness, hapiness...), so he can be the wiseman of the community, he will make the best decisions for the peace of the community. But only one person cannot handle all these feelings and he feels apart from the others, he feels he can't fit in anymore, like when he was still a child. He grows too old for a kid of his age and the other kids don't understand him. Then he learns the end of every person released in to the &quot;Community's Elsewhere&quot;. But he decides to control his own future. With the help of the Giver, he discovers that there is a different &quot;elsewhere&quot; for everyone, some place beyond the community, where the past, the present and the future are. This is a wonderful book, that made me smile and cry. I will never forget this book, who has strong feelings to communicate to the reader. I stopped reading sometimes, for a minute, and look around me, enjoy the colors, the music and the happiness of be free of my own feelings. This book is one of the best books I have ever read, i really love this book and I think everyone should read it.
0385335482|5.0|This book tops Bridget Jones. Rebecca takes justification of her spending to a new level. The best parts of the book are the letters she gets from the bank and credit card companies. Even if we don't shop like Rebecca what makes this book fun is that all of us can relate to this character on some level. I read this over a weekend and didn't want it to end. I want more from this author.
B000007T1M|4.0|I'm not usually a great fan ofmetal.  It's not usually my scene which would explain the lack of that last star.  <br />It did take me a while to get used to this album, but I must say, the more and more I commited myself to this foreign, weird bunch of glorious musicians, the more I liked it.  <br />The mood of the album varies after almost every track, ranging from the light-headed, slow mood of &quot;Spiders&quot;, to the ultimate drunkard's &quot;Sugar&quot;.<br />My love for this LP is neverending and with any luck, the next one will be just as good.
B0000087QO|5.0|I was in college when this album came out.  The first cut I heard was Heart of Glass on  a car radio.  It was a warm day and a friend was driving.  We had just sat through hours of anatomy lectures.  I was struck not by the words but by the detached irony of Debbie Harry's voice.  It pulled me right in.  That's how I felt.  It was 1978 and the entire country was feeling blah. You know- stagflation, jimmy carter etc... I bought the cassette, smoked some dope and drove around with the top down.  The album was a hopeful sign that things could change.  The cinematic equivalent of Parallel Lines  for me is Robert Altman's Nashville which came out 3 years earlier.  The themes are the same.  Twenty three years later I still listen to this album and the next 2-Eat to the Beat and Autoamerica.  Listen to Bjork, Madonna, Hole and you can hear the echoes of Blondie.
B000005H7D|5.0|Everybody talks about Kind Of Blue as the Jazz CD essential.  That may be so,but it was Blue Train that got me hooked into jazz and made me a big Trane fan.  I first bought it in a cassette because it was on sale and I kind of liked the cover.  When I popped in the tape and heard Blue Train come out,it just blew me away.  I never get tired of listening to this CD.  In fact,I listen to this one more than I listen to Kind of Blue.  If you ever want to listen to the Trane for the first time,get this CD first.  It is just too sweet.
B00004W56S|5.0|This very Mike Rutherford album shows us the talents of a young musician, who is left behind the shadows of Peter Gabriel, Phil Collins, Stevie Hackett and Anthony Banks; the real makers of Genesis. Bass player Mike could not really interpret what he had in mind: beautiful melodies and Genesis-cut arrangement abilities. This is a perfect example of what he wanted to do. Pianos, keyboards, guitars (Hackett's tone, I have to admit, bass and unfortunately electronic drum set (in some pieces like Out Into the Daylight and &quot;wonderful&quot; Time and time again) are played skillfully. It completes the matrix of real Genesis, so buy it! You won't regret.. Much better than any Mike and the Mechanics' tracks!
B00005B4GU|4.0|Radioheads new album &quot;Amnesiac&quot; was said to be a more &quot;commercial&quot; album, and easier to get into than KID A.. I don't think it's an easier album to get into than KID A. But this isn't bad though. There are lots of a great tunes on Amnesiac. It opens with &quot;Packt like sardines in a crushd tin box&quot;, a catchy, very trip-hope stylish song with an angry Thom Yorke screaming out his anger &quot;I'm a reasonable man, get off my case&quot;! &quot;Pyramid song&quot; and &quot;You and whose army&quot; are other songs that proves that Radiohead still can make beautiful songs. &quot;Pulk/ Revolving doors&quot; and &quot;Like spinning plates&quot; are songs that reminds a lot of the songs KID A. Hardcore trip-hop with more rhytm than lyrics. It's very experimental, maybe a bit too much &quot;techno-alike&quot;.  Still Amnesiac is a great album.  The rocky &quot;I might be wrong&quot; might be the best track on the album and &quot;Knives Out&quot; reminds me of the good old Radiohead with gently guitars and drums. It's as Kid A still very dark, but Amnesiac is an album more real songs and lyrics which in my opinion makes it a better album than Kid A. Still &quot;Ok Computer&quot; is their absolute masterpiece but surely Amnesiac will be a classic.
0385335482|3.0|Well many of us have, and that is what makes this a fun and quick read. I know I used to have mail that went unopened because I didn't want to face the bitter truth inside! This is what the main character, Rebecca, goes through on a daily basis. Yeah, she is in major denial, but that's what your 20s are for - learning. Although I enjoyed the book, I only give it 3 stars because I was a bit let down by the ending. However, if you want a pleasant and funny beach-read, this is the perfect choice. However, after reading some of it, you may be possessed to hit the mall, instead!
6303039456|5.0|John Candy stars in a semi-dramatic role as Irv Blitzer, coach of the Jamaican Bobsled Team in &quot;Cool Runnings&quot;. Doug E. Doug and Malik Yoba offer fine supporting roles as well, as Blitzer's hard to teach pupils about the complex winter sport of bobsledding. In order to pull this feat off, an at first reluctant Coach Blitzer must mold his Jamaican recruits by teaching them the basics of the sport. The results start out rather rockily, for the rugged, tropical Jamaican landscape has absolutely nothing to offer in the form of snow, cold and ice, which would allow these first time bumbling Olympic athletic hopefuls to gain some further insight on how to better prepare themselves for the tough road ahead. The hilly Jamaican terrain would soon serve a purpose here, as the sport of bobsledding requires much agility and speed necessary to navigate the many curves and slopes throughout the course. But, in order for these athletic hopefuls to accomplish their goal, they need to raise money for the trip to Canada and the 1988 Winter Olympic Games. Despite the necessary coddling courtesy of Coach Blitzer, who is unable to borrow the $20.000 from the local Olympic Committee that is needed to send the troops to Calgary. On to Plan B, where our future Olympic hopefuls attempt to raise the money on their own through donations, but are only able to scrape up less than $1000, well short of the money needed for the trip. Plan C turns out to be the charm, as one of the athletes, named Junior, receives a cash loan (obtained by him through a small white lie) from his wealthy father (who wholeheartedly objects to his son's amateurish career choice), plus Junior having to sell his car to cover the remaining cost of the trip. Now, the wheels are set in motion. As soon as the boys and their coach arrive in Calgary, they receive a rather harsh greeting, courtesy of the harsh, bitterly cold winter weather. Sanka Coffie (Doug E. Doug), Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba), Junior Bevil (Rawle D. Lewis) and Derice Bannock (Leon), are having great difficulty in adjusting to their new winter environment, while Coach Blitzer seems to feel at home in the whitewash (he ought to, being that John Candy's Canadian! - although in the film he's from the U.S., kinda ironic, huh?). Blitzer sees to it that his boys are not affected by the negative surroundings, not to mention the harsh reception by everyone from the International Olympic Committee to the other athletes. The coach gives the guys a strict training regimen to better prepare them for their qualifying run, which got off to a shaky start, eventually being the laughingstock of the Olympic Games. Well, as they say, practice makes perfect, as Coach Blitzer &amp; Co. are off to try their nighttime practice qualifying run again, this time coming ever so closely to the one minute official qualifying time limit, but fall just short at finishing with a time of one minute, two seconds. The third time would be the charm, however, as the crew finished their final practice run before the real Olympic competition, finishing at under 1 minute (59.46 seconds, to be precise). Now, it's on to the real trials, where the Jamaicans come out of the gate slowly and unsurely, thus continually being mocked at by their adversaries. Coach Blitzer is proud of his team, nonetheless, so the guys go out and celebrate their somewhat major accomplishment, as a result of their second Olympic run. There's still more work to do, however, before the Jamaicans' third and final run, which is a must see. Many a viewer of &quot;Cool Runnings&quot;, will be both happy and heartbroken upon seeing the spellbinding ending, which will teach chidren a very important life lesson and instill confidence in them at the same time. Adults will like it for many of the same reasons, including the harsh Canadian environs in which &quot;Cool Runnings&quot; was filmed. The warm stylings of the reggae music are also a perfect compliment to both the Jamaican and Canadian environs, as well as to the film's soundtrack. With the fact that this is also one of John Candy's final films, makes this feature a must see, must buy for the entire family. Don't miss out!ian environs, as well as to the film's soundtrack. With the fact that this is also one of John Candy's final films, makes this feature a must see, must buy for the entire family. Don't miss out!
B00003XACV|5.0|To put it simply, this music is so perfect and beautiful that I had to run to my computer in the middle of it in order to tell as many people as possible about it, and this not the 1st time I've listened to it (by a long shot).  The fact that this brilliant score lost the academy award to -what was it, The Lion King?- was THE most  flagrant error I have witnessed in the world of arts. Not only did it make the movie come alive poetically, it is fantastic in it's own right. Now to find more Thomas Newman...
B00003CXDZ|5.0|This movie was brilliantly scored and the visual effects are cutting edge. Now add some old songs and new and Nicole Kidman in a love story and you have a surpise hit of the Summer. Go with an open mind and enjoy this masterpriece.!!
B00005BL2A|4.0|Ok...I agree that I was expecting something a little more from DM, and hoping to hear that unique sound that only DM offers, BUT, I must say that after listening to the CD a few times (and you must do this!) things started to click. Besides the main single DREAM ON, give a listen to &quot;SHINE&quot;, &quot;I FEEL LOVED&quot;, &quot;I AM YOU&quot;<br />Sure there's a couple tracks that don't measure up, but for the most part, the CD rOCKS...(in a Depeche Mode kinda way).<br />It will all come back...I promise!
B00005B4GU|4.0|Okay, Thom gets 4 stars for using computers &amp; digital sampling in a highly expressive and creative way.  But I must admit, I REEAALLY long for the raw energy of the '90s Radiohead.  &quot;The Bends&quot; and &quot;OK Computer&quot; are still their finest moments.  &quot;Knives Out&quot; only hints at their past greatness.  However, any Radiohead CD is still miles above anything by their peers!
B000002GY9|5.0|Hard to pick a fav waits album as they are so diverse, but this one gets special recognition. I've been known to kick back with the lights off, drinking bourbon and smoking cigarettes--and just about choking back tears while listening to this. This album can reach into your soul and pull out emotions you didn't know you had. Listening to this album makes me feel like I've trolled a thousand alleyways, weathered many a storm, many a hangover, and held up more than a few lampposts. Highly recommended, even if you hate earlier and later Waits. God bless that guy!
B00005B4GU|5.0|you can trow away &quot;KID A!&quot; this album means buisness ! ok number 1,3,10,11 are ok the rest r the best thanks radiohead for your great music my dad has seen you twice and he said you were great i will come to one soon if anyone hasent got this GET IT !!!!!!!
B00005BJC7|5.0|This review is for those of you wondering what is different about the limited edition and if it is worth shelling out the extra money for (since it isn't apparent from this listing, and the above photo is actually of the regular edition).  Look elsewhere for reviews of the music (which is excellent).<br />There is not a second of additional music in the limited edition. No hidden tracks, remixes, etc.  Just the exact same musical content on the exact same cd (except it is printed in Europe).  The only difference is in the packaging.<br />With the limited edition import, the cd comes inside of a bright red hardcover book.  This book is basically the same one pictured on the cover of the regular edition (without the wear and tear).  The book has a dimension approximately four times the size of the one depicted on the cover of the regular edition (the actual cd booklet, not the photo above).<br />Attached to the inside front cover of the book is a library jacket which contains a sign-out card and is also used to hold the cd.  The remainder of the book reprints all of the artwork from the regular edition's booklet, with the exception of the last page (which lists the recording credits), but at a larger size, with the sides cropped to various degrees to allow for the book's different shape (but, consequently, there are sometimes details visible at the top and bottom of each page of artwork that gets cut out of the regular ed.'s booklet).  The artwork underneath the cd tray in the regular ed. is also reprinted as one of the pages, and there are four additional pages of artwork nowhere to be found in the regular ed.<br />So is it worthwhile?  Only if you want to get an interesting collectible or invest in something that might increase in value, or if you are a huge fan of the artwork on Radiohead's other albums such as Kid A and OK Computer.  Personally, I found it to be quite cool, but I wish there was also bonus music.
B00003CXDZ|3.0|To those of you who were reading the other rviews, the review titled, &quot;PR dept. hard work.....&quot; is completely wrong.  They were not testing for alternate endings.  The whole story is based upon the greek myth of Orpheus.  You can tell by watching the movie that that story is loosely parallel.  Secondly, before I talk about the movie as a whole I will tell you why, I believe there are pop songs in a movie based in Paris during 1900.  In the movie it talks about the Bohemian Revolution.  People that participated in the revolution were called bohemians.  Bohemians wrote in the style, going in the whole idea of the revolution, of reminiscing about youth experiences, making things that were unique and groundbreaking, they tested the edges of acceptability, and rarely, if ever, gave credit to things of the future.  The writers picked Moulin Rouge as the place where the story was set because it was in the past and didn't give them any reason to give credit to a place of the future.  The pop songs are in it because the writers are reminiscing of songs from their youth, even some of its audience's youth.  This combination of pop songs in 1900 tests the edges of acceptability, and it is so well put together that it is unique and groundbreaking.  Now, this movie is so wonderful!  I went and saw this movie even without knowing anything about the plot except Nicole Kidman is a hooker in a nightclub and falls for a penniless writer (Ewan MacGregor).  I think it was much better that way.  The musical numbers are terrific, especially Tango de Roxanne(in which the tension bulids every layer of the song, I had no idea that music could add so much to a movie), and the rendition of Come What May at the end of the movie.  Many people say that the way Nicole and Ewan fall in love is stupid.  They have barely met and Ewan sings Your Song and Nicole falls straight in love with him.  Yeah it's kind of dumb, but hey, all musicals are like that, if you were expecting Silence of theLambs you're out of luck, but if you were expecting an amazing love story you're in for a treat.  Once you get past when they first fall in love, this movie is a gem!  Those of you who are still skeptical, it is a knid of melodrama, and it's a romance, and it's a tragedy, it's so many things!  I can't really explain it all that much so just go see it!
B00005B4GU|3.0|Isn't there a bit of hypocrisy in a band that rants against capitalism and only puts 43 minutes of music on a full priced CD?<br />It's good but it seems like it's the stuff that didn't make Kid A.  I wish they'd waited untill they came up with enough material to make a new album and not re-cycled the old material.  <br />Save your money for the next album.
B00003CXN4|1.0|I rented this movie this past weekend.  I heard that some people liked it and others did not, so i wanted to form my own opinion.  My opinion is that this movie was a utter disgrace to film making.  It was awful, not entertaining, and boring.  I wanted to turn the dvd off but my girlfriend kept saying \\"Maybe it will get better.\\"  Well just for curiousity I fast forwarded through the rest of the 40000 chapters.  Lets give a synopsis of all the chapters.  \\"OH LOOK WE ARE TALKING\\" \\"WE ARE WALKING\\"  \\"OOPS WE ARE DOING DRUGs\\" \\"OH NO MY DAUGHTER IS A DRUG CRAVING WOMAN\\" \\"OOPS WALKING AGAIN\\" \\"IM MAD\\" \\"ISNT MEXICO WONDERFUL\\"  there is the entire movie, so thank me cause i have saved you the 20 bucks to buy this movie
B000050IMG|4.0|I saw SCARY MOVIE in the theaters last summer with my older sister. We laughed, of course - I couldn't stop laughing - but it was more like sick humor. Also, all they were doing throughout the flick was offending other movies and stuff [i.e.: THE SIXTH SENSE, THE MATRIX, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, SCREAM]. There really was no point to this flick, except to make fun of everyone and everything. Which is cool...but only up to a point. What I did think was cleaver was the way they named the characters. Anne Faris's  character was Cindy Campell (as in Neve Campell's character, Cindy in SCREAM) and then there was Buffy Gibnore, as in Sarah Michelle Gellar's character in I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. I also liked the part when James Van der Beek popped up in one of the sceens - that was funny. The acting was pretty well-done, too. But still, some of the movies they made fun of I don't think they should have, such as THE SIXTH SENSE, because that's one of my favorite films. I know the offensive parts shouldn't have been taken seriously, but some people find it offensive, anyway. Still, a great flick (strictly for the mature adult/teenage audiences only) to kick back and relax with your best buds. It might not be the kind of flick you'd want to buy...but if you can get it for free or rent it, then it's a good flick to watch.
0780631684|5.0|THIS MOVIE WAS JUST INCREDIBLE, CREEPY AND INTERESTING.  ALL I CAN SAY IS BUY IT, WATCH IT, AND YOU WILL PROBALY NOT WANT TO FLY ANYWHERE FOR AWHILE.  JUST THE IDEA OF HAVING A ENEMY YOU CANT SEE, BUT KNOW THAT IS THERE IS JUST MIND BOGGLING
B00005B4GU|5.0|this album is very good in some parts and very weird in some parts but is outstanding. but to start i have to say it is not KID A. it doesnt flow like kid a did even though thom did a great  job again. i would prefer you buy kid a before you buy this. still amnesiac has a great droppy fell like youre floating in a sea of red water. Amnesiac gets 5 stars/
B00005BJ2O|4.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE! IT IS ONE WILD RIDE AND THE SOUNDTRACK IS JUST ABOUT TOPS TOO! A FEW MUSICAL SNIPPETS ARE A BIT POINTLESS BUT KIDMAN SOUNDS WONDERFUL AND MCGREGOR IS JUST SMASHING...NOT ONLY DOES HE GIVE THE BEST PERFORMANCE IN THE FILM BUT THE MAN CAN SING...WHO KNEW?
B00005B36H|5.0|I'd always figured Tool was a lame &quot;nu-metal&quot; band with reams of angst and minimal talent.<br />However, this album had become the focus of a discussion among progressive metal fans whose opinions I highly respected. I was hearing some interesting adjectives applied to them: &quot;intricate,&quot; &quot;original,&quot; &quot;intelligent,&quot; &quot;progressive.&quot; I was interested, but still skeptical. These guys were popular, after all, and I assumed that they were appealing to the lowest common denominator like so many&quot;\\"nu-metal&quot; bands.<br />My curiosity was compounded when I saw the phenomenal music video for &quot;Schism&quot; on MTV. It was a delightfully surreal pictorial essay with a theme of renewal and emotional interaction (I think). Although the video is excellent, the music also captured my ear. I was unable to get that final menacing line, &quot;I know the pieces fit,&quot; out of my head. The song possessed interesting progressions, complex syncopations, and good deal of musical muscle. I could tell these guys were more than a &quot;let's scream and bang on guitars and drums and sound angry&quot; band. (Also known as a &quot;nu-metal&quot; band...if that stuff is your cup of tea, you are at this point invited to hit &quot;Not Helpful.&quot;)<br />So I bought Lateralus. Initially, it appealed to me because of the mystery of the compositions, and the understated imagination of their music. I found it self-consciously alienating, for it is very dark and eschews melodic hooks. I suspected the album was a challenge, so I persevered. The excellent production lends to that mystery...it is very bass-heavy and Keenan's distinctive voice is sometimes barely audible, like a forlorn spectre. At other times, he's incredibly visceral and venemous, with a telling, indignant quality that perfectly fits with music so oppressively bleak. With each listen, I found something new, and as I began to follow the lyrics (note: get them from the Tool's site), things began to click. I started understanding the deliberate austerity of the music and appreciating it from an artistic perspective. It's experimental, somewhat unsettling, and tense.<br />And this is not the kind of stuff that beats you over the head with a loud, raucous song in four minutes. The average song length here is 8 minutes or so (not including the segues and track 13). This allows the band to express more lush ideas with their music, and be more experimental. Many songs contain hard, crushing moments balanced by slower, quieter moments. It only rarely &quot;rocks&quot;...Tool likes to draw you in with hypnotizing rhythms, sweeping textures, and crafty orchestrations instead of &quot;rocking out.&quot;<br />And I am tremendously impressed by their work. This isn't progressive metal in the same vein as Dream Theater or Symphony X. In fact, I hesitate to call it metal. It IS heavy, but it's very subtle and insinuating. However, it is _progressive_ in that it does new things, pushes boundaries of categorization, and challenges the listener. This is the kind of music that requires some effort to &quot;get&quot; (as in understand), but it's a satisfying achievement to experience it.<br />One of the best albums out in 2001 so far, I'd say. (It would get extra stars just for the cool packaging, but I can't give it 6/5.)
1558908323|4.0|Mira Sorvina gives a splendid performance in this effects filled, creepy and tense exersise in traditional creature features. Sorvino plays a scientist who finds a cure for a deadly virus by creating a new breed of cockroaches called &quot;Junos.&quot; After the virus was wiped out, the Junos were destroyed. However, years later, the Junos have evolved into giant roaches that live in the sewers of New York, praying on humans. While there are some standard cliche's in this well crafted horror movie, the latter of the film is in Sorvino's performance and the excellent special effects. Director Guillermo del Toro does a great job of keeping the tenstion at a high mark, and you can tell when you're sitting on the edge of your seat biting your nails. This is an excellent installment into the creature feature genre.
B00004XQ83|5.0|My perspective is a little different from most fans of the sound track. I bought the cd first because some of my favorite performers are on it. Only then did I want to see the movie. For those who are new to old time/bluegrass, and may want to explore what else is out there, I can suggest some recordings in the same vein as those on the sound track, all of which I'm sure are available from Amazon. First, my two favorite Norman Blake recordings are &quot;Back Home in Sulphur Springs,&quot; and &quot;Whiskey Before Breakfast,&quot; and another with his wife, Nancy, &quot;Blind Dog.&quot; My favorite all time Emmylou Harris recording is her all gospel &quot;Angel Band&quot; CD. There's a wonderful collection of lesser known Carter Family recordings, &quot;Clinch Mountain Treasures,&quot; on the County Sales label. And for those who loved Ralph Stanley's rendition of Oh, Death, there's a great CD of his a capella gospel songs &quot;Almost Home.&quot; Also, check out two CDs of old time music by younger performers, &quot;Big Hoedown&quot; by Bruce Molsky and friends, and &quot;Mule to Ride&quot; by Tara Nevins of Donna the Buffalo fame. These should be enough to get you started. Enjoy!
630575067X|5.0|Some may say that this is a step away from what we remember from the original &quot;Star Wars,&quot; but this is an excellent installment in the series. George Lucas has re-captured what made the originals work and blended it with great special effects. Lucas' fantastic storytelling has taken on new shape and form without taking away from the majic of the original &quot;Star Wars.&quot; Well done!
B00000IPAX|1.0|This cd just plain [stinks]. I was a fan of Blink 182 for a long time and being a fan of pop punk in general (New Foung Glory, Green Day, Ataris, etc.), I was really pumped for this album.  Cheshire Cat was an absolutley amazing pop punk album, probably the best pop punk album ever. Buddah and Dude Ranch were also great albums. So, knowing this and hearing What's My Age Again which was a decent single, I expected some good stuff. Boy was I dissapointed.  The album is filled just bad songs that disgrace the name of punk. If Blink wants to make this music they should at least let their new fan base of 13 year old girls know that THIS ISN'T PUNK.  It disposable garbage that old fans of Blink shouldn't even consider picking up.  Let's just hope that their next album heads back towards their roots
B00003CXP1|5.0|I made me queesy, it made me sick, it made me think. This was a simply brilliant film. Powerful and never holding back on its message, Darren Aronofsky's second film was a transluscent and horrific film that made me never want to go near any type of drug. Aronofsky has followed &quot;Pi&quot; with another work of art that should become a fast classic. Ellen Burstyn is astonishing in a brilliantly edited film that made my best of the year list.

0060922583|4.0|The concept of the universe as a giant hologram containing both matter and consciousness as a single field will, I am sure, excite anyone who has asked the question, &quot;What is reality?&quot; This book may answer that question once and for all.&quot;
6304935870|5.0|Although I haven't seen the new film with Ben Afflek I am am sure that it will be entertaining as a story, but nowhere near the truth that this film is.  I found it singularly ironic that Jason Robards, who played General Short, was a radio signalman on a ship in the harbor at the time of the attack.  In narrating one documentary on the attack which was shown on PBS, he remembers decoding the message, &quot;Air Raid Peral Harbor.  This is no Drill!&quot;<br />While I am not going to visit the controversay surrounding the attack and the various conspiracy theories that abound, it is clear that Admrial Yamamoto is clearly portrayed.  A tragic figure in history, somewhat like Gen Robert E. Lee, he went into battle reluctantly and did his best for a cause he knew would be lost.  He spent the 30's stalked by assasins from the Army, and when the Japanese Army took the government, he was willing to go to war with the Army.  I find myself wondering how history would have changed if that had happened.  For an interesting read I would recommend &quot;The Reluctant Admiral : Yamamoto and the Imperial Navy&quot; by Hiroyuki Agawa, also available from Amazon.<br />However, the video accurately portrays the events surrounding the battle.  Historically, the Americans felt that the war would begin with a battleship conflict and an aerial attack in the Phillipines.  From E. G. Marshall's portrayal of Col Bratten, to Martin Balasm's portrayal of Admrial Kimmel, the program displays almost the commedy of errors that led to American forces being so unready that they didn't have a single plane in the air at the time of the attack.  The effects are spactular, given the technology of the time, and unlike the contemporary film, portray ships that did appear in the battle.  Truely appreciate this truthful portrayal of the begining of the end of America's complacency .
B00005B36H|1.0|Or is it a hardcore version of The Police. I know they are influenced by Pink Floyd and King Crimson, but he sounds a lot (ok maybe a little) like sting to me. This cd doesnt suck, its just not great, or good, ok it sucks I hate to admit it.
0670880728|2.0|I did not expect a literary masterpiece when I started this book, but I was expecting a bit more than what I got. The character Bridget is so &quot;frightfully&quot; annoying that I found myself wanting to choke her. The humor was way too obvious with only a few one-liners that managed to give the book some redeeming qualities. This is an OK read for a 14 year old who isn't an intellectual giant, but those not in that category should just give it a miss.
6303213650|1.0|It's been a good while since I've seen this, movie so forgive me for my harsh generalizations.  I know there will be Coen Brothers die hards that will not appreciate a negative review, but for those of you who are a little more traditional, just a warning that you may find this movie quite pointless.<br />I quite enjoy movies without a purposeful plot, and I am not one to who even likes to write negative reviews, knowing they will be unappreciated, but I STILL took the time to find this film and warn others.  That should be enough evidence for you alone to be sure you at least rent the film first if you are still interested in watcing it.  <br />I liked Fargo, also by the Coen Brothers, but this film, as well as Raising Arizona, both seemed somewhat pointless and couldn't keep my attention long enough to make me even want to finish the film.  I literally sat through an 1 1/2 of this movie waiting for it to go somewhere and got so frustrated I turned it off.  The plot doesn't seem to do anything, and all I was left with was a memory of the supporting actress's incredibly poor acting and New York accent.  Just a little heads up to newcomers--you've been warned.
B000000OUJ|3.0|This Cd is tight and the lyrics are really really FAt, but i dont really loved it, people seem to think that it's the best Wu solo, but i dont think so (well, it's just my opinion) But it's still a good album, if you love rap, you should have this album in you collection. Best song are: Liquid Swords, 4th Chambers (really good song), swordman (my favorite) but there's other really good song. So like i said, if you love Rap Music, you should have it.
6304765789|5.0|Anyone who claims this movie was predictable, or that the ending was a let down obviously didn't get it.  I regret that there are those who didn't bother suspending their disbelief for even a second to try and grasp the whole purpose of the film.<br />I have reapeatedly recommended this movie to friends, telling them always, &quot;This is the only movie I can promise you won't guess the ending to.&quot;  At first watch, no matter how many times you think you've got it, you still don't.  Without saying too much, the second viewing lets the purpose of the plot sink it, and your understand the sort of &quot;suicide intervention&quot; that takes place, as Douglas's character finally understands himself, his true motives, and his emotional health, independant of all the money in the world.<br />This may not make much sense to someone who has never seen this, but I don't want to ruin &quot;The Game&quot; for you.  Buy it, watch it, play along, and you'll love it.
0866119949|5.0|This book really took me at heart.  The thought of such a young firl who is positive through all the bad and the good.  Nothing was unhappy or sorrowful.  To have such an impact on a whole town is what caught my attention and made it one of my favorites.
B00005BJC7|4.0|This album is yet another good one from Radiohead. Perhaps &quot;good&quot; is a bit of an understatement, but I think amnesiac is a bit of an understatement as well. This band continues to explore different areas of rock themed music, and we are lucky enough to be able to listen in. Thank God a band is out there to deliver something that is truly progressive in this era of poppy-punk and annoying talentless bands. &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; and &quot;Dollars and Cents&quot; are true gems to be found on this album, and &quot;I might be Wrong&quot; and &quot;Knives Out&quot; aren't half bad either. Although this album fails in comparison to Kid A, Amnesiac is still heads above any other album that was or will be released this year. I can't wait to see them in Mnt. View Ca, in just a few weeks, it should be truly amazing.
0804106304|5.0|This book was very well written with truth of the Chinese culture during the earlier years.  To show the pain and suffering of the women was extreme.  The fair and unfair reality between families and yet in the end, they all still hold a strong bond.
B0000025ZF|5.0|I have had half of this CD on a tape I've had for probably 15 years now.  I had no idea where it came from.  I thought it was 1 song and I thought it came from Pink Floyd.  This &quot;song&quot; was one of my all time favorites.  Gotta love the internet.  After only 2 minutes of searching I found this is not just 1 song, but a collection of songs.  You would have to be nearly brain dead not to appreciate the moods this album takes you through.  I can't wait to hear the whole thing.  I'll update my review once I have.
0792842073|1.0|I have never felt so ANGRY about seeing a movie. That nun held  his hand, said &quot;Goodbye&quot; and he had the chance to say his &quot;Goodbye's&quot;. I say,  What a nice way to go because his  victims didn't have such opportunities. Now he will never escape, be paroled, or God forbid freed only to reoffend. The actors, the story, the filming itself was well done. It must have been good to elicit such strong emotion from me. This is no feel good movie though &amp; I'll gladly never see this one again. I only wish I could forget it.
B00005IBGQ|4.0|After listening to Rufus Wainwright's new CD POSES, I think Rufus is well on his way to a long and successful career.  Anyone can have a great first album, that second album is what really matters.  Did he use all his creativity on the brilliant self titled debut?  Not even close. From the first chords of &quot;Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk&quot; to the last notes of, well, &quot;Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk&quot; (a remixed version appears at the end), Rufus shows more of his witty lyrics, lush orchestration, and passionate voice over and over.  Something a little different is that there are actually a few songs that sound stripped down - especially &quot;Shadows&quot; and &quot;One Man Guy&quot; - though they have more of what Rufus does best.  His lyrics have mostly dropped the hopeless romantic in hell vibe I got from the first, and picked up a much more cynical tone.   This album is the perfect follow up by a truly original artist.  He gives his fans more of what we want, and goes in a few new directions to keep his material interesting.  I HIGHLY reccomend you get this album.
076790382X|4.0|Though I liked the book overall, and I really did, I found that after a while it was a bit trying how much Bryson seems to put down the very country he has chosen to live in.  From complaining about the amount of choices in the supermarket, to our over reliance on fossil fuels and cars, it gets a bit trying.  What I really found ironic was that even though Bryson puts down Wal-Mart and big discount chains I bought is book at Costco!  At a deep discount no-less!!
0312117337|5.0|I've never bought into the &quot;divination&quot; description of Tarot cards. Instead I've always thought Tarot cards were better suited as tools to lend insight into current situations. The Osho Zen deck is perfect for this task.<br />I have been searching for the *perfect* Tarot deck for myself for years. I've always been uncomfortable with the traditional Rider-Waite symbolism, and always thought many decks (Rider-Waite or not) were unattractive. I've never been compelled to pull any of my decks out and consult them more than once in a blue moon. There are a few decks I've found along the way I like- the Connolly deck was an early favorite, with its bright and luminous illustrations and positive descriptions, and an I-Ching deck I was given for Christmas. But no deck I have ever seen or touched has been as beautiful as the Osho Zen.<br />First and foremost, the illustrations blew me away. I just can't describe how beautiful they are. I went through the entire deck and and spent an hour &quot;ooohhh&quot;ing and &quot;ahhh&quot;ing over the cards. I have never seen anything quite like these cards. Their representations as well as the feel of the cards really makes me want to take the deck out and shuffle through them and read about every card. I have never felt that way about a deck before. It's so inspiring.<br />Although many people claim its a deck strictly for dealing with the &quot;here and now&quot;, I disagree. In the past few days I have done several readings with the deck for insight on my own situation and have found the deck to be very helpful. The cards are *not* vague, but not entirely specific, so it allows the user to apply the meanings to their own lives.<br />The cost of these cards is slightly higher than most other decks, and the caption describing the deck as a &quot;game&quot; may prevent certain people from buying this deck- it did for me. But what a mistake that was. If you are drawn to the illustrations on the box/cover, purchase this deck. There is something very special about it. It puts other decks to shame.<br />Thanks, Mom, for getting this for me for my birthday!There is something very special about it. It puts other decks to shame.<br />Thanks, Mom, for getting this for me for my birthday!
B00005A1PR|5.0|I was, as expected, thrilled with this entire album.  <br />After being exposed to India.Arie's 1st single, &quot;Video&quot;, I knew I wanted more.  I was more than pleasantly surprised by the stripped down acoustic infused with danceable, hip-hop beats. Her lyrics are thoughtful and I am thoroughly impressed with her songwriting, as well as the production of this album.<br />I highly recommend this album for anyone who is a fan of the Lauryn Hill, Jill Scott or Dionne Ferris genres of vocalist. There is a little something for everyone on here.
B00005BJC7|2.0|A few albums in, and I still don't get it. What's so great about Radiohead? Don't get me wrong, The first record was tuneful, downright hummable, albeit generic alterna-pop. &quot;OK Computer&quot; was, well, O.K., but, I never understood the hype. If you ever heard Brian Eno's &quot;Before and After Science&quot; or &quot;Another Green World&quot; you wouldn't have been so impressed by OKC's derrivative sound. &quot;Kid A&quot; is probably the most interesting record, but often too oblique and full of pretense to bear. &quot;Amnesiac&quot; is just another tepid disc full of ordinary corporate guitar pop with some electronic flourishes. That's all. There's nothing special here. Snotty reviewers will try to convince you this is an &quot;important&quot; record, but, in the immortal words of Chuck D, don't believe the hype.<br />If this is the best the modern major labels can do as far as &quot;art&quot; goes, leave me out of the whole game. Go listen to Giant Sand, Tortoise, Neautral Milk Hotel, Summer Hymns, Will Oldham.... there is plenty of thoughtful, original music available.... Radiohead isn't it.
B000001DTM|5.0|Though I have to say that The Joshua Tree was the pinnacle of U2's career, Achtung Baby comes in a close second. This album saw U2 moving in a completely new direction, making them sound markedly different, but still distinctly U2. Just like the Beatles did on Sgt. Pepper and the White Album, U2 decided to expand their music horizons and grow as artists. The result is one of the most daring and underrated albums in rock history. Achtung Baby, along with the Joshua Tree, puts U2 in a place of honor among legends such as the Beatles and the Who.<BR>The music on Achtung Baby is laden with swirling guitars and drum beats, creating an almost psychedelic effect that sounded like nothing we had ever heard from them. However, no matter how they are decorated, its the songs themselves that are going to decide how long people will be listening to an album. U2's forte has always been strong songwriting, and Achtung Baby doesn't disappoint. Bono's lyrics are personal, creative, and desperate at times, resulting in a surprisingly dark and introspective record. Some of U2's best music is on Achtung Baby, but it takes a little while for it to sink in. Once it does, it doesn't fade. &quot;One&quot; has to be one of the best songs U2 ever wrote, with lyrics of sorrow and of hope all at once. Then there's &quot;Until the End of the World,&quot; with the lyrics spotlighting a conversation between Jesus and Judas (try finding something that poetic on a boy-band album!). Other highlights include the brooding &quot;The Fly,&quot; the infectiously catchy &quot;Mysterious Ways,&quot; and the lovely minor-key lament &quot;Love is Blindness&quot; (the lyrics of which sound like a poem out of one of Jim Morrison's notebooks) The band shines throughout the album, especially The Edge, whose guitar work on Achtung is undeniably brilliant. He is one of the most unique and innovative guitarists in rock, and this showcases his virtuoso talent. He can play anything from his patented ringing echoes to a Hendrix-like crunch or a groovy funk riff. Bono is a gifted singer, with an amazing range and stylistic versatility. Larry Mullen's drumming and Adam Clayton's bass are seamlessly performed. U2 are a rare band that can manage to be eclectic and varied, but also have a unique sound that is all their own. They also have a gift for immaculate songwriting, and Achtung Baby delivers.
B000002MJC|5.0|SOFAD is definitely one of my top three albums by DM.  When the album first came out, the fans were worried that DM was going to steer clear of its electronic roots.  But, their attempt at making a rock 'n roll record paid off.  Hell, it debuted at #1 on the Billboard charts, so they must've done something right.  The best track on the album is &quot;Higher Love&quot; without a doubt.  &quot;One Caress&quot; is a beautiful track supported by a live orchestra.  &quot;I Feel You&quot; is memorable due to the tracks intense guitar riff.  All in all, you won't be disappointed with SOFAD.  Considering all the internal problems in the band at the time, they were able to grow and evolve in their music.
B000002UDB|5.0|I love this CD mainly because of I am the walrus. It's sooo different.  And the song does not only lives of the Martin Production. It's the great lyric , it's the powerful and orgiastic voice and the compelling chords. I als like the version on Anthology without Production. godlike
B000002L9M|4.0|&quot;Black Celebration&quot; is probably my second or third favorite DM album behind &quot;SOFAD&quot; and &quot;MFTM&quot;, of course.  &quot;Stripped&quot; has got to be one of the best songs Martin Gore has ever written and the melodies are much more intricate and detailed than those on the previous album &quot;Some Great Reward&quot;.  Definitely pick this one up!

0425107469|5.0|As a fan of this genre, I think I've got just about every book Koontz has written. This is hands down the best I've read by him and I would recommend this book without reservation to anyone. It reaches beyond the typical horror novel and the story is well written. For those who have read other novels by Koontz and not this one; don't wait! If you like what you've read so far; this will blow you away.

B00004XONN|1.0|alright folks, we need to quit listening to the artsy-fartsy critics trying to tell us how &quot;revolutionary&quot; this album is. These critics had led us to believe that it is so amazing that if we do not appreciate it, it's due to our own ignorance for art-rock. After making myself listen to this album just to find some redeeming quality, all I could dig up was the studio musicians they hired to play real instruments, only so they could play with it enough to make it slightly less distinguishable. The lyrics are repetitive, and his voice, quite annoying. Now if the words contained in the booklet underneath the disc-tray were the lyrics in the songs, This would be a wonderful CD, instead it's his whiny voice droning over some electronic noise they must have concocted in just a few hours.

Lowpoints: The instrumental songs....they don't add much.

6305399212|5.0|After Alien I really wasn't sure I'd like this follow up.  Besides rarely does a sequel live up to it's predecesor (Star Wars did but that's another story).  This has got to be the scariest movie I've ever seen.  The setting is perfect, and the fact that you don't know who's going to die next has you sitting on the edge of your seat.  This movie is not about gore at all, it has a great story line and some great actors.  The marines, for example Hudson has a great sense of humour and seems unafraid of anything until he sees the Aliens.  There is a tremendous character growth to all those who come face to face with the Aliens and it really shows in the movie.  Even the android Bishop (gotta love that knife thing he did to Drake and Hudson) will have you laughing.  My favorite character has got to be Hicks, calm under pressure, brave, keeps his head.  Aliens was one of the best trilogies ever (why did they have to make Resurection?!) and this could very well be the best movie ever made too.  Get out there and rent it this instant you won't regret it.
0783240503|2.0|However, if you found Cats silly and lacking in plot, you'll pass this one by.<br />It opens well, but as it goes on it just gets silly, and lacks Biblical correctness.<br />As far as family viewing, some may not appreciate seeing Donny Osmond practically gang raped or Joan Collins nipple costume.<br />Joseph King of Dreams (a cartoon) is better.
B000059HB7|5.0|Whenever I come across a slice of movie perfection such as Rio Bravo, I always wonder, &quot;Why don't they make movies like this anymore?&quot;  This film is nothing short of spec-tac-ular!  As always, John Wayne is solid and dependable as the town sheriff fighting off a band of ne'er-do-well's in a small Western town  (Hmmmm...where have I *seen* that before?).  But it's Dean Martin's performance as Dude, the recovering town alcoholic that'll knock your socks off.  This fella can act!  It's his performance that really carries the movie.  Way to go, Dino!
0440219078|3.0|My wife and I loved this book for the first 2/3, but then the plot lost its way and the characters went with it. I would still recommend reading the book, just borrow it from someone else!
B00000634L|5.0|Bran Van's Glee sounded like no other 1998 album.It mixed different kinds of music styles like rock , pop , hip hop , soul and funk all done with an extra-cool attitude which was impossible to resist. &quot;Drinking In LA&quot; was one of the best singles of that year ,  relaxing and highly enjoyable . Then there was goofy yet lovable lazy-boy DiSalvio on &quot;Couch Surfer&quot; , sensitive female touches on &quot;Everywhere&quot; , Beastie Boys-like rapping on &quot;Forest&quot; and ofcourse that amazing cover of Slade's &quot;Come on feel the noise&quot; . This is a record which can make you smile and feel good everytime you listen to it and  , in addition to all that it will certaintly take  you a long time before you get bore with it (it includes 16-17 songs , you know... ) . Bran Van 3000 are the friends we would all want to have to cheer us up.
B00004THAY|5.0|I've always loved the works of these two phenomenal artists, and I've always leaped at the chance to hear them together.  However, this experience had been limited to maybe a few appearances on TV...  However, when I first saw the ad for this album, I ran to the store and bought it, right then.  What I heard absolutely blew me away.  This was the most soulful, wild, yet clear thing I've ever heard.  I especially enjoyed the rendition of &quot;Three O'Clock Blues&quot;  Eric and B.B. both deliver incredible guitar riffs and great bluesy, bawlin vocals.  And, in response to an earlier review, I didnt know it was possible to have a &quot;too long and drawn-out&quot; blues song.  The longer the better.  An absolute must for a music fan.  Period.
B00004R7AP|1.0|why did the corrs do an unplugged session? i mean, they don't play any rock music and they're practically acoustic already. don't get me wrong, i think they're an awesome band but this was stupid. besides, who does unplugged sessions anymore anyway? they're definately not what they used to be.
B00003CXP1|5.0|Darren Arnofsky made a great movie with PI, but he truly exelled in his latest one. &quot;Requiem for a dream&quot; is an incredible movie, actually, more than a movie, its a masterpiece! The photography work is incredible, the transition to scenes is exellent, the music gives it a great feel, and let us not forget the acting. The acting by Ellen Burstyn is amazing, she completly transforms herself for the role. Seeing this movie makes you realize how badly this movie got jipped at the oscars. Julia Roberts doesnt deserve to have been in the same category as this amazing actress. Marlon Wayans suprises anyone who sees this movie with his incredible perfomance and seriousness. Jared Leno does an incredible job at showing his desperation throughout the movie, and Jennifer Connelly did a super job. The movie is a must buy, not a rent!
B00005B4GU|5.0|If you listen to Amnesiac long enough, it's becomes very seperated from Kid A.  The beats are a little grittier, and the vibe is a little bit more fierce.  Definitly worth the money for the trip.  I listen to it all day long.  You should too.
B00003CXN4|5.0|In a close tie with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Traffic comes up 2nd for best picture of 2000.  Traffic is an incredible view of the vain war on drugs.  The acting here is marvelous.  In particular, Benicio Del Toro and the unrecognized Don Cheadle stand out.  <br />What makes this movie work?  It's not all about Hollywood glory and it actuallt tells a story.  The three separate color schemes that separate subplots work with mastery.  This is a great movie to own.<br />Much better than the woeful Gladiator.  Will somebody tell me why that was given the Oscar for best picture?
B00005B4GU|5.0|Hmmm...first 'Pablo Honey' comes out and all of us who were 13 at the time thought 'Creep' was a neat song. We bought the CD. Then 'The Bends' came out. 'Fake Plastic Trees' is pretty neat. We also bought this CD. Then we heard 'Paranoid Android' and we knew that we had heard only the beginning of what this band was capable of. We also purchased this CD. We waited four long years and then bought another new album, 'Kid A' based only on anticipation and were very, very pleased. Then we waited 8 months and bought 'Amnesiac' because we knew that it could only get better than where it was. And it did. 'Pyramid Song', 'You And Whose Army?' and 'Knives Out' are three of the best Radiohead songs I have ever heard, and the fact that they are all on the same album doesnt hurt. I know this review probably isnt very helpful, but when a band like Radiohead wows me everytime they start a song its hard to prasie them more than how you feel in your head. Words dont convey emotions so well.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I recently just purchased this album from the local music store where I purchase all my music.  I was in the mood for something different when I noticed this.  When I purchased it I had no idea what to expect.  Let me tell you though, when I got home and popped it into my cd player, I sat down and listened to the whole cd all the way through.  Thats something I usually never do because not all the songs are good.  That is definitly not the case here.  From Love Me Do to Penny Lane this CD rocks with some of the Beatles best #1 hits.  Also, this CD provides a good introduction to the Beatles for anyone who has never heard them before.  And the best part of all(in my opinion anyway) is that the tracks are easy to sing along with.
0618129014|5.0|The Lord of the Rings. If you have not heard of it by now you should buy this. This is a complete edition that has all three of the books (The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King) as well as the appendix. This is one of the best fantasy stories ever (I myself have read it many times) and will soon be a movie. So, but this great book while you wait for the film's release!
B00005BJ2O|4.0|An absolutely outstanding soundtrack to one of the best films this year!  The only thing I would change would be to add two more of the songs that were in the film:  &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; (Nicole Kidman, et al, when Satine is going to break it off with Christian) and &quot;Run For 50 Years&quot; (Nicole, Ewan, John Leguizamo, et al, when they are pitching the play to the Duke).  THAT would have caused me to rate this CD a 5!<br />A must-have, nonetheless.  Spectacular Spectacular!
B00003CXE7|3.0|This is my second review of Gladiator.  Why?  Because I am that disappointed that it got the award for best picture.  This movie was typical summer fodder for American film-goers.  A story that was akin to Braveheart with a predictable plot.  Yawn.  Oh, the action sequences were great - though they were too few.  The subplots were under-developed.  This movie was just okay.  <br />If you want to see the real best picture of 2000 look no further than Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  Also much better is Traffic.  <br />American movies are so self-absorbed with big budget over the top CGI than bombard you and leave any resemblence of story to waste.  Titanic, Pearl Harbor, Gladiator....when will the litany of pomp and circumstance end?
0060392886|5.0|I laughed, I cried, I cringed. An excellent book detailing Motley's career the past 20 years. Their rise to stardom, their faults, drugs, alcohol. Not for the faint of heart as this goes into extreme detail regarding their escapades.<br />Very well written and kept me page turning throughout.
B000002GIE|5.0|Yeah this album has its flaws, but it's still one helluva debut album.  This was just a taste of what was to come from the most underrated, overlooked band who ever made the big time.  One thing is for certain: There will never be another Extreme. Ever.  I think it's a shame that more people weren't aware of the talent involved.  It seems to me that their biggest audience was other musicians.  Nuno Bettencourt started off great and even went so far as to surpass his influences.  I own everything Extreme ever did, Nuno's solo album &quot;Schizophrenia&quot;, and Van Halen's III.  Extreme put out four major albums before their break-up, after Gary Cherone left to join Van Halen.  <br />This is where  it all started.  Uneven? Yes.  Still, there isn't what I would call a &quot;bad&quot; song on the whole album.  <br />I can only hope that this band will one day re-unite.
B0000013OZ|3.0|This CD can be divided in two parts: one that is poor, and other which is not so poor and can even be of considerable interest (mostly if you are going through a particularly &quot;anglophilous&quot; period of your life). In such way, my advice to other customers can be as well divided in 2 points:<br />1.If this record caught your eye because you're looking for Elgar's &quot;Introduction and allegro&quot; then forget about it, since the version here included is rather poor and dissapointing. If Elgar's pieces are your main interest, then look for Sir John Barbirolli's magnificent account with the Sinfonia of London and the (then) New Philharmonia now available in EMI's Great recordings of the Century at a very reasonable price. <br />2.The suites we get here from Sir Hubert Parry (An English Suite &amp; Lady Radnor's Suite) are decently reproduced by Leaper and the Capella Istropolitana (though one may ask a bit more of strength at some points). Considering that one doesn't gets this music all the time, you certainly won't be waisting your money investigating in this record for the work of one of the most important precursors of the Brithish musical renaissance. Besides, we get a very pleasant view into the work of Britten's mentor, Frank Bridge, with &quot;Lament&quot;, a piece from which Leaper draws some nice atmospheric playing.<br />The recording quality is good, excepting for some lack of balance in Elgar's Introduction &amp; Allegro, a piece that is always a bit difficult to record as it comprisses two different ensembles interacting in a musical dialogue sort of reminiscent of the concerto grosso that cannot be recorded in the same manner as with the Parry pieces where you just have a traditionally assembled string orchestra.<br />Oh... yes, the Downland piece is quite enjoyable, but lasting only a minute and a half one feels that it's place belongs to other CD, as it is the only XVIth century piece between a record of late XIXth-early XXth century music.
B00003CXBH|5.0|Roland Joffe has created a visually stunning masterpiece with The Mission which also won the coveted Palme D'Or at Cannes in 1986.  From the opening sequence with the crucified Jesuit being placed in the slow moving river only to be caught up in the rapids and then over a spectacular waterfall - STUNNING - you are transported to a very magical and dangerous time.  Roland Joffe films on location in the amazon basin and captures the feel of the jungle.  Joffe tries to capture the redemption of man and his service to others.  First there is Jeremy Irons coming to grips with himself being the one who had sent the previous missionary that met with the fate of crucifixion and the withdrawl of support from the papacy; and there is Robert De Niro's character - a slave trader that murders his brother in a jealous rage only to later repent and become a Jesuit himself. Rodrigo's (De Niro) penance begins with him dragging all of his weaponary and armor with him through rivers and up mountains and sheer cliffs - a breathtaking sequence.  When he is forgiven by the very natives that he had previously killed and enslaved, you feel your own tears flowing with his.  <br />This film is fairly accurate in a historical sense - and really captures the zeal that the early members of The Society of Jesus (Jeusuits) had for spreading the gospel and &quot;civilization&quot;.  The aspects of the wealthy power brokers working with the papacy to try to rid the New World of the missionaries is very accurate.  All in all a wonderful movie - one that I never tire of watching.  Other movies in this same vein include Black Robe (A Jesuit in Quebec) and the often overlooked At Play in the Fields of the Lord - which is a wonderful adaption of the novel - another must read is the late Fr. Malachi Martin's book The Jesuits - it provides additional background information behind this movie.  This is one of those movies that everyone should see at least once - and that will probably not be enough.
B000002IZM|5.0|Simply put, the film BladeRunner would not have even been close to what it is without the music of Vangelis.  this sountrack is fantastic.  from the eerie start with &quot;main titles&quot; through to track 3's &quot;wait for me&quot; continuing with the amazing &quot;rachel's song&quot;, this is a recording that doesn't quit.  the typical, futuristic music of vangelis is in full force here, and listening to it you just can't help seeing, hearing the future...it's stunning.  i looked for this cd for years and was on cloud nine when i finally found it many moons ago.  if you want something that will transport you to another time, another place, then do yourself a favor and get this cd....and if you don't have the film BladeRunner on DVD, then  there are two things you need to get.  the soundtrack and the movie.  it's that simple.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Those of you who have only been exposed to &quot;Creep&quot; playing over and over on the radio(yes, it is a great song), you have no idea how far Radiohead has come. Get &quot;Kid A&quot; and experience something so emotionally hypnotic that you're left wanting more. Then have &quot;Amnesiac&quot; ready, so you're not one of the unfortunate one's like myself, that had to wait. This is a GREAT cd.
B000002BSV|5.0|I've heard so many people complain about how after Bernard Sumner left, Suede is no longer worth listening to because Bernard Sumner is the greatest and best member. Well that's just (crud). And Suede proved this point with Coming Up. I have to say that the Post-Bernie-Suede is a totally different Suede, but I think it is just as good as the old Suede if not better. Suede is all about sex and drugs and rock and roll, and every single song on Coming Up reflect this. I think songs from their previous two albums are rawer, sadder, edgier, and the lyrics are more hardcore. On this album, the melodies are more refined and smoothed out. The strings on songs such as \\"She \\" and \\"The chemistry between Us\\" are arranged by Craig Armstrong, who gave the songs a more melo-dramatic feel than if it was there. \\"Beautiful Ones\\" is by one of the best suede songs ever written. It is energetic, it is cynical, and it is extrememly catchy. \\"Picnic by the Motorway\\" is simply dreamy, \\"Saturday Night\\" is sweet and flowy, althought it is very hard to imagine any of Suede's songs as sweet. The songs are still sad, but less violent than their earlier stuff. There are bands out there who writes good songs, but over time, their become tiring because they are so similar. Suede write songs about the same subjects, with the same characters, but put them in different scenes, which makes the songs almost serial. The girl from \\"The Asphalt World\\" on Dog Man Star, is \\"She\\" on Coming Up , who on her worse days morphed into \\"Sadie\\" on Sci-Fi Lullubyes, and on better days is the model in \\"She's in Fashion\\" on Head Music. So if you are a big suede fan like I am, you can follow the different story lines Brett Anderson gives to his characters through out their albums. I think people shouldn't get hung up on who's no longer in the band, but rather the music. Coming Up shows a softer side of Suede, which is not as bad as some people might think.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Amnesiac is a haunting, dark, yet beautiful album. It follows Kid A with electronic music, but it also has a very unique sound. Standout songs are Pyramid Song, You nad Whose Army, and Knives Out. I also like the revamped version of Morning Bell, so what if its on Kid A too. This cd is a very worthwhile pick!
B00005IBGQ|5.0|He's finally back. With a new album &quot;Poses&quot;, full of style, tasty melodies and delicate lyrics, Rufus Wainwright once again reminds us that there are still young and extremely talented musicians left out there.<br />What's great about it is that he stuck to his style of having  the melodies be front and center, but the production quality has been taken to another level. More commercial, yes, but this also means more accessible for new listeners.<br />Highlights include: Cigarettes &amp; Chocolate Mix, Poses, Grey Gardens &amp; One Man Guy&quot;<br />Definitely worth having for a true music fan.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Those of you who have only been exposed to &quot;Creep&quot; playing over and over on the radio(yes, it is a great song), you have no idea how far Radiohead has come.

B00003CXDZ|5.0|I see just about every movie that comes out because I am a manager at a local theater.  I got to say that this movie was incrediable.  It was way better than Pearl Harbor.  I already saw it 3 times and I still have a craving to see it again.  Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman deserves a oscar for their perfomance.  Who knew they can sing so beautifully(I listen to the soundtrack everyday in my car).  This is a musical that was long overdue to be put on the big screen.  Baz Luhrmann is a genius.
B00004TH83|5.0|Lara Fabian deserves more than just a head nod or a brief applause of 15 seconds. The general public is clueless to acknowledging talent when it presents itself. They will jump to their feet for gold chains, baggy jeans and rhyming monosyllabic garble/lyrics conforming to anything that's 'in'. Ms. Fabian presents as a very talented artist who rises above the usual mediocrity of the music industry without the hype of the media (e.g. Whitney, Brittany, Celine). She is not only beauty to the eyes, but also to the ears.
0060392886|5.0|&quot;The Dirt&quot; by Motley Crue and Neil Strauss is a must have for any fan of rock n roll music.  Motley Crue has been a high profile in the media for twenty years, but even the biggest Crue fan will find information in this book that was previously unheard of. Considering this book was compiled from all of the band members, as well as their managers, Neil Strauss did an excellent job of piecing the book together to hold the readers interest. One might find the book hard to put down, except to rest from the weight of 430+ pages. Being that I am one of the biggest Crue fans I wish that there was more to the book. Hopefully, there will be a Part 2 to this truelife story that some people couldn't even imagine up. Excellent reading!!
6300247120|5.0|Well, what can I say, I'm a biker and this is the first and best biker movie that captures the pain, pleasure, suffering, and elation of riding a bicycle.  The transfer to video tape was good.  The only improvement would be a widescreen DVD transfer someday.
B000002HJD|5.0|Mr. O'Connor, what precisely qualifies you to make such offensive and slanderous remarks about this album?  Agreeably, Morrison included some obscene statements, but if anything they served to enhance the message.  Life is angst, pain, doubt, confusion, and eventually senility and death.  Obviously, Jim handled this knowledge bravely (and hence, poetically).  Yes he drank, and was probably an alcoholic by heredity.  However, this can easily be forgiven when one listens to the impassioned, yet despairing, lines of the poem, &quot;An American Prayer&quot;.  &quot;Give us a creed to believe...Give of color, Hundred hues, a rich mandala for me and you.&quot;; certainly not the musings of a &quot;pretentious&quot; fool.  Other touching, powerful pieces include &quot;Newborn Awakening&quot;, which hints at a belief in transcendance; &quot;Gently they stir, gently rise, The dead are newborn awakening, With ravaged limbs and wet souls, Gently they sigh in rapt funeral amazement.&quot;  His double meaning for &quot;rapt&quot; is a very interesting play on words.  The dead are being viewed as newborn children awakening in a new state of existence.  Possibly, a state they would never have concieved of as possible.  &quot;Curses, Invocations&quot; demonstrates some of the inherent absurdity of life, with all manner of people in &quot;search of the woodvine&quot;.  This life involves countless forays after things that will only make us miserable.  Overall, if you like Edgar Allan Poe, Walt Whitman, mixed with Bukowski and Burroughs, you will love this album.  Let's be honest, life is unrelentingly brutal, and Jim is a good shoulder to cry on.
080017948X|5.0|93 glowing reviews with one lone dissenter. Scroll down, you'll find him. Giving this film a 'one-star' review is like standing on a mountaintop and screaming &quot;I have no taste!&quot; Also, anyone who uses the word &quot;dilly&quot; in a review is not to be trusted. <br />This film marked a major turning point in Murray's already interesting career. It's funny, profound and touching without digressing into any of the baser attributes associated with those narrative qualities: funny not crass, profound but not pretentious and touching without being sappy. This is a high-concept comedy that explores every avenue of its absurd premise and finds something new at every turn. <br />Excellent writing, wonderful acting and tight, controlled direction.
B000001FSR|5.0|Tom has taken his narratives to a new genre - &quot;opera romantico&quot;. On this album he attempts (and acheives) to put forth a story about a man who, I percieve, is to be going through a mid-life crisis in a drunken haze.  The story has many emotional extremes including the main character (Frank) experiencing 'mania' in &quot;I'm going straight to the Top&quot; and remorse in &quot;Train Song&quot;.  As for other characters in this two act saga there don't seem to be many except for the ones that Frank speaks of.  The lyrics are mostly Frank's dialogue, singing, shouting, and justifying his emptiness and despair with the happiness of a drink.  This is a very moving subject and an excellent example of how deep Tom Wait's music and lyrics can be.
0141000198|5.0|Bridget's diary reminded me of a Salvador Dali painting. It may not be the most educational read, but it sure was fun. She had sarcasm and heartache, be it from a man or her Mum, coming out of every page with somewhat eyerolling, but in a good way, results.<br />I'm a guy, and I could relate with a few of her thoughts, so other people have to feel the same.<br />The Daliesque imagery comes out in fully during &quot;November&quot; when everything suddenly begins to revolve around a crime. Sure, you'll be saying &quot;Where'd that come from?&quot; But go along for the ride. It's a goofy one.
0792151712|5.0|The three-disc special edition is a must-have for Titanic fans. Finally, you get all the extras you've been waiting for: extensive documentaries, multiple commentaries, and beautiful packaging. Basically any extra you can think of is included in this DVD package. The only downside is that the movie, because of the commentaries and extras, is split between two discs. If you're like me and enjoy watching the movie all the way through with no breaks, I would recommend getting the original single-disc DVD along with the special edition. That way you'll have the extras plus a way to watch the film without interruption (just like you did in the theater). The only way this DVD can be outdone is when it comes out on Blu-ray. But until then, this is the next best thing.
B00005B4GU|5.0|What can I say? Radiohead's last 3 albums have been masterpieces and this one is another. Words cannot begin to describe it
B00003CXDZ|1.0|Outside of the interesting wardrobe I had little use for this film. It just wasnt funny enough to be a comedy nor was it serious enough to be a drama. By the time &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; popped up in the movie I was at the point of banging my head on the back of my chair to distract myself from the film.
B000002H70|5.0|No doubt the best Cure album ever, and one of the best from any one in the music industry! You know how you have a CD you like for a few songs? You know that feeling, and how you're always skipping to those songs and ignoring the others? Doesn't happen on this ablum, every song is amazing. Robert's creative and despairingly sad work on his Fender Bass VI and his unique, angst ridden vocals make it worth listening to alone, but then you have the synth leads, the incredible ranging bass lines and the heart-beat drums. Every song is so full of atmosphere and emotion that every song makes you feel like you've lived a suicidally depressing life time as you are compelled to listen through the whole album all the way through over and over. Good for any mood, but fits if you're feeling down or depressed, especially if it's due to love troubles. Every song is flawless in its ambience and image-portraying power. Even though the songs all have some of the same qaulities, they are all very different and you won't get bored until you reach the end. Just recently I took a few days to sit down with my guitar and learn the songs on this album and it has only served to highten my appreciation. I particularly like playing &quot;Pictures of You&quot; and &quot;Same Deep Water as You&quot;, but I also love &quot;Lullaby&quot;. A must have album, especially if you're a goth or are interested in gothic music.
B00003IPFK|5.0|Writer Larry McMurtry excels at creating rich, engaging characters that snug up to you like a pair of well-worn leather boots.  Gus McCrae, played by Robert Duvall, is one of the best-written roles I've ever seen on film.  Hats off to Duvall for playing the part so brilliantly.  But that's just one of many memorable characters in this western saga that skillfully weaves several storylines into an exciting adventure with a human touch.  Don't let \\"Made for TV\\" scare you from this one.  It may be a bit unfair to compare a miniseries with shorter feature films in this genre, but I'd rank this among the greatest westerns ever made.
B00005B36H|5.0|Be forewarned... Tool's latest album will be only decent to the average fan. If you are one of the few Tool fans who openly understands what Maynard is trying to say (I'll admit he even goes over my head occasionaly) you will love this album, just due to the fact that the lyrics are the most important part of this album. While it does lack the acid-soaked masterpiece like Third Eye off nima, it is an incredible piece of work as a whole, and is definately this first cd I've bought in a long time that was worth every penny. At 78 minutes of music, it is very long, but offers enough differentiation dynamically to keep you interested. The packaging that surrounds the cd is the most inventive I've seen, almost on par (or perhaps beyond) to the famous zipper cover of the Rolling Stones' Sticky Fingers. While you can download the entire cd with ease nowdays, Tool has raised the bar in record production by including such a compelling package, you're missing half of the experience with only the music. Buy this cd, smoke a bowl, and BE HERE NOW. You'll enjoy yourself.
B00005B36H|5.0|I don't seem to understand the big problem with Lateralus.  I've been a big Tool fan for a long time and have long since gone on to much heavier music (Blood Duster, Brutal Truth, Dead America to name a few) but I have always been able to come back to Tool and be instantly into the music.  Well I got Lateralus the day it came out and I don't have a single complaint about it.  I hear so many people complaining about it, from everything to not enough anger to not enough swearing.  Here's the point if you are actually a Tool fan you will like it.  If you were a Tool fan and don't like it you never really were a Tool fan.  I think there's a bit of something for everyone that likes Tool on it.  If Opiate was your favorite Tool album put on Ticks and Leeches (its easily their most aggressive song).  If Undertow was your favorite Tool album I think the Grudge (plenty of Opiate and Aenima influence in it) and even the Patient (because of the guitar playing on it) are good choices.  If Aenima is your thing then put on the Parabol/Parabola combo...easily my favorite Tool song of all time.  And if you like Perfect Circle best put on Disposition.  Like weird noise tracks Tool are famous for?  Throw on Faaip De Oiad.  Third Eye your favorite Tool song?  Put on Relflection.  The drumming rocks, the bass playing is good..yeah Adam does play a little loud on this one but I can hear MJK loud and clear..and he sounds good.  And why is everyone saying he has less range on this one?  Christ, he does everything on Lateralus.  He even actually screams which is the first time since Opiate and Undertow.  He does the angry vocals he is more famous for here and there (especially on The Grudge, Schism, Lateralis, Ticks and Leechs and Parabola).  Honestly you ARE NOT a Tool fan if you don't like this album.  Sure this album breaks no major new ground for the band..i heard different things here and there but its basically Tool 2001 era.  Live with it.
0792842499|5.0|The last and best installment in director Sergio Leone's man-with-no-name trilogy.  A gritty, sometimes funny, sometimes touching tale set in the middle of America's Civil War era. This would take the title of greatest western ever but gets edged out by Leone's subsequent work, Once Upon a Time in the West.  Composer Ennio Morricone's music is perhaps the most memorable score ever for a western.  As with the other brilliant Leone/Morricone collaborations, the music works in perfect harmony with Leone's drawn-out style of filming to enhance and punctuate each moment. The DVD contains several deleted scenes that true fans won't want to miss.
0517053616|4.0|I have always wanted to read William Shakespeare but several of my friends who were English majors in college told me I was crazy. They even had trouble with it. I love it. I cant get enough. I read Hamlet first thing after I opened the package. I recommend it for anyone who wants to deversify and defy the tight boundry that people try to fit us all into. Buy...Its a &quot;must have.&quot;
B00005BF9Z|4.0|Clandestino was a great album, but Prxima Estacin: Esperanza is better than. The single that I listen all tha day &quot;Me gustas tu&quot;, have a lot of different rhytms, including top music from around the world, he also likes to visit &quot;La Candelaria&quot;, a great neighbor from my beautiful city, Bogot. The shot from his video with Mano Negra &quot;Seor Matanza&quot; was made in La Candelaria with some poor people from &quot;El Cartucho&quot;. I think that Manu Chao is a simple guy with lot of things to remember, in his composition, performing and singing part.
B00005B4GU|4.0|Alright, I enjoyed Amnesiac thoroughly.  But Radiohead is still not living up to the standard they set with OK Computer.  Yes, it was a classic, and hard to live up to.  But they showcased considerable songwriting skills on The Bends, which was nearly as good as OK Computer.  In the case of Amnesiac, they deal with ups and downs.  For every incredible song like &quot;Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box&quot; there is one totally incomprehensible like &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors.&quot;  Although &quot;Pulk/Pull&quot; isnt't a terrible song, it does not live up to anything the band has previously produced.  Still, Radiohead knows how to make great music, and most of this album is excellent.
B00004XOWM|2.0|...\\"My Generation\\" is another rally annoying song, along with \\"Full Nelson,\\" \\"Getcha Groove On\\" and almost every other song on this CD. Only 3 songs kept me from giving this 1 star. The rock version of \\"Rollin\\" is a pretty catchy, fun tune. Also is the extremely mellow ballad \\"Hold On,\\" something most fans of Limp wont like because it is so different for them, but I think it is a very good peice of music. And finally is the best song on this CD, the MI2 theme \\"Take A Look Around.\\" Still, if all you want is that song, then buy the soundtrack to the movie. Unfortunately for me I bought this instead, and instead of getting another great album like 3 Dollar Bill Y'All, I got 3 good songs...
B00004XONN|5.0|Well, rarely has the quality of an album been as debated as Radiohead's Kid A.  And with good reason.  It is easily one of the most difficult albums of the past 10 years, and it came packaged with immeasurable hype.  Does it live up to its hype?  No.  Is it bad?  Not in the least.  In fact, it is one of the most interesting statements a rock band has ever made.  Thom Yorke certainly has brass ones.  After making the highly lyrical concept album OK Computer, he follows it up with an album comparable to a Jackson Pollack painting.  But somehow it works.  The songs have a cohesive quality which makes the album greater than the sum of the individual tracks.  Songs like &quot;The National Anthem,&quot; &quot;Optimistic,&quot; and &quot;Morning Bell&quot; are the stand-outs.  No one song on the album feels disappointing and consequently the album feels fresh and new.  Let's hope though that Radiohead doesn't quit writing and singing songs altogether.
B00001NFCY|5.0|Creed is probably the best rock band to surface in the past few years. Their first album, &quot;My Own Prison&quot; was a masterpeice, and this album is just the same. And while Creed is often called nothing more than another Pearl Jam imitator, they are actually incredible artists with true feeling for their music. Scott Stapp's lyrics are very powerful and poetic, sometimes full of love, sometimes full of hate, all sung with an incredible voice. I can honestly say their isn't a song on here I don't like. My favorites are &quot;What If,&quot; &quot;Beautiful,&quot; &quot;Higher,&quot; and &quot;Wash Away Those Years.&quot; And just to set things straight, Creed IS NOT CHRISTIAN ROCK! They are a grunge group with religious influences, that is about all. And, just one little note, don't go out buying this expecting a handful of ballads like &quot;With Arms Wide Open.&quot; That is a great song, no doubt, bust most of the material on here is very hard, making even &quot;Higher&quot; seem fairly light. I highly suggest this album to all rock fans, I'm sure you wont be dissapointed.
6305075379|5.0|Before I wrote a review for this film I had to get my hands on a version with the original Aussie dialogue to see if it truly mattered.  Well the answer is, yes it does.  Other reviewers are correct when saying the dubbed version (in American English) makes the actors come off campy and it hurts the film a great deal.  And yes, dialogue is even changed slightly, some more than others, like when the one kid and his girlfriend leave town in his hotrod with the biker gang hot on their trail.  In the American version he says &quot;Don't worry&quot; to his girlfriend, but in the Aussie version he says &quot;No worries&quot;.  I don't really think a dubbed English version was necessary.  I could understand what they were saying even with the Australian accents.  I mean imagine network TV dubbing Crocodile Hunter every week with an American accent...BAD IDEA!  Now that the DVD is out of print (because ORION Pictures is out of business) let's hope Warner Brothers obtains the rights to this masterpiece, digitally remasters it (Dolby Digital 5.1 or better) and gives us the Aussie Soundtrack.  Japan released this film on DVD with both Audio tracks (But in Region Code 2 only), so it's about time we got the same thing.  In fact, Warner should re-release all three films in a nice box set and make them all special editions.  The latest VHS version of The Road Warrior (Mad Max 2) included a retrospective documentary that was never included on the DVD.  To me, this is a great film that deserves the S.E. treatment.  It's hard to believe it was only Mel Gibson's 3rd film (After Summer City &amp; Tim).  This movie is set during the decline of civilization and Mad Max 2 is set shortly after that when civilization is all but destroyed and scattered.  Mad Max sets the standard for the sequals and truly gives us a man gone mad by the loss of loved ones at the hands of not just the bikers, but the decay of life as we know it.  I love the trilogy...rare that each one is uniquely special in it's own right, yet still propells the character forward.  Mad Max is a Classic, so Warner Brothers needs to get a move on with that remastered version (you know they won the rights to it) so people can see the original Mad Max in all its glory!....G'day!
B000000WZ4|5.0|don't listen to anyone who disses this album. it is my favorite dm cd next to violator. the last three songs are ...ahhh just too good for words. ok? buy the damn thing
0790729342|5.0|It's hard to believe, but originally no sequel was planned for Mad Max, an Australian film that became a box office smash in the country but was poorly released in America (with a terrible dubbed language track to boot).  But director George Miller had been watching a lot of Westerns and realized why people had gravitated to the Max character.  Slowly he came up with the idea for the sequel and went to work, this time with a bigger budget.  The film takes place shortly after the original film, where by this point, society has decayed almost completely and all that matters is survival from the biker gangs who crave gasoline to power their vehicles.  And in all this chaos is Max, an ex cop, gone mad from the loss of his friends and family.  It's interesting to point out that Max had humanity in the 1st film, then lost it after his losses, so in this film there is very little humanity...just a dog eat dog world with every man for himself.  Max is a burnout.  My favorite scene is when Papagallo (Mike Preston), the leader of the small group with gas, starts attacking Max, asking him if he enjoys seeing each day blur into another out there on the road and what was it that burnt Max out.  And when Pappagallo realizes it was loss that did this to Max he lets him have it by saying &quot;You think you're special?&quot; and godes him to the point where Max punches him to the ground.  A nerve was struck.  That scene is so powerful and is one of the reasons why this film is such a winner.  The sets, characters and locations are first rate, giving a real feel for a desolate wasteland.  If you haven't experienced this movie, rent it on DVD and watch the Widescreen version (2.35:1).  Although I recommend seeing the original Mad Max first, it won't hurt if you don't, thanks to the nice recap at the beginning of Part 2.  Because Mad Max was not a big hit here in America they decided to call the sequel &quot;The Road Warrior&quot;, but everywhere else in the world it's known as &quot;Mad Max 2&quot; or &quot;Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior&quot;.  This was done because Americans might not go see a sequel when they've never even heard of the original.  The trailer you get on the DVD in the USA even refers to the movie as &quot;Mad Max 2&quot; and one thing I found interesting was that the Humungus has a different voice on the trailer from the voice he uses in the actual movie.  Did he get dubbed?  The DVD looks and sounds great thanks to Warner Brothers, who remastered the picture and sound quality.  One disappointment is that the latest VHS release included a retrospective documentary on the film that is not included on the DVD.  Let's hope they include it on the next release soon.  I love all three Mad Max movies, but I will admit that Mad Max 2 is the best of the trilogy, not to be missed.  See how Mel Gibson became an international star.  See Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior.  A true classic.
6304711905|5.0|It's a good western. But Val Kilmer (as Doc's Holliday) is inspiring. He gives a performance that makes you clinch your fists and sit on the edge of your chair (or couch). Remember Jack Nickolson in 'The Shining?' You won't be able to take your eyes off the screen.
B000002J09|5.0|And, those who don't recognize the brilliance of this album are ignorant musically.  The reasons are apparent in other reviews and you'll see yourself after listening to it.  Basically, though, those who babble about Zep's image, or about Zep being a pop act or a rock act, or about Zep's usefullness running out are missing the boat big time.  Rather than concentrating on that nonsense, why not try to recognize the real reason this album is considered one of the greatest.  It's original, innovative, and is of high quality...
6305718954|5.0|I don't understand the criticism on this movie but I thought it was wonderful.  Maybe, many do not know about the lost &quot;bibles&quot; by Thomas, Madeline, etc.  But most of what this movie is about is regarding the lost bibles and what they imply to the point that would be understandble why it makes the Vatican shaking in their boots.  A profound movie, you won't be disappointed!
B000002HMH|5.0|For all of the people out their that gave this cd bad reviews are wrong. You relize if metallica would of kept their old sound they would of faded out. This change they made brought them into the new age rock. That speed metal stuff was great at the time but would of not been popular today. They would of never been who they are today if they would of not made the change. It think cd has a lot great songs on it like bleeding me, hero of the day, and until it sleeps. I think any metallica fan who accepts the change should go buy this cd its just as good as their other's!!
B00005B4GU|5.0|That above statement, declaring &quot;Amnesiac&quot; a more song-oriented album than the amazing &quot;Kid A&quot;, is lazy journalism. While there are more fully crafted &quot;songs&quot; (if you consider those to be verse-chorus-verse) on this CD like the brilliant &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; and &quot;Knifes Out&quot;, there is also some more abstract tracks, such as &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot; &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; and &quot;Packt Like Sardines...&quot; that make most other music (Tool, &quot;Kid A&quot;) sound like TRL material. While it is, as of now, a more dense album than &quot;Kid A&quot; it'll take it's place as perhaps Radiohead's most rounded, best album yet. They have some major tricks up their sleeves.<BR> My prediction: their next album will shake up the world, ala &quot;Nevermind.&quot;
B000002UAX|5.0|1968 was a very significant year in pop &amp; rock's music growth and development. The psychedelic mood that started in 1967 together with the experimentation concepts were evolving into a heavier and more aggressive sound that eventually lead into progressive and hard rock during the 70's. The Beatles contributed to the process of change with this album that consists of a combination of solo and group efforts, and a large variety of different music styles.  <br />Regardless of the different music preferences and the like or dislike for the Beatles' music, the \\"double white\\" adds value based on the following concepts. First, it offered a summary of almost every style played during the 60's. (1) Rock'n Roll (\\"Back To the USSR\\", \\"Every Body's Got Something To Hide\\"...), (2) Heavy Rock (\\"Helter Skelter\\", \\"Birthday\\"), (3) Electric Blues (\\"Yer Blues\\"), (4) Jazz (\\"Honey Pie\\"), (5) Folk-Rock (the album's version of \\"Revolution\\"), (6) Folk (\\"Blackbird\\", \\"I Will\\" \\"Julia\\", \\"Rocky Raccoon\\"), (7) Experimental (\\"Revolution No 9\\"), (8) Baroque (\\"Piggies\\"), (9) Raw expressions (\\"Wild Honey Pie\\", \\"Why Don't We Do It...\\"), (10) Heavy Ballads (\\"Happiness is a Warm Gun\\", \\"Dear Prudence\\", \\"Sexy Sadie\\") and, (11) Typical 60's pop (from \\"Ob-la-di-Ob-la-da\\", \\"While My Guitar...\\" through \\"Don't Pass Me By\\"). Second, the sound of the instruments evolved significantly as  bass was given a protagonic role (\\"Dear Prudence\\" or \\"Birthday\\") as opposed to being kept in the back of the tracks. Guitars were used to create a forceful atmosphere (\\"Helter Skelter\\", \\"Every body's Got..\\"... \\"Yer Blues\\"). Third, the Beatles' grew as individual musicians and as a result the instrument switching during the recordings increased, thus George gets to play bass and to invite Clapton into one of his sessions, while Paul plays drums and guitars on more than one track. Many of the tracks reflect the work of a \\"soloist\\" or of a soloist with a backing group, and the White Album included more of these solo efforts than any of the Beatles previous material. However, I don't find that these characteristics diminish the quality of the album. \\"Blackbird\\" and \\"I Will\\" relate more to McCartney's solo music than to the Beatles, but so did \\"Yesterday\\", \\"For No One\\", and \\"Fool On the Hill\\". In addition, \\"Julia\\", \\"Cry Baby Cry\\" and \\"Sexy Sadie\\" were totally Lennon and distant from the Beatles music, but also were tunes like \\"You've Got To Hide Your...\\", and \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\". The same cold be said for Harrison's compositions, were \\"Within You and Without You\\", \\"The Inner Light\\", or \\"Love You To\\", reflected more George's mood  than the Beatles 60's music. <br />If you have doubts on the value of the \\"double white\\" and its subtleties, let me humbly    recommend that you \\"only\\" compare this material with the sound of the albums issued   during 1967 and 1968. Please abstain from comparing the \\"Double White Album\\" with 70's rock groups, contemporary artists, or any other group that emerged and developed after this  material was released. I've received comments of listeners who argue that many of the tracks sounded raw, unfinished and disconnected from each other. As a result, some seem to think the \\"White Album\\" should have been a one record album instead of a double. Analysing the material I find that there are at least 21 songs that have the same quality standard as the material considered as the group's best. Only 9 tunes out of 30 contained in the album could be questionable. Probably the album should have been a \\"shorter double album\\". <br />My final comment is that the \\"Double White\\" was an innovative concept at the time it was released and I remind music lovers that most of the Beatles' music was \\"perfectly simple\\", which made it \\"simply perfect\\".
B000002O3I|5.0|No doubt about it, these are some of the best songs of the 50s blues renaissance, recorded by one of its most important figures, 300 lb., roaring firebrand, Howlin' Wolf. From the old fashioned party anthem, Wang Dang Doodle from the working man's theme, Goin' Down Slow to the low brow poetry of You'll Be Mine true to blues classics of the era's canyon of standards, Spoonful and Back Door Man, this is the blues defined. Out of all the blues CDs I own this is by far the best.
B00005BJC7|5.0|A wonderful musical experience for listeners, each song another chapter , the arrangements playing beautifully off of each other presenting to the listener sublime subtelty and powerful direct movements.  The music dynamically unfolding, one begins to sense a journey being documented, a story being pieced together using a post modern musical language. Certain themes of confusion and loss return and drift away. Like peeling the layers of an onion, abstracting the meaning that exists at the center of each song. Imagine a story being written down , then the words of the story are chanced upon by a tornado, the words fall back to the earth and someone finding the pieces begins the process of putting it back together. Now imagine your living 50 years in the future you dont know who you are or why your in the middle of a wasteland holding a red book with a frayed spine. This review may seem a bit melodramatic, but I really love this album.   Amazing stuff, not to be missed.
B000059HAI|4.0|TORA! TORA! TORA! (Fox, ...)<br />If you were disappointed by the soulless \\"Pearl Harbor,\\" you might take a look at the 1970 American-Japanese coproduction (a historic first) that examines the surprise attack from both sides. Richard Fleischer oversaw the elaborate 149 minute production (Akira Kurosawa was set to direct the Japanese sequences but he withdrew) that won an Oscar for Best Special Effects.  The sharp widescreen transfer includes \\"Day of Infamy,\\" a new documentary on the Pearl Harbor attack and a lively audio commentary from Fleischer and Japanese film historian Stewart Galbraith.  Recommended.  Rated G.
B00004YC2F|5.0|Volodos is threatening to become one of the biggest pianistic superstars before the public today.  His huge technique has drawn comparisons with Horowitz and his performances have garnered rave reviews from most of the critics.  His performance of the Rachmaninoff Three just about lives up to the hype.  Here we have a performance which combines extraordinary pianistic virtuosity with a ravishing poetic sensitivity.  Volodos' interpretation may be the best since Horowitz's Ormandy performance 25 years ago.  It is certainly the best performance recorded in the digital era.  <br />I still regard the Horowitz/Reiner performance as the greatest ever.  Horowitz' finger busting interpretation has to be heard to be believed.  But Volodos is an excellent choice for those eager for digital sound.  Even better, he plays the version with the longer, more difficult cadenza in the first movement.  Of recordings using this cadenza, Volodos goes to the top of the list.    <br />Along with Marc-Andre Hamelin, Volodos has to be regarded as greatest big technique piano virtuoso before the public today.  Highly recommended.
B00003CXRP|2.0|Tom Hanks loses 40 odd pounds a deserted South Pacific island.  That's about it for plot in this beautiful but ordinary adventure nicely directed by Robert Zemeckis.<br />What one expects from the intentional double meaning two-word title is that our hero experience some kind of spiritual enlightenment from the enforced \\"casting away\\" of civilization's ephemera.  But that is not the case here.<br />It's not giving anything away here to say that during his absence he has been declared dead and his fiancee Helen Hunt has married.  But since we've recently seen Hunt cavorting on screen with Mel Gibson, Jack Nicholson, Richard Gere and Kevin Spacey among others (apparently while Hanks was island-bound), it should come as no surprise.  The two-disc set includes enthusiastic commentary from Zemeckis, a startling featurette on the remarkable and wonderfully invisible digital effects and much more. 143 minutes, PG-13.
0064407667|1.0|This is a total ripoff of the Harry Potter series.  HELLO? The boy even looks like Harry Potter!  They have the same freaking glasses!  How could anyone who likes Harry Potter like this book?  Bad things happen to Harry Potter too at the beginning you know.  I would suggest you read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone before you read it so you can see as I have, that this is a total copy of it.  Harry Potter is much more original.  Like, did this guy, Lemony Snicket, think that people wouldn't notice how his books is like Harry Potter?  Does he think kids are stupid and wouldn't notice such things?  You know what else are copycats? NSYNC copied BSB, Pepsi copied Coke, Britney copied Mariah...
B0000542DJ|5.0|Oliver Stone's films are being re-released in definitive DVD editions with commentary and extras. The masterpiece of the lot is his controversial take on the 1963 assassination of President Kennedy. This terrific two-disc set includes a riveting and highly detailed audio track by writer/director Stone as well as 17 added minutes to the now 223 minute feature. In Disc B, there's a collection of deleted and extended scenes with optional commentary by Stone and multimedia essays that update the assassination.<br />I was in Dallas on the eve of that fateful day. I remember an eerie, blood-red moon hanging over the flower-strewn grassy knoll at midnight. Later, I spoke to a baffled policeman who was running beside the President's car.  I heard many bizarre stories regarding the immediate aftermath of the events of that day including a witness, a local weatherman on WFAA, who claimed he saw Ruby and Oswald together at Dealy Plaza 24 hours before the death of JFK. Like Stone observes, \\"Once you enter the rabbit hole, there's no coming back.\\" This gripping mystery-thriller stands on its own as a great piece of technical filmmaking whether fact or fiction (or both). Stone's incredible commentary raises the drama to a new level -- and is a valuable historical document. Cast includes Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci, Jack Lemmon, Donald Sutherland, Sissy Spacek, Kevin Bacon, and Gary Oldman as Lee Harvey Oswald. Oscar-winning cinematography and editing. Highly recommended. Rated R.
0780628551|1.0|This is a really, really stupid movie with a dumb story and weak acting - Johnny Depp with an insane southern accent.  And if you watch all the way to the end hoping it will get better, you'll be sorely disappointed, as it's the worst part of the whole sorry movie.  Too weak to be a horror movie, too silly to be sci-fi, to sick to be any kind of love story .... whatever you're looking for, you won't find it here.
0670824399|5.0|This has been my favorite book ever since I read it. I now forget most of its contents but i remember it has been an awesome book that I will appreciate.
B00005ASGI|3.0|Volume 23 of Paramount's complete reissue of the Original Star Trek series contains episodes which tread ground familiar to any Trek fan.<br />A Private Little War is a slightly improved remake of Friday's Child (Volume 16).  In this episode, the overall tone is darker, the parallel to the Vietnam conflict is driven home more clearly, and the ending is more ambiguous--fitting, considering how the real Vietnam War ended.  Booker Bradshaw is featured in his first of two appearances as Dr. M'Benga, a specialist in Vulcan medicine.<br />The Gamesters of Triskellion is one of the weakest episodes of the Original Series.  Kirk, Uhura, and Chekov are zapped several light years from their original destination, dressed in kinky S&amp;M obedience collars, and assigned drill thralls--essentially companion slaves (poor Chekov's drill thrall looks like a drag queen from the Jerry Springer show).  Kirk once again gets the girl, and lectures the &quot;advanced&quot; race on the errors of their ways. This plotline has been examined--more effectively--in The Cage and Bread &amp; Circuses.  The saving grace of this episode is that Chekov and Uhura are at last given more to do that recite &quot;Course plotted&quot; of &quot;Hailing Frequencies Open.&quot;<br />The sound and picture are up to the standards of the other issues of this series, but because of the weak writing, this DVD is recommended only to die-hard Star Trek fans.
B00005B4GU|2.0|I didn't actually purchase the new RADIOHEAD CD.  Nope.  Walked around the record store with it in my hand as the always cheerful employees blasted the thing start to finish.  When it was all over, I put the CD back in the display case with fingerprints and sweat all over it and left the store without buying anything.  RADIOHEAD'S &quot;Amnesiac&quot; was to be my last hope in this sad year for music.  And now all hope is gone.  Goodbye, cruel world.<br />(send all hate mail to my email address--i love it)
B000006JQ5|5.0|A magnificent retrospective of twenty-odd years of the beast. I don't now what the &quot;editorial reviewer&quot; was smoking when he was listening to this but I don't think there's a single outstanding omission. &quot;Rime Of The Ancient Mariner&quot; is not only not missing, it's in it's most perfect live expression. And the renditions of &quot;Running Free&quot; and &quot;Fear Of The Dark&quot; could simply send shivers up and down my spine.<br />What I like best about this CD is the feeling that the band was<br />100% behind it... the artwork is awesome, it features FULL lyrics (rare in a greatest hits compilation) and the discography and chart information rocks. You also get some stupefying photos that give some (albeit puny) inkling of the godliness that is Maiden onstage. This is the alpha and omega of the NWOBHM, and I dare say that no metal collection is complete without this masterpiece...<br />Period.
B00005B4GU|4.0|If Kid A was supposed to be experimental, Amnesiac is...very hard to define. This album goes all over the place. Jazz, Techno, even a little bit of Hip-Hop (if I say so myself) are all the musical genre covered by a band who have stepped out of the mainstream themselves. <br />The reason why this album is being bashed my the media is that (1 Even though the shock value has been taken out by Kid A (2 This album is waayyyy out of left field, basically Kid A without the sedatives.<br />As I've said, just because there are guitars on this record dosen't mean they've gone back to their Bends days. &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; and &quot;Pulk&quot; are the 2 most creepy yet innovative yet bizarre songs released by ANY band. This is a direct companion to &quot;Kid A&quot;, and it shows.
B00000I2UE|4.0|Back when The Jesus & Mary Chain released their debut album \\"Psychocandy,\\" curiosity got the better of me and I went to check out the band when they played a gig at a [club], located in one of Detroit's worst neighborhoods. The brothers Reid, accompanied only by a drum machine and their guitars, played a half hour of what sounded like feedback amplified through a fast food restaurant's drive-through speaker system in a wind tunnel, with an occasional hook or melody coming through the din, never turning to face the audience once. So imagine my surprise, and delight, when, a few years later, I bought \\"Darklands,\\" slapped it on my turntable and heard some of the darkest, melodic, most beautiful noise ever committed to vinyl. Songs like \\"Happy When It Rains\\" and \\"April Skies,\\" in a perfect world, would have been huge radio hits. The album that showed the world what is at the core of the J&MC's music when stripped of all the feedback, distortion, and white noise. Simply stunning...
0201633612|5.0|If you consider designing applications you oughta get that book. I have been working with Pascal, C++ and lately with Java. And I had never read that sort of books before. What a shame! I did miss out on some very worthy information.<br />The way the book is constructed is quite clever. The authors first start by some basics and then explain a few patterns via a small word editing tool (Lexi). As they go along, they explain why to use such and such pattern and also how.<br />Then, they list a whole lot of really cool patterns. The way they wrote that part is also very good because not only they describe each pattern in a concise way, they also say why to use it, how, and what are the pros and cons.<br />As I was reading it, I actually realized that the team that developped the &quot;Java Developement Kit&quot; relied heavily on that information. I also dicovered that I had been using some of these patterns myself without even knowing it. <br />For once I finally read a software book without hundreds of pages of code. No filler in this one, guarantied.<br />And plus, it's not even expensive!

B000023VR6|5.0|I have had this CD for about one year and it still amazes me. This has got to be the best CD I have ever heard, the beats, the lyrics, everything is ahead of his time and thats why it is so great. Where else could you find dope beats and rhymes like that. Its one CD that will NEVER be taken out of my CD player. IF YOU LIKE RAP, I STRONGLY SUGGEST PICKING THIS UP...GANGSTA RAP-4-LIFE
B00005IBGQ|5.0|If Leonard Cohen and Ben Folds were to produce a child, Rufus Wainwright would be he. Wainwright's sophomore effort, Poses, is a cotton candy confection full of pure emotions and beautiful notes that delight and perplex. Coupled with the noteriaty of some high profile sound track entries ( Shrek and Moulin Rouge )Poses seems poised to be Wainwright's break-out. Catchy-kitchy melodies like Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk and California stick in the head like a pleasant pick axe while darker tones, Shadows and Grey Gardens haunt and brood like no pop song could. It's albumns like this that keep hope alive that some day we'll live a world without BackSync boy noise. Poses is a lyrically challenging, musically groundbreaking, sweet, smart and damn enjoyable collection of songs meant to tease the senses and touch the soul.
B000002J1B|5.0|As the years have passed, my estimation of Relayer has grown and grown until it has become one of my favorite Yes albums. I've heard critics say that Relayer and Tales From Topographic Oceans are not accessible and hard to &quot;figure&quot; out. Well, thats what you get for being original. I like to think of Relayer as a &quot;Tales&quot; without the fat. All three songs are gems, with absolutely no weak spots. I recently saw Yes (well, at least Howe, Squire and Anderson) perform &quot;The Gates of Delirium&quot; in concert. It was one of the most fantastic musical experiences I've ever had. Sound Chaser just plain rocks. That track contains one of Steve Howe's most stunning, unique guitar solos ever. To Be Over is a real contrast to the wild, emotional swings of the first two tracks with its gentle but powerful melodic content. There were other very good Yes albums after Relayer (Going For The One, Drama, Keys To Ascension and suprisingly The Ladder) but this is the last great album.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Just as Liz Phair's EXILE IN GUYVILLE was an answer record to the Stone's EXILE ON MAIN STREET, Radiohead's 1997 album could be read as a response to Bruce Springsteen's NEBRASKA---because the &quot;meaness in this world&quot; that Bruce Springsteen discovered and made real on that classic LP is multiplied a thousandfold on this album. Tracks like &quot;Paranoid Android,&quot; &quot;Karma Police,&quot; &quot;Exit Music,&quot; and &quot;Climbing Over The Wall&quot; suggest that the Boss was too optimistic...I mean, whereas the guy in &quot;Atlantic City&quot; had at least a faint chance for salvation by winning the Big Jackpot in that casino town in Springsteen's home state, the guy in &quot;Subterrainen Homesick Alien&quot; can only hope for escape from his hard life via abduction by a UFO!
0553573403|1.0|I bought this book on the strength of other reviews here, but had to stop reading after the first three chapters (something I almost never do) due to the book's overly contrived feel.  The main family, the Starks, living on their winter land -- get it?, a Stark landscape. . . The map of the world - a poor rip-off of tolkien with geographic names like &quot;Red Bay&quot; and &quot;Blue Cove&quot; . . . and the writer's inability to build true tension &quot;He felt something was wrong,&quot; &quot;he felt cold,&quot; &quot;he felt forboding&quot; . . .  all conspire to make this a mediocre book and reveal a mediocre writer.<br />Get the real thing - Tolkien, and see what this guy is attempting to emulate. . .
B00003CXMG|5.0|&quot;Almost Famous&quot; is a story that you won't forget. Unlike most movies, there isn't a recognizable person to hate, because everyone has their own demons which they use against themselves. Whether it is falling into a trap you have been warned of (figuratively speaking, of course) or repeating your own, sad history. All analogies aside, this movie had a real story. It had depth, while being enjoyable. The intensity was at the right level so that it can be a feel good movie, or a serious film. The music played was spectacular, and brought me back to some of my favorite songs. <br />We can relate easily to this movie, because the protagonist is an intelligent, normal kid. The mother is everyones worried and paranoid mother, who is under extreme circumstances. The supporting actress (Kate Hudson) is superb in her role. And the band is amazing. This is the kind of movie you can stare at intensely or let it wash over you. This movie was nostalgic for most, and a new adventure for many.
B00003CXRP|5.0|...if you were trapped on an island for 4 years? Hanks does a magnificent job of portraying hopelessness and the longing that kept the character alive and eventually brought him back to civilization. <br />There have been several comments on the &quot;drawn out&quot; scenes in this movie and I have to believe that it is our societies obsession with special effects and action that have allowed this movie to slip through the cracks as one of the better movies ever made. <br />The most compelling parts of the movie were dealing with the character's drive to survive on the island. The fact that Zemekis spent so much of the movie on the island was ingenious! What kind of movie would this have been if 4 years on an island converted to only 30 minutes of screen time? The time spent on the island gave the movie a feeling of authenticity. The real wonder is how the movie keeps you entertained when silence is such a large portion of the movie. It's in these times that we truely connect with the everyday man that Hank's is so brilliantly portraying. <br />This movie is like nothing I've seen before and ranks as one of my favorites of all time!<br />FINALLY A REALISTIC ENDING- INSTEAD OF THE HOLLYWOOD ENDING!!!
0684867621|5.0|I have read several King novel's and this is one of the best books i have ever read. Trisha's perilous journey through the great forest reminds us of how how fragile life is and how with one wrong step, our lives can be altered in ways we can't imagine.<br />This book is truly remarkable because of the numerous hidden meaing described within the text. Overall, an very, very good novel.
B00000G3PA|2.0|I know at first most of you who belong to the Armageddon Haters Clan will jump at me for the rating of two stars I'm giving it.  And by all means does it deserve a one-star rating.  So, I ask my self, \\"self, why am I giving this horrible movie a two-star rating.\\"  ...I do believe that it is scenes like those that actually help you like the characters in this movie.  I personally believe that even if they all are just going to the slaughter house, they might as well have some personality.  Rockhound (played by the frightening Jerry Bruckheimer, I mean Steve Buscemi) is apparently the favorite amongst Armageddon fans (if they even exist anylonger)...<br />The only real special effects of the movie, by the way, were the tiny white hairs they placed on Bruce Willis' head.<br />The real shocking thing about movie is the physics. <br />P.S.  My final reason for giving the movie 2 stars is that I was down in Florida at Kennedy Space Center while they were filming it (but it was raining so we didn't see the crew or anything...would've liked to see that white hair, though).
B00005B4GU|4.0|It's inevitable. After the critically-hailed masterpieces come the backlash. And it's come for Radiohead now. After the &quot;difficult&quot; Kid A, there were rumors floated (by their record label?) that Amnesiac would be a return to straightforward, guitar-based music. WRONG. Amnesiac works in the same vein as its predecessor. And why not? The songs were recorded at the same time. But the boys are going to take some heat now, in spite of the fact Amnesiac is a more intimate, if not warmer record.<br />I, for one, had a small backlash with Kid A. I have no great affection for the vaporous instrumentals (Treefingers, anyone?) that slowed that album down. But low-key songs like Limbo and Morning Bell gradually grew on me. So now, with Amnesiac, I think I &quot;get it.&quot; And their songs, and their electro/ambient approach to them, grabbed me quicker this time. You and Whose Army?, Knives Out, and the new, slow version of Morning Bell pulled me in right away. The title of I Might Be Wrong, and its up-front guitars, could be construed as a humorous statement. If you believe Radiohead has a sense of humor. And I defy anyone to tell me that Pyramid Song isn't one of the most beautiful things this group has recorded.<br />The ever-elusive Thom Yorke's vocals are pushed up in the mix, lending the record that intimate tone I was talking about. And even the disposable instrumentals are a little more agressive this time. So let let critics for Entertainment Weekly, etc. start tipping Thom and Co. off of the pedestal they put them on in the first place. As far as I'm concerned, nearly everything is in its right place.
6305013578|5.0|I won't prattle on too much about how bad the DVD quality is since you probably can read it from every other review here. I'm here to give the movie itself five stars. I bought the Madacy DVD  version even after reading all the horror stories about it because it was about the only way i could see the movie for the first time. The movie is cropped weird at times and the picture quality is less than spectacular but the thing that bothered me the most was the ending seemed cut short, which left me feeling sort of cheated. Despite all of that i still found the film incredible. The scenery and special effects are way before its time. For being a silent movie, the acting is great and most importantly believable. This movie definately conveys an industrial feeling. The opening scene of the horde of down-hearted workers slowly trudging into the elevator that will lower them into a hell-like machine, reminded me a lot of the first Apple commercial. Watching this movie, you will be able to see how many currrent films were inspired by this one. This is a great film that should have more stars than it does.<br />Of course, the review would not be complete with out telling what i think is good accompaning music. I like to watch all silent films with no music at all. For me, it makes me pay more attentiom to the movie. I did find that the Smashing Pumpkins &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; goes pretty well with most of this movie.
B000002UB3|5.0|\\"Abbey Road\\" is a fitting conclusion to the Beatles reign.  The reviewer below obviously did not buy the album when it was released, since there had never been anything like it at the time of it's release.  Slogging the album in the late 90's is easy.  The Album is and was the best the Beatles ever made.
B000002GH1|5.0|Really perfect album. I've getting the nirvana every tikme I listen to it. The duet of piano and guitar is amazing.
B00003CXRP|1.0|I have always been a big fan of Tom Hanks because it seems he reads the scripts presented to him before accepting roles.  In this movie, it appears Tom only read the first 80 pages or so then signed on the dotted line.   This movie had so much potential to be a modern version of Aldous Huxley's &quot;Brave New World&quot; as Hanks' character left civilization and became the savage that had to adjust to normal society.  In its roots, Castaway achieves the &quot;savage&quot; element of &quot;Brave, New World&quot; in the first hour.  And what a first hour it is.  We celebrate when Hanks' character discovers fire and wince when he injures himself.  It is in his struggle that we can appreciate his battle to survive against the elements.  After that first hour, however, it seems Castaway loses sight of its original goal.  Hanks' character seems to have no problem adjusting to life and then the movie ends.  I think Castaway could have been a lot better.
B000002USN|4.0|Yes, expect everything out of this wonderful album of Frank Sinatra and his friends. It includes both his classics as well as some of the less known tunes. The two CD's spans the entire career path of Sinatra and offers his songs in unique duets. Frank Sinatra is one of my favorites and so is this album.
B00003CXSM|5.0|The Wedding Planner, along with Sandra Bullock's Miss Congeniality, is as good as mainstream Hollywood gets these days.  The situations are pretty much as we expect, the characters whacky but loveable, the resolutions fairly predictable, but the writing and acting, like a good cappuccino, are frothy enough that our enjoyment is guaranteed.<br />Jennifer Lopez delivers her commedic role quite well--she's not quite in Sandra Bullock's league here, but then I think it is her first comedy, and she's not far behind. The only real willing-suspension-of-disbelief problem audiences might have is that such a gorgeous woman would have difficulties with relationships, and Lopez plays neurotic well enough that she manages to overcome this issue.  The casting and role of Matthew McConaughey's character creates similar issues which are not quite so readily resolved--he's literally too good to be true, but he acts what the writers gave him with gallons of charisma.<br />The Wedding Planner is a pleasant dip in a shallow pool, and as such is highly recommended.
6305169187|1.0|Easily one of the worst movie I have ever seen. I swear, Michael Bay's answer to any action sequence is the desperate last-second escape, and this one-trick pony strings scenes using this tired device one right after the other over and over ad nauseum. How many numeric  apocolyptic countdowns can you throw into one movie?<br />To say the action sequences are insulting to one's intelligence is a huge understatement. In one space-drilling scene (and my personal favorite), Steve Buscemi's character unwittingly fires a gatling machine gun at his comrades, which causes all sorts of wacky mayhem. Even if the government was stupid enough to issue heavy, unnecessary bulky weaponry for a drilling mission in space which required exacting precision (maybe they were afraid the Martians might attack) why wouldn't they train their people on the use of such equipment? Or at least say something like 'This is a gun. Don't touch. Very bad.' Suspension of disbelief is one thing. This movie require you to suspend your entire brain.<br />The love triangle is the basic Bruckheimer/Bay formula (Just check out Pearl Harbor if you have any questions. No, I haven't seen the movie ... I just know.) You know SOMEONE has to sacrifice himself during a B/B movie. We all feel bad. He died for us (sob.)  It's an emotional rollercoaster!<br />Please. Skip this one. If you don't, you might sleep through it anyway.
B00003CXDZ|4.0|I probably knew too much about this film before seeing it; movies never quite live up to their hype I've found. I loved the musical twists and turns and the character development was excellent. Ewan McGregor has real screen presence and his voice is strong. I was kinda disappointed in Nicole as her voice is on the thin side and her acting was fine, but not a world-rocking performance. Still, this is a must-see ground-breaking movie and a lovely love story.
1878424114|3.0|I would call this book more of a mystical or spiritual guide rather than a practical one. His writings are very abstract and it was quite possible to find a concrete ground to stand upon when trying to understand the concepts. Nevertheless some of the laws do make sense, especially the Law of Dharma which states we all have to discover what are unique talents are and exploiting them. Some of the approaches are rather passive as well, like asking the reader not to defend their points of view. A section explaining on how we should balance these seven laws would be helpful rather than practising one of them per day of the week. I would not put this book on my highly recommended list. The only good points I can highlight is the briefness which allowed me to complete it in a matter of few hours.
B00005J6T1|5.0|This was the album that introduced the Material Girl to the world. How could one predict that from this modest dance/new wave album, that one of biggest artists in music history would be born. Of course Madonna's videos and image have alot to do with her success, but image can only carry you so far. In the end, the music has to stand on its own and her self-titled album does just that. &quot;Lucky Star&quot; is a dance classic while &quot;Borderline&quot; is a classic pop tune with its plucky synth and Madonna's plaintive vocals. It is the successor to the girl group hits from the 60's. &quot;Burning Up&quot; falls under the new wave banner with it's searing guitar and synth action while &quot;I Know It&quot; foreshadows futures songs like &quot;True Blue&quot; and &quot;Cherish&quot; with it's bouncy sound. The albums closer is &quot;Everybody&quot; and is a hypnotic, syncopathic number that begs you to get up and move. Madonna started off slowly when it was released in 1983, in fact it took 58 weeks to crack the top ten, but it laid the groundwork and foundation for her next release Like A Virgin that would take her from rising star to mega-star.  This is a newly remastered recording that includes a couple bonus tracks and the remastering adds a new clarity to the songs.
B000000645|5.0|Viewed by many die-hard fans as the jewel in the crown of Stringdom, this is THE Incredible String Band album to demonstrate, above all others, just what makes this unique band so wonderful. From the opening dream-like reflections on childhood &quot;Born in a house where the doors shut tight, shadowy fingers on the curtains at night&quot; to the the exquisite dying fall of &quot;Nightfall&quot;, this is strange, exotic, mesmerising and mysterious stuff. Oh, and it just happens to be incredibly beautiful as well, for the most part. Memorable highlights abound: Robin's deceptively simple &quot;Witch's Hat&quot; (&quot;sitting on her head like a parrafin stove&quot;), Mike's lush and fascinating &quot;Cellular Song&quot; (amoebas are very small, aren't they?)...thrill to tales of the Emperor of China with his iron footwear, ponder the meaning of &quot;Three is a Green Crown&quot;, or just go with the flow and enjoy. This is truly incredible music. With the String Band currently enjoying a much-deserved renaissance, what better time to get to know this (arguably their finest) album. Then check out Wee Tam &amp; the Big Huge, and 5000 Spirits, for proof that this was no flash in the pan.
B00005BJC7|4.0|I am plesently surprised by the reviews so far.  I was expecting to read slams on this album, much like I've read about Kid A.  However, like Kid A, this is a great album.  True it is not as good as OK Computer, which is why this album got 4 stars not 5.  However, this CD comes close.  I was going to buy it no matter what, but when I saw the video for Pyramid Song a week ago, my appitite was wetted even more.  Thom York is no longer a singer but an instrument that is as vital to Radiohead's music as a guitar is to any other rock song.  Other great songs are &quot;Packt Like Sardines...&quot;, &quot;You and Whose Army&quot;, and &quot;Life In A Glasshouse.&quot;  The only dissapointments are &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot; and &quot;Morning Bell/Amnesiac.&quot;  &quot;Pulk&quot; is just plain scary and belongs on a KMFDM album.  &quot;Morning Bell&quot; is a good song, but is just a remix from Kid A, and with Radiohead one expects all original all the time.  This is a great album, and even though it will be compared to Kid A, it is a completly different, and a little more coherent, body of work.
B00004YM0D|5.0|I never thought that me, a teenager, could actually like this CD.  It has all the great these great songs that you can just listen to over and over and never get sick of!  My favorites are #1,2,3 they are great.  If you are looking for a good CD, don't waste your money on anything else, buy this!
B00003CXHJ|5.0|The DVD version of U-571 is a solid package of not only the great movie about human triumph but also a lot of supplementary materials - interviews done with submarine experts, director, cast and even a rather amusing video clip taken from the Royal Navy archives.<br />I think it is unfair to judge U-571 in terms of its accuracy with history facts. This movie, was NOT meant to replicate any specific event that transpired in the war. If you had seen the DVD's interview clip with the director, the movie was meant to be a fictional tale! <br />I don't know how true the scenes in the movie were when compared to that of the real stuff on a submarine. But for the layman like me, I think it is convincing enough to suppress my skeptism. In fact, the scenes could even be rated as professional, with all sorts of technical lingo being reiterated throughout the film.<br />The strength of U-571 lies in the suspense build-up. For instance, the scene where death charges were dropping over the U-571 was a good suspense-filled part of the movie.  War tactics employed by the submariners also help to lend a certain quality of intelligence to the whole movie.  After all the ordeal the submariners on U-571 had gone through, I felt proud for them at the finale, that they managed to overcome their enemy.<br />I enjoyed watching this movie - it has good suspense, dynamic action scenes and ultimately not compromising a good, decent storyline. Unless you do not like war films, U-571 should not be missed.
0767019083|4.0|This video truly depicts how for about half a century, the most powerful man in the world was not the President, but Hoover himself.
0767817710|3.0|Being a fan of the spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone and especially a fan of Leone's finest &quot;Once Upon A Time In The West&quot; starring Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson, Jason Robards, and Claudia Cardinale (rent it sometime!), I was really very amused at Sam Raimi's choices of camera shots...they were, of course, taken directly from late 60's film! But, hey, that's okay. The film felt like a tribute and therefore, made it enjoyable to me.<br />My only real problem with the film is Sharon Stone. Don't get me wrong, I actually have a lot of respect for her and have enjoyed performances by her at other times, but she just didn't seem to have the right tone in this movie for me. I would have much preferred for Sam Raimi to make his tribute to the spaghetti western using the other two main characters -- Cort (the unbelievably talented, charismactic, brilliant Russell Crowe) and John Herrod (the also brilliant Gene Hackman). Cort was the most interesting character in the film and Russell really does make the perfect cowboy; Gene Hackman likes to chew up the scenery and a duel between these two is the film I'd like to see!<br />This movie is not a waste of time; but I found myself wishing for what could have been...Do you think Cort would have beaten Herrod, even with his left hand?
B00005B4GU|5.0|Wow. That's pretty much all I can say. Wow. Let me strain for a moment to try to give individual reviews of the songs, even though they all flow together in their own special way. The transition between &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; and &quot;Pulk&quot; is breath-taking. PS is slowing down, after a smooth, orchestral climax...then all of a sudden, BAM! Pulk comes out of nowhere with a stop-start, driving, creepy rhythm. It's like the purpose of that is to wake up the listener after being put in the hypnotic trance of &quot;Pyramid Song&quot;.<br />1.Packt... 10/10 The best opener I've ever heard. It immediately draws you into the album, and when the song ends, leaves you with that craving for more of the album. A fantastic rhythm.<br />2.Pyramid Song 10/10 Quite frankly, the best song since Nirvana's &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;. Piano work that, no BS, is comparable to some of Beethoven's early work.<br />3.Pulk... 10/10 Think about your worst fear...then set it to music. This is Pulk. After listening to this song, you'll be very jumpy.<br />4.You And Whose Army? 9.5/10 Tear-jerking vocals. It'd be perfect if it wasn't short. (3:10)<br />5.I Might Be Wrong 10/10 Catchy and meaningful. Some of the best lyrics I've ever heard. &quot;I used to think there was no future left at all&quot;...<br />6.Knives Out 9.5/10 Just about perfect. Great singing on Thom's part; when you hear him burst into the song with &quot;I want you to know/He's not coming back&quot;, it's an auralgasm.<br />7.Morning Bell/Amnesiac 9/10 The lowest-scoring song on the album, and I rated it a 9! Just goes to show how great this album is. A song from a previous album, just remixed a little.<br />8.Dollars &amp; Cents 10/10 Unlike any other song I've ever heard...how can you describe D&amp;C? I'll leave that to another reviewer.<br />9.Hunting Bears 9.5/10 A 2-minute guitar/organ instrumental in the vain of Pink Floyd...perfect for relaxing to.<br />10.Like Spinning Plates 10/10 Most experimentalthing I've ever heard...it makes me cry every time I hear it.<br />11.Life In A Glass House 10/10 I'm gushing with perfect scores, and for good reason. A tear-jerking jazz/piano combo with Thom singing his heart out...best jazz arrangement ever. Yes, I know there's a lot of &quot;best-ever&quot; awards I'm slapping on these songs, but I truly mean it. At the end, Thom is reduced to a whimper. &quot;There's someone listening iiiiiiin&quot;. One final horn trumpet and it's all over.<br />Buy it.
B00004RFDW|5.0|I truly think this is a great film. I don't say that often. Sitting down and watching and feeling this movie is an experience.<br />I should have known Michael Mann directed. I was a great fan of Miami Vice many moons ago, and didn't realize until halfway through the Insider that Mann was responsible. But it made sense -- the music plays such a crucial role. Mann succeeds at creating a psychological, mood film that is quite riveting to me. I really don't want to get long-winded about all the wonderful, wonderful scenes (hotel room, golf range, CBS offices, outside Wigand's house at night, the long parade of cars going to the deposition, Wigand's return from the deposition, on and on...).<br />I think this movie is perfect from beginning to end. Pacino's hair-raising speech, &quot;are we newsmen or businessmen?&quot; is priceless and Russell Crowe, is, as I've come to see after watching many of his films now, an absolutely brilliant actor. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant!<br />Sit down, get quiet, and watch this movie -- really watch it. Take the time to enjoy a visual and auditory feast.

0671042858|5.0|I cannot believe that Stephen King could write a book like this. It certainly shows his softer side-- definitely is not a horror story--almost spiritual in its rendering.<br />I have not read any of King's books in the last 10 years, but this sounded different, and it certainly was! I had to restrain myself, over and over again, from reading the ending early (something I never do). It was such a gripping story....I felt every bump and bruise and pain that nine-year-old Trisha McFarland, lost in the northeast woods, felt as she tried to find her way back to civilization.<br />King's rendering of the thoughts of this child, her terror, her spirit, and her resourcefulness were right on target. I felt myself growing increasingly anxious as Trisha wandered in the woods, trying desperately not only to survive but to stay sane. Good writing...no dialogue and essentially only one character, which must be a difficult kind of book to write; but despite this, the story never lagged. It was fast and easy reading.<br />Like Paul Watkins' \\"Archangel\\" and Jean Hegland's \\"Into the Forest\\",  the forest was a character in the novel as much as was any human.

B000000H5K|4.0|I just bought this yesterday and i thought it was pretty good but a little messed up. The lyrics are unclear and the music pretty distored. I still liked it alot though especially the first song roots bloody roots.... At least the band made up for it by haveing the Great Jason Newstead in against. Well I think this was a good album but I think Nation and Chaos are much better. But dont hesitate to buy this album its much better than max's soul fly attempt, even though soul fly is a really good band, and a hell of alot better than any of slipknots stuff too.
B00003CXP1|5.0|while I respect Soderberg's work and found Traffic to be a relatively compelling piece, it can't hold a candle to Requiem in terms of truly conveying the highs and lows of drug addiction. This film is NOT for everyone, but those looking for a truly complete, original movie experience can't go wrong here. Ellen Burstyn gives the performance of three lifetimes, Chris McDonald is great as always in a small role, and I'll never look at my refrigerator in quite the same way again. HIGHLY recommended.
B00005B4GU|4.0|I've had this album for about 24 hours, and clearly it will take a long while to digest. I recall the band saying that this album would be &quot;more mainstream&quot; than Kid A -- they lied. Although the albums are quite different, they're cut from the same cloth. And, like with Kid A, it's an album I'll have to live with for awhile before I can really form an opinion.<br />However, I'd like to share my initial thoughts for those wavering on the edge of buying the album. Amnesiac, sadly, does not hold together as an album nearly as well as Kid A or OK Computer or even The Bends. Those albums had more of a cohesive thread running through, or at least a more obvious one.<br />On the plus side, it is immediately obvious that Pyramid Song is the best piece that Radiohead's ever done. It's an amazing song, with all the ingredients of classic Radiohead - dreamy lyrics, haunting melody, dense layers of sound. The stumbling piano melody, Thom's voice, the drums when they kick in, and the wonderful string arrangement, add up to a track that's well worth the price of the album all on its own. You and Whose Army is another memorable song, with Thom muttering about &quot;holy Roman empire&quot; and &quot;you and your cronies&quot; and wailing out the last minute or so of the music over a pounding drum beat, quite like a death march. Also good additions to the Radiohead ouvre, in their own ways, are tracks 1 and 6, Packed Like Sardines.. and Knives Out. <br />Unfortunately, that's just what this album is: a collection of songs, some good and some perfectly fine, but not quite adding up to a whole. It's nice to hear Johnny get a song to himself, Hunting Bears, but is a guitar instrumental really necessary in the place they put it? Like Spinning Plates is an amusing exercise in sound techniques, what with the backwards effects and all, but it's not really called for either. Perhaps with time I'll be able to decipher a pattern out of the muddle, but until then I'm just enjoying the parts without quite coming up with a whole.
1878424114|5.0|Of all the books I own, this slim volume has been the most formative in my life.  Laid on my pillow one crucial night, its wisdom provided both beacon and lifeline.<br />Later, I distilled its seven chapters into a computer-generated poster for my bulletin board.  Within that poster's oval border rotate the &quot;laws&quot; and my paraphrasing of their essence.  For example:  &quot;Pure Potentiality&quot;--Take time to be silent.  Commune with nature.  Practice non-judgment.  &quot;Detachment&quot;--Allow yourself and others to be as they are.  Don't force solutions.  Accept uncertainty as the path to freedom.  Remain open to an infinity of choices.   And so on.  <br />These are but sample touchstones.  The guidebook itself is the precious gem.  For full understanding, read and re-read the charismatic words of Dr. Deepak Chopra, who, better than anyone, has popularized and made accessible to the Western mind the timeless wisdom of India.<br />All of Deepak's writings are worth your time, attention, and money.  But if you must buy only ONE Chopra book, let it be this one.
B00003CX95|5.0|I think this movie really captured the story of Braveheart and his rebellion against the English. Though there were some things altered for sake of entertainment, this movie is a historical epic worthy of your income. It is long and garuntees good watching for people of any genre.<br />If you are the action type who loves big battles, this is your movie. Those who like longer, more plot-filled movies will also enjoy this. Those who are a combo will definetely enjoy this movie. The story of William Wallace is interesting in reality, but this movie makes it interesting for those that disagree.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|As a true-blue fan of musical theater, I didn't have high expectations for &quot;Moulin Rouge.&quot;  However, after seeing the film three times and buying the soundtrack, I can firmly say that it is the best movie I've seen in a long time, probably since &quot;American Beauty.&quot;  This movie has it all, from fantastic visuals to tremendous music, and this soundtrack is a perfect complement to the film.  Ewan's and Nicole's lack of vocal experience is EASILY overlooked when you hear the sheer humanity in their voices.  All of the major musical moments are on this CD, with a few exceptions, which is my only complaint.  It is nice to hear some of the songs in their true expanded format (&quot;Lady Marmalade,&quot; and &quot;Rhythm of the Night&quot; are really very brief in the film), yet I hope a second volume is forthcoming with the actual mixes used in the film, and some of the other numbers (including the hilariously campy &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;).  But until then, we'll have to suffer through with this CD -- NOT!  BUY IT RIGHT NOW! :)
B00005B4GU|4.0|For the record, I am a huge fan of Radiohead (ps. I'm going to see them in Houston..). But for some reason, I had a little mixed feeling about this record. <br />Some songs are very captivating, I especially enjoy the first song with the kettle drum intro and interesting production on the vocals and music. Also, &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot; sees the guitars coming back into play for the band, with a grungy, older Pearl Jam-ish riff. Radiohead still know how to put in a good melody. &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; is a dreamy, lush piano landscape that evokes images of an ocean, which fits the video for the song also. &quot;Pulk/pull Revolving Doors&quot; features an intese and equally primal drumfest that is very satisfying, and the song is kept varied by occasional instrumental breaks. Songs like these and &quot;Life in a Glass House&quot; make for a good listen.<br />However, the only thing holding me back from giving this album an immediate 5 is how bored or tired the band sounds on the record. For example, it sounds like &quot;You and Whose Army?&quot; was recorded right after Thom woke up after a long night. His exhausted whelps bothered me. Also, &quot;Knives Out&quot;, despite containing a very engaging chord progression, seems like it's played with disinterest in the guitars. I would love to hear the guitars stand out more in this song. I don't dislike these songs, but they could have used more pomp in certain areas.<br />The only thing I really dislike about the album is the alternate version of &quot;Morning Bell&quot;. In the previous recording featured on Kid A, it was one of my favorite tracks, because it was sparse and showcased Thom's voice very nicely. The more instrumental version offered on Amnesiac seems cluttered, and doesn't seem to fit well compared to the other tracks. <br />So now, we leave the &quot;Kid A recording sessions&quot;. It was a fantastic trip. Since the stylistic shift from Ok Computer to the Kid A session was so great, it makes me wonder where the band is headed now. Radiohead is the band to keep your eye on in the new millenium. This album is worth the price of admission, but it seems that Kid A is the stronger of the two from this time.
B00005B4GU|4.0|As the title of my review suggests, this music is definitely not for the masses listening to the boring, repetitive litter on the airwaves.  Radiohead have once again created something that could so easily be written off as electronic fluff and experitmentation, but, is actually a work of depth and substance not found in most of today's music.  And that, as in all Radiohead albums, is where the genius of Amnesiac lies.  With each listen the music unfolds itself like a strange alien landscape that is at first disturbing but soon becomes oddly soothing.  I do not believe there is a real message to the music, or that Radiohead are trying to show the listener just how far they can take rock . . . instead, I think Amnesiac is a musical catalyst for our minds . . . Radiohead give us a springboard to fill in the empty spaces, the amnesia, in our own minds . . . in a nutshell, Amnesiac will be as weak or as powerful as the listener wants to make it.
6305807930|4.0|Many reviewers have already pointed out strengths and weaknesses of this one-of-a-kind film, so let me stop at adding a few points. First, it is true that INFERNO dispenses with the murder-mystery angle and therefore can be potentially confusing and frustrating for a viewer looking for any dramatic logic in the character behavior. However, if one comes right down to it, Hitchcock's VERTIGO is also full of plot holes, its characters do not act sensibly or rationally, and the film ends in a bizarre, &quot;that's all?!&quot; manner as well.  But no serious connoisseur of modern cinema would accuse VERTIGO of making no sense, right?  From the very first frame of the film INFERNO announces that it is a largely soundstage-bound, expressionist cinema where color schemes of a composition shot could be far more important than the dialogues. I do not mean to suggest that the narrative of INFERNO is not confusing. It is, but other strengths outweigh its shortcomings in acting, characterization and dramaturgy. The &quot;Three Mothers&quot; premise I think also works quite well; it adds interesting dimensions to the gory killings and supernatural goings-on, without explaining away the &quot;motivations&quot; of the culprits as in an ordinary giallo thriller. There is a genuine sense of mystery and foreboding to the entire proceedings.  All in all, INFERNO could have been easily superior to SUSPIRIA, BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE and even DEEP RED,(It is still, in my opinion, in an altogether different class from TENEBRAE or PHENOMENA) but there are a few glaring false steps taken by Argento that prevent it from being his true masterpiece.  I will just mention one of them: the whole bit involving Kazanian (wonderfully played by Sacha Pitoeff, to be sure), cats and rats.  Now don't get me wrong, I am NOT objecting to this out of any politically-correct animal-rights sensibility.  But the entire sequence is simply out of sync with the rest of the film, its tone is completely off, and is pointlessly (as opposed to effectively) nasty.  And as one reviewer mentioned, what's with the hotdog vendor?! Can Three Mothers assume male forms as well?  Okay, so TOO MUCH confusion is not good after all...nd is pointlessly (as opposed to effectively) nasty.  And as one reviewer mentioned, what's with the hotdog vendor?!

B0000026UL|5.0|The lyrics are powerful.  The music is soothing.  I've listened to this cd hundreds of times and I'm still not tired of it.  Definatly an upgrade from the Dylan of the 60's.  He even sings good :)
B00004T9UF|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS TRUE HIP HOP. IT IS NOT A HYPE ALBUM IT IS JUST PLAIN GREAT A CLASSIC. ... IF YOU ARE TRUE TO HIP HOP THEN BUY THIS NOW AND LISTEN TO HOW HE PUTS WORDS TOGETHER AND HOW HE CAN JUST MAKE SOME OF THE BEST RYHMES EVER!!!! THE PRODUCTION IS AMAZING................WHAT CAN I SAY JUST BUY IT!!!!!!!out for all to see; the offensive opinions are simply the device he uses to communicate the dominating emotion of his life - anger.  That is why his music is so popular and so good, because it is grounded in an emotion that we can relate to, as well as an expression that we all know.  We all feel angry and we all vent it by blaming the world around us, and The Marshall Mathers LP recognizes both the personal and universal aspects of anger and blame, as Eminem rants against personal and societal demons viciously and with a great deal of talent.  Therein lies the most important key to enjoying this album; recognize the talent.  As with any message, the judgment of whether it is offensive or not is in the hands of the person receiving the message.  What cannot be debated, however, is how well the message is delivered.  Sit back and, if you can, turn off your reactions to the words and listen to the raw emotion and sheer talent displayed on the most influential (if not necessarily the best) album of 2000.s. He isn't selling this stuff door to door or force feeding anyone his veiws and ryhmes. We aren't that lucky.em has paid his  dues.  He's done drugs, gotten into fights, made an obscene record, gotten  arrested, gotten a huge stinkin' pile of publicity from MTV/TRL.  So that  makes him a REAL ARTIST.  What more do you want him to do to convince you  to buy this cd?  Actually have some artistic talent?  PLEASE!  <br />Eminem's  not twisted.  YOU ARE if you don't immediately charge up your credit card  and buy ten copies of this Marshall Mathers cd to hand out a Xmas.  That  way, you and your friends and family can gather round, hold hands, and rap  along with Em - insulting everyone on God's green earth and making yourself  look like an idiot in the process.  Share the joy!  Its your right and duty  as American citizens!  FINALLY, prove what a hardcore stud you are to  everyone who questions your ability to &quot;be a man&quot; and &quot;keep  it real.&quot; Because if you destroy others, as long as the beat is  strong, that is what makes you a man after all. You betta ask somebody!  (Oops, looks like I forgot to change this review to a five star rating.   Because this sure is some high-quality rappin.')  Oh well...BUY THE CD*BUY  THE CD*BUY THE CD*BUY THE CD*BUY THE CD*BUY THE CD*BUY THE CD!HE CD*BUY THE CD*BUY THE CD*BUY THE CD*BUY THE CD!

B000000H4V|5.0|wow, what can i say, this is one of the best metal albums to come out during the metal revival of the early and mid 90's.. this one rocks.  Fast, hard, with purpose, this is Sep's finest.
0385501560|4.0|Chuck P. is truly one of the best authors of our time and I believe I have said this enough in my three previous reviews of his novels, so I'll cut through the mustard on this one.  Choke is smart and entertaining and very, very visceral, just like you'd expect a Palahniuk novel to be.  However, the story and characters all seem to be echoes of each other ffrom his other stories and it sometimes gets tiring.  I understand that Palahniuk is very angried about the world we live in, but every single subplot in all of his stories is about destroying materialism and creating ourselves anew.  While I have no problem with this, as he does it so very well, I must admit that it is sometimes a little tiring even though it doesn't effect the quality of this book.<br />Many, many things in this novel are genius, including Palahniuk's view of how everything can be an addiction, even picking up rocks.  The impacted gut subplot is gross, yet funny at the same time and works well with the nihilism of the main character.  Also, I don't know why Hollywood hasn't tapped this guy to write endings, but Palahniuk can truly write some of the most brilliant and twisting endings ever.  He never dissapoints with his twists, and this novel is no exception.<br />Overall, Choke is another great book and great story, but if you've read his previous work, the implications and satire will seem a little old, but the wit is still some of the best around.
B00000J6AG|2.0|Moby chose samples dripping with soul, and threw sterile beats around them.  The work was already done for him.  He didn't write a lot of this, he just arranged cute little sound collages.  Yee haw.  This record should come off as blasphemous, but it is just an honest, silly record.
0881032646|5.0|Athrur C. Clarkes' ChildHoods End is quite a compelling read.  There were many twist and turns in the novel but what I found fascinating was the &quot;Overlords true forms&quot; and why we feared them (People who have read it will know what I mean) and The Higher Intelligence that the &quot;Overlords&quot; serve.  Also the scientific studies that the Overlords conduct on themselves is interesting also.  The book is a simple read but at the same time is incredibly thought provoking.  What exactly is the Higher Intelligence? I enjoyed it but was a bit spooked because I am a Christian (You have to read it).
B00005BJC7|4.0|I have mixed feelings about this album. It feels like what was laying around after the best tracks were given to Kid A. Is that the point? Is this some kind of elaborate metaphor about one getting more than the other from uneven parenting? I am reading too far into it though perhaps. <br />Amnesiac is, though, an uneven collage of tracks. It&#8217;s not so much an issue of consistency as much as it seems like I&#8217;m just out of context, and maybe even out of phase. At any rate, there is something here that eludes explanation, other than to say that Amnesiac is nothing like Kid A. So what is the problem? Exactly my point. (Scratches head).  I suppose that&#8217;s the consequence of thinking I had a good handle on the direction Radiohead was heading. Shame on me? Hmm, perhaps.<br />Fans, purchase at your own risk. One mans diamond is another mans highly refined lump of carbon. This album is challenging. It&#8217;s like being lost in the forest. There are many little nooks and crannies that reward exploration, and other bits that just confuse. It&#8217;s very confrontational, rich, deep, and layered. I am glad I own it, but others may not agree. Whatever.<br />Another reviewer made an excellent point about this limited addition copy. I'll let you find it though. The limited addition is worth the extra money, but...these last two projects could easily have been fused, and there would be no need for a limited edition. Guess I fail economics 101 in Record Company academics. Boo hoo. Do what you will.
B00003CXSP|4.0|reviews are ok but, sometimes they tell too much. By this I mean, they tell too much that when you do see the movie you are anticipating what you read instead of being totally surprised. I would ask that you not tell as much. Leave more for the imagination.  Good idea though.
B00004XONN|2.0|I love Radiohead's first 3 cds. But Kid A is too damn spaced out for me. I gave it away.
B00005B6N8|1.0|Pitch Black was by far the worst movie I've ever seen. Not only were the actors terrible and annoying, but the plot stank. 22 years before they crash landed on the deserted planet, there was an eclipse. Somehow this triggers the girl to think that there will be an eclipse the exact time there one the planet. If there was an earthquake 5 years ago in Cali. that doesn't mean there's one every 5 years. Simply a stupid plot. The only decent thing about the movie was Vin Diesel. Except for the fact that somehow he knows everything about the killer bugs on the planet. PLEASE save your money and get something better than this trash.
B00005B4GU|3.0|Recently, awesome bands have been putting out less than awesome material, weezer, tool, now radiohead is giving us something that isnt bad, but isnt better than the last, in this case im ignoring Kid A and Im saying if you have ok computer, and you love it, you can buy amnesiac, but its nothing spectacular so you really dont have to.
B000059PPN|5.0|Made when Fulci was healthy and on a roll, the House by the Cemetery is one of his best hands down.  If you loved Zombies 2, the Gates of Hell, or the Beyond, you will go nuts for this hilarious gore drenched masterpiece.  Fulci returns to America to shoot one of his bloodiest (not too much gore, just blood) shockers and comes away beaming.  A great buy for anyone who is mesmorized by the godfather of gore or hardcore Italian horror from the 1980's.  Not as upscale as the Beyond, House by the Cemetery is something to own.  Don't call yourself a Fulci fan unless you own and love this film.  THis is what it's all about!!!  Just look at the intro, the best out of any Fulci film [....]

B00003CXN3|5.0|Steven Soderbergh's film about the war on drugs goes above and beyond a good film. It starts out in Mexico. Two cops Javier Rodriguez Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) and Manolo Sanchez (Jacob Vargas) sit in their car waiting for a shipment of drugs. After confrunting the suspected drug transporters. General Salazar (Tomas Milian) rides in and takes all the credit. However he would like to talk with Rodriguez sometime, so he can help him fight the war against the cocaine cartels. But the cartels seem to be unbeatable!    Later the film shifts to Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) who is the Ohio Supreme Court Justice. Wakefield has just been selected by the President to take over as the U.S. drug czar. But the real enemy is his daughter Caroline (Erika Christensen) who likes to get high with her friends (mainly) Seth Abrahms (Topher Grace)at any spare moment. Caroline quickly becomes a drug addict.    Last but not least we go to San Diego. Here two DEA undercover cops Montel Gordon (Don Cheadle) and Ray Castro (Luis Guzman) are trying to put the stick to Eduardo Ruiz (Miguel Ferrer) who is the key witness in bringing down Carlos Ayala (Steven Bauer)who is a wealthy man. Who can be put away by Ruiz. But Carlos pregnant wife, Helena (Catherine Zeta-Jones) quickly adapts after a brief shock to her husbands &quot;second job&quot; by taking over while he is in jail. So she can save their business and way of life.  Soderbergh's film shows that crime is a huge business, and to get wrapped up into it is easier, than to get out! There is someone out there that wants the drug and will do what it takes to get it. In return the drug-lords get more powerful and will not let anything stop them to get there product onto the market. Won well deserved Oscar's for (Best Director-Soderbergh,Supporting Actor,-Del Toro,Adapted Screenplay and Editing.) Traffic remains one of the best films I have ever seen! Grade:A
B000000OYQ|5.0|This albumn (strangely) works. Robert Plant's vocals on &#34;The Only One&#34; are quite moving and some of Jimmy's guitar work is rather innovative. The drumming is no where near Zeppelin's standard and the vocals are (at times) awkward. Jimmy's blues solos still rip however and at times we find ourselves back in the good old days.
0792106989|5.0|John Ford's last great film united him once again with the greatest star of all time, John Wayne! The film is about James Stewart as a tenderfoot lawyer who falls in love with a young women (Vera Miles.) The thing is John Wayne also has a thing for her. However James and Vera get married and leave town. When Wayne dies they return to pay there last respect. (The film starts out with him already dead.) James tells his life story to the towns newspaper. The only reason that James lived was because he had to shoot Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin-in one of his best performances). But the thing that is most important is that Wayne is the one that helped save Stewart. With Wayne's tough guy personality and Stewarts nice-guy style. Both combine to make a memorable film. Look quickly for Lee Van Cleef as one of Marvin's gang members. The last great film by one of Hollywood's biggest legends. John Ford! Remember that &quot;When The Legend Becomes Fact, Print The Legend&quot; Grade:B+
B00005BJC7|5.0|How amazing... From Pablo Honey to Amnesiac, Radiohead have done nothing but progressing with their talent. Amnesiac is a fantastic album with eleven pieces of art.<br />It starts with an intro witch is telling you that it is going to be a huge mix of electro rock-jazzy kind of music, The sounds of their instruments doesn't seem the same , but does... Thom's voice is always a bit back grounded, witch make the music more powerfull. This is a must have album...     I announce it album of the year....     pommeh
0671449028|5.0|This book is wonderful.  I love rhyming text and this goes through the process of getting ready for bed in a dreamy, sing-song way.  I love this book.  It was one of the few that I didn't mind reading to my daughter over and over and over.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Baz Luhrmann was never a popular director of mine. While people in my high school loved his take on Romeo and Juliet, I turned away.  i preffered my Shakespeare classics just the way they were.   Then, when I heard about Moulin Rouge, I became entranced by the concept, and after seeing the film, it is truly spectacular!      Following Christian (Ewan McGregor), we start at the end as he tells us of the beginning, as he moves to Paris to take part in the Bohemian art movement.  He quickly meets the dwarf named Toulouse LaTrec (John Leguizamo, acting on his knees), and they set out along with Toulouse's friends, to try and get Satine (Nicole Kidman), one of the best of the Moulin Rouge's dancers, to be in their production.  After a mishap of mistaken identity, Satine realizes she has fallen in love with Christian.  However, this poses a problem to her manager Zeigler (Jim Broadbent), who wants to turn the Moulin Rouge into a theater.  However, the financeer, The Duke of Worcester, will owe his services on 2 conditions: 1-that Zeigler signs off the Moulin Rouge to him, and 2-that he makes it so that Satine is officially his.  This leads to many struggles of the characters as Christian and Satine try to be close to one another while not trying to let the Duke know.      Luhrmann also succeeds well in choosing the music for his musical.  Yes, this is a mus-i-call!!  Not since \\"Dancer in the Dark\\" have such sounds sounded so wonderful!  I actually bought the soundtrack.  But here are some notable areas of interest:<br />1. Nirvana's \\"Smells like Teen Spirit,\\" though being sung by a number of 30-60 year old gentelmen in suits and top hats at the Moulin Rouge.<br />2.Zeigler's rendition of \\"Like a Virgin\\" to cover for Satine's absence one night.  The performance is hilarious!!<br />3.The pitch-to get out of a jam, Christian, Satine, Zeigler, Toulouse and his bunch, stage an interesting sales pitch to the Duke, to the tune of the Can-Can.  The number is so arousing, I actually applauded as soon as it ended!<br />4.Tango Du Roxanne- 2 stories being told to an 80's song done in tango.  Feelings are played with, emotions are mixed: very powerful!<br />  There are plenty more, but you must see it for yourself!  I am a wacky, weird, artist type, and can easily say that I enjoyed it very much. There are many quick camera cuts here and there, but they work surprisingly well, and Baz does a waltzing on the clouds almost straight out of my imagination!  Take a friend or someone you love to see this.  Remember: Truth, Beauty, Freedom, and above all things: Love!
0679460063|5.0|This book is certainly one of Patricia Cornwell's best because the way she integrates the use of the Internet and a extinct virus.  Scarpetta is challenged to the hilt with the landfill case because of the complications involved with her rival Percy Ring and the leaks of the information.  The way Scarpetta is challenged is a credit to the author.  Scarpetta's niece Lucy is an excellent addition because she really can get under the skin of the reader and make them think that she is talking to them instead of her aunt.  My favorite part is where Scarpetta finds herself in a situation that she has never been in before and that is where she is unsure if she has contacted this virus or not.
0140434267|5.0|I have always loved the style and social politics of the Regency period (the time of Jane Austen.) But when I read &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; in 7th grade I found the first few chapters lifeless, dull and hard to read. Two years later I was encouraged by a friend to give &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; a try. I did and have since become a complete Janeite. I am now able to peruse joyfully through &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; with a new understanding and appreciation of Jane Austen. The reason? &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is fresh, witty and is a great introduction to Jane Austen's writing style without the formality of some of her other novels (unlike S&amp;S and Persuasion Austen does not give us a 10 page history of each family and their fortune.) If you have never read Jane Austen or have read her other novels and found them boring, read Pride and Prejudice. The characters, and the situations Austen presents to them, are hysterical and reveal a lot about Regency society and morality. This book perfectly compliments a great writer like Jane Austen and is essential to every reader's library. The Penguin Edition of the book is stellar and I personally recommend it not only for the in-depth and indispensable footnotes, but also for the cover that is non-suggestive of any of the characters' appearances. In summary &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is a great book for beginner Austen readers and seasoned fans, and Penguin Classics is a great edition for fully enjoying and understanding the book.
B00005B4GU|1.0|Kid A was a great CD, but not Radiohead. Not only is this CD not the Radiohead we all know and love, but it is nearly unlistenable. Radiohead has every right to go off on this musical tangent. Just as their fans have the right not to purchase this dreck as I, unfortunately, did.  Save your money until the real Radiohead stands up.  If this is the permanent direction of Radiohead, then I accuse them of killing off potentially one of the greatest rock bands in history.
B000003TAR|5.0|this album, In Utero, i would say is the best nirvana cd, with the most diversity. Nevermind, a close second,  is also a fabulous cd and i would recommend both of them. Despite not being the greatest role model, Kurt Cobain in my opinion is the most talented vocalist ever. Excuse me....WAS the most talented vocalist ever.  He's just got his own sound, that no other singer can surpass. My personal favorite tracks on this album are Heart-Shaped Box, Dumb, and All Apologies. I only wish that nirvana would have made more &quot;light&quot; songs such as All Apologies instead of mostly singing harder rockin' songs (which i like as well). I highly suggest that you purchase this cd, it is a must have for your collection along with Nevermind.
6305313687|5.0|Some people complain that this movie glorifies racism and neo-Nazism.  The glorification is to show the audience why this ideology is so attractive and that people get caught up in it for reasons other than that they are stupid (as Norton's character was quite intelligent) or evil.  To fight and prevent hate, one must understand why the hate exists. This movie is incredible in telling the tale of one man's realization that the racism he adopted just gave him more problems.  Avery Brooks's character points out that he too pursued an ideology of hate earlier in his life (showing the film's rejection of ALL ideologies of hate) solved none of his problems and forces Edward Norton's character to admit the same. The actors in this film played their parts brilliantly.  Special kudos to Edward Norton who played the role of Derek Vinyard with a chilling power and charisma.  Definitely one of my favorite actors. This is not a one-dimensional shrill call against racism.  It is a powerful, complex indictment of the destruction that hate causes to society, one's family, and one's self.  Watch it with an open, honest mind.

B0000542DJ|5.0|&quot;JFK&quot; is one of those movies that I love, but somehow it irritates me.  When I say irritate, I mean that it doesn't give me a clear-cut answer to the big question that encompasses this three hour film,&quot;Who killed Kennedy?&quot;.  What you're given are ideas and theories to who did the deed, but never a clear-cut answer.  Even the ending doesn't appear to be that hopeful.  But in the analysis, that's what makes the movie appealing.  It gives you the ideas to work with, then leaves them for you to put together.  Movies like this are generally never taken very well by mainstream audiences, but (as in the case with this film) &quot;JFK&quot; managed to renew interest in the assassination and bring some interesting facts to light.  The commentary by director Oliver Stone on this Special Edition DVD is not just about the film, but about the conspiracy theories, his disgust at current events, and general facts about this period of time that has seem to affect a good deal of his movies.  Also included are some interesting outtakes/deleted scenes and some features on events involving key players and the assassination itself.  The movie itself is full of great performers such as Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Joe Pesci, Gary Oldman, Donald Sutherland, Jack Lemmon, and many others.  It's a film that strikes a nerve and is truly one of the best movies the 1990's has ever produced.  Period.
B00005B4GU|5.0|This album has a lot of great and memorable songs as &quot;I Might be Wrong&quot;, with it's excellent guitar riff; &quot;Knifes Out&quot; a great guitar song, and much more. This is my favorite cd at the moment, so buy it you wont regret it.
B00001U0DP|1.0|If you saw Benigni at the Oscars, grandstanding, goofing off, doing more than any WWF wrestler has ever done to attract attention to himself, that would be be a good gauge to see if you will like this movie.  If you thought that was acceptible behavior (but would you allow your children to act like that? -NO!)and found it charming, you will like the movie.  If you found Benigni's behavior to be altogether deplorable and completely lacking in any humorous content, you will hate this movie.  Forget about any other factor - this movie is pure Benigni - the plot, cast, setting, are practically irrelevant to whether you would enjoy the movie.<br />Having said that, the plot in this movie is horrible - Benigni making a game out of being interned in a Nazi concentration camp for his young son to spare him the horrors of the Holocaust.  It is so ridiculously implausible that it boggles the mind how people can enjoy his meanderings around the camp without getting caught by the guards.  Imagine if the producers of Hogan's Heroes tried to keep everything exactly the same, but make it a heavy drama instead. It just doesn't work.<br />Regardless of what platitudes others have said about the lightness of the human spirit, the originality of the story, the power of love,...... Blech! this movie simply makes a mockery of the Holocaust.  It is shameful.<br />Most Americans do not like children acting out and being ridiculous.  Most Americans are happy to throw Jerry Lewis to the French and then mock them for their lack of taste.  Most Americans switch channels when Carrot Top is the guest on Leno.  Most Americans cringe horribly at the thought of putting a needle full of heroin into their own vein.  So why are there so many five star reviewers out there?
B000001FAW|5.0|After the enormous come-back sucess of &quot;Main Course&quot;, the Gibbs' followed with this album and the #1 'across the charts' hit &quot;You Should Be Dancing&quot;.  Arif Mardin could not produce for them again, due to record contractual conflicts.  But, at the same time, Billboard magazine had just started a &quot;dance&quot; chart and this single topped it the summer of 1976. Followed closely to #3 was &quot;Love So Right&quot;, a severe 'Stylistics' sound copy.  &quot;Boogie Child&quot; surprised everyone with it's complex instrumental backing and the funkadelic vocals.<br />It was another step up for the Bee Gees.  Again, with too many hits to release in a year, other artists like Melba Moore &quot;You Stepped Into My Life&quot; and an old Gibb friend Yvonne Elliman, &quot;Love Me&quot;, snatched these songs up and made them their own giant hits.  Radio Host Casey Kasem remarked during the showcasing of &quot;Love So Right&quot;, that the Bee Gees have had more songs copied by any other artists, other than the Beatles! This was in 1976 before &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;.!<br />The title track made a big hit in Europe and several other tracks became concert staples.  Who knew that the next studio album would be the biggest selling soundtrack of all time?<br />&quot;Children Of The World&quot; is another amazing groundbreaker.  History will probably never repeat itself like this again.
B00003CXRM|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  The Coen brothers did it again!  I had begun to dismiss George Clooney as just another pretty boy playing the same roles over and over again.  But after seeing him play his unique character in this well crafted film, I rethought that dismissal.  He was fantastic as was John Turturo and the rest of the talented cast.  &quot;We thought you wuz a toad&quot; and &quot;Well, ain't this a geographical oddity&quot; are just a few of the lines that will make you roll with laughter--you'll see what I mean when you see the movie!
B000001FE0|4.0|Yes, this was the Bee Gees 'white' album, only this doubled LP had a red velvet cover and a 'Titanic'-like illustration in the gatefold.  Now available on a single CD, it marks the end of the sixties period for the Bee Gees.<br />The music?  This was an important time for the Gibbs' who were maturing (at ages 19 and 21) and already millionaires.  The music was conceptual and starting with the title track, it delivers with powerful orchestration and emotional, lyrical simplicity.  It is a skewed look at a fabled seafarer lost at sea and emotionally destitute.  At least, that's what the project started out to be.<br />Somewhere during the recordings, egos flared and tempers snapped, so what you ended up with is a collection of half Bee Gees conceptual songs and half individual Gibb contributions.  It is still a remarkable recording!<br />Stand-out cuts are &quot;Marley Purt Drive&quot; that could have been recorded by &quot;The Band&quot; and &quot;Melody Fair&quot;, a single in some countries and a well covered track.<br />Most of the other tracks deal with period issues like, drugs, sex, rock 'n roll, psychodelia and why not?  Producer Stigwood unwittingly fueled the tensions by choosing &quot;First Of May&quot; as the A-Side single instead of B-Side &quot;Lamplight&quot;, which was just as strong.<br />Regardless, the final outcome is a conceptual album filled with an orchestrally sweeping moodiness aligned with perfect harmonies and lyrics envied by everyone. This is one of the few albums of the period with orchestral solos with the Gibbs providing the chorus.  It is monumental.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Word of mouth was that Moulin Rouge was confusing, surreal, and not very good, but when a friend of mine invited me to see it along with one of the original Disney animators, I went, although with misgivings. I started work at Warner Brothers in 1962 on My Fair Lady, and over the years, have worked on such films as Mary Poppins, and TV shows such as the A-Team (5 Yrs) Beverly Hills 90210 (4 Yrs) and will shortly begin my 7th year on NYPD Blue. I have seen many special effects (I worked on StarTrek, Superman, etc.) but I have never seen the likes of the cinematography, art direction, minatures, make-up, costuming, and special effects exhibited by Moulin Rouge....and, wait, Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor actually have the talent not only to act, but to do their own singing? My God, if this picture doesn't win at LEAST 6 Oscars, then the Motion Picture Academy is not doing its job....ie. this is one of the most spectacular films I have ever seen in my nearly 30 years of working on the sets of Hollywood at every major studio. My hats off to Twentieth Century Fox and the talented people that brought the miracle of Moulin Rouge to the silver screen. Dave Collier I.A.T.S.E Grip CS, Sound,&amp; Lighting, and SAG member
B00005B4GU|2.0|Radiohead must think they signed a Faustian contract when they became corporate rock fodder. Kid A, with its absence of easy-to-whistle tunes and good, old fashioned riffery, was clear indication of this. These nice middle-class blokes from Oxford don't want stadiums of glow sticks held aloft (a la Bon Jovi's recent shows in Japan). Rather, they want to be left alone in the studio to noodle about, break formulas, and experiment. In other words, they want to be obscure indie kids again.<br />Recorded at the same time as Kid A, Amnesiac is more of the same by way of being different. The central question remains how original and inspired Radiohead really are. In their mania not to retread a single footstep, several of the tracks come across as either mutilated or aborted. &quot;Pyramid Song,&quot; which has beautiful melodic elements, is kept permanently off kilter in an attempt to stop it sounding too nice. Eventually it collapses into the sonic equivalent of Thom Yorke banging his head against the wall and crying. As for abortions, &quot;Hunting Bears&quot; plays around with some beautiful grainy guitar textures, but, in true Eno-esque style, doesn't go anywhere, and could pass as an outtake of a sound check.<br />As expected, there are touches of real talent. &quot;You and Whose Army,&quot; a crowd favorite from the Kid A tour, starts all sad and subterranean, but instead of turning into another dirge, guitars - a real novelty for Radiohead these days - chime in and Yorke's vocal takes off, creating a soaring tour de force of cranked up angst. This and &quot;Knives Out,&quot; another straightforward rock effort, should keep fans and record company on board a little while longer as the SS Radiohead continues its erratic voyage in search of a commercial iceberg.
B00004VWA7|5.0|In the mid-70s, punk obliterated prog-rock.  Many teenage lads like myself jumped ship and discovered there was innovation by the bucketload going on in the controversial jazz-rock field.  Though there were many groups challenging in the first division -- such as Nucleus, the Eleventh House, Isotope, the Mahavishnu Orchestra and the Brecker Brothers -- the arena seemed to me to be dominated by two bands: Corea's Return to Forever, and Shorter &amp; Zawinul's Weather Report.  Besides recording an annual group album, the individual members (and ex-members) of these two bands could issue up to ten solo albums each year between them.<br />Weather Report was notorious for the instability of its rhythm section, and Joe Zawinul could hire and fire several percussionists during one of Wayne Shorter's increasingly rare sax solos.  Whether you include or ignore the mysterious Andrew White, who contributed the fantastic bass on 'Sweetnighter's wonderful 'Boogie-Woogie Waltz', it is impossible to deny that Zawinul picked some virtuoso bassists for the early albums: Miroslav Vitous, Al Johnson and Jaco Pastorius.  All three made solo records, of which I bought several.<br />But Jaco's is the only LP which I have since replaced with CD.  It is quite simply breath-taking.  Nothing that, say, RtF's Stanley Clarke recorded comes close to this in terms of technique or originality.  It is astonishingly varied, and maybe some of it is stuff to marvel at rather than tunes you'll catch yourself humming.  The string intro for 'Kuru/Speak Like a Child' has been much sampled over the years, and I suspect that even Chic were influenced for one of their 1978 records.  In the 25 years since first buying this record, I've never heard anything remotely like 'Continuum' or the deeply personal 'Portrait of Tracy'.<br />I like the new tracks on this re-issue -- particularly Lenny White's drumming on '6/4 Jam'.  Pat Metheny's extensive sleevenotes are revealing.  (Why did Jaco not record a track with Pat for this album?!)<br />I saw Jaco twice in concert with Weather Report, and he was appreciated more for his group contribution than his somewhat indulgent bass solos.  But this is how I will remember him, at his most talented, eager for the limelight, somehow developing a greater on-stage understanding with Joe Zawinul than Wayne Shorter could muster.  He was a great, inspired artist.h Pat for this album?!)<br />I saw Jaco twice in concert with Weather Report, and he was appreciated more for his group contribution than his somewhat indulgent bass solos.

B00005B4GU|5.0|If you loved OK Computer and hated Kid A, then you probably won't like Amnesiac. Radiohead's music is gradually progressing more and more towards the abstract, and the grand majority of young people in both the U.S., the U.K, and wherever you happen to be, prefer music that they can play on their guitars and exclaim, 'Dude, that song is...awesome!' over.<br />Radiohead now requires listening to in the way most truly good books require more involved reading than what you would put into a Maxim Magazine. Accept the fact that Amnesiac is not going to be Pablo Honey, The Bends, or OK Computer. In simple terms: Radiohead doesn't sound like that anymore, and they probably never will again. They obviously don't want to, and there's really no reason why they should.<br />Kid A and Amnesiac are much more subtle in their sound than any of their given predecessors. That's probably the largest factor in why they have lost and gained so many listeners in the transition between OK C and Kid A. I'm not saying that the subtle quality of the music goes over most listener's heads; it's only that non-stop F.M. radio listening usually makes peoples' musical ears lazy. They don't want to listen anymore; they want it all given to them by the musicians themselves. When you quit passively participating in and feeling what you're listening to, you eventually lose the ability altogether. <br />I'm not saying that it's hard to like Amnesiac. Another reviewer said that they felt it required a few listenings before it became user friendly, but I only needed one. I think it depends on what you're expecting. If you hated Kid A and was expecting Amnesiac to be Kid B, then you won't like Amnesiac. And if you're stuck in OK Computer mode, you won't particularly love either Kid A OR Amnesiac. Yet none of these albums are tied to each other musically. It's the same band playing different songs in a completely different way than they did on their previous albums. <br />The only problem that many peopleface is that only one of those albums was 100% radio friendly and 'easy to hear.' I wonder if you can guess which one that was. Here's a clue: It's not Amnesiac.
B00005BJC7|5.0|This album is a another great addition to the Radiohead collection.  It is definately from the same family as Kid A, and seems like a companion to the previous album.  Radiohead has obviously abandoned their original style of rock songs and replaced it with more creative, experimental music.  If a stranger to the band listened to this CD and then Pablo Honey, it would be hard to tell that the same band did both albums.  The ability to constantly change musical style shows a great deal of talent among musicians.  Just as Picasso traded his earlier contemporary art style for abstraction, Radiohead has followed along the same lines with their 'abstract music'.  This is an album to admire.  Even if it does echo Kid A in many ways, Radiohead has shed their skin and become a band of highly original artists, with a very unique style of music.
B00000K413|5.0|Every single song on the album is great, and that is an accomplishment in itself. But just look at what is on this CD: &quot;the hurting&quot; , &quot;pale shelter&quot;, &quot;memories fade&quot; are just a few of classic tunes. A great buy!
B000002TYX|5.0|This double cd set, the 1st of the 3 Anthologies, is a real treasure trove for true Beatles fans, as everything on here has never been released before. Packed with alternate takes, demos, rehearsals as well as snippets of interviews, this is something that is a must have. As well, it contains the first new Beatles recording since 1970, &quot;Free as a bird&quot;. The 48 page book is wonderful as well. Packed with photos and track-by-track information. Highly reccommended.
B00005AXEL|5.0|This is an exceptional CD and well worth the wait!!! Stevie's voice has never sounded better and she looks wonderful! This is the reason why Stevie has been so popular over the years and why her fans stand by her! We knew you could do it Stevie! Welcome back!!! We love you!
B000051S3H|5.0|This is truly a memorable version of this beloved classic. I wish it had been longer but wouldn't change a thing about it otherwise. I remember seeing it when it originally aired on TV in 1970. I was only 7 but never forgot it. The performances especially Scott's are wonderful. To me he will always be the definitive Rochester. And the score by John Williams is one of the most beautiful pieces of music I have ever heard, it's absolutely haunting.
B000056K04|5.0|I am a very big Dave Matthews Band fan, and have every one of their cd's. I must say that I am surprised on the turnout of his new album, &quot;Everyday&quot;. I loved it! Fans can spot the difference between his old stuff and his new stuff, but I probably can vouch for most fans by saying that the difference was good!     After reading fellow customer reviews, I saw that there were some people voicing the fact that it wasn't the best CD he has put out( In my opinion, the Live at Luther College with Tim Reynolds is the best cd by far)and I would also have to agree, yet don't automatically assume that it was the worst.    Dave Matthews is not to blame for his songs to become mainstream. &quot; I Did It&quot; and &quot;The Space Between&quot; have now hit the radio scene, attracting new fans from everywhere. We must come to realize that we too most likely heard Dave on the radio and thought &quot;What a great new artist!&quot; and began stocking up on his cd's. Why not do the same for the future fans who don't know about this wonderful band?    For those debating whether to buy this cd, I suggest to go ahead and buy it. Some songs that I recommend off this cd include, &quot;So Right&quot; ( sounds more like his old stuff), &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;Fool To Think&quot;, and &quot;Everyday&quot;.     I only hope that he can keep on going with great songs as well as great performances in years to come. Dave Matthews Rocks!!
B000002H33|5.0|I'm a huge Metallica fan, even the new stuff that people but down and critcize.  Master Of Puppets is my favorite album of all time.  You have all of the great elements, 1. James Hetfield-the best lyricist and fastest rhythm player of all time, and now he's turned into quite a good singer as well. 2. Lars Ulrich-Yeah, I know people hate him now (I don't), but putting that all aside, this album has some of the best drumming ever! 3. Kirk Hammett- The quietest and most emotional member of Metallica pulls off some of the most amazing solos ever recorded, just listen to the solo in &quot;Disposable Heroes&quot; and you will be amazed.  4. Last but never ever least, Cliff Burton-The single best bass player that ever lived, this guy taught us all what &quot;lead&quot; bass solos sound like, and the ending solo to &quot;Orion&quot; is no exception.  RIP Cliff.  This album is incredible!
0345404475|4.0|After reading some of the other reviews here and then the book itself, I have some thoughts on, &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; (DADOES). This is the second Philip K. Dick novel that I've ever read (the other being, &quot;The Divine Invasion,&quot; which I have reviewed).<br />I think Dick really explores the question of what human means in this novel. His main character, Rick Deckard is a bounty hunter for the San Francisco Police. He hunts renegade androids who have escaped from colony worlds (i.e Mars) and &quot;retires&quot; (kills) them. However, before he can retire the androids, he must verify that they are indeed androids. At this point, Deckard must administer the Voigt-Kampff Empathy Test, which measures instinctive emotional reactions to questions. As androids were designed without emotive capabilities (to distinguish them from humans; it seems they are otherwise indistinguishable), this is one of the few ways to identify them. Unfortunately, information emerges that says that sub-normal human with impaired with emotions could fail the test and thus be retired. I wish Dick had Deckard come to a scenario where he was very unsure about the status of someone standing before him, where he might have to take a chance...<br />The setting of the novel is after what is called, &quot;World War Terminus,&quot; in 2019. The World War Terminus seems to be some sort of global nuclear war, which has coated the planet in radioactive dust, which slowly killed many of the Earth's animals. \\"The legacy of World War Terminus had diminished in potency; those who could not survive the dust had passed into oblivion years ago, and the dust, weaker now and confronting the strong survivors, only deranged minds and genetic properties.\\" (page 8)  It retards humans, renders them infertile, ages them faster and has over non-lethal effects. I would have liked to know more about this fictional future war. One of the interesting historical quirks in the novel is that Dick predicted that the Soviet Union would still be in existence in 2019; of course one must keep in mind that Dick wrote the novel in 1968 (a 51 year projection).<br />In this future decaying Earth, the mass media is still enormously influential. There are two main parties competing for human allegiance. There is \\"Buster Friendly\\" who is some sort of 24 hours a day, 7 days a week comedy television program and then there is Wilbur Mercer. Mercer is part of the futuristic religion of Mercerism; Dick largely leaves Mercerism unexplored. Mercer acts as a guide for Decker but says he does have all the answers... Buster Friendly then exposes Mercer as a Hollywood-produced fake. Even after this, Mercer is still there. The main purpose of Mercerism seems to be experiencing an emotional fusion with Mercer who suffers some sort of on-going persecution. <br />To look at the title, it is necessary to go into the novel in some detail. The radioactive dust killed the gross majority of Earth animals rather quickly, so owning a real living animal is considered a major status symbol. As the animals are incredibly expensive, many people buy \\"electric\\" (i.e. synthetic, copies; analogous to the human/android contrast in the novel) animals as a substitute. The title is meant to express the paradoxical idea of whether synthetic humans (in one case of the novel, an android did not know it was, in fact, an android) dream of possessing synthetic animals.          <br />To look at Ridley Scott's interpretation of the novel in, \\"Blade Runner,\\" (1982) will be next. As other reviewers have said, the film it is perhaps more accurate to say that the novel inspired the film rather than saying the film is based on the novel. I will look at differences and the pro's and cons of it.<br />There were some substantial changes; the role of Roy Batty is significantly expanded. In the novel, he leads the last of the Nexus-6 androids (a new class of androids who can almost beat the Voigt-Kampff test). In thefilm and the novel, the lifespan of androids of set at four years. In the novel, it seems to be an arbitrary limit whereas in the film a cogent explanation is given. In the film, it is feared that after four years the androids (called replicants in the film; it carries more of a mass-produced ring to it) start to have emotional capabilities and would thus be able to blend in with humans. As a failsafe, the massive corporation that builds androids (Rosen Association in the novel, Rand in the film, I think) programmed their DNA to stop replicating after 4 years and thus any dead cells would not be replaced, leading to eventual death. The setting of the film is Los Angeles rather than San Francisco and I had a totally different mental picture of what Earth would look like. In the novel, one gets the impression that there are only a few thousand people on the planet, which is decaying away into nothing due to the dust. In the film, L.A. is a vibrant, somewhat decaying city where there is massive pollution but no dust. Generally, I didn't like the film though this may be simply because I'm not used to or a fan of the film noir genre. <br />Near the end of the film, Deckard has to fight Roy Batty to retire him. In the novel, Roy just stands there and gets blasted. After some chasing, fighting and so on, there is the best scene of the whole film where Deckard is hanging onto a building by his fingertips about to fall off and Roy Batty is watching and then Roy catches Deckard just as he looses grip. Roy Batty then has the best lines of the film where he talks about life and then dies, as he is at the end of his four years. The great irony is that the hunted replicant ends up saving Deckard, his hunter who only knew his quarry due to a lack of emotions.
B00003CXN4|3.0|Movie Summary:  There is a drug war going on. At times it seems both hopeless and pointless. This story follows three separate yet related plots lines. One involves the appointment of a new drug czar for the war on drugs in the United States. He struggles with  both his new job and the drug addiction of his own daughter. Another follows the case of an arrested American drug lord, the struggles his wife goes through to try to save their lifestyle, and the police officers that are trying to protect the main witness. The last one involves an honest Mexican police officer that has a very hard time doing the right thing.<br />My Opinion:  This movie is very well done in every way. Benicio Del Toro gives an awesome performance. The story is gripping and interesting. But even with all this, it just didn't excite me or stay with me. One of the main themes is that the war on drugs or war over drugs can be both pointless and hopeless yet it goes on. So it does. And I didn't care. The melding of the three separate plot lines is very similar to Magnolia and is very well done. At times, Traffic seems to be more of a documentary than a movie.<br />DVD Quality:  Widescreen anamorphic. Extras include the trailer, photo gallery and making of documentary. A good quality standard release.<br />What You Should Do:  Rent it if you liked the format of movies like Magnolia. You may like it enough to own, but you should check it out first.
0440219078|4.0|The Giver by Lois Lowry was a great science fiction novel wonderfully written.

0316777722|3.0|ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY is another collection featuring David Sedaris' especially mordant and hilarious sense of humor. He muses on the most ordinary events, but gives us a unique perspective. <br />My two favorite stories concern his childhood guitar lessons and his sojourn with his French boyfriend renovating a house in the French countryside. <br />While reading David Sedaris is entertaining in itself, nothing compares to HEARING him tell his stories on audiotape or CD. His humor comes through so much more vividly through his voice and not the printed word. Do yourself a favor and pick up an audio copy even if you've read the book. The experience is greatly enhanced. I know because I first encountered his work from listening to the audio version of NAKED, which is to this day my absolute Sedaris favorite!

0930289234|5.0|Alan Moore and David Gibbons tale of disfunctional superheroes is one of my personal favorite comic stories of all time.  The book is awesome, from the cinematic art, to Moore's superb dialouge and story telling.  The inter-chapters are very interesting and give some nice background information.  The comic book inside the comic is a nice touch, but drags on in the middle.  I have only a few complaints about this, one is the pacing.  12 issues was a bit long, I got bored with it about half way through the chapter about Dr. Manhanttan, but it did pick up with the Rorshach in jail part.  Like Moore's other large trade paper back From Hell, it draged a bit.  The art is very functional and works well.  I would compare it to Steve Dillons stuff on Preacher, it doesn't blow you away, but it does serve it's purpose.  Overall, this is one of those must have trades, along with Moore's American counterpart Frank Millers The Dark Knight Returns, and Millers earlier Daredevil work.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Wonderful textures and beautiful music.  Another example of why Radiohead just might be the best &quot;rock&quot; band of the 20th century.  Or at least right up there in the top two.  Listen to it twice and you will love it.

B00005BJC7|4.0|Ok I have to admit I'm a huge Radiohead fan, so I tried not to listen to the album before its release (I could'nt resist though lol)  And upon first listen I was dissapointed. To me it just sounded like B-sides from Kid A so I was immediately dissapointed. But now I realize I was wrong (it was probably because I was listening to it through my crappy computer speakers)I ordered the Limited edition anyways. I just recieved it today and boy was I wrong!!. First off, this edition is so cool looking. It comes in a red cloth-bound book. Which reminded me of Pearl Jams  Vitalogy album but much larger. Then theres a little library card in the little pocket where the CD is. I had to laugh when I saw this. According to the card the book isn't due until 2005 LOL. Then there are about 32 pages of Artwork. all the artwork is strangely beautiful... typical Radiohead. now to the album itself. While mot my favorite RH album, its definitely better than most of the music out there now. Its nowhere as easily accessible as earlier reports had it being. For people wanting to get into Radiohead, this album may not be the one to start with. don't take that as a slam though, its a very good album. Starting with track 1 Packt like sardines... on to the last track. though I must admit I thought a few songs were filler (Like spinning plates is a good example). Ok ok I'll shut up now. If youre a Radiohead fan  you'll like this album. If you hate Radiohead then this album should give you more ammunition. Thanks for reading
B000020617|2.0|'learn to fly' and 'generator' are decent songs.  Maybe download them somewhere, and save your money. The rest of the album is not really worth hearing.
B000002H33|5.0|This was the first CD I ever bought, when I was in 4th grade actually. I don't really know why I bought it, I'd never heard of Metallica, I really didn't listen to music a lot, but I had just gotten a paper route and had bought a new stereo. So when I went out to pick up a new CD to play in it, I guess this one just stuck out because of it's cool cover or something. To this day it's my favorite album of all time. If you're one of those younger metal fans, and you're into the Korn, Slipknot, Pantera, and &quot;New&quot; Metal scene, you owe it to yourself to pick up &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; and see how it all began. THE definitive metal album of all time, this one is epic. It's that good. If you're a hard rock/metal fan, just go out and buy the thing. I guarantee you won't regret it.
B00005B4GU|1.0|This album stinks to the same degree as &quot;Kid A&quot; ! Radiohead are capable of sublimely constructed pop classics... but you will find none of them here or on their previous dire offering !  The most upbeat song on the new album is &quot;The Pyramid Song&quot; and that in itself is depressing in the extreme.I cannot understand their success in the US. Has anyone over there listened to &quot;The Bends&quot; or &quot;OK Computer&quot;, 2 albums on which they had the guts to do what they do best...brilliant catchy songs ? This new stuff is far too experimental and depressing.I hope they fail miserably with this rubbish and return to what they are good at.
0395645662|5.0|Lowry did a wonderful job at both creating a fantastic story while having a rarely thought about theme about how controlled and standardized should everyone life's be. Of course their should be some control, but how much? This story definately shows that too much is a bad thing. With shocking revelations,  numerous unexpected events, you can't put this book down. It has mostly realistic events and concepts, and excellent descriptions so it seems like the story could possibly happen in the future, which i hope never does. You must read this book!
B00005B4GU|3.0|I'm a big Radiohead fan and I thought last year's &quot;Kid A&quot; was an enigmatic knockout, so I've been looking forward to &quot;Amnesiac&quot; for months now.  To say I'm disappointed is an understatement.  In short, this sounds like a collection of &quot;Kid A&quot; b-sides -- and pretty dull b-sides at that.  And what's with the lame alternate take of &quot;Morning Bell&quot;?  That's just shameless filler, which is something I thought Radiohead was above.  Grrrr....
B000050XEI|5.0|Honestly, this is one of the most fantastically homogenous, beautiful &amp; rapturing pieces of music I have ever heard.  Enya has the voice of an archangel.  If they ever wanted to clone talent of any sort, this is where they start--&amp; by the way they could finish with her too.  As my son has said--Ma, I'm going to marry this girl...
B000059R8Y|5.0|Reptile is not only beautiful, quality work by Clapton, but it is a body of work that will stand the test of time.  Consider this: what makes Clapton different from other rock stars that have been around 30+ years?  It's his ability to continue to search and try different things.  I like most Clapton fans wouldn't have any problem with him pumping out album after album of long, guitar solo driven music; he certainly hasn't lost his ability to play.  I just saw him in DC recently and he played great with a lot of energy.  But what other music legend would have the courage to record &quot;Son and Sylvia&quot;, &quot;Modern Girl&quot;, and others?  Of course he gives you the blues: &quot;Come Back Baby&quot;, &quot;Got You On My Mind&quot;, even &quot;Don't Let Me Be Lonely&quot; which is phenomenal.  Reptile is everything that can be right about popular music.  It is different and changes styles - who wants to hear the same thing over and over.  For those, like the person in Canada, that think he's supposed to do the same thing from CD to CD, you're missing the point; you're obviously not a musician or a creative person.  Anyone that has a clue about creativity will know the very first listen through Reptile that this record is classic, the songs are very melodic, he's singing better than ever, and it leaves you wanting more.  Bravo Clapton!
B00005IBGQ|5.0|I really love it.  I feel like its a little bit more catchy than the 1st CD.  I saw him in concert before the CD was released, and he played all his new songs.  It was easy to get into them right away--and I don't think I felt that way about the 1st CD.  (it took a bunch of listenings before I knew them well enough to love)  I don't know if that makes it better--but I feel like I instantly fell in love with these new songs.  Especially SHADOWS--which I need to listen to at the loudest my stereo can go.  So fun to sing to (the mark of a great song for me)
B000050XEI|5.0|Enya has truly done it again. Since she began singing with Clannad and then beginning her solo career with the album The Celts, she has shown the world her talent with music and voice. She does all the music herself just about and every cd she has made has come out outstanding! There is however, a lack of Gaelic songs in this cd, and I was a bit disappointed because I love the Gaelic Language. I truly believe Enya does not need to experiment with her music, after all, sometimes that just leads to disaster.
6305265488|5.0|very good cimematography,great story, loved it my favorite movie ever
0441172717|5.0|Frank Herbert's Dune is the first in an epic series, titled after the first book. It is a intricate story which is both entertaining and enlightening. Frank Herbert spent six years prior to writing the book just researching related topics, and he was a reporter before that time.      His book has a complicated by addictive story centered around Paul Atreides, an heir to a planet in the human empire. The empire is divided in a kind of fuedal system - and the Atreides family is one of the noble families. Their enemies are the vile Harkonnen, a morally decrepid family of dictators. When Paul's family is sent to Arrakis (titled Dune by the natives), he is caught in an intricate plot filled with politics, morallity, and military planning.      I loved the book, and it remains to be one of my favorite stories of all time. There are a few reasons for this. The first is that the book is not a Hollywood style movie, it has realistic and detailed events. I learned more about the inner workings of politics from the book then I knew before reading it! The second reason involves the level of maturity, which is self-explainitory. I feel it portrays events that could happen in the future, not just a story that has a futuristic setting. It details daily life, character traits, and countless other things that are crucial to such realism. Also, every character has a flaw or two; a stark contrast to the typical, invincible main character of most books.     It is, however, a very complicated plot. To fully understand the book, or to get anything out of it, one is required to read between the lines. Motives are not directly thrown at you, and there is very little to no forshadowing. Very complex issues with extreme amounts of detail are explained in the book, and not a single page of it can be missed. I had to re-read many of the pages just to understand the events fully. I tried to have one of my friends read it after I was done, and he seemed to get confused on the simplest topics - let alone the deeper lessons of the book.      If you are a reader who feels limited by your current material, or if you feel you really need something different, Dune is definately the right choice. If you are new to reading, or do not feel comfortable with spending large amounts of time on a book, then Dune is probably a book that should be read at a later time.
B000002LE6|3.0|Lovesexy has 3 strikes against it: the 1 track setup, &quot;Eye No&quot; and &quot;Positivity&quot; (two of the worst songs he's ever recorded). That doesn't necessarily stop me from listening to the album. If you get past those two songs this album put's itself up there near the top. Lovesexy would have been an excellent 4 star album, but certain factors bring it down to 3.
0140131558|5.0|When I think about the 2 or 3 days in which I threw myself into this book, unable to pry myself from its grip (e.g. on the first evening I was persuaded to make a ham omelet), I'm reminded of a quote by William Faulkner - an epigraph in Modris Ekstein's book 'Walking since Daybreak:' &quot;There is no such thing as 'was' -only is.&quot; Faulkner's singling out of the semantic &quot;was&quot; is no doubt something Auster would appreciate; but on another level it is revealing of how stories can be powerful and enlightening not for what they tell but for what they carry around with them. For instance,'The New York Trilogy' is brimming with insightful readings of literary figures (Don Quixote), with renderings of well-known stories (by H. James), of legends and biographies - indeed, Whitman, Bahktin, Casper Hauser and Robert Mitchum all make an appearance. The point is that nothing can be told that hasn't in some way been told before; everything has a precedent; &quot;...you know the story already by heart,&quot; Black says to Blue, and in one way that is a prerequisite. The weight of the book, its texture, place, sound all resonate with a &quot;culture&quot; of books and sounds. And yet knowing the story already doesn't take away from its power or brilliance but just the opposite.  -dg
B000002LHX|3.0|Batman is one of two Prince albums that's flirting in the 2-3 star range so far (Prince is the other). Although &quot;Batdance&quot; and &quot;Scandelous&quot; are probably some of the best songs on the album, they hardly break any new ground. Other great songs include &quot;The Future&quot;(this song saved it from being 2 stars) and &quot;Partyman&quot;. Overall, Batman is JUST a album to listen to and that's it! There's nothing here that will get you out of your seat.
B00003CXP1|5.0|You will be totally numbed with shock when you finish this movie.<br />I don't know what more to write about the movie that hasn't already been written.  You will be horrified by Requiem for a Dream but you absolutely must see it.
B00004Z1MN|5.0|when i first heard about this movie, i wanted to see it.  however, that feeling quickly vanished.  i finally watched it after visiting the video store one day and not wanting to leave empty-handed.  boy was i suprised and amazed.  i love this movie.  dennis quaid and jim caviezel have a fantastic connection as father and son, even though they only have one scene together.  they become their characters completely.  i very much enjoyed the multiple plot scenarios starting with john (caviezel) trying to protect frank (quaid) from the latter's reversable doom.  the increasing suspense kept me literally quivering on the edge of my seat.  i also was pleased with the strong family relationships among the characters.  the love that frank and julia (elizabeth mitchell, in a great strong woman role) display in the kitchen as they dance is a forgotten concept in the majority of movies these days.  this movie touched me on all levels.  i highly recommend this movie as a family film.  just be careful around the kids; there is a little bit of profanity.
1878424114|5.0|Everyones should have a space reserved on their book shelf for this book.  The seven laws are simple to understand and to put into practice.  Its serves as a manual for those interested in making a transformation in life, a paradigm shift, a change in attitude.  Experience success with least effort and realize your pure potential.
B0000025VU|2.0|The first time I heard a track from the album was when a friend played &quot;Don't Fall Apart on Me Tonight&quot; on acoustic guitar.  I fell in love with the mood set by the song and bought the CD (after many previous Dylan purchases) believing the song would be joined by others of similar emotive quality.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the album.  I appreciate that Dylan was making social observations on other tracks (although many were too subtle for this mid-twenties fan) but the songs do not contain the folk starkness of his early albums nor the burning rock melodies of other work.  Someone has to note that this album lacks the stripped-down honesty and the ear-cathing riffs that make Dylan special.  Most reading this review will be looking for compliments for the album, but (especially newer fans) I recommend picking a different album.  Try the Live '66 concert and the Free Wheeling Bob Dylan for intimate performances).
B000059QYB|5.0|I think this is a great album to listen to. It brings back the memories of the 80's and early 90's when I use to always listen to Billy Idol's \\"Rebel Yell\\" and \\"To Be A Lover\\" on the radio, because I never knew about when he we in concert.    The name song \\"Don't You (Forget About Me)\\" is an awesome remake... I think Billy does it so much better!! Billy Idol... You ROCK!! Keep up the good work! Can't wait to hear your new album that's expected to be released next year (2002)! Also can't wait to see you again!! You were awesome in NJ and DC! You and Steve make the music worth listening to!! You're so hot together!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I was waiting to see Moulin Rouge since March, I think.  Having finally seen it, I was not disappointed at all; all my expectations have been fulfilled by the flic.  The soundtrack, to say the least, is spectacular! Again, Baz Luhrmann shows us that a good movie doesn't need just good actors and a good script, but also excellent production design and music in order to make it a great experience.  Both Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor sing with strong, consistent, and beautiful voices in their love duets \\"Elephant Love Medley\\" and \\"Come What May.\\"  Alone, Kidman is just as convincing a singer, as we hear in several Moulin Rouge production scenes as well as the beautiful remake \\"One Day I'll Fly Away.\\"  McGregor is an excellent person to sing Elton John's \\"Your Song\\" and co-star in \\"El Tango de Roxanne.\\" Now comes the only disappointment:  All songs on this album are covers of previously released and popular material as well as songs written for the soundtrack that were never actually intended to be in the movie, save the redone version of \\"Nature Boy\\" by David Bowie.  The movie features some more excellent music, like \\"Zidler's Rap,\\" the proposal of Toulouse-Lautrec's musical \\"Spectacular, Spectacular!\\" and more.  Hopefully, Luhrmann and Fox are already working on a \\"Romeo + Juliet\\" like Volume Two of the soundtrack, filled entirely with original score by Craig Armstrong and songs originally written for and performed in the movie. Buy it!
6304286961|4.0|This was a good show in all. Very Trippy!! Anyone notice that Billy Idol appeared in it?? heehee! Billy played &quot;Kat&quot;. He had brown long hair and was on crutches. He was briefly at the bar. Be careful... if you blink, you'll miss him!! :o)
0395759242|4.0|In this well researched and documented revelation, the author did not spare anybody in the pursuit of laying bare the vulgarity of colonial conquest. The book is, of course, mainly about Leopold ll's avarice and cruel exploitation of a big piece of Africa---a man indifferent to art, music or literature who became a dedicated scholar and practitioner when it came to his favorite subject--profits.<br />An eye opener from start to finish, it confirms what a lot of people have long suspected: that Joseph Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; (with its dark and brooding words) is fiction based on fact. The book is then an attack on the Belgian colonialism of the Congo, on the exploitation of innocent people in their own country for selfish gain, and the ruin of a native culture and environment. It tells much and explains why inside the human heart, Europeans were as &quot;dark&quot; as the Africans. So much for culture and civility.<br />For the sake of even handedness the author, for example, mentions that Conrad, while denouncing European lust for riches in Africa, was also an investor in a gold mine in Johannesburg. Here are the unvarnished truth about Henry Morton Stanley; the machinations that led the USA to be the first country to recognize King Leopold ll's claim to the Congo; the advent of E.D. Morel, the `greatest British investigative journalist of his time who's meticulous and painstaking research' withstood the test of time and further research. The natives in turn are not exactly paragons of primeval innocence, for many practised slavery and ritual cannibalism where prowess in warfare were symbolized by severed heads and hands (later practised by Leopold's henchmen in such horrific scale). The maiming of women (forced clitoridectomies) still occurs as in other parts of Africa, a brutal initiation rite in itself, which is just a custom.<br />The attempts in psycho-analysis maybe far fetched but even if it hits or misses the point, it is an attempt to explain (as authors are supposed to) the why and the how. It takes immense effort to search for the truth or the underlying causes just as reaching conclusions about life's meaning is also difficult.<br />This is a book which will be hard to ignore if  one wants a better understanding of the Africa of today. There are parallels in this shocking story. The genocide of the Hereros in today's Namibia, Britain's mass killings of Aborigines in Australia (in the state of Tasmania, not one single native was left at one point in time), the destruction of the American Indians, World War ll's holocaust, the Soviet Gulag, the Turkish massacre of Armenians...somel are mentioned in passing in this book as an example of man's inhumanity to man. The main aim of the book maybe that we should not be a part or an instrument to &quot;the politics of forgetting&quot;. One should just remember the well known quote of the philosopher  Santayana: &quot;Those who do not remember the past are condemned to relive it.&quot; Or perhaps Lord Acton's: &quot;Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.&quot;<br />The book ends with the well-founded conclusion that the major legacy left to Africa by the colonial powers was not democracy as properly practised but authoritarian rule and plunder,  as witnessed by contemporary events, perpetrated by some of its own native rulers to its own people.(as authors are supposed to) the why and the how.

B000002LFU|5.0|This is how I like to remember R.E.M. I believe that they reached their top form during the 80's and early 90's. The reason I believe that this album is so great is because its not perfect. Unlike recent R.E.M. albums &quot;Reveal&quot;, &quot;Up&quot;, &quot;Hi-Fi&quot;, this one is filled with imperfections. Michael Stipe's vocals crack all over the place, conveying the pure emotion he sings with. Mike Mill's bass isn't anything impressive and Bill Berry's drum parts are incredibly simple. When all this is put together though just right, the 4 boys from Athens have the ability to create something beautiful, and the album &quot;Green&quot; is that something. You can listen to this album straight through without skipping a song. &quot;Get Up&quot;, &quot;Pop Song 89&quot;, &quot;Orange Crush&quot;, &quot;Stand&quot;, &quot;World Leader Pretend&quot;, &quot;I Remember California&quot;, the list goes on. If you are looking to get into R.E.M., this is a great album to start with. &quot;Dreams they complicate my life&quot;
B0000033OZ|5.0|My journey to ELP's first album was through King Crimson's debut (itself pretty amazing) and Greg Lake's sensational voice on that particular release.  Hearing &quot;Knife Edge&quot; for the first time over a crackly AM transmitter in 1974(?), late at night with the lights out, sent a chill down my spine that has never quite gone away.  Someone else in a review has said it perfectly: hearing this album in it's entirity leaves you crying in despair: &quot;where has all this good music gone to?&quot;.  You just don't seem to get rock musicians like Keith Emerson, Rick Wakeman (Yes) or Ian Anderson (Jethro Tull) these days anymore!  So &quot;Knife Edge&quot; made me buy the vinyl Atlantic pressing many years ago and &quot;Lucky Man&quot;, &quot;Tank&quot; and &quot;Take A Pebble&quot; made me think I may have just bought one of the best albums of the 70's ever released.  As a community radio announcer, I take great delight in playing tracks from this album as if to say to the world: this is what you young'uns have missed out on!   This is what the rest of the 70's should have been like!!  Never heard any ELP music?  Do NOT buy this album first off, because nothing else will ever sound as good.
B000002H33|5.0|1 word.  Excellent.  This word describes &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;.  A metal masterpiece.  8 songs, ranging from 5-8 minutes, this is definitely worth listening through the entire CD once you put it on.  It starts off with Battery, a song about, well, battery!  Man, Hetfield on guitar will really blow you away.  Then, up next is Master of Puppets, the title track.  It's about drug abuse.  Listen to the words and you'll understand them once you really think about them.  The Thing that Should Not Be is third.  It's basically about a horrid, mutated monster.  One of my favorites.  Welcome Home(Sanitarium) is a slow, meaningful song.  That is second best on the track.  Disposable Heroes is kind of anti-war, about death and everything, how masses of soldiers just die in a war.  Leper Messiah is not one of my favorites.  Still, enjoyable.  Orion is just a blast!  I couldn't believe it, it was amazing.  Over 8 minutes of instrumentality.  Damage Inc. is awesome and FAST!  It has some cuss words, but it goes so fast you can hardly hear the bad words.  On this song, Hetfield does the fastest, most furious rythm guitar ever heard.  Amazing, I gave this CD 5 stars because Metallica is AWESOME.  They're my favorite band.  I hope you enjoy this CD as much as I do.
B00005B36H|3.0|I've been listening to Tool since their early days when nobody knew who they were.  I was intrigued by this &quot;thinking man's metal band,&quot; with their charismatic lead singer and terrific musicianship.  I have always maintained that Aenima is one of the best rock albums of the 90's.  Brooding, seething with mystery, dark and disturbing, Aenima is truly awesome.  I have listened to it countless times and still come away with something new every time.<br />Lateralus, while obviously the work of a passionate, talented band, is simply not on par with its predecessor.  I've let Lateralus sink in before reaching this conclusion.  It's not a bad album by any stretch.  In fact, it contains many impressive moments.  The Grudge is terrific.  The Patient is strangely compelling.  Parabola and Ticks and Leeches rock hard.  And Reflection lingers in the head long after the song has stopped playing.  So what is the problem?  I'd have to say that the problem lies in the songwriting.<br />The songs were just uniformly more intriguing and moving on Aenima.  On that album, there were more layers to unravel, more mysteries to unfold.  Nothing here reaches the same epic sweep of Third Eye, or the same moody brilliance of 46 and 2.  Rhythmically, Lateralus can be redundant.  Although Danny Carey is a fantastic drummer, his tribal-like drumming in virtually every song eventually turns the ear off.  Even some of the guitar parts sound predictable and pedestrian by Tool standards, as if Metallica were trying to make a Tool-sounding album and not quite succeeding.<br />It goes without saying that Lateralus is far more provocative and compelling than anything else currently riding high on the album charts.  But Aenima, for me anyway, remains Tool's one true masterwork.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|There is humour and great music.  The story and the action keep moving through the movie.  They pick you up and carry you through in a wild rush.  I left exhilerated.<br />Wonderful filme.
B00005JCA9|1.0|Why oh why does Hollywood torment us with the same nonsense day in and day out? Julia's 24 capped teeth shine bright in this otherwise bland story about...oh who cares! It's Julia Roberts, the hottest actress for the next year or so, until the media finds someone else who's willing to sell out. And Hugh Grant, british chum extraordinaire, stars as...the other guy. Frankly, I could have spend my two hours cleaning the gunk from underneath my toenails with icicles. Rent a real movie instead of this rubbish!
B00005BF9Z|4.0|This is a great follow up to &quot;Clandestino&quot;.  Manu's knowledge of latin music is encyclopedic.  He continues to develop this really hypnotic interlatin(did I just invent a word?) groove.  Someone commented that there's a &quot;recycle&quot; of 'King of the bongo'.  It's based on the same song, but the lyrics have been twisted all around.  Manu goes beyond the latin feel that pervades the album, though, at times sounding like a latin version of the Beatles.  Definitely one that will spend a lot ot time in the CD player.
B00005B4GU|5.0|If you had announced in 1967 that &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was the greatest album in the history of popular music, people would have dismissed you as a Beatles freak.  But 20 years later the world's rock critics -- and most of the rest of the planet -- would come to agree.  There are Beatles records that I listen to more often, but it's hard to deny the audacity of &quot;Sgt. Pepper,&quot; the way it seems to pull together the entire history of song and apply it to an examination of Life on Earth, circa 1967.<br />Most of the world or rock criticism has already annointed &quot;OK Computer&quot; (1997) Radiohead's masterpiece -- and it is breathtaking -- but it is only the &quot;Revolver&quot; of this Oxford band's ouvre.  &quot;Amnesiac&quot; is yet another pinnacle.<br />Where &quot;OK Computer&quot; begins with a guitar riff, &quot;Amnesiac&quot; starts with what sounds like a drum set at the bottom of a swimming pool.  &quot;Packt Like Sardines In A Crushd Tin Box&quot; is (like much of last year's &quot;Kid A&quot;), electronica that, refreshingly, doesn't sound like it evolved from disco, hip-hop, or lite pop.  &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot; sounds like Laurie Anderson playing around with Trent Reznor's sample collection and is quite possibly the most arresting thing Radiohead has ever committed to tape.<br />&quot;What!?&quot; the masses cry.  &quot;But where's the guitar?  You can't even tell what the words are!&quot;  Such outcry sounds vaguely like lambasting Picasso for drawing all those messed-up faces.  Anyone wanting to hear this band repeat &quot;The Bends&quot; (1995) -- or anything else they've ever heard -- is either listening to the wrong band or listening in the wrong way.  Radiohead has left all conventions and expectations behind.<br />This is not a record to put on at a birthday party, or while you're driving to the beach, or (god forbid) while studying.  This is one to put on, and turn out all the lights, and lay on the floor, and experience.  Suspend disbelief, as one would in a movie theater, and let the music take you where it will.  The melodies are there, and the humanity -- and, yes, the guitars -- but these comforts arrive well-disguised and under cover of a dark and mysterious night -- not unlike &quot;Within You Without You&quot; or &quot;Mr. Kite&quot; from &quot;Sgt. Pepper.&quot;  It's too soon to rationally call &quot;Amnesiac&quot; the best rock album ever made, but it's not hard to imagine a future, 20 years down the road, where nothing sounds as powerful or inspired as this.
B00005B4GU|3.0|Amnesiac can be considered the sister album of Radiohead's last venture, Kid A.  Both were recorded together, during the bands hiatus after releasing O.K. Computer.  And while they share a similiar bittersweet tone, the overall sound of Amnesiac is remarkably different from Kid A (which may account for why they were not released as a double CD).<br />I will preface the rest of my review by saying that I loved Kid A...  I think it is probably Radiohead's most impressive album to date.  So, that said, I had very high hopes for Amnesiac.  And while it would be hard to consider Amnesiac a bad album, it is a bit of a let down after Kid A.<br />From reviews I had read before I bought the CD, I was expecting Amnesiac to be a return to the older sounds of Radiohead:  soaring vocals over a guitar driven beat.  And, to some degree, it is... there is far less of an electronic sound than Kid A, but it lacks the clarity of their earlier works.  Amnesiac sounds like an echo of Radioheads prior CD's; the sound is there, but it has been changed and distorted from it's original state.  So instead of being a return to the original Radiohead sound, it would be more fair to say that Amnesiac only pays tribute to it... Amnesiac shares a memory of the older sound while still looking on to something else.  I am surprised that it wasn't released before Kid A, as this would make a good prequel for it.<br />When all is said and done, Amnesiac does deliver the goods.  There are a few truly remarkable tracks, and as a whole it stands up well in it's own right.  But I must admit that I was left wanting more; Amnesiac still feels like it's only a whisper of better things Radiohead has planned for the future.
B000002J3W|5.0|I'll be real honest, the first time I heard this I was with a friend of mine and we were thinking...&quot;New Skid Row!&quot;  Then My enemy started,  we looked at eachother and said simultaneously, &quot; what the hell is this crap?&quot;  6 years later it is my favorite Skid album and one of my all time favorites.  Its not old school Skid, which at 1st will drive you nuts,  but one time through and youll be hooked!   BREAKIN DOWN shouldve been released, I guarantee that wouldve been huge and wouldve no doubt established Skid Row as the best 80's band still rockin in the 90s and probably still today.  I blame the media (rolling stone mag, and others) for destroying one of the best bands ever formed! Buy it....NOW!
B00005B36H|5.0|This review is more of a response to those who think this album is garbage. They are entitled to their opinion, and they do bring up some valid points. I agree that this album is a departure from Undertow and Aenima. After waiting(like everyone else) for 5 years, I was looking forward something that pulsating, alive and intense. I gotta say that this, at first was not what I was hoping for. No &quot;46 and 2&quot; here, but I could tell that it was at worst, solid. Within 3 days of commuting to and from work, I found that I was cranking it up louder and louder and finally realized that this is a friggin masterpiece. I absolutely love this album and I can't get enough. I admire what Maynard and the boys have created, and I am glad that I didn't let my initial (mild) let-down discourage me from enjoying this album.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I have written a review of this compilation earlier but I see some misinformation out there that needs to be addressed. A reviewer recently wrote that many of these songs didn't really go to #1. What does he mean by that? Many of these songs were #1 in the USA, while the ones that didn't go to the top spot here went to #1 in England(Ex. Lady Madonna, The ballad of John and Yoko).Check the info inside the CD for details. To say that many of the Beatles classic songs were omitted from this compilation misses the point. This is a collection of their #1 hits and in effect  contain many classic songs.Do I need to argue which ones? You might suspect that Capitol marketing made this an outrageous success but so what. No amount of hype is going to sell a bad product. I'm glad this CD caught on because it gives many young people the chance to hear this music and judging by the sales and reviews apparently it has.This should give the novice listener the incentive to investigate the rest of the Beatles catalog.And that could be a good thing for the future of pop/rock music.
0312084986|4.0|This is NOT a great work of literature. It is as wonderful a work of master story telling as is available anywhere. James Harriot is able to place his world of animals, their owners and his life work with them on the pages of this book. A truly good read, indeed.
1567184855|5.0|I was strangely drawn to this book when I was looking for something else entirely.  I couldn't put it down from the moment I started reading and thus my journey into life and spiritualtiy began.  I was thinking of my grandfather who recently passed and this book seemed to come out of no where.  To this day I feel there is a reason I had to read this book.  It has helped know that there is life after death and that we have a purpose here on earth to be fullfilled no matter how small it may seem.  I would reccomend this book to anyone who was struggling with the passing of a loved one or there own fear of death and wondering what the meaning of there time in life was.  Perhaps helping someone get in touch with there own spiritual growth and understanding.  Good luck to all looking for there path in life. I would also reccomend his second book Destiny of souls which continues from his first with much more soul life detail and information.
B00003CXDZ|1.0|We were looking forward to a movie with passion and excitement, and got a musical with songs that were out of place and not sung very well either.  Imagine the scene set around 1900 and the songs that are sung are from today's music.  None of the dance/music pieces were long enough to grab the viewer, more like abbreviated clips.  Nicole Kidman is beautiful but she can't sing well enough for a musical.  The first half of the movie was so confusing and boring, and the exaggerated theatrics of the characters were too much.  Acting does not involve screaming your lines with emphasis on the end of the sentences.  Ziegler, the theater director, is annoying, and Ewan, the male romance interest, was bland.  The last 1/3 of the movie was better, but not enough to save it.  It was disappointing because the premise behind the movie could have created something wonderful.
B0000214F0|1.0|The title says everything and it is not because of explicit porno. This movie has very little value from the point of view of the movie art, from the point of view of history, and, I guess, from the point of view of porno also (although I must confess that I am not a porno connoisseur).  Some historical facts are true: like main personages and events, but the portrayal of other things is either completely fake or exaggerated.  So I really do not think that it deserves more than 1 star for that small list of positive sides.
B00003CXRP|4.0|I thought this movie was pretty good.  Honestly, nothing spectacular.  Yet when I think about the scenes I tend to remember them all fondly.  Except one.  I was really enjoying the movie and just about to put it on my &quot;buy the DVD&quot; list when the whale winked at Chuck during his escape.  I couldn't believe they put that in there.  I can't imagine Tom Hanks screneing the film and saying &quot;looks great, winking whale and all.&quot;  Everything else ranged from great to highly entertaining.  I will probably buy the DVD regardless of the WINKING WHALE...AAAAGGGGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Hey! Actually I just got ma CD even though I bought it 2 weeks ago cuz it got stuck in my friends CD player in his car.. so i couldn't get it out.. nehow.. this is the weirdest yet most creative and eccentric CD i've ever heard.. Lady Marmalade was the first track i turned to and itz really kewl cuz of the bass and background sounds.. my favorites include the really cool sounding Hindu Sad Diamonds.. i also liked the Sparkling Diamonds medly.. the whole CD rocks and therez something on it for everyone! the rock &quot;Chidren of the Revolution&quot; and the dance &quot;Because We Can&quot; goes through the whole music spectrum.. even Nicole Kidman has a great voice, but i don't really like Ewan McGregor's voice...the whole CD is bursting with energy.. i listened to it at nite hoping that i could fall asleep to it.. but it was so exhilarating that i couldn't sleep for 2 hours.. but oh well.. i loved it! go buy it.. i hafn't seen the movie but i hope it'll be even better! hard to beat though ;-)
0316776963|3.0|I recently read \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" and \\"Naked\\" (both by David Sedaris).   Sedaris' style is very funny, tongue in cheek though some of the humor is extremely subtle.  Anyone with a dry sense of humor will enjoy this, and gay men who can relate to the vignettes about growing up different will find it especially familiar.<br />The later chapters of each book seem to have a sitcom-esque quality to them, though.  The chapters seem to end where they began, as if they could be read in any order.  Despite the subtlety of the humor, the comedy seems dull and repetitive by the end of the book. ...

He wanted me to recognize his power and desire to have that power for myself one day.&#8221; On page 172, he says, &#8220;I have found the principles of finding value are the same regardless if it&#8217;s real estate, stocks,...or a new spouse...&#8221; \\"<br />(this is about friendship) \\"On page 154, Kiyosaki says &#8220;the reason you want to have rich friends&#8221; is to get inside stock market information that you can make low-risk profits. He ends that discussion with the sentence, &#8220;That is what friends are for.&#8221; That is the narrowest, most mercenary definition of friendship I have ever seen. I doubt Kiyosaki is the only person who feels this way about his friends, but he may be the only one dumb enough to say it in a book. \\"
B00005B4GU|3.0|I was looking forward to this one after reading some interviews with Thom where he said it would be more guitar driven. Anyway, it sounds like there are less guitars than on Kid A. Not that that is a bad thing, just not what I was expecting. I like about half of the songs ok, and the rest are take it or leave it, in my opinion. I think Kid A is an awesome record - this one is half as good. Can anyone please explain Life In a Glasshouse??? God-awful.  Sometimes I think Radiohead is messing with us...
B000001FXT|5.0|This is one of the great recordings of all time.  And I am not going to be an idiot and say but this or but that.  But nothing.  Bob Marley is the greatest popular musician of the 20th century.  And this album was recorded at the peak of his creative powers.  Make no mistake.  This is the real deal.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|This film was simply amazing. The music, costumes, dialogue, and perfomances were superb. It was funny at times and dramatic at times, but never disappointing. Check out Luhrman's other films first if you are unsure about catching this one in the theaters, once you have gotten a taste of his style you will want to see this lavish production on the big screen for its full effect. You will enjoy this one.
0783117523|5.0|After I watch the film I had a tremendous buzz. Angelina's portrail of Gia was so powerful, so dramatic, she left me speechless. I can't even put it into words now...it was outstanding, an amazingly heart warming performance by Jolie,  with a endearing performance by co-star Elizabeth Mitchell. I definately recommend it!
B000002U8G|5.0|For years this ranked as my favourite album of all time. The days of having &quot;a favourite album of all time&quot; are thankfully in the past, and in any event this would not be it. And yet it still has a special place of affection in my heart. It was the first music I ever *really* grooved to, got lost in, fantasized about. At the age of 20, it opened up a chink in my soul that has grown into an auditorium packed with everything from pop to high classics.<br />That was then, but this is now. Looked at in the cold light of the 21st century, we have something that has unquestionably dated. It has aged less well than contemporary work by other Bri-prog-rockers such as King Crimson or Yes, or the US West Coast psychedelic bands. <br />While we're looking at the downside, you could almost accuse this of only being half an album. Side 1 contains one track (&quot;Careful With That Axe, Eugene&quot;) that is by the standards of any era outstanding; a searing gothic tone-poem that used to turn stoned undergraduates' backbones to jelly. However, an uncharitable listener could be excused for wondering whether the rest of side 1 was just filler. I don't accept that viewpoint; it's always been the snappy pop songs with disturbing sonic and lyrical undercurrents (rather than endless noodling or experimental guitar solos) that have represented the purest expression of the Floyd's art (see my review of R.E.M.'s 'Reveal'). Nevertheless, it's only afore-mentioned 'Eugene' from the whole of side 1 that that can hold its own with the sublime side 2. And since 'Eugene' works so much better in the live version from &quot;Ummagumma&quot;, there are still vinyl copies in people's attics where side 1 has never felt the needle.<br />The good news is that &quot;Echoes&quot;, the track that takes up the whole of side 2 (and is tellingly the title by which many people still mistakenly refer to the album) justifies the outlay all by itself. It has been seen by many literate hippies (whetherrightly or wrongly) as a sort of musical overture to J.R.R. Tolkien's epic trilogy of novels, &quot;The Lord of The Rings&quot;. The purpose of an overture is to be the introduction to an opera, giving the audience a taster of its main ideas and tunes. Whether by accident or design, 'Echoes' parallels the literary work very well, and whether or not you see or care about these correspondences, it is clearly meant to be programmatic. <br />In other words, 'Echoes' tells a story. Whether that story involves hobbits and nazgul or not, the listener must judge. Either way, the music demands total absorption. The flow and development of ideas (the dynamics if you like the term) are more important than any particular tune or sonic effect, and listening to a snatch in isolation would be like picking a chapter in isolation out of a novel.<br />The tunes themselves are actually devastating, and the brief vocal is deceptively ambitious. At first sight, it seems little more than a ditty about birds and windows and sunlight, the voice fey and adolescent. But repeated listening (and believe me, some people have listened to this long track on headphones with their eyes shut literally hundreds of times) shows that the lyrical ideas and melody have a depth and resonance that's vaguely reminiscent of Schubert lieder (high praise coming from me).<br />The instrumental tunes are also lush. The rhythms are simple but hypnotic. The atonal interlude brings mental pictures of desolation and diving birds of prey - it provoked terror in many chemically-enhanced imaginations. The final resolution is serene and life-enhancing - you never want the long, breathy organ chords to end, but when the piano starts to weave a delicate filigree between them, later punctuated by the water-drop sounds that opened the track, you simply sigh. As the wind rises at the end, many listeners just reach for the repeat button.<br />Sonically it does sound dated, but it is still an event of unmatched beauty. It mustsurely rank (of course I could be wrong) as the only rock album track ever to inspire freelance film director to produce an abstract visual accompaniment for it - a 20 minute kaleidoscope of blue and white apparently produced by immersing a waterproof camera into the wake of a speedboat. It documents a brief time when hippydom inspired music of truth and beauty - when the money and the the drugs and the ambition and the political dialectic all seemed an irrelevance.
6305426651|5.0|You know, is there anyone else but me who watches movies to escape from reality for two hours, instead of being swallowed by it?  True, great dramatic movies like Schindler's List and the sort should be as accurate as possible, but can we really demand so much from a comedy?<br />I found the performances of both the father and the son touching and heartwarming, regardless of the setting, Nazi prison camp or not, realistic or not.  The second half of the movie, yes, requires you to suspend your disbelief a bit, but so does Shakespeare.  The plot was seamless, well written, and wonderfully acted.  I would suggest to anyone who thinks it was below par to try writing or acting their own, and do it better than this.<br />I extend my well-deserved praise to &quot;Life is Beautiful,&quot; which truly changed my attitude for days.  Clean enough to watch with your parents without cringing, well deserving of it's best Foreign Film Oscar.  Watch it, I beg you, and it will change your life.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I know that a lot of people are calling this album Kid B, because it was recorded in the same sessions as Kid A, but it has to be taken as an independant album.  Amnesiac is similar in sound to Kid A but i dont mind as i loved that album so it could be considered as an extention.  My favourite tracks on the album are Pyramid Song, Knives Out, Dollars and Cents and I Might Be Wrong.  If you loved Kid A you will love this, if you are expecting a huge change then you will be disappointed, but i still think that you should buy this album as its top class

0446310786|4.0|Its a grate book and it is worthy of bein a classic. But it only got good towrds the end. The begining was so boring I could hardley stay awake, the middle was charming but did not make my thirst for something more go away. The end was when I was finally satisfied but that was only four or five chapters out of a book that has 31 chapters. I say take it or leave it or better yet only read this book if you have to but if you have a choice in the matter leave it.
B00005BL2A|2.0|...first, the songs. back in the good ol' days, the songs were these basically trite, memorable, lyrics with a catchy melody. that was basically DM's essance. now, you've still got the trite lyrics, but the background is this wash of synth-techno-babble.<br />which brings me to the the production. the main reason i liked DM is because they were pioneers in music. yeah, Kraftwerk had a whole band of synthesizers too, but DM was the first to make a whole band out of samplers, and as such, no one else sounded like them. but, this horrible new trend that started with Violator, ran god-aweful into Ultra and OWILM, has now taken over Exciter. the whole CD is done with the same drum-boxes and 'shake-n-bake' drums beats that every other techno/dance/club/house band is using out there, and there's nothing memorable in the whole album. there's no originality to this whole album ('cept \\"Dead of Night\\", but that goes back to that trite lyrics thing).<br />i suppose, every decent band changes, i guess i just don't like what's happened to DM.

B000002JK4|5.0|The 1980s held so much promise for Led Zeppelin. Their final album had shown they could make the transition into the digitally-minded decade with ease by toning down the guitar attack in favor of lush keyboards. However, drummer John Bonham's death silenced that notion and the surviving members decided to carry on alone. No surprise, Robert Plant, being the most visible member of Zeppelin, found solo success first. His 1982 debut PICTURES AT ELEVEN sold well thanks to his previous fame with Zeppelin, even peaking at #5 on the charts without a high-selling single. But that album seemed to say that Plant still missed the heavy blues-rock that Zeppelin had all but pioneered. With the follow-up PRINCIPLE OF MOMENTS, Robert probably decided to sever ties with his past once and for all. Indeed, MOMENTS introduces a more pop-oriented facet to Plant's personality, and like the keyboard-based departure that was IN THROUGH THE OUT DOOR, it works surprisingly well. The album generated 2 top 40 hits for Plant: the simple yet infectious \\"In The Mood\\" and the moody, introspective \\"Big Log\\". This was probably due to the airy soundscapes that producers Benji Lefeure, Pat Moran, and Plant himself bring to songs that may have also worked had Jimmy Page had a hand in them. \\"Mood\\" proves that blues-shouter Plant could convincingly sing mellow pop, while \\"Big Log\\" maintains the mystery of Zeppelin's best work, although some have said it is Robert Plant having a conversation with God (maybe about John Bonham's death), so who knows? Hinting at Led Zeppelin's underrated willingness to experiment, PRINCIPLE OF MOMENTS has its share of more left-field ditties like the eerie \\"Stranger Here...Than Over There\\", \\"Messin' With The Mekon\\" and \\"Thru With The Two-Step\\". Plant hasn't lost his tendency for abstract song titles, and their intention at sparking discussion among music fans is indeed a successful one. The closest things to all-out rockers on MOMENTS are \\"Other Arms\\" and \\"Horizontal Departure\\", proving that Robert Plant doesn't need to be reflective all of the time. While the keyboard playing by Jezz Woodroffe would be the most obvious highlight of MOMENTS, the percussion work should be equally noted. While John Bonham's tubthumping drumwork is missed for sure, the slightly understated sound of it on MOMENTS works just as well. Phil Collins and ex-Jethro Tull skinsman Barriemore Barlow give the songs a supple backbeat that even Bonzo himself may have appreciated. PRINCIPLE OF MOMENTS was as big a success as its predecessor PICTURES AT ELEVEN, becoming a top 5 hit at a time when the charts were still geared towards artists who were a generation younger than Plant. Whether or not it was due to Robert Plant's legendary work with Zeppelin or the album's own merits is unclear. But it still went a long way in establishing Robert Plant as an engaging solo artist in his own right. And for anyone who knocks the follow-up SHAKEN N' STIRRED for being too keyboard-driven, they should listen to PRINCIPLE OF MOMENTS to realize that the more production-based approach was coming anyway.ure\\", proving that Robert Plant doesn't need to be reflective all of the time.

B000002UAU|5.0|Sgt. Pepper is not my favourite Beatles album (that would be Revolver), but it is close.  Without a doubt one of the best albums of all time and filled with some of the best songs ever recorded.  From the initial riffs of &quot;Sgt.

B00003CWTI|4.0|Anderson takes a stab at critics who say this film is too long in this DVD edition. But, really, Paul, they've got a point. <br />Now, I don't want to detract from this film's good points. There are many. The opening sequence is fantastic. It does what opening sequences should - get your complete attention. Tom Cruise, I hate to say, is terrific. So is the rest of the cast, particularly Jason Robards and Phil Hoffman. Speaking of which, Jason Robards' monolgoue near the end of this film is an actor's dream. It's a remarkable piece of writing. <br />However, there comes a point in this film where you start to feel your chair. And that's when you realize : &quot;This is taking too long.&quot; This film could have been trimmed by twenty minutes pretty easily, and it would've been just as strong, if not more so. <br />As for the DVD, there's some good extras in here worth enjoying.<br />This is not a bad addition to any film library, and will probably be used to teach film students their craft someday. Worth buying...
078324228X|3.0|It's strange how I knew exactly how this film was going to end but I still wanted it to end that way.  An uplifting type of film that everybody has already seen countless times, although Jewison employs an intricate chronology in the storytelling that made things more interesting than expected.  Denzel Washington, as always, is a treat to watch.  As for the controversy surrounding the film, I just want to quickly say that there shouldn't be one.
0064471837|5.0|The Preparation  Sabriel... it was the name of the book that first caught my attention... but it was the story within the book that held it.  For a long time I had been aware of this book, but had been put off by the cover picture; that black shadowy thing (behind the girl on the cover) with yellow eyes and black teeth and claws rather repulsed me. Then I finally decided I'd read it, cover illustration or no, and borrowed the book from my local library.  Let me tell you, this book hooked me ever so quickly. The Epilogue confused me, though, but only because I wasn't familiar with any of the terms that it contained (e.g. charter signs, charter mage, etc.). However, after I began to read the story more, the terms didn't trouble me and I was completely wrapped up in the book. I must warn you, though, that this book - while it's very gripping and suspenseful - is rather morbid as it deals quite often with the dead and the land of the dead. As a book, the images this story creates are vivid while not being too repulsing. However, as a movie I shudder to think what horrible images could be created! So I suggest that this book probably isn't appropriate for kids who are younger than 11 or 12.<br />The Story Okay, now to what the story is about: This story is about a girl, called Sabriel, whose father is Abhorsen (which is really more of a title than a name). You see, the Abhorsen is dedicated to sending the living dead back into death, rather the opposite of what a necromancer (a person who brings the dead back to life) would do. Thus, his (or her) job is very dangerous as things that have come back from the dead are usually very evil.  Before too long it becomes apparent that Abhorsen is dead, or merely trapped in death, and (naturally) Sabriel knows she must go and save her father and perhaps even bring him back from the dead, if need be. It quickly becomes apparent that Sabriel will have to do much more than just rescue her father, but rescue the whole Old Kingdom as well! And it sounds like a very daunting task!  As she journeys with Mogget (and later Mogget and Touchstone) she finds that there are Dead and the Dead's victims everywhere, and the whole Old Kingdom seems to be in shambles. The excitement in this story is never far away and the reader never suffers a dull moment (i.e. if you're not recuperating from an adrenalin pumping brush with death, you're encountering one). So I recommend this book to all who love a fantasy that is exhilarating and suspenseful, magical and realistic (as far as a good fantasy can be), and spin-chilling and heart-warming.ll!

It's one of a Kind.
B00003CXRP|5.0|Everyone who has seen the trailer, I suppose, knows that he makes it back at the end of the film -- which many viewers didn't like.  I would offer an observation that not many have mentioned.  There are two scenes in the movie in which Hanks' character looks in each of the cardinal directions.  The first of these occurs at the top of the island: he looks north, south, east, and west... seeing nothing except water.  He is alone on the island, and there is no solace.  The second of the two occurs near the end of the film at the crossroads: he looks again in each direction and sees nothing but land.  Loneliness in all but one direction, and that is the direction he settles on.  I don't think this was thrown in as the Hollywood crowd-pleaser... this ending had some depth.
B00003CXN4|4.0|On the film : It's very well done. This is an engaging film and will be watched several times before you're done giving it thought. Del Toro turns in a solid performance, as does the rest of the cast. No one does ensemble casting like Soderbergh these days. The only weak point to the film, in my opinion, is the story line with the new drug czar's daughter. In a sense, it is the heart of the film. But it also occassionally smells of old morality tales, and I find myself having to overcome my distaste for those. It just seems too conveniently \\"horrible.\\" <br><br>As for the DVD : Disappointing extras. Usually Soderbergh DVD's have a nice helping of extras and special features. \\"Out of Sight\\" and \\"The Limey\\" are jam-packed. This DVD has a rather dull \\"Making of...\\". No commentary, no deleted scenes. I expected more, and there should have been more.<br><br>Overall - It's a film worth having. But give the DVD a second thought before you buy it.....
6304626495|5.0|This movie is amazing. It mixes the python's unique but hillarious blend of humor with biting religious satire to create a true comedic masterpiece. The end sequence featuring all the curcified people singing is one of the best scenes in movie history. This movie manages to make fun of Christianity, political groups, and conformity without ever really being rude. Just honest. And damned FUNNY! Who would have imagined Pilat with a speach impetement and a friend named Biggus Dickus? These guys were geniuses and true innovators. The movie is still as important as it was then and still as funny. If you're looking for thoughtprovoking humor, rather than most of the mindless highschool comedy out there today, check this out. you won't regret it!
B00004XOWM|1.0|i was really looking forward to the release of this cd, and when i finally got it i was *extremely* disappointed. dont get me wrong, im a huge limp bizkit fan, but this is just not anywhere close to the quality of three dollar bill yall$ or significant other. if it was possible for me to give it less than one star i would because theyve gotten so much worse since their debut. pass on this one and buy something that youll listen to all the way through. try some pod or deftones if you like their older stuff, youll be much better off.
0380789019|4.0|Gaiman is one of the last, best storytellers in the history of the fantasy genre.  It's wonderful to see a writer whose stories are both imaginative and accessible in a field that seems to prize quantity over quality.  This particular novel is packed with imagination, showcasing one strange, funny concept after another, all within the framework of a classic reluctant hero's quest.  That said, not all of the charming, interesting concepts are Gaiman's own.  It becomes obvious after a few pages that Gaiman owes a remarkably large debt to both Fritz Leiber's The Sinful Ones and Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast trilogy.  Indeed, the initial conceit of The Sinful One's resembles Neverwhere a little too closesly for comfort.  These are fairly minor quibbles, honestly.  Gaiman, at least, has the decency to borrow from the best, and he learns as he writes; everything after Good Omens (his novel with Terry Pratchett) is funnier, everything after The Sandman takes itself a little less seriously.  It's good to see an author who focuses on self-improvement over self-aggrandizement, and Gaiman is improving at a fantastic rate.  All in all, one could do considerably worse than to borrow from J.G. Ballard James Branch Cabell, and Gaiman makes ample and innovative use of his lessons.  Read Neverwhere.  You won't be disappointed.  And maybe you'll follow Gaiman's tacit advice and visit the forgotten masters that he so obviously loves.
6304297912|5.0|A great movie, for entertainment,laughs, or a very attractive renton[Ewan Mcgregor]shines in this movie. A Favorite of mine!! I reccomend you Watch it!
B00003CXSP|1.0|This is my explanation concerning &quot;Hannibal&quot;. I totally dislike stories that are not plausible. Make no sense. Are just put together to justify another means. <br />Lecter came back to America to &quot;help&quot; Starling out with her dilemma regarding her suspension. Like he could really do anything. It makes more sense for him to have returned because of his &quot;love&quot; for her. Which he is. Now the infamous &quot;dinner scene&quot; was just an insult to my intelligence. First off, he &quot;fixes&quot; up Clarice and her bullet wound. Fine. Gave the appropriate drugs to help her pain and healing. She wakes up and finds, very nice and neat, on the desk all her stuff. Cuffs, money...etc. Too convienent. Lecter disconnects the phone because he knew Clarice's nature would be to try to call the police. Why did he not just rip the phone off the wall to ensure no outside intruders? He just disconnected it where a child could put it together very easily. Clarice make the call to the cops and that limits Lecter from having &quot;quality&quot; time with her, which he has been aching to have. Remember, he does love her in his own sick way. He literally has only minutes to be with her before he has to escape. WHY? He is so smart and in love with her. He would never let that happen where she would call for help. He wants to eat the guy's brain and talk with Clarice. If he is to convince her to love him, without the use of drugs, he needs TIME...period. Time he did not allow himself to have.<br />Now the cops are on their way. Time is short. He traps her with her hair and the fridge and ask if she could ever love him. The OBVIOUS answer is NO, NO, NO. Why would she? Dumb on Lecter's part. Makes no sense. He needed time and or drugs to get his way with Clarice. So he can hear the answer he longs for. If &quot;no&quot; is the obvious answer, maybe he never should of come to America, but I will talk about that in detail a little later in this writing. Let me go backa little now. <br />In &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, the thing that I liked a lot about Jodie Foster's performance is that she was respectful of Lecter but, immensely afraid of him. Even between 6 to 10 inches of glass or steel bars separating them. She feared Lecter, which made me fear Lecter. Watch the movie again and see what I mean. Total fear yet controlled and respectful. I was scared everytime she spoke with him. In &quot;Hannibal&quot;, Clarice is actually face to face with her worst nightmare and totally unafraid. This guy would in a second eat your face off and she attacks him like he is the bully neighbor you grew up with. She was drugged, I understand, but she was relentless the whole time. If a big dog chased me and I had a gun, I am brave because of the weapon yet I still would be afraid. The foreign cop guy in the beginning of the movie was afraid of him but, very greedy and it cost him his life. A great performance by him by the way. Clarice tried to get him with a knife and fist and then cuffs. She was relentless. It made me not afraid of Lecter. We all should be. He is capable of ANYTHING.<br />Finally, Lecter escapes by mere moments from the police, minus one left hand. We are talking moments. Seconds. He is on the 10 most wanted list. Everyone in America is after him. All the airports have his picture, the state line, the damn Mexican border. His likeness is out there plus the now distinguishing mark of a missing left hand. Yet, he is able to board a plane for overseas, no problem. I am to assume he is on the plane days later after the dinner scene. It's not like he was in hiding for a while to let the &quot;heat&quot; die down. No disguise and no left hand to the airport for a flight overseas. I defy you to walk across the street after robbing the local 7-11 and get you hand cut off and be able to board a plane for anywhere. STUPID, STUPID, STUPID. That part makes no sense. Even if he dressed like a priest, all people with cast, or splints, or missing left hands would be questioned by airport officials. <br />I like the beginning of the movie. It's after he arrived to America, the movie goes downhill. The writers take liberties and assume we must be on the slow side.<br />Here is an overview: 1) Lecter comes to America to help Clarice. (The writers needed a reason for Lecter to be in America to fight Gary Oldman's character, Mason Verger.) 2) Let's Clarice call the cops. (Writers needed a reason for him to flee the scene rapidly and escape for a another possible sequel.) 3) He asks Clarice if she could love him? ( This one the writers put there to explain the reason why he came for her. Bad choice as I have explained earlier. She is gonna say no. Why should she say yes? Hence, he never should of come to america or he should kidnap Clarice to have her do his bidding. ) 4) Clarice not being the least bit afraid. (Bad acting choice by Ms. Moore.) 5) Lecter's quick, &quot;one handed&quot; escape. (See #2) The writer's needed to wrap everything up nice and neat. &quot;Let's make our opening weekend $59,000,000 and run to the bank.&quot; Whatever happened to solid stories and character motivations? By the way, him cutting off his hand is PROOF that he loved her. DEFINITIVE PROOF.) 6) All that extra gore was cool, but I believe that the writer's mentality is: &quot;People will talk about the excessive gore more than they will about the weak plot points the movie has.&quot; There are many. Ask anyone about the movie and what is the first thing said? You know that answer. Gore, gore, brains and more gore. <br />I like stories that make sense. Please make sense. Keep it simple and honest and consistent to real life regardless of the extreme circumstances.
B000053V7Q|5.0|If there was ever any doubt on who was the greatest stage performer, please watch this DVD, and you will have no doubt.  E lights it up from the beginning to the end.  I was tired at the end, just from watching it.  This DVD really shows E the way he was.  Too bad Graceland is only inhabited by tourists, now.  It would be great to see E live on the stage, again!
B000002I99|4.0|YEAH, THIS IS A VERY GOOD ALBUM. NOT PERFECT- AS SOME OF THE MATERIAL IS A BIT WEAK AND MISPLACED IN TERS OF THE CONCEPT. THAT ASIDE IT IS A GREAT ONE. BUT WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO PUT MY 2 CENTS IN ON IS THE  ONGOING COMPARISON OF MR. COOPER AND MARILYN MANSON. FOR THE  RECORD: THEY ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT PERFORMERS WITH COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MUSICAL APPROACHES AND STYLES. ONE IS AN ACCOMPLISHED SONGWRITER, HUMORIST, HARMONICA PLAYER, AND A DAMN GOOD SINGER WITH AN AMAZING VOCAL RANGE, WHILE THE OTHER IS A NO  TALENT AT ANY STRETCH. THE ONLY COMMON FACTOR IS THAT BOTH USE MORBID SUBJECT MATTER.. THAT'S  IT.  GRANTED, ALICE WAS A TRUE ORIGINAL WITH MAKING HALLOWEEN AN ALL YEAR ROUND HOLLIDAY,  A CONCEPT WHICH MANSON HAS RIPPED OFF AND EXPLOITED, BUT HAS NOT EVEN COME ANYWHERE NEAR THE LIKES OF COOPER IN TERMS OF CREATIVITY, IMMAGINATION, THEATRICS, OR LYRICISM AS EVIDENCED BY ALBUMS SUCH AS W.T.M.N. AND COOPER'S STAGE PRODUCTION OF HIS HEYDEY. . I SUPPOSE BY COMMON RATIONALE ONE COULD ASSUME THAT  JIMI HENDRIX AND BB KING ARE ONE AND THE SAME BECAUSE BOTH ARE BLACK AND BOTH PLAY(ED) A MEAN GUITAR, BUT THE MUSICAL STYLES AND TECHNIQUES ARE QUITE DIFFERENT. DO ALICE A FAVOR AND LEAVE  THE ANTICHRIST STUPIDSTAR IN A SEPARATE CATEGORY. THERE IS A LOT MORE TO COOPER THAN JUST A SPOOKFEST: SONG STRUCTURE, CONCEPTMELODIC SONGS, DIVERSITY OF INFLUENCES,  BALLADS, HUMOR, AND THE STAGE SHOW PRESENTATION OF THE SPECTACULAR COOPER CONCERTS OF THE 70'S .NOT JUST AN EMPTY FREAKSHOW CONCOCTED AS OVERBLOWN FLUFF ACT FOR AN UNTALENTED PERFRMER, AS WELCOME TO MY NIGHTMARE CLEARLY PROVES.
B00005B4GU|3.0|before you judge that im one of those &quot;listen to creep everynight&quot; radiohead fans. ok computer took rock music to another level and remains my favourite album ever but my favourite music is hip hop, dance and folky stuff. whereas &quot;kid A&quot; was the peacefull sleep, this is the bad trip and they work well together in that respect.i was a little gutted with kid A at first but know recognise how remarkable it is. radioheads chillout album. but in the most part is like a factory in process. and not in the way leftfield do it so well. amnesiac epitomises the phrase difficult like the records &quot;adore&quot; by the pumpkins and &quot;without you im nothing&quot; by placebo. you feel that what you are listening too is &quot;probably&quot; genius but the shift in direction is so great that you end up confused. 1st track like &quot;like sardines packt.......&quot; is a fairly competent track though i dont have the intigue of the 1st track on kid A (everything in its right place) which was haunting and very interesting with its use of vocal trickery. &quot;the pyramid song&quot; is one of the radiohead greats. a beautifull melody which is made by the use the eastern sample. &quot;pulk&quot; is deep into &quot;radiohead experimaent world and is facinating on first listen but is so flimsy that interest soon vanishes on the 3rd or 4th listen. &quot;you and whose army&quot; is the albums second best tracks and is like a remarkable bastardisation of &quot;karma police&quot;, similer to what nirvana did to &quot;smells like teen spirit&quot; with &quot;rape me&quot; could have done with being a little longer. the tracks &quot;i might be wrong&quot; &quot;knives out&quot; (which reminds me of a freaked out version of &quot;coldplays&quot; -&quot;dont panic&quot; and &quot;dollars and cents&quot; are all fairlydecent tracks , but seeming as though the hype for the record was built on the basis of these songs, they let me down a little. amnesiacs take on &quot;morning bell is also one of the albums high points. much better than the Kid A version its like a funeral march and one of yorkes best use of vocals ever. after this the album completely collapses. &quot;hunting bears&quot; and &quot;like spinning plates&quot; are bad and not even tracks. similer to the stuff richard D James does but not a patch on it. &quot;life in a glass house&quot; is a mess. the jazz section is papp and makes a bad track worse. humphrey lyttleton is a ledgend at what he does but radiohead seem like they are just doing it cos they can. many moons ago, thom yorke said as OK computer went mental, that he felt that radiohead we not pushing music along as the likes of aphex twin are. well where are radiohead taking music by emulating what he has done? yorkes recent admision that he misses the guitars is a good thing. alot of you new stuff has been amonst their best work but the PROGRESSIVE rock is what i think they know they do best.this new direction hasnt changed my opinion that they are still the greatest set of musicians ever to play together. hey even the beatles had their weird moments! roll on kid C. hope this review has been helpfull.
B00001U03Q|4.0|If you expect this album to chronicle Clapton's career from the beginning you will be dissapointed.  The tracks cover the years 1985-1999, and include most of his biggest hits from those years such as the catchy &quot;It's in the Way that You Use It&quot; and the fiery &quot;Bad Love.&quot;  This album also includes three soundtrack songs that have never appeared on a Clapton disc before this.  &quot;Change the World&quot; of course is the smash theme from the '96 movie Phenomenon and features real solid acoustic playing from Slowhand,  &quot;Blue Eyes Blues&quot; is a slow ballad complete with swirling violins, which appeared in the '99 movie Runaway Bride,and &quot;(I) Get Lost&quot; from the '99 movie The Story of Us is an uptempo song that has a techno sound(somewhat out of nature for a bluesman like Clapton) but the song features a well played Spanish guitar which proves that Clapton still can play any style of guitar he wants.  The rest of the album can be dismissed as just pop from the late '80s and '90s, but Clapton's guitar always comes through especially on his rendition of the blues standard &quot;Before You Accuse Me&quot;-just when you think that Clapton has sold himself to pop he breaks out a finger numbing solo on this great blues tune from his '89 album Journeymen.  But if you want to hear any other great solos from the GOD you will be disapointed, Clapton's fiery early career is not represented, but it would be hard to chronicle all of Clapton's highs on one album.  Therefore this album should be purchased along with &quot;Cream of Clapton&quot; in order to hear Eric at his best.  And even then The great album &quot;Money and Cigarettes&quot; is not represented-even with the song &quot;I've Got a Rock and Roll Heart&quot; that's the only addition I would make to this album.  The only deletion i would make would be &quot;River of Tears&quot; it is such a mournful and long song that does not offer much.  Instead of that 7 minute tune I would have putin either &quot;Sick and Tired&quot; from his Pilgrim cd or &quot;Motherless Child&quot; from his From the Cradle.  Other than those slight qualms this album is great and it is a perfect for a casual admirer of Clapton or an old fan who needs to get reaquainted with Clapton's new style.  I highly recommend this great compilation.
0767903862|1.0|Bill Bryson explains in the first two paragraphs that the title of his latest work - &quot;In a Sunburned Country&quot; - should have been &quot;In a Sunburnt Country,&quot; a line of familiar and well-loved poetry borrowed from Australia's own Dorothea Mackellar. It should have been, but isn't. &quot;I know it should,&quot; he writes, &quot;but it isn't.&quot; And there you have it.<br />Released to coincide with the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, the book was intended as travel literature. Again, it isn't. It is, more than anything else, a vague and vaguely dispiriting record of Mr. Bryson's hop-scotch across the southernmost continent, which, he notes at every turn in the road, is very big, very hot and very far away.<br />There IS much to learn - to be fair - about Australian pubs, and Bryson's energetic eating and drinking habits. Tourist sites are well documented, degrees of tackiness carefully noted. Museums of every size and purpose proliferate like Australian rabbits. Motels emerge as major metaphors.<br />Not nearly as common are Australians - real people with real names and stories to tell. That is particularly true (and egregious) if they are black. Aboriginal Australians are most commonly described as being out of sight. A result, perhaps, of being out of Mr. Bryson's mind.<br />Mr. Bryson has taken earlier shortcuts with readers. He continues to contend, even in the flyleaf of &quot;Sunburned Country&quot;, that he walked &quot;most of&quot; the Appalachian trail, an adventure he captured in &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot;. The truth is that, by his own reckoning, he walked 870 miles. The trail stretches out over 2200 miles. That works out to a little less than 40 percent. Which is, of course, no small accomplishment. But most of it? No. It isn't.<br />There are also the matters of tortured syntax (alternating American and British idiom), an unfortunate affinity for the vulgar anecdote and Mr. Bryson's general unpleasantness in the company of hotel and pub employees. None of that adds much.<br />Altogether an unfortunate outing for Mr. Bryson.
6305538018|2.0|I refuse to write the title of this film in that weird eXistenZ kind of way...oops, I just did.  The title is just one annoying aspect of many in the film, which plays like some kind of nerd fantasy involving lots of weird technology crap and Jennifer Jason Leigh in a miniskirt.  The film begins when Allegra (Leigh), a world-famous game designer, survives an attack from a would-be assasin during a company demo of her new game, eXistenZ.  Ted (Jude Law), a PR agent-in-training for the company (and her temporary bodyguard) whisks her away to a motel to hide out.  In order to test whether her game (a revolting, squirming flesh pod thing with an umbilical cord...yum) has been damaged in the attack, she must test it out with someone friendly.  After Ted is installed with a BioPort, the two can enter into eXistenZ to see whether the game has been damaged.  Unfortunately, things get pretty freaky and soon it becomes difficult to discern between reality and the game.  For the rest of the film Allegra must give Ted dangerous come-hither looks from under her eyelashes, and he must shoot waiters and yell, &quot;something doesn't feel right!&quot; periodically.<br />Hmmm...what to say, what to say?  Oh yeah: yuck.  This movie lacked any kind of a coherent plot and contained a few too many bloody animal parts for my taste.  Jude Law is even kind of boring in this one (oh, except when he slurps the head off of a mutant frog snake...thing). Mostly he just whines at Jennifer Jason Leigh in a bad American accent (but this CAN be forgiven as he was an excellent American in 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' and he is my favorite actor.)  Jason Leigh just seems tired and PO'd for most of the film, although her hair is quite stylish.  All in all, this movie has great special effects and very realistic fake blood and organs.  See it if you like sci-fi.  It's not terrible--just a little too stylishly bizarre.
B00000JGEI|5.0|The bomb.Keeps you on the edge of your seat! awesome for surrond sound. a must-buy. aewsome plot.
B000001IPL|5.0|This is definitely one of The Offsprings' best CDs although it is closely followed by Ignition another of their albums. I can almost always listen to this CD and never get sick of it. My favorite tracks are Gotta Get Away, Genocide, Something to Believe In, Not the One, and Smash. The other tracks are also very good. The only that isn't too great, in my opinion, is So Alone. If you're thinking about buying and Offspring CD, this is the one. It will not disappoint you!
B000002UVZ|5.0|When I first bought this record vinyl, it juz blew me away. It was unlike Murmur which was more accoustic. Begin the Begin was filled with such agnst &amp; aggressive. Cuyahoga was even better. Overall, this fine album deserved more than 5 stars. I've even replaced my collection of the earlier aging REM records to CD, Murmur, Fables of the Reconstruction,Document,Reckoning.   Buy this record
B00000DFMM|5.0|Propaganda's first album, &quot;A Secret Wish&quot;, proves to be one of the most important and groundbreaking albums of the 80s. Even over a decade after it's release, none of the tracks sound outdated or old-fashioned. If you're into 80s and electronic music, &quot;A Secret Wish&quot; is a must-have and not-to-be-missed album. (pity the 10 minute version of &quot;Dr Mabuse&quot; is not on it though... it's the ultime 12&quot; version)
B00000K32J|3.0|I do love the dancing but I have to say I found the costumes of the production much gaudier and less atractive than the first version. The taping is better but the show looks sooo tacky at points it was laughable. I'm not apurist I love the show and I have been an Irish dancer for about 15 years. At one point the gypsy girl comes out in this god awful red cat suit looking like some villinous from the 1960's Batman TV series..very tacky. And Dair Nolan looked like he hated wearing that ridculous cape! As a dancer what idiot would want to dance with a cape flapping about your body? I do prefer this tape to the Orginal LOTD but I still think Flatley needs to work on his costume ideas. I have done dance shows and you need to not make the costumes so flashy that it ditracts from the lovely dancing. He needs to TONE IT DOWN!
B000NQRE1E|5.0|To all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue, the budget, the this and the that... who wants to hear it? IF you missed the point of this phenomenal movie, that is your loss. The rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think. I am a grown man and I have seen thousands of movies in my life. This one stands in its own entity in my book. It was not supposed to be a documentary or a factual account of what happened that week. It was the greatest love story ever attempted. I know that it is the cynical new millennium, but come on. Someone complained that it made too much money at the box office! How lame is that? It made an extravagant amount of money at the box office in every civilized country on the planet and became one of the highest grossing films of all time. I will gladly side with the majority this time around. Okay you cynics, it's time to crawl back under your rock. I am done.
0140866884|5.0|Like many of Stephen King's more recent works, Wizard and Glass is long. While some people find many of these epic works to be somewhat self-indulgent on King's part, I very much enjoy the incredible depth of the stories. Although they have plenty of deviations from the plot (and to this end Wizard and Glass is no exception) the digressions are nevertheless quite interesting and help to paint a more thorough picture to a fascinating tale. Although Stephen King is a competent writer, his incredible imagination is his greatest asset. Wizard and Glass, as well as the rest of the Dark Tower series, represents Stephen King's imagination at its best.<br />With the exception of book three (which for some reason appears to be unavailable on audio) I have thoroughly enjoyed Frank Muller's rendition of the Dark Tower series. At first I found his voice more than a little irritating and thought there was no way I'd make it through one tape, much less a whole book. Initially his voice comes across as somewhat throaty and melodramatic, but not only did I grow used to it, but now I quite like it. It really captures the mystical quality of the Dark Tower series, and now whenever I hear Frank Muller's voice, the first word that comes to my mind is \\"Gunslinger.\\"
B00000K19E|5.0|No need to ramble about how awesome this movie is, so I'll keep it short and sweet.<br />-Watch this movie and watch it again and again. -Best action movie ever! -The reason DVD was created was to showcase a movie like this. Digital Sound and Picture has found it's poster child!
0375402675|5.0|Im sorry for all you people that do not believe this book was excellent, but, you are undoubtably wrong. This was one of his best books ever. Talk about an awsome plot, it always leaves you to want to keep reading. If you like counter-terror action, this is the book for you.(ie: a paintball player would love this book!!!!!). I would read this book again. I wish they made it into a movie. It would be excellent!!! The missions are lifelike, and make you wonder if there really is a covert team like them. IT COULD BE POSSIBLE!!!!! Clark plays an outstanding role, along with Dimitry Popov. GOOD JOB TO CLANCY ON THIS ONE!!!
0380973464|5.0|Believably hilarious and tragic characters, canny observations of our intra- and inter-cultural customs and quirks, a factually rich and constantly evolving plot, and a fluid, dynamic prosaic style make this novel hard to put down. Stephenson weaves a surreal transgenerational mystery, while skillfully lampooning several of society's sacred cows. A must-read.
B00005IBGQ|5.0|His first album was a landmark album to me and was certainly hard to top or even equal. Expectations were very high for me but when I saw him live a few weeks before the cd release, I knew 'Poses' wouldn't be a disappointment. And indeed june 5th was a happy day as I listened to the album without end. Every song on there is a gem and the new direction Rufus has taken is just great. You can see he wanted to add more to his sound, more textures and variety. He did that with success and that's pretty much all I can say. Such beautiful things shouldn't be talked about.
B00000IAU3|5.0|If you have never heard of Dido, you're missing out on an amazing talent. Beautifully written lyrics & Haunting Melodies. \\"Here With Me\\" the first single has been used on a pleathera of tv dramas, most well known as the theme song to Roswell. With \\"Thank You\\"'s success and the new single \\"Hunter\\" having come out recently, you are definately missing out if you haven't at least given this album a listen. I strongly recommend this album!! It's one I can play over and over again and continue to enjoy.<BR>I guarantee if you enjoy singers like Beth Orton, Sarah McLachlan, Jewel, Tori Amos and so on then you will probably enjoy Dido. Pick it up, it'll probably be your new favorite album.
B00003CXN4|2.0|What were the studios thinking when they designed this DVD?  It was like it was made in 1993 or something.  I've gone more exciting DVD title screens from movies I bought for $10.00.  Beside that the hoopla about Traffic was not at ALL warranted.  The movie was WAY TOO LONG!!!!!!  It was like someone got a hold of a bad movie of the week mini series and decided to put it in a feature film.  The transparent efforts to make this movie&quot;artsy&quot; were a TOTAL waste and just made the movie look worse than it all ready did.  This movie was truly unsurprising and I could have probably told you the end by the middle.  It was TRULY a WASTE of my time.  PLEASE DON'T EVEN RENT THIS MOVIE!!!  It will be a portion of your life you'll never get back.  It certainly depressed me...
B00005B4GU|5.0|song #3 is one of the best things my ears have ever experienced.
B00000JPH5|5.0|I saw it once it was ten years ago and now I bought it. It was just the same I have left it in my memory. I just cannot tell you how excited I am. At last I have MY favourite movie at home. If you haven't seen Labyrinth you haven't seen nothing at all. I mean it. Labyrinth is the same value as Star Wars. They both are unforgettable classic. these movies are made without computers and special effects as we know them. You must watch and understand how hard it was to make this incredible fantasy. It is still THE BEST BEST BEST!!
B00003CXDZ|3.0|This movie is just as color-saturated and overflowing visually as most reviews have stated.  The acting is appropriate, and I expected to love it, but the songs were a letdown.  Either they went on interminably (&quot;Your Song&quot;), or they are truncated to just a few seconds (&quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;) or they are just dull (too many to mention).  This is no &quot;Grease.&quot;  Maybe the soundtrack CD is better, but as a musical, it just wasn't catchy.  Still, at least it makes an effort to do something artistic, unlike a lot of the crap in theaters.
B000009EAD|2.0|Gotta let you guys know, this album is a dissapointment.  Stand Alone completely rips off Metallica's Blackened.  10 mediocre tracks, not very memorable.  I'd skip this one.
0808586165|5.0|I was first given this book in the seventh grade. I was mesmorized and finished in a night. Right after, I bought all the sequals and read them too. Since then I have read the book several times and have joined the Philotic web to talk with others who loved this book as well. Trust me. When you read this book you will love and most likely think it's the best book you have ever read.ENDER'S GAME ROCKS!
0767819446|5.0|When I was offered to see the film. I thought that it would be a disaster - medium budget, unknown actors etc. But i was really glad that I watched it. There is only one word - COOL. do not hesitate, just buy and enjoy!!
B00004SCS1|5.0|And we have a new uncrowned king! Truly, amongst all the recent MTV pimpled teen stars and the feminism growing across the almighty America, a group like &quot;System of A Down&quot; feels like a breath of fresh air. They're not as mellow as Tool, Staind, Lifehouse trio, and  at the same time their heaviness does not choke the music. System of a down incorporates in itself excellent lyrics (written by vocalist Tankian, watch for his new book of poems), aggressive political satire and cynism a-la &quot;Rage Against...&quot; plus bone-crushing heavy music and roaring vocals. <br />I cannot wait for the new release of this Armenian band, and I know it won't be a repetition of a disappointing &quot;StaticX - Machine&quot; album.
6305841861|5.0|This film is always a fun treat to watch, non-stop thrills, chills, and laughs.  You'll moan in disgust and then before your done exhaling you'll be laughing till your sides split (literally).  Ash is the greatest anti-hero EVER!  Who else can slay demons, devils, and witches with a shotgun in one hand and chainsaw mounted on the other? Especially after having a real bad day like - killing your girlfriend (twice), being thrown out of a car, kicked repeatedly, chased by unseen demons, and cutting off your own possessed hand, not anyone that I can think of.  Chock full of blood, guts, monsters, killer dialog, and impressive special effects, a very fun movie time and again - and what an ending!  By far the best of the trilogy and a fantastic DVD package.

B000002H97|4.0|The Black Album was basically the album that brought Metallica to mainstream stardom. Unfortunately, it is also the album that created a lot of controversy among fans who were already listening to the band back in the eighties because of its softer, more radio friendly sound. And why not? After all, the album had a lot of pre-release hype, a lot of radio airplay, and a lot of MTV airplay. For some, this plus a band that once vowed to never do a video for MTV equalled &quot;Sell out.&quot; But when Metallica made that vow, I don't think even they realized how successful they were going to be. And Justice For All was able to reach the top ten on the billboard charts very shortly after its release and the glam metal scene Metallica once rebelled against was basically dead and gone by the early nineties. Metallica would have been foolish not to get at least a little mainstream exposure and MTV knew it. That's why they were all over Metallica to &quot;Join their sinful kind&quot; and become one of their biggest bands. Metallica, having nowhere else to go at the time, agreed to it and the Black Album was created. <br />The Black Album, of course, was quite a departure from previous Metallica efforts. The songs were shorter, they were for the most part more groove-oriented, and there were only two songs that could really be considered &quot;thrashy&quot; (Struggle Within and Through The Never). Nonetheless, the album was definitely a big stepping stone for the band and the start of a new generation for them. However, as the title suggests, I personally feel this album has been over played and over exposed. Case in point: Enter Sandman. This is probably Metallica's most famous song with the mainstream. And because of that, most mainstream music fans will base their initial opinions of the band off that one song. Unfortunately, their most famous song does not equal their best song. As a general rock song it's great. But Metallica's talent is much more evident in songs like MOP's Orion and Load's Hero Of The Day than Enter Sandman. It's a bit sad that this had to be the song that made Metallica a momentary mainstream sensation. Also, it seemed James was trying a bit too hard with the singing voice on this album. It sounds very forced and even a little annoying at times (the afformentioned Struggle Within for example). By contrast, on the later Load he sounded much more confident and sure of himself. <br />As for the other songs, they basically range from being good to just plain boring. The good songs include Of Wolf And Man, The God That Failed (one of those rare occasions where Newsted's bass guitaring actually gets some of the credit it deserves), Sad But True, Wherever I May Roam (awesome riff), and My Friend of Misery. The boring songs, however, include Holier Than Thou (a lyrical rewrite of MOP's Leper Messiah), Don't Tread on Me (cool lyrical writing yet boring instrumentation), and The Unforgiven. That's right, The Unforgiven. I know a lot of people loved that song, but I personally didn't. I felt it had a very annoying solo (sounding too Ted Nugent-like) and it just seemed like it was trying way too hard to sound poignant and emotional, making the song more irritating than enjoyable for me.  <br />Overall, I do like this album. In fact, there was once a time when I loved it. But after a while, I basically became less and less into it. Partially because the songs were growing stale. Partially because I was just sick of all the mainstream attention it got. It's definitely a good buy, but I wouldn't recommend it as a first Metallica album for newcomers to the band.
B00005B4GU|5.0|very much like it's predecessor Kid A, you'll have to take time to let this album really grow on you.  every track here shines with the brilliance of Radiohead, but it's often imperative to give the songs more than just one listen before you make your decisions on whether you like it or not.  personally, i didn't much share the appreciation for &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors&quot; like other fans, but after repeated listenings, this has quickly become one of the 11 highlights on the entire album (and yes, there are 11 tracks...meaning all the songs are essentially highlights) <br />now i just can't wait for the grammy awards!  amnesiac is sure to be nominated at LEAST!  so in a word: this is Perfection.  go buy it now.  and listen.  and listen again...and then listen some more...
0385501560|4.0|Mr. Palaniuk does it again. The first 100 pages of this book are outstanding, but, like Survivor and Invisible Monsters, the rest of it doesn't live up to expectations. Definitely worth reading though.
014100018X|3.0|This was an enjoyable read, but I fail to see what all the fuss is about. Frankly, \\"Chocolat\\" just isn't written very well, and the clumsy verbiage is distracting and annoying. This book compares unfavorably to \\"Like Water for Chocolate,\\" which is much more elegantly written. Definitely overrated.
0553106635|5.0|I haven't written a review before, but this book is the most entertaining book in its genre that I have ever read.  While this statement also applies to the series as a whole, in my opinion this book is so far the most entertaining too read in the series.  So, why is this novel so good?  Well, there are a couple of factors at play here which raise this book to the pinnacle of fantasy literature.<br />First, it's real.  I know some reviewers have complained about this very fact and that it makes the book too depressing.  But, quite simply, when you read the book you feel like you are reading about REAL people with REAL motivations.  The atrocities, the barbaric attitudes of some characters are equally real.  This, more than any other fantasy series I have read, captures the spirit of the Middle Ages, a time period where such outrageous characters existed.  Yes, there are fantasy elements that put it outside the realm of real life (some magical elements, undead, etc.) but the characters always feel real--and this makes you want to keep reading about them.<br />This leads me to the second very entertaining aspect of the book.  Martin has made all of the characters interesting enough to follow, but at the same time the reader never knows which of these characters is going to truly succeed.  Much like the Middle Ages or even Dark Ages, there is no set hero, no set victorious character or faction in place.  This again reflects a time period where the tides swung in favor of those applying politcs and force in the most appropriate manner.  In otherwords, no character is safe in this series, just like you would expect in the Middle Ages, and a character you have followed and loved for several books might fall victim to the &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;.<br />I think these two factors are what makes this series stand out so successfully from the rest of the books in this genre.  I have read Jordan's series, Eddings, Tolkien, and many others.  While I have enjoyed them, I always felt like I was plodding along to an inevitable conclusion in that there was a hero, or group of heroes, that was destined to eventually succeed.  Such is not the case here--Martin takes more chances.  Of course, I would hate to compare Martin's writing style to Tolkien.  They are very different birds.  Tolkien's writing has a literary quality--you can actually sit back and marvel over some of the words he uses and the historical prose he creates.  It reads almost more like a fable, and if you enjoy reading more for the way the words interact on the page rather than the story, you will probably still prefer Tolkien's books.  However, while I appreciate and like Tolkien's work, I actually prefer reading a story that just flows from page to page, and Martin satisifies me on that score!  Definitely go out and start reading this series if you like this genre!
B0000026UL|4.0|Ol' Mr. Zimmerman's career had been lagging for sometime in both the critical establishment (but what do they know anyway?) and the buying public (ah, but they have the dollar, they have power as well).  The comeback album of the 1980s, coming at the end of what is generally regarded as the worst decade in Dylan's career. A little bit of history may be required to understand this album's critical reception: coming off the tails of such critically panned works as KNOCKED OUT LOADED and DOWN IN THE GROOVE (the later I own but do not know well and the KNOCKED OUT LOADED I haven't heard), and then the DYLAN AND THE DEAD album which umercifully kills seven Dylan songs with all of them sounding really stoned, many people had thought Dylan had come to the end of his rope. Not me though. That's because I've only been listening to him a year. =)<br />Anyway, much of the credit goes to Lanois of U2 fame. For once, Dylan's lyrics sound focused and forceful, singing wiht conviction about politics, Israel (with the Man in a Black coat being a rabbi), two relationship songs and one questioning the narrator's self-worth. The rest of the material stands out as well, proving Dylan's inspiration could still ring true. One thing I'd disagree with, which is the disc's sore thumb being &quot;Where Teardrops Fall&quot;, which I personally like.<br />My complaints are three. I personally think the placement of &quot;Disease of Conceit&quot; ruins the running order of this, with songs 7, 8, and 9 being, at least to me, being of the same type and something of a song cycle with the mood they create. It should have been placed before &quot;Most of the Time&quot;, which stands as one of Dylan's best &quot;painful&quot; songs. &quot;Shooting Star&quot; has a special place in my heart, it being the one Dylan song I knew back in the 1980s and 1990s, or at least was aware of it somehow. Vaguely. Anyway. I had a bootleg *cough* I mean a live mp3 *cough* I mean a song file I owned *cough*, well, lets just not say exactly what it was, but I've heard a live version of &quot;Every Thing is Broken&quot;, which I thought was a lot better than the album version.<br />My other two complaints come in the form of two songs. Dylan's greatest weakness is the form of album art, with this, BRINGING IT ALL BACK HOME, and INFIDELS especially, proving this adequeately. Listen to THE BOOTLEG SERIES VOL. 1-3. Most of that stuff should have been issued on the appropriate ablum, and both &quot;Dignity&quot; and &quot;Series of Drams&quot; should have been included on this. But as another reviewer said, if Dylan wasn't wilful and perverse he wouldn't be Dylan. Self Portrait stands as apt evidence for that phenomenon.<br />In the end, is it what its cracked up to be? Yes and no. Its a good release, but not his best. It certainly was the light at the end of the 1980s tunnel. Lanois and Dylan work well together, although this feels like a half-realized release when compared to their next collaboration, the masterpiece TIME OUT OF MIND. OH MERCY pales to that, but as its own its worth four stars.  Kind of like this was just something of a warmup to the real masterpiece that they still had in store.  Perhaps they'll make it a trilogy. Lets hope!  If the next release is like OH MERCY is too TIME OUT OF MIND, it will be his best album ever. <br />Just a little note: EMPIRE BURLESQUE is just as good as this is.  In fact, AMG rates EMPPIRE BURLESQUE 4 &amp; 1/2 stars while this only merits 3.  <br />Mike London
B000002H5I|5.0|&quot;For You&quot; is most poignantly beautiful and the ending intonation of the song; &quot;hm..mm..hm...hmmmmmmm..hm..hm..hm..for you&quot; is one of the sweetest and comforting musical utterances I've ever heard, it should have been repeated more than twice. Perhaps an entire track of just that utterance! Tracy's voice in this composition so humanly breaks but to a perfect and mellow tone. A musical expression of an honest and loving heart with a quiver and throb that transcends joy and sorrow,as true love does. Folksy but so elegant!

That is one or the more positive of the themes contained in this book, but in addition, the author was able to through a few subtle hints as to what she thinks of the general public&#8217;s mentality. Unfortunately, the latter was negatively derived, hinting that she believes that the average follower would take away the personal edge of life in order to substitute a simpler, more stable life. While I don&#8217;t believe enough unfeeling people would ever have enough say in order to overcome the task of &#8220;Sameness,&#8221; I follow her ideas in that it isn&#8217;t scrupulous. While this book caught itself in a few contradictions, it still has enough meaning in order to make one think.
B00005IBGQ|4.0|so buy his debut before ths cd, but i like poses after a few listens.  I presume that the repetition of the first track at the end of the cd is due to the fact that Rufus must be listened to multiple times and when you hear the chocolate milk song again, it begins to stick and percolate and age and get better.  And each time it gets better and better.  It's fun to see different versions of songs these days Like radiohead's Morningbell/amnesiac.  Rufus covers one of his father's songs on this cd and it works really well, almost too well.  It's a different lyric voice.  So spin this multiple times.  We;ve waited since, well, three years, that gap commercial during christmas 3 years ago?  The Cd doesn't blow my mind but it doesn't blow either.  ok bye

0812589041|5.0|Ender's Game is a wonderful work of science fiction.  I'll leave the overall synopsis to the thousand or so other reviewers who've come first and focus on a few main points.  <br />It's imperative that the universe in which a scifi novel takes place be well developed.  Card does a wonderful job of developing a world different and fascinating and yet so familiar.  It's not hard to imagine, given the threat of alien invasion and the challenges faced in Ender's universe, the governments of the world developing such a battle school and strike first mentality as Card envisions.  The tactics used to develop children into capable soldiers, while at first a shock to the senses, don't seem so much so as the novel progresses.  Of course we feel for Ender as he faces various challenges, some threatening his very survival, but we never question the validity or plausibility of those challenges.  That is the real beauty of this book.  Card creates a very believable world and populates it with characters we genuinely care about... and we do care about Ender.  <br />In Ender, Card creates a wonderful mix of intelligence, innocence and strength.  He's a child, not only tasked with saving the world, but doing so while struggling to retain not his innocence, but his very humanity.  What is more interesting than watching a child, the very symbol of innocence, try and remain human as the pressures of a world terrified of invasion, desperate for a savior, weigh in upon him?  Card's use of a child as the focal point in the timeless duty vs. personal morality struggle is simply wonderful.<br />A beacon of light in a world full of serialized Dungeons and Dragons novels and video games turned books trash

0671024256|5.0|This is the first Stephen King book I've ever read. I was tremendously moved by the personal history he tells and thought it took a lot of guts for him to write it.<br />But even more than that, it is a very down-to-earth guide to writing that is entertaining to read while offering very worthwhile advice. Like Bird by Bird, but more practical and concise.<br />Outstanding!
B00005J6UP|5.0|This film is without a doubt my favorite movie of all time. I am 27, and to date have watched this film no less that 75 times. It almost gives me a feel of nostalgia, feelings reminicsent of when I was a child. I think every child in one way or another has their own little &quot;Goonie&quot; adventures. Not a single person that I've ever asked dislikes this movie, it's simply wonderful. This one has been my personal favorite since the age of 12, it came out when I was 10. It's a movie that all parents should require their children to watch, to keep it going for some time to come. They need to make a second part, it's been 16 years since it's debut. Buy this film, you will not be disappointed, I promise you that.
B00005B4GU|3.0|If this was not Radiohead, (a) nobody would like it that much (b) nobody would even buy it. Radiohead seems so uncomfortable with their success and with their truly great music -- The Bends and OK Computer -- that they have veered off the deep end.  It's almost as if they've said to themselves: We're too popular, we're too good.  So they put out alienating elektronika like this.  I won't give it zero stars because, after all, it still is Radiohead but one more CD like this and I am seriously jumping off the bandwagon. Anybody who feels the same way, they can buy &quot;Lost Souls&quot; by Doves, a much better record. Or Badly Drawn Boy.  Portions of Amnesiac remind me of Pink Floyd at their worst. Sorry.
B000059Z8J|5.0|This is by far the best digital reproduction in my collection.  Accompanying the anamorphic video, the 5.1 audio track is perhaps better than the experience of the theaters of the late 70's when the film originally aired.  Hopefully, like Roger Bannister did for running in breaking the four minute mile barrier, others will shortly follow suit with similar excellent reproductions of more classics.  The &quot;bar&quot; has now been set...
B000002H2Z|4.0|It seems many of the reviewers here first heard this album in college--me too. This is a more accesible record than the experimental (yet fun) &quot;The Top&quot; and less gloomy than &quot;Pornography&quot; and &quot;Faith&quot;. &quot;Head&quot; makes a turning point in the band's evolution. It seems no accident that the &quot;Staring at the Sea&quot; collection came out the year after. &quot;Head&quot; is poppier without being vapid or irritating and still retains some of the band's trademark bluer, heavier emotional content. &quot;In Between Days&quot; still stands as my pick for the soundtrack of the movie of my life during those carefree undergrad years. Too bad the band didn't keep the momentum up with their next release &quot;Kiss Me&quot; x3. Too poppy, too &quot;up&quot;!
B00003CWL6|4.0|&quot;American Beauty&quot; brings a certain 'artistic' sensibility to mainstream film, but with more polish than one sees in many 'Art' films, to wonderful effect. The film scores points with me right off the bat for cinematography - aspiring filmmakers and photographers, buy this DVD.  Richly colored and majestic, the blend of fantasy and 'reality' in this film is seamless and used to great effect. The script is first rate,  showing us the brilliant resurrection and explosion of a lifeless American suburban family and the collateral effects on their neighbors. Kevin Spacey plays a middle-aged suburban husband who awakens one day and notices that he's completely alienated from his family, and that his life has lost whatever grace it might once have had. Taking this film a step beyond the &quot;mid life crisis&quot; cliche, his attempts to resurrect his own soul stirs the sleeping &quot;I&quot; in those around him. As with most heroic journeys, especially one in which the prize is so rich, there is a high price to be paid. More I will not say.  Capital-A Art is painful, and any film that can take what could be a 2-hour ad for &quot;Better Homes and Gardens&quot; and turns it into a beautifully painful, compelling and even surprising character study of Life imitating Art imitating life deserves high praise. The studio deserves credit for allowing this film to be released &quot;as is.&quot; See the film - it's worth buying.  Oh, the commentary track on the DVD is very good. There are a few omitted scenes which really add nothing much, and the rest - I didn't bother. The film's the thing, to paraphrase the Bard, and a great film it is.
B00003CXPD|4.0|The story of a young boy discovering he prefers to follow the  ballet lessons, rather than being forced to go to boxing, and the difficulties he encounters trying to convince his dad and brother it is not necessarily something for 'poofs'. I found the film very entertaining, the performances are wonderful, and it deals with the question of dealing with being gay (Billy's friend) in a very sweet and non-judgemental way. The only comment I have to make is that I thought the father's change of attitude (from being quite aggressive and forbidding Billy to pursue his ballet classes to totally understanding and supportive) in a rather short time slightly unbelievable. However, to include the struggle between him and Billy's teacher would probably not have made the film more interesting, since in the end the story is about Billy. I don't understand how you could not like this film.
078401213X|3.0|First, this film scores because it is a quality script with that does not even try for &quot;Hollywood&quot; style production.  Second, this film meets one of my personal criteria for a very good to great film in that it offers filmmakers / photographers good content to dig into, admire and learn from. Shot in black and white, the film has a certain 1960's-frenzied cheez-sci-fi style (maybe it was the weird, buzzing ambient score?) to it, but not to such a degree that it gets in the way. The cinematography actually reminded me of some segments from &quot;Fight Club&quot;, believe it or not. Other reviewers either liked or were turned off by the pseudo-math that supports the plot - one man's search for underlying order in a chaotic, apparently random universe. Simply put, one cannot tell if this search is a schizophrenic episode or the result of a man's mind trying to comprehend something it was not designed to. They missed the simple fact that this ambiguity drives the whole plot. Sean Gullette never gives us a clue as to whether he's a genius or an annoying axe-grinder convinced that JFK was assassinated by the Moonies / &quot;Blue Blockers&quot; are a government mind-control device / there is an underlying, absolute, predictable order to the universe. Okay, just #3, but still... Gullette's performance, especially in &quot;wing nut&quot; mode, is great. By the end, he's shaved his head and recollects the best of Robert DeNiro in &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; in his intensity, although his character is not required to jump off a personal cliff quite so high as DeNiro's. Like all great films, this one leaves audiences with more questions than answers. As an added benefit, the math, while simple, is presented in such a way that anyone could see what might compel a person to spend their lives studying abstract number theory. The only thing that keeps me from giving 4-5 stars is that this film is work to watch - it is NOT &quot;entertainment&quot; per se, and people shoppingfor &quot;entertainment&quot; tend to focus on &quot;# stars (x out of y)&quot; as criteria.  If that's you, forget it.  For the adventurous film fan, it's a worthy film.
6305878323|4.0|This is a wonderful film and Julie Andrews is luminous as usual.  I don't like the chimney sequence or the laughing sequence, but otherwise the film moves along nicely.  Dick van Dyke is annoying, but the children and other characters are fine.  The problem is with the DVD transfer: the picture's very blurry and skin tones are inaccurate.  This is the 2nd transfer Disney made of MP, and I don't see why they've the same mistake twice.  Anyhow, this movie is definitely worth having, and so the DVD is, unfortunately, as good as you'll get.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Arguably the best album of the 90s.  Easily one of the greatest of all time.  Radiohead wrote a concept album that truly conveyed their concept, of technological paranoia, the loss of identity in a world controlled by computers and monitored at all times.  And every song works perfectly.  The album is a true testament to musicianship, and should be owned by every true music lover.  Stand out songs include &quot;Exit Music (For a Film)&quot;, &quot;Let Down,&quot; and &quot;The Tourist.&quot;
0440219078|5.0|The Giver is a favorite of mine.  I know that it doesn't appeal to everyone.  I am not a Science Fiction reader.  This book is more than Science Fiction.  I am an elementary school teacher and have used this book in my classroom for years.  I have colleagues that frowned about the book because they think that is suggest certain things that children shouldn't think about.  A book can suggest whatever the reader wants to read into it.  I personally have found it to be a excellent book to open up discussions about important issues.  I try to read it around the time for black history month.  It is excellent to discuss how people different from ourselves are treated my us.  We discuss self-centeredness and how we want everything to be like us or our way.  Critical thinking is a wonderful skill to teach using this book.  Some have criticized the ending.  I love the open ending that is left for the reader to decide what happens.  Life is open for us to determine our ending based on the way that the issues in this book are addressed in our own lifes.  The book can be used as lightly or as deep as one would like.  Regardless it will leave you thinking.  This is one book that my students and parents talk about for years.
B00004W55E|5.0|I loved the c.d. I've been listening to it non-stop for the past 8 hours! The cut, &quot;I Can Explain,&quot; is simply incredible. Ferrells range and emotional chilling vocals makes my spine tingle. I still say that her duet with Will Downing a few years ago on the cut,&quot;Nothing Has Ever Felt this Good,&quot; still ranks at the top of my list as a personal favorite. &quot;Satisfied&quot; and &quot;Sista&quot; are dynamic as well. Keep singing Rachelle and soaring, swooping, swaying and swooning, simply because you do it perfectly!!!! Sing to me girl, as I listen to you hum the words, &quot;I made you cry...because you hurt me baby..No one has ever loved me like you do...hey....and WOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! Buy this CD and soar to the sky and swoop around the world. Ferrell will definitely take you there!!!!!!
B00005BL2A|5.0|The first time I listenend to &quot;Exciter&quot;, it just sort of sat there.  I didn't dislike it at all, but only two songs really jumped out at me (&quot;Dream On&quot; and &quot;I Feel Loved&quot;).  I've listened to it over and over again and now things seem to have &quot;gelled&quot;- it's a great album that showcases Depeche Mode growing as artists- which they demonstrate on all of their releases.  There aren't a lot of hit singles contained here, but that's really never been the point of a Depeche Mode album (&quot;Violator&quot; being the exception to that).  Dave's voice lessons have truly paid off- he sounds brilliant throughout &quot;Exciter&quot;.  The only thing that I cannot figure out is why they chose to leave off the song &quot;Don't Get There&quot;- it's one of the best things they've EVER recorded. (Martin does the vocals.)  Hopefully it will turn up as a b-side.  (It's not that hard to find on the internet.)
630522577X|5.0|What can I say?  This is not only a great story and a great musical.  Wide screen in DVD makes it about as good as you can get, other than seeing it done on the stage - which I have had the good fortune to do twice.  A must have for any collection.
B00005B4GU|3.0|This CD is definately not like Radiohead's first three CDs. OK Computer was one of the greatest CDs every recorded, and then they followed it up with the dissappointing KID A. Disappointing for me at least. I do have to commend the band on trying new sounds, but I still like the songs that include guitar instead of synthesizers. Amnesiac is much like KID A in the fact that there are few heavy songs with guitar, like OK Computer had. It is better than KID A, though because they use piano on many tracks which can be soothing, it's just too bad they couldn't have diversified the songs more. The best songs on the album are Pyramid Song, Knives Out, and I Might Be Wrong. It does have some pretty bad ones also, like the unlistenable Life in a Glass House. If you're looking for OK Computer material this isn't it; if you liked KID A you'll definately enjoy this one.
B0000004V2|5.0|I bought this magnificent album in 1990, and still today this is on of my best records. I`ll first heard about this incredibly group in 89`(I wanna be adored), so i`d &quot;selled my soul&quot; to Stone Roses. This is just a must-album to own for everyone who loves this kind of music.
B0000508U6|5.0|There's no need for parachutes with this album, because it absolutely soars. Chris Martin's vocals, slightly reminiscent of Thom Yorke's, has so much depth, from naive to scorned, that all of the songs lyrics of love and love lost ring true instead of coming of cliched or disingenuous. A really solid album that I've been enjoying for quite a while now. Sadly, with the band's growing pop success, I have an overwhelming suspicion that it's only a matter of time before you start hating them due to over-rotations on radio stations. But for now, definitely worth the price.
B000002N25|5.0|This solo album shows that as Knopfler ages, his music just gets better.  Golden Heart is still loaded with the cheeky, fun stuff for which MK is famous (Cannibals).  However, he also takes a stab at several other musical styles and lyrical themes.  Where else are you going to hear a pop song about what life was like as a soldier in Napoleon's Army??<br />The tunes and themes have a definite Cajun and French twist (Done with Bonaparte, Golden Heart, Je Suis Desole, Night in Summer Long Ago), but that's not all you'll get with this CD.  MK throws in a bit of his now classic &quot;country twist&quot; (Are We in Trouble Now), his standard slow and smoky musical tours (Rudiger, Vic and Ray, Nobody's Got the Gun) and a sweet love song tribute to his wife Kitty (Darling Pretty).<br />The musical quality of this album shines from the first run through the album.  The miracle of Knopfler music however is that the songs continue to grow on you each time you listen -- instead of getting tired of the tunes, you listen harder each time because you pick up some new wrinkle to his works every time you listen.<br />A highly recommended CD for any fan of adult rock and roll, guitar enthusiasts, former Dire Straits fans or folks who enjoy creative musical cross-over works.
B000059H99|5.0|I'm not after reviewing the picture nor the extras on this DVD, I just wanna tell you all what a great film this is! Sylvester Stallone wrote the script himself, and he wouldn't sell it unless he got to play the part of Rocky Balboa himeself. The movie is thouching, exciting, humerous and happy. Actors Talia Shire, Burgess Meredith and Burt Young makes this movie come to life, aswell as an excellent performance from Carl Weathers!<br />The film was shot in 28 days, and the budget came to 1.1 million dollars. Despite all of this, Rocky is, and will always be one of the best movies ever made!
B00005B4GU|5.0|Where Amnesiac truly succeeds is acting as a companion piece to Kid A while at the same time being so un-Kid A-like that everyone will like it.  This doesn't sound like The Bends 2 but it feels like it because unlike Kid A, these songs have great variety and there is no set mood. With Kid A, the whole was better than the sum of its parts, with Amnesiac it is the exact opposite.  You can look at each song (maybe not hunting bears) individually and marvel at the brilliance it achieves.  Again, I point to the variety of the songs on here.  Packt like sardines in a crushed tin box starts things out with an electronic pulsing beat and kettle drum yet is followed by the stunningly beatiful, piano-driven Pyramid song.  I might be wrong and knives out make you groove to guitar-riff driven rock while pulk/pull revolving doors and like spinning plates push the boundaries of noise music to more stunning levels than ever. You and whose army? and dollars and cents i feel are especially notable for their great atmosphere and singing. If you love karma police (who doesn't?) and wondered if radiohead would ever create anything as powerful as the end of that song then you will absolutely go nuts over you and whose army? And then to top it off the whole thing ends with the emotional life in a glass house. picture yourself in the 1930's in a dark, damp New Orleans lounge and you will truly see the beauty of this trumpet and horns driven song, the end is simply phenominal.  All in all this is yet another amazing album from Radiohead and it is just as exciting as ever to see what new musical directions they go in the future.
B00003CXAR|5.0|I have to admit, this movie scared the hell out of me when I was a little boy, and it still stands on the my list as one the scariest movies ever.<br />The chief of police(Brody) lives on the island of Amity, but he's still terrified of the water. He discovers that a great white shark is in the water, so he brings over marine biolegist(Hooper) to study the shark's victims. They then hire a man who is very well experienced with sharks(Quint) to catch/kill the shark.<br />The three men then sails out on a dangerous, but also very exciting adventure, and with Steven Spielbergs direction and John Williams' music, makes this movie into an all time classic!
B00005B4GU|5.0|At first listen, this album seems like the outtakes from Kid A. But the more I played this CD the more complex and gorgeous it became. It is not yet another musical reinvention by Radiohead, which stilled some of my hopes for the album. That said, this album sings, wails, groans, and murmurs its way to some dizzying beauty. So even though it can't claim to be another giant step in their evolution, we have to settle for the merely sublime. Lest this review settle into damning half-praise, let me say unqualifiedly, I love the sound, I love the feeling of this album. Tracks 2-5 are unbeatable alone and especially together. They have once again created an Album, a piece of music which asks to be heard not bit by bit, track (or song) by track, but in its entirety. I am more than happy to oblige, time and time again.
B00004XPOZ|5.0|This Star Wars special edition box-set is great! The special new effects look great(period), and the new scenes are very enjoyable. There's one thing though. Where are the DVD's? I know they're coming out soon now, but why did Lucas publish another VHS special edition box-set? Wasn't the first one enough? I guess, for die hard Star Wars fans this new box-set must be great, but there are many star wars fans out there who eagerly awaits the DVD's.<br />The reson I give this box-set 5 stars, is because the Star Wars movies are classics! DVD or no DVD, these movies are still great, even if they're on VHS. Afterall, the picture quality on these VHS tapes are superb, aswell as the sound!<br />Buy these VHS tapes, if not, wait for the DVD's!
B00003CXB4|5.0|This film is fantastic, far better than its sequel.  And yet where is it?  The sequel is available on DVD, but this is not.  And according to the Disney website they are not currently planning to release it either.<br />What can we do to get it released?  Answers on a postcard!
B000002OX7|3.0|This is a good album, but when you're discussing the great albums of all time I've got to leave this out.  The original nine tracks are all interesting, but by and large they don't make an impact on the memory.  (There are exceptions; more below.)  &quot;My Wife&quot; and &quot;The Song is Over&quot; and the others are decent songs, but they have no catch that ever makes one sit back and say &quot;Damn, that's a good tune.&quot;  The added six songs are exactly the same, except more so.  They're all good songs, but there's nothing to distinguish one from the other.  In fact, Pete Townsend and the boys made the right decision when these were left off the original release.  They're not bad songs, but there's no point or purpose to them.  Three tracks on the CD do stand out.  &quot;Baba O'Riley&quot; is an example of how diverse rock can be and still be excellent.  A vaguely Celtic flair from the fiddle makes it sound like no other great rock tune you've ever heard (at least I haven't).  &quot;Won't get Fooled Again&quot; almost falls into the trap I described above, but escapes it by being deliberately anthemic and through the brilliance of its lyrics.  Ultimately, &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot; is the masterpiece of this CD.  The repressed anger behind this song is truly compelling, and it remains fresh after several listens.  In fact, although some complaint has been uttered that the alternative recording at the end of the CD is unnecessary because it is so similar to the standard version, my feeling is that having &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot; come up on the play list twice during one hearing will never be a bad thing.  My last thought on this CD is that Townsend got a bit too full of himself after the success of &quot;Tommy&quot; and got pretentious with his whole &quot;Lifehouse&quot; project.  The peak(s) is/are remarkable, but the CD has no direction, . . . which may explain why Lifehouse was never finished.
068485743X|5.0|THE FIRST FIVE PAGES is one of the best books on writing I've ever read. <br />Don't be swayed by the review from the &quot;Northwest&quot;, which is not only wrong, but factually incorrect. He says the &quot;whole first two thirds of the book are devoted to pointers like don't have misspellings or draw on your manuscript,&quot; which is completely untrue. Those two topics are never even raised in the book.<br />He claims the book has &quot;no specifics and finer distinctions about what distinguishes good writing from poor&quot; - but this is exactly what the entire book is devoted to. In fact, there is an entire chapter devoted just to &quot;Subtlety&quot; and another chapter devoted to a subtle topic, &quot;Tone.&quot;  <br />This guy sounds like a spurned writer to me.  The First Five Pages is one of the best books on writing there is.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Are you a Radiohead?  If so do not buy this album... you won't get it. Contining where Kid A left off this album is a remarkable masterpiece.<br />Radiohead have done it and as with Kid A this is not music as the rest of the world knows it, it is the sound of the present and the future as one.  Challenging and diverse, lush and sweeping but most of all masterfully complete.  Remove one phrase and there would be diminishment. <br />If you love music listen to this until you understand.... If you do not then I suggest you turn on the radio. :-) dxx
B00004SCX6|3.0|This album really surprised me.  I thought it was going to totally suck but there are some good memorable songs on it. The two I'm talking about are Don't let me be the last to know and Stronger.  These 2 tracks make this album somewhat worthwhile.  The other songs truly sound like each other and Britney really needs to come up with new material on her next album.  Otherwise you can say bye bye bye to this pop princess.
B00005B4GU|4.0|This is not a more &quot;accessible&quot; record, as the rock critics would have had you believe before it came out; it is NOT a return to OK Computer's hushed, yet melodic songs. This is clearly an outgrowth of Kid A (which makes sense, as the tracks were all recorded at the same time).<br />If you're looking for something to rock out to, to play in the car on the way to the beach, get yourself the new Weezer or something along those lines. However, if you want something that is at times beautiful and graceful, at other times overly difficult, then this record is for you. It's more suited to playing in a rented hatchback on your way home from Montreal in the middle of a night in the pouring rain than at a party, for instance.<br />Their are some beautiful songs; check out &quot;The Pyramid Song&quot; and also the first track &quot;Packt like sardines in a crusht tin box&quot;. It's a great album opener, and sets the feel appropriately. This is an album to respect and admire, if not love and play for all your friends. Despite its great aspects, there are signs that Thom Yorke is trying too hard to make a statement about &quot;Art for Art's sake&quot; and anti-commercialism. It's wonderful that he lets the creative energies flow, but there are a few tracks that seem deliberately obtuse; the oddness seems more of a contrived device than a necessary method tho get out what Mr. Yorke is feeling.<br />I guess it all comes down to a simple question: what is the purpose of music? Is it merely to entertain, or to get ideas across, or let the musician let out his emotions? I think the really great albums do all three (although I put higher emphasis on the &quot;entertain&quot; part) and I'm not so sure that as a whole this one does, which keeps it from greatness. I think the boys from Radiohead have forgotten how to keep their audience entertained. It's not selling out to write a catchy song that people like. Radiohead have constructed a powerful, and (along with Kid A) unique album. For that they have my respect and admiration. However, they're no longer the go-to-guys when I want to slap on a great CD and be assured of a great song.
0792153294|4.0|At first glance, this movie might just seem like another sci-fi movie about the destruction of the Earth. But really, this movie goes a lot deeper. The emotions expressed in this movie are teriffic, and the plot line is great. I admit it, this is one of those love-it-or-hate-it movies, but I loved it!<br />The main plot of the story is that a comet,known as the Wolf-Beiterman, is discovered to be on a track for contact with Earth. After the US Administration keeps it a secret for a year, it is revealed that safety measures must be taken. A spacecraft Messiah is sent up to stop the comet. <br />This movie goes a lot deeper then the astronomical/catastrophical  cover. It is a story of self-sacrifice, family, and true love. Almost every character sacrificed someone to this, whether it be a child, a parent, or themselves. Families were broken up when parents gave up their children so that they could be safe. True love was a large part of this movie, between families and between couples. A very touching story, the first sci-fi movie that I have seen that jerked tears, Deep Impact is not to be missed!
B00005B4GU|4.0|I'm still very much making up my mind how I feel about &quot;Amnesiac&quot;... it's an album which has got me a little on edge!<br />&quot;Kid A&quot; was undoubtedly one of the finest albums I bought last year, a collection of mellow and atmospheric music which redrew the musical landscape. The follow-up, made up of songs recorded at the same time, seems to me to straddle the gap between the more guitar-driven - but still progressive - &quot;OK Computer&quot; in 1997, and the more dissolved, undefinable sound of &quot;Kid A&quot;.<br />Is &quot;Amnesiac&quot; therefore a retrograde step? Well, no - but it did catch me by surprise. Amongst the more traditional tracks (the singles Pyramid Song and Knives Out, as well as You and Whose Army?, have considerably more structure and lyrical meaning that many of the songs from &quot;Kid A&quot;), the band have thrown in some edgy electronica which makes far less comfortable listening: I'm talking particularly about the tracks Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors and Like Spinning Plates. It's because of these that I can't feel the same sense of relaxation and understanding that I did with &quot;Kid A&quot;.<br />On the plus side, Pyramid Song is one of the most beautiful pieces of music I have heard since the last Radiohead album!<br />Musically, Radiohead are continuing to push the envelope, blending samples, guitars, and even the jazz trumpet with Thom Yorke's heavenly vocals. This album proves that they remain in the league of progressive, interesting and just darn TOP rock bands today. Perhaps it will grow on me further, in which case I'll have to revise my current rating of 4 stars - it's reflecting the one or two tracks I can't quite bring myself to truly adore with the rest!
B000002LOE|5.0|This album just overflows with quality songs like Radio Song, Shiny Happy People and Losing My Religion. Other highlights are Half A World Away, Texarkana and Near Wild Heaven. The melodies, lyrics and harmonising are just perfect, making up an album of superior melodic rock songs. Rock doesn't come better than this. A classic!
B00005B36H|4.0|With albums like Aenima and Undertow, I didn't think tool was going to be able to make it back.  But to my suprise Maynard and the boys are back and have something to say.  The guitar playing seems to have become a more powerful and intense part of the song.  Maynard's voice and lyrics though in my opinion still make the whole song.  All I can say is it's worth the buy if you liked any of the past albums you'll love Lateralus.
B00004KD11|5.0|People need to quit trying to compare this album to Machine Head and later Deep Purple.  This is vintage, progressive rock ahead of it's time for 1968.  Compare it to other rock dics in '68, and it clearly is a classic.  The first time I played it in '68, I could not believe the excellent organ work, progressive drums, and distinctive guitar work of Richie Blackmore.  Sit back, crank this up, turn down the lights, and the sounds will take you away.  It's easy to see how this was a precurser for Rod Evans classic participation with Captain Beyond in 1972.  Folks, this is a classic and a stellar way for Deep Purple to launch their historic career.  Quit comparing and just enjoy the disc!!
B0000062GE|5.0|I love &quot;Darkest Days&quot; so much I'm still listening to it even though I bought it three years ago.  I heard &quot;Save Yourself&quot; on the radio and after I heard it I immediately bought the CD.  I first thought they were just a rock band with an industrial sound, buy was I surprised.  From the opening title track to the last song (&quot;Waking Up Beside You&quot;), I was in awe.  These guys are better than Nine Inch Nails (SW keeps getting compared to them and it's unfair) because unlike NIN, they give a sense of hope in their songs to coincide with the depressing lyrics, something NIN doesn't do.  Stabbing Westward are one of the most underrated bands of all time, but personally, I hope they stay out of the mainstream, it would ruin them.  All in all, &quot;Darkest Days&quot; is one of the best albums ever made, and Stabbing Westward is one of the best bands of all time.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Radiohead has done it again.  With O.K. Computer, radiohead let us into a world that was overgrown with horrible diseases only the human mind could create.  Later, with the advent of Kid A, the band introduced us to the mutation of the spreading human virus.  Now, with the newly released Amnesiac album, Thom Yorke and crew have plummeted to the depths of hell and scorned the race of humanoid paranoids with the test of an undeniable, but often ignored truth.<br />The inherent message of Amnesiac is the end of all things as we know them... ...created by man and self-collapsing, the world will cease to exist.  With all of these wonders we have confabulated in our weak little lying minds, now we must face the truth, and the truth is something that can not be denied, but is obviously ignored.<br />Take a listen a few times through this album, and see all those things that haunt this band, and haunt the deepest catacombs of your psyche.
B000002HRE|3.0|&quot;ReLoad&quot; starts off with a bang (Fuel), and ends with another bang (Fixxxer), but what's between is a mixed bag.  The standout tracks are Fuel, Memory Remains, Unforgiven II, Carpe Diem Baby, Low Man's Lyric, and Fixxxer, but everything else sounds like filler material.  It's not that bad, but it's not that good (just like &quot;Load&quot;), and I hope Metallica goes back to their thrash roots on their new album like Megadeth just did with &quot;World Needs a Hero&quot;.
0060926317|1.0|I would discourage anyone from reading this book, unless of course your intention is to contrast with say, \\"Footprints Across our Land.\\" Mutant Message Down Under is a fictious blending of cultures and in no way reflects actual australian native cultures or traditions. Some of the author's inconsistancies were so blatent that I decided to do some further research and encountered a review at ... which detailed at length why and how this book is in no way a work of journalistic merit.
B000002H97|5.0|Yes the songs are shorter.  Yes the riffs aren't as structured as past Metallica songs.  Yes their thrash sound is gone.  Yet the Black Album is one of Metallica's best.  The riffs aren't as fast paced or in your face thrash, but every song is very melodic, and it does want to make you bang your head.  The Black Album is great, but it doesn't quite make up for future releases &quot;Load&quot; and &quot;ReLoad&quot; (&quot;Garage Inc.&quot; more than makes up for them).  The Black Album is a master work, and no Metallica collection is complete without it.
B000002UAU|5.0|This was an awesome CD!  Every song was a hit!  This is a must have for Beatle fans everywhere! So in honor of John Lennon,  buy this CD.  Cheers!
B000002H6C|5.0|While many Metallica fans call this Metallica's \\"concept album\\", and others say this is where Metallica began to \\"sell out\\", I see it differently.  Yes the production [is questionable], but thats what makes this good.  The [questionable] production makes the entire album sound raw (like on Kill 'Em All), and I couldn't imagine the songs on this album to sound any differently.  \\"One\\", \\"To Live is to Die\\", and the title track are true epics, while \\"Harvester of Sorrow\\" and \\"Dyers Eve\\" just plain old rock with Metallica's trademark 80's thrash sound.  This may be where Metallica began to enter the mainstream, but it is an excellent album, and every Metallica fan should have it.
B00005BL2A|3.0|I've been a Depeche Mode fan for a long time, and since 97 I've been anticipating their return,not sure if they were going to top 97's ULTRA. They didn't.There are some really great tracks on this album...&quot;Dream On&quot;;&quot;Shine&quot;;&quot;I Am You&quot; and &quot;Goodnight Lovers&quot; are the best ones for me. Some tracks are &quot;hard&quot; to listen to in my opinion.. &quot;The Sweetest Condition&quot; and &quot;The Dead of Night&quot; seem to be..at first..auckward, after a while there not so bad. I expected smoother songs sung by Martin..they seem goofy..not powerful like past songs. If your a fan and can take a weird change from these guys go ahead and buy this album..I like it more every time I play it...I'm just glad they didn't give up!
B000002H33|5.0|&quot;Master of Puppets&quot; is Metallica's second best album (only &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; is superior), and my god, no one makes metal music like this anymore.  James Hetfield's rhythm section is unbelieveably fast and Kirk Hammett's solos are electrifying.  Lars Ulrich's drum smashing keeps a steady beat throughout all the craziness on the album, and Cliff Burton (the God of bass) truly is the greatest bassist of all time, and he proves it here.  Every song is memorable, not one filler song can be found on here.  &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; and &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; are definitive thrash albums that every metalhead should have, and if you don't, get 'em.
B00005ARDC|5.0|It's a sad comment on the current state of affairs of rock and roll to realize that a band like Black Rebel Motorcycle Club will probably never rise above cult status and that their brilliant debut &quot;B.R.M.C.&quot; will never get the attention it so richly deserves.  It's also sad that the band will forever be compared to, and slagged off for sounding like, The Jesus &amp; Mary Chain, Primal Scream, Spacemen 3, and other britpop predecessors.  While it's true that traces of all of these groups, mixed together with dollops of The Stooges and The Beach Boys, are all present in the fuzzy, dreamy brew that is at the core of BRMC's sound, they somehow manage to make it sound exciting, dangerous, and yes new again.  The one-two punch of &quot;Whatever Happened To My Rock 'N' Roll (punk song)&quot; and &quot;Awake&quot; are as potent as anything yet released in this relatively musically barren year.  &quot;B.R.M.C.&quot; is a cinch to make it on my best of 2001 list.  A band that stands tall and sings into the light...
B000002HMH|3.0|The argument continues.  Did Metallica sell out or did they just evolve?  In my view, Metallica still rocks, but they're newer material can't hold a candle to classics like &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot;, &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, or &quot;...And Justice For All&quot;.  But the one highpoint of &quot;Load&quot;, and it is a BIG highpoint, is the song &quot;The Outlaw Torn&quot;, which in my opinion is one of the best Metallica songs ever written, but if it's one thing I can say, they still have their edge, but it's been really trimmed.
6303823351|5.0|I think all four of those weirdos did a terrifc job with the movie even though they're not actors! In this movie you can tell John is really funny! George shows that he is not shy and serious but he's just as wacky as the others. Somebody said the producers should cut out all of Ringo's parts but if they did there would be no movie! Help is focused on Ringo's sacrficial ring he's wearing!
B00002Z88D|4.0|I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little leary when I heard Metallica was recording with a symphony, but I was pleasently surprised, mostly.  The versions of Call of Ktulu, Master of Puppets, Fuel, Bleeding Me, Nothing Else Matters, Until It Sleeps, For Whom the Bell Tolls, Outlaw Torn, One, and Battery are pretty good, but why in the hell is Devil's Dance on here???  It was the worst filler song on ReLoad (next to Better Than You), and it doesn't sound any better live.  The two new songs, No Leaf Clover and Minus Human, are pretty good, and the symphony does add a sort of new dimension to Metallica's music, but compared to Metallica's box set, Live Sh*t, S&amp;M can't hold a candle.  But if you don't allready own the box set, or if your a Metallica freak, you gotta get this.
0671024256|5.0|Wow! I could not put this book down until I have turned the last page and I still do walk with it.  This book is now one of my &quot;bibles&quot; on the art and craft of writing.  Stephen not only talks about his own writing and how he goes about it, he advises the beginning writer to &quot;write every day no matter what.&quot;  His account of the writing craft is both funny, sarcastic, witty and downright truthful.  When I read the story of the author who was found sprawled out on his desk in despair because although he wrote only seven words, he did not know in which order they should go, I realized more than ever that I am not the first and certainly won't be the last of writer's who despair over their words.  One of the other things Stephen mentioned is the undying love and respect he has for Tabiita which is by far a true plus. Thank you Stephen for handing me my very own secret weapon to writing. Bravo!
B0000020C4|5.0|This is the best Les Mis recording to buy.  The cast is responsible for this:  <br />Colm Wilkinson plays a solid Jean Valjean.  The only thing I found annoying was his characteristic &quot;squeak&quot; at the end of some of his notes.  Is this a usual occurance?  Philip Quast is AMAZING as Javert.  He looks the part, and sounds the part.  &quot;Javert's Suicide&quot; is rich with despair and sadness; the really sharp note at the end is a despairing scream, yet it is nailed perfectly.  I loved Ruthie Henshaw.  Her version of &quot;I Dreamed a Dream&quot; is tearjerking, and, of course, it helps that she has a golden voice.  I have heard that Athony Warlow should have been Enjolras, because he would have been much better, and that he could not come. I think that Michael Magwire, though he doesn't have quite the vocal power, is still very good.  Besides, if you see the video, reader, he looks SOOO Enjolras-ish.  I think it is in the eyes.  I swear they flash blue anger at every glance.  Michael Ball is the usual star-struck Marius.  However, his version of &quot;Empty Chairs&quot; is very nice.  This man seems to be good at emoting, and he does not lay off the habit in this particular number.  Lea Salonga is a good Eponine.  (How an Asian was ever born to Alun Armstrong and Jenny Galloway, who, by the way, are also wonderful, I do not know.)  If Fantine's voice is golden, Eponine's is silver.  Judy Kuhn is not bad, especially for a soprano.  <br />When reading the reviews of the cast below, I didn't see much acclaim going to a certain singer.  Adam Searles!  What a Gavroche!  His voice is just gorgeous.  (Pity it has probably changed by now.)  He has the playfulness, yet idealistic seriousness of Hugo's rebel sprite.  I could listen to him all day.<br />Buy this CD!  It is spectacular!
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Get yourself into your cineplex at once to see this film.  It's going to loose some of its larger than life sweep when it goes to the smaller screen.  This is a towering work of the imagination which is matched by powerhouse performances.  I saw this with my friend Joyce and we both were equally enthralled from start to finish.  Joyce is not an artist but had no trouble following the abstractions in continuity Baz Luhrmann achieved with his fast edged cutting, blurring pace and sequencing.  As a director and writer, he is an expert at film collage. This is how a musical should be made in 2001.  The biggest problem the old movie musicals had were leaden pacing and the jarring sense of a song artificially intruding into a play. That is all gone here just like it was gone in Milos Forman's &quot;Hair&quot; and &quot;Amadeus&quot; and Bob Fossee's &quot;Cabaret.&quot;  What  formidable problems these modern masters have solved in the movie musical genre.  Ewan McGregor I could go on about for pages.  Neither Joyce nor I realized that he could sing.  Saying he can sing is like saying DiMaggio could hit a baseball or Monroe could play a sex goddess. He is that good a singer.  In fact, had he taken to the rock concert stage, he probably would be an even bigger star than he is right now.  Fortunately for us film fanatics, he is also a first class actor and chose to follow that call.  If he'd been around in the 1940s and 1950s, he would have had the lead in every major musical of the day.  I don't know if he can dance but I wouldn't be surprised if he can after this tour de force performance.  To top it all off, he's got great on screen charisma.  The camera loves him as it does just a few actors.  He's even got dark hair here and it totally works for him. Nicole Kidman also does a first class job.  She does a very good singing job but is not in McGregor's stellar singing class.  She also does a powerful acting job and looks wonderful in the part of Satine the courtesan. The rest of the cast is also very strong and you can tell they are all veterans of moving around stages and sets.  Jim Broadbent, playing the impressario, is superb even outside a British PBS production, his more usual venue, continuing on a theatrical riff like he did for Woody Allen in &quot;Bullets Over Broadway.&quot; The plot is operatic. McGregor is Christian in 1899 Paris, a penniless writer.  He falls in love with Satine, a dancer and courtesan at the Moulin Rouge theater.  She suffers from consumption (TB), which her stage family tries to keep secret.  A duke also wants to make her his mistress in order to back a new musical with her in the lead.  Christian presents an obstacle to the duke's plans, however.  Rather than this story's being leadenly told, however, you are audio and visually shown each facet to it.  When the film deals with jealousy, it is in a powerful performance piece that starts out with the tango performed on the stage by two other performers and moves outward from there involving other cast members. Modern music is used throughout, most of it rock music.  Luhrmann got it to work beautifully.  I've seen all three of his films and I prefer them in reverse order, his newest to his oldest.  Thus, this is my favorite.  &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; with DiCaprio and Danes is a strong second place but did not bowl me over to the extent this film did.  It showed the potential for &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; though.  &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; was very good but I would have never dreamed we were moving from there to this.  It's like moving from drawing with charcoal on a pad of paper to painting on huge canvases in oil. This is my choice of 2001's films for best picture Oscar so far and everyone in it is a strong contender for each of their categories as well. Knockout sets, costumes, cinematography, scoring and everything else inbetween to boot.  I just hope it doesn't lose out in the awards to another action-adventure mega blockbuster as we saw happen with the 2000 films.ppen with the 2000 films.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I love this cd because it has a lot of upbeat songs.  My favorite tracks are: &quot;Oops!... I Did It Again, Stronger, Lucky, and Can't Make You Love Me.&quot;  &quot;Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know&quot; and &quot;Where Are You Now&quot; are very beautiful.  I think Britney did a great job on this album.  Her voice has matured a lot since her last release(which was also good, but it wasn't as strong and powerful.)  I thoroughly enjoy listening to this cd a lot, and I would recommend it(if you like Britney Spears.)
0800121260|5.0|Hero is really a gem.  It features consistently good performances and is sharp, thought-provoking, and is touching without approaching sappiness.  You get Geena Davis while she was still making good movies, Dustin Hoffman without much visible ego, a solid Andy Garcia, and the always-fabulous Joan Cusack.  <br />This movie was SO underrated.  I remember reading that Quentin Tarantino said this was a movie he wished he'd had a chance to direct because it could have been so much better, that in this movie you see a director reaching the extent of his abilities, and while I was glad to see that someone was recognizing it in any way, it also really made me mad that Quentin Tarantino, not like the most consistent or productive director, should say that about Steven Frears, who directed My Beautiful Laundrette, Dangerous Liaisons, and this.  Really!  This is for me up there among the best movies of the past 10 years, certainly among the most underappreciated.
0385421982|1.0|I never really got taken in by this story.  It took 2/3 of the book to really get down to what the pelican brief was.  Then the last 1/3 was like watching a car chase. The ending was fluffy,  I was expecting an exciting twist that might make the whole book worth reading, but didn't get one.  Left disappointed.
B00004TL21|3.0|Its loud and brash and soft and sweet t the same time. Tool fans would like this. But wassup with the lyrics? Anyway i like it.
B00004U8H4|5.0|This is a great movie that few people like. You have to understand that it is a satire on a particular point in time in our nations history. It's based on the controversial novel by Bret Easton Ellis, which is FAR more graffic. The main character, Patrick Bateman, is an ideal character because is able to get away with things that anyone would be arrested and locked up for. PLEASE watch the movie all the way through before passing judgement, because you realize what Patrick has been doing the whole time. It's a magnificent twist about the conscious and sub-conscious, along with what's real and in someone's head. Also includes an allstar cast with: Christian Bale ( Swing Kids, Empire of the Sun, Newsies ), Willem DaFoe ( The Last Temptation of Christ, PLatoon, Shadow of the Vampire ) and Reese Witherspoon ( Fear, Election, Cruel Intentions ). Either you love this movie or you hate it, and I have to go with the seemingly small crowd that loves it. Also if you love the movie, check out the book because it's sure to blow you away.
B00004XOWM|1.0|I'm gonna make this short and sweet...Limp bizkit's new album is nothing special. It's just the same ol'sounds. Their music(new album)is boring and it makes no sense. They have lost what being a band is all about. Now it's all about the money and less about the orginiality. Buying this cd is a huge waste of money. I'm so glad I didn't spend my money on something soo worthless and just plain ol'stupid.
B000056VIY|3.0|This is an OK album.  Jen's vocals improved, slightly stronger now compared to the rather feeble ones  I hear in &quot;On the 6.&quot;  I am still waiting for the day when she does not need a heavy chorus to back her in the songs.  With much practice, she has the potential to be a genuine singer.<br />The songs mmm...I like the Latin infested feel of &quot;Ain't It Funny&quot;.  Brings out the best of her voice.  The rest are just ordinary mainstream R&amp;B songs. Nothing special. You have heard &quot;Love Don't Cost A Thing&quot; and &quot;Play&quot;.  So, tell me the difference between these two songs and Destiny's Child's &quot;Survivor&quot;? Nil. <br />Production wise, alright - she has got the best producers and writers to enhance the album.  Put it this way, too MANY cooks spoil the broth especially when you have mediocre ingredient.  Get it?<br />Unless you absolutely have no other CD to buy, give J.Lo a try. P/S - Nice pictures, though.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|My friend told me he'd heard the soundtrack was just a bunch of covers of sappy old love songs.<br />It's so much MORE than that! It's an amazing assortment of lyrics, taken from songs of all genres and eras put together in an ingenious conglomoration, making for a soundtrack that crosses all kinds of musical boundaries. Ewan McGregor (Christian) and Nicole Kidman (Satine) sing their characters' songs, and they have incredible hidden talent that would never have been discovered, had it not been for producer/director Baz Luhrman's perfectionistic vision. The nightclub, however hand-me-down in name, leaves room for an anything goes attitude, influenced and encouraged by the Bohemian themes of the movie's plot and characters. All around, it's a wonderful display of talent on both sides of the mic.
B000000WG4|4.0|Yes, I have to agree with other reviewers that Mike is a master musician, playing nearly all instruments. Truly talented indeed.<br />He brings into the new age genre a special blend of music - matching various musical instruments in a fashion not done before. There is no limit as to how Mike can concoct new sounds, all the time and beautifully.
0800141601|2.0|This is such a poor representation of the myth of Camelot that its hard to believe that the same man responsible for Forrest Gump did this. Richard Gere is much like Kevin Costner, in that he has to employ a very poor English accent for his part. I could care less. Neither actor pulled that off, but I never felt that was important to the films. Costner's Robin Hood is a good escapist, fun film, whereas First Knight is boring, tedious and uninspired. If a viewer wants to enjoy a truly great film on Camelot, he/she should watch Excalibur. It is far better in every way, except one. Connery is a great King Arthur. Its too bad  he couldnt have had the inspired talent surrounding him necessary to make such a great tale into a likewise great movie.
0064471837|5.0|Oh my god this is the best book. It has everything you need in a good sci-fi fantasy novel. It takes action, adventure, romance, and magic, rolls it up and creates a world anyone can relate to. I was so happy to here he made a sequal to Sabriel. I can't wait to get it.
0060934913|4.0|I was in the restaurant biz, as a waitress/bartender for several years.  I also married a sous chef and lived with a line cook and was and still am friends with several folks in the biz.  I soo relate to this book.  I found myself laughing out loud to myself numerous times.  It really made me miss my years in the business..as hard as they were.  Everyone should have to put time in working at a restaurant.  People think restaurnat workers are the scum of the earth.  But as the author conveys, they are some of the hardest working, fun people I have ever known.  The business is full of hard drinkers, druggies, etc., but they are some of the hardest working honest folk you could know.  If you have never put in time working in a restaurant..don't bother reading this book...you just won't get it!  KUDOS, CHEF!
0393307050|5.0|The only thing I didn't like about these books is some of the people who also liked them. George Will--Mr. Unctious Right Winger--do you believe that that so-called baseball expert ever owned a bat, ball or glove when he was a kid.<br />Then I saw that Bob Livingstone--disgraced speaker-elect of multiple extra-marital affairs. Livingstone to his mistress: &quot;Well have to go and pilory Clinton my dear.&quot;<br />I suppose I can see the the appeal of these books to right wing reactionaies. After all, they do take part 200 years ago. Will did say he liked the ordered universe of naval society, where everyone knew his place and duty.<br />And they like the Tory politics--even though Aubrey was quite apolitical and saw politics purely as a way to get political interest. (They forget that Aubrey's father is a Radical.)<br />They might also like that Maturin turned his back on the French. <br />What they miss is that Maturin still supports independence for both Catalonia and Ireland. His attitude towards the French is one of bitter disappointment, both at Napoleon for betraying the ideals of the Revolution and becoming an autocrat; and at the Revolution itself for its excesses<br />Someday someone ought to write a nuanced historical novel from the French point of view--if such does not already exist.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|&quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;, as well as the film itself, is an amazing musical journey through modern and classical songs &amp; music.  With a unique and often peculiar outlook on cover songs, this album -- despite its often genius musical composition -- is not for everyone.<br />&quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;, Baz Luhrmann's third adventure into the filming and musical world, is no doubt a soundtrack that invigorates and intensifies one's mind and dance. There is only one original song in the entire film, &quot;Come What May&quot;, an amazing duet between Kidman and McGregor that is not only extremely heart-felt, but overwhelmingly beautiful and amazingly orchestrated. <br />&quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;, the single released (and overplayed) is quite contagious in its dance atmosphere while &quot;Your Song&quot; and &quot;El Tango de Roxanne&quot; remain highlights that show the surprising talent of Ewan McGregor's amazing voice.  &quot;Elephant Medley&quot; is also an amazingly unique and intriguing track, mixing a variety of popular love songs (even &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;) into a large ensemble between Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor.<br />I recommend this title for those who enjoy unique and exhilerating music -- but for those with strongly open minds.  The music is different and does not compare as a whole to the extremely poppy &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;.
6301066642|4.0|A plot that has Johnny Ray playing a priest torn between his vows and his bows--and it only gets worse from there.  But some of the production numbers are deliciously extravagant even by Hollywood standards.  The &quot;Alexander's Ragtime Band&quot; montage--a musical workout that incorporates a variety of musical styles and ethnic costumery and dance--is easily worth the price of admission all by itself.  It alone testifies to Berlin's importance to American music and consequently to the universe.  (But as a fan of Marilyn Monroe, I must say her performance is not indispensable viewing.)  For a more aesthetically satisfying tribute to Irvin Berlin, check out the movie entitled &quot;Alexander's Ragtime Band,&quot; starring Tyrone Power and Alice Faye--or, for that matter, &quot;Top Hat&quot; with Fred and Ginger.
B000001ESN|5.0|For several albums, beginning with Caress of Steel, Rush dwelled in the style of writing sci-fi epics, and in doing so garnered them a devoted underground following. Then came Permanent Waves, which signaled the beginning of two eras for the band: the first album of the 80's, and the beginning of a new approach to song writing. Perhaps deciding that the epic style had grown old and run it's course, Rush altered it's songs to the rock mainstream and made them more radio friendly. All the while they never went back on their roots or forgot their musical prowess. The result is a musical masterpiece and undeniably one of Rush's best efforts. With this album also came perhaps the greatest trilogy of rock albums ever, along with Moving Pictures and Signals.<br />Starting off is two bonafide radio classics in Spirit of Radio and Freewill. Both get substantial airtime and give a hint of what was to come in future releases. Next is Jacob's Ladder, an overlooked gem and one of my favorite Rush songs. Mostly an instrumental, the song really works thanks to some eerie vocals and great synth work by Geddy. Entre Nous follows, and it's another Rush track that is underappreciated and has some great lyrics. Following that is Different Strings, probably the weakest song of the album, which still makes it great. Closing out the album is one of Rush's greatest songs in Natural Science. Written in three parts and clocking in under ten minutes, the song is years ahead of it's time, and it has some of the group's tightest harmonies, not to mention a background of waves which highlight it nicely.<br />No matter who you are, if you release an album with only six tracks, you better make them count. Rush accomplished this, proving time and time again that quality is better than quantity. That said, this is a welcome addition to any Rush fan's catalogue, as well as a great start to one.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I actually wanted to give this album a 4.5 but since I can't, I rounded up.<br />Radiohead, Radiohead...where to start with these guys?  Well this is the album that brought in all the hoopla, and I must say it really is justified.  Not too sound trite or pretentious, but what many other reviewers have been saying is very true...this is NOT an album that you will like you first few times listening to.  This is an album that you have to sit down, concentrate on, and read the lyrics to fully appreciate.  Its very similar to a difficult math equation or a difficult computer programming code that needs to be deciphered (I'm sure Radiohead love that second comparison...).  At first, it is very difficult to comprehend or &quot;tackle&quot; but once you understand it--once you &quot;solve it&quot;, so to speak--it is very rewarding.  This album is very conceptual in that it is an album warning of the perils of modernization and the &quot;digital revolution&quot;, yet ironically, it seems that this is music for the 2000 and on.  It seems that certain lead guitar parts are reminiscent of alarms and bells and things that remind you of computers--hence the name &quot;OK&quot; Computer.  The thing that I really like about this album is its melodicism.  It's very layered and subtle...it sounds like the sounds are almost leaking or oozing into your brain, rather than most music when you can decipher the individual chords, chorus, melodies, etc.  I think thats what makes this album special, it seems like one big song--but in a good way.  Personal standouts are &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien&quot;, that song is just incredible to listen to (the sounds, etc.)--very detailed.  &quot;Climbing Up the Walls&quot;, &quot;Lucky&quot; and &quot;The Tourist&quot; are awesome, as well.  The reason this album doesn't get five stars because of 2 reasons: 1)for an album to get five stars it has to be absolutely flawless--VERY few albums are five star albums, in my book.  This album has one major flaw (see reason #2).  2) At times it seems as if the band is trying to be just a liiiitle too self-important, or artsy fartsy.  For example, Thom Yorke's complete rant against capitalism is a little ignorant...capitalism has its many flaws (just like any other system)--but let's not exaggerate, here...the world isn't coming to an end, is it? (hopefully not... :-) )  However, that is really the only bone I have to pick with this album.  All in all, this is a really landmark album that really defines the 21st century and what it's all about.  Highly recommended if you like music to be more than just &quot;background music&quot;.  Also, check out Ben Harper and Outkast...great stuff as well, in my opinion.
6305897786|1.0|Okay, from the start I am going to be quite honest.  I LOVE Johnny Depp and would readily watch anything he does.  Roman Polanski is always interesting, at least, and with such stalwart credits as &quot;Rosemary's Baby&quot; and &quot;Chinatown&quot;, I figured, &quot;how bad could it be?&quot;  Trust me....THAT bad.  The plot was simple and interesting enough to command my attention but the storytelling could not at all keep it.  I fell asleep and missed the ending and from what I understand, that did not hamper the whole film experience.  Johnny Depp was gorgeous and adept and Frank Langella was sinister enough.  I agree with another reviewer in that the picture set a mood and always remained on the fringes of being a thought-provoking piece of work, but, alas, fell horribly short.  Of course, you must be true to your own opinions and tastes. It is worth a viewing for no other reason than it has a reputable cast and director, and is a mood piece but the bottom line is this is one to use on those nights you can't fall asleep and you don't want to use drugs of any sort.  This will definitely do the trick!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00003CXRM|2.0|I really tried to like O Brother, Where Art Thou? I really did. I am a big fan of the Coen bros. style, but unfortunately, this film was a disappointment if there ever was one. The story is original, but is destroyed by stupid cameos and unfunny one-liners. The film is also very offensive at times. Every character seems to have a look of mental disability on his face. This is not funny, it's downright stupid and has no meaning. All the other Coen bros. films have meanings for their characters to have funny looks or funny faces but O Brother, Where Art Thou? does not explain anything whatsoever. And there's a scene where a cow gets run over by a car whilst the boys are being shot at. This is totally a totally gut-wrenching scene, all the audience - about 12 people where in the theatre - looked away from the screen, no laughs going on. I guess the Coen bros. think they can get away with anything now, after all their success. Tim Blake Nelson is the only really impressive performer. George Clooney can sing really well, but him acting in a Coen bros. film is a bit beyond the pale. So, what's good? Well, the cinematography is lush and the musical scenes raise a nice smile, but overall, O Brother, Where Art Thou? is one overrated and utterly disappointing film.
B00003CXRP|5.0|When I went to see this movie in the theater I was expecting &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; and I was disappointed.  I think I got that idea from the TV commercials.  It wasn't until the end of the movie that I realized I had missed the point.  So many people miss the point of this movie.  Even those who end up liking it don't get it.  I'll give you a hint.  It's called Cast Away not because Hanks' character is marooned on an island but because he is cast away by his fiancee.  When you realize that you can fully appreciate the movie.  I'm glad to see that at least one other person knows the truth (See: Extraordinary by Dr. Christopher Coleman).  Once you know this truth then the whole movie opens up to you.  The four year marooning is an interlude that trys to distract you from the real meat of the movie.  It tries to put you in Noland's shoes and get you to think about surviving.  Soon you forget about Helen Hunt's character.  Then when Noland returns you realize that he has been gone for four years.  She thought he was dead.  Now that she has moved on what does it mean for the two of them?  That is the moment in the movie to which everything else is made to support.
B00003CXE6|4.0|A great plot with somewhat of a sad ending this movie deserves 4 stars no more, no less. If your into adventure,gore,drama and history this is the perfect movie for you, but for others I recomend renting it.
0792151712|5.0|The first-rating story and breath-taking magnificence of Titanic from 1997 is unsurpassabled by any other fascinating film. The real-life catastrophe , which happened in 1912, is combined with an fictional love story. The handsome star Leonardo Di Caprio and the Oscar nominated Kate Winslet are the young lovers Jack and Rose in the film, who meet at first passage on the unsinkable Titanic. The passionated love becomes a seizing race against time and death when the luxury ship hits an iceberg in the glacial sea. The price-winning producer James Cameron stages a brilliantly film about forbidden love and courage in a beginning disaster with a just so fitting soundtrack and a remarkable technical department. This master-piece with romantic and dramatic elements and a lot of action and humor everyone should have seen.
B000002P5W|5.0|The Jimi Hendrix Experience followed up their magical debut with another masterpiece.  Axis: Bold As Love is a psychedelic gem that opens with the bizarre, feedback explosion of &quot;EXP&quot;.  &quot;Spanish Castle Magic&quot; is a great song with some superb guitar while &quot;Wait Until Tomorrow&quot; has an almost pop sound with a catchy as hell chorus.  Mr. Hendrix's music has always had a socially conscious bent, but &quot;If 6 Was 9&quot; is one of his most overt social statements, with its spacey sound and its pro hippie lyrics.  &quot;You Got Me Floatin'&quot; has a propulsive beat, &quot;Castle Made Of Sand&quot; has a quiet sound with some very poignant lyrics and &quot;She's So Fine&quot; has Mr. Redding's debut as a lead singer.  &quot;Little Wing&quot; is a stunning song of power and majesty that has been covered by other guitar greats like Eric Clapton and Stevie Ray Vaughan.
B000059MEK|5.0|At a first glimpse of this cd, I thought it was good, but not the best.  After listening to the simplicity of each track, I started to realize, this is what made the cd great and unique.  Normally, I am into the very complex beats of techno and d&amp;b and scorn any music created without the heavy duty equipment and gear; but such music, though very up-tempo, doesn't quite move me emotionally as some of the tracks do here, and make me want to listen to them more and more to the point that I become eager for the end of the day to hear it one more time.  The downfall is that the songs may loop inside your head over and over 'til it either drives you insane or you can't concentrate on anything else because you are so hooked.  Also, if you are in a techno! techno! only techno! phase, this may not be your cup of tea.    With an open mind and willingness for some corny yet addictive synthesized disco style beat, this may become your favourite cd.
B000002UVX|5.0|Jimi Hendrix played a New Year's Eve show at the Fillmore East in New York without the Experience but a new band he dubbed Band of Gypsies.  With Billy Cox on bass and Buddy Miles on drums, Mr. Hendrix's sound moved away from the psychedelic rock he was famous for to a darker, bluesier sound that was infused with r&amp;b.  The sound was definitely a forerunner for funk music.  &quot;Machine Gun&quot; is a wicked track that has a deep and dense sound.  &quot;Power To Love&quot; is a r&amp;b flavored track while the album's closer &quot;We Gotta Live Together&quot; is an ode to a harmonious existence.  The music from Band Of Gypsies is a departure from what he was known for and a progression in his musical styling.  Unfortunately, he was never able to really expand on these sounds as less than a year later, Jimi Hendrix would lose his life to asphyxiation due to a drug overdose.
B00004WG4G|5.0|Everything that people say about this film is true.  It is a sad but lovable classic. Detailing small-town suburbia in a quaint but kewl cast makes this movie realistic. It's no wonder why people are arguing over trivial items. This picture is worth the amount of money to get.
B00005B4GU|2.0|This sounds like bad outtakes from Kid A. There are a couple of good songs, but this is the band's worst album. A trite little disc from a band that is getting full of itself. Kid A was also overrated, sounding like a Joy Division album with updated sounds for the new century. One of the songs was such a blatant rip-off that it was almost as good as Joy Division. I'm not into gimmicks and muzak, so I guess I'll just have to keep listening to The Bends.
B00005B4GU|5.0|A member of Radiohead commented that he thought OK Computer was one song too long and that 3/4 of an hour of Radiohead is enough for any listener.  If Amnesiac was any longer it would be even more difficult.
B000002LLC|5.0|It's a shame Warner Brothers released &quot;Vogue&quot; on &quot;I'm Breathless&quot;. Though &quot;Vogue&quot; is a masterpiece dance song, it doesn't belong here.<br />When the album was released, I expected to be dazzled by the modern dance tracks I thought it would have had. I was very disappointed. We were deceived by the higher ups.<br />I always make a point of listening to new albums before I pass my final judgement. I'm glad I did. It truly is her most overlooked CD. If anyone else would have released an album like this, it probably would have damaged their career. This album has some of her best vocals and music as well. She's a natural with this one. It made me a appreciate a wider variety of music. Another similar type album is Sinead O'Conner's &quot;Am I Not Your Girl&quot;. , which I probably wouldn't have bought if it weren't for Madonna.<br />This album, I believe, made Madonna successfully try new things with her music and shows that Madonna is the master of her own career.<br />If you're looking for something different than anything else she has ever done, &quot;I'm Breathless&quot; is for you.
B00005BJC7|5.0|I've read reviews that say this album has several throw-aways like, &quot;hunting bears&quot;,&quot;packt like sardines...&quot; and &quot;pulk/pull...&quot; But imagine this is thirty years ago (or so) and this is a band called Pink Floyd or The Beatles. I'm positive those tracks would've been stamped &quot;revolutionary&quot; and &quot;visionary&quot; or &quot;what music will be some day&quot;, who knows?  And for all the naysayers and bitter critics, i say loosen up, stop listening with your hands over your ears. Your not hearing what will probably be considered one of the best albums ever created.  Your not listening with an open mind that is in tune with the history and with the possible future of ground-breaking music.<br />This is their finest album to me. I find it to surpass any work they have up to date. Buy the cd and try to stay calm. They're not trying to offend your ears, but open them up to the possible future of music.
6304539258|5.0|A classic tale of good vs evil that revolutionized the movie industry.  From start to finish Star Wars provides edge-of-the-seat action combined with a great story and quality acting.  This film will appeal to all ages, all you have to do is sit back and enjoy.
B00005ASGG|5.0|First the movie itself needs no discussion.  Its simply one of the best westerns ever made.  It deals with morality in the old west and gives no easy answers.  John Wayne gives one of the best performances of his career and even people that don't like Wayne will like him in this film.<br />The DVD has a beautiful transfer from Paramount.  The image has very few defects and the picture is very rich.  The restored mono soundtrack is excellent, but the new DD 5.1 track is really no big deal.  There are no extras on the disc, but a film this great really needs none.
0385335482|5.0|This novel is hilarious and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  As someone who suffers from a Becky Bloomwood-esque shopping problem, it didn't help me spend less, but I've spent so much time reading the book over and over again that I can't spend so much time shopping.  Buy it today!
014028009X|5.0|This book is hilarious and I recommend it to everyone.  It is v. different from movie, in manner of Girl, Interrupted or similar--in that it is better.
630451087X|4.0|LOST HIGHWAY is perhaps the most bizarre film David Lynch has ever directed, and that alone says quite a bit (considering that this is the man who gave us ERASERHEAD). But don't get me wrong. I'm all for films that makes you ponder and wonder about what it was all really about. So why only four stars? Well, first off, perhaps the film does deserve more. It might be more fair to give it a 4.5 instead of an even four. But I simply don't feel that this film matches up to David Lynch's other projects, such as WILD AT HEART and the excellent BLUE VELVET, and this may be the reason why I'm judging this film a bit harsher then what might be justified.<br />Because LOST HIGHWAY does get your attention (and it deserves it). I've got to give it that much. And if you have a taste for strange erotical and psychological thrillers with a surreal theme to them (did I just make myself sound like a psychopath?), then it's a fair to good chance that you'll enjoy this film. But it seems to me that David Lynch simply tries too hard in being \\"different\\" and weird. It's as if he doesn't want you to understand what's going on. As a viewer you'll only get the absolute minimum of information required to solve the enigma. The dialogues, for instance, resembles typical European art films where the characters only say one line to each other every ten minutes or so (ok, it's not that bad, but close). And a lot of elements in the film that seems to be of crucial importance, are just plain weird. And this will quickly seem pretentious and, dare I say, elitist.<br />Of course, everybody who has seen this film, has their own theory on what the film is about. Here's mine... Bill Pullman stars as Fred Madison. He's a mediocre musician who finds himself in a sort of existential crisis when he discovers that his wife, who's portrayed by Patricia Arquette, has been deceiving him (she's been starring in porn flicks). In a crime of passion, Fred kills his wife and is thus sentenced to death. On death row,Fred Madison decides for himself that this is not the way he wanted his life to end, so he \\"dreams up\\" (or rather \\"escapes into\\") a fictional fantasy world that he creates. A crucial line of dialogue in the film is when Fred Madison (when asked by a police officer why he doesn't like video cameras) declares: &quot;I like to remember things my own way. Not necessarily the way they happened&quot; So he turns himself into the handsome, young mechanist, Pete Dayton. But even in this fantasy world, Fred Madison can't keep the disappointments of his real life out, and things begin to move towards their end. And I guess that's about as much as I can say without spoiling the surprises. So as I see it, LOST HIGHWAY is a film about escapism. And this does seem to be a favourable theme for David Lynch. ERASERHEAD appears to be about the same thing (finding an escape from your everyday rotten existence).<br />The music in this film must be mentioned. It's great! David Lynch is widely known for being fanatical about mixing the sound for his films, and it clearly shows that the score is the result of a perfectionist. You could compare it to 2001 - A SPACE ODYSSEY. The musical score (albeit hugely different in mood and tone) possesses the same unparalleled quality. David Bowie contributes with the song I'M DERANGED (taken from his album OUTSIDE) which is used to create a dreamy feeling right at the opening (when we see the headlights of a car driving along a lonely stretch of road at the dead of night (David Lynch appears to have a fetish for roads and cars...)) Both the German industrial band Rammstein and goth-rocker Marilyn Manson (look for a cameo appearance by Marilyn Manson and Twiggy Ramirez in the film) made their fortunes on this film. Trent Reznor (who produced the score) and Nine Inch Nails are also here. And Lou Reed contributes with the amazingly cool song, THIS MAGIC MOMENT. Of course, Angelo Badalamenti is also present to provide his smooth sounding jazz songs. It's truly magnificent!
B00005B4GU|2.0|Kid A part two. I was hoping for something that could actually be called a &quot;song&quot; on this record, but an Englishman mumbling over backwards music is not a song. It is experimentation and is best left in the studio.<br />Radiohead is certainly isolating themselves. Kid A sold far fewer compies than OK Computer, and I'm sure Amnesiac will sell even less. I have been a long-time Radiohead fan, but I am seriously considering not even buying their next album, at least until I've heard it first.<br />The greatest bands in history have managed to stretch themselves and experiment, but have done so within the realm of listenable music that appealed to more than just an eclectic group of esoteric die-hards. I am a professional musician, so on the one hand I can understand what Radiohead is doing, but on the other hand I don't appreciate it at all. They are capable of putting that same energy and uniqueness into beautiful music (with melodies, unlike their last two albums), so it is frustrating to hear them wasting their talent on Kid A and Amnesiac. In fact I've wondered if maybe the songwriting well is drying up and that's why they're just putting this garbage out, under the guise of &quot;art&quot;.<br />I had heard this album was significantly different than Kid A. It is not. I'm not sure what the title means, but amnesia would have been a good idea, with respect to Kid A. Get on with making real music again!

Young Frankie's father suffers from 'the drink,' while his mother suffers from depression and often neglects her children.  They are malnourished and live in squalid conditions.  Too proud to accept charity, Frankie's father drinks away what little money he manages to earn.  <br />Reading allows the young boy to escape to other worlds.  Through books, Frank develops his survival skills and a sense of hope for a better future.  This strengthens his determination to earn enough money to return to America one day.  McCourt's ability to illustrate the humor in his tragic childhood is very inspirational, albeit bittersweet.<br />This book should be required reading for all teenagers.

078401213X|5.0|Some information is simply not safe for us--not because there is something wrong with its  possession in the abstract, but because it is the sort of thing we humans are not well suited to cope  with. There are various things we simply ought not not to know. If we did not have to live our  lives amidst a fog of uncertainty about a whole range of matters that are actually of fundamental  interest and importance to us, it would no longer be a human mode of existence that we would live.  Instead we would become a being of another sort, perhaps angelic, perhaps machine-like, but  certainly not human.  -Nicholas Rescher, an essay entitled Forbidden Knowledge<br />In his excellent book, Forbidden Knowledge (see Orrin's review), Roger Shattuck discussed the  persistence and continued relevance of one of the central themes of Western Civilization : the idea that  certain kinds of knowledge have been placed, quite specifically and intentionally, beyond our reach  because we do not have the capacity, at this time, to handle them, or to wield them responsibly.  I've  no idea if Darren Aronofsky had read Shattuck's book before making this movie, nor whether  Professor Shattuck has ever commented upon the film, but it perfectly illustrates the point.<br />In Aronofsky's film, a brilliant young mathematician, Max Cohen (Sean Gullette), believes in several  precepts :<br />  (1) that mathematics is the language of the universe  (2) nature can be expressed in numbers, and  (3) there are patterns everywhere in nature.<br />Most importantly, he believes that we should be able to perceive and interpret the patterns, to  comprehend the language, and that he is on the verge of doing so.  Yet, while patterns seem to emerge  at every turn, from a swirl of cream in a coffee cup to a seashell at Coney Island, the meanings of  these patterns remain maddeningly elusive.<br />Meanwhile, both a vicious Wall Street henchwoman and a Hassidic Jew approach Max about his  work, the first thinking he's about to figure out the hidden patterns in the Market, the latter thinking  he can decipher the numerical code hidden in the Torah.  Max however has hit an impasse, including  crashing his computer, and turns to his mentor for help.  Like Max, he too was once a brilliant, cocky  young mathematician, but he's had a stroke and now just sits in his apartment playing the game of Go.<br />And just in case all that isn't enough, Max has paralyzing headaches brought on by an incident from  his youth, an incident which evokes Daedalus :<br />  9:22. Personal note: When I was a little kid my mother told me not to stare into the sun. So one  day when I was six, I did ... the next day I had my first headache.<br />Whether physical or mental in nature, Max's headaches are soon accompanied by nosebleeds,  hallucinations, and a mounting sense of paranoia, as his grip on reality begins to slip away.<br />Aronofsky achieves some sense of the disjointed and terrifying world that Max is living in by setting  the film in a decaying tenement in Brooklyn, shooting in Black and White, manipulating the film to  make it incredibly grainy, actually mounting a camera on Sean Gullette (the actor playing Max) so  that on tracking shots we're moving with him but looking right in his face, etc.  Some of these  techniques work better than others, but all serve to give the film such an unusual look that it is very  much its own distinctive world.<br />But most of all there are the ideas.  Max's hubris--his belief that the universe's secrets are lurking just  beyond his line of sight or his chain of thought, and even more important, that he in particular has  been given the capacity to finally perceive them and that when they are revealed he will be able to  handle them--is shared by so many of the great heroes of our culture, from Adam and Eve to Dr.  Frankenstein, to Faust, and so on.  (Like Faust he even makes a deal with the Wall Streeters in order  to get a new, extraordinarily powerful processor for his computer.)  The message of the film, as in all  of its predecessors, that no matter the quality of the individual--no matter the genius, or the purity, or  the ambition--Man is simply not ready to share in these secrets, is so profoundly antithetical to our  Age of Reason that it is a pleasant shock to find an artist who's still resorting to it.  And, amazingly  enough, this mythical lesson is still just as powerful today as it has been throughout human history.<br />You can't really discuss the end of the film without ruining it for first time viewers.  Suffice it to say  that the denouement is both shocking and inevitable.  This is a movie that not everyone will  like--mostly due to the unusual look of the film, Max's sometimes off-putting behavior, and some  genuinely disturbing images--but if you stick with it and at least accept the visual style, you'll be  treated to a compelling version of one of our oldest, but still most relevant, stories.<br />GRADE : A+get a new, extraordinarily powerful processor for his computer.)

B000002UAU|2.0|Why so many people keep saying this album is so great ?? Its nothing more than the great Beatles playing around with studio techniques and, consequently, losing all their spontaneous creativity. The sound is very bad, RIngo Starrs drums are worse instead of better !!! Most of the songs try so hard to be great that they are boring most of the times ...I prefer even the album &quot;HELP&quot; or &quot; ABBEY ROAD&quot;. I admit that the album opened up possibilities for rock.
B000002ADT|5.0|Along with STEAMIN' and 'ROUND ABOUT MIDNIGHT, KIND OF BLUE, makes the argument that Miles Davis was the most influential Jazz men of the 20th century.  <br />KIND OF BLUE is the best of the three and, to my ears, one of the 2 or 3 best Jazz albums ever recorded.  &quot;So What&quot; is perfection, slipping and sliding through subtle changes and flashing a band like nobody has ever heard before or since.<br />A truly amazing record.  Absolutely classic.
B00002DESX|4.0|Released in 1976, this was the breathtaking debut by RAMONES. The album has fourteen songs compressed in only 29 minutes, using some of the silliest and dumbest achords ever played in a guitar. But the result was grandious, fantastic. You can sense the nergy flowing around, giving you pleasure every second. A true classic for the rest of mankind..
B000002ULO|4.0|An oddly moody album, coming from the man everyone loves to chide for his inate good humor, FLAMING PIE finds McCartney in a contemplative mood, looking back and a bit worried about the future.<br />There are more colors and tones here than on any Macca LP since LONDON TOWN, and La Big Mac hits on most cylinders. &quot;Somedays,&quot; &quot;Young Boy,&quot; &quot;Beaufiful Night&quot; are wonderful tracks, and there's plenty of fine stuff here.<br />&quot;Calico Sky&quot; and &quot;Little Willow&quot; are my favorite 'soft' McCartney tracks in a long, long time.  I've heard he wrote &quot;Calico Sky&quot; for Linda, but it makes me wish Macca would do a kids LP, nothing but the sweet lullabyes he does so well.<br />FLAMING PIE doesn't quite meet the standards of MCCARTNEY or BAND ON THE RUN, but it stands with VENUS &amp; MARS, SPEED OF SOUND, TUG OF WAR and others as a 2nd-Tier McCartney record, which is to say it's top flight.
B000002KB8|5.0|This album is much better than PARANOID, for example. This is a punch in the stomach, the definitive beginning of &quot;heavy metal&quot;, the first clear use of power chords and riffs together. Ozzy is singing like never, the production is good for seventies standards. I imagine hearing it when it was originally released, what a shock it must have been. All the tunes are great, Iommi solos are some of the best of his entire career, the lyrics are perfect. What more do you want?
0440219078|5.0|My name is Eric and I'm in the 8th grade.  We just completed reading The Giver.  I found the story very interesting.  Though it was confusing at times, as an active reader (with the help of my teacher)I was able to understand some things that were very confusing.  Lois Lowry did an exelent job on symbolism.  I also like the way that she kept you optomistic.  Though you could predict what was going to happen, there would always be a turn in the story that was totally un expected.  I urge you to buy this book and read it for yourself.  This is one book that blows away all of the others!
B00005LC1H|5.0|I am a huge &quot;Honeymooners&quot; fan.  Love &quot;The Andy Griffith Show,&quot; &quot;I Love Lucy,&quot; &quot;The Odd Couple,&quot; and &quot;Columbo.&quot;  Yet, I still believe Fawlty Towers was the best thing ever done on television.  Too bad there were only 12 episodes completed.  I must have seen each episode several dozen times and I still cant's stop laughing each time I see Basil do his goosestep and Hitler imitation, Basil whacking his dead car with a nearby tree branch, Manuel panicking when he is told that the chef put basil (the herb, not his pet rat) in the ratatouie (pardon the spelling), Sybil's absurdly comic laugh and &quot;I know, I know,&quot; and Basil's put down of a nurse &quot;Don't touch me! I don't know where you've been!&quot; and &quot;My God, you're ugly, aren't you!&quot;  <br />Even if you are (were) not a fan of the Monty Python series (I was), you will love &quot;Fawlty Towers.&quot;  Even if you have seen these episodes many times on PBS or on the BBC America channel, you will want to own this series so you can watch it again and again. Even if you have this series on tape, as I do, you will want to own it on DVD.  I just hope the transfer is done well.  Unfortunately, there have been too many bad transfers done on DVD (a reminder of the old laser disc days).  A recent reminder are the classice Basil Rathbone as &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; series.  I love the &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; movies with Rathbone and Nigel Bruce.  However, the DVD of this series was an abomination.  Let us pray that this same situation does not befall my beloved &quot;Fawlty Towers.&quot;<br />&quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; is a must for anyone who, every now and then, just needs a great laugh.  Enjoy it!

Neo is hooked up to an umbilical cord, that has to be broken if he's to be freed from the matrix. Then he proceeds to destroy the &quot;mother&quot; who nourished him.

0525945636|1.0|A couple days ago, I finished reading Ken Follett's latest suspense thriller, &quot;Code To Zero&quot;, and couldn't wait to finish it!  Just to get it over with.  I didn't think it was filled with suspense, I thought it was predictable; it wasn't a thriller, it was a bore and the characters and their dialogue were corny. The premise is promising. A man who is suffering from amnesia has to discover who and what he and his mission are.  And why government agents are &quot;out to get him.&quot;   As I read this book, I kept thinking that I was reading from an elementary school reader.  Mr. Follett insists on explaining each element of the thin plot and should give his readers more credit than that.  I think most readers know what's going to happen in the story before the writer does! Very disappointing!
0385501560|2.0|I never believed that writing could be too dark and depressing, too close to the truth.  For me there is something brutally honest about writing that confronts societal issues with insincere carelessness.  &quot;Choke&quot;, Mr. Palahniuk's latest foray into the realm of modern day nihilism, however, has quickly changed my mind, proving that you can have too much of a good thing (even if it's bad for you).  Though as flamboyantly entertaining as &quot;Fight Club&quot; was (both the novel and the spritefully dark film version by David Fincher), all too often does the writing reflect that of Mr. Palahniuk's first novel.  The obsession now is not with fist-to-fist contact but with that...other form of physical contact, sex; his characters still seek refuge in churches as members of support groups; the sudden, climactic twist has not been dropped; and yes, his main character is as disillusioned and emotionless as the narrator of &quot;Fight Club&quot;.  What at first was an interesting and unique peek into the mechanics of society becomes just more tabloid, shock-value randomness that I fear Mr. Palanhiuk (a.k.a. Bret Easton DeLillo) will not be able to veer away from.  The most emjoyable moments are perhaps those that will be considered by some to be the most ridiculous: those concerning Victor Mancini's supposed connection/resemblance with Jesus Christ.  It almost reminded me of &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot;, except overstuffed with negativity.  Is there a single, shining ray of hope in the novel's last chapter?  Perhaps.  I would say yes, but even so, that one ray isn't enough to alleviate the dark, pregnant storm cloud that is &quot;Choke&quot;.

B00005BJ2O|5.0|I have never seen a better movie than Moulin Rouge. I love Broadway and this movie brought that back for me. I love the soundtrack for Moulin Rouge and the actors and actresses are amazing. I feel almost like I know Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, like I can see into them. Their singing brought a passion to me. Their songs were breathtaking and beautiful and their voices gave me spine-tingling feelings when I watched them.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|&quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is one of the most breathtaking motion pictures I've ever seen.  Easily the best film of 2001.

6304813759|5.0|A winning, inspired comedy that is refreshingly unique in itself. Robert Carlyle heads the cast in a film centering on the lives of a group of unemployed men in Sheffield who decide to become a strip act. There are fine moments of high comedy throughout. The superb performance compliments the razor sharp script that also bubbles with inventive repartee. The film is accompanied by an enthralling soundtrack that builds up the atmosphere for this fun comedy. Despite its gritty undertone this does surprisingly emerge as a feel-good film. The scene when the men are pumping and gyrating to the songs on the radio whilst waiting in the dole queue is unforgetable and inspired comedy. An excellent classic!
1572522089|4.0|I'm not very familiar with &quot;King Lear&quot;, much less Shakespeare but Akira Kurosawa did a magnificant, if not brilliant take on a Shakespeare classic. Despite my lack of knowledge behind &quot;King Lear&quot; I was deeply moved by the main theme of this movie which was loyalty. Even blood relatives could turn on each other. Based on what little I know of Kurosawa, he was big on the theme of loyalty and the importance of it. The scenery in the opening of the movie was stunning. The battle scenes were brutal yet at the same time the viewer cannot help but be in awe of the director's ability to capture the reality of war. Simply stunning to say the very least. I think the slight problems I had with this movie was that some of the scenes tended to lingered on and seemed repetitive, particularly the scenes with the father who had gone mad from the trauma of death and rejection. Fitting for someone who banished his youngest son for speaking the truth I suppose. The young companion whose sole purpose in the movie was as a court jester kind of got on my nerves too but he was young and impetuous. Asides from those flaws, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Definitely a classic epic brought to you by the late and great Akira Kurosawa.
6304297912|5.0|Irvine Welsh's startling novel is bought to life for the silver screen and it does the compelling, best-selling book total justice. Director, Danny Boyle shows imagination and inventiveness with this origanal, provocative story of four Edinburgh lads going on a self destructive rampage and focuses harshly on the characters physical decline into heroin addiction and the harrowing situation that revolves around this. Some scenes are admitedly disturbing but thats solely down to its superb performances from the cast which features Ewan Mcgregor, Robert Carlyle, Ewen Bremner, Johnny Lee Miller and Kevin Mckidd. They all put in powerful, very commendable performances and compliment the razor sharp scripts that are totally astounding and eerily realistic. Despite its deeply unpleasant content the film welcomingly has its fair shair of laughs although is pure black comedy. This well balanced film evokes the harrowing atmosphere and some hard hitting facts brilliantly resulting in a stunningly unique piece of work that is nothing sort of a masterpiece. Highly recommended!

B00005B36H|3.0|I had heard so much about this album and I generally don't buy anything I hear a lot about because it ends up being all hype. I really loved Maynard's voice on &quot;A Perfect Circle&quot; so I thought I would check this out. This album is not an easy first listen...nor second, nor third...it takes about a week of careful listening for you to start picking out nuances that are integral to the music.  I was pretty impressed at first but soon things started to wear thin. It sounds like the drummer is doing a continual solo and not focusing on keeping the beat, the guitarist is in Drop D tuning the whole album and though he plays some good rhythms, there is nothing groundbreaking here. A lot of his riffs sound very similar to the stuff Tom Morello does on the first Rage album. Riffs around the 3rd and 5th frets with that open D ringing out way too much (sue me because I'm a guitar player). The bass player is good and has a nice thick tone on this album. The tracks &quot;Mantra&quot; and &quot;Faaip de oaid&quot; are a waste of disk space..the songs are much too long for the attention span of the listener...blah blah, yakety smakety. Two things make this a decent listen, the strange rhythms that the band puts out and Maynard's incredible voice that goes from a scream to a melody in the course of a few seconds. This album is not as good as all the critics say it is, but if you're a Tool fan you should probably get it, as it's not bad if you can get past the predictable guitar riffs and the 8 minute songs that start out quiet and shift to loud after about 4 minutes...
B000050XEI|5.0|Enya music keeps an even keel when it is needed.  This album is very relaxing and melodic.  Great for those times when you feel out of sorts and need to kick back.  Close you eyes and let your imagination flow with the songs.
B00000FCBC|3.0|This CD is clearly made for the metallica junkie that loves hard metal.  The 1st CD shows more variety in playing style (metal, rock, 'hard country' and a few other styles), but the 2nd CD is almost strictly just hard metal.

B00005B36H|5.0|Clearly their best album, Lateralus once again shows why Tool is, and may always be, one of the best heavy bands in the world. This album must seriously be considered Album of the Year and is essential for anyone interested in Heavy Metal- Hard Rock. This album is as good, or even better than Black Sabbath's- Sabotage or on a different scale Metallica's- Ride the Lightining. Even the jewel case it comes in deserves praise. A masterpiece.

It would make a great \\"falling asleep album\\", or maybe a great album to clean the house to, but to listen to \\"Trouble in Shrangri-la\\" while driving on a long trip fahgetaboutit! It put me to sleep! I generally only like Stevie's hit songs, and on this album I can't recall a single song that stands on it's own. But if I had to pick some songs I grooved to, they would be \\"planets of the universe\\",  and my 2 favourites \\"bombay saphires\\" and 2 Far From Texas\\". *Final note: My friend and I were trying to figure out if Stevie was writing about the booze \\"bombay saphires\\" Hey Stevie, if you are, cheers you're my kind of girl.

There is no Polyanna tied to the tracks in this movie.  No Duddly Doright.  Just Dick Dasterdly with an attitutude. This is a movie about the guilt that a town shares over the death of their marshall. The town creates the marshall's avenger and they are blown away (literally) by the depths of their anguish. Nothing like this had ever been done before.  An unbelievable jaw-dropping experience.  This movie should have won an academy award.

Aronofsky's earlier film, PI, was similarly clever is its execution and hollow at its core. This movie is just a relentless barrage of shock tactics masquerading as a meaningful cautionary tale. Ugh.

B00003CXBK|5.0|I loved this film. I saw it having seen little or no anime before, and was most impressed. The visuals are absolutely stunning at times and the characters expressively drawn. Not only that, but it has a well-crafted story which bravely avoids the trap of a cliched 'Hollywood' ending where the 'bad guys' get beaten and the 'good guys' kiss and live happily ever after. The characters and factions in the story are much less black and white than pretty much all animation (and live action for that matter) that I've seen. All 'sides' in the central conflict of nature versus technology have legitimate motivations, and all of them also have something to learn. The ending is quite ambiguous (perhaps leaving room for a sequel?), leaving behind the moral that conflicting points of view can exist together without one having to destroy the other.<br />I only had a couple of gripes. Firstly, I thought the two central characters could have done with a bit more meaningful dialogue to develop them and their relationship. This may be a symptom of the second problem, which was that the English adaptation of the script was a little disappointing. I've only seen the film in English (I'd like to see it in the original Japanese with subtitles, which is possible with the DVD), and I thought the 90s American voices jarred somewhat with the mythic Japanese setting. Some of the voices fitted the characters quite well (Gillian Anderson's character, for example) but others just seemed out of place, like the warrior monk who sounded like Hank off King of the Hill!<br />However, overall I enjoyed the film very much and appreciated its lessons. It addresses contemporary issues without detracting from its status as an exciting mythic tale.
0345347951|5.0|I borrowed  &quot;Childhood's End&quot; from my boyfriend for the simple reason that I had just finished a book and was looking for something new to read. I had heard from several people that this was an excellent book, and 50 pages into the story, I was about to put the book down for the night. It's a good thing that I didn't ...about 4 hours later I read the last page and was moved to tears! This book raises so many questions about science, society, and humanity in general that it will be with me for a very long time...without going into the plot (it should be evident from other reviews), I will say that the characters are excellent and well-developed in a relatively short number of pages and the pacing of the story is very good (moderate enough for details and character build-up, but not so moderate that it induces boredom). This book gives nothing away about the ending and it's a definite &quot;page turner&quot;...In my opinion, no review can really do this book justice, as its main strength lies in the feelings it evokes in the reader: You have to read it to experience it!
B00003CXIY|5.0|Road Trip is definitly one of the funniest films I have seen in along time. The cast is great and there are a number of jokes and gags to keep you lauging during - and long after the movie has finished. Not to mention the extras on this DVD are great. There's a behind the scens tour and cut scenes from the film which are also great fun to watch. This is a must buy DVD!
0446310786|5.0|What an excellent book!  This story of a small southern town torn by a young girl's accusation of assault is one of the best books I have ever read and deserves every award and accolade it has received.  I just wish Ms. Lee would write more books.
B00005B36H|5.0|Is it possible to write just 1,000 words describing this epic mammoth of an album? The bizarre packaging says it all---Tool is a unique rock group. They are certainly not your average animal, and you can tell this much more after listening to &quot;Lateralus&quot; than listening to &quot;Aenima.&quot; You hear a lot less of Maynard on this album than on previous albums, and believe it or not, despite how good he is, this could be considered a good thing on some songs. Straight to the track-by-track:<br />1. The Grudge 9/10 The quiet section in this song is a little quiet compared to the sonic blasts of power in other parts of the song. A great opener though. 2. Eon Blue Apocalypse 10/10 Why give an interlude 10? Because this fits the mood perfectly. After the very loud and powerful ending of &quot;The Grudge,&quot; it leads to this. It seems almost as if the CD is exhausted from &quot;The Grudge,&quot; and only at the very end of this quiet instrumental does it utter a few quiet singular notes. 3. The Patient 7.5/10 A little too quiet. Probably the worst on the CD but, hey, it still has a 7.5! 4. Mantra 9/10 Does its only job, which is to lead perfectly into &quot;Schism&quot;. 5. Schism 10/10 I can understand why this was the radio single. This one leaves you in awe, both sections of the song and the interlude in between them. 6. Parabol 11/10 The lead-in to &quot;Parabola&quot; is breathtaking.... 7. Parabola 8/10 After realizing that they had a good idea going with the slow song-perfect intro into fast song, they then realized that they had to throw together a fast song to justify this. This is just that. 8. Ticks and Leeches 10/10 Great hard-rocker with an awesome quiet middle section. This song is the perfect example of just how Tool have mastered their genre. 9. Lateralis 9/10 Yes, it is spelled differently than the album title. Even the loud parts are somehow trance-inducing. However, the electric guitar solo at the end (8:20-9:24) threw me off a bit, as it sounds quite different than the rest of the song. 10. Disposition 10/10 PERFECT lead-in to the epic &quot;Reflection&quot;...quiet vocals...leads you into a trance. 11. Reflection 11/10 This picks up on the trance of &quot;Disposition&quot; and takes off and runs with it. Has beautiful and obviously digital vocals from Maynard in this epic piece. This song runs over eleven minutes! And, boy are you glad of it when you listen to it. Sometimes, it seems eleven minutes too short. 12. Triad 9/10 From &quot;Disposition&quot; and &quot;Reflection&quot; to a completely opposite side of Tool. I like the slowly-fading outro, it is just Tool at their best, following such a powerful song with a slow-fading outro. 13. Faaip de Oiad 8/10 Some guy mumbling about UFOs and stuff...slightly scary intro and very scary ending though. Overall: 121.5/130. DEFINITE 5 stars. (you need just 105 out of 130 to get 5 stars.)
B000002IWH|5.0|I love everything about this CD. The music is so awesome and suits the mood of the movie so well that no other non-orchestral soundtrack can touch it. It starts out with the brilliant and atmospheric \\"Burn\\" by The Cure, and then gradually descends into wickedly intense, guitar-driven masterpieces from bands like Nine Inch Nails, Rollins Band, Pantera, For Love Not Lisa, and Jesus and Mary Chain. The album then ends with two excellent, melancholy tunes with women vocalists which gives the listener a rest after the insanely cool rollercoaster of alt-rock/metal before it. I'm not a big fan of Rage Against the Machine, but believe when I say that every other song on this album is an absolute gem!
B000000OUJ|3.0|this is an OK cd. The reason i gave it 3 stars instead of two is because of one song, labels, which is probably my favorite song by a member of wu tang gone solo of all time. On labels you get GZA incorporating at least one of each major record labels into each song, and it sounds REALLY tight. The rest of the songs are pretty bland and dull but i would at least listen to this cd, just to hear labels. (track 1 is allright to)
B00000253N|5.0|This Is By Far Bob's Best CD.This Cd's Worst Song  Is Better Than Most Band's Best Song.
B00000J7JO|5.0|For someone who likes a variety of music, I feel that Californication just has a great blend of classic Chilli Peppers music and slower tunes, which are just as hard core in content as the other songs on the track.  Around the World and Otherside are great songs, but believe it or not, Road Trippin' is just one of those tracks that will forever stick out in my mind.  Overall, this CD is a great buy, no matter the price, and I wouldn't trade it for anything.
0446608955|5.0|Truly, I cannot come up with the right words to express the way this novel made me feel. It was almost magical - the romance expressed in this novel was utterly beautiful, beyond anything I have ever read before. The love expressed in this book was tender, tragic, and full of emotion. I am only 17, and yes, I am a hopeless romantic, but this novel was much more than a love story. It was a novel that taught how love can change lives, bring out the best in people, and how unexpected life can change. This novel was intriging - from the first word to the last. Though the book isn't huge in size, it didn't need to be. I put this book down feeling like the story ended with wonderful and powerful words. This book is about two teenagers, who hopelessly fall in love and start a soul-searching journey that I couldn't help but fall in love with. I truly love this book - I have read it twice, and I feel that anyone who appreciates a wonderfully written romance that is innocent and heartfelt, not in the least lustful, should read this book. It will make you laugh and it will make you cry, and in the end, you will be smiling.
B000002AZ8|5.0|OK, so Vitalogy was worlds different from Ten and Vs.  I say &quot;Good.&quot;  Ten had been done.  Vs. had been done.  It was time for Vitalogy to come alive.  If you are thinking about writing a review that trashes this album, STOP where you are.  Go listen to this album from start to finish without interruption.  Then listen to it again.  And again.  And again.  After you have done that, write your review.  I must say that this album is a masterpiece.  A couple of weeks ago, I sat down and listened to Ten, Vs., and Vitalogy front to back, all in a row.  I thought I could finally figure out which was my favorite, but I could not.  It is impossible.  After Ten finished playing, I said to myself, &quot;That one is the best.&quot;  After Vs. finished I said the same about it.  After Vitalogy finished I was tempted to say the same about it.  I came to this conclusion:  As ROCK albums, I like Ten and Vs. about equally just a little better than Vitalogy because of their blistering guitar solos.  Nevertheless, as MUSIC albums I cannot say that I like any one of them a bit better than the others.  Ten, with its balanced feel and barrage of rock staples, is a giant.  Vs., with its raw, honest sound, assures all who hear it of Pearl Jam's brilliance.  Vitalogy does the same thing, but it is more layered.  The band did not grow lazy, they just grew.  You have to listen closely to this album to discover just how much the band grew musically.  This, in itself, shows how brilliant Pearl Jam is.  In fact, in the long run, Vitalogy is the most challenging PJ album.  This review up to now has been speaking mainly to those people who have not discovered that Vitalogy is a masterpiece.  Hopefully it will help open their eyes (or ears).  Now I will focus on the album's content.  The opening song, the dark rocker Last Exit, is very different from anything on Ten or Vs.  That's what makes this album so challenging, the song structures are so different.  Next is the crazy rocker Spin the Black Circle.  one word: WHOA!!  Not for you, another memorable rocker, is a masterpiece in itself and structured brilliantly.  Tremor Christ is one of the most brilliant songs Pearl Jam has ever written.  It is structured so beautifully and differently that you just get lost in it.  I can't begin to describe the pictures I get in my head while listening to this album.  It's almost like Vitalogy is some mythical musical mansion and each song represents a different room.  The next song, Nothingman, has a great mood and is one of PJ's best ballads.  The other three masterpieces on this album are Corduroy, the catchiest song here, Better Man, which is as close to perfection as the album gets, and Immortality, which is another dark, haunting song.  Whipping keeps you on edge while Satan's Bed talks about resisting temptation.  The three short songs are not throwaways but add diversity and attitude to the album.  The last track is rather annoying, but I listen to it nonetheless.  It contains excellent background music and it is rather disturbing.  Well, I believe that is an adequate review.  In closing, I'll say that if you truly explore this album, you will get lost in the process for quite a while.
B000001GBJ|5.0|This CD is so relaxing and wonderful to listen to.  My mother and I spent 8 hours listening to it over and over while we addressed my wedding invitations.  I'm definitely using a couple of the songs on my special day.  It's terrific!  My mom and I were very impressed!  Barbra Streisand liked it so much that she took the track to number 8 (&quot;Heartstrings&quot;) and recorded lyrics to it on one of her albums.  I didn't realize this until I listened to her album and the song was uncanningly familiar.  Then I read her notes on recording the song.  I would recommend this CD to any music lover!
B0000025RI|5.0|This album is the greatest-selling album of all time, and with good reason. But just because it has sold upwards of 40 million copies, doesn't necessarily mean that it is the greatest album of all time. But it still deserves 5 stars, and it probably is the greatest in its genre. This is an album that appealed (and still does) to all ages. From its up-tempo dance tracks to the ballads to the epic title track, this album is truly timeless, and it would be nice to see it remastered with maybe some bonus tracks. I, for one, would buy the new copy. Booklet includes all lyrics.
B000024D4R|5.0|there's really only 2 kinds of pf fans. the one's who think dsotm is the pinnacle of their career(those are the ones that know them almost exclusively from classic rock radio stations or were fortunate enough to see them during a post waters tour and were greatly impressed by the visual impact, which was probably due to them being drugged)and the fan that not only regards animals as the pf masterpiece but as a supreme musical statement. i fall into the latter. the centerpiece here is of course &quot;dogs&quot; which is best described as &quot;wagnerian&quot; relying heavily on an &quot;endless theme&quot; approach with the major changes being gilmour solos that are not only beautiful but convey the bitterness and impending doom of the lyrics. &quot;pigs&quot; opens with an eerie keyboard idea that is developed well though nowhere near that of &quot;dogs&quot;, and &quot;sheep&quot; basically cuts loose and treats us to one the bands most cohesive straight out jams. if you like this album seek out bootleg performances.
B000001C6D|5.0|Paradise Lost is one of the most underrated Metal bands of all time. They came up with this gem in their 4rth try that rates up there with Master of Puppets, Iron Maiden, Reign in Blood and Master of Reality. It is heavy but very melodic with fantastic lead guitar from Gregor Mackintosh and a semi growl from Nick Holmes. Almost every cut is a winner with great dynamics, lyrics and pacing. Why this CD is currently unavailable is beyond me, it is truly a headbanger's treat. One of the great CD's to end the golden age of metal 1970 - 1994.
B000002952|5.0|A very special and personal CD by my favorite singer. Mi Tierra is a masterpiece, and Gloria's first Grammy winner.  Translations and a small dictionary of Cuban words and sayings are included. She's so pretty on the cover, and the lyrics &amp; songs are even more so. Mi Tierra is probably her most accomplished release to date.
B00005B4GU|5.0|The new Radiohead work is awesome, full of beautiful sounds, deep melodies with great lyrics, in some tracks you can hear the best electronica, in others you can hear cool rock sound, \\"Amnesiac\\" has managed to build up an impressive sound collection influenced for the past, present & \\"THE FUTURE\\"... One more time, Radiohead dazzling us with a great music... RADIOHEAD is \\"the future sound in music\\" The future is \\"RADIOHEAD\\"... and the future is now... RUN... to buy it!!.... NOW!!
B00004XONN|5.0|after listening to the first 20 seconds of &quot;everything in its right place&quot; i knew this was going to be a great cd.   i wasn't disappointed.   my advice to people out there is to just listen to the music and not the band.   preconceived ideas about what a band should sound like is of no use.<br />i had only purchased &quot;ok computer&quot; before this cd.   i'm not a die hard fan of radiohead.   both albums are worthy of five star status.
B000002VTE|4.0|...a difficult record, it must be said. Following their breakthrough 'lazer guided melodies' and the astutely refined 'pure phase' comes 'ladies and gentlemen we are floating in space' a 70 minutes + romp through the solar system which is at times incredibly draining, the transive and monochromatic drones of 'broken heart' and the dare-devil psychedelic experimentation of 'the individual' are far-reaching in scope and demand constant attention to detail if not to be completely misheard as deranged bits of noise and madness. however, the more tuneful, pop-minded elements make this record worth owning. 'stay with me', 'i think i'm in love', 'ladies and gentlemen..' and the breathtaking 'cool waves' are truly landmarks as far as progressive pop music is concerned. a genuine and satisfying leap forward from 'pure phase'. not just masters of the studio or anything bland like that but true art, timeless, wonderful, experimental and refined.
0788821075|5.0|I suppose you could call Julia Roberts in this movie a modern day Eliza Doolittle without the cockney accent.  Julia never looked better, even dressed as a hooker she can't look bad. This is one of those feel good movies you will want to watch over and over again.  Great cast all around.  A must have for every home video collection.
6304432461|5.0|This is one of my favourite all time action movies.  Die Hard is what made Bruce Willis a big star. And he makes one extremly violent hero. It is filled with over the top action and some really good performances, especially by Alan Rickman as the terrorist leader Hans Gruber. Only a year before the director John McCtiernan made Predator and with this sat a new standard for action movies. Bruce Willis plays NY cop John McClane who is on his way to Los Angeles to spend the Christmas Holiday with his family. He is invited to the Nakatomi Office building where his wife is working. Before anybody realises it a small but deadly group of terrorist has taken over the building. Everyone except for McClane is taken hostage. McClane now has to fight the terrorists, survive the police and FBI assaults and save his wife. An action classic, no doubt about it.
B00003CXSM|5.0|Delicious dialogue, heartfelt characters, this movie is simple but charming and full of heart. I didn't expect to like it and found myself loving it. It's unexpectedly quirky and fun...
B00005B4GU|2.0|Jesus.  As someone who warmed to the difficult, but strangely beautiful &quot;Kid A,&quot; I eagerly awaited this title, particularly as the buzz indicated a more &quot;song oriented&quot; spin on the previous work.  &quot;Amnesiac&quot; is a bin of cast-offs from the &quot;Kid A&quot; sessions, and is the most tedious album I've heard since Yes' &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; way back in my teen years in the '70s.  Boring drones dominate the proceedings, with even more filtered vocals and obtuse melodies.  It's all well and good for Thom Yorke to feed his Brian Eno jones.  It's quite another thing to confuse ambience with art; creating one doesn't guarantee the other.  Excellent production rates it two stars.
B00003CXP1|5.0|I'm a great admirer of Pi, the director's first film. Requiem is simply remarkable. So many (too many) books and films try (and ultimately fail) to give us a sense of our drug culture, but this film succeeds on every level. Its take on the insidious presence of drugs, of one sort of another, in all our lives, sounds a loud cautionary note. And Hubert Selby, the author, has always taken a very hard, penetrating look at the views around him. This time (perhaps because of the film desecretion of his fine book Last Exit to Brooklyn) perhaps his involvement played a significant part in keeping the film so on track. <br />With stunning performances by the entire cast, especially Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto, this is a scarily accurate view of how drugs, of whatever kind, can creep in and overtake our lives. A film about desperation, loss, and illusions, you must see Requiem if you have any interest in (a) an outstanding bit of filmmaking and (b) how all-too-easy it is to follow the rabbit down the hole.
0452282152|4.0|Girl with a Pearl Earring is a wonderfully pleasant read.  Not too challenging or mindboggling, just an imaginative story that I think most people will enjoy.  Tracy Chevalier has come up with an interesting concept--she takes an enigmatic Vermeer painting--The Girl with a Pearl Earring--and weaves an interesting and well-written story about it.  Griet is a young woman whose family's financial luck has changed after an accident leaves her artisan father blind.  She is hired as a teenage girl to work in the Vermeer household as a maid and soon, because of her own artistic sensibilities begins secretly assisting the artist.  Griet ultimately models for the famous painting, and the conflict it causes is her story.  There are many other stories swirling around Griet, those of her own family, the Vermeer family and Peter, a young man she meets at the market.  I found this an interesting read, perfect for a warm summer's day, when you are searching for something a little more substantial than the usual summer fodder.  Enjoy.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Released only seven months before Amnesiac, Kid A is the most cohesive, liquid album to ever come out Radiohead. It is, one could argue, a more pure 'concept album' than 1997's Ok Computer. From first to final track, Kid A throbs with a detatched intelligence, slithering along in increasingly tight downward spirals, gathering momentum until the soberingly icy 'morning bell' and the grandiose, irony-laden love ballad 'motion picture soundtrack' (a prime Radiohead cut). Amnesiac is a companion album, I would maintain, both thematically and technically, though it depicts a deeper slice of the Kid A tableau. Amnesiac sits square in the center of the mad eye of the apocalypse, a troubled voice changing seats frantically.<br />Initally, Amnesiac album feels like a true sequel. 'packt like sardines,' the tremendous 'pyramid song,' and even the terrifying, robotic 'pull/pulk revolving doors' are fueled by a classic Kid A aesthetic: numb, uneasy bewilderment. Things get really strange at 'you and whose army,' a terrific boozy character piece which puts Thom Yorke at a piano in the corner of a dark longue. &quot;Come on,&quot; he goads, &quot;you and your cronies,&quot; before errupting into the anthemic battle-cry refrain &quot;we ride tonight.&quot; At this point, Amnesiac seems to affirm its schizophrenic persona, toppling headlong into a series of nightmarish vingettes - there is a general conveyance of psychological instability not witnessed by Radiohead fans since 'climbing up the walls.' A slow, truly chilly re-working of Kid A's 'morning bell' (here subtitled amnesiac) leads into the dark, pulsing acid-groove of 'dollars and cents,' Amnesiac's most sincerely threatening and confrontational moment.<br />A surprising moment of clarity arrives with 'like spinning plates,' a tense piece with backwards-mixed vocals and strobing synth-effects - one hears quiet shades of fear, mortification... maybe even regret. It's a fantastic come-down, essentially ending Amnesiac withoutanswering any questions or providing much comfort. The album simply departs. As the credits roll, Radiohead plays a funeral march - the unsettling jazz epilogue 'life in a glass house' - and Thom, suddenly vocal, declares that he'd &quot;love to stay and chat.&quot; The unexpected presence of vibrant horns is unnerving; the shaken listener is mocked by the cinematic, smiling turn. It's brilliant.
0140042520|5.0|Many fans of Kerouac adore On the Road, but feel that it's missing something. On the Road lacks a certain sensitivity and does not give enough credit to the potential of human interaction. In The Dharma Bums, Kerouac fills in the gaps of On The Road, with stunning prose that sometimes portrays a subtle, serence atmosphere and sometimes knocks the reader over. A must read for fans of the Beats, or anyone in any way interested in Buddhism.
6304286961|4.0|I don't think that film is 100% factual but the overall performances and effect make up for my doubt. It's the perfect project for Stone: his unique, atmospheric, disturbing direction brings to life a unique, atmospheric, disturbing individual. Kilmer is in top form, giving a very credible portrayal.
0060194995|5.0|Every year I re-read this book. It's one of those captivating novels that you just can't put down. Ms. Lee's narrative voice is charming and graceful. As a writer, after reading this book you can't help saying to yourself, &quot;I wish I could write like that!&quot;
B00004VVNC|2.0|Well intended but unsatisfying melodrama with flat performances, a mediocre recreation of the time period, and a story that has as much wit and subtlety as a pro-wrestling match. You've seen it all before: complications of love between two brothers, a World War I subplot, and Hopkins overacting! This movie could have been made fifty years ago, and made much better, with stars like Gary Cooper or Spencer Tracy as the father, Liz Taylor as the young woman, and Rock Hudson and Montgomery Clift as the two sons. Well, at least that's who I see as the leads.
0843108827|5.0|Mr. Uppity is the story of a man who thinks very highly of himself. But after visiting the goblin king, he begins to treat others nicely. A very funny book, great illustrations, and a wonderful story for all ages.
0767834976|1.0|Here are the ingredients for making a summer blockbuster hit: a big name star, a pretentious theatrical preview, loud action, and a PG-13 rating (hey, they want people of all ages, kids and their parents, to make it break records). But it fell flat  since Ah-nold's prescense doesn't make up for a lack of plot, the action scenes were laughably substandard, and its  competitor was JURASSIC PARK. Recently, I rented it as a time killer and what I got was just a total waste of time. It's so maniplutive and derivative in how it borrows elements from classic foreign cinema to the Hollywood classics of the 40's and 50's to Woody Allen's PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO to all the successful teen comedies/dramas/adventures. Even die-hard fans of Schwarzenegger will be very, very disappointed.
B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica has to be the greatest band of all time, in my opinion. Every CD they've put out has been pure metal, and no one rocks better than these guys. &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; could very well be considered the best of the best. <br />When you look at Metallica albums, they're easily separated into old school and new school, with the line typically drawn right before the Black album. RTL is the best of the old school Metallica. Every single song on here rocks, pure and simple. You've got thrash (&quot;Fight Fire w/ Fire&quot;), you've got two of the band's best live songs (&quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; and &quot;Creeping Death&quot;), and the best rock instrumental ever (&quot;Call of the Ktulu&quot;). <br />If you want to hear the best of the old school Metallica, buy this album. Hell, if you buy any Metallica album, you can't go wrong with RTL.
B000021XS0|5.0|There are a lot of great progressive metal bands around these days. There's the symphonic and stylish Symphony X, the increasingly evolving Fates Warning, the original and daring Pain of Salvation, the technical powerhouses Power of Omens, and many others.<br />But among them all, Dream Theater remains the best. To me, no one else defines progressive metal like these five brilliant musicians. They strike an incredible balance of power, technique, emotion, and melody with a unified vision possible only with the remarkable degree of chemistry these guys share. And, in many ways, Scenes From A Memory is their best work.<br />Here's the skinny: It's a 78 minute concept album whose story stems from the original &quot;Metropolis&quot; mystique from their breakthrough album Images And Words. This is the album Dream Theater wanted to make all along, with no pressure from their label, and no regard for commercial success. It's a feast for the music lovers, with a good enough ear for composition and melody that the technique never overshadows the song. Dream Theater's critics love to attack them for going overboard with solos and instrumental sections, but it's never bothered me simply because they play with a lot of heart. John Petrucci is an outstanding guitar player who never restrains his technical ability, but most importantly he plays with a tremendous amount of soul. The encouraging heroics of his solo on &quot;The Spirit Carries On&quot; encapsulate this idea better than anything. It's pure beauty in music.<br />DT may not be able to repeat the greatness of SFAM, but if they continue to make the music they love, there will never be another good-but-flawed Falling Into Infinity. They will continue to take great strides beyond their peers and continue crunching the mold to their image while making some of the best music out there.
B00005JA2B|5.0|The band's classic 1976 release remastered and never sounding better.  Their reproduction is a marked improvement from the previous release and an absolute pleasure to listen to.  You'll hear instrumental notes you never heard before and will fully appreciate the outstanding musianship displayed throughout. This is especially true of Steve Walsh's vocals which are simply inspirational.  The music speaks for itself so there is no need to review the quality of these songs.  The two additions to this CD, live versions of COWS and Cheyenne Anthem, are tremendous  with a clarity unavailable when &quot;Two For The Show&quot; was recorded. The version of Cheyenne Anthem was recorded live in 1977 at the old Paladium Theatre on 14th St. in NYC.  I was very excited to read this as I attended both shows there performed by the band  during the Leftoverture tour.  When I read this in the liner notes I thought back to how exciting this time was for Kansas and their fans as they began headlining shows.  The electricity in the theatre that night was incredible, especially when the band opened with COWS, their big hit at the time.  It was a testament to the confidence and ability of the players that they would open the show with the only song the majority of the audience ever heard from them.  Well to say they kept the crowd's intererst is an understatement. Two hours and two encores later, the band ended with this version of Cheyenne Anthem with the curtains closing as the final passage was played.  It continued as the crowd exited. Simply majestic, and something I still remember 25 years later.  Do yourself a favor and buy this CD and relive the glory of the essence of a classic American rock band.  &quot;Carry On&quot; Kansas and thanks for the music and the memories.
0060392886|5.0|Reading this book brought me through the ups and downs of the band like I was with them.  I've never tryed herion, but boy this book made me feel what it was like to be a junkie.  All the questions I ever had about the band were answered and more.
0767836324|5.0|What an absolutely fabulous movie! Screw the critics who saw it and said it sucked. They probably didn't watch it at all, or more likely,they sure as hell aren't in touch with their inner child.<br />But enough about that. This is a truly touching movie. I fancy myself to be pretty tough, but the first time I got a look at granny Wendy I cried I was so sad. <br />The cast is stellar.With Dustin Hoffman,Robin Williams,Bob Hoskins and Julia Roberts being the best. This movie really  does bring you back to what it was like to be a child.<br />The characters are lively and interesting, with Hook at the top of &quot; Good Form&quot;. His first scene was truly memorable and creepy.<br />This is also a really good date movie, beleive it or not. There's just something about it that's so nice and romantic.<br />I highly reccommend this movie on vhs or dvd. A truly touching movie.
0385501560|3.0|After reading Survivor and Fight Club, i was emmensely awaiting Choke, but it was less than exquisite. Although poigniant and humourous at points, Choke was more sexual and outlandish than his previous works. In essence, the main character struggles to find meaning and substance in life while dealing with a sexual addiction, possibly being the son of Jesus and a withering, psychotic mother. Choke delivers a message, im not sure what it is, but it is worth your time, if your looking for something to waste a few hours on.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|I just saw the movie, and all I can say is, &quot;WOW!&quot;  It was stunning, it was beautiful, it was crazy, and it was a love story. The music from the film is fantastic, and Nicole and Ewan are a great vocal team . I too, am a little sad that all the songs from the movie are not included on the CD. They need to be, and I agree with the others when they say that another CD is needed.  Please give us the rest of the songs from the movie, in their movie format.  Go see this movie and buy the soundtrack, it is so worth it.
0786915749|4.0|This review will focus overall on the Chronicles trilogy, which i thought were some very good books.  The characters were well done, and the plot was interesting.  Actually, to say the characters were well done is an understatement. You really come to like them and to feel sorta like you are sharing the adventure with them. Two of my favorite characters were Tas and Fizban, because they are so funny. They bring the right amount of humor into these books that really made me enjoy the trilogy a lot more. By far the most interesting character is Raistlin, the mage, whose struggle for life and power is so real and cool. Him, always being sortof overshadowed by his handsome and strong twin brother needs something to distinguish him in this world, so he struggles to become the most powerful person in the world. His magic is very cool, as is Fizban's- who is absolutely hilarious in trying to cast his favorite spell, Fireball. The deaths in the book were well done, and brought more reality of life into these books, as did the fact that the characters werent all powerful. Yes, the group did have massive amounts of power and stuff, but they were still frightened by Dragons, and they knew their limits.  But some may think, if i give this book so much praise, why only 4 stars. The 1 star that i took off was due to the massive amount of things that were pulled from tolkien. maybe some of it wasnt on purpose, but there were just so many similarities. For example, the Elves. They were so much like the elves in the Silmarilion, with their Kinslaying, and division among the 3 groups. One of the most annoying similarities was the the Towers of High Sorcery, which held the dragon orbs. Those were so reminiscent of the towers which held the palantirs, it was annoying.  But other than my annoyance with the Tolkien likeness, i thought this was an admirable series, with many high points, along with a bunch of cool twists and turns in the plot. I would definately recommend these books.
B000001ESN|5.0|With 1978's HEMISPHERES, Rush appeared to be running out of gas as their progressive rock sound was concerned. Yes, while some people highly praise HEMISPHERES, I think Rush's fatigue was starting to show at this point. And with progressive rock pretty much out of style by the start of the 1980s (except for England's Marillion, who probably owed a huge debt to Rush), Rush knew if they were going to stay alive, they'd have to update their sound. So with 1980's PERMANENT WAVES, Rush begins a slow journey away from long-form works, but still maintaining their winning formula of thinking man's hard rock. Even in America, Rush's albums were what sold big, not a hit single. So on the surface, a song like \\"The Spirit Of Radio\\" would seem a bit overenthusiastic. But while mainstream radio success wasn't far behind for Rush, this song rather works as a bit of a good coincidence. I'm sure even in Canada, budding rockers like Rush tuned in regularly to their radios to keep up with the latest in pop music, and as the closing paraphrase of Simon & Garfunkel's \\"The Sounds Of Silence\\" states, maybe lyricist Neil Peart's influences aren't all intellectual. While that song would become a staple in Rush's concerts, PERMANENT WAVES has even more great works to consider. \\"Free Will\\" is an excellent anthem for freedom in all its forms, and is the earliest hint that Rush was taking progressive rock down a few notches into shorter, radio-friendly songs. Even at this point, Rush were stereotyped as geeky, technology-obsessed rockers, so the idea of Rush attempting a real-live love song may seem a bit jarring at first. But they succeed admirably with \\"Entre Nous\\", which is romantic, yet still maintains Rush's singular style. This is certainly not a song you'd find Journey singing, which may be a bit refreshing. Although it was the 1980s now, Rush wasn't quite ready to abandon their epic-songwriting style yet, and PERMANENT WAVES features two that, unlike the cry for help that was CARESS OF STEEL (1975), do work excellently. \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" is not one of Rush's more popular works, but it's still reminiscent of the music Genesis was doing when Phil Collins had officially become leader of the band, but they had not totally gone pop yet. This is one song I think Rush would do good by re-introducing into their playlist. Epic #2, \\"Natural Science\\", on the other hand, is one that only Rush would be found doing, and that's a plus because a great deal of Rush's music was in a style only they could replicate. Chances for cover versions that are even remotely faithful to the originals are nil at best. But Rush's influence on such modern-day bands like Primus and Dream Theater are easy to see, thanks to music like PERMANENT WAVES. While progressive rock hadn't really won over the Americans, PERMANENT WAVES became a top 10 album in 1980, and their biggest-seller since 2112. While the follow-up to WAVES would continue Rush's steps away from the past, the long-form songs on here indicate that perhaps Rush could carry on such a style with a few nips & tucks here & there.STEEL (1975), do work excellently. \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" is not one of Rush's more popular works, but it's still reminiscent of the music Genesis was doing when Phil Collins had officially become leader of the band, but they had not totally gone pop yet.

0679879269|2.0|I've seldom been so dissapointed in a book as in THE AMBER SPYGLASS.<br />The first part of this trilogy is a masterpiece, the best novel I've read in over three decades. The second is very good. This one is mediocre.<br />The problem is that Pullman has a Message: 'Have an Open Mind.' Unfortunately, none of the characters in THE AMBER SPYGLASS do. It never occurs to any of the 'Good Guys' to find out anything about the 'Bad Guys' on their own, to doubt anything they're told, or to use their brains to independently evaluate the evidence -- but then, they never bother to get any evidence.<br />And what the author does show us of the 'Good Guys' suggests they're as evil and ruthless as the baddies.  So who cares who wins?<br />A lot of the reviewers suggested that this series is &quot;better than J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series.&quot;  Hah!  THE GOLDEN COMPASS was better than Rowling, and THE SUBTLE KNIFE was almost as good, but THE AMBER SPYGLASS isn't even close.<br />It's a pity.  Pullman had the makings of a great series here, but he threw it away in order to deliver a lecture about 'thinking for yourself.'  Too bad he doesn't practice what he preaches.
B000001DU5|5.0|I could not believe my ears when I was 16 and heard TFF for the first time.  &quot;Mad World&quot; was like gospel to me then and it still stands the test of time (I'm 34 now).  This is a great collection for the first timer and new fan of TFF.  Enjoy yourself!
B000002KBU|5.0|James Taylor's guitar work on &quot;California&quot;, &quot;All I Want&quot;, and, especially, &quot;A Case Of You&quot; (surely Joni's most poignant song) enhances this, her best album. The CD is crisp at least compared to my worn out vinyl LP copy.
B000002HH9|5.0|On this album, the Cure does what it does best: it goes where none of its fans think it should go (upbeat); it goes where no one else in the music industry was going at the time (a little out of sync with what was currently popular); and it's very daring...new instruments, new rhythms. The album opens with \\"Want,\\" a five-minute tour de force that begins with 2 minutes of guitar riffs that sound like a wailing siren (much like Pornography's \\"100 Years\\"), before descending into Robert Smith's plaintive yearning for more... of everything. The album's next song is \\"Club America,\\" one of the few rock songs the Cure has written, with Robert Smith donning a detached, cool voice and reflecting on the trite, superficial club scene in the US, as he enters a club that (mocking the credit card notices posted at the front of nearly every American store), has a sign reading, \\"We accept all major lies, we love any kind of fraud.\\" The 3rd song, \\"This is a Lie,\\" is a measured and lush questioning of why we all believe we can only love one person forever. Whether you believe that Smith meant what he's singing, the song makes you ponder and doubt yourself, and your loved one, until...\\"The 13th\\" which was The Cure's rather daring choice for a 1st single from the record, as you find yourself in a small Brazilian jazz club listening to Robert Smith get snared by the provocative and seductive singer on stage, as she threatens to test his fidelity and ruin his relationship, yet he yells a triumphant, \\"but it feels good!\\" with each chorus as the horns blare in approving unison. Utterly fantastic and original, it was released as the first single instead of \\"Mint Car\\" because of the latter's infectious enthusiasm and glee and The Cure's fear that it would remind too many people of Friday I'm In Love, and thus limit the band's credibility as pure but thoughtless pop. \\"Mint Car\\" is a fantastic song, and easily the most unabashed shriek of happiness that The Cure's ever written. \\"Strange Attraction\\" was released as a single only in America (hence no video), yet it is a lyrical wonder, recounting a sexy love story between two people who share letters each year, when suddenly, like so many relationships, the infatuation period ends and so does the love. \\"Jupiter Crash\\" has a dreamy acoustic backdrop, and tells of the disappointment when we feel so much excitement and have so many expectations with new love that it inevitably disappoints us...much like the grand expectations we had when we expected a fantastic explosion when a large meteor collided with Jupiter, only to be quickly and unceremoniously swallowed by the larger planet. \\"Round & Round & Round\\" is a short and upbeat whirlwind criticism of the way we \\"fake it\\" with each other, and how we just can't seem to stop. The album's last single was \\"Gone!,\\" where flirtatious keyboards were paired with saxophones to create a nouveaux jazz sound; yet another example of The Cure's successful experimentation with new and old sounds to create something quite distinct. \\"Return\\" is also very upbeat, with shouts of happiness as Robert Smith is ironically mystified by the woman he thought he knew, dressed in PVC and tempting him to engage in adventures that both excite him and scare him at the same time...before he desperately asks for someone to \\"get me out of here.\\" \\"Trap\\" is a raucous cry for freedom from the low self-esteem one feels when trapped in a bad relationship; \\"Treasure\\" is a tender, melodic final request for a loved one to remember and smile, for \\"it's better to forget, than to remember me and cry.\\" The final song, \\"Bare,\\" is just that, a simple, 8 minute mini-epic that engages the reader in the singer's monologue when he realizes his relationship has been fueled on past happiness instead of dealing with the inability to relate to each other any more, before ending with the Smith repeating, \\"I will never forget.\\" This album is fantastic because it is massive, complex, diverse, and can be listened to over and over no matter what mood you're in, and this album alone can put you in touch with your feelings regarding any relationship you have or had. With songs like \\"Mint Car,\\" \\"The 13th,\\" and \\"Return,\\" you can always pull yourself out of the deepest and most prolonged blues, or if you'd prefer to let yourself sink in self-indulgent depression, there's always \\"This is a Lie,\\" \\"Jupiter Crash,\\" and \\"Bare.\\" This album is absolutely wonderful because you can use it for whatever you need to feel at any given moment. I can't recommend it enough.
B000007177|4.0|A surprisingly strong compilation of &quot;rejects&quot; from over the many, many years of the band's recording career.  It is a real hodge-podge which was released largely at the request of, and certainly for, those dedicated long-time Tull fans -- and I am among them -- who simply don't trust Ian and the boys when it comes to deciding what is worthy to grace an album.  As long-time Tull fans will attest, often they reject songs for reasons no one else can understand.  As we've found out over the years, through the compilation and retrospective albums that have been released, there is an amazing amount of truly outstanding material that gets buried in the studio vaults until someone goes digging for it for some reason.<br />The 1981 &quot;Broadsword&quot; sessions are a good example.  The list of &quot;rejects&quot; (as we've found out over the years) is pretty long, certainly long enough to have resulted in that album being a double album.  But what is more astounding is that the quality of these &quot;old warts&quot; is sometimes, arguably, superior to that of some cuts that made it onto an album.  In the 20 Years Box Set we found out that outstanding songs like Jack-A-Lynn, Jack Frost and the Hooded Crow, Motoreyes, Down at the End of Your Road, Overhang, and Rhythm in Gold, along with some others, were left unreleased from those sessions.  Now along comes Nightcap, a few years later, and we find out those weren't the only great tracks from those sessions that the band forgot about -- as out of the blue we discover the truly exceptional Crew Nights and Lights Out, along with some other pretty good efforts in No Step, The Curse, Commons Brawl and Drive on the Young Side of Life.  It leaves one wondering how many other little jewels are stuck in some vault somewhere.<br />And it isn't only just the &quot;Broadsword&quot; sessions that yield strong &quot;reject&quot; material for this compilation:  Silver River Turning and Man of Principle (which features a flute-led intro, middle bridge and outro that is based largely on Bach's Prelude and Fugue in D Minor) are exceptional offerings from the late 80's.  Piece of Cake, Hardliner and Rosa on the Factory Floor are also enjoyable presentations from that era.  How Broadford Bazaar, from the late 70's, never surfaced before this is almost unimaginable (but then we said that about at least a half-dozen cuts in the 20-Years Set too).<br />It is understandable why the band did not release some of the material here prior to this compilation.  As Ian says, some of them are &quot;just a little too different&quot; -- this applies mostly to the lyrics (subject matter) or the circumstances of the recordings.  Some of these were recorded between album sessions, and the music of the Chateau D'isaster tapes was, for the most part, reworked and released on A Passion Play or the later War Child (though the difference in tone between the original &quot;Chateau&quot; tapes and what finally became A Passion Play is striking).  All the same, some of the more unfamiliar material in the &quot;Chateau&quot; tapes is a real revelation: Look at the Animals is an absolute scream (as in hilarious, not loud).<br />And it is certainly understandable that Ian didn't care to release The Curse -- I've never heard a song on that subject before, and Ian does have a wife after all.  Let's just say that subject matter is...ummm...related to the biblical curse of women...ummm...well, its a...kind of...monthly thing, you know?  Pretty good song otherwise, with a great performance by Martin Barre on the electric guitar.  It's obvious why Sea Lion 2 didn't make the cut, and Quartet too, even though it is a nice piece which also, oddly enough considering Man of Principle, borrows from Bach's aforementioned Prelude and Fugue.<br />This is one of the most interesting of Tull compilations.  More so when you realize that in some cases these are double &quot;rejects&quot; in that they didn't get on the 20 Year Set from a few years previously.  In a handful of cases that is mind-blowing.  When you compare these studio rejects to other anthologies or collections by bands you can not help but be amazed by Tull's standards -- and in some cases you can't help but question their judgement in leaving certain tracks off their studio albums.
B000001ESP|5.0|PERMANENT WAVES helped Rush open the new decade with a bang. They were toning down their progressive rock intentions by making their music more conducive to Album Rock Radio, without succumbing to the format's often faceless restrictions. They had been endearing themselves to American audiences since 2112 (1976), but it wasn't until 1981's MOVING PICTURES that it seemed like the States had fully embraced them. I'm often clueless as to why some people say a certain album is a band's best, but I sometimes see why they would think so. And for MOVING PICTURES, which has received that treatment, I wouldn't argue too much about the album not being Rush's best, because it very well could be. Unlike PERMANENT WAVES's short 6 tracks (which was plenty considering the album's time length then), MOVING PICTURES ups the ante with 7 songs, further indicating that Rush was moving closer to the rock radar with their integrity intact. As for hit singles, Rush's time hadn't come up yet, but there were still plenty of songs that could have made it. \\"Tom Sawyer\\", \\"Witch Hunt\\" and \\"Limelight\\" have become standards of classic rock radio, thanks to their knack for giving a somewhat high-falootin' genre a taste of rock melody, as well as adding a much-needed smart factor. Nerd rock? Maybe, but some pretty damn good nerd rock at that. Rush still had a progressive heart, and MOVING PICTURES finds them giving the old epic one last go-round with \\"The Camera Eye\\". This one proves that MOVING PICTURES seems to have an unofficial concept running through it, being about the idea of fame and its consequences. Lyricist and drummer Neil Peart is said to be a very private man who doesn't endorse the rock & roll lifestyle, and it's on songs like \\"The Camera Eye\\" and \\"Limelight\\" that makes that known. After this, Rush would almost abandon the epic for good, shedding themselves of the last trace of progressive identity they ever had. With Rush changing their style for the better, the actual songs on MOVING PICTURES prove that this may have been a final decision for them, as the songs are just as good as their many long-form works. \\"Red Barchetta\\" (it took me a while to realize it was about a car), \\"Vital Signs\\" and the instrumental \\"YYZ\\" showcase the little-noted fact that Rush are some pretty damn good musicians along with writing a great lyric. These three guys are not your average music fans just picking up their instruments, that's for sure. MOVING PICTURES was an even bigger success than PERMANENT WAVES, peaking in the top 5 of the album charts, and selling the requisite million copies. Now that Rush had changed their style of playing music since 2112, it was time for another live album to showcase Rush's growth. EXIT...STAGE LEFT would come next, and again prove that Rush knew its way around a concert stage. And with less progressive, more mainstream (yet no less dazzling) music like that on MOVING PICTURES, Rush could only continue to add to their growing fan base outside of Canada.NG PICTURES prove that this may have been a final decision for them, as the songs are just as good as their many long-form works. \\"Red Barchetta\\" (it took me a while to realize it was about a car), \\"Vital Signs\\" and the instrumental \\"YYZ\\" showcase the little-noted fact that Rush are some pretty damn good musicians along with writing a great lyric.

B00003CX97|5.0|Within the Conflict that was World War II, there were many more smaller, more personal conflicts which, when added up, made a significant impact on the outcome of the War; though trying to explain them, or war in general, is like attempting to decipher the indecipherable.  In \\"The Bridge On the River Kwai,\\" director David Lean takes you deep into the Burmese jungle to examine some of these deeper conflicts, and the effects of extraordinary circumstances on some ordinary men:  British Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) is a man of rigid principles and ideals, to whom acquiescence in any quarter is not an option; Japanese Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) lives by an inflexible code of conduct and is adamant in his adherence to it, through which he maintains his dignity and honor; American Navy Commander Shears (William Holden) just wants to make it through the war alive and get back home.  <br /> As an integral part of their war effort, the Japanese have ordered a strategic bridge to be built across the Kwai River to facilitate the transport of troops and equipment.  This monumental task has been given to Saito, the commandant of an allied prisoners-of-war camp; and not only must he build it, it must be completed by a specific date.  And time is short.  Toward that end, Saito has pressed into service every prisoner, including officers, whom according to the Geneva Convention of 1864 (which established rules for the humane treatment of prisoners of war), are to be excluded from any manual labor.  When a fresh contingent of British prisoners arrives to bolster his complement of workers, Saito finds himself up against a formidable opponent, Nicholson, who immediately informs Saito that his officers will not work, in accordance with the rules of the Geneva Convention.  And it's the beginning of another war-- a war of wills-- between two men determined to win at any cost.  To Saito, this is more than just another assignment, it's an obligation, and failure is not an option.If he does not succeed in having the bridge built-- and on time-- he will be forced to take his own life, in accordance with his own moral code.  Nicholson, on the other hand, is unyielding to the point of madness, and will die before he accedes to Saito's demands.<br /> Meanwhile Shears has managed by some miracle to escape and has made his way back to Ceylon.  And he's home free-- after some recuperation time at Mount Lavinia Hospital, he'll be on his way back to the states.  Or so he thinks.  But unbeknownst to him, the British are aware of the bridge being built on the Kwai, and are planning a commando raid to destroy it.  And Shears has something they need:  First hand knowledge of the precise location, and of the jungle through which he made his miraculous escape.  Subsequently, the Navy agrees to \\"loan\\" Shears to the British, to aid them with their mission.  So instead of a ticket home, Shears is faced with another arduous trek through an uncompromising jungle, all for a mission of which the odds against success are nearly incalculable.  <br /> From the beginning of the film to it's spectacular climax, Lean builds and maintains a subtle tension that underscores the drama, which makes this a compelling, unforgettable motion picture.  Lean is the Master of epic films such as this, filling them with sweeping visuals while integrating them with the emotional involvement of his characters perfectly.  Lean knows what he wants and how to get it, and he takes a terrific story (and this definitely is one) and tells it by using every bit of space--visually and audibly-- at this disposal.  And most importantly, he knows how to get the kind of performances from his actors to put it all across so convincingly and believably.<br /> Alec Guinness deservedly received the Oscar for Best Actor for his role of Nicholson, whom he embodies from the inside out, disappearing so utterly into the character that the actor is forgotten, leaving nothing but the real man in his stead.It's a superlative piece of acting from one of the truly great actors of all times.  Holden, as well, delivers an outstanding performance as Shears, capturing that somewhat embittered, off-handed sarcasm and resignation of a man trapped by circumstances beyond his control, who nevertheless does what he can to make the most of it, while awaiting the first opportunity for escape that affords itself.  Holden's work here is Award-worthy, as well, but was destined to forever remain in the shadows of what is probably the definitive Guinness performance.  And what a rare treat, having two performances of this caliber in a single film.<br /> Other notable performances include Hayakawa, entirely convincing as the tormented Saito, and Jack Hawkins, as demolition expert Major Warden, the absolute personification of the undaunted British stiff-upper-lip.<br /> The supporting cast includes James Donald (Clipton), Geoffrey Horne (Joyce), Percy Herbert (Grogan), Ann Sears (Nurse) and Andre Morell (Green).  Beautifully filmed and expertly crafted and delivered, \\"The Bridge On the River Kwai\\" is one of David Lean's masterpieces.  It's an emotionally involving, dramatic action/adventure that offers some real insight into the determination and tenacity of the human spirit.  This film (especially the ending) is one you will never forget; a classic in every sense of the word, it exemplifies the magic of the movies.

0790737345|3.0|Wings of Desire (Wim Wenders), which City of Angels is (loosely) based on, is my all-time favorite movie. Which wouldn't necessarily mean that I would harshly judge City of Angels, but the parts I loved best about Wings of Desire - the very spiritual themes, the poetry, and the unusual camerawork and use of lighting and color, were completely lost in this American version.<br />Add to that the added twist at the end, and I was thoroughly unimpressed.<br />This movie, on its own, is okay for a &quot;date film&quot; - except for the ending, which only made me wonder why they did it that way. <br />But when it's another rendition of an incredible film like &quot;Wings of Desire&quot;, it's just a complete disappointment.<br />I'd say skip this one - and get Wim Wenders' film instead.
0375501851|2.0|When I bought this book I really wanted to love it, particularly because it was written by such a young author (which gives me hope as an aspiring writer four years Zadie's junior).  It was admirable for her to be published at such ayoung age, take on a substantial project, and have such a vivid writing style.  But there's just too much wrong with this book for me to praise it.  The characters were cartoonish (with the possible exception of Irie), the plot was choppy and sparse, and the ending was abrupt, impatient and dissapointing. Smith indulgently rambled through the story with a lack of focus and discipline, and as soon as I began to care about a character, she ripped him from the spotlight and exiled him to the background, sentenced to live out the rest of the novel as a one-dimensional cariature. When I finished, I felt like I had wasted my time. Zadie Smith has a lot of potential and will probably write a masterpiece eventually, but White Teeth just isn't it.  She bit off more than she could chew this time.
B00003CX95|5.0|Throughout the ages, oppression has taken many forms, rearing it's ugly head to deny the liberty and the rights of people everywhere, and the cry of \\"Freedom\\" and the inherent longing to be free of tyranny in any of it's many incarnations is universal and older than recorded history.  Man has fought on one battlefield or another and in one arena after another in an effort to rid himself of the shackles that bind him, and he has always paid a dear price for that freedom.  \\"Braveheart,\\" directed by and starring Mel Gibson, is the story of one man who would not abide the despotic rule of an unworthy sovereign, and took a stand against it.  A 13th Century commoner and a patriot who loved his country, Scotland, William Wallace (Gibson) burned with an unquenchable desire to be free of the British, who had murdered his father when William was just a boy.  Raised by kin, Wallace nevertheless grew up wanting only to marry, work his farm and raise a family.  But circumstances dictated otherwise, and without knowing what they had unleashed, the British rekindled that fire that burned within the boy, and Wallace soon left his mark on the Monarchy of King Edward I of England.<br /> Wallace was a man of singular determination, and managed to do what no one else had ever been able to do before him:  He united the clans of Scotland.  Before Wallace, the clans stubbornly clung to their autonomy, changed loyalties whenever the mood struck them or the price was right, and endured the domination of the British because of it.  Wallace changed all that, by convincing them that by standing together as one, they could win.  And he proved it.  He amassed an army and made a stand at York, and again on the battlefields of Stirling and Falkirk.  With savage tenacity and courage, he never gave in nor gave up his relentless and heroic quest to make Scotland free.  <br /> Gibson brings Wallace to life with a performance worthy of the man he portrays.  To achieve what he did, Wallace had to be larger than life, and that's exactly what Gibson brings to the screen.  But he plays him as a man, not a hero; Gibson's Wallace is very real, and someone you can believe would be able to stand before an army and lead them into battle.  In one memorable scene Wallace, mounted on a spirited horse, addresses his men-- many of whom had just joined him-- as they are about to engage the enemy at Stirling.  Someone from amongst the crowd calls out, \\"We heard Wallace is seven feet tall!\\"  To which Wallace replies, \\"I AM William Wallace!\\"  And by the time he finishes his powerful speech (which screenwriter Randall Wallace openly confesses was liberally borrowed from Shakespeare's \\"Henry V\\"), spurring them on and preparing them for the impending battle, you believe he IS seven feet tall.  It's an inspired performance through which Gibson shows you the man behind the legend, while at the same time he makes you understand just how and why the legend was born.  <br /> And, as impressive as Gibson is in front of the camera, what he does behind the camera with this film is even more impressive.  The magnitude of this film is awe inspiring, and that Gibson could carry it as an actor, while directing it as well, is quite a feat, indeed.  He used the bleak weather of Scotland and Ireland to great advantage in scene after scene, creating the perfect atmosphere in which to tell his story; he experimented with different camera speeds, especially when filming Catherine McCormack (Murron), which gave her a more graceful, sensuous look; he staged some of the most compelling battle sequences ever made; and he captured the intricacies of the characters-- all with an eye for detail and the ability to integrate it all into a film that took home the Oscar for Best Picture, while deservedly landing him the Award for Best Director.  It was obviously a labor of love for Gibson, but the hard work paid off handsomely in the end, especially for the audience, for it is they who realize the real fruits ofthis endeavor-- a truly stirring and memorable motion picture.<br /> The supporting cast includes Patrick McGoohan (Longshanks), Sophie Marceau (Isabelle), Angus MacFadyen (Robert the Bruce), Brendan Gleeson (Hamish) and Peter Hanly (Prince Edward).  A film of epic proportions, \\"Braveheart\\" is emotionally involving and inspiring, with a message about the irrepressible capacity of the human spirit.  Gibson put everything he had into this one, and it shows; this is his \\"Citizen Kane,\\" a pinnacle of achievement that few actor/directors every attain.  With brilliant cinematography (by John Toll), some of the finest editing you'll ever see (by Steven Rosenblum), terrific performances and Gibson's special touch, this is an unforgettable film that demonstrates what the magic of the movies is really all about.  If you love movies, this is one you simply do not want to miss.
B00003CXDZ|3.0|Moulin Rouge- an excellent movie, but would it do better on broadway? probably.      Moulin Rouge was set in 1900, when they were singing Madonna classics like &quot;Material Girl&quot; and &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; personaly I thought they should of had more appropriate songs for the era. I liked the movie in general- although that guy with the red hair freaked me out a little- And they needed to get more into the duke, It didnt make perfect sense how he got there. There where a lot of many little storys evolving around the love story of Christian,a writer from London, and Satine, a dancer at the moulin Rouge. I recomed this movie to anyone who like a musical or a Broadway musical especially.
B000002G6J|5.0|No more need be said. If you &quot;get&quot; Jobim - and this particular genre in musical history - or are are just starting out, BUY THIS. <br />Peel off the acetate, pop the disc in, settle back with your favorite soothing element (Martini? Girlfriend? Jacuzzi? Dinner Party?)and fall into the soothing, soaring, sparkling vibe.<br />Five Stars are too few, IMO...
B0000524E5|5.0|This Movie surprised me as well as got my pulse up. It really brings to life how things can really make a place work in this world.  It was one of the most entertaining films I have seen in a long time especially on such a low ended budget.  Best of all My 3 year old son loved it. It was also for the most part a very clean film= little violence and not that bad language like some films.
B00000IMCU|5.0|DAWN OF THE DEAD is a execellent horror because it has all the elements to make a great horror movie. Step 1: Have a Scary theme or topic, in this movie the theme is invasion of a scary things. Step 2: Have Strange Things scaring people, the scary things are &quot;zombies&quot; or the living Dead.  Step 3: have a scary soundtrack to go with the movie, in this case the Itallin rock group &quot;Goblin&quot; provides a scary soundtrack for this movie, they remind me of &quot;QUEEN&quot; when they did the &quot;FLASH GORDON&quot; Soundtrack because it was almost all scary keyboards and strange sounds. Step 4: Seek shelter in a cool place, the cool place in the movie is a shopping mall, Women whould like this movie because of that factor. The last step: have a good team to do a movie, the team i'm talking is director GEORGE A. ROMERO and make-up artist TOM SAVINI {they both have a part in the movie]. I personally recommend this movie to anyone who likes horror movies. I don't recommend this movie if you have a tight stomach.
B00005J73X|3.0|This CD was good but not great for a number of reasons.  First off, Bon Jovi broke the trend set by Garth Brooks, Guns N Roses, and Billy Joel and chose not to make this a double-live album.  Second, there were some noticable absences on the CD such as &quot;Always&quot;, &quot;I'll Be There for You&quot;, &quot;Bed of Roses&quot;, and &quot;Lay your Hands on Me.&quot;   Dibs on including the unexpected &quot;Something for the Pain.&quot;  But if you're going to have 15 tracks on the CD, make them 15 good tracks.  The never before heard tracks were an extreme dissapointment.  I personnally would like to have seen Bon Jovi's version of &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; which is a riot to see live.  It also could have been a little more diverse, such as including more tracks from the first two albums such as &quot;Breakout&quot; or &quot;Tokyo Road&quot; and more obscure tracks such as &quot;Blood on Blood&quot;, &quot;I'll Sleep When I'm Dead&quot;, &quot;Captain Crash and the Beauty Queen from Mars&quot; and &quot;Born to be my Baby.&quot;  So my advice, take this idea back into the studio, make it a double live album, and make the album more diverse and fun to listen to.  This one just seems like it was thrown together, rushed on the shelves, and not given any real creative thought.
0805062971|3.0|The first half of &quot;Fight Club&quot; is interesting and entertaining, but the second half of it ruins the book.  Once it gets outside of the fight clubs and into the end-of-the-millenium, blow stuff up type of junk, the book falls apart.<br />Overall, &quot;Fight Club&quot; was interesting enough, but I have to admit - and I usually don't say this - the movie was better.  David Fincher is amazing.  Fincher's direction and Jim Uhls' screenplay add so much more to the book.  Get the special DVD of &quot;Fight Club&quot; rather than the book.  You won't be missing much, yet you'll be gaining so much more.
B000002HMH|1.0|Maybe they didn't sell out, but Metallica is certainly no longer metal.  I think a name change is in line: Bluesica
B00003CWHS|5.0|ARMY OF DARKNESS is a classic in its own rights. This Limted edition Director's cut is rare and hard to find now, I found it at a Best Buy and it was in stock. By the way I own the VHS version. Th limited edition is the original movie before it was cut for US and International release, in other words this version of the movie as what Universal pictures and the MPAA had to watch bfore making decisions on the rating of the movie. The MPAA said it was &quot;A rated R picutre&quot; and Universal Said cut the movie movie by 15 minutes and put a happy ending. This version has the 15 of additional footage and the alternate ending and also includes 4 deleted scenes. My favorite ending is the Theatrical Version. This version is good but it is a collector's item. I Recommend this movie who like Horror/cult movies and collector's items.
B000006OAM|5.0|For fans of Natalie Merchant, this is a rare treat. Her voice is unusual, a bit thick, but definitely suited to the kind of songs she sings. The title song is really sensitive and touching. The others are equally good, and there should be no reason to dislike one, or like one more than the other, even though my personal favorite is &quot;Break Your Heart&quot;.  The last song &quot;When they ring the golden bells&quot;, is an amazing experiment in voices and tones. Splendid, is all I can say. You're not a true Natalie Merchant fan if you don't listen to this CD at least twice a day!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Don't get me wrong. I LOVE &quot;The Long and Winding Road.&quot; However, the version most people know is this heavily-orchestrated Phil Spector &quot;wall of sound&quot; mess that the song turned out to be on the finished &quot;Let it Be&quot; album. But the best and most moving version is in the film &quot;Let it Be&quot; (as dismal as the film is, it's worth seeing only for that song!) There's no orchestra or heavenly choirs, just Paul on piano with a bit of accompaniment. It's almost a spiritual experience, it's so beautiful. Paul was supposedly outraged when he heard the &quot;final&quot; version, and I can see why. Hopefully the REAL version of the song will be released someday so all fans can hear how it was meant to sound.
0553277472|4.0|This book is certainly a good book that engages one at many levels.  And i'll agree with the other reviews of it generally, but i would just like to point out that the view he puts forth of what Zen is, of what the Phaedrus (by Plato) is about and who the sophists were is completely off base.  His ideas are good but where he says he gets the ideas from is just poor study of the sources.

B00003CXDZ|5.0|Wow.  It's been out a week and I've already seen it four times and counting.  Directed by Baz Luhrmann (who directed &quot;William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet&quot;), &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is a dark and quick-paced story of beauty, freedom, truth, and above all, love.  Ewan and Nicole do their own singing and have beautiful voices...&quot;Roxanne&quot; still brings shivers down my spine.  A tragic romance, &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; will bring a tear to any feeling person's eye.
B000002UUX|5.0|Ok, first off, I'm biased about this album.  It was my first Megadeth album, and I had it in my car's tape deck for about 3 months straight back in 1992.  I can still hear the opening riff to Holy Wars bouncing around in my head.  There were a lot of great metal albums before and after RIP, but this was definitely my favorite.  You should have got this 10 years ago, but if you didn't, then buy it now and crank it up! P.S.  Their new album (World Needs A Hero) is worth buying too.
B00005B4GU|2.0|I got into radiohead with The Bends, although I had heard \\"creep\\" beforehand (who hadn't), and followed them through Ok computer, which is a near perfect album, but with Kid A I pulled in my reins a bit..I didn't really fully like it, but there were elements of it that I thought were great \\"everything in its right place\\" \\"idioteque\\".  There are some incredible statements on the album, and for me it works on an intellectual level..it appeals to parts of my mind, but its not something that I listen to all the time, because quite frankly its not all that inviting.  In fact its like listening to a band singing inside a bubble, you hear there reverberations, but you don't really hear them-you only hear extensions of their voices....  <br />And the thing is, I'm sure there are people who feel that Amnesiac doesn't really do it for them,  but because radiohead has almost become mythical in reputation, and \\"the can do no wrong band\\" there is almost an acquiescence to the band, because if we were to disagree with them, they might not put out anymore music. So the thinking is, even mediocre radiohead is better than no radiohead at all.  Not that I blame anyone, I mean if you look around, there aren't that many bands seriously \\"taking on\\" things right now, most of it is pretty escapist stuff i.e. fluffy pop..<br />But when I hear a song like pulk/pull revolving doors, I mean I start to wonder what is going on.  I feel as if I am being made a fool of, because its unlistenable.  Even pyramid song is a conjob. It starts off great, with requisiste melancholic voice, and suggests the song will have a cool trajectory, but it just keeps rotating on the same melody, so much so that Thom Yorke even repeats his opening line halfway through the song, almost as if he can't think of a new line for the song, so he rehashes an old one.  To me its all a waste of time, its total self-involved stuff, its as if the foundation of a song isn't good enough, so they veer off on detours and tangents,trying their best to get rid of any sort of structure...and as a result any sort of connection with the listener.  There are elements in all of the songs that draw me in, but then I am let down because there is no conviction...they all just warble around, like a top, and don't get on with it.  Amnesiac sounds like a band beginning to feed on its own tail....
B000002JSR|5.0|While not constructed as an album, the songs on _Coda_ mesh well, and especially good are &quot;Poor Tom&quot; and what could be my favorite LZ song, &quot;Wearing And Tearing&quot;.  The energy and tightness the band displays in &quot;W&amp;T&quot; can't be described to a sufficient degree in any language i know.  A criminally underrated recording.
B000059MEK|5.0|I never listened to this type of music until I heard 'One More Time', which is a very catchy song.  A lot of people don't care for this music, but this album has a lot of great dance tunes and I was pleased by the album from start to finish and in the middle, I was definitely liking a lot of songs there.  So I don't think you are wasting money if you go out and buy this.  But just make sure you are into techno/electronic sounding music or whatever you would like to call it..because if you're not, you will for sure dislike this.
B00003CX8J|4.0|This isn't that bad of a movie for a cartoon made into a real live action movie.  Most movie's people make a cartoon into a real live action movie are bad.  Like the Batman series.  I hate them.  I like the old ones, but the new ones are bad.  <br />It about this girl who finds out she is not normal.  She runs away and runs into Wolvirene.  Then she finds out he is not normal like her.<br />Then the two of them aciedentily run into a mutant school.  There they find they're mutants.  So the become apart of the X-Men team.<br />I'm not telling tou anymore, so you'll see the movie your self.  It is a pretty good movie, so see it.
B00003CXN4|5.0|Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones sparkle is this exciting fast paced drama with a powerhouse cast.  Multiple plots occur simultaneously while the film uses technical tricks like showing scenes at accelerated paces for emphasis, creating a blurry and hyper effect, adding to the drama.  The one complaint I would make is that the speed sometimes made me dizzy, as well as making it challenging to focus on the plot rather than the cinematography.  The primary plots of Douglas as a politician and Zeta-Jones as the wife of an arrested Cartel member from Mexico bring a human dimension to what would otherwise be a copycat version of Hollywood's drug movie stereotype by bringing to light the effects of drugs on their families.  I saw it on DVD, but I'd recommend it in a theater or on a wide screen TV.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
B000002H33|3.0|This is one of the Best Records ever recorded,The problem with the New CD is not the Music,but the sound.They print a warning on the back to tell you about the problems transfering Music recorded on analog equipment to CD's.This is a good thing because when you play this CD you will wonder why your old TAPE sounds better.That said... this is still a great CD and it's one of Metallica's Best.
B00003CXP1|5.0|Requiem for a Dream will appeal to fans of such spirit-breakers as \\"Magnolia\\" and \\"Happiness\\", and it does sport a similarly bleak assault on its main characters. This movie, however, lacks the distinctly misanthropic snarl of those two films. It requires empathy and, it is, after all, a requiem for the lost dreams, not only of the characters in the film but of every person who has destroyed their lives with drug abuse.<br />Having personally seen drugs decimate lives around me, I can tell you that these characters are archetypes of stories which have been played out again and again. Taken literally, this film is unbelievable. As amalgamations of the lives of real drug users, however, they're terrifyingly realistic. Heroin users can and do develop gangrene. Heavy amphetamine users do develop psychosis. Women who are addicted to heroin do get desperate enough to sell their bodies for the stuff and people who get caught do go to jail. While being a horror story about the dangers of drug use, this movie takes care to be believable in its portrayals not only of the effects of the drugs themselves but also the effects of those drugs on the relationships of the people involved and, more subtly on the reasons that people abuse drugs to begin with. <br />This film IS a cautionary tale and a masterful one at that. By building hope in the beginning of the film, the director draws drug users in to understanding and empathy. By his exquisite detail he lets them know that he's no clueless Nancy Reagan shouting \\"Just Say No\\" at a captive audience. Then, once they fully relate to the characters he leads them down into the spiralling nightmares of their possible futures.<br />...Ellen Burstyn is unforgettable and Marlon Wayans deserves mention for a remarkably mature performance. Also important is the Kronos Quartet for putting the real Requiem into the dream.<br />Praise aside, this film isn't for everyone. It is a fulfilling but not necessarily enjoyable cinematic experience. Myviewing companion ditched out 45 minutes into the movie screaming \\"I  can't take this!\\" and he LIKES \\"Happiness.\\"
B0000027F3|4.0|I never liked Judas Priest studio records before this albumn came out.They were always good live ,and I always knew Halford was one of the best Metal singers but the studio records never were as good as the Live ones.They were just way to poppy for me.But this Record changed my mind.I only wish rob Halford would have stuck around to make more CD's like this one.All the songs are worth listening to,and HalFord is amazing as usual.This is a concept albumn and I will admit the Concept is a bit silly,but thats not hard to over look as most of the songs are amazing.The only song that seems out of place on this CD is Touch of Evil.its not a bad song it just seems like it belongs on another record.If you like Pantara,Old Metallica,Megadeth exc. you will like this CD.
B00003CXN4|5.0|this movie is extremely good. it is very well made.  good performances and great directing. This is a winner.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Let me first say that I find it peculiar that so many people are commenting on an album that came out two weeks ago.  While this type of behaviour seems appropriate with say a Destiny Child or Creed album, commenting so prematurely on a Radiohead album seems almost idiotic.  Most people here are slamming the album for being to &quot;artsy&quot; and taking the easy way out and slamming the band for having some &quot;ego trip&quot; or something.  But the fact is, who or what the band is has nothing to do with the accessibility of their music.  I've had the pleasure of owning Amnesiac for about two months now (and yes, i recently PURCHASED the album) and let me tell you, it's an amazing piece of work.  Instead of comparing this album to Kid A, or OK Computer, why not look base your judgments on its own merits.  Just open the CD, listen to a couple tracks, recognize that it's different and therefore base your critiques on the album itself. When the Strawberry Fields video was played on American Bandstand all the kids in the audience thought they looked weird and they didn't like the song at all.  But I can probably tell you that all of those kids soon became fans after they sat down and listenened to Sgt Peppers or Magical Mystery Tour and looked at it on its own merits.  Now Sgt Peppers is recognized as one of the greatest albums of all time.  I'm not saying that Amnesiac or Kid A are in the same league as The Beatles, I'm just showing how premature judgments can backfire.  <br />One persons ability to relate to art relies on who they are and what they are going through (or HAVE gone through). I was going through a pretty strange time and therefore found Kid A and Amnesiac VERY accessible.  Almost eerily so. But for someone who's going through a different time the album might be totally inaccessible.  So most critiques, at least thoughts expressed here, are from different lifestyles and different pasts.  So recognize that just slamming an album for being weird or stupid does not take into account the fact that it is art and that truly great art can not be explained.  Try to explain why &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; is such an excellent achievement.  It's damn near impossible, but if you listen to it, you know it's amazing.  <br />Not everything can be expressed with words, and some things just shouldn't.
0783222955|1.0|I really hated this movie and still to this day can't see what was so great about it.  I thought it was one of the most boring films I have ever had the misfortune to watch.  I love Gregory Peck, he has always been one of my favorites, but I certainly did not like him in this picture, nor anything about it.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool has made a bunch of great CDs with awesome songs.  This CD goes to show you that Tool still hasn't been able to make a bad album yet.<br />This CD, however, is a lot softer and more mellow than the past albums, but it is still a great album.  There is not one bad song on the CD.  I like the fact that there is a band who can put out six to seven minute songs instead of short one to two minute ones.  This album reminds me a lot of Nine Inch Nail's The Fragile.  It has great songs like &quot;The Grudge&quot;, &quot;Disposition&quot;, and of course, &quot;Schism&quot;.  A great heavy track is &quot;Ticks and Leeches&quot;.  The only complaint I have is that there should be more songs, concidering that some of the tracks doesn't have any singing and are only instrumentals.  Other than that, this is a great album, and I have listened to it many times.<br />If you love the group Tool, then this CD is a must have.  Keep in mind that it isn't as aggressive or as heavy as the past albums, but it is still a great CD.
B000059XYA|4.0|I love Christopher Reeves as superman, the first one was by far the best one.  This movie was good up to a point.  Why do we have to have sex in everything we see nowadays?  In the comic strips of superman he didn't ever go to bed with Lois Lane and I felt the insert of that was totally unnecessary.  It would have been better without it.  Giving up his powers for her was foolish, thats what she loved about him, he was mysterious and different than all other men, making him exciting and giving her a sense of being someone special.  Without those qualities, he was just another man.  ....
630512762X|5.0|Usually when we go to see an action movie, we keep in mind that the movie may not have the best acting or story line, but we will have the opportunity to see numerous gun fights, explosions, chaos, and so on.  Well, I have news for you.  All of the above WAS true, until a movie called &quot;Face/Off&quot; came out.<br />This is unlike any action movie ever made.  The story is so deep, and the characters are portrayed in realistic manners.  There are memorable quotes in this movie, but they are in no way corny.  The story has to be what sticks out most in this movie.<br />Travolta is an FBI agent, who wants to take out the villian, played by Cage, once and for all.  The main reason is because Cage is responsible for the murder of his son.  Travolta is able to take care of Cage, or so he thinks, and it seems like everything is fine.<br />Until it is learned that Cage had planted a deadly bomb somewhere in L.A.<br />Now, Travolta's only hope is to undergo brutal surgery to transform his self into Cage, in order to get the location out of Cage's brother.  Who could've imagined that the real Cage woul wake up and trasform himself into Travolta?<br />This movie has it all; suspense, action, and drama.  There are great gun fights which will take your breath away.  The action is intense, but the story is even better.<br />The only thing I had a problem with in this movie was that Travolta and Cage could never hit each other when they were in the brutal gun fights.  Sure, they could hit the janitor, innocent bystanders, and the other baddies, but never each other!!  Oh well, I guess you have to have that element to make the movie last longer.<br />This is one of the best action movies ever made, and I would advise people to view this wonderful flick if they haven't already.  The movie is so good, that it is an almost guarentee that you will watch it a second time.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|WHAT a phenomenom!!!  Great film, I really shant call it a film because it was a musical theater production that a BRILLIANT production co. created to entertain us. GET A CLUE WORLD-THIS IS IT!!!
B00004SCX6|5.0|Admittedly, Britney Spears is not the strongest vocalist, but she is very pretty and has an infectious smile. What is more, her songs are catchy and entertaining. She is truly the reigning queen of pop, and you can put her cd on and let it play all the way through.<br />&quot;Stronger,&quot; &quot;Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know,&quot; and &quot;Lucky&quot; are pop masterpieces. Brit's talents are also showcased on &quot;What U See&quot; and &quot;One Kiss from You.&quot; In the future, Brit does need to change her formula some. But, for now, her cd is well worth the money. It is da bomb!
B00005BJ2O|4.0|I love the Film, More than anything I have ever seen, this is a Musical theatre film!! (BRILLIANT beyond words) (I have seen it 3 times) but alot of the songs on this CD are not in the movie, and alot the songs in the Movie are not on the CD.  What UP??  Lady Marmalaude is not even in the movie except for the mix during \\"Because we CAn CAn Can!\\"  So, When can those of us who ADORE this film get more soundtracks?  I want the real Deal!!
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool has delivered in my humble opinion the best prog-rock record released in YEARS!  Let&#8217;s compare Tool to Yes, a prog-rock band whose first CD was released in 1968 and see if I could show bizarre parallels.  Yes is a band of talented musicians whose singer is extremely unique with his voice and lyrics.  The first few records had somewhat of a rock/hard rock feel to the music and it always hints at something greater, much more powerful.  Tool is a band of talented musicians whose singer is extremely unique with his voice and lyrics.  The first few records had somewhat of a rock/hard rock feel to the music and it always hints at something greater, much more powerful. <br />Yes&#8217;s self tilted debut (1968) and Time and Word (1969) were albums like that.  Tool&#8217;s followed a similar path with Opiate (1992) and Undertow (1993).  All great albums that had killer music on them that had a somewhat rock/hard rock feel during their respective era&#8217;s.  In 1971 Yes release The Yes Album, and it shook the rock world with its denser, complex sound.  In 1996 Tool release Aenima, and it shook the rock world with its denser, complex sound. Yes in 1972 release Fragile.  To this day fragile stands as a creative high for a band that never let the grass grow under their feet musically for too long.  Bringing us to the present day and Tool has released Lateralus, which is Latin for, a creative high for a band that never lets the grass grow under their feet musically for too long.  Ok you caught me, that&#8217;s not what Lateralus stands for but the similarities are eerie if you ask me.  Even down to the artwork.  For Yes, Fragile marked the presence of Roger Dean whose artwork for Yes&#8217;s records were modern day masterpieces.  The team of Adam Jones, Alex Gray and Mackie Osborne create a modern day masterpiece for Lateralus.  So in conclusion Tool delivers a modern day prog-rock masterpiece....
B00004Y6O9|5.0|This is the finest van halen album ever and contains back to back classics, every song is amazing.  With the hits 'runnin with the devil', 'ain't talking about love' and the finest guitar instruemntal ever:'eruption'!  Other highlights include the hard rockin 'i'm the one,' little dreamer, feel your love tonite, jamies' crying.  All in all, a tops album.
B00001QEE6|5.0|This has got to be one of the best movies I've ever seen. It offers an enjoyable plot and lovable characters. One can't help but love Tramp, the streetsmart,charming scoundrel that he is. And Lady is adorable as a puppy, though she looses some of that charm throughout the movie. Jock and Trusty are a laugh, and you love to hate Aunt Sarah and her two cats, Si &amp; Am. Did you know Si and Am were originaly named Nip and Tuck? Even the songs are good. Bella Notte is a lovely song, and Hes A Tramp is fairly enjoyable as well. 'Lalalu' is fairly annoying, however. Good thing it doesn't play very long. And the song at the begging isn't a real crowd pleaser either. We Are Siamese is okay... Alas - who can write a rewiew for the most romantic animated movie ever without mentioning the *gasp* Spaghetti Scene. That scene is FANTASTIC. Romantic, sweet, adorable, cute...genius. I loved it.  This movie is a DEFENITE must-see. A real crowd please to the end!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Lady Marmalade is the only song I listen to on this cd.  Christina, Pink, Mya, and Lil' Kim kick on this song!  I absolutely love it, don't miss out on this cd!
B00003CXN4|2.0|I just didn't like this movie at all. I know it's supposed to portray the problems with drugs in our society, but could it be any more boring? I don't know why Benicio del Torro won anything for his performance...(he was better in \\"The Way of the Gun\\"). I probably won't watch it ever again.  Rent it first!
B00000JPH5|2.0|This movie was sooo lame. The songs hurt my ears and David Bowie's pants hurt my eyes. Jeeze man his dingle was dragging on the ground. Dumb songs, David's tight pants, what could possibly make the movie any more campy? Oh wait there were MUPPETS TOO!  This was a stupid, lame and all around retarded movie. I gave it another star because David Bowie had the courage to use a deranged hairstylist kicked out of Cats and wair the leatards that showed all of the bulges.
B00005B36H|5.0|To put it short tool rocks. Why not get it. Listen to tracs #5,#7 best songs on the album
B00001NFCY|4.0|A brilliant piece of production, &quot;Human Clay&quot; is a master peice of straight down the line rock. I bought the album after hearing the quite fantastic &quot;Higher&quot; in The Hard Rock Cafe in London. I was expecting an album of songs very much like &quot;Higher,&quot; I was not disappointed. Mark Tremonti's huge guitar sound and the even bigger sound of Brian Marshall's bass create an album of such mind blowing rock and roll that you just want to turn the volume up louder. The first two tunes, &quot;Are You Ready&quot; and &quot;What If&quot; are a prelude to a collection of songs that are loud and feature Scott Stape's fantastic voice which moulds perfectly with the guitar riffs.  &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot; and &quot;Young Grow Old&quot; are lovely sounding ballads with attitude. In my opinion &quot;Wash Away Those Years&quot; is the album's best song, it is wonderful. The sound can become slightly repetitive, you lose track of some of the songs but it is made up for with quality of the sound present! Put simply: BUY THIS ALBUM!
B00000I07P|5.0|The origianl album comes out in August, 1986.  Then it everything explodes and becomes the most sold album of 1987 with the help of the two #1 hits, &quot;Livin' On A Prayer&quot; and &quot;You Give Love A Bad Name,&quot; and the top 10 hit &quot;Wanted Dead Or Alive.&quot;  Album then sells nine million copies!  Wow!!<br />The album it self is just spectacular.  The acoustic guitar work on &quot;Wanted Dead Or Alive&quot; is just awsome!!  The upbeat songs (in album order) &quot;You Give Love A Bad Name,&quot; &quot;Social Disease,&quot; &quot;Raise Your Hands,&quot; &quot;Wild In The Street&quot; are some kick-butt (other word) songs.  They are well thought out and turned out great.<br />Their power ballads &quot;Let It Rock,&quot; &quot;Livin' On A Prayer,&quot; &quot;Wanted Dead Or Alive,&quot; &quot;Without Love,&quot; &quot;I'd Die For You,&quot; and &quot;Never Say Goodbye&quot; are also amazing songs that weave amazing stories of love, fear, and sheer joy.<br />I would recomend this album to anybody.  Not just the rocker...but the power ballad person as well.  Hope you like this album as much as I do.                                            -----Pianoman81386
B00003CXN4|3.0|I saw this movie on DVD , and I am not sure I understand all the attention it got . It tries to bring up layers of different story lines , as if you were to expect all of it will somehow come together at the end , instead you get a feeling of total disintegration ( maybe this is what is Soderbergh and his Oscar winning film editor are trying to accomplish). Too many characters wandering aimlessly in todays America. As  to the  screenplay , it is limited  to 4 letter word exchanges between the Drug Czar and his thespian daughter. The acting is horrible, Micheal Douglas can't utter his lines , the supporting characters are either stereotypical or miscast. As to the decision to film the mexican scenes in this sort of yellow haze , I find that as a strategy to hide the directorial weaknesses , and has this racist tone about it , as if real &quot;Life&quot;  is only lived this  side of the border. Some people have compared this to &quot;The Grandfather&quot; movies , it would be an insult to the viewer's intelligence. Finally a word about the character od Catherine Zeta-Jones , the film leaves as clueless as to how a pregnant caring mother suddenly develops a criminal and murderous streak. The best point of the movie is that in  The war on drugs , the  enemy is Within , it offers no advice , but hey you can always &quot;Just say no&quot;!
630169399X|5.0|This is a great look at Leonard Bernstein in action rehearsing/recording this West Side Story session. If you are fan of Lenny, you MUST own this. If you aren't a fan, watching this video will make you one. Truly inspirational.
B00005BJC7|5.0|Amnesiac is a great album. Although not better than OK Computer, it's really good, and better than Kid A. The only song I don't like is &quot;Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors,&quot; which is boring, to me. The other songs vary from pretty good to wildly successful and beautiful in that melancholy Radiohead way, like &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; and &quot;Life in a Glasshouse.&quot; The Limited Edition packaging is pretty cool, too. The book has good art and is a nice artifact to look at while you listen.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Slipknots album slipknot is brillant all the songs are violent but still with some kind of meaning behind them. this album was so good that i went to germany to see them in concert but they canceled so iam going to see them in manchester on the 4th of november instead. I never thought that i could find any one whom sung like correy from slipknot but that was untill i meet matt on holiday he knew all the words and could sing them so much like correy anyway i can't wait till the new album lowa comes out on august 7th cause this album was so good. Kayleigh Bradley
B000002J0N|3.0|Vocally this in very easy on the ears.  The tunes are pretty polished as well and Cathedral is a true gem.  Shadow Captain is pretty as well with the rolling piano accompanyment.  However, the general impression here is that this batch is too soft.  Even the heavy rocker I Give You Give Blind is softened with a stringed orchestra.  None the less fans of the band should pick this one up.
0805062971|5.0|I highly recommend Fight Club to anyone who has seen the movie and has enjoyed it.This will give you more insite about the movie.I had to read it for school.I'm glad I did.I couldn't put it down,and I'm not one to read alot.So two thumbs up....5 starts...mucho enjoyed!!
B00000269M|3.0|This release has many \\"good\\" songs particularly Smooth Criminal, Bad, Liberian Girl, and The Way You Make Me Feel. However the overall flow of the CD just does not compare to the immortal Thriller. The same balance of textures from loud to soft to funky just does not exist here. Liberian Girl breaks the mold a little but the other tracks are semi-generic. Decent, yes but certainly not a classic except maybe for hard core fans.
6303369170|5.0|This was one of Johnny Depp's earliest feature films after his multiple seasons on the television show &quot;21 Jumpstreet&quot;, which made him a famous teen idol. He promptly went about trying to dismantle his teen idol image after finally being free of his television contract. He decided to star in the John Waters film 'Cry Baby'; his part was a teenage juvenile delinquent, circa 1950's. This being a John Waters film guaranteed the neccessary irony to offset the shallow,insipidly earnest scripts which he apparently suffered through on T.v.  'Cry Baby 'allowed him a taste of artistic freedom, and an oppurtunity to mock his past.  <br />Cut to 'Arizona Dream', a confident step into Depp becoming what we know him as today, a smart, gifted, unpredictable wizard at what he does.  People often say he is unpredictable, but in a way this is predictable, however, I really never know what to expect from him. People say he plays lost souls, and that is fine with me, because the reality of the situation is, aren't we all?    <br />'Arizona Dream' is the story of Axel,a a young lost soul, naive, fragile, sincere, with an uncomprimising dreaminess, which verges on mystical.  He is placed in a prediciment which forces him to deal with issues of family, love, and abandonment.  The film weaves together the lives of two seperate families which this character is involved with.  Axel attempts to follow his heart and his own judgement regarding these people, which puts him through the gamut of human emotions.  <br />By the end of this movie this young man could easily succumb to a morbid sadness, and allow his innocence to be stripped from him, turning back out into life as brutal realist, no longer willing to follow his dreams and whims and pause in the face of life's devasting beauty.  But magically, and naturally, his innocence is unmarred, his tenderness remains intact. In the wake of tragedy he is able to remain grateful and the last scene of him walking through the empty wind-whipped street at night in his grief proves this.  <br />As he lays down next to a resting cat upon the old Cadillac which has been covered in a clothe, inside of a Cadillac dealership indefinately closed for business and chained up,he is dignified and serene and filled with love and acceptance.  The whole interspersing of the Eskimo story is surreal but it ties it all together, the themes of wonder, innocence, tenderness, transformation, and life in all of it's devestating beauty.  <br />I believe Johnny understood this as much as his character by the end of this film, and drawing from his filmography he has not looked back since.  So, if you are a Depp fan, or simply a hopeless dreamer, this movie provides Johnny at his best, and some good, fun, spiritual nourishment. P.S.  It is also a very funny film with other well-known actors in it who are fantastic, not to mention the cinematagraphy and music are gorgeous. Also, I live in the area where this movie was filmed and I am thrilled to watch a film view this place with the wonder of the eyes in which i see it. Open your heart when you watch this movie and let it take you away!
B000002H38|4.0|I think that 'Watch your Step' isn't as good a track as the ones preceeding it, but that one bad song doesn't mean that Rapture isn't an EXCELLENT album, 2nd only to Compositions. The best tracks on it were 'Sweet Love' 'Been So Long' and \\"No one In The World.' The only thing seriously wrong with this album is that it's too short. If you don't have this CD, go out and get it.
B00004XOWM|5.0|This is probably one of the best albums of the year! Some people automatically believe that if an album is liked by many people it's bad, and unoriginal. Have you ever considered that the reason might be that it's very, very good? To all you who have to be so original and show &quot;special&quot; taste in music, get the sh**t out of your ears and listen...THIS ALBUM ROCKS!!
B00005IBGQ|5.0|I have been collecting music for over 30 years, and I am amazed that, as jaded as I am, it is still possible for somthing to come along and floor me like this album has. This album is more than merely flawless; I have never heard such a fantastic blend of evocative and often poignant lyrics, gripping and original melodies, and magical arrangements.  On top of all that, Rufus has a voice of great range, depth and flexibility.  All these elements to combine to move the heart and capture the imagination of any listener; gay, straight or in-between.  As Robert Schumann reportedly said of Chopin; &quot;Hats off, gentlemen; a genius.&quot;
B000002ADT|5.0|This album defines the genre for all others. In my opinion, the finest blues music ever performed by anyone.
B000002KHB|5.0|In the eyes (and ears) of many, &#8220;Machine Head&#8221; is the quintessential Deep Purple album. When my peers start throwing round labels like heavy metal pioneers and hard rock landmarks, Machine Head is, like it or not (the band themselves don&#8217;t), the one they cite to back up their claims. The fact that the album contains the perennial millstone round the neck song and the bands best known song &#8220;Smoke On The Water&#8221; merely secures to further this train of thought.  Now, nearly thirty years on, the songs sound just as super charged as they did then. Underpinned by a tight rhythm department, metallic riffing from that doyen of society, Ritchie Blackmore, just a touch of a classical tinge in the keyboard breaks and text book &#8216;tongue in the cheek&#8217;, totally politically incorrect lyrics, all beautifully balanced with a clear modern sounding production job (engineered by a very young Eddie Offord), the album is still influential today. Musical shops across the world constantly have to brace themselves for yet another generation of spotty strat-copy buyers eager to impress with their dodgy attempts at Machine Head licks on the object of their dreams.  The songs themselves were to be the lynch pins of Deep Purple sets to the present day, seeing them through several lineups and reformations. In fact, Deep Purple&#8217;s last live album, &#8220;Total Abandon Live&#8221;, contains four of the seven songs recorded here.  The kick of &#8220;Highway Star&#8221; remains as powerful as ever. An opening shot few bands ever get close to emulating, pushed on relentlessly by Ian Paice, some glorious bass work from that master of the dirty side of Rock &#8216;n&#8217; Roll, Roger Glover, Ian Gillan&#8217;s distinct screams, but it&#8217;s the work of Blackmore and Lord that really make everything tick (or should that be thud). Blackmore&#8217;s riffing is the best it has ever been, broken up by some oh so casual chord bashing. What is basically a very simple song structure is kept so busy that you hardly notice it as both Blackmore and Lord merge, the former throwing in a meticulous solo, which still thrills. Ian Paice, in turn, gives him the room to stretch for just so long before bashing back in as if to say: &#8220;Time Up!&#8221; To think that this song was written in the back of the Transit van on the way to a gig and then performed that night makes it all the more remarkable. It has stayed in every set list since then either opening or closing the show.  There are no fillers on this album (in fact, the fantastic &#8220;When A Blind Man Cries&#8221;, recorded at the Machine Head sessions had to be left off, eventually emerging as a flip side), they are all rock standards now. &#8220;Lazy&#8221;, with its dramatic organ introduction, was a logical extension of Lord&#8217;s on stage work. It drives Jon firmly back into the spotlight as he and Blackmore trade fun on a fast bluesy-based vehicle made for solo-ing.  &#8220;Space Truckin&#8217;&#8221; closes the album and gets back to the heart of Deep Purple in its original version, before Deep Purple took it out onto the boards, and eventually dragging it out into a 30 minute explosion of pure, hard rocking brilliance.  A lot of Deep Purple fans were turned on by the explosive live album &#8220;Made In Japan&#8221;, issued less than a year later. Machine Head (which, as usual, provided the bulk of the songs) suffered in comparison. However, at the end of the day it&#8217;s always the originals that stay with you the longest.y simple song structure is kept so busy that you hardly notice it as both Blackmore and Lord merge, the former throwing in a meticulous solo, which still thrills.

0671024256|2.0|It was a pleasure to read this book. It gave me some inspiration and more will to write. If this book was prose, I'd definately give it full 5 stars, but the fact is that this book doens't teach you almost anything about writing. Yes, it tells you to write each and every day, preferably at the same time and at least some specified amount of words, but who wouldn't figure it all out himself? Besides, the book tells in fact mostly about Stephen King himself; his past and stuff like that. What does it have to do with writing? If you're a fan of King and interested in writing, this book is for you. Otherwise, it's not worth the money. There are better books out there, just go and find them.
0060392886|4.0|Having been a rock groupie and no stranger to the Sunset Strip scene, I was STILL blown away by the antics of this band! Motley Crue redefined &quot;excess&quot;, and I'm amazed that they were able to make music amidst the chaos and partying that was their existance.   Some of the things the band did were horrifying.... and I don't shock easily.   I recently met Nikki Sixx at a signing, and he looked hot.  Vince looked a bit more worn out, but the girls still flocked to them. For any Crue fan, this book is a must read.

0790729628|4.0|I could never make it through this cold, special effects driven film and I know why. It's is just plain uneven! The effects left such a major impact that the film never allows the script-if there was one to develop. Ridley Scott is known for this kind of style but he seems to have allowd a little bit of growth over the years, but this is an earlier work and it's so cold that you need a parka to watch it!! The first few times I fell asleep watching this &quot;film&quot; and going in I was wide awake. All the elments in this film just don't mold. There are some directors who meet the mediums of both style and substance such as Proyas and Burton. The film does have it's shinning moments but alas all that glitters isn't gold. I do give Scott credit the final scenes make the movie a must buy and it desrves to be an underground classic. But what truly makes this film a purchase is the atmosphere. The pitch black shadows only being lit by the neon lights of a long abandoned earth. The planet is now being used for criminals and the rejects. Harrison tracks down the robotic made criminals and kills them with an eagle eye vengance! But is harrison a robot himself? The film does have the romance and emotional depth  but it is played in a sorta pseudo color film noir style! You HAVE to pay attention and even think ahead at times to keep up! Daunting? Yes! But mesmerizing, non the less!

0790749815|5.0|Every element in North is done to perfection Hitchcock is at his most self indulgent and that is a good thing in this case. The color pops thanks to the tranfer to dvd and the script is as beautifully written as Shakespeare! The film begins with a hilarious situation playing on Grant's under comedic timing and never stops or slows down. The injokes are plenty between Mason and Landau's characters less than subtle sexual interest in each other. You have to be really sharp to catch it but it's evident or Eva marie Saint's dubbing of &quot; I never have Sex on an empty stomach&quot; The Rushmore scene alone is worth the purchase if you are looking for a film that throws every element from one of the best film directors and creative geniuses of all time into one of the best action films. The plot takes more twists and turns then juice through a crazy straw. We go from hotel room, sex,  torture, to Grant running in a corn field being chased by a crop duster that comes through with such percision, that you think its gonna crash in your house! Hitchcock is simply amazing!
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I must admit, the first 40 minutes or so left me wondering whether this whole film was a joke, it had too much silly, eccagerated acting and humor, mixed with deepfelt, romantic scenes..very confusing. Some people got up and left the theatre at this point. How very sad for them! Because WOW..suddenly the whole movie shifted into drama, love and passion, and the very first love song scene melted my heart. Ewan and Nicole CAN sing! And when they act it seems so real, you just sit there with a silly grin on your face and go &quot; aaawww&quot;. From then on, the movie picks up pace both in plot, intensity and beauty. Some songs were written originally for this movie, and they are unforgettable. Most of the musical intermezzos were playing on or flat out making fun of other songs, like Madonna's &quot;Like a virgin&quot;. You will have to atch it to see how they managed to put this all together to a whole. The costumes, the ambiance, the filning, it was all unique, like nothing I have ever seen before. That alone is amazing. I highly recommend this shw to anyone willing to put up with a silly beginning, it is so worth it in the end! My daughter and I struggled hard not to sob out loud the last 40 minutes, and I never cry at movies! This musical is simply impossible to stick in a box and shrug at, it slipped past all my defences and cynicism and I found myself actually experiencing overwhelming emotions in response to Ewan's huge, blue eyes and Nicole's dramatic passion.
0790729377|5.0|Burn baby burn! This film should not be watched in the summer due to the fact that the excessive heat may cause dehydration and death! This film is so well acted and so well cast that it amazes me every time I watch it. Vivian Leigh truly fought for this role she wanted to be know as an actor jusr like her husband Laurence Olivier and she accomplished that goal. She gives Blanche depth and a masked beauty that is truly a marvel to watch and the entire cast does an amazing job of resting and falling into every scene-infact nobody miss-acts or seems to be reaching to get the emotions just right that the whole damn cast deserved to win Oscars that year and for Marlon Brando not to win for his gut wrenching Stanley was just plain criminal! This film is drenched in lust and sexual overtones that the gritty black and white color seems not to cool the steam but add another layer of white hot heat. When Brando swaggers or Leigh demures or Malden whimps it's pure magic. And more than a few people confuse this film with reality when it is based on moral stucture only the characters are based on different parts in everyones personality and when the &quot;raw&quot; and &quot;animalistic&quot; Stanley &quot;rapes&quot; the &quot;dumure&quot; and &quot;self conceited&quot; Blanche to me it symbolizes human nature winning over the false pretenses of human culture. But buy this film and decide for yourself.
B00003CX8J|2.0|Apparently considered to be the breakout performance of Aussie native Hugh Jackman, X-Men delivers what most consider to be an exciting mix of fantasy and adventure.  All I can really see in this film is a mish-mashing of unrealized characters and confusing lines of dialogue.<br />Now, for quite some time, I considered myself an X-Men fan, I only had about some 25 comics based on the mutated humanoids.  So, naturally I had at least 15% of my conscious self involved in the decision to see this movie.  Of course, my interest in the comic book heroes kind of died out about 3 years prior to the release of the movie, so I wasn't really into it.  Anywho, what I saw in the theaters came near to disgracing what the comic had set out to achieve.  Then again, what does a comic really give us besides a series of storyboarded illustrations.  <br />The movie X-Men proves to be less than even a series of random displays.  Obviously (for anyone who's seen the previews) they chose Wolverine to have the main part.  I guess I can see that, but why Rogue as the other main character?  And especially, why Anna Paquin as Rogue?  I don't really know what the casting director was thinking.  Much less what the screenwriters were thinking.  I absolutely love Storm's lines (ex: &quot;Hold on to something&quot; &quot;Do you know what happens to a toad when it is struck by lighting...the same thing that happens to everything else...&quot;).  I mean, come on.<br />Plus, we only get to see Professor X for about 5 minutes before he has an anuerysm and falls faint for the final thousand minutes (or like what it seemed like to me).  Finally, we see the oddly cast Ray Park as Toad, fresh from his identical role in George Lucas' Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.  If you simply must have the X-Men experience, read about five of the old comics, they'll cost less than this thing.
B000059WOD|1.0|First off: To anybody who even thinks for one second that Linkn Park is metal, well, your sorley mistaken. Hybrid Theory is a sick, a sad song. I hate it. The only song I'd buy it for is A Place For My Head. If you want a true metal album, check out Slayer - Diablous In Musica, Slipknot's first one, or Metallica - Kill 'Em All.
0812550706|5.0|Having never read an Orson Scott Card novel before and not being a particular fan of SciFi, I was doubtful when my daughter suggested I read it.  But she insisted, and so I did-- in one sitting!<br />I won't waste your time telling you about the plot. You can read the main review above, but after now having read several of Card's books, here are my thoughts. Some might disagree, but I think there's an order to reading these books: (1) Ender's Game - Don't read the teaser chapter for Shadow of the Hegemon if it's in your copy or it will spoil parts of Ender's Shadow. (2) Ender's Shadow - not next in the series (actually, not in the series) but read 'Shadow' while 'Game' is still fresh in your mind. (3) Speaker for the Dead - Part 2 of the series. (4) Xenocide - um, part 3. (5) Children of the Mind - well, this would be part 4. (6) Shadow of the Hegemon.<br />Then, once you understand the workings of Card's mind and writing style, you might try 'Lost Boys' even though it is a completely different type of story. Just a thought. <br />P.S. Don't ruin this book by reading all the reviews. Some of these reviewers don't understand it's impolite to give away the ending.
014028009X|5.0|Bridget Jones hase elements of just about all my single friends. Desparation, resolve, the ability to laugh, a good stiff drink every now and then, and snogging with a random guy to feel better. She was lucky to get a Mr. Darcy. We're all still looking.
B0000024W3|1.0|For all the brilliance of Bob Dylan in the 60's, this may have been his first major misstep.  This album has nothing to boast of save Days of 49, a rocker with raw energy and gritty style.  Unsuspecting Dylan fans beware.  Check out Highway 61 Revisted, Blonde on Blonde, Blood on the Tracks and Bringing It All Back Home instead.  That's my two cents.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park is one of the best cds I have ever bought next to Limp Bizkits new album and everclears american movie pt 2. Linkin Park is a mix of rap and rock. I realy enjoyed It.
B000002JS0|5.0|ACDC with Bon Scott practically defines rock &amp; roll, and this album is one of the loudest, most energetic and all out fun collections of hard rock ever put out.  So the songs aren't deep.  Let's be honest with ourselves, rock and roll was not invented to probe the inner depths of the soul nor answer life's huge questions.     What High Voltage does offer is some eardrum testing rock.  The opening track, It's a Long Way to the Top, announces ACDC's presence with an infectious guitar riff that'll have you bobbing your head and slamming your hands in seconds.  Rock and Roll Singer is a nice follow up, keeping pace with the element of glee in Bon's lyrics (oh, I should mention that every tune on here features Angus Young cutting loose at least once).  The Jack defies (this could be a stretch) critics that claim ACDC's lyrics are juvenile and &quot;unclever.&quot;  Ok, so it's still juvenile, but it is clever.  Then we get to the two best tracks, first, Live Wire.  This is a brilliant rock song that deserves more or even any airplay.  It's a fist-pumping jam with a brilliant little guitar transition somewhere in the middle, not to mention Bon's voice delivering great lyrics (I'm as cool as a body on ice, hotter than some rolling dice).  And of course, TNT.  I always want that song to be longer.  The album slows down a tad with the next few, which are still solid, and then the title song &quot;High Voltage&quot; finishes it off with enough energy you're sure to be shouting along.   So rock fans, if you aren't familiar with this album I suggest you become familiar.  And as much as I like Brian Johnson, Bon Scott's ACDC just had more attitude.  That's certainly evident in this album, as it is in Let There Be Rock, Highway to Hell, and of course Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap.

B00005BJPO|5.0|Don't be fooled, the above quote is for the true Akira fans out there ; ) <br />I must say, it's about time that this movie makes it's way to DVD. This is one reason I got a player so I could own this on DVD, rather than my chewed up old VHS copy I've had since the movie was available in the late 80's. I'm sorry to hear that the original dialogue will not be included in this release, ....To all those that have never gotten the chance to see this film, do your self a favor and buy it, you wont regret it. If it doesn't make much sense, watch it again, if that doesn't work, read the preceding line. If you want to learn more about this fantastic story, look for the newly published graphic novels, you will learn more about the characters than two hours could ever permit. Find out what Akira really is. <br />Keep in mind, Akira was the most expensive movie ever made for it's time, using state-of-the-art animation and computer graphics, putting this movie over the top for it's original release date and setting the standard for the next generation of anime, with titles like \\"Princess Mononoke\\". In the end, I will be sure to be the first on my block to own this DVD, just like I did with the VHS version so many years ago, it's worth it, it's that good...
B000001EL7|5.0|OK, The reviewer of this CD isn't up to the facts. Her statement that this was last album with orig. members is false. There are 4 more which are as follows: ALIVE II, Double Platinum (greatest hits type package), Dynasty, and Unmasked. Please get your facts straight. The CD is excellent and the rest of her review is very well done. &quot;Tomorrow and Tonight&quot; is another great listen.

0060168366|4.0|Johnson's &quot;Modern Times&quot; was, in the opinion of Richard Nixon and plenty of other people worth listening to, the best nonfiction book of the Eighties. It sold an amazing 6 million copies.<br />The rest of his books, while always interesting, aren't in that class, but then, what is?<br />His History of the American People is lively and sweeping, with lots of fascinating idiosyncratic looks at entertainment and the arts. The problem is that the proofreading and fact-checking are shameful. Johnson is getting on in years, so he's making more minor mistakes. Since this book was a guaranteed best seller, the publisher should have hired some starving American History Ph.D. to read the manuscript and fix all the little faith-sapping things wrong with it.
0790732254|5.0|I absalutely loved this movie!  I think it is one of the most complex copletely entertaining movies I have ever seen!  This picture is a great example of actors at the top of their game, Liz Taylor and Richard Burton blew me away.  For those who write bad reviews of this movie (for the most part) just don't get it.  I will admit that this movie may be of little interest to those who just want the norm, but for those who love groundbreaking powerful movies, this is for you.  The entire movie takes place over one night, so as it gets later and later the characters get more tired and more drunk, and you get more tired with them, you feel like your part of the movie, sitting in on one of the most fascinating marriages in cinema history.  I would suggest this movie for anyone who wants to venture into old Hollywood great cinema pictures.
B00005B4GU|4.0|On first listen, I really thought Radiohead might have reached the end of a great run, and that they had finally sacrificed musical appeal, in the name of originality.<br />But I also thought that about KidA and OK Computer. And so I listened to Amnesiac again, and I have to concede it is another great album. It contains their trademark - originality, whilst retaining enough of the Radiohead identity to satisfy fans like me.<br />It's too early to say which tracks appeal to me the most or why, I just know I am going to enjoy finding out.
B00005B4GU|1.0|I cant begin to say how disappointed I am with this album.  I just wish they would go back to the days of ok computer.  But its another experimental artistic album which in my opinion has definately NOT hit the nail on the head.  Apart from the song knives out the rest of the songs are completely weird and the drum beats are terrible.  I really hope radiohead has disappointed me for the last time and hopefully one day they will go back to playing the music which made me worship them. ie songs like airbag, creep, talk show host.
B00004Z459|4.0|Hybrid Theory is one of the hottest albums on the planet in my opinion and Linkin Park are well on the way to being the biggest band in the world. I bought the C.D in Chicago when I was visiting from Belfast. I heard \\"One Step Closer\\" and I didn't like it at first, and the video seemed a little messed in the head but later my friend let me listen to the album in class and I became hooked. So when I saw it on sale I bought it. I was surprised at the amount of people who didn't even know who Linkin P were in the states. People say that it is formulated and follows a set pattern,maybe, but it sounds amazing and that's what matters. \\"One Step Closer\\" which had started to grow on me before I bought it, turned out to be the worst song on the album. It was towered over by \\"Papercut\\" and \\"In The End.\\"  The videos for \\"Crawling\\" and \\"Papercut\\" were good and I hope that they release one for \\"In The End.\\" The music is catchy  though not annoyingly so. Bennington's sweet lyrics mix well with Mike Shinoda's rapping. Shinoda's mc-ing is slightly pretentious but it suits the sound as opposed to having DMX rapping to guitars. Brad Delson does a great job on the guitar and his playing is evocative of James Heittfield from Metallica. Decksmaster Joseph Hahn although not exactly DJ Muggs, knits the sound together very well and even has his own track, \\"Cure For The Itch.\\" The songs are radio friendly not like for instance, a Pink Floyd 8 minute effort. The top songs are \\"Papercut\\", \\"Crawling\\", \\"Runaway\\" and \\"In The End.\\" All possess melodic lyrics and big sound which blows your head off when you hear it and I constantly find myself pressing the replay button on my C.D player.    The one criticism is that even though the songs are radio friendly, it would be good if they were a bit longer and there were more of them. The future will only get brighter  and even though the album maybe not for the Metal Purist in the mould of the Deftones or Rage it is nevertheless a brilliant bit of workand is well worth buying. I can't wait for the next one and if all the expectations add up it will be pretty special.
0446310786|5.0|As a student in high school I browsed this book with little enthusiasm and look back on that callous transgression as a bitter mistake.  Now as a literature instructor I have read many novels, both new and old; I have not yet uncovered a text so rich in revelations of the common thread of humanity.  I now teach this book as the core of a Civil Rights unit, dealing primarily with the 60's era in the united States.  Excellent comparisons can be made between Ghandi's speech on &quot;Peacful Protest&quot; and Martin Luther King's passionate, &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech.  If you let this one get by you, please go back and read it!
6305428220|5.0|At first,I only watched this movie to see my favorite actress(Famke Janssen),even though she only has a bit part.But after I first saw it,I wanted to watch it again,and again,and again...oops,got carried away.It has a sorta-twist ending that I predicted correctly,but still entertaining.(If you've seen the movie you know what I mean*eyebrows raise*)Anyway,here's a scenario for the sequel:A teacher has a kid stretched on a table.Kid:&quot;What are you going to do to me?&quot;Teacher:&quot;Oh that's easy;I'm going to give you:<br />....a pop quiz.&quot;Kid:&quot;NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!&quot;
B00005B4GU|5.0|For those disappointed with Kid A's less guitar-driven sound, don't seek solace in Amnesiac. The album has it's differences from Kid A, yet is nearly identical in technique and sound - not suprising, both were produced and I believe recorded in the same sessions. As with Kid A, Radiohead continues to explore the boundaries and facets of pop music...shifting from strange cascades of beats and noise to more quiet, distant pieces. On the strength of the brilliant You and Whose Army alone - a gloriously melancholy piano dominated drum bombast - I would give the album five stars...however, Amnesiac further expounds upon something I noted with Kid A...the rare ability to succesfully incorporate orchestral elements into a rock/pop composition, particularly noticeable on the monolithic Dollars &amp; Cents. <br />Like Kid A, this is alot of album. Sometimes it takes a few listens to find exactly what you like about it. With Radiohead, I suspect you will never get exactly what you expect. In time, the band could fall into a trap of unconscious self-parody...but at the moment they are still riding that line for everything it is worth...remaining in my eyes the most exciting act on the popular scene today.
B00003CXDZ|1.0|This attempt at Fellini,3 Stooges,Beatles,Monty Python,etc..was embarrassing to even watch..Maybe if I would have been &quot;totaled&quot; on absinthe a message would have been received,but, not from this movie. Even the photography was bad. If I had rotten fruit I would have thrown it at the screen. &quot;The double hook&quot;..smelled.I asked for my money back..even tho' I had free passes!! A total waste of time..I'll wait for the Crazy Horse or La Barone!!Show it without sound or color and see if it follows Hitchcock's &quot;Rules&quot;....Put the people responsible for this &quot;movie&quot; up against the wall and shoot them with their own shots...and make them doubles!!Use the future DVDs for coasters!!
0671027344|5.0|This book grabbed be on the very first page and held me there. The main character of this book, he puts faith into your heart on society. With each amazement at human nature he describes the naive words of a boy being forced through manhood as he enters the doors of High School.<br />I'd recommend this for anyone entering high school or who wants to re-enter the doors through this book. Aboslutely wonderful.
B00004Z511|5.0|Mind you, I'm no Radiohead fan. I don't like pop. Nor do I watch MTV or have seen any of their music videos. I like DEVO, Frank Zappa, The Residents, XTC, Harry Partch, Sun Ra, Talking heads, Wendy Carlos etc. I hadn't even heard of Radiohead until about a year ago and hadn't listened to any of their albums except for this one. I understand that Radiohead is a British POP band. This music isn't pop(well perhaps avant-pop, but who cares, it's music) and it seems that this band has tried their very best to make good pop records before this and made themselves a complete success. Good move! Now it seems to me that while making good pop music has payed off because their older fans would buy this album. You may not want to take it but, THIS IS A REALLY UNIQUE AND INTELLIGENT, HONEST-TO-GOD, WHOLE CONCEPT-TYPE ALBUM! This music was meant for probably everyone just to hear that they - talented (and now obviously willinmgly creative) show-offs - can really make special music. I'm not saying that this hasn't been done before (The Beatles are a well-known example. They made great pop music before going experimental and getting great results) but never done to this scale. They became so popular and used popularity like real musicians/composers/song writers to make their more creative side heard. I have lots of very interesting albums in my collection but this one is one to be heard by everyone and anyone with ears and an IQ above 41. Buy it or borrow it or something.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Amnesiac is, by far, the best cd I have heard since Kid A.  It combines genious work with poetry and style.  Go listen to it now, or I will be dissapointed.  Thom Yorke's vocals are just amazing.  The Greenwood brother's are both military alumni works of art.  And of course, Phil Selway, creates the most creative beats and fills that fit perfectly with the other appendages.  And obviously, Ed O'brien has kept his good reputation with his inventive bass riffs and everything else.  Radiohead is amazing.  If you don't own all their cd's...go out and get them immediatly.  You will be greatful.  Enjoy.<br />P.S. Amnesiac is a work of art
B00005B36H|5.0|TOOL hits the spot yet again. This time better than ever. They have it all; the 8 minute epics, deep, uncomforting and disturbing sound of rock known only to TOOL. this time is more personal, and it led me to another dimension of music. Song are arranged in an perfect order, where \\"the grudge\\" starts you off with pounding beats, and it leads you on to \\"schism\\" which runs a lot of sounds from \\"aenima\\", to \\"ticks and leeches\\" which unites a lot of best from tool overall. No matter how deep are u in tool music this one will touch you and carry you to where no staind, or limp bizkit, or no other cheeze ball band ever will. I can freeely say that with this 3rd instalment Tool has became the Pink Floyd of the 90's and probably of the 2000 and on. Above realistic is the feeling \\"lateralus\\" will carve in you, os just relax and enjoy a little musical matrix of TOOL!!
B000003C2U|5.0|Chuck Schuldiner's collaboration with members of Cynic and Sadus must have coincided with some kind of strange planetary lineup or something. The first exposure I had to this music left me emotionally drained. I laughed, I cried, I begged a friend to dub me a tape. This is beautiful music that just happens to be death metal. Schuldiner's track record as a leader and innovator has made him the Miles Davis of his genre-- an artist who everyone has worked with or wants to work with.
B00004XOWM|5.0|WHATS UP WIT ALL YOU PEOPLE DISSIN' THE CD? The only thing that is messed up is your brain. This is the best CD put out by Limp Bizkit ever. Yet there is still more to come. And if you want some real music you have found it. This music ain't for wusses this is for people who have good taste and don't cry to the internet cause they thought this was a cooking CD on what to do when your bizkit gets limp.
0876855575|4.0|Every woman should read this book but I suspect few will. Written in the form of an autobiography, which follows the life of Henry (or Hank) who grows up in a poverty stricken home, is an outsider, dreamer, and who develops a truly horrifying case of acne/boils which makes him an object of disgust as well, it is characterised by two outstanding qualities: honesty and clarity. Mr Bukowski eschews the adjective and the adverb and like another great writer of clear English, George Orwell, it is a pleasure to read. As a former boy I can relate to many experiences that young Henry has at school, with gangs, with girls, with teachers, with parents, that seem to be of universal application. The revelation he experiences when he is praised for an &quot;essay&quot; he writes at school on witnessing President Roosevelt visiting, when the essay is a complete fabrication, is  revelatory for the reader too. There are other such moments in this great read. One is when students in Henry's class share a joke with their teacher, and they laugh, and laugh, together; another is the sexual games another teacher plays with them and the boys feel they are truly in love with her, and she with them. There is much HUMANITY in this book. Compassion, sadness and the understanding of what it is to be human in the 20th century in America, is in this book.
B000007MVD|5.0|I've had this CD for more than five years... can anyone tell me what's different about this edition compared with the one Apple released in the mid-90s?  Is it a pure reissue, or is there any modification in the track listing or the sound quality.<br />The version I've got is wonderful.  Hearing the Beatles play together as a band is the primary pleasure of their early recordings, and this is the closest you can get to the sound they made as a foursome, playing dirtyass rock and roll.  Very worthwhile.
B00005AWMF|5.0|&quot;The Best of Sade&quot; collects some great songs from this group. These selections were recorded from 1984 to 1993. But the group's style remains consistent: mellow, jazzy, elegant pop. Vocalist Sade Adu has a distinctive voice: smooth and sensuous. She sounds introspective on some songs, subtly passionate on others. I especially like her slyly playful performance on the opening track, &quot;Your Love Is King.&quot; If you remember the initial releases of these songs, this CD will bring back memories. But even if you're too young to remember Sade's early success, this is still a great, romantic CD.
6301902645|5.0|...that's all it is.  What dialogue was shot is so low in volume that you can't hear a lot of what is said and then the rest is covered up by distance or motors.  BUT, we knew what this movie was about...it's about PORSCHES!  LE MANS!  When racing was racing, when it was about 12-Cylinder Turbo 917s and Ferrari 512s.  :)<br />The &quot;non-racer&quot; Porsche is not as such...it is a racer in a different -- production -- class.  If you listened to the announcer or followed racing, you would knw that they race everything: Corvettes, Lotus, standard 911s, etc.  It was just &quot;slower traffic&quot; as the racing boss says to the team owner when asked of the fate of Number 20 after that crash.
B000001GY9|3.0|Bernstein's Schumann perfomances are ardent and individual -- but then again, that's Lenny for you.  This cycle is certainly preferable to Karajan's Schumann cycle, which is over-thick and stodgy beyond compare.  However, Bernstein is still too thick in some places -- the beginning of the third symphony, and almost throughout the second, for example.  Many of his tempi are agonizingly slow -- the slow movement of the second is perhaps the slowest ever recorded (not to mention excessively sentimental, as if it were some cheap hollywood film score), and the finale of the first could certainly be more animated.  What's more, Bernstein departs from the score in the second symphony, where the dotted rhythm in the all-important fanfare motive (that occurs throughout the work) is evened out to a non-dotted rhythm, robbing much of the work of its sense of struggle and defiance.  If you want to get a Schumann symphony cycle on two CD's for the price of one, consider Masur's fiery yet clear performances on Teldec, recently re-released.  Those of you willing to spend more should definitely acquire Gardiner's incredible three-CD set (in my opinion the best Schumann symphony cycle to date), which also includes the completed movements of the early G minor symphony, BOTH versions of the fourth, as well as the stirring Konzertstck for four horns and orchestra.
0812550706|5.0|Orson Scott Card is an absolute genius, as displayed in this book, along with Ender's Shadow.  Those two books have become my favorite books, and I read them every so often- just pull them off the shelves and read them.  I have heard there is another one about Bean, and look forward to reading it.  Although there are other books in the &quot;Ender Series,&quot; this book and Ender's Shadow, are the best. From the beginning, as a six-year old boy grabs your attention, you can't put the book down.  My copy is worn at the edges, and the pages are dogeared.  I have my favorite passages, and could probably go on forever raving about the book.  Through to the end, it provides intense action and insights into Ender's mind as he plays his &quot;games.&quot;
B000002LGQ|4.0|Madonna's offering to the music world is something that nobody can deny. Generations have grown up with her songs and it wouldn't be too much to say that some of them owe their very own existance to her recordings ( anybody remembers &quot;Papa don't preach&quot; ?... ) . The only arguement that can be done about the whole Madonna phenomenon is about which of her albums is her best one. Personally i believe it's her 1989 release , &quot;Like A Prayer&quot; .This is a record which incudes songs which have the vibe of the old carefree days ( &quot;Cherish&quot; ) next to others whose depth and maturity can only cause admiration ( &quot;Oh Father&quot; ). At the same time she gives lessons on what funk is all about ( &quot;Express Yourself&quot; , &quot;Keep it together&quot; ) while releases one of the most well-crafted pop songs of that year ( &quot;Like A Prayer&quot; ).The ultimate highlight though is definetely &quot;Till Death Do Us Part&quot; a track in which she sounds like she speaks about very familiar ( hmmm ) situations of her real life .It is certaintly one of the best singles about a love-gone-wrong story i ever heard and one of the best ones of her career too. And although we are dealing with sunny pop songs in most of the cases , the lyrics sound honest and geniun from the cheerfull &quot;...burning love , that's the way it's got to be ! &quot; to the touching &quot;...he's not in love with her anymore...&quot; .
6300185311|5.0|I originally watched this movie to see Paul Lynde, and while his performance cracks me up, I came to enjoy this movie for far more than his appearance. Hudson plays the ultimate hypochondriac who learns his lesson after overhearing his doctor talking about another patient's grim prognosis and mistaking it for his own. What follows is what makes this one of my favorite movies.   One of my favorite lines is when Tony Randall(in his continuing inebriation throughtout the movie) asks the bartender at the party &quot;Did you ever REALLY feel a table? Wake up! Wake up! Live your life!&quot; Well, it's just hilarious. I also loved Lynde as the bubbly plot salesman who &quot;likes people&quot;. If you enjoy romance comedies without the profanities and sexual situations a lot of today's movies have, this is one to see if not buy. I never get tired of watching Send Me No Flowers. Hudson, Day, and Randall's other two films together are also worth watching.
B00003Q08R|3.0|Hardly a great LP, MCCARTNEY II is still a lot more interesting than some of the more commercial and sterile studio work he put out in the 1980s and 90s.<br />I've never been able to get past the sped-up vocals on &quot;Coming Up,&quot; but I like the thumping pseudo-billy of &quot;Nobody Knows,&quot; and &quot;Bogey Music.&quot;  The instrumentals, especially &quot;Frozen Jap,&quot; are captivating, and &quot;One Of These Days&quot; is a very un-McCartneyish ballad.
B0000029GA|5.0|this album didnt have the greatest beats, but lets forget about that. Nas has been given a gift. He has the best flow and the best lyrics i have ever heard. He raps about life on the streets, and it feels like your actually on the streets of queensbridge when listening to his lyrics. If your looking for a rap cd to get a party jumping, this is definetly NOT the cd, but if your looking for a rap cd to be able to listen all the way through and relax to, this is the cd. BUY THIS!
B000059PPN|3.0|Despite the snickering warnings of one reviewer, I did purchase the Anchor Bay DVD of this Lucio Fulci celluloid mayhem.  I am not quite sure whether the Anchor Bay edition is the &quot;definitive&quot; uncut version (Sure looks like it) but it does include trailers and biographical info on Fulci and the screenwriter, Dardano Sacchetti.  As for the film itself, I have little to add to what has been said in other reviews, except that one of the suggested descriptions, a &quot;cheapskate version of THE SHINING,&quot; is right on the target.  It even features a scene where the Freudstein crypt overflows with blood.  It IS an effective horror film; there are a decent number of set-pieces that are shocking and audacious, including that &quot;ax-blade coming through the door&quot; sequence.  But there is a general tone of  shoddiness that suffuses a Fulci film like miasma, that unfortunately hinders me from appreciating his works to the fullest.  For me, HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY totally breaks down in the last 20 minutes or so.  It becomes just unbelievably grimy and scuzzy, with puddles of blood and fake body parts everywhere, and I could not help but thinking how uncomfortable it must have been for the actors to endure all this.  The parts I like best are the early scenes that hint at the premonitions of terrible things to come, such as when the boy (Yes, his dubbed voice is truly annoying, like a 40-year-old woman trying to sound like a chirping infant) first notices the little girl in a photograph of the Freudstein mansion, or when the girl sees a vision of how a character is going to die from decapitation.  Once &quot;Dr. Freudstein&quot; shows up for real, dressed in a Mao jacket with huge buttons, it is all downhill from there, to the outright foolish ending, with (how's this for pretension?) an epigram from Henry James!  Ah well, it could have been worse.  I would still prefer HOUSE BY... to many better-known horror films, such as HALLOWEEN or SCREAM.  The best Fulci film I have seen, BTW, is DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING.i film I have seen, BTW, is DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING.
B000003BF4|5.0|This is one of my favorite live albums. I've been listening to it for many years, but I cannot hear 4 guitars as a previous reviewer claims? Does anybody else hear 4 guitars? I'm curious...
B00004SZWD|5.0|There is some music that is so good and so passionate and so ..perfect that one can only theorise that its composer has been momentarily brushed with the paintbrush of genius. Stevie Wonder has been lucky to have been privy to multitude brushstrokes. On this album..this magnum opus...he is at his best. There is no such thing as a filler on this album and every song says something important...every word is meaningful, every instrument augments the message. From straight pop to well crafted R &amp; B, songs of unconditional love to lost love to obsessive love; social commentaries to simple melodies- this album has it all. No music collection is complete without this on the second shelf, poised in the centre of the wall of cds, for easy reach.
B00003CXE7|1.0|In an interview prior to this film's release, Russell Crowe disclosed that when asked to read the script he found it to be only '70%' complete - a friend of his advised him to do the film anyway, on the strength of Ridley Scott's past record.  Some 8 months later, with the shooting about to begin, Crowe looked at the script again, and much of it had been discarded, leaving only about 30% intact.  Somewhat apprehensive, Crowe took his concerns to Scott, who consoled him with a confident, 'We'll make it up as we go along', or words to that effect.       This attitude betrays the cynicism with which Hollywood treats its own products and, in particular, its screenwriters.  If the budget allocated for, say, the rather fake looking CGI tigers had been allocated to script development, then (who knows) a good movie might have been created.  Instead we have this.       The deficiencies of story not withstanding, it was surpising to see the film fail on many technical levels.  Firstly, the editing deserves to be singled out for special condemnation.  Clumsy abrupt cuts, gratuitous effects, poorly compiled battle and fight sequences: the list could be extended.  Secondly, the short cuts required to computer generate a colloseum (only some 30 degrees of the entire 360 were rendered, the illusion created by repeating this segment) see a distanced (and surprisingly small) crowd of Roman onlookers - the gladiatoral 'spectacle' seems less exciting than your typical weekend football game, the arena itself often appearing artificial and quite 'empty'.  Thirdly,...well what is the point of going on...      While George Lucas and Speilberg at least try to learn from masters such as Kurosawa, Scott appears happy draw upon his earlier experience in television advertising - and, hey, we all know advertising works, it's often clever and entertaining, it's lots of things, but it's just not great cinema.
6305313687|4.0|Not long ago I told a friend to see this disturbing but well made film, and he said, \\"I think I should watch the first nine parts first.\\" This is what happens when your communications are reduced to computers. If I were talking to him verbally I could say, \\"American History ex...\\" but written it looks like American History 10. So be it. We eventually straightened it out. It is just one great film, not a ten part documentary series by Ken Burns. This film may touch you on many levels. It will make you examine your own feelings on race. It may make you confront the idea that has been put forth that we are all racists on some level. Naturally we don't take our racial feelings to extremes like the characters in this film do, but on some level we can see and understand and trace the roots of where our racial feelings come from. When I was a baby I played with a little neighbour girl who was black. We were not even a year old, and we obviously did not care what colour we were. And we did not care about this until we got older and had ideas put into our heads by our families, our surroundings, our environment and our experiences. We might think we do not care, but we do. In the film, Derek (a shocking and excellent Edward Norton) goes to prison for murdering two black boys who have come to his house and attempted to steal his truck. Derek is a violently racist, white supremacist who has tattoos of swastikas and \\"white power\\" emblazoned all over his body. The film, through the eyes of Derek's younger brother (played by Edward Furlong), illustrates not just racism but how that racism began (with their late father's tirade on the evils of affirmative action and against reading black literature in school, and of course with their father-who was a police officer-losing his life in the line of duty). All of these events and others shaped who Derek grew up to be. Naturally he resented and hated someone for taking his father from him, and all the evidence in his mind pointed to \\"otherness\\"... to blacks, to Jews, to anyone he could think in his pain and bitterness to blame. The turning point of the film comes when Derek murders the two black kids in the street in front of his house. The terrifying look on his face as he stands in the middle of the road and surrenders to the police is startling (who would have thought Edward Norton capable of that? Well, I suppose if you saw Primal Fear you know he is a superb actor). Derek goes to prison (prison scenes are filmed in black and white for a contrast) and starts to see things from a totally different angle and he comes out of prison a changed man, but by then his prior actions have changed the lives of his entire family and most of all for his younger brother whom he tries to save from having the same fate as he did. All the actors here are excellent, Norton being the most brilliant, to Beverly D'Angelo and the scary Fairuza Balk as Derek's psycho girlfriend Stacy. The ending is not at all happy, but it is about what you would expect from such an unforgiving and real look at unhappy circumstances and ills of society.
006092988X|5.0|It's no wonder that this book is truly loved by practically everyone who reads it: it's a story of growing up and innocence, life and love, caring and the way things go. You might not have a lot of money, but you can do one thing that's free, and that's to love.   Francie Nolan is inside of all of us, the eleven year old girl who has her life set out for her: flowers in a brown bowl, read a book every day in alphabetical order until you reach the Z's, have a lot of children. She wants to win everything on a board that she spends a bit at every Saturday; right down to the skates and the doll with real hair: she yearns for what she may never get. Her family is poor and lives in the tenements of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. She and her brother Neeley do not know to be ashamed of their father and Francie has scant knowledge that her father has a bad reputation. Her mother works hard and her aunt &quot;gets around&quot;, as the writer calls it. She may be poor, but she has a loving family. She wants to be an author when she grows up and pay attention to children; she is upset with the librarian at the Brooklyn library who does not even look up at the poor little girl who comes in every day to check out a book that is good for an eleven year old. Francie is pleased when a book she loves is chosen; she symbolizes an everyday, American girl.  We grow up with Francie; book one chronicles the life of an eleven year old girl that is so everyday, repetitive, that it shows everything is all right. The customs and the traditions prove that Francie's life has a rhythm to it, nothing bad happens. Book two chronicles life early on, as her parents meet and have their children and Francie grows older as things happen. And book three proves that you must grow up, as Francie enters college and begins a new life that only the reader can imagine what happens next.   So read this book. Just read it, and you'll be glad you did.
6305066345|2.0|...He Got Game was not quite as good as I thought it should be. Denzel Washington was superb as always, as the jailed father of a basketball player, who is allowed out of jail to help convince his semi-estranged son to attend a certain university. Washington is convincing. His sexual escapades with the relatively untalented Milla Jovovich are not all that believable, although I guess if I had been in prison for so long I might consider Jovovich also. The real life basketball player who plays the basketball star who has to choose his path is all right. He is no actor, though, and his path to decisionmaking is pretty long and boring and there is just a bit too much sex in it. His conniving girlfriend Lala is trying to make him turn pro and is seeing agents on the side. She also has no qualms about not being loyal to him. Misdirected misfire, this film. It is a shame, but it did serve my immediate purposes.
1572522089|5.0|This is one of those films that I HAVE to see once a year or two. Basically, Ran (translates into Chaos) is the Japanese version of Shakespeare's King Lear. Never read King Lear? Don't worry, I haven't either and I still love this film. I'll admit that this movie can be slow at times, but the rest of the movie makes up for that. ESPECIALLY the two battle scenes. The first one is really good because it is SILENT. Your ears don't hear the sounds of swords clashing, arrows whizzing, people screaming, etc; but your mind hears. There is, however, music playing during that battle and it conforms so PERFECTLY with the battle. Then, best of all, is how Kurosawa BREAKS the silence.  Between battles, some of the interesting characters are this silly little man who tries to cheer up his elderly liege and, finally, a woman who will draw a knife on you one second and try and make love to you the next. Then there's a part about a fox-head that was really funny.  The last battle utilizes muskets more than swords, but it's still good. Oh, then there's the beheading. No, you don't see the head fall off, but you do see the wall get wet with blood. It's the graphic parts like this that make it rated R. If you've never seen a Kurosawa movie, this is a good place to start. Also try Sanjuro, Yojimbo, and The Seven Samurai by the same director. Just about all of his movies are officially 4 stars.
B00003CWN2|4.0|Quite a sad tale of gender and identity conflict and how one person's quest to find herself (himself) leads to his own demise. Who knew that Hilary Swank was capable of this caliber acting? Seeing her in Beverly Hills, 90210 and even worse in Karate Kid 4 or something like that certainly would not have prepared anyone for this level of drama. Naturally it put Swank, the Oscar winner for best actress in 2000, on Hollywood's A-list. It was interesting also to see Lecy (does she do by Alicia now?)  Goranson of Roseanne fame in a role here since she has not much been seen since Roseanne days. Also Chloe Sevigny gives a stellar performance as the girlfriend of Swank's character (Brandon Teena). The truly sad part of this film, apart from the complete discrimination and fear people show of things they do not understand, is that the story is true and Brandon Teena ended up murdered in reality. Truly a tragic tale.
B00003CXSP|1.0|Anthony Hopkins must have wanted the paycheck because this film absolutely stinks.It has the plot and story of a grade z mad slasher film.Don't waste your time or money,as I did.The worst film of 2001 thus far.
B00003CWRX|4.0|Russell Crowe is a talented and chameleonic actor. He can disappear into his roles, which is probably one of the most difficult things an actor can do. So many actors are easily typecast because they just cannot disappear, but in The Insider Crowe disappears into the role of a middle-aged American tobacco company executive living in the suburbs. The character gives up everything he has to be a whistleblower about the damaging effects of cigarettes on health. Crowe was amazing in this role and should have taken home an Oscar for his performance. This said, I am not one of the fawning sort of fans who thinks of Crowe as a sex symbol. I don' t really see the appeal toward that at all. This role is a good example of how he is so much more than that. The film is astounding and as often is the case all the more astounding because it is true. Al Pacino is his passionate and effective self as the producer who convinced Crowe's character to come forward and reveal these tobacco-industry secrets. Pacino's character fights the good fight for Crowe, but it never quite works out perfectly or happily. This is one of the truly remarkable elements of a film like this. It tells a story and tells it brilliantly without overmoralizing anything. Without beating the viewers over the head with anything. Without trying to wrap the story up into a neat little happy ending package. In real life, things end with loose ends untied, and this story shows that sometimes good does not ultimately triumph over bad. It may have small victories all along the way, but in moral warfare-indeed any kind of warfare-there will be a series of battles, some small and some large, and there are wins and losses all along the way.
B000002UV9|5.0|Geoff Tate proves once again that his voice surpasses those of other artists.  DeGarmo shows the endless versatility of his style.  Though Silent Lucidity gets the most &quot;public&quot; attention, The Thin Line, Jet City Woman, and Another Rainy Night are tracks that will keep you popping this one in the player.  Anybody Listening is one of the more overlooked tracks, which is sad.  The bass lines are outstanding, the vocals are haunting. This track will always remain one of my favorites.
6302994063|4.0|Strictly Ballroom is a truly excellent film. Funny, farcical and heartwarming. However, the first time you sit down to watch this quirky, loud Australian comedy, you may not be prepared and may not even like it at first. It is a farce but when it begins, if you don't know what to expect, you might be taken aback by the mock documentary style it adopts, but when you start to see how fanatical the main character Scott's parents are, you will soon begin to see the charm of this virtually unheard of (in America) film. Truly hilarious tale of learning, friendship and one of the classic \\"ugly duckling turned beautiful swan\\" stories that remind us that there is a lot more than meets the eye. Lovely debut from director Baz Luhrmann (Romeo and Juliet and Moulin Rouge).
014100018X|5.0|What a fun and mischievous book!  If you have seen the movie, you will be surprised by the book.  The character of the priest is so much more interesting in the book.  If you like stories that are a little bit irreverent, you will enjoy this one :-)
B00004Z459|5.0|I really believe  thin album in awsome.  The lyrics are great, the beats an rythms too.  The 12 songs af the album are exellent, I cant choose only 1 favourite song, however I can say I love Papercut, One step Closer, Points of authority, Crawling and In the end (please listen to the piano!!).  Linkin Park is not one more new rock band, It's the best new rock band out there.
B000002A3T|5.0|Seven years and change have passed since its release, and this work of art seems even more moving, melodic, introspective, haunting, and enchanting than when it debuted.  Of their impressive anthology of works, I find myself listening to, and enjoying, this album more than any other. Is there a more enjoyable, listenable PF album (save, possibly, DSOTM) from top to bottom than Division Bell?  The orchestration is marvellous.  &quot;Poles Apart&quot; is a musical and lyrical pleasure, &quot;Marooned&quot; transports you to a distant locale, and &quot;Coming Back to Life&quot; has what some may call true &quot;wailability,&quot; inside or outside of the shower.  Even my eight-year-old, Brittany-Speared daughter loves this release, enthusiastically belting out the chorus to &quot;What Do You Want From Me?&quot;   Let Division Bell stand alone in its critical review, free of past works, quarrels, and critiques.  Had this been the first and only PF release, what then would critics say?<br />Thank you, David, Rick, and Nick, for your fabulous gem which has enriched my life and so many others. <br />Is there enough in the tank for one more studio release?
B000002LFZ|5.0|How could anyone not enjoy this 16 song collection of some of Fleetwood Macs' greatest songs?  Noting that it starts with the Nicks/Buckingham period until the nineties, every song is a gem.  Included are some lesser known tracks like, &quot;No Questions Asked&quot; and &quot;Little Lies&quot; along with the perennial favorites.  I surprised to learn that with all these fantastic hits, only &quot;Dreams&quot; made it to #1 on the Billboard charts, noting that Stevie Nicks had written the lyrics pre-Fleetwood Mac days.  Stephen Davis includes some nice liner notes.<br />If this set does not satisfy you, obtain the four disc set called, &quot;The Chain&quot;.  That collection includes a full disc of early Fleetwood Mac material from the late sixties/early seventies to the present.  Regardless, this CD is a reflection of rockin' songs we all grew up with.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|If you like musicals, fantasies and romantic dramas, you'll go nuts for Moulin Rouge. With unique camera action, wierd, wacky and wonderful sets, delightfully surprising musical adaptations and more than a touch of the fantastic, Moulin Rouge is sure to please. McGregor's performance, both dramatic and vocal, is to die for. How can one person be so shamelessly multi-talented?<br />Kidman does an excellent job as the courtesan &quot;Satine&quot;. Though her singing did not have the &quot;wow&quot; factor of McGregor's, it was more than adequate for the task. And many of the hopeless love songs she performed seemed quite touching when one recalls her present situation in real life.<br />If you don't like musicals, see Moulin Rouge anyway. You'll be treated to a film that doesn't fit the usual, ho-hum summer offerings. Instead it provides a rare treat for the jaded and bored movie goer.
078401020X|4.0|i cant belive how many people are puzzled as to who the murderer is. the film is a study of catherine tremells vengence on jean triplehorns character... as verhoven explains at the end of the directors cut, tremell was probobly rejected at college by jean triplehorn.. and manipulating michael douglas to kill her is her ultimate revenge...
B000002HRE|4.0|This CD contains some of metallica's best songs, some of their most passionate, some of their heaviest metal songs.  Great CD.  I'd say this CD contains at least 4 great songs.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney Spears' &quot;Oops!...I Did It Again&quot; album may be over one year old, but it is still supplying the world with pop hits. The latest single, &quot;Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know,&quot; debuted at number one on MTV's Total Request Live. The critically acclaimed ballad shows a much more mature Spears - as does the rest of this excellent album. &quot;Oops!...I Did It Again&quot; also supplies the record breaking title track, the TRL and radio smash &quot;Lucky&quot; and the empowerment anthem &quot;Stronger.&quot; Among those singles are very strong album tracks including Britney's R&amp;B cover of the Rolling Stone's &quot;(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction,&quot; the ode to individuality, &quot;What U See (Is What U Get),&quot; and the Spears penned &quot;Dear Diary.&quot; There is not a weak song on this 12 track LP. Look for Britney in her new movie &quot;What Friends Are For&quot; and her new album, tentatively titled &quot;Shock Your Mind&quot; due out in November.
B00005B4GU|4.0|If you were a diehard Radiohead fan, you would already have this album and you wouldn't be reading these reviews to help you decide whether you should buy it.  So you might be thinking: &quot;I liked 'OK Computer' a lot, and I heard that this one is more like 'OK' than 'Kid A'.  Well you'd be partly right there.  'Amnesiac' sounds like it should have been the album between 'OK' and 'Kid A'.  Maybe you loved 'Kid A' and wonder if 'Amnesiac' will be anything like it.  Yes, some of the same elements are still there.  But I think the best way to approach this album (as well as with any new album by a band you like) is to keep an open mind, free of expectations.  I've read a few reviews that say how if this wasn't 'Radiohead' nobody would like it.  That's not true; there would be plenty of people that would like it, they just might not know about it if it didn't have the popularity of the name 'Radiohead'.  These guys have talent, we already know that; and I have a suspicion that they make their music more for themselves than for the public.  They're not trying to produce hits; they're just expressing themselves the way they know how.   If you liked the soundscapes of 'Kid A' *and* the quirky melodies of 'OK Computer' then this album is for you.  If you're expecting something better than the masterpiece that is 'Kid A', you'll probably be disappointed. If you can put all other 'Radiohead' albums out of your mind and listen to this as if it were a brand new band, you'll find it very enjoyable.
0790743507|5.0|An exhilerating and fast-moving musical comedy, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is one of MGM's best-loved musicals.<br />Directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN tells the hilarious story of what happened when Hollywood exploded with the advent of sound pictures (&quot;Talkies&quot;).<br />Jean Hagen won high praise for her riotous performance as Lina Lamont, silent screen queen with the killer looks and a voice like sulphuric acid!  Her voice is the main drawback for the bigwig studio producer (Millard Mitchell).  Enter Kathy Seldon (Debbie Reynolds) who offers to dub Lina's dialogue and singing to save the studio from ruin.<br />Along the way Kathy falls for dashing leading man Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and cavorts with his energetic best friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor).<br />With the songs &quot;Fit As A Fiddle&quot;, &quot;You Were Meant For Me&quot;, &quot;Would You?&quot;, &quot;Broadway Melody&quot;, &quot;Good Mornin'&quot;, and the show-stopping Title Song.<br />Interestingly enough, the voice you hear when Kathy is dubbing the song for Lina, &quot;Would You?&quot;, is actually Jean Hagen singing, NOT Debbie Reynolds!
B000005S0D|5.0|Una expresin mayor del rock clsico. A mi entender este lbum es el mejor de esta banda. Es imperdible, desde el primero hasta el ltimo de sus temas. Oir este cd es verdaderamente placentero. Es un clsico que permanecer por siempre vigente.
B00005BL2A|5.0|The boys from the UK have returned with what is perhaps their greatest work.  Exciter has the same draw to it as 1990's Violator.  Infectious slow tunes like &quot;When The Body Speaks&quot; and &quot;Freelove&quot; show that singer Dave Gahan took this album beyond seriously as his range is incredible.  Other songs leave you begging for more.  &quot;Dead Of Night&quot; pounds in your ear with it's stomping pulse beat and hard lyrics from Martin Gore.  Other notables are &quot;Dream On&quot;, &quot;Shine&quot;(mixed beats and groove), and &quot;Comatose&quot;; which has a similarity to 1990's &quot;Blue Dress&quot;.  All in all, Depeche Mode show no signs of rust after a long lay off.  A must have for any music fan.
B00004U45G|5.0|Jimmy Page playing subpar can still play rings around a lot of other guitar players, and he's anything BUT subpar on this terrific live CD. I managed to go through most of the 90s almost completely oblivious to the Black Crowes, so I didn't really know what to expect, though I hoped Chris Robinson wasn't going to try and shamelessly copy Robert Plant the way David Coverdale did on his 1993 team-up with Page. Well, this pairing works great! The Led Zep covers may mostly stick to the originals, but they cook partly because Robinson sings his ... off without much more than a cursory nod to Plant's stylizations. They also work because the rest of the band back the two frontmen to the hilt, and because these covers are counterbalanced by other covers, including great versions of B.B King's \\"Woke Up This Morning,\\" the old Yardbirds/Jeff Beck cruncher, \\"Shapes Of Things,\\" and, whodathunk, Peter Green's \\"Oh Well, Part 1.\\"  Of the Zep stuff, \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine,\\" \\"In My Time Of Dying\\" and \\"Custard Pie\\" particularly stand out, but everything here has something that keeps you glued to the CD player. Try this; it's a smoker!
B00005B4GU|4.0|Although i appreciate and enjoy the goal of making 'art for art's sake,' this disc crosses the line every once in a while, becoming so abstract that it makes it less enjoyable.  Luckily, these moments are balanced by songs hinting at a return to the somber, deep, guitar-driven songs that made us all love OK Computer.  Here's a quick recap of an album that's sometimes brilliant (especially the first half!), sometimes obtuse, but always 100% radiohead. PACKED LIKE SARDINES:  9/10, a great opener propelled along by a kettle drum and a strong beat.  Yorke does a perfect job of singing to set that somber, defeated tone, telling us &quot;I'm a reasonable man, get off my case.&quot; PYRAMID SONG:  10/10, pretty much a flawless song.  It has a stark beauty in its lyrics, and the jazzy drumming really augments the power behind the simple piano playing.   PULK/PULL:  6/10, weird name, weird song.  Some neat stripped-down electronica effects, especially when the music dissolves into periods of arcade type sounds.  But it meanders a bit, and I think that the heavily distorted vocals work against the song. YOU AND WHOSE ARMY?:  10/10, simply breath-taking, especially as the organ and strings first kicks in (at that point it really reminds me of some of the music from Shawshank Redemption).  Its one of those songs that makes you stop what you're doing and listen. I MIGHT BE WRONG:  9/10, a great song with a great (gasp!) guitar riff.  The highlight is the ending as the main guitar cuts out to a mild beat, which gives way to a more delicate guitar.  Really well done. KNIVES OUT:  8/10, for a second as this first started, it brought back memories of the beginning of Paranoid Android, and this turns out to be the song most like those on OK Computer/The Bends.  MORNING BELL:  3/10,  a pretty lame take on what used to be an excellent song on Kid A.  Its darker and has less clarity.  Maybe it deserves higher than a 3, but I hate re-mixes that don't help the song.  DOLLARS &amp; SENSE:9/10, musically similar to Kid A's material, this song is blessed with some classic radiohead-isms.  Yorke whispers &quot;We're going to crack your little souls&quot; (a la the &quot;we hope that you choke&quot; part in Exit Music).  The music from the orchestra gives the song an intense feeling.   HUNTING BEARS:  7/10,  nothing much here, just a lonely guitar playing for 2 minutes.  Serves its purpose of making the transition to the more introspective songs to follow very well however. LIKE SPINNING PLATES:  7/10,  has a very neat sound that I can't describe.  Again, Yorke's weird (almost drunken) vocals are annoying at the beginning.  The lyrical simile of the spinning plates and his talking of &quot;floating bodies&quot; all complement the song's music nicely though.   LIFE IN A GLASS HOUSE:  4/10,  very interesting song.  I like how someone described it as a Dixieland Death-march.  But nothing prior prepares us for this strange shift in musical direction and it seems out of place (especially since it ends the album).
B00005B238|5.0|This is without question one of my all time favorite Arnold movies. This movie has it all. Arnold leads a group of commandos into the jungle to locate some kidnapped Americans. He and his troops find everyone slaughtered. The monster then begins on Arnold and the commandos. This is one of the most sinister killing machines you will ever see in a movie. The action is nonstop.You will also have to brag on the scenery in this movie as well. It definitely is eyecatching. The stars are also top notch. The movie will keep you on the edge of your seat. The big question is,will Arnold be able to handle the killing machine from outer space? Watch this video,you will be greatly entertained.
0783219172|3.0|Fox likely made this movie to break away from his perpetual billing as the guy next door, but it is difficult to picture him as the shifty Frank Banister, and some of the dialog sounds really canned.<br />The sequence of the film itself takes me back to my childhood when i was on some very strong anti-epileptic medication, that although legally prescribed and adminstered, produced some very bizzare and trippy visual effects. Thus, it was not particularly enjoyable to watch and the plot did not make any sense.<br />The movie would have been good as a comedy or drama, but Fox cannot pull off horror movies as the perpetrator. Through out the movie, the usually great actor looks like he is out of his element and rethinking the decision to star in this vehicle.<br />I like weird stuff as much as the next freak, and would normally enjoy this movie, but I can't when the lead actor himself does not look like he is having a good time during the filming.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|This movie is awsome.. i've seen it 3 times in theaters and am willing to go see it many many more times. I can't wait for it's release.. if you like Magical Realism then this movie is for you... plus if your a big Ewan or Nicole fan they both did outstanding jobs in this film. They are Definatly up for Best Actor and best actress....
B00005BJ2O|5.0|As soon as I saw the first preview for this movie at the movie theaters, I wanted the soundtrack.  So, I got it the very day it was released, and I really have enjoyed it.  This soundtrack accompanies the movie very well.  Though the song Nature Boy by David Bowie is rather slow it is still good.  Lady Marmalade performed by Lil' Kim, Christina, Pink, and Mya, is a good cover of the original, though I don't really like the rap part of the song, it still goes together well.  One of my favorite songs on this CD is Fatboy Slim's Because We Can, it is a techno rendition of the can-can, and is very fast.  I really enjoyed the cover of David Bowie's Diamond Dog's by Beck, it's a much slower version, but is still good.  The interesting thing about the CD is that it's split pretty much in half, half the songs being by artists, and then the other half from the movie.  The movie songs are also very good, they are some of the more notable one's from the movie, though not all, and it's interesting to see how many songs by other artists are mixed into each song.  Everything from Heroes by David Bowie to Material Girl by Madonna.  The only bad thing is that if you've seen the movie then you know what songs are missing on this soundtrack.  Hopefully they are planning on releasing a volume 2, or something, with the score, mixes of songs, and some other in movie songs, because there are some I would like to have.
B00005IBGQ|4.0|I first heard Rufus Wainwright on the radio singing Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk, and I knew I had to have that recording.  I love that song and I really love the poetry and originality of Wainwright's lyrics.  He creates moods and searing images.  The background instrumentalization is wonderful and experimental at times, and I like the vocal harmonies. I do agree with the review that there is a certain melodic sameness with many of the songs; but, other customer reviews confirmed what I felt must be true, that this is an album that burns gently into your soul after several listenings.  Plus, he has a resonant and malleable voice that sinuously maintains its integrity in different vocal ranges.
B000002H72|5.0|First album of their's I heard, still my favorita. The sound of music, Boston style, brought to you by the magical pipes of Blackie and Kimmy, the politically acceptable Sonny and Cher for today's Pepsi generation. I loved this band to death, as they so eagerly requested. I mean I like some of the imitators, but only Nirvana truly forged a career out of it, to a degree, lyrically more than musically of course. This bone chilling piece of cerebral razor candy is as good as any of your Limping Cookie stuff young man, now kindly put your sister's hat back in her closet. Yep, it's that good. If pushed, I would definitely say that this album was Zeppelin 4 for the Pixies. Or was it 5. Anyhoo, (isn't it fun to say that?) I really really like this band a lot and I hope everyone goes out and buys all of their records and pillowcases and stuff so they can be famous and on T.V.

B00000DC10|5.0|Loud, fast, smart, and powerfull.  Just what punk isn't anymore with bands like Blink 182, NOFX (though I do like them), and MXPX.  Denis writes some incredibly powerful songs and screams his head off when he gets to \\"singing\\" them.  From the opening lines of \\"I've get a bone to pick with capitalism, and a few to break\\" you will get the intensity of the album.  It's just too bad they broke up, they could've brought punk back to what it was supposed to be....<br />Refused not only brings extremly heavy guitars to the fold, but fuses in some jazz elements and some techno.  Just when the opening song is about to break into another level of chaos in come some Industrial esq. sound effects that last into Liberation Frequency (imo the best song on the album).  The single New Noise is the perfect choice it's just too bad you won't be hearing it on the radio. I think it might make pop punkers brains go pop!
B0000508U6|5.0|Well just yesterday I heard the song &quot;Yellow&quot; on SNL instantly I fell in love with this band/song. I can't tell you about the cd since I myself have yet to listen to it but believe me when I tell you that tomorrow it'll be in my hands!! I read the other reviews and it's even the more reason to get the cd....hope you enjoyed/ will enjoy it as much as I am sure I will!!!
B00005B36H|5.0|Personally I hated AEnima (I wish I knew who to do the AE thingy..) and loved Undertow.  I just wanted to say that incase you are wondering where I'm coming from with this review.  This album is very well written lyrically.  The Grudge, Schism, and Reflection all have some of the best lyrics I've ever heard.  And the bass lines are all very impressive.  The one thing is that this album doesn't really have one song that stands out as a single.  I like that in an album though, it makes you look at the album as a whole instead of 1 or 2 songs that are &quot;awesome&quot;.  Radiohead's Kid A was like that, and IMO it was the best album of last year.  <br />The BS tracks Eon Blue Apacholypse, Mantra, and Fiaop Di Oid (I can't think of how it's spelled at the moment forgive me) are all actually pretty cool.  And both Eon Blue Apacholypse and Mantra flow very well into their succesors The Patient and Schism.  <br />I can't really give you a favorite song at the moment but The Grudge, The Patient, Parabol/Parabola, and Ticks and Leeches are all great epics.  But don't forget Lateralis and Reflextion.  They are great songs too.
B000002UYZ|4.0|Many view this earlier volume of the two-part Beatles collection as a mere warm-up to its more serious and arguably superior successor (1967-1970, a.k.a. &quot;The Blue Album&quot;).  Still, 1962-1966 is an extremely tight set which traces the Fab Four's amazing evolution from their commercial roots to their first real musical experiments.<br />Disc One is comprised mostly of the catchy tunes that instantly made The Beatles the objects of so many screaming fans' obsessions.  Popular singles like &quot;Love Me Do,&quot; &quot;She Loves You,&quot; and &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; propel the enjoyable, if all too brief, hit list along almost seamlessly.  A minor glitch in this disc is that the attempted chronological order is somewhat botched, although only the most discerning fans would notice (or care).  For the order to be correct, tracks 5 and 6 should be switched, since &quot;All My Loving&quot; was part of the group's second album, and &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; was a non-album single released a week later.  Similarly, tracks 10 and 11 should be switched, since &quot;I Feel Fine&quot; was a non-album single released in November '64, and &quot;Eight Days a Week&quot; was part of the group's fourth album, released the following month.<br />The choice of &quot;Yesterday&quot; as the final track on Disc One perfectly foreshadows the more ambitious musical efforts characterizing Disc Two.  By its third track, this second half of the set launches into the post-Help! singles (&quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; and &quot;Day Tripper&quot;) which paved the way for the albums that would truly set The Beatles apart--that is, at least before the legendary Sgt. Pepper's came along.  Unfortunately, the glaring problem on Disc Two is much more significant than the mere chronological oversights on Disc One:  If Rubber Soul, their initial groundbreaking record of 1965, warranted six songs here, how on earth could Revolver, which comes close to approaching the pinnacle oftheir musical diversity, merit only two???  There is a sad imbalance here, even if simply in the neglect of more popular standards like &quot;Good Day Sunshine&quot; or &quot;Got to Get You Into My Life.&quot;  (Never mind such solid fan favorites as the wildly eclectic &quot;Tomorrow Never Comes.&quot;)<br />All in all, despite any flaws, &quot;The Red Album&quot; is an extremely listenable collection that pays proper homage to a band who so defined its generation.  Certainly this portrait of post-adolescent fame is a wonderful prelude to its necessary companion piece from the later years--the subsequent portrait of artistry, exploration, and ego (depicted on 1967-1970) that showcases both The Beatles' highest peak and their tragic denouement.
B00001U0DP|5.0|I personally enjoyed this movie a lot.  Benigni is so incredibly smooth that any guy who watches him would probably want to take notes.  Benigni's character of Guido is set so far beyond superficial.  Throughout the entire movie he kept the same optimistic and charming character despite the background of being placed in a concentration camp.  He goes above and beyond the role of &quot;superdad&quot; which makes this movie even more touching.  He is a miracle worker who shows you that &quot;Life is Beautiful.&quot;
B000002MUQ|3.0|To be honest, I like, but have never been crazy about Van Hagar. Roth all the way! Anyhow, this album is a schitzophrenic mix of great tunes.First, the good stuff. \\"Seventh Seal\\" is a great rocker, with a killer riff that recalls \\"Poundcake\\". \\"Amsterdam\\" is one of the best tunes on the album despite it's utterly cheesy lyrics. It reminds me of something from \\"1984\\", with a fierce solo, one of Eddie's best in years. \\"Aftershock\\", and \\"Baletherium\\" are classic VH. \\"Can't Stop Loving You\\" is pure cheese. This is VH? \\"Don't Tell Me\\" is strong, but Sammy sounds like he's losing his voice trying to screech and scream. \\"Big Fat Money\\" is not great and Sammy sounds even worse on this. \\"Not Enough\\" is the worst song this band has ever recorded. \\"Feelin\\" rocks, but it doesn't sound like VH. It sounds like VH trying to do a sophistocated version of \\"Kashmiere\\". Eddie just can't write like he used to. Bring back Dave!
6303314015|5.0|I think that this is one of the best ever Walt Disney Animated Classics ever made! The music and the songs really touch you and it gives you a new aspect on the circle of life. I think that the way you order is quite well explained but I am in Europe and I have this question: Is this available in PAL Version? Or is it only available in NTSC like I read on the page?
0345441184|5.0|Told from the perspective of a woman living during the rein of King Arthur, The Mists of Avalon is a compelling fantasy story that immediatly enthrals the reader.  The story chronicals the fall of the magical and sensatious world of Avalon to the pagan world of the church through the majestic ruler of Avalon, Morgain.  Bradley writes the infamous tale with incredible genious and superb command for the language.  Her tale will difinitivly withstand the test of time as one of the greatest fantasies ever written.
B00003CXPD|5.0|This was one of the most touching movies I have seen for a log time. Most of the reviews concentrate on the theme of the young boy wanting to dance and escape the daily boredom of a small village in England. Young Jamie Bell is a natural. He really is the young boy, perfectly normal who only has a bit of an unusual hobby. That alone would have made this an exxcellent movie.<br />The second theme, much more under-emphasized is the sheer desparation in a small English miners village, where the effects of the Tatcher government is taking it's toll. The mine is going to get closed and all the villagers are out of work with no chance at all on alternative employment. This drives a probaly perfectly harmonious community to take sides against each other which can only be separated by the police. <br />Gary Lewis, to me, is the star of this movie ( why not nominated for an Oscar) as he embodies the worries; the allegiance to his brothers in arms and the concern for his family. It is heartbraking to see when he finally makes his choice and breaks the picket; It shows a man who is driven to sheer desparation and defying all he believed in in order to help realize his son'dream.<br />This is cinema non plus ultra!
B000007MVD|5.0|Let's put it this way. When I refurbished my sound system a year ago, this was the first (on cassette) to be played.<br />Raw and real. The real deal. One take...warts and all.
6305014140|5.0|To summarize up Ninja Scroll in a few words, simply brilliant.  This is one of the anime films that have gone down as one of the masterpieces that defines what anime is.  Ninja Scroll has a wonderfully diverse cast of characters, a great storyline and knuckle-biting action.  This is not as over-the-top as most anime films, but you can not call yourself a fan of Japanese animation unless you own this film.
0792156684|3.0|I was really looking forward to this movie. The story of the Titanic had always fascinated me, so when I heard that James Cameron was making a movie about it, I expected a real treat. Now this was not a horrible movie, I enjoyed it, but the first half is a complete crock of pure fantasy. The love story is idiotic, because a first class woman and a third class man would never be allowed to meet, and she would not allow herself to see him again if for some reason they accidentally met. The first half was a waste of my precious time and I was bored stiff. All I could think was how could anybody think that this would be remotely possible. But that aside, the last hour and a half are fantastic. When the ship begins sinking, the brilliant effects kick in, and we are treated to a horrifying sight as the ship slowly sinks into the icy waters of the Atlantic. So if you are going to see &quot;Titanic,&quot; skip the the moronic love story and watch the real attraction, the actual sinking.
B00005B4GU|5.0|It's hard to believe these guys can get any better, but they've done it again with Amnesiac:  10x's better than Kid A and on-par with OK Computer.  Incredible!
B00001U0E1|5.0|While conventional thoughts might lead you to believe that a film directed by John Madden and starring Gwyneth Paltrow would be a very serious dramatic production, let me disregard you of that notion right now. &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; is a smart comedy as well as a drama. It brilliantly balances the two genre's into one entertaining film and we get to see a fabulous Oscar winning performance by Paltrow. Joseph Fiennes also gives a memorable performance, even though he was snubbed at the Osacars. Paltrow looks more glamorous than ever before, and the film is a smart and funny tribute to the greates playwrite that ever lived.
0440219078|5.0|....The Giver by Lois Lowry has got to be THE best book that i have ever read.  it was one of those school books and i thought that it would be yet another boring book from school.  boy was i wrong.  i read the book in about 1 day.  its one of those books that u can't put down.  I didn't rate the book a 5 star for nothing!  this is a must read.  you have to get it!
B000002A33|4.0|This album is great. Screaming Trees was great. Why did they never become megastars? It's a mystery.
0060987464|4.0|Being a Marilyn Manson fan, I expected this book to be great. I got much more than great. It was very addictive, I couldn't put it down! Manson starts off in his school years (when he was still known as Brian) and keeps going until the Antichrist Superstar days. He tells all the details about getting high, trouble within the band, his religious beliefs, and his girlfriend getting their child aborted. A must read for fans and recommended for people skeptical of him.
B00005B4GU|5.0|give this record about three listens and you will be won over by its genius...unless you happen to like top 40. If you do, you are the weakest link, goodbye!
B00000348D|5.0|This is a magnificent CD. It contains music made by a group of some of the best minds in Jazz: Ornette Coleman, Eric Dolphy, Freddy Hubbard, Charlie Haden, Ed Blackwell, Scott La Faro, Billy Higgins and Don Cherry. The music is actually composed - though not in the traditional sense of the word. The order of the soloists is clear. The bridge is repeated between every solo, the rhythm is coherent. There is an emotional continuity throughout the whole CD. What makes the music here so special is the interplay between the musicians, the way each of them supports and adds behinds each solo. When you hear Dolphy's Bass Clarinet laughing in the background it has to make you smile. The joy that the musicians must have felt while recording the music is heard beautifully. The drums and bass (each doubled) participate in the celebration in a way that should be studied by every modern composer - they are equal members while being fully aware of each instrument's strength and limitations. A must for every fan of non-commercial music, and for EVERY musician from any genre.
0800177177|5.0|Francis Ford Coppola's BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA is a dramatically and artistically sophisticated interpretation of the novel. Of the modern film versions produced since the Hammer Studios series with Christopher Lee, this is by far the best in terms of production values, acting and dramatic interest.<br />A fine cast with Winona Ryder, Gary Oldman, Keanu Reeves and Anthony Hopkins make for a well-played horror drama. The photography and special effects are superb and frighteningly effective. The DVD's widescreen presentation is literally picture-perfect with crisp visuals and fantastic surround sound. <br />The colors are richly saturated especially in the red and black tones. Color, especially red figures importantly in the visual aspect of telling the Dracula tale. The eerie spectral voices for some of the most intense vampire scenes I've ever seen are provided by Diamanda Galas. You won't hear more authentic moaning or screaming in any modern vampire film. This is a great version of Dracula to be 'savored' on a stormy, windy and of course, very dark night with the lights turned off!<br />Well worth the money for the DVD versus the video. Saw this in its original theatrical release and loved it. You won't be disappointed with viewing it on DVD in your living room.
B00003CXCS|3.0|Lets start with the story, I never really thought there were any austrians that really hated the nazis for the _right_ reasons. the story is boring, its not even funny, and its very nice that julie andrews sings the songs herself but its not enough. the movie is too long. The songs are good but not as brilliant as Oklahoma!,Carousel,South Pacific , etc.. I Gave it 3 stars and not one because of &quot;Do Re Me&quot;.
B000002HPT|4.0|I may be a little biased since this is my favorite group on the planet but this is a very solid effort from an extremely talented group.  From the opening note to the last it is hard to pick out any bad parts.  I think this was the best disk since Images and Words before Metropolis was released last year.  Songs I recommend for listening are Lines in the Sand (Prog Masterpiece!!!), Peruvian Skies, and Burning My Soul.  Make this a part of your collection today.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|After the really bad trailers on TV, I really was not goin to watch this one ! My friends dragged me for it ! To be really honest this is a really good movie ! It's simple, romantic movie that combines Romeo and Juliet with Pretty Woman. The musical score is wonderful and I would recommend buying the album. The big winner is the musical score and it haunts you through the moivie and after the movie's over (you'll surpise yourself when you start humming the tunes of &quot;Your Song&quot; and &quot;Come What May&quot;.<br />Nicole Kidman looks gorgeous as usual and the real surprise to the audience is her amazing voice. Her rendition of &quot;One Day I'll Fly Away&quot; is wonderful. Ewan McGregor has an amazing voice. He's probably the real revelation in this musical of love, freedom, truth and beauty. A True Bohemian VICTORY !!!!!!!!!!!
B000021XS0|5.0|I was able to see them perform this album live last April in London.  What an epic.  I firmly believe that DT are the best Prog Metal group on the planet.  To see these 5 musicians play live is a very eye opening experience.  They are all technical and precise in their notes and time signature changes.  You have to see them perform to really appreciate it.  Before seeing them live, I knew of the talent of John Petrucci, Mike Portnoy and James Labrie.  Being a guitar player myself really caused me to kind of drown out the keyboards and bass guitar.  John Myung is a very underrated bassist.  He too is very technical and comes up with some great bass lines for the songs.  Also, Jordan Rudess is an excellent keyboardist in his own right.  Pick up this video and watch them play like few musicians can.  You will be knocked off you feet by their prowess, I guarantee it.  And if you haven't got the CD yet.  Purchase it as well, I rate it as their bast album, behind their classic, Images and Words!!!
6300269639|4.0|Okay, let me start by saying that I do really like this film, but not in ways you think. As an &quot;Eastwood&quot; I think its one of his worse. But, I think Clint, when he read the book, fell in love with the best part of it...the fighter scenes! When I saw this thing WAAAY back in '82, I really enjoyed it. What did I know..I was a kid!! The film to me know looks really weird, especially the performances of the Russians.  The script made the Soviet Union like it was Nazi, Germany (Whoa! Don't get me wrong, I know the USSR was not a fun place to live during that period); after awhile expected the military characters to raise their arms in a Heil Hitler salute. Most of them were performed by German character actors! The actor who steals it for me is the one who played General Vladimirov, he's so icy--but he does crack and curse out the 1st secretary. Great scene. The first 90 minutes will kill you--just faast forward to the last hour, the scenes with firefox 1 and 2 flying over the polar icecap is breathtaking. Clint's &quot;in-the-cockpit&quot; shot are very realistic, he really did his homework on that one. Everything said and done, Firefox is worth a look if you're a diehard Clint fan or even a John Dykstra one. Also Maurice Jarre music is fun filled (sometimes a little too close to Grand Prix for my tastes). Enjoy!
0140177396|5.0|This is a story about George and Lennie.  George is a small man, he is smart, and underneath it all, he loves Lennie.  Lennie is a huge man, but was born a slow man, and he sort of reminds you of the big guy in The Green Mile.  <br /> Lennie always gets into trouble, not on purpose, but because he likes to pet things, like mice, and sometimes women's dresses if they look like they would feel nice.  That's how they got thrown out of a few of there jobs, and is the basis of the book.  <br /> There is some foul language in the book, but regular working folk don't really mind eachother's bad language, and the bad language brings you farther into the book, like you were actually working on the farm.      For a short book, it packs a lot of surprises that I wasn't expecting at all.  The end is truly sad, and it left questions, but that's what a good book does in my mind.<br /> John Steinbeck really brought you into the minds of both George and Lennie, and described each character very well.  I am looking forward to reading Mr. Steinbeck's other novels.<br />Mark_Sigel
0790729628|4.0|Its a mixed blessing to have this title.  Its better than not having the movie out at all on DVD.  However this Bladerunner DVD version is in much need of an overhaul.  I am sure it is one of the first DVDs ever released.  So I do not fault it greatly for not having any extras...but they would be nice.  And as I am a big fan of the directors cut, I don't miss the original narrated version...but having both versions on a newer DVD would be nice for the fans. The really important reason for a new version of the DVD is the print and video mixing are just barely tolerable.  The contrast is blown out making the city effects sequences in particular look ugly harsh and grainy. That's really a shame as this film is all about creating an awe inspiring vision of a bleak future Los Angeles. And secondly, the widescreen version has a very thick black border surrounding the entire image cutting down on the already reduced size of the image making it all the smaller for people wanting to watch the film in widescreen.  No doubt this smaller territory for the image causes the film to look less sharp, and more grainy. If you buy DVDs for the enhanced picture quality. Don't look for this DVD to deliver for you.  Whether you love it or think it is slow and boring, Bladerunner is considered a classic in its genre and merits a better treatment.  Unfortunately, I am sure the studios are making money on this staple title, so I think a revised version is a long time coming.
0743216385|5.0|Band of Brothers is one of the best books I've read on the Normandy invasion.  I have personally met many of the brave men who members of Easy company, and have just returned from Normandy to watch the HBO premiere of &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;.  Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, and crew did an excellent job capturing the mood of what happened to these men on and since June 6, 1944.  I highly recommend this book!
B000001C6D|5.0|This is truly one the best hard rock or heavy metal albums of all time. The lead guitar playing by Gregor Mackintosh is both powerful and melodic along with Nick Holmes semi-growl vocals are fantastic. The music just draws you in after repeated listenings.  A true classic right up there with Master of Puppets, Reign in Blood and Iron Maiden. Why this gem is out of print is beyond me. If you can find it you are guaranteed an uplifting headbanging experience. Amust for any collector of great metal from it's glory days, 1970 - 1994.
B000000I0G|4.0|Not Mike's best album, but certainly a very good one. The second part of Taurus here is one of his better epic-length compositions, here reprising at the start the original chord progression from Taurus I, but played on different instruments. It goes above and beyond the scope of the first however, across the path of it's 25 minutes. Family Man follows, a track he co-wrote with a bunch of other people, and definately a different one for Mike. It's almost like a standard rock/pop song, fused with his own guitar and instrumentation. (It later became a hit for Hall &amp; Oates.) The remaining songs are decent enough, but don't really hold up to the standard of the opening epic. Still, an Oldfield fan will want this album for it alone, in addition to the adequate tracks that fill out the album.
0930289234|5.0|I bought this book, and i didn't put it down until it was done, it was incredible, worth every penny and probably a whole lot more, art is awesome, and Alan Moore's writing style is, unique, for lack of a better term, if you want an amazing read, this is the title for you.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool has evolved into a postgrunge version of an art rock group beyond compare. I hear echoes of King Crimson, Pink Floyd, Rush, and of course Led Zeppelin in Lateralus. I must admit that the Maynard's lyrics are not as thought-provoking or sophisticated as say Billy Corgan's or the godfather of art rock - Peter Gabriel's, but adequate nonetheless. It is truly the music that steals the show. I particularly like &quot;Triad&quot;. In shear aggression, it outdoes anything put out by NIN (sorry Trent) for quite sometime. <br />I wish Tool continued success.
0385501560|5.0|drop whatever you are doing and read this now.  i read this book in about 4 hours, unable to put it down.  its full of the quotes and ideas that youd expect to find in a palahniuk novel - things so brilliant and obvious that we never can think of on our own.  buy this book now.
0060392886|3.0|These guys are crazy!  I enjoyed it to a point but their story lacks the quality of the one told about Alice In Chains in &quot;Unchained...The Story Of Mike Starr.&quot;  These are the two best books fresh out about the dark inside of the rock and roll scene.  Notorious?  Not as sinister as Alice In Chains.  LA rocks is phony to me.  How many times can your ears perk up hearing how Tommy Lee made it with Pamela Lee Anderson?  Overall these guys are cool and their story is worth reading.
B00005B4GU|2.0|After Radiohead's brilliant &quot;Kid A&quot; CD, I was much looking forward to their &quot;Amnesiac&quot; album.  unfortunatly, after listening to &quot;Amnesiac&quot; I can't help but to be dissapointed.  I respect (and usually enjoy) Radiohead's creativity, but this time they took it overboard.  I just couldn't get into it, like I could with Kid A.  I wasn't taken to that magical place I go to everytime I listen to the previous album.  After listening to the new release, I was frustrated and had a headache.  I think with a stronger musical backbone (some sort of rythm), &quot;Amnesiac&quot; would have been brilliant.  However, I can't help but feel that Radiohead got lazy after their grammy nominated &quot;Kid A&quot; album.
B00000745F|5.0|Mind-blowingly brilliant album that is guaranteed not to disappoint fans of melodic guitar-driven rock. The US and UK versions are identical.
B00004YW6I|4.0|PJ Harvey has changed her artistic persona every couple of albums since she been making music.  In the early 1990s, she was a lascivious diva with the blues influence Dry and Rid of Me.  Then in 1995 she released her most ambitious (and best) album, To Bring You My Love.  To Bring You My Love was an audacious synthesis of Johnson-esque blues, industrial/techno sonics, and religious mythology (also reminscent of early blues) presented through Harvey's cogent, but graceful vocals, and literate lyrics.  In this intrepid sonic gumbo, Harvey was a garish, tormented heroine.  She continued in this direction with her next album, the oblique, somewhat unfocused Is This Desire? (1998).<br />Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea is a satisfying culmination of her previous efforts, both musically and thematically.  Musically, Stories often recalls her spare, blues influenced early work, but also on occassion her more ambitious ventures into electronica.  Thematically, Stories is probably the most psychologically forthright album Harvey has released.  This time, Harvey expresses her feelings directly, rather than through an exterior persona.<br />Stories begins with the rousing, aggressive, &quot;Big Exit&quot;.  From a less capable a singer, lyrics like, &quot;Baby, baby, ain't it true, I'm immortal when I'm with you&quot;, would feel forced and overblown, but Harvey's vocal prowess makes it believable.  The more subdued, &quot;Good Fortune&quot;, might also sound pretentious in less capable vocal cords (&quot;And I feel like some bird of paradise, my bad fortune slipping away, And I feel the innocence of a child, everybody's got something good to say&quot;), Harvey's delivery makes feel sincere.  On, &quot;The Whores Hustle and the Hustlers Whore&quot;, she laments that, &quot;To many people are out of love&quot;, against delicate electronic effects similar (though more subtle) to her best work on To Bring You My Love and Is This Desire?  On the alluring, &quot;This Mess We're In&quot;, sung mostly by Radiohead's Thom Yorke, Harvey turns a one-night-stand (I think) into a deeply spiritual experience:  &quot;I just want say, don't every change now baby, and thank you, I don't think we will meet again, And you must leave now, before the sun rises above the river...  Sweat on my skin, oh, this mess we're in&quot;.  &quot;This is Love&quot;, contains one of Harvey's funniest, most memorable refrains:  &quot;I can't believe life is such a mess, when I just want to sit here and watch you undress.&quot;  The closing track, &quot;We Float&quot;, effectively summarizes Harvey's present emotional state:  &quot;We float, Take life as it comes&quot;.<br />Not everything on Stories works so well.  &quot;Kamikaze&quot;, is an immature, generic blues track that sounds like a left-over from the Rid of Me recording sessions.  Patti Smith has always been a muse for Harvey, but on, &quot;Horses in My Dreams&quot;, she emulates Smith so closely (both lyrically and musically) it borders on plagiarism.<br />While Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea isn't as creatively audacious as some of her earlier work, it is a satisfying album from an artist who maturing in the best sense of the word.  Harvey's direct, personal songwriting has made her more listenable without compromising her passion.  Harvey has never sounded more comfortable with herself, and the result, while probably not her best album, might be her most enjoyable.
B000003S0D|4.0|In the hit-and-miss world of early 70s King Crimson, Lizard is a hit; unlike the unoriginal Poseidon and the pedestrian Islands, it's a surprisingly strong record by a band that never really managed to get its act together until 1973.  Gordon Haskell's unconventional vocals are usually a prime target for ridicule, but they fit this album reall well.  Haskell sounds much better than Boz Burrell and even Greg Lake's prog melodramatics grow old after a while.  The cool thing about Lizard is that it's so damn strange -- there's no other King Crimson album that even tries to match its mutant mix of jazz, rock, and classical.  The band even tries to tackle the super-cliche of progressive rock, a 20 minute epic suite with Jon Anderson of Yes on vocals, and manages to turn the cliches inside out.  How many other prog epics have a Bolero section with dissonant multi-horn improvisation?  Side one has four shorter pieces.  \\"Happy Family\\" gets slammed a lot, but Gordon Haskell's manic, processed vocals, Pete Sinfield's obscure lyrics and the schizophrenic free jazz blowing make a great combination.  One of Crimson's best tunes ever.  Add that to \\"Cirkus\\", \\"Lady of the Dancing Water\\" (some beautiful flute on that one), and the Anglo-funk from Pluto of \\"Indoor Games\\", and you've got a great batch of music.
B000002J0P|5.0|At the time, it may have seemed like a gimmick.  Let's get the lead singers of three big rock groups and form a new group.  Well, their voices blended together proved that this was a god-given natural.  Beautiful, soaring harmonies.  Pristine, acoustic guitar work.  This is one of the most listened to releases in my life.  It can be a time capsule for some, recalling those romantic, hippy-trippy days of the late 60's and early 70's.  Anyone who calls this boring, should just go ahead and bang his head against the wall for excitement. Great, intelligent acoustic rock has stood the test of time.  Essential to any collection!
0783240287|5.0|The only downside to my buying this DVD is that now I regret that I never saw this show live, especially when Donny Osmond was playing Joseph.  I had previously owned a cast recording of this show on CD, which I liked fairly well and listened to occasionally.  Now that I've watched this DVD, the cast recording seems flat and dull in comparison.  This DVD version is just fantastic!  Better voices and so much more energy.<br />I love all of the cast on this version.  Donny Osmond is simply perfect as Joseph, and Maria Friedman is captivating as the narrator.  And there are so few musicals like this one, where the music is consistently good.  It's just one great song after another.  I only wish it was longer!<br />&quot;Joseph&quot; is good, light-hearted fun and rarely takes itself seriously.  It would be appropriate for kids except for the Mrs. Potiphar scene.  When my toddler is watching with me, I skip over that bit.<br />I also enjoyed the behind-the-scenes video that was included in the bonus materials.  I was a little bored with the segments on the school productions, but there were other bits that were interesting and fun to watch.  I especially liked the part about memorizing all the colors.<br />I've watched this DVD so many times now that I've nearly got them memorized myself..
B000002KJQ|5.0|I own about 10 ZZ Top albums.  This one and Deguello are the ones I keep coming back to.  I love all kinds of music including classical and jazz, but what fascinates me about this group is their genuine love for the blues and their clever musicianship. They also have a sense of humor.  Most rock bands take themselves way too seriously.  This album is hot and relentless.  Standout cuts: La Grange, Master of Sparks, Jesus Just Left Chicago, Precious and Grace and more.  The food photo inside the CD is one you'll always remember as well as this great music.  I don't particularly like the mix from the Sixpack Box Set, so if you can find it in its original form, more power to you.  I'm a fan of theirs and as far as I'm concerned this one's my all-time favorite with Deguello running a close second.
6305127638|1.0|I hated this movie.  Hated it.  One reason I really hated this movie is it's inconsistant with the TV series.  In the old TV series we've already been introduced to Zefram Cochrane.  He's not even remotely the same type of person in this movie.  They didn't make this mistake with Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan so why did they mess it up here?<br />Then, worse, the changed the borg.  The whole point of the borg is that they are relentlessly logical.  They act like a computer.  You can't reason with them.  That's what made them different and therefore interesting from all the other enemies in the Star Trek universe.  Once they introduce the Borg queen and she turns out to have emotions and to be seducable etc she's all of a sudden boring because at that point the borg are no longer the borg but just like any other regular enemy with all the standard faults and crap.<br />*Warning: Spoiler* Next on my list was the miss direction of the trailer.  In the original trailer for the movie you see Picard saying &quot;The line stops here!!!&quot;.  It looks like he's going to kick some major butt.  So then in the movie when he actually never kicks any butt it's big let down.  The whole time I was waiting for him to step up and really take the borg on and instead it all comes down to Data punching a hole in a can with his fist.  That's the big finally.  Punching a hole in a can.  How exciting, NOT!!!
B000002AGN|5.0|Even though, I've been a fan of Dave Brubeck Quartet for many years, I've never really been comfortable with him as a pianist at times.  He plays sometimes like he's angry, playing those big heavy block chords.  It balances out with Paul Desmond's dreamlike, light alto sax.  My favorites are when Brubeck does calm down a bit and plays beautiful rubato as in &quot;Strange Meadow Lark&quot; and the lilting, poignant and gorgeous &quot;Kathy's Waltz&quot;. Desmond steals the show however.  His playing is heavenly, light and dreamlike.  Each cut is outstanding.  There are time explorations like 5/4, 6/8 etc.  Take Five is now so familiar it sounds like music for a commercial, but don't be fooled, it is a great piece of innovative music.  Joe Morello on drums is off the wall and insanely good.  Eugene Wright applies the syrup with his steady bass.  Enough said.  One of the greatest jazz releases ever.  Essential to any collection!

B000005H7D|5.0|Blue Train is my favorite Coltrane release.  If &quot;A Love Supreme&quot;  sounds too zen-like and just too weird, then stick to the likes of this release and Coltrane's My Favorite Things and Giant Steps. Coltrane was the greatest tenor sax player after Parker's death, and this has been called perhaps his greatest album.  It features also Lee Morgan on trumpet, who plays a Clifford Brown type horn with a bit more funk and Curtis Fuller on Trombone, along with Bass expert Paul Chambers, great piano work by Kenny Drew and drums by the legendery Philly Joe Jones.  My favorite piece is: Moment's Notice.  If you're looking for one Coltrane CD, pick this one up.  It is simply beautiful jazz and the ultimate treatment (Enhanced CD) is the only way to go.  I used to own the regular CD, but a classic this good deserves only the ultimate treatment.  Wonderful! Wonderful!
B00005B4GU|4.0|After the shock, for many, that was 'Kid-A', lot of Radiohead fans are waiting for return to the anthemic Radiohead which created 'The Bends'. It might be a little disappointing to them, but for the people who have stuck by the band's side, this new inventive style will be very pleasing.  Thom Yorke has previously said that listening to Kid A is like looking from afar at the fire in the Kid A booklet, and listening to Amnesiac is like standing in that same fire. Amnesiac is not an easier album than Kid A. Although, some of the elements in Amnesiac were written and recorded during the same session that produced Kid-A. But, Amnesiac comes out to be  darker, and at times, dramatically more experimental than anything Radiohead has done. It contains one of the finest pieces the band has ever recorded, the gorgeos string-washed 'Pyramid Song' with mekancholy-sounding piano, spacese drumming, and smooth haunting vocals.<br />Overall, a great album with not-so constant mood, unlike Kid-A and OK-Computer, more commercialized. Personally, I like Dollars&amp;Cents, Knives Out and pyramid song alot.
0064407667|1.0|Five stars.  One star.  Hardly anything in between.  What's areview-reader to think?<br />I picked this book up one night at[abookstore]  while they just happened to be running a promotion on Lemony Snicket.  I was in the mood for something witty to feed my children's book habit and, after reading the promising letter back of the (beautifully designed) book and soaking up to [the bookstore's]  promo vibes, I bought it.<br />Perhaps because I had such high expectations, or perhaps because at 18 I'm just too old to understand such things, I was greatly disappointed.  The storyline feels one-dimensional.  The book carries no emotion, even regarding the children's loss of their parents.  The book back's letter promises hilarity, but the contents are not really that funny.  Baby Sunny's people-biting ceases to be amusing after the first couple of times she does it.  Violet and Klaus have personalities only on the most superficial level:  Violet likes to invent, Klaus likes to read.  That's it.  The characters don't sneer or whimper or even shout very often--they simply say whatever it is they're saying.  (Now I know why my junior high English teacher didn't allow us to use the word &quot;said&quot; when we wrote stories.  It gets boring very quickly.)  The &quot;mystery&quot;--why is Count Olaf, who wants the children's inheritance money, forcing Violet to act in the Marvelous Marriage play, which just happens to also include a real judge--is not very mysterious, at least to an old geezer like myself.  And lastly, Mr. Lemony Snicket takes a whole page near the end of the book just to warn the reader of the only thing in the story that might be considered a twist.<br />I am baffled that reviewers compare A Series of Unfortunate Events with the ineffably sublime Harry Potter.  I understand (and wholeheartedly agree with) comparisions of J.K. Rowling with Roald Dahl and even Shakespeare. (Do a theme analysis and just tell me what you see.  There's a reason people keep reading that stuff.)  JKR is a genius.  Lemony Snicket, or the powers behind him, seem to have just decided one day to write a book.<br />My advice:  don't get this just because you're craving an HP fix.  Pick it up in the bookstore and actually read a couple of chapters.  If you like what you read, then go right ahead and get it.  But do not purchase this book without having sampled it first.  You may just find it to be missing the good stuff.
014028009X|4.0|This book was good.  and if a movie hadn't been made about it, i probably wouldn't really miss it.  however, i did read the book, then i went to the movie.  the only reason i prefered the movie is because the style of writing it like a diary (which i know is half the point) got on my nerves.  it made it harder to follow everything.  overall, good book, pretty easy read, i read it in about a day and half.
0790743132|5.0|If you know has to how great of a movie Casablanca is, then why are you reading this review? Get off your computer and watch Casablanca over and over and over again. If you don't own it yet, buy it and watch it over and over and over again! <br />With great acting by Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Paul Heinreid, Claude Rains and especially by Sydney Greenstreet as Sam the piano player and Peter Lorre as Ugarte, Smart humor (Which does not need a graphic sex joke or a guy molesting an animal to get laughs), a fantastic music score by Max Steiner and classic lines (\\"Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship\\", \\"Here's looking at you kid\\") make Casablanca a true classic of American cinema. If you don't like it, or if you don't want to see it, there is something very wrong with you.
014100018X|5.0|first off, i saw the movie before i read the book, i didn't even realize it was a book until about 2 monthes after i saw the movie.  i usually try to avoid doing this because it sometimes will ruin the book.<br />this book kept me reading until i finished it, even though i basically knew what would happen.  it also made me really want to go to France and find a really good chocolate store!<br />the main thing about this book that i really loved, was that even though most of the town was against her, she did her best to be kind to them without changing herself to what they wanted her to be.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|This soundtrack is very modern and consists of the best music heard in ages. Just one critism is that some of the other brilliant music from the movie is not on it and would like to have a second cd with it on. Otherwise it is the best.
B00000DR5D|5.0|Definitivamente este album lo considero la cspide en la carrera de Tangerine Dream. Hasta ese momento ( y creo que despus tambien) Froese, Baumman y Franke no haban logrado una pieza tan perfecta y pura en su contexto musical. Muchos consideran a &quot;Phaedra&quot; y &quot;Rubycon&quot; como los trabajos ms relevantes de Tangerine Dream pero debo diferir de esa aseveracin poniendo a este album; &quot;Ricochet&quot; en un lugar ms alto.Es el album perfecto para presentar a Tangerine por vez primera a un oyente. No podemos olvidar que este es un album grabado en vivo y que el efecto sonoro que se obtiene es francamente impresionante, quiz hasta ms que el trabajo de estudio.  Ricochet es una pieza dividida en dos partes. El comienzo esta marcado por vibraciones y &quot;drones&quot; de maquinaria anloga. Luego estas pulsaciones ritmicas se convierten en un panorama sonoro que transporta al oyente hasta sus mismsimos cimientos. La segunda parte comienza con un hermoso arpegio de piano creando la atmsfera para lo que luego se convertira, junto a ms pulsaciones, vibraciones y melodas extradas de sintetizadores y guitarra, un final bombstico y omnipresente que dejar al escucha sin aliento.
B00005BJ2O|2.0|I was really disappointed in the soundtrack.  I absolutely love the song by Christina, Pink, Mya and Lil' Kim but the rest of the CD is a waste in my opinion.  Granted, I have NOT seen the movie and maybe if I had, I would be more impressed by the CD.  But, it just isn't \\"my kinda music\\".  There ARE a couple of decent songs on the soundtrack CD but most are not.  Of course, the best one is the title song by those four terrific singers!  If I would have known the rest of this CD was what it is, I would have saved my [price]!
B00005B36H|5.0|Simply stated, this is a classic hard rock release from a band that I've never paid much attention to.  This album leaps and bounds with energy and adrenaline.  The epic nature of Lateralus is something many bands attempt but scarce few achieve.  Lateralus is that rare hard rock release which relies on brute force and - listen up, kids - MUSICALITY AND DYNAMICS!  From the crisp and dense production to the mesmerizing rhythmic shift to, yes, the sensational packaging, Lateralus has all the makings of and album we'll all still be listening to 20 years from now...

0441003257|4.0|The end of the world is arriving on Saturday! The Four Horsemen of Apocalypse have already started their ride, strange incidents have started to occur all over the world (atlantis rising, aliens visiting), and the forces of Heaven and Hell are beginning to get involed. However, the Antichrist (who is 11 years old), is kind of unaware of all this.. he and his friends just want to have fun - and might not agree with the role they were detined to fulfill thousands of years ago.<BR> A collage of many different characters, from devils, to demons, to witchhunters, to witches - this book is extremely witty and fun. You can feel the influence of both Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman - it reminded me a lot of Douglas Adams, especially in his Dirk Gently series. So anybody who has liked the crazy humor kind of book - you won't like to miss this one!!
B00003CXN4|3.0|I saw a lot of movies last year, and was very disappointed with this year's Oscars when Gladiator won best picture! as I thought that movie reeked..but this is really about how much better I think that TRAFFIC is.  I thought that both Michael Douglas and Belnicio Del torro(i don't know if I spelled that right) were both amazing in this movie.  Belnicio definitely deserved his OSCAR statue!  The rest of the players certainly weren't bad, but no one was as good as those two guys.  Douglas is a politician who is campaigning the war on drugs while his teenage daughter is getting high on crack..how ironic.. and our OSCAR winner is a cop in Mexico trying to catch someone with drugs.  The other story that ties with these two is the one with Catherine Zeta Jones, who plays the wife of a drug dealer that has been arrested.  She spends the rest of the film trying to get him out of jail and kept out. The stories all kept me very interested through the 2 and a half hours of the film.  The length of the film is what really got to me, it did have a few dragging parts and I just feel that some of this movie could've been edited out.  It is worth a rental fee, but I don't think it's worth buying.
B00004SYWZ|5.0|This album is welcome in the music of today. I am only 25 but i find most music today (and i use the word music loosly)has become noise. This however has great melodys, wonderful singing and a great mix of types. I have always liked A-HA and it is great to have them back and with such a great album. I also have to agree with the previous reveiwer Morten has the best voice in the pop buisness. If you are a new A-HA listner don't get this first start at the bigging your in for a great treat. Buy this one its great
0060987464|5.0|i read this book and i loved it. i hate to read but the first night i got this book i read 80 pages!!!! this book is amazing i think that everyone should read this.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I really enjoyed this, movie Nicole Kidman did a great job, the story is very good. I liked Ewan's performamce this is, a musicial but who cares I loved it, the movie is sad also I won't explain why you'll need to go see it, the music to the movie is great, so if you like musicals go see this it is PG-13 though. Well have a fun summer.
0684865130|5.0|There will always be a place in my Parking Lot for this book!<br />I'll never forget the opening line: 'It was love at first sight.' Of course, it's not a love story. Yossarian is in the hospital, but of course he doesn't (quite) have jaundice. Of course he's not too crazy to fly, because he knows flying missions is crazy. And there's no morphine in the first-aid kits, because everybody has a share.<br />And if you don't think that's funny, there's lots more that's not even funnier! What a book!!!<br />oxoxoxo
B00000099Y|5.0|I read a review a bit down criticizing Tool for playing the same chord in every song in different time signatures, and it just struck my intellectual gag reflex.<br />No, Tool is not a time signature-obsessed Blink 182- in fact, Adam Jones is probably one of the greatest riff architects of the modern day.  At least, that's what not only pretty much every guitar magazine seems to think, but also most of Jones' peers in the industry (Morello, for instance).  But hey, it's good to criticize someone for drifting too far away from what's happening in the rest of the narrow-focused modern rock world.<br />I hear again and again people shunning Aenima for sounding &quot;too uniform&quot; and I just don't see it.  I guess they were disappointed there weren't any tambourines..?<br />Aenima's subject matter is dealt with and presented in a masterful manner.  The subjects, often oblique, often vague, always with a multitude of interpretations, have generated a multitude of discussion groups on the Internet.  The songs, as a whole, deal largely with cultural evolution and spiritual enlightenment.<br />All in all, I very much recommend Aenima as a hard rock/metal CD to anyone looking to expand their minds.  Lateralus has digressed lyrically from this style, but has matured beyond Aenima to a stratospheric level in terms of musicianship.
B00004XMS0|5.0|I saw the first of the BATMAN Movie series back in '89 and it was awesome!I've never watched a movie before made in such manner as Batman at that time, the fx were great, it set the tone for all the Batman Movies.The storylines were simple but really great, the dark settings was perfect for the caped crusader.Batman series is superbly batter than the Superman Movie series (my apology to supey's fan).And the Actors who played Batman's foes were all very,very brilliant most especially J.Nicholson (astonishing) on the JOKER and J.Carrey(oh man he's really,really great for the role) on The Riddler. Tim Burton & Joel Shumacher really did a good job in reliving the Comic Book Hero into the Big Screen...and oh ofcourse M.Keaton,V.Kilmer & G.Clooney they did a credible acting on Bruce/Batman...although if I may suggest make Batman a little bit human in the next outing because he's too solidly cool during his fights with the villains & during precarious moments which is the reason I'm looking forward to seing the next Batman,oh by the way maybe we could see Kurt Russel or Mel Gibson or even Pierce Brosnan in Batman's tight! I'm sure they'll all be great & lastly may we request James Caneroon or Bryan Singer to come on board, this will be interesting!!!And my verdict...you must be a fool if you'll not gonna pick-upthe BATMAN Legaycy..that is if you're a fan of the Darknight Detective!!!!...
0792837614|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was five years old and I fell in love!  Natalie Wood deserved an Oscar for her role as Maria...I couldn't tell that she wasn't Hispanic (and I'm Hispanic myself!) or that she wasn't doing her own singing.  She is so believable and so sincere as Maria.  <br />Russ Tamblyn (Riff), Richard Beymer (Tony), George Chakris (Bernardo), and Rita Moreno (Anita) were superb!<br />The dancing matched the action and the music perfectly (Kudos to Jerome Robbins) and the music was wonderfully arranged (again...Kudos to Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim).<br />Go out and watch this movie!  You won't regret it!
B000056K04|1.0|As opposed to writing on and on about this album I will sum it all up in two words : Pop Garbage.  How in the world can a band throw out Bartender, Grey Street and the other fantastic songs that were slated for the next album.  Guys, loose the pop producer and go back to what you do best, jam.  Where is the band on this album?  I am a big Dave fan but Carter, Boyd and the rest got pushed off.  What is this No Doubt?  These are too good of musicians to play 3 minute radio friendly songs.  I understand everyone needs a change, but please DMB, GET OVER IT.
B00004XOWM|1.0|This music is garbage. I don't know who invented this rap/metal thing, but they shouldn't have. Oh, it's catchy - like the flu. Anything a person could like about this album could be found in another artist's work and done ten times as well.<br />They extreme proliferation of the f-bomb is stupidly humorous, except that probably 90% of the people listening to this are teen-age boys.<br />If you feel the uncontrollable need to listen to this, do what I did. Take it out of a library, so you don't have to pay for it and so you can give it back.
B00005K9LM|3.0|I will always maintain that THIS is the Priest record where campy theatrics finally overtook solid metal music.  It disappoints throughout.  I simply cannot hear Eat Me Alive or Love Bites and keep a straight face.  The music here is too commercial, too non-descript given Priest's excellent history, and simply not up to par with their legend.  Remember people, the seeds of Turbo started here, don't forget that.  Though there is one track that maintains some glory, The Sentinel.  And why they chose Freewheel Burning, Night Comes Down, and the AWFUL Eat Me Alive to be on the box set Metal Works instead of The Sentinel still puzzles me.<br />And while we're ranting, let me express my disappointment in the remastering.  A little more bass and a little more volume does NOT constitute a &quot;remaster.&quot;  And whatever genius decided that the cover should be nothing more than the old cover with a dull silver/gray border should be killed for ignoring a golden opportunity to really make the remastered CDs stand out.  And what's with the liner notes?  &quot;We liked making this record.  We thought these songs were good.  Yeah.&quot;  Gosh, don't expend any excess energy in making these remasters significantly better than the old versions, guys.  Total underachieving on display here.<br />So there you have it.  The first &quot;bad&quot; Priest CD in all of its emptily &quot;remastered&quot; glory.  No, thanks.
B00001NFCY|5.0|this was the first Creed album i bought. it's really good, but, not as good as the My Own Prison album. but this is still really good. i give it 5 stars. it is musically more evolved than the My Own Prison cd, but lacks the dark lyrics of the first album. but it's still awesome. i'll take it apart with the songs:<br />1. Are you ready?- this is a good song. interesting sound cause it has this weird tuning. almost mid-east sounding in the beginning. really good intro song (it's called \\"Are you ready\\" so.......). song rating: 5<br />2. What If- awesome song. just great. i think it's probably the hardest song on the album. great song. nice message. the video's cool. probably around 3rd or 4th best song on the album. song rating: 5<br />3. Beautiful- really good song. great meaning. good all around. can't say anymore. good song. song rating: 5<br />4. Say I- good song. doesn't really stand out a whole lot to me but it's good. but that's just me. you need to buy it inorder to see for yourself. song rating: 4 1/2<br />5. Wrong Way- same thing as Say I, the way i go about it. good song, but doesn't stand out. song rating: 4 1/2<br />6. Faceless Man- Best song on the record. it's all acousitcy and stuff. really good. nice and peaceful and stuff. it should be their next single. cloudy meaning, but only you can see what it is. cool sounding. tuned as Are you ready. it really had the mid-east sound. good song. Mark Tremonti rocks! song rating: 5<br />7. Never Die- great song. nice lyrics and meaning. good sound. song rating: 5<br />8. With Arms Wide Open- really nice song with a good inspiration (he wrote it about his song, Jagger, when he heard that he was gonna be a dad) everything is good and well put together. i like the strings version better tho, but it's on the cd, and it's the same song so.......... song rating: 5<br />9. Higher- good song. good good song. not the best, but it's the \\"radio song\\". in a concert, it really only fits in as an encore song (which is where they put it) catchy riffs and lyrics (that's why it's on the radio) song rating: 5<br />10. Wash Away Those Years- really really deep and meaningful message (listen to it, you'll see). at first it might seem to sad and stuff (it's all like flatted notes and stuff for you musicians) but that's cause it is sad. good song. song rating: 5<br />11. Inside Us All- probably like the 2nd or 3rd best on the album. great song. great meaning. nice guitar solo (go Mark Tremonti!!) song rating: 5<br />Bottom Line: buy it. buy. buy. buy. and another thing, buy the My Own Prison Album and this album is a really good album when you're on the road (probably cause i got it in the summer and we drove all the way to Chicago and..............) buy it.

B00003CXC7|5.0|Rear Window is a landmark film that is a must for anyone. My older kids were mesmerized by this classic thriller. I enjoyed discussing with them why this film is so great in so many ways. Tell me who today can make a film that takes place in one room in which you are viewing it mostly from Mr. Stewart's perspective, where not much action takes place unitl the end, and you are on the edge of your seat for most of the film? The DVD version has some nice added features that any Hitchcock fan will enjoy. This is a no-brainer. Get it! Enjoy
B00004S6GL|4.0|This record has slowly but surely won me over. Fervent admirer that I was of the emotionally brittle, gorgeous stuff he'd put out recently, I had a hard time initially getting past my own preconceptions.<br />But once I spent time with it, fully three-quarters of the record made me a believer again. The last third of the record in particular is a big step forward for him. The second-to-last track of the album - a swirling, vicious cycle that crescendos in a wall of guitar - is the single most exciting piece of music he's ever done. I wish he'd put out a whole album that set his delicate cooing against such a threatening backdrop. Tension-and-release defined.
079213690X|5.0|This is, without doubt, one of the best films I've ever seen. Want violence? It's got it. Want emotion? It's got it. Want it to touch you deep down? Yup, it's can do that too. It's not very historically accurate, but then if that's what you want then go read a textbook. You're as bad the Comic-book guy from the Simpsons. This is a film which works on quality instead of relying on a million different special effects (cough-Titanic-cough). The acting is very good and totally beleivable.<br />I would write on but no review could do this film justice. It's hailed as great. It IS great. And if you like your violence without all the mindless machoism (eg. nearly every typical action film, which this is not) plus you don't like slushy romance but a little is OK then this is the film for you.<br />P.S. It's anti-English and rightly so - I am English myself but I can see the atrocities that the English did and THAT is why I'm no patriot.
006092988X|5.0|&quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; is a real treasure. I don't think anyone who reads it and is a good reader will disagree. I'm sixteen and a real book freak- I read more than 20 books in a year- and I assure you, this is the best book I ever read in my whole life. Apart from being a light reading, it is a very strong and thought-provoking, inspiring novel- the kind that makes you happy and hopeful in a somber kind of way. When I finished it, I looked up and smiled and even my room seemed to brighten up. Step into the world of this young girl from Brooklyn, and you will find yourself there!

B00005B4GU|5.0|I've followed this band for a while now. When they first released 'Pablo Honey' and 'The Bends' I was still in College and songs like 'Weirdo' and 'High and Dry' would serve as background for all-nighters studying.<br /> Time passed and in 97 they released 'OK Computer' an album about which it's absolutely needless to add anything else. It's one of those 20-30 CDs you absolutely have to have in your collection.<br /> Last year they came up with a production WAY OUT there ('Kid A'), completely different from anything they had previously done, with the idea to avoid as much as possible the stardom status they had achieved after 'OK C...'<br /> Barely eight months after 'Kid A' they have released 'Amnesiac' (don't know if, in an effort to forget about 'Kid A'!) but the fact is that the resulting album basically builds up on some of the musical concepts from 'OK Computer' as well as 'Kid A'.<br /> The result is a blend of darker (or industrial, if you may) atmospheres more resembling those they got us used to with 'Kid A' but with a more mellow sound to them, the result of the combination of Thom Yorke's voice, his guitar and the keyboards.<br /> I very highly recommend it... Try 'Knives Out' (my favorite from the album) and you'll see why. Enjoy!
B0000508U6|5.0|I have only one, well, ok, a few things to say about this CD: it's brilliant, beautiful, superb. There really isn't a bad song on here. Sure, Coldplay keeps getting compared to Travis and Radiohead, (who, by the way, are also brilliant) but this CD holds it's own. Here is to their continued success, and may we see much more of them. I know I am-I'm going to their concert tonight!!!
B00004YRQA|1.0|I just got back from buying a brand new PS2 and memory card and excitedly started up a game of FFIX (for playstation 1). Imagine my surprise when I couldn't save my game. At all. While the machine recognized the memory card, the game refused to acknowledge its existence. SO now I'm out almost a hundred dollars for the game and the card and I HAVE NO WAY TO SAVE. Sure, the memory card works just fine for PS2 games. But try to use it with a Playstation 1 game and it's just a piece of crushed plastic wedged into a... machine. And who in there right mind would make us buy it *seperate* from the console? THe whole point is to save your game, and what's the point in playing a game if you can't ever progress? And whoever put a... price tag on this tiny piece of plastic deserves to be fired.
B000002BMV|1.0|Horrible!  I'd rather eat sea slugs then listen to this album.  This is there worst sell out effort yet.  Does anyone remember the video game with this album.  Well they are sell outs so why not have them do a video game.  Gees this album should be put to death more times then you can count.
B000002J1Y|3.0|In most cases the studio versions are superior to these live versions, so you only need this if you must have everything from Yes during this period...not that there's anything wrong with that. However, what you really want if you want live Yes is the early BBC recordings by Yes!
B00000G3Q4|5.0|Forget all the extras, which are really good additions, and get down to the film itself.  It is difficult to put into words how much I like this movie. The combination of gore and the manner in which it is presented, as well as the shocks thrown at us, an eerie score, and a dark atmosphere makes this an exceptional movie. The low-budget feel of the movie presents a much more likeable movie than the modern teen-slashers. Evil Dead exhibits a creativeness that is unlike any movie I have ever seen. The story tells of a few college friends who travel into a cabin in the woods for a weekend of fun. Even before they get there there is a sign of an evil presence, but it goes unacknowledged. Once there they awaken an evil spirit that manages to kill 3 people-and make a hero and in icon of the last one. This movie opened me to horror movies when I first saw it in July of 1999, for the first time. It also inspired me to want to become a filmmaker. Evn if you don't like the movie, more than likely, you'll respect it.
B00004XMTH|5.0|first I want to say this is the best Cats cast ever. Jacob Brent is the perfict mistoffiles and mike glover is a great munkustrap plus elain page, sir john mills and jo gibb everyone else is great too. the makeup and costumes look fantastic. and the music it sounds better than when i seen it in london live!
B000002GVO|1.0|Well the Eagles put out this album it's called Hotel California.<br />There thats my whole review.
0553106635|5.0|I know that many of you are used to seeing glowing reviews of books listed.  This will be no real exception, I cannot dish out enough praise for this book.  Each character is unique and well crafted. Few books have ever brought me to actual tears, but this is one of them, both with laughter and out loud exclamations of shock at various twists and turns in the plot's well traveled thoroughfare.  I have never read a book that was a part of a serious that was able to leave me wanting more but at the same time tie up some loose ends in a deeply satisfying manner.  Mr. Martin gets nothing but high marks from me for this well crafted piece of fantastic fiction.  I cannot wait for the next installment in this series.
B00000AFHM|5.0|Pardon me for the patriotism (okay they're scottish) but there's something here that I realy don't think you'd find stateside. While the tone of the songs is essentially mellow, you'll find a sting in the tail of most of them, providing the oddly hyponotic quality of vocals hasn't lulled you to sleep. Only typing this now do I realise how much this record resembles &quot;Blue Is The Colour&quot; by Beautiful South or perhaps even the Divine Comedy's softer works. But there is something about Belle &amp; Sebastien that is entirely unique. A must.
B000050XEI|4.0|This is a nice Enya album, very soothing and peaceful.  Lyrically more mature than 'Celts', though other than that, Enya is still very much Enya.  Personally I tend to prefer the subtle strength of her sister's voice (Maire Brennan, female lead vocal of Clannad), but this album will still get a four for me.
B000002H33|5.0|This was my first Metallica album, and I must say, it literally hooked me to the band. The first sounds of the album are classical sounding guitars, with a sold melodic intro, and then BAM! all hell breaks lose. Battery (the first track) is like an attack of the senses. You can feel the agression it lets out. It just pummels you. Then, right after that, one of their most acclaimed songs, Master of Puppets, locks you in. I have yet listened to that song and put the album away. I cannot! If I hear Puppets, I hear the whole album.<br />This album has it all. It has great lyrics, incredible riffs, blinding solos, and of course, the `soft song.` [Welcome Home (Sanitarium)] is somewhat of an epic. The intro, the chorus, the ending, the bridge, all different. It's not too long, but it's definatly huge in it's writing. Orion is an instramental. I swear, if this song was converted to orchestra, musical critics would hail it as genius, which it certainly is.<br />That's all for my ranting of this incredible album. Metallica fan or not, you should definatly buy this album.
B00005B7CK|5.0|Ok, I admit it, I only went to see this movie because I knew George Clooney was in it.  Just seeing the very &quot;dapper&quot; Mr. Clooney on the big screen would have been enough reason for me to spend the money for a ticket. (He resembles the very handsome, Clark Gable in this movie) However, I loved the movie for oh so many more reasons.  The music is simply amazing.  In fact, I went out and bought the soundtrack (as soon as I left the theater) for my Dad for a Father's Day gift.  This movie is hilarious too.  Every actor in it does a fabulous job.   The scenery, the history of it all, the urge I felt to run out &amp; buy pomade &amp; hairnets . . . anyway, this movie was great.  You will not be disappointed.
6305971145|5.0|Dudley Moore, John Lithgow, and David Huddleston star in the 1985 masterpiece (that's right, I said masterpiece), \\"Santa Clause the Movie\\". The film starts off by depicting the origin of one of the world's most favorite people, Santa Claus (David Huddleston), showing how he and his wife were brought to a workshop at the North Pole by elves in fulfillment of an ancient prophecy. There, they were granted immortality with the mission of delivering the elf-made toys to the children of the world on one night each year. The film charmingly takes us through the centuries and eventually lands in modern day, when a wealthy little girl named Cornelia befriends a homeless orphan boy named Joe in New York City. The pair also manage to befriend Santa on his nightly ride, but when he returns home and finds his heavy workload is becoming too much for him, Santa decides to take on an assistant. A competition is held, but when the result brings on disaster the following Christmas, an ambitious elf named Patch (Dudley Moore) decides to go out into the world and prove his worth to Santa. It's soon after that he meets B.Z (Lithgow), an unscrupulous, greedy maker of dangerously defective toys. Patch naively teams up with B.Z. to bring the world \\"something special\\" for Christmas, but in the end only Santa Claus himself, with the help of Cornelia and Joe of course, will be able to save Patch and everyone else from the hazardous gifts they create!<br /><br />The Salkinds, the same people who brought you Christopher Reeve as \\"Superman,\\" spared no expense in this epic tale of another high-flying force for good, Santa Claus, appropriately dubbed \\"Santa Claus the Movie.\\" \\"Supergirl\\" director Jeannot Szwarc skillfully handles the reins on this one, and though he follows the same basic formula of the first Reeve Superman film, it's all the detail and charm that makes this holiday classic a masterpiece in its own right. With its magical first half and clever, modern-fairytale second half, \\"Santa Claus the Movie\\" adds up to the best movie about the big man in red made to date. Forget the others if you don't have this one yet! The cast is fantastic, by the way. David Huddleston simply IS Santa, Dudley is delightful as the unworldy, bright-eyed Patch, Lithgow is detestably hilarious as wicked toy pusher B.Z. (reminiscent of Dan Aykroyd's old SNL character), and the kids (Carrie Kei Heim and Christian Fitzpatrick) and Judy Cornwell as Mrs. Claus are perfectly cast as well. The chemistry throughout the cast is amazing, and so are the pre-CGI effects and classic '80's fantasy music from Henry Mancini with one song performed by Sheena Easton!<br /><br />The DVD from Anchor Bay is a must own (mine is the older cover, but I hear it is exactly the same). It's presented in glorious enhanced widescreen and has fantastic extras. You get two U.S. theatrical trailers, plus the International and German trailers, an excellent audio commentary with the director accompanied by Special Projects Consultant for Anchor Bay Scott Michael Bosco, talent bios on the late Dudley Moore and director Jeannot Szwarc, and a fascinating, lengthy, revealing, and in-depth making-of featurette made during the making of the film. Try to ignore the director humiliating one of the elf actors during the \\"making-of\\" featurette, and the fact that it repeatedly drops the ball in keeping up the illusion it initially presents. If you really want to see some pre-CGI movie magic, you have to check out this excellent featurette, and this beautiful film! Get this one on DVD along with \\"The Nativity Story,\\" and you'll have the two most significant origin stories of the Christmas season!he Movie\\" adds up to the best movie about the big man in red made to date.

B00005ASQ1|5.0|Once in while a movie comes out that wins all sorts of academy awards for costumes, acting, music, etc. This is not one of those movies. It is not overly done. Some people have remarked that Sean Connery basically carried the movie. I disagree because it is a simple movie about a student and a teacher. Nothing more and nothing less. It is to the point. No edge of your seat drama. No flashy costumes. The soundtrack is awesome. Over all it is a very inspiring film. All of the actors in it contributed enough to make the movie what it was. I enjoy the fact that there were no racial slurs or every other word a curse word. It was as my title put it. Elegant and Simple! Both the movie and Soundtrack are worth owning.
B000003CKH|5.0|It was the first Cd I bought, and i was very lucky, this is one of my best Cds I have. The John McReas voice sounds great,Greg Brown is an incredible guitar player, and there are a lot of incredible songs like I Will Survive,what a wonderful remake.I just love it how John sings that song,an excellent album!!!
B000002UAU|5.0|A magnificant album celebrating aloneness and alienation, a historic, sensational, manipulative (Paul Is Dead) pop culture thrill-ride driven by very secure hands.
B00004X0ER|4.0|Tight and loud punk. Vocals get a little grating after awhile, but that's the point. This one was a lot of fun.
0345440757|1.0|My well meaning mother sent me this book as a baby present (I am currently in the sixth month of my pregnancy)saying, &quot;this is all the rage now....&quot;   It only took me a few pages to realize that the reason she identified with the philosophy of the book is that it certainly WAS &quot;all the rage&quot; maybe 40 years ago!  I only read a few pages and put the book down-completely turned off by the author's attitude and approach.  The only good idea that I noted (in my opinion) was her suggestion to talk to the infant as a person and explain things as you go along, but that seems to me a natural thing and more common sense than something I would need a book to tell me. After my intial experiance with this book, I skipped around the chapters and found nothing to change my first impression. I am glad I read books by more highly credentialed authors first before seeing this one as they gave me the perspective to pick up on the author's potentially harmful information.  It is clear that she carved out a market for herself by playing on new parents fears.
0140186395|4.0|East of Eden is a beautifully written novel by John Steinbeck.Within it,Steinbeck retells the Biblical stories of &quot;the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel.&quot;These are told through the dynamic characters and their place in the history of California's Salinas Valley.The personalities of the main characters are played to the extreme.Adam is always extremely good and always wants to do the right thing.His son,Aron,is the same way,good and pure.Cathy,Adam's wife,is the exact opposite and is often portrayed as a monster.Caleb,Cathy and Adam's other son,can't accept it,but he is much like his mother because he always thinks of doing bad things.These main charaters are mostly used as symbols in the retelling of the Biblical stories.The first way these stories are told is throught the relationship of Adam and Charles,his half-brother.Charles is very competitive and always tries to beat Adam out of everything, including their father's love.Their highly competitive relationship is like the one of Cain and Abel.When Cathy comes into Adam's life,he immediatly falls in live with her but Cathy's feeling are not the same.Even though,she still marries him.After the birth of her twin sons,Aron and Caleb,she shoots her husband and then runs away to a whorehouse.This recreated &quot;the fall of Adam and Eve.&quot;The tragic story of Cain and Abel is again retold through the lives of Caleb and Aron.Caleb is never violent with Aron but he can't help doing terrible things tohis brother.All in all,East of Eden is a wonderful book that I recommend to anyone who loves learning about human nature.

B000000I0D|5.0|Crises is my favourite of  Mike Oldfield's eighties CDs. As with its direct predecessor, it contains one long piece which took up the whole of the first side of the original vinyl and a set of shorter tracks, five in this case, on the second side. The shorter songs on the earlier albums were often a lot weaker than the longer pieces. Partly that was because Oldfield's musical style was not transferring well to shorter pieces but also, the lyrics were often quite dire.<br />Experience clearly helped a lot but also collaboration with other musicians. On Crises, the most notable name is Jon Anderson of Yes who is creditied with lyrics and vocals on one song &quot;In High Places&quot; which really sounds as though it could have come from a contemporary Yes album.<br />The opening track, &quot;Crises&quot; is classic Oldfield music and in places harks back to his first album &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; so fans will reconise the motifs and see how he takes them forwards in a more rock based style.<br />Moonlight Shadow is Oldfield's finest short song. The great lyrics of this dark lament really give Maggie Reilly a proper showcase for her fine voice. Also, on this track we get to find out that Oldfield really can play a proper blues style guitar sole. It's one of those songs that everyone has heard which stays with you for a long time.<br />This is probably the best introduction to Oldfield's later output for anyone who knows him only as the &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; man.
B00003CX8I|4.0|Comic fans beware-it's not a perfect adaptation of the comic books.  But the setup for the school is the way I'd always dreamed of the Xavier Institute as being; filled with kids, human and mutant, who are all learning and growing up together.  The camios of Kitty Pride, Pyro and Jubilee are there to be watched for, and Iceman, though too young, is a great character.  Patrick Stuart is the perfect Xavier, and Hugh Jackman is the only person to play Wolverine.  It was a wonderful story to behold, and I look forward to the sequel.
630460291X|1.0|The movie is ok for what it is. Thursday night entertainment. You get one film format and the extras are the same on both sides of the disk. PLUS you MUST turn over the disk to VIEW the entire movie! If I had known that I would not have bought the DVD. I do not recommend the DVD. Do like a previous review suggested and buy it on VHS if you must have it.
6305750750|4.0|THe action sequences are spetacular. The fighting is very well chreographed and the Podrace was done extremely great. The characters could use a little more development, but overall a good movie. It lives up and is similar to the plot of A New Hoppe, the whole damsel in distress, and really mean bad guy.
B00005B4GU|1.0|Despite the wrath of Radiohead fans I am sure to endure, I have this funny feeling that the members of the band are laughing at all the critics that called this album &quot;brilliant.&quot;  Yes, I believe this recording is a joke.  After listening to Amnesiac, I can't figure out the appeal.  Perhaps I just don't get it, maybe I'm not intelligent enough to understand the &quot;concept album.&quot;  I should probably stick to music that displays some sense of feeling and musical ability.  Vocals that are sung while half-asleep and songs comprised of one measure repeated over and over and over again are probably too deep for me to understand.  To all those that claim to love this album: Amnesiac - the height of pretentiousness.
B00000IQMT|4.0|The CD is overall good, some of the songs are really impresive with the changes in tempo, volume, and overall the music is similar to A New Hope Soundtrack. The Duel of Fates song is great, the choir and music is a perfect compliment to the Star Wars music.
B00005B4GU|2.0|After Pink Floyd released Dark Side of the Moon, the band was faced with the nightmare all bands experience after they know they have produced something truly great; that very rare and unexplainable magic when everything clicks and the music is just so right.  In fact they were so amazed by the response by their fan base and by those for whom DSOFTM was a first PF purchase, that they began work on an album that contained sounds produced only by non-instruments (rubber bands, coffee cans, toilets etc) .  What ultimately happened was Wish You Were Here, in some ways an even better composition because the band was honest enough to admit that things in the music world were not that great after the huge success.  What I hear happening in Radiohead's latest two &quot;efforts&quot; KidA and Amnesia, is that perhaps the band was hoping something Floydish would happen.  But it hasn't and hopefully, what we're all witnessing here, is a bit of a limber and stretch period for the band before they can really push out the envelope once again.  If they can eventually pull off music that goes beyond OK Computer, then they will have their Wish You Were Here, but until then, I'm afraid they are hanging on as a band.  The next one will tell us clearly if Radiohead is a has been.  There are so many other talented artists doing the style they have recently engaged in with much more conviction and effort.
B000000OPU|5.0|I do not know enough about music to be able to write very much of style or intelligence about this album, but I know what I like.  This was one of the best albums to come out of the eighties, as far as I am concerned.  Fifteen years later, I still listen to it every chance I get...  A couple of the songs, specifically Sledgehammer and Big Time, are very high energy, but in general the mood of this album is peaceful, moody, and haunting.  Reading through the reviews on this page, I see that Peter Gabriel was/is very active in human rights, among other worthwhile causes...  If you want to find some way to support the guy, and get some fantastic music besides, you could do a lot worse than buying this album.  Two thumbs up.
B00001PE4D|5.0|Cruel Intentions is a good movie! That's why I gave it 5 stars... If you want to watch a movie filled with deceit and twisted plots, this is the one for you. Ryan Phillippe plays Sebastian. Sarah Michelle Gellar plays Kathryn, Sebastian's stepsister and love interest.  Sebastian derives pleasure out of others' misery.  Every girl that he comes in contact with is a conquest for him. He tries to get them in bed with him and will feed these girls any line needed to achieve his goal.<br />Kathryn is a &quot;psycho-bulimic-head case&quot; as described by her ex boyfriend.  Kathryn has a hard time dealing w/ rejection and wants to get back at anyone who does anything to her, nice or otherwise.  <br />Kathryn and Sebastian have their fun with flirting and foreplay until Sebastian wants a real challenge and finds out about Annette (played by Reese Witherspoon), a virgin from Kansas. Annette has recently written a manifesto on why she plans to wait..Sebastian doesn't like that and plans to prove her manifesto wrong.  <br />I'm not going to give away anything else about Katryn, Sebastain, Annette, or the others, such as Cecille and Ronald.  This movie is my favorite. Watch it, and you will find out why.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I have to be honest, at first I had no desire at all to see this movie.  I had seen the trailer a month prior one night at the movies and I thought to myself, what [jumk]  I was forced to see it by my friend.  How unbelievably happy I am that he made me go. Not only is this unlike anything you've ever seen, it's so amazingly beautiful in music as well.  I have seen so many movies in my life and nothing with ever compare.  Ewan sings like a god and Nicole brings new meaning to her craft.  She has a almost angelic voice and the music and the movie blend together so well it's breathtaking! This movie sucks the life from you and you become part of it and at the same time it is giving you the breath of life.  I cannot put it into words.  RUN to see this in its glory.  Do NOT listen to the critics they do not know what they are saying.  I only wished it was 3 hours longer and that they had sung more!  Maybe they can make a prequel!  Every movie maker out there should learn something about how to make a great movie by watching Moulin Rouge and all its wonderfulness. Bravo Baz!
B00001ZWBQ|5.0|Let's get a few things straight.  &quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot; by The Eagles is awesome.  However, &quot;One Night Only&quot; by the Bee Gees is on the same plateau.  People who don't appreciate the DTS quality simply don't know how to configure their systems properly.  Do you honestly believe that a group as big as the Bee Gees would put on a concert in Las Vegas and not hire the best audio technicians to produce their work?<br />If you truly love music - especially memorable melodies, then it doesn't get any better than this DVD.  The Brothers Gibb should be proud of the music they have made for nearly 40 years (as evidenced by the many musicians now in line to re-make some of their many hits).  The touching tribute to Andy Gibb and the performance by Celine Dion are the icing on the cake.  Buy this DVD now.  As a music lover, you won't regret it.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|O-MY-GOD! This is the best best movie! If I could give it more than 5 starts I would! BUT!!!...It's the kind of movie that you HAVE TO SEE ON THE BIG SCREEEN!!! YOU WILL WANT TO BUY IT!!!! Every one I talk to that has seen it say it is the best movie of the year!!...! You will cry, laugh, you will hate the bad guy!!!!!, this movie is everything!!...! I have seen it 2 times now, and I will go again, maybe even a 4th time!!!...
B00005BJ2O|2.0|Hmmm....aren't soundtracks supposed to be the tracks off the movie.....these aren't exactly what we heard....On top of it, the best songs are missing from the CD, we were so robbed! You know the money hungry bastards are doing this so they will make another CD and we will fork over more money... its BS, but we buy it....ANYWAY, it was a great GREAT movie, but a lousy or dissapointing &quot;soundtrack&quot;.
0141000198|4.0|I was sort of dragged to see this film the night it came out, but I ended up enjoying it immensely.  Of course, I had to buy the book next, and it kept me company on a long cross-country flight.  With all the humor of Nick Hornby, the self-deprecation of Woody Allen, and a plot borrowed from a classic, Fielding's narrative moves quickly and surely; always funny and ever-endearing, Bridget Jones's attempts to move from insecure singleness make for an engaging and hilarious read.<br />The humor of &quot;Bridget Jones's Diary&quot; is its strongest quality.  From the exchange between Bridget and her boss, Daniel, regarding the absence-due-to-sick-leave of Bridget's apparently too-short skirt, to the Tarts and Vicars fiasco, there's a lot to laugh at in this book. Fielding does funny well, but she's also good for a pithy rejoinder in the Cruelty Department; the American woman Bridget catches her man Daniel with says, as Bridget is leaving, &quot;I thought you said she was thin.&quot;  Ouch.<br />Some of the reviews here have bashed &quot;Bridget&quot; for ripping off Austen, which is a little unfair.  Rewrites like this are nothing new--see Jean Rhys' &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea,&quot; which updates &quot;Jane Eyre,&quot; or David Lodge's &quot;Nice Work,&quot; which does ditto for Gaskell's &quot;North and South,&quot; or Peter Carey's &quot;Jack Maggs,&quot; a skewed perspective on &quot;Great Expectations.&quot;  Fielding's contribution to this growing genre (the nineteenth-century rewrite) is more openly self-aware than some, and she allows herself and Bridget to have an awful lot of fun with &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; even pointing comically to other versions of this classic, like the BBC series.  I don't see this in the least as a detractor from one's enjoyment of &quot;Bridget Jones.&quot;<br />The one thing that does detract, for me, is the incessant inclusion, at the outset of every chapter, of updated data on Bridget's running battle with her weight and waistline.  There are occasional comic variations on the theme, but I felt, for the most part, that they were a distraction that I soon came to disregard.  Unlike the recipes that commence every chapter of Laura Esquivel's &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot; and have significant symbolic resonance throughout the chapter they introduce, Fielding's chapter-epigraphs in lbs. and calories don't seem to add much to the ongoing story.  (What's interesting is that Fielding apparently noticed this while writing the screenplay; in the film, she leaves them out after about the first five minutes, realizing that it was a trick that gets old fast.)  But that's not much to complain about.<br />Overall, I would recommend this book for its humor alone.  However, add to that comedy a fairly well-crafted plot that pokes fun at a classic while yet paying it homage and bringing it up to date, and you've got a great, fun read.  I totally enjoyed &quot;Bridget Jones's Diary&quot; and hope to read the sequel soon.
B00004Z459|4.0|I didn't expect this album to be as good as it actually is. I am not a hardcore metal fan but I do enjoy the much maligned Limp Bizkit and Papa Roach. This album consists of the searing guitar riffs of Brad Delson, sweet lyrics by Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda's rapping and sometimes quite good singing. Joseph Hahn also does a very good job on the turntables, making &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; a great mixture of rock and hip hop and a worthy addition to the nu-metal playground. <br />All of the songs are characterised by the haunting, angelic voice of vocalist Bennington, he manages to adapt his voice to some pretty eclectic numbers.The difference in songs such as &quot;Papercut&quot; and &quot;In The End&quot; is huge but Bennington  uses his brilliant voice to great effect to create a fantastic partnership with MC Shinoda. Shinoda is not about to become the Wu-Tang Clan's 37th member but his lyrics are fast and have an edge, they mix perfectly with both the music and Bennington's voice. Brad Delson's guitar sound is as I have mentioned huge and he creates a fantastic background sound to the lyricists' singing. Delson also played Bass for this album and is a testament to his talent with a guitar, they have finally sorted out the problem by getting a seperate bass player; some bloke called &quot;Phoenix.&quot; <br />All of the songs are good, some more so than others. look out for &quot;Papercut,&quot; &quot;With You,&quot; &quot;Crawling&quot; and &quot;A Place For My Head.&quot; These are very good songs catching all aspects of the band's characteristics; melody, hard edged rapping and loud music. There are some slightly dodgy songs, &quot;In The End&quot; features an out of place piano, &quot;Cure For The Itch&quot; is a track which Hahn has all to himself, while the final song &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot; is very much an end-of-album track. Generally, &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; is a very good piece of production that pumps out radio-friendly songs all of whichhave suburban skater kid edge.Yet the criticisms I have are of the quite formulated pattern that the album follows, guitar riffs, some rapping, some mixing and some sweet lyrics. The lyrics are slightly pretentious; angry young men letting off steam about life, yet the lack of any real bite (I am not advocating swearing though) creates a sense of consumer orientated maketing.  If you are into the deftones, Rage or (hed)pe this is not really for you unless you want music that is easy to listen to, not thought provoking, undisturbing and actually quite excellent!
B00005BL2A|5.0|I decided this week to buy this CD despite the average rate of 3.5 stars that it has so far. After having listened to it more than 10 times, I only wonder what has been the problem with all the &quot;underraters&quot;... Songs like &quot;Dream on&quot;, &quot;Shine&quot;, &quot;Freelove&quot; or &quot;When the body speaks&quot; are just among the best songs that they have ever written. &quot;I feel loved&quot; is the most perfect single since &quot;Violator&quot;, and &quot;Goodnight lovers&quot; is the most endearing lullaby I have ever heard. If you love MUSIC, if you love FEELING, if you are not clogged up in the past, you will absolutely LOVE this exciting album. No song will dissapoint you if you just let yourself free and feel the music. Congratulations to you guys of DM, you have done it again!!
B00000016V|5.0|This concluding Doors album is one of their best. Be it in the catchy'Love Her Madly' or the more bluesy numbers such as 'Cars Hiss By My Window' and 'Crawling King Snake', the title track is an amazing rock 'n roll tour de force. This album is a must for any decent record collection. Due to Morrison's excessive drinking his voice is more hoarse and gravelly on this album which adds to its bluesy feel. The album does not have as much of a mystic feel as their previous efforts and is predominantly a blues album. There is a distinct plaintive sound in such songs as 'Hyacinth House' bringing a sense of ominousness to the album. The final song on the album 'Riders on the Storm' leaves the listener with a slight eerie feeling, as Morrison sings 'into this world we're thrown...like a dog without a bone' he is asserting the age of anxiety, in which man, no longer able to sustain faith in religion is left to ponder existense alone. This seems a fitting conclusion to a great album and an extraordinary rock band.
B00000FCBC|5.0|This is an album filled with one of the most influetnial metal bands ever playing their influences. Even thuogh so what is somewhat of a &quot;nasty&quot; song there are tons of awsome songs. They cover every one from Sabbath, the Blue Oyster Cult to Motorhead. I though the album is a must buy for metal heads. I being a musician and all find all of these covers excellent. Some i think are better than the orignals. So i say BUY THIS
078401020X|4.0|Yes it is famous for the sex. But really, Paul Verhoeven has created an excellent modern Hitchcock yarn.  Cheesy at times and overdone at others nevertheless Verhoeven and his cameraman Jan de Bont have done really great things.  Steady cam work is brilliant and the dance club scene pulses with more energy and sexuality than any of the nudity crammed scenes in the film.  Overlook the surface and you'll find a layered film made with great skill.
B00003CWMI|1.0|This is an interesting film, so this will take a while.  My brother's name is Andrew Martin Hunter.<br />This is a wonderful San Francisco movie.  The city does not overwhelm the story, but is a perfect nest for the action.  Good choice and good job!<br />Similarly, the effects enhance the film, and do not overwhelm and choke the story being told, which is why we are seeing this movie in the first place.  There are plenty of Mork and Mindy reruns if you want to see Williams preform!<br />ROBIN WILLIAMS:  I have a hard time seeing the character of Andrew through Robin Williams, sin Williams (call him &quot;W&quot;?) is such a strong personality.  I have to ask myself if this movie could this film stand alone with out Robin Williams.  I think it could, it is just theat Williams has the name draw, along with Asimov, so they had him do it.  Robin Williams got in the way of the story, though not intentionally.  He is so strong and such a high-pressure personality that I don;t think he can help it.  Plus the several wise-cracks which are a shadow of the comedian Williams.<br />THEME:  This is a story of humanity by studying a contrast.  If this seems familiar, it is a leitmotif of Lt. Cmdr. Data on Star Trek: The Next Generation.  I watched the film to see if they did anything fresh or new.  They didn't . . . except for the suicide.  I think you could piece this film together from fragments of the TV series and First Contact.  Indeed, Star Trek has treated this theme so well, there is a book called &quot;The Metaphysics of Star Trek: Is Data Human?&quot; which covers this whole ground.  See episode 135 &quot;The Measure of A Man.&quot;<br />I saw the film as having two conclusions about humanity.<br />CONCLUSION 1: Meaning of humanity is sex.  This is absolutely laughable.  Andrew Martin becomes a human, and has sex. ...  Egad!  So the point of humanity is sex.  Is heaven found at the red-light district, and is God's name &quot;Roxanne?&quot;  Is Bill Clinton the most enlightened human on earth?  Why my grandmother was dying of Alzheimer's disease, my grandfather has a sexless life.  So was he missing something, or did he find something in nurturing my grandmother, feeding her, dressing and bathing her, and so forth?  The Bible says that God is love, not that God is sex!<br />CONCLUSION 2: Suicide is an option.  Aside from being just a change of scenery, suicide is the ultimate choice.  We can not unscramble that egg.  We talk about life being precious and full and rich, yet there are some people who do not see it as such.  We want to respect choices and we all feel pain, but we also have obligations to others and to society.  We are all needed somewhere,a nd suicide pulls us out of the pool of helping hands.<br />Back to my Grandmother.  It cost [money]  to keep her alive, and took all of my grandfather's time to tend her.  A lethal injection of Kevorkian Juice cost [less].  Physician assisted suicide is less about pain, and more about money.  If we stop caring about the dying, we will lose feeling about the living.<br />I wonder what Mr. Williams's opinion is about suicide.  He did a marvelous anti-suicide film, &quot;What Dreams May Come,&quot; yet he does this pro suicide film.  You can see why hypocrite was originally a theatrical term.<br />Well, this was not one of my favorite films.  I think star Trek did a better job with the themes.  Also, read Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game series, and watch Jane!ightened human on earth?  Why my grandmother was dying of Alzheimer's disease, my grandfather has a sexless life.

B000056N8X|5.0|Say what you will ... and the legions of Connor fans will doubtless disagree with me ... but Endgame shows the *only* way that the Highlander series could possibly continue, and handles that continuance with grace and dignity.  The DVD contains an alternate version of the ending (same idea, less the odd morphing), just in case you think there might be a different outcome than you saw in the theatres.  I cried in the theatre, and I cry when I re-watch this marvelous addition to the Highlander canon.
B000002GQE|3.0|Maybe it's because I'm not writing this in the sixties, but every time I listen to this CD I can't help but think that it's a bunch of guys who got a bit carried away and full of themselves.  When one reads the liner notes you realize that that's not so, but the sound comes across that way anyway.  It's an interesting concept, as it attempts to describe the moods of a day, and in many places it works.  &quot;Peak Hour&quot; does have the frentic pace it is describing, and &quot;Forever Afternoon (Tuesday?)&quot; describes the lull of a routrine workaday life in most of its essence.  However, there is too much of the infinitely unnecessary poetry of &quot;The Day Begins&quot; and its companion poem following &quot;Nights in White Satin,&quot; all of which is coupled with truly unremarkable symphonic attempts.  I criticized the poetry trailing &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot; above, but I make no disparagements of the track itself.  &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot; so perfectly captures a sultry night that a triviality such as the poetry bit is hardly distracting.  In fact, as a purist, I recommend the album version with the poetry instead of the sans-poetry single version.  Sure, it's pretentious, but that is what they were trying to do, so what the hell.
0553583182|4.0|I do like the book and think it could help just about anyone.  Some parts are a little &quot;iffy&quot; such as reading the contents of a sealed envelope using your subconscious, stuff like that you have to take with a grain of salt.<br />The first time I read the book here's how I used it.  I was on an airplane and they were serving wine.  I guess I was in business class or something.  Anyway, the wine was good and the flight attendent came around with a second pouring.  As she was getting nearer to my turn, I asked myself how I could get her to pour me more than a half glass full.  The answer came back to me from my subconscious.  As she was pouring, I imperceptively lowered my glass away from the bottle (she kind of rested the bottle on the glass while she was pouring for stability).  She instinctively tipped the bottle to keep it on the glass and voila!  My glass was full of wine.  It was funny because it took me a few minutes to realize that I had just tapped into my subconscious mind to find a solution, and it was the perfect solution.<br />To tap your subconscious, most people say you have to hold an image in your mind until your subconscious accepts it as fact.  I personally find that I get better results when I just flat out ask myself questions like &quot;how can I get, how can I achieve, how can I obtain...&quot; a certain thing, no matter if it is a physical object or an action or a reaction, whatever.  Then wait for the answer.  Then test the answer, sometimes the real answer is the exact opposite of the first answer that pops into your mind.  So when you get an answer ask yourself &quot;OK what is the exact opposite of that answer?&quot;  And then use your conscious mind to rationalize between the two solutions.
0930289234|5.0|Some might &quot;Watchmen,&quot; written by comics god Alan Moore, a bible in the field of graphic novels.  These people, myself included are absolutely right.  This book has it all: politicial satire, classic science fiction themes, and a thought provoking message.  &quot;Watchmen&quot; is a book that really makes you think and after just a few pages, you're completely sucked in.  I should know, I was the same way.  Please do yourself a favor and pick up &quot;Watchmen&quot; today.
B00003CXRO|5.0|Rare is it that an actor with such talent as Tom Hanks could convincingly portray four different characters in one film with so many realistic and underlying messages. Here, he portrays man who is a workaholic who has very little time for the precious things in life, such as his relationship with his girlfriend. He is a company man who pushes aside many things to get his job done. Once shipwrecked, he becomes the learner and survivor, who now is educating himself about himself and the environment. He experiences loss of human contact, friendship, loved ones, and his own failures. As the years pass, he now plays a survivor, who has mastered each day, and creates his own world of friendship. Upon his return to civilization, his final portrayal is that of all three people, and the addition of a fourth, who now must deal with loss of love, time, and the inevitable reality of being directionless with many directions to embark upon. This is such a parallel artform to many individuals each day who suffer such trials of loss, be it in divorce, death, or employment. Each moral of this wonderful story applies to our lives. Hanks outdoes himself as an actor, idealist, and a human being.
