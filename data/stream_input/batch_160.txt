B0023VIFQ0|4|Great price and great fit but my headlight was missing a bulb for the blinker
B000N3W8J0|5|fits well in a 5 gal bucket and leaves the dirt below the working water line,  I would buy again
B0042Z0XWY|1|Gotten mix up different item
B00VB2OH2I|5|Much better than I expected.. Although,,, shipping threw Amazon was a bit of an ordeal.... No one pays attention to instructions on shipping..
B00GWQA9JS|5|All I got to say is wow! This thing is nice and high quality for a great price. I used it for my SYE kit on a 99 xj and fit like a glove.
B0073ZG45K|5|I love this lanyard! The price and quality is great and it's so silky soft.
B00NDZNDL2|5|Looks awesome under the Pantera logo
B00NFFXVRG|5|They look great on my chevy trax and the key chain is awesome
B0041RPGQ6|5|I use this mainly for my lower back pain on long drives, and this product definitely does the trick!  I've had it about 10 months or so, and have been very happy with it. Used it everyday in the winterto warm up, and from time to time in the summer when I have a flare up. Heats up very quickly, and you can't beat the price!
B003WGUAJA|5|Use these for car washing and detailing. Work great for all detailing jobs from washing paint to interior detailing and wax pickup. Will get more to add to my microfiber rotation.
B00RUQLTRA|5|Good experience.
B00A9WWL6U|4|works well plug and play
B00E2556BM|4|I bought this to use on some bison leather boots and it works well.  The instructions say to apply several thin coats rather than one thick coat.  I try to apply two coats at a time rather than several because it would take half the bottle to do several.  The leather absorbs the lotion well and removed some light scratches that were present.  The bottle is fairly small but if you apply a couple of light coats at a time and deem this sufficient, it should last awhile.
B000WGCWIU|4|I love having this because I love saving money on the purchase of batteries.  I've had this for some time and it still works really well!  I purchased this for use with my portable tens machines.  It's small enough that I can take it with me when I travel.  I did lose the original charging cord but was able to use a similar watt one without a problem.
B0002RNTSG|4|Works as advertised, and is very useful
B000P17NXQ|5|I have had several brake controller but this one is amazing. All my other ones are in a box on a shelf, and this one I use in both my trucks. I bought an extra mount and just transfer it over to the truck I'm using at that time. It saves your retailer presets also.
B010R32L3I|5|This first car I tried CAR- SHOW 1 on was my 2001 Subaru Outback. This is a daily driver and the paint has faded some over the years. The kit made it easy to use as it is all in one box. The product went on with ease. The added plus was that it brightened the paint to more like the original color.<br />The car looks new again. The next car I tried it on was my classic 1969 Camaro SS Convertible. This car was painted over 20 years ago. I wanted to see if after applying CAR-SHOW 1, it cut down down on my time spent on detailing in the future. Not only did it cut the time for detailing, but the detailing spray I was using seems to glide on and off much easier. When I took the car to a recent car show, someone asked me if I had the car painted recently. I explained it was just CAR-SHOW 1. Great protection for my paint and a great shine! Five stars and two thumbs up for CAR-SHOW 1.
B00UHD4HJA|5|Some people said there weren't any skateboard/snowboard stickers but they are stickers you put on your skateboards or snowboards they are not of them... So yeah but i got mine for my laptop and I love love love them so $6.20 well spent !!
B000KKLLFS|5|Inexpensive and convenient replacement for car and bicycle valves that needed to be replaced
B000CMF4UM|5|The '15 GT application was not listed anywhere online when I ordered these, but Gorilla had it and so did Amazon.  Way better than the &#34;long&#34; style McGard set that Ford sells at the parts counter.
B00JLJWIB0|5|The quality I received for these are very good. The bottom's of the mats are thick and there are ridges that protrude out of them to help them from moving around. The only thing I did't like was the large staples that held them together. The Colors on the blue set were very vibrant and after having this set for over a year and a half they are still just as vibrant. Over time they have gotten slightly raggedy from use but I can still see the design clearly on the mats. I've washed them twice as which makes me even more surprised about how they have held up!
B00AM1Z67O|5|I've only used it two times but it seems to do a good job.
B00TYZLH1I|2|Seems to work fine; however, it is a bitch to get seated (it's a roll-out). Better it it been the stiff-type (two or three panel).
B001CF3IZ6|1|Sucked! This thing didn't even come close to fitting in my cj5. Now I have a hundred dollars piece of junk laying in my basement!
B004EK94P4|2|Thought they were reflective. I should have paid better attention...My fault!
B00ID94XCG|5|Excellent product shipped fast also
B00LMY1YJ4|4|Works like a charm and at a great price
B000BWE3DW|3|It works well, when it works. I've had this ignition in my 67 Mustang 302 for couple of years. It went bad again. This will make number 3, but for 200$ Its worth it.
B0010Z4MDK|4|Fit perfect, fast shipping!
B0023VKXT2|5|Worked perfectly!
B0077FIKTE|5|Fits and works great
B00VGL7Z5A|5|Works well.
B000BO9NOO|3|I tried fixing a little ding its okay
B011SQ7FFC|5|Ok,on time good thanks!
B000JFL7ZS|4|good product from lisle
B000COB5BM|5|Perfect for avoiding having to replace your whole lower radius arm if you shear off the lower shock mount stud.
B001QD27SI|4|I have owned this beaded seat for 8+ years. I am on my second one.  If you have cloth seats this thing is great. Keeps your butt from overheating on long rides as well as relieving that butt stress you get from long drives.  I will never be without 1.  I drive a lot and really love it.  Owned 1 as a field engineer, logging 100,000 miles a year.
B009NMH70M|4|The cover appears to be very well made and it fit the seat on my '71 C20 tightly.  The seat belt holes were slightly misplaced but, that should be expected with a universal product.  I would definitely buy this seat cover again.
B004GHUUB2|5|Excellant product fast delivery alli expected
B001MP2V9K|4|Very happy with item as it fit perfect and matched other lens in color. The only problem I had was the bulb for the brakes didn't work. I just used my old one.
B00276U4T2|4|The screws hold fine if you use a tiny bit of loctite to them first. I put this on my 05 Chevy cavalier and it functions just fine, but due to this being a universal knob, it does have some play towards the top..perhaps including some kind of rubber space filler that goes between the shaft and the knob, included with the knob to eliminate the wiggle would be an idea.
B00DV1D3K4|5|excellent
B007FHHEVO|5|well what can I say It works , i got it fast , not much else really to say .
B004A6GQ0I|5|Perfect fit  t

B002R0R9HI|5|Great service and fit. Would and have recommended to anyone.
B0017LIC88|5|Really nice exhaust had old exhaust off and new dual exhaust on in 1- hour, was installed on a 2007 Toyota Tundra 5.7 sounds real good would buy again
B000W1R1J0|5|Looks to have most needed items
B0006H93FA|3|Tried this first as per the directions but didn't seem to work.  Followed that treatment with Dawn dish washing soap and that did it.  3 stars because I don't know if the Dawn would have done it alone.  Next time I'll try Dawn first
B00KLIWMCU|2|Hard to stay in the window at times with the sun visors.
B00E6WG5MA|5|Excellent came quick fit right on no issues.Thankyou boys where excited came so quick.
B001GC645G|5|pic showed one pin I received both pins
B00MY99IXA|1|Fell apart on first use.
B00EPA7BXU|5|It´s nice.
B001C6OYC6|5|Easy installation, great fit.
B00ML1D1PW|1|Terrible product.  Magnets suck.  First use on a small trailer, they came off, smashed on the road and are now useless.  They lasted 400 yards...DONT BUY
B0046ID5EK|5|looks like enough people said enough. worked like a charm best $8 ever spent and it even came with a new battery!!
B000I4JPZE|5|Did not use it I hope I never have to but I know people that have it word as expected
B000C8T8B2|4|Good quality
B0038AXDEY|2|I bought these and I thought they looked great on my truck.  I have had these on my truck for almost one year.  They developed moisture on the first day of use and it has only gotten worse.  I live in the dry central valley of California and I should not have moisture in my headlights.  I am returning these on the one year warranty.  They also do not emit as much light as the factory installed headlights.
B002HTXR7K|5|Fit perfectly and installation took less than one minute.
B0018ICAMO|4|GOOD VALUE.
B0057FUE18|5|Perfect fast shipping great price
B00FS66ZW8|2|JUNK !!
B00KN282X2|5|worked great on my Porsche cayenne 22&#34; wheels!
B000C9QQSE|5|great
B00KFV8N9O|5|Thank you
B00M6H9128|4|Didn't fit my Hyundai Tucson 2015 cup holders and after you cut then to the line theres no way back and they are now too small but still protects the bottom. Was my bad on that part, for not trying up while cutting the pieces out, will get another one, im a discreet fan when it comes to cars. lol Great quality, looks like the picture with hard but flexible rubber texture.
B000O0B078|5|As time goes by I didn't notice how stiff the gear selector was getting.  I had an issue about a year ago where it would not go into park or drive very easily which turned out to be two loose screws on the arm that connects to the cable in the steering column.  But I think the real cause of the problem was this.  Very easy to change and now the shifter goes from gear to gear with minimal effort for my 2000 Ford Explorer.
B00407YPAU|5|I used this to paint a replacement door handle on my sister in laws car.  It matched perfectly after I sprayed it with a clear coat.
B002UQGR5E|4|Well made but tends to move a little on the carb.  Have to adjust it from time to time
B00J6DQNVC|5|Perfect fit for my 2003 Silverado. Truck appears to be running more smoothly now.
B00020CAVA|5|I used this to wrap a copper sink that had no noise dampening materials. This product worked perfectly. It was very easy to install and it holding up very well. Highly recommended for this application.
B00DKREM2W|5|Great product and customer service! The rear tint piece had a little damage to it but they immediately replaced it for me and I messed up the passenger side window but so they created a special listing forme so iI could fix it. The tint went on nicely and looks professional I'm very happy with the product but keep in mind this is tedious work and you need to take your time with it and get a heat gun for best results.
B000JFL8RK|5|Just what I need to get my machine up and running.
B00NGGKNO8|5|it was the great
B002PQJ9H2|4|a good buy for the price
B00KTJ0A0C|5|Easy to setup and works perfectly
B004GE6KMI|5|Worked well on my 1998 Ford Expedition.  Installation was straight forward.  Took about 5 minutes.
B002T4U0BY|5|Good shock at a good price
B0013ERRSK|4|I use this when I take my dog to the dog park here in town.  I need more water than the 20oz bottle I used to use. This works great....  the only thing I'm cranky about is the water level is too low after some use.  Its great when I get to the dog park, but after a several drinks....... the darn level gets down to where the dogs kind of give up using it.   Propping up one end helps some... but it ain't ideal.   It STILL holds more water than any bottle.
B00VF0OSFC|1|I NEVER USE THE PRODUCT , I GAVE A CHARGE IN BATTERY. IN DISPLAY IS SAID BATTERRY  99 % CHARGED AND THE LIGHT NOT TURN ON. I TRY RETURN THE EQUIPMENT AND I HAD INFORMATION THE TIME IS CLOSED TO RETURN.
B00IABG8OI|5|I installed on a 1993 motorhome. fit a Duo perfect. Could have cut the bottom 1 1/2 in lip off bottom for lower fit, but worked just fine.
B001GJ3FIS|4|Works great except for jet stream not strong enough
B0008FUHWI|4|as described
B00FWLFFJS|5|cool product.
B00I5RXN7C|5|Fantastic lights, I will be ordering more for my work van!  You can even replace the rear cargo van light in the fords (at rear) with no modifications, It screws right into the existing holes!
B002ZTM8ZY|5|Very good fit I would recommend this product.
B000NVW1LM|5|I have a 2003 BMW 745-I, along with the prestige goes hi- dollar repairs. When I bough the car I read some of the FLAWS inherent in this vehicle. One is a constant oil leak behind the water pump. It's a major repair, in excess of $1000.00 I accidently  saw a video on you tube. This mechanic had 20 years of experience, he swears by this stuff ( At-205 Re-Seal) Like one guy said, I don't believe in snake oil. So what's  the worst that can happen. I bought 2 bottles, the BMW oil pan holds like 8 quarts of oil. I added 1 1/2 bottles of this stuff. I  Made a 200 mile business trip.No s_ _ t, no leaks. I mean I was loosing quite a bit of oil. I had a 24&#34; x 48&#34; piece of cardboard under the car, and in 2 days it was 50% soaked.<br />I think I spent under $20.00, I am very, very  pleased
B000BZG96I|5|Installed sensor and it works great.
B00FBQKSFK|1|No sticker in packaging, DON't BUY!!!! 👎🏼
B001V8UKBY|5|Great Value, Used it already to change tires on the camper.
B00N4OHVOW|5|Brighter than original light
B00BK7LR36|4|It worked great. Running much smoother.  And better accelerator response. Great product in my book.
B00B4S2IM0|5|Fits my 2010 Tacoma perfect and they look great
B00Y4GX3UA|3|OK quality.
B000OP6KLY|5|Best Fikter and the oil
B00TYZLH1I|5|Wife loves it. Fits great
B00168V1RG|1|The two carriage bolts are the wrong size, and there should be a second set of mounting holes and bolts to keep the brackets from vibrating over. I will have to buy hardware, and drill extra holes.
B00FS0WF82|5|Small, but works well.  As advertised
B00LMIO8M0|5|Hard to find item. I am building a 1/25 scale VW bus and it will have a Corvair motor.
B005IGSOTK|5|Gas cap cover fits nice and tight and eliminates the glare I was getting in the windshield.
B002EWP4AS|5|After installing and driving for last two months, this steering wheel makes my 2001 Camry a joy to drive.  I can feel the response of the steering and the road more.  Got a deal for $129 on Amazon because it was listed as slightly used. When I received it, only the screws were missing and it was brand new still. Luckily I had extra Allen screws .
B0016KFY0O|5|Does the job nicely
B005DOQYOO|5|Awesome in the rain or night driving. My eyes are light sensitive and these are perfect.
B00DM8N93M|5|kool
B0026XFBC6|5|Delivery was delayed by weather conditions.  Decal was as expected and is now installed on the back fender of my CanAm Spyder.
B0082365AQ|3|Had to re engineer it to make it useable. Saw another one bought at a big bucks store was identical but cost 60.00 bucks. And they both had the same problem of folding up at the wrong time.
B00EUUNJRM|3|Gets moisture in the light bar
B0009JRVWC|3|Fit just fine exact replacement but then again, the first one stripped out.... Like I said it's exactly the same, no improvement.
B000BWCG90|2|Radiator hose will NOT fit a standard radiator hose.  Tried to get it to fit on my daughters 2002 Mustang with NO luck.  Actually, myself, my father (former mechanic), and my neighbor all tried.  I have used engine dress up kits before (won a car show back &#34;in the day&#34; and this product just fails.
B00PIDWJ1C|5|Took a long time to get them but they are as describe and they feel nice on my hands.
B00JZF9KES|5|Installed it in my camper and it's working great.
B009SANM7Q|5|Great product! Installed on 2005 gmc 3500. Stablized ride with large Lance camper.
B0080JBZN4|5|Great set of tools for the price.
B0006GF5SK|5|arrived on time, these are the easiest way to keep your rv holding tank fresh, no messy liquids to deal with just drop a tab in the pot and your done
B00KPR3NL6|1|This item is not in stock from this seller.<br />The manufacturer has discontinued the number 30069
B00K35QC5E|5|Working perfectly
B00I9IOG8W|5|great fit for the truck but center seat belt and cup holder cant be used with this seat unless you modify cover
B00TP0I210|5|Excellent fit. Easy installation
B000FPZX5W|3|For some reason, this kit only comes with the grade 8 bolts to fasten the L-brackets to the floor with mounting backer plates but no screws & nuts to attach the belts to the L-brackets.  This is nuts!  Quality of items included is great but how about sell me a complete kit so I don't have to run out to Lowe's to finish the project!
B0000AY6AC|5|good sealant
B00D0IA5TU|5|Did not fit my 63 Nova
B00HVMQHVQ|4|Really hard to master! A terrific product but I was so awkward trying to dip a drop of<br />Solution into powder stir, scoop and fill a crack. I will try it again if I find a little tool for stirring , scooping and smoothing.
B00RW4LM18|5|great
B002MCVPOO|5|Tool works as advertised. Saves a ton of time.
B00NGOY54E|5|Perfect fit & match. Extremely installation!
B00VJWZD1Y|5|Kyb strut plus are the bomb. Easy to install on my honda and brought the ride hight back up. 172000 mi on the vehicle and with the new struts it feels like brand new.
B00QHA3356|5|Really useful.
B00ZXA8C52|5|Bright and well focused. Got it for my harley works great
B00VAVSDDO|5|Car drives great now
B0053JJDGA|4|headers fit but bolt holes had to be slotted slightly for bolts to align in heads
B00QWTECHK|5|Great easy to install looks good.
B00FJJZLXS|5|fits right in and work like a champ
B002N5L9R8|5|Everything was as described for this kit. It did fit the item we needed for! A happy customer!
B005DTT6LM|5|I Love my poodle decal!! I just do! So many people have come up to me and asked me where did I get it? That is looks beautiful and that it looks so real. To be honest I was a bit worried that the decal was going to be smaller or bigger but no,  it was just perfect. I loved it.  It was so easy to install. In the envelope in which the decal comes the company also puts in instructions on how to install it. If you still can't still figure it out,  go to their FB page and they have a video explaining how to do it. That help me more. By the way, I do have a miniature poodle. ;) Anyway I have no regrets here. Just a happy customer. Thank You
B00062ZDFY|5|Great just like O.E.M.
B001F01EG8|5|Love it very strong build
B000RXKR6M|5|Got this when I got a new car and wanted to keep the paint/clearcoat in as great shape as possible. I've had this for two years now and it has held up very well. Only problem I've had was that it picked up some tar that had gotten stuck to the bottom of my bumper, so I had to cut off a bit of it. It's still doing fine but I will probably replace it soon.
B006X152SU|5|Just what I needed. Great on the back of my Fatboy.
B006N94O5E|4|Fit perfect, same length so I counted threads. Will have alignment checked but seems good. I like the grease zero. All 5 except it is made in China.
B00GLLW3AM|3|Not as bright as I hoped, but I decided to use them as porch lights on my TEARDROP CAMPER
B000JFJLP6|5|Love this charger
B0093AA1CK|5|This fits my 2014 T& C windshield perfectly.  It is sturdy and a better quality than any of the ones I have used in the past for my other vehicles.  It rolls up to a decent size but usually gets stored in the back because of its shape.
B001NOXFEU|5|First HVLP gun and it works great. I sprayed car paint on a boat both color and then clear. It took only a few adjustments to get this dialed in for a great finish. Really happy.
B00TQHHCTK|5|Works very well
B003UVCY00|5|Works very well.  Thanks.
B0062WC9IQ|1|Only lasted a week before starting to continually turn over in bike.thought I had a short so took my bike into dealer had it looked at. Sure enough soilinod was gone already. Only rode bike 2 times on it.
B003HIPBJM|5|Used to shield boat motor cable wire harness. Protects it well.
B005LDBELA|5|Great for my keys. Sturdy construction, pink color is bright and nice.
B00J4HAXE8|5|These lights are superb quality and are ULTRA BRIGHT.  I use them as additional headlights.  They may need to be aimed down however as they are spot beams.  I recommend this brand to anyone looking for excellent lights at a great price.  No moisture noticed after two months.
B000C2Y6NI|2|Fits very loose on a 2.2 Ecotech engine. Replaced with the oem AC Delco which fits tightly.
B00BITKUUM|5|1 minute is all it takes to install this and works perfect for a small fraction of the price autopart stores wanted
B00F9RNIPI|5|Cant be beat for the price.  High quality
B00842A7F4|5|good price
B004LWVEKS|5|Great item!<br />I've spent some money over the years getting various trickle chargers, and they did nothing for me. This unit is hooked up to my motor home where I constantly keep 2 engine batteries constantly charged while we are not traveling. I purchased the extra lighter plug in charge attachment, and instead of attaching this under my motor home, I simply plug it in to the electrical in the motor home and then to the lighter accessory and WALLAH, it charges. I run the motor home once a month to keep the liquids etc flowing and I don't disconnect the charger, it wont hurt it if you want to run your engine while its hooked up.
B00A14QNP6|5|Part was perfect. Processing order was fast and very timely shipping. very pleased.
B00QN8DMHQ|4|Nice quality vanity plate.
B002R0N8BY|5|Good replacement part very simple installation
B00CXAEDEO|4|Good overall product. It seems that the switch does not work in all positions.
B002Z64P4Y|5|Works great
B0009IQZFM|5|Love this towel, will buy more for sure.<br /><br />Great for quick detailing/rinseless washes.<br /><br />Update: F***ING (Y) on the badge of my camrY ripped some of the threads out. Debadging soon. Also dries entire car with just two towels, leaves no streaks.
B00HR5TBEM|5|Thanks
B00AQ3AI08|5|Fit perfectly. Install was a piece of cake. Make sure and get the correct interior color code and you should not have a problem.
B00AQKRZYI|5|Perfect fit for our 2012 Suburban.  Super easy to clean.  Couldn't be happier.
B00EKKJ9E4|4|Warm white light appears similar to original incandescent bulbs in my sailboat cabin light fixtures (1141).  This bulb is polarity sensitive which in my case required reversal of the positive and negative wires.  The outer part of the bulb needs to be connected to negative and the center to positive.  I have purchased other LED lights that are not polarity sensitive and are rated for a wider voltage range but they are twice the price of these bulbs.
B00404ZDAO|5|I thought it would be a bit bulkier, but it's slim and trim and not too heavy for my ignition. My Jeep is black on black, so my pink accent is just what I was looking for.
B00449DYDS|5|Easy installation. No rust anywhere so far.
B000JZ33H8|5|Option One)Relay   Pop old Flasher Relay off and replace with this.  Or  Option two)Resistors    Open the package of resistors and figure how to install, remove light fixtures, trace  wire that goes to the blinker, splice into wire, Protect new connections as to prevent any shorts, find a safe location to mount the crazy hot resistors, put everything back together, and finally hope everything is good to go.  In less than a minute I found my Flasher Relay.  Turn on your turn signals so you can hear and feel it clicking when you reach under. On 2005 F150 the relay is located below the steering wheel right above Brake pedal. No disassembly required.  I replaced all my lights with LEDs, although I liked the &#34;Hyper Flash&#34; I didn't like getting attention from the cops( twice ) thinking I have a burnt out bulb.
B00LIDY5HW|4|Arrived as described and is super cute. Can't complain for the price. Even though it is plastic ( wish it was made of stronger material) there hasn't been any issues and it seems sturdy enough.
B007IIWER4|3|The u-bolt appears well made, it lost 2 stars becasuse the picture shows TWO bolts but only one arrived. I was too trusting this time.
B000SNBSMI|1|First time I used it the rain went right through it and my motorcycle was soaking wet. Looks like it's only good for keeping the sun off.
B00KLKYO60|5|work and fit well
B000VU91SG|5|Love it fits as supposed to ,will see how it holds up to use
B00GG9FBJ4|5|This product really works.
B00KCI61FS|5|i love them... they are awesome...
B0002SR7TC|5|its good and fast
B00077ZDUS|5|Worked perfectly with the CURT 1339 receiver hitch to attach my 1 1/4&#34; two bike rack.  Finish appears to be durable and even all over.
B000UKB6VW|5|Great filter
B00S75EJCK|5|Love it
B00JIEX722|5|I just installed these replacing my stock licence plate lights on my 2007 Infiniti G35X sedan. These lights are super bright with a hid look and give the car a even more high end luxury look
B00C80HQCK|3|to small but works ok will have to get a bigger light
B001GC2LVM|5|Made everything easier. Work great.<br />We didn't need a cord of wood to get our trailer level.
B009DJT0AK|5|Works just like it is supposed to.
B00DMTZKWO|1|The emblem was horrible so I bought a real jdm altezza emblem to replace it and the the grill it self doesn't clip into the bumper properly so I find myself always having to pull the grill back into place
B0040CRTK8|5|Good
B001GJ3FIS|3|It works great although it does leak...which does seem to be common with these types of nozzles.
B00FWOKKGI|4|Very nice light bar for the price. Installed on my son's blazer, he loves it. VERY BRIGHT LIGHT!!!!
B00E5OUOCQ|5|This product is great! I have a large suv and it fits great and we'll made too!
B00B0C2O9W|5|Fits my 1997 GMC Suburban! Great brakes..will buy again!
B008FV91KQ|5|bought for my mom and she loves it! fits well!
B000CAINEI|2|they didn't fit my 3 car windows, look like a great product jumbo was to wide for bmw 5 series, Acura TL, and Honda prelude which were all listed as cRs it would fit. Go figure.
B0015DMJ2S|5|Exceptional buy and very sturdy and reliable
B00N4K5VB6|5|Looks much better than stock and fits perfectly! Highly recommend this especially if you have a black bike. Oh also, laid bike down and held up much better than stock peg.
B001KSE0Y8|5|Has worked great so far and you can't beat the price!  Came with some mounting tape but we also added some extra outdoor mounting tape as a precaution.  My mechanic had told me I would have to purchase and whole new mirror assembly.
B000TYHQ18|5|Awesome! perfect! A1 service.
B000CB1MDG|5|Fit perfectly on an 85' MR2 (AW11). It goes on much easier than the driver's side boot. I recommend putting the boot on over the inner tie rod, putting a bit of lubricant on the end of the boot, and then turning the steering wheel all the way to the right. This will compress the boot and push it onto the steering rack lip that it needs to sit on.<br /><br />The zip ties that come with the boot will not make the usual click sound as you tighten them, and there is no way to loosen them. I recommend waiting until you have the boot fully on before putting the zip tie on and tightening it.
B000CM0WD6|5|Fits perfect on my 1991 samurai
B000IYSKAK|5|Fit perfect in my 2003 Ram 1500 Quad Cab 4x4
B00L40ESW6|5|Smells really good can really smell it when in your car not like the ones you buy in a store that last a day or two. Last a long time.
B00387HT6U|5|Worked perfectly on my son's '94 explorer Sport. No issues.
B00KWP9SM4|4|VERY GOOD PRODUCT AS ALWAYS VANCE AND HINES, VERY ACCOMPLISHED SELLER I RECEIVED MY PRODUCT BEFORE I EXPECTED
B000CHLDLQ|5|Worked perfectly on my son's '02 Malibu. No issues.
B00VFCG3CQ|5|A++++
B004LGUP5Y|5|Worked perfectly on my son's '94 Explorer Sport. No issues.
B00H3QT6B8|5|Awesome decal! Came in fast and was easy to install! Also came with two Nike checks to try with before you put the actual sticker on! Huge plus!
B00YB484HW|2|These were really too small for a 1 1/4&#34; guard. They would work just fine if you had a spacer on the part that clamps on the bar but as is they broke when I tried to get them to stay in place. I dunno, maybe they sent me a smaller set?? I got a 1 1/2 inch set and they were too big, but they worked when I used rubber sheeting as a spacer. These are good looking pegs and are pretty lightweight. Lots and lots of allen head screws to loosen up, so don't forget the lock tight.
B00JW5TRYO|5|Everything fit in easily and still running strong!
B002DZJQ0A|5|Works perfectly with the EZPass Tag.
B009DJVMA6|5|Great fit, delivery time and easy to acquire. Would and have recommended to friends.
B00230P2E4|5|Got these to replace my old Grip Puppies. Installation was easy and they look and feel good. All at half the price of what I replaced. :-))
B007IQGJK4|1|very thin wires and bad connections.
B0094CMIBO|5|Yeah Baby! that's what I&#34;m talking about! Very happy with the flood lights. I can see!
B00L2JS5W8|5|Thank you
B0008FUHWI|5|Did an excellent job bringing home a car on a dolye 2200 miles.
B001050JMS|5|loved it
B00B1VBQRS|5|love royal purple products u notice a diffrence
B009ET15P2|3|Love the product and cot, but a little difficult putting it on my seats.
B00C7DDQU4|5|Just what I was looking for and wanted. After a ton of research on replacement bulbs....lumens vs. Deg. Kelvin,......55watts vs. more and all of it mixed into gether.  You see on an S type R Jaguar you need to remove the entire front bumper assemble (not a small, or pleasant, task) to replace the bulbs.  So you want to get it right the first time!!  Having been involved with the photog world (love photography) I'm quite familiar with color of light vs. deg. of Kelvin.....lower the deg. (3400 ish) more yellow the light, higher the deg.K. whiter the light that would be in the 4800~5500 deg. K....with 6500 and up getting into the blueish look that I'm not fond of.  I'm of the understanding that 4800 to 5500 deg. K is quite to very 'white' (no blue light) and is the easiest to see with. These bulbs came as 6000 deg. K.  Hmmmmmmm....anyway, installed them flipped them on....OUTSTANDING!!!! just what I was wanting....couldn't be better!!
B00C1CEHAY|5|Very easy to install. My 10 year old Son and I installed the lift in my Drive way in 2 hours. The 2 inch lift looks great. Now every time we take the kids somewhere my wife and I have a good laugh watching the kids trying to climb in and out.
B00BFJD4C6|5|Great instructions
B004470FYQ|5|Fit perfect.
B00J8W5Z9C|5|Awesome!
B00B9FEHCW|4|You will have to trim the upper holes to make it fit better.I would buy it again!
B00CLGAV6Y|1|DO NOT BUY THESE<br /><br />They worked fine for about 2 months then the bulbs burnt out my connector for the harness
B00JW1WBSM|5|Took  care  of  my problem  at a cheaper  price  than  local  parts  store.
B003B3GX2C|5|Works great paired with my Hidden Hitch.  Added a picture for those who want a reference. My car is  2011 GTI.  This is what everyone uses in Europe, no one has pickups.  The IKEA lot is full of them.
B000NJ1HIW|5|easy to adjust fitness, great looking vest
B000GTVOJQ|4|Handy tool for ensuring your front and rear sprockets are aligned.
B000JK2D06|4|Must be used on a warm surface.  If the surface is cool the wax takes a long time to dry.  Great shine for light color cars.
B002L1EQNS|4|Despite what amazon tells you it will not fit a Pontiac Sunfire without some sort of adapter kit which is not included.<br /><br />The actual seat seams fine though, I'm going to try to turn it into an office chair.
B00WCHLIPU|4|Great way to have just a key fob. Put it back together easily after placing the board in the shell. A caution to some, the key is thinner than an OEM key and it wiggles in the ignition switch. It isn't a deal breaker but may be for some.
B00MS17NXQ|4|Rubber outlines are starting to come off already.  Other than that, great all weather mats.
B00BZ3RD88|5|Great for oem mats.  Thick. Tricky to put on but not hard.  Will stay clean looking longer than carpeted.  Will prevent heel wear that is a side effect of the way I drive.  Only thing they could have done better is bit fold them when sent.  But a day in the summer heat and they were fine
B00BV6EXGY|5|Fit perfectly. No more wobble!
B00LD1F5UA|5|Quick ship and fit perfectly! Thanks
B00318NVRM|5|Works great for my 2008 Honda Fit Sport.
B001P2X4EQ|4|Looks good but has a lot of slop in reciever
B00CFH5X8K|5|perfect
B000EVYGZA|5|that´s ok, a good piece, grand seller
B00FND7MMI|5|Came in as promised. Works very well.
B001U522GO|5|My car has never looked so good.
B005I9KAWG|5|Nice
B00ITF1DNQ|5|love it
B005R7OMD2|5|ecellente
B008S9QUGI|5|Fit my 2009 GMC Sierra perfectly and does exactly what I wanted. There was no problem with it learning my key, either.
B004R900GO|5|Already paid for itself. Good unit.
B007QSAS9C|5|I've owned this rack for two years and use it several times per month to carry my mountain or road bike. Doesn't cause additional wind noise when unloaded.<br /><br />No issues to report - build quality is very good and nothing has broken. The only maintenance I perform is to spray lube the skewer a few times a year to keep it from binding when opening/closing.
B00CP6MBTA|5|Loved it
B0068ODC1Q|1|My remote lasted 4 months.  The unlock button stopped working.  The best they would offer is a 15% discount on a new unit.  Buyer beware, Warranty is 90 days.  At this pace I would spend almost 100.00 a year replacing units.  Given my OEM unit lasted almost 10 years,, I can only give 1 star.
B003BZCZZE|2|not as powerful as I expected. Doesn't really change spray that much to make a difference.
B002GTKAHQ|1|Didn't work for my bike
B00UG2QYSY|5|Just what was needed. Installs in minutes. Enough to do a car and small truck. Survived two trip to car wash so far.
B00684TAYY|5|worked perfect.. programming was easy.
B0066S2HYW|1|Purchased two for the front and rear of my driveshaft, rear one lasted 1 month and the front one is in dire need of replacement after 2 months in comparison to the stock parts which lasted 120K miles each. Not impressed.
B00KE1AV0O|4|First: these are unequivocally NOT sheepskin. They're entirely synthetic.<br /><br />That said, they're very soft and get the job done.
B000G156WA|5|Nice and easy to install.But ended up putting a larger bolt in where the sides bolt into the mid section.Didnt seem beefy enough
B00KFN06O2|2|too small
B000CFHDEY|5|Saved a bunch of money compared to auto parts store.
B0022UP8XA|5|Great cover. Fits my Vstar 1300 tourer great.
B004323RTW|4|I purchased hose to water plants and pots in small area.  It works great.
B009ONDIHG|5|Exactly what I needed to help my son park in the garage and give us all the peace of mind that he wont hit the wall.<br />Very sturdy and dependable.
B00CUX5T2Y|3|hitchgreat
B00I4RIDL4|4|angled kind of odd once installed, but overall fine
B00EC0Y7LW|5|Perfect -replacement for OEM Heated glass. It cost $20 less than OEM glass - fits and works exactly the same! 5 minutes install, clear instructions provided. The only noticeable difference is the plastic backing on the Fit System part is molded plastic, while the OEM Toyota is molded then machined plastic.
B008621V5M|5|Great experience!
B00E756NKA|5|Looks great with a tight fit.  Way better and cheaper than the neoprene seat covers that I purchased prior.
B00KWEW0CA|5|Awesome.  Works as expected and hats off to the seller for personally calling to confirm make and model knowing sometimes this part is listed on the web inaccurately.
B000AY2ODM|5|Love it!
B0070Y341G|5|Loved it .....stands out
B0087Y7T82|5|Awesome!
B001NND7C6|5|Works great. I use it on my boat as the primary ignition switch.
B000EGOJW0|5|My Husband was delighted with this Father's Day gift!
B00IGJECR4|5|Thank you
B00NB86BG0|5|Fit perfectly. Runs very quiet.
B005DQXXY6|5|Fast ship ! perfect fit !
B007TYG0KY|5|Excellent product easy install
B008CQEMN0|5|very nice helmet, perfect fit for my 7 year old
B00K73X020|3|Not all parts were included per listing, also some parts were not correctly manufactured.  I had to re-drill holes to correct size.  After a few trips to the hardware store I was able to complete the installation.  The light itself is amazing, just had to get over a few installation and part obstacles.
B00DSMEL2A|4|this stuff works OK but I believe that years ago there was a similar product I think was called hydro-seal that seemed to work better maybe the chemical make up has changed.
B00N4K6FPW|5|Work on my 95 kawasaki vulcan 800. No problem..
B001PW9ZUI|5|This item stops a rapid drop of my trucks tailgate if it slips out of my hands.
B003BZD03K|4|Product is as described, fits and is functional.  Nothing exceptional to rate the &#34;I love it&#34; 5th star
B00G6IISIG|5|Perfect color match for my Expedition interior
B00NGHM1NI|1|Poor quality and flimsy. Something I would expect from a dollar store.
B004DRY56G|4|Good deal and good quality
B00A05B298|5|Thick and sturdy, very nice quality frame.  Difficult to find one like this!
B00DBMLY8G|3|After reading about the welds failing for so many people I meant to take this to work and weld it, well I forgot. I had three pushrods left to install when the weld failed. I managed to get some vise grips clamped on the tool to finish the job. The welds actually looked decent from the outside, when they failed you could tell there was no penetration in one side.
B00D3N5Y5W|5|Fast delivery great item thank u
B005CLMDUW|5|Very easy to install. Feels like regular door handle just a little lighter in weight.
B002OIBRE4|3|PRO'S - Cheap and works well at polishing<br /><br />CON'S - NOT good at compounding except for a single use less than a whole automobile.<br /><br />Not sure when that would ever be but if you only needed a smaller job done like a golf cart, lawn mower or part of a car this will get the job done. It will also work as a polisher like to buff out paint that has been compounded or polished.
B00PJ35W1K|4|Its an alright decal, my friend thought it looked like a witch on a broom... hmmm (get new friends)
B003TQ3O6E|5|nice quality
B00ML7IELC|5|Finally!  Bright amber LEDs.<br />Bonus.  The turn signal/brake circuit, and the running light circuits are isolated from each other.<br />No need for an isolation diode to keep the turn signal circuit from also flashing the running lights.<br />3751 standard wired socket.
B0066S6W3Y|5|This item came in just a few days. It was as advertised, no surprises. Very easy assembly and auto top fit it perfectly. I would highly recommend this item.
B00HS5DRG4|5|I have had this on my car for a couple of weeks now.  It was very easy to put on without even having to measure.  It looks really good and it looks like it came on the truck instead of an accessory.  My truck is black and it really breaks up all that black in the back.  I am sure it would be good for protecting the bumper from luggage, bikes, etc but I have it for the look and hopefully it will stay in place throughout the life of the truck.
B0009VY6ZA|4|A little watery but not terrible.  Good waterless wash with no wax, just clean.  Works well on glass and rims.
B001EOV46K|1|not fit on 2&#34;
B0085IJVBI|5|Product was wonderful perfect fit easy to install
B00NA2TQFK|5|Great son loves it
B00ELHNM6C|5|good
B00DSR4JZE|4|They were cute in my convertible sadly someone hit it and they r gone
B00U3ZBTAW|5|Primarily is used to keep 6V lamp batteries charged - has done quite well.
B006ZVMZA6|5|Worked and continues to work
B007A99P7S|4|Nicely made and good armor for the price. Breaths well in 98 degree weather. Neck strap could be longer. Overall good product.
B002ZTGLCK|5|I ordered this for a 1990 Sea Doo SP that had been sitting for 14+ years. This line was very pliable and it fit on the fittings with no problems.
B002UC2Q0S|5|Very happy with quality
B00EEGJKIE|1|Cheap made, doesn't fit correctly and doesnt last long. Mine were installed for less than a month when they just fell out. When I investigated, the mounts had broken off the lights. I tried several times to contact company about the problem with no replies from the company.
B00ASKRL22|5|Very good piece. Fit well and looks great. No difference in color and easy to install. Only issue was that it was difficult to cut out the squares but once that's done its a breeze.
B008CLNYPC|5|Very good product and delivery service
B0001EXGZG|5|As described. Works well
B001JT72U2|5|I don't remember ordering these with the red jewel type tip, but they are nice quality and fit the bill.
B005MZXAMS|5|This is a big magnet you can put on your fridge or car or anywhere you want to.
B00LU0UBH6|5|Really liking this Microfiber Car Duster!! So big, picks up dirt/dust so efficiently! I have a fancy car and do not fear to use this in the interior AT ALL..... no concern or visual signs of scratches at all. Top notch, so happy. I purchased this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review.
B000SIBQBQ|5|Great product. Fast shipping
B00XZ70V5O|1|Product showed up with 1/2 the parts. Received the screws but no fasteners.  Sad because I really like the product.  Cut my hand on the plastic a few times when I had to make it work with some hardware I already had.  Sad considering what I paid for these.
B000B66UU2|1|The Handel is metal but the housing is plastic and where the bolts thread in at doesn't hold well I'm very disappointed with the handle
B005XRECOA|5|excellent any easy setup
B00NBKFID0|5|Really nice wheel looks great
B001RLU0EC|5|exactly as described. great price too.
B00LNQBQLW|2|My right led bulb when out and it wasn't even a year I need to talk to someone bout a warranty please
B00WTHE4KE|1|All plastic seals poorly but fun as I'll get out! lol
B00L4UIJQW|5|Does what its supposed to do
B000COD54W|5|Installed these in a double DIN for my sxs. They all work great, but do get a little warm after a few hours of continuous use.
B00MQ9RAZ6|5|Great decal. It was easy to apply and it sticks like no other. I applied to the read of my helmet and it suits it perfectly.
B00DK1AXBW|5|Perfect fit, happy with the quality and looks durable!
B001QUACR4|3|This bearing will not work if you have ABS system on your car.
B004BQ87YK|3|Solid product, paint seemed a lighter thin and the brush included not so great. After two coats I'm pleased with the results. The Red color was a little on the orange side but looks great on my silver wheels.
B007KTINWQ|1|Streaky and hard to wipe off
B00DMA5BPY|5|Perfect match for my Toyota Tacoma 2006. Great customer service!!
B002P8D5E8|2|This mirror physically fits my 1998 4 door Ford Explorer but does not match up with wiring harness so what I ave is an OEM looking non powered mirror. I'm not disappointed with the price for that but am very displeased that the listed info did not make clear the specifications.<br /><br />My car has the courtesy lights in the bottom of the mirrors. This mirror does NOT have the courtesy light, which I'd be fine without but I think that's why there's a different wiring connector.<br /><br />As long as you know what you're getting this is s decent deal and I'd say a great deal if the wiring is correct for your vehicle.<br /><br />Shipping and particularly packaging were great.
B00EDP3DRA|2|Unless Genssi changed their authentic packaging noted in the pictures, I received a counterfeit product. The first time I purchased there they came in the Genssi static bag, bulbs fit perfectly and worked perfectly for a little over a year. I ordered a new pair late last month and they came in an entirely different package. ( cardboard back) the bulbs didn't fit right and now the driver side light went out after only about 3 days of use. Less than 3 hours run time. Really disappointed.
B0082365AQ|3|there were no instructions in the box so it was hard for me to learn how to attach it to the kayak.
B000ELVJU0|5|Exact fit, priced right, works great.
B002L7C3IC|5|Looks awesome. Perfect fit. Delivered quickly
B006ZVKDJG|5|Worked perfectly on my son's '94 Explorer Sport. No issues.
B001GC2LVM|5|Works great for a relatively level site.  Very easy to setup.  VERY sturdy material.
B000EQC332|5|Perfect
B004J1FYFM|3|Not that durable, after a while, the suction cup failed to stay fit on my car wind shield
B004VXJFG2|5|Holds 4 reusable grocery bags perfectly.  Folds up nicely as well. Love it.
B001P6WX9O|5|very nice, just as expected
B000EDUTOU|5|great product
B004WMOKUS|5|Fits perfectly a 2014 Tenere SE
B000CM0WD6|5|Construction crew knocked off my mirror on my sammi,no note sayin opps or nothing,nice huh, this mirror is a perfect match for original,arrived fast,perfect couldn't be happier.
B000C541BM|5|Work great and fit great.
B000E7SY16|5|great product, fast shipping
B00OOY12EQ|5|Great sunglass holder....keeps my glasses securely on my visor.  Easy access to put on and take off.
B00GJX1NYE|5|Fits a 2015 GMC Sierra
B0049Z43J6|5|I used this to replace my Whipple supercharger tensioner on my 02 Silverado 5.3.  Original equipment fit and function.
B00HZSLCIY|1|It did not work out.
B00JF5HR7K|5|Nice way to add room to a vehicle.
B004NBEFXA|5|I purchased this one as a replacement for the two on my VW Winnebago Rialta.  One of the plastic ends had cracked off on one of mine, and another had grown to suffer mold on the hose.  This was the perfect replacement for both on the Rialta.  The design is very similar to the OEM installed shower, but I like the head and switch on this one a bit better.  The mounting hardware included is a real plus.  My OEM ones were bright white, but personally I like the bisque one better, as the Rialta has aged away some of its own brightness over the years.  A perfect replacement!
B007SQ3PHY|5|This a great product. Fits perfect in my Mitsubishi lancer. I am very pleased.
B00HFLH5LE|5|Worked as it described 2001 Ford Explorer Sport
B00R244E5O|1|I used this on a non polished aluminum surface and had difficulty getting it to stick at all let alone cover evenly. The end result after drying was a splotchy mess with many air bubbles possibly due to the dispensing tip. I am sure It will work for other applications but as far as my experience It was not worth the money.
B00XVS5LS4|5|This product could not be better. Easy to install, fit perfect and look great!!
B0079ZEYCE|5|It was perfect..Right part.. Shipped and received on a timely matter.
B008BVZN52|4|very nice. no surprises. seems to work fine.
B000668S9I|5|we have brought about five pots,this one was the best.i will never buy any other kind. its takes about 12 min.toheat up and that great ,my husband loves it by the way i brought 2 of them.i highly recommend them they are great.
B00IX5MM9G|5|These lights really accent my car, I love them!! I paid a little more money than the others I saw on amazon but it was definitely worth it.
B00684THQA|5|Worked like a charm.  Highly recommend :)
B00OVI9EV8|5|These are awesome for Multistradas too.  They fit 2010-2014 as well as the new 2015 DVT Multi.  I have a pair on my DVT and they plug right on and are just perfect and very high quality!
B00029WSWW|4|Very easy to install in my 2015 Tacoma. It comes with everything you need for the installation, including a IDC connector to splice into a power source without having to cut any wires. It also provided the mounting bracket in case your windshield doesn't already have it. I didn't need that for my install, as the mirror mounted to my existing bracket. Looks and works great.
B00AQJZ04G|5|Worked just as expected. Dealer programmed and cut, works perfectly!
B00AB2IHNO|3|it looks good and works well so far, however in the original door handle (that got broken after 10 years) some parts were metal. in the new one they are all plastic and it is hard to expect it would work for the next 10 years. we will see.
B004RZU3Q0|5|Liked them slot. They were just right sided, but just turned upside down for the left. For the money and the brightness, can't beat them.
B006UXKATM|3|I received this product in a quick manner. I applied the sticker to my car and within a week some of the letters were already peeling off. I ended up buying another one from a local shop that was solid and not individual letters that make up the decal.
B000L1ETUA|5|When I first got it, along with athe cargo tray a few days ago, I concluded that it didn't fit. But I went back to the reviews here and noticed one said that it REPLACES the middle/cross bar in the cargo tray--and that made it all make sense--the Highland 1042000. I now have it assembled, and like the other reviewer said--it was initially a slight struggle to fit it through the opening, but it fit all the way through perfectly.  I haven't taken it on the road yet, but it raises the tray away from the dual exhaust on our 2015 Ford Escape. I've read so many other reviews where luggage and cargo bays were BURNED UP, fires started, etc. I spent TONS of HOURS researching whether to get a roof-mounted cargo arrangement, the &#34;backpack&#34; thingie, etc. This turned out to be the best solution, with the lowest effect on gas mileage. I got the Masterlock swivel head receiver. I can lock the entire assembly to the truck with this, and remove the assembly and put it in the Escape with the larger seat folded down. This is perfect!
B000WJA5F4|5|This RAM Mount is the only one that will work on my 2008 Harley V-Rod (no room on the bars).  Ram Mounts (in general) are awesome products - I have been using them for years.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Love the sunshade. It keeps my steering wheel much cooler as well as the rest of the car. And, living in Texas, we're right in the middle of 100+ temperatures.
B005UQQADU|4|Fits well in my 2012 Honda CR-V. The front ones seem like good quality.
B00RNCNG5E|5|Great color, light weight, shipped and arrived in 2 days!
B000C5G88Q|5|Great product!
B00BOEN4XG|2|This is little short for 2013 Santa Fe.
B0065V2QNC|5|Great replacement
B001NITXV0|4|Solid product, installation went OK, except the &#34;handle nuts&#34; are poorly attached.  Both nuts became separated from handle while just hand-tightening the matching bolts.  Made torquing the bolts very hard as the nut is in a tight location and had to be held with a wrench.
B000C8NW2I|5|Exactly as described and fit perfectly into my VW B5 Passat. There was no need to remove any screws, as the included instructions said. You only need to peel back the weather stripping on the passenger side and then simply lift the cover to gain access.
B010C8FAWW|5|Hilarious. Great quality. And affordable!
B00TQ07IOQ|5|LOVE these floor mats! I hate rubbery floor mats that look like they belong in Semi Trucks. These mats provide the comfort and protection I need without the look of an ugly floor. The cloth is luxurious, and with a little spray of scotch guard for protection, I feel like I am in heaven with the Oxgord heavy duty floor mats.<br /><br />The universal fit was perfect for my minivan, and didn't get in the way, or leave a corner sticking up into nowhere. The black color is very rich and contrasts perfectly with my black and grey car seat covers. I would definitely purchase these again.<br /><br />Received at a discount for the honest review provided.
B00B4S29JC|4|Very thin rubber for a floor mat
B0049IZSS8|3|will not work for towing a trailer.
B000CITK8S|4|Works good let's see if we can last as long as my  14 year old Harley Davidson battery tender did
B00NC8LQAK|4|great looking!!
B00K59SUM6|5|Makes my bumper.
B010C8FAWW|5|Exactly what I expected and its on my Snap On tool box now. Good quality and size is good too.
B00GI4P6DS|5|Probably the most handy tool set in my tool box.
B00DQJ8T00|3|Looks cool on my Wrangler Unlimited, but I can't pull in any stations now.
B002FYDGK0|5|Excellent
B00PKJ7PRC|1|Quality is poor at best! Bought it as a gift for our daughter...RETURNED IT!!! Was to embarrassed to give this as a gift !! Very thin, bad screen print job, small in size, and had no teeth on the underside to keep mat in place.
B000C53TWE|5|This is the original part and it work excellent
B0035ZI9VE|2|product did not work as stated
B00O83OBQY|4|Good product. Clear leds are a little dim.
B006DB0UVY|4|Works great thanks
B008SEBQ2G|2|If you like the look, then buy it.  If you plan to use this for FM reception, you should not buy it.  I get no FM reception, but I have been a satellite subscriber for the past 12 years, so I kept it.
B004BE7VF8|5|Fantastic tow plugs and I'm the envy of my pals.  ONLY drawback is it's really hard to get the wires routed properly in the back so the plastic cover closes tightly.  Should have been a little more thought put into the design of that portion.  Still the best 7 way I've seen and I put them on all my trailers.
B00GDH3HE0|5|Great decal!
B009J0YB02|5|This fit my 2004 Hyundai Elantra (Avante) perfectly. I'd intended to buy a fuel filter, but purchased this tank breather filter instead. It was a bit of a pain to install (because I refused to remove the entire fuel filler line), but it works nicely.<br /><br />As well, I was throwing a trouble code (P0455, evaporation leak detected). I'd mistakenly filled my tank beyond the automatic cutoff point for the fuel pump to trow this code. After replacing the fuel breather filter, the code ceased to appear. Plus, I had a lot of salt caked into the older filter...<br /><br />Attached are photos of where the filter is located on the Elantra, and what my old filter looks like compared to the new one.
B004YKGX8A|4|nice product
B00FJT0304|5|A+
B00D29P5CO|4|Great for the price. Fit well and so far no pulls or tears.
B0031HNHQI|2|It does not fit the Jeep Patriot 2008, it is larger than the compartiment, I have managed to get it in, but the air flow decreased substantially.
B000BUU5UO|5|Works well, as advertised.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Great product and even better customer service.  This company values its customers and products and I will definitely consider purchasing from this company again. As for the sun shade itself, i looked high and low for a good quality yet affordable shade.  I first purchased a shade from a big name store, needless to say it was horrible, it didnt keep my car cooler and in fact it kept falling off.  Then I came to trust Amazon, i soon found the Car Windshield Sunshade Jumbo by X-Shade, the reviews and rating were great and i knew i had to get it.  I immediately purchased it and it came 1 day sooner than expected.  I have the new 2016 Honda HR-V and the windshield is on the bigger/wider side so I needed something jumbo.  This shade is a tad too wide for my car but i am not complaining.  i would rather it be too bag than too small.  my car is kept cooler and i need that during the hot Southern California summers.  I 100% recommend this product and company.
B00HTOB0NG|5|these anti flicker work great
B00DCULNXS|3|The wire clips could be better at creating contact.
B00CKXIAHK|4|Bolted right up...no hassle...no fuss!  Highly reccomend!
B002V0P91C|5|look good and functional
B00CNX0NGI|5|Quick delivery, and it fits my Intelligent Key perfectly. It should keep my key looking like new, plus it looks good on.
B0088JR9X6|5|Does what it is meant to do!  Came a day sooner than expected!
B006D9W1OU|1|The picture shows a mount that goes behind the tail light and mounts on the Passenger side. What came was a mount that goes behind the spare tire, and doesn't have the proper clearance to mount behind the spare. It will mount, however, there's no way to attach an antenna without buying a tire stand off from them. I'd call it a bait-n-switch if someone asked me.
B0082ACB8E|3|we put the cover on easily. the thing is the front does not fit flat. had to take it off and bend it some so it would be flat.<br />Now it fits fine.
B002DOME1E|5|As described....
B00BSXHMA4|5|Great product. Fast shipping. No more check engine light.
B0002KKIXC|2|I used this product for pet stain removal and it did not completely remove any of the stains. The stains only got lighter. This is also after 2-3 applications of the product over a span of 3 days. I let warm water sit on the stain as a pre-treament. I also let the product sitfor about 15 minutes before trying to remove the stain. No good for me
B002E58RCW|5|Great
B00CHD1IBI|5|It arrived exactly as said to and is what I was looking for.
B002UC2UB8|5|Good quality slow shipping.
B0009OR974|4|You got lock rings, you need these pliers.
B0006IX87S|5|This so far works well for what it is. I am using it in conjunction with my water pressure regulator. This obviously goes in line after the pressure regulator.<br />The small flex line between the filter and the hard fixed connection into the camper is a great idea. I have seen the broken before.
B001C6Q34S|5|Replaced on my Subaru Forester 2014 - fits well and it's affordable.
B00681BE2S|5|Great product
B001W100OW|5|Great
B00ITCBBSQ|5|I bought it for one car and now I have it for all of them.... People always ask permission to take pictures !<br />Love the message
B00JT4XWNU|5|Great material
B00F2OCRZU|4|Very nice
B000CMIGB6|1|Wrong belt for the Dodge Ram 2005 1500 5.7 V8. Although Amazon fitment said it was good, it was too narrow and thinner, 6 ribs instead of 7. Sending it back. The Gates K071013 is perfect Arrived on time. Just wrong spec, Amazon's fault.
B0016C1Q22|4|I've used this combo kit before it's a very good product, however the re-useable storage container is  a joke.  The container is worthless as an on going storage item.  The previous version was an actual box and was very good, too bad Reese got cheap with this item.
B000CMKF1K|5|Very  satisfied
B00DSD54OI|5|Extremely happy with the staff great people and very understanding
B00S4Y5WA2|5|Worked as expected. It would be nice if they came in different colors but i painted mine to match the motorhome.
B0018YGAWO|5|Great quality, very happy. Seems well made.
B00OU5LOT2|5|great tape the remote is perfect and installation is easy
B00NOL6RSG|5|I have compared other brands too and I bought it only because it came at a really low price. Since then I never had any issues with it and it glows tremendously bright. I think the other brands would do the same thing but only at a higher cost so I would tell everyone to go for it.
B005C5AL70|5|Excellent product as described.  This fits my 2004 Yamaha Vstar perfectly.
B005FLYZ2I|4|Cant beat the price
B005GHB5U6|2|wish i bought the half face onne
B00IN5BS4G|5|Work just fine. Installed by professional mechanic with ease.
B00881EQ1C|5|I've been using it in my car for a couple of months and so far it works well, I like that it matches the color of my car.
B000COD56A|4|Installed these in a double DIN for my sxs. They all work great, but do get a little warm after a few hours of continuous use. I bought the red, green, amber and blue. Only the blue is a little faded on the color.
B00JQ5RBXE|5|look even better than new, tricky to install on the wheels but solid hold once on..
B002UC30AS|5|Easy to apply to RV.
B00CFOKXM4|5|Excellent
B00397K12S|5|Perfect for my Black Widow mix! Thx!
B0002F66H4|5|Does the job nicely
B000GKD5NI|5|Works great! Fits perfect! I recommend!
B00EXPARVU|5|Went on great. Looks awesome on the back of my truck, even when they're playing awful (Hint: Most of the time). Make sure the temp is above 50 or else it won't adhear well to the window.
B00V523CGQ|5|worked like a charm on my 200 Avalanche. Got the key cut at Home Depot for no charge. took minutes to program the key and the fob using the emailed instructions. excellent product and price
B002A2L5K0|5|My son loves it.  He is a Ford Mustang lover.
B00CDGNX26|5|fit my 2005 ram 3500 works great
B00EA0ZB7I|4|Put these on my boat arch, lit up the back of the boat far better then I expected actually too brute but that's not their fault. I don't know how they will hold up in weather and salt water/air but so far so good. Mounting bracket isn't what was shown in photo it doesn't have two bolts mounting it to the bracket only one.
B00UVJ0GC2|5|These both work excellent! They arrived on time and were easy to install. My install was a little more time consuming because I modified them to work with my bar mirrors. But other than that, super easy. They feel like good quality grips, the levers are a little cheaper feeling but still decent quality. They were exactly what my bike needed!
B00HRMT1LI|5|Very nice for the price. All the bulbs were correct size. I even got an ninth (extra) bulb in the pack. They  are plenty bright, no less than they original halogens and they look great turned on. Everything fit in nice with zero modification.
B000C2YB0G|5|Best price around, top of the line Gates product.  Takes care of the annoying belt squeak on Ford 7.3.  If you notice rubber building up on your smooth idler pullies on your 7.3, you're going to need this soon.  Your old tensioner isn't holding enough tension on the belt, causing it to slip (and melt) on the idler pulley.
B00BK85EDY|5|Good
B00CB8WM2S|5|Item looks just as advertised, very sturdy. I hope I never have to test it!
B004JBJYFS|5|exact part
B008XNZZ7O|5|Helped get years of sports out of my car!
B0006307GI|1|Will never buy MSD again, stick with AC Delco. Lasted 2 months and I can't return it now!
B004ETK0AI|4|perfectly as described.
B0068ETFKS|5|I put this on my 2013 Kawasaki Vulcan VN900 Custom when I added the Cobra Fi2000 PowrPro Tuner and Cobra Speedster Swept Black Exhaust.  I installed all three easily in a couple hours.  They work extremely well together and have given the bike extra, sustained performance.  NO - I do not work for Cobra.
B00NTO8SZ8|4|Looks great but plastic insert loose and slipping already. Making my own sleeve out of aluminum for support. Still a great shifter
B009FU7RZM|5|Easy install. Work great
B000C2Q5PK|5|Cheaper then autozone and so far two months in works just fine.
B007SY3MRO|5|Excellent
B0002Z9MJ8|4|Looks great but came with dents but easy to knock them out
B009AA9IN6|4|OK
B00RB66KU0|1|A lot smaller than I thought,description said nothing about these being miniature.
B00BLPPOAO|5|Thanks
B00ITNLDCY|5|Used this in conjunction with the Bug-Off spray and worked like a charm.
B008ITZ6F4|3|Too small for Texas plates...
B00HSRNVRW|5|Excellent product. Fits perfectly. Keeps that scorching sun out of the car.
B00INVF6P2|5|Great wire.  Used to create a control panel for my electric brew kettle.  Used for all the 240V 22A connections.
B0050I14OI|3|For me it work fine
B00BQE5HUW|5|very good
B00KAMIOH4|5|awesome headlights for the price
B00BQE5IKG|5|very good
B00480J4JG|2|It only lasted thirty days. But it did fit perfect and the light it produced matched my other side perfectly, even though it is two years newer.
B000OV32MI|5|This is so huge you need it!
B00G186POK|5|It´s nice.
B00GUDCVN0|4|made my gate open on auto like it should
B0092JVZA4|4|Keeps my engine running at a cool pace.
B006ZJ1ZXG|5|Great pricing
B000AOLUM8|3|Conceptually an excellent tool; however the grip surface on many steering wheels is radiused slightly....requiring that the &#34;hook&#34; be slightly longer.  Had to use a C-clamp to draw the two legs together in the puller to make it work.  Construction and temper are excellent....what you'd expect from OTC.
B006WGAGUK|5|Great little license plate light. Works perfectly on my trailer.
B00JWZJSQ6|5|Love it! You won't regret  it. Perfect  size ( truck ) looks so good<br />Is perfect
B00RYT9CFE|5|Awesome!! So far so good. They are all bright and every single one has worked.
B008FOCVAA|2|It was suppose to remove ink stain from my leather purse. It didn't. I read that the stain has to be fresh. The information given about the product doesn't say the stain has to be fresh. Maybe that is why it didn't remove the ink stain. So that is why I gave it 2 stars.
B0067F0XY0|5|I love the idea of taking my pet on a ride instead of leaving her in a kennel until I come home. My dog loves the bag and I do to. It is safe for the pet and securely mounts in your back seat back rest. Great product for pet owners with motorcycles.
B003TTYUHS|1|It leaked because of a flaw or defect in the cap threading, gas can that leaks when you pour gas one star & returned
B00029XC2M|1|Sucks!
B008S9CHW4|3|Good helmet.  A little tight for the large I am used too.
B001RWD97Q|5|Product was packaged securely and arrived as promised. I have not yet installed it on my truck but it is built well.
B00PVEUHU8|5|The set came in with everything i could need. I needed a T30 torx bit and decided I might as well get this as a bundle. The T30 worked flawlessly (they're notorious for stripping on inferior grade bits) and I threw this set in my trunk right next to my spare. I've used this a dozen times already and has come in useful every single time.
B00PYBHONG|2|Already been through one disc in two months after only three uses at 3800rpm.  Plus they soak up all the wax, turning it into a wax blob.  Used just as I did the old larger pads.  The old larger pads were made much better, using them every month or two for over a year.
B0056IUHAE|4|These really make my bike stand out. As some others have noted the metal is a little soft. Mine have bent inward just a little. It's not a big deal to me because it doesn't affect the ride or take away from the overall appearance either. I honestly probably would not even noticed it up to this point if I didn't see some of the other post.
B00WFOPCUM|4|Video quality is well more than sufficient for seeing obstructions in day or night. IR illumination works great at night too. I've given it several hose downs and the waterproofness seems to be ok. It looks good too and wasn't hard to mount. I gave it four stars because it's video wasn't supreme HD but I feel I'm being a little critical here.
B00PZ6KLO4|5|Great product
B00GFWM98S|5|Great instructions attached. Made the install easy enough for me and now I don't have to worry about anything falling apart on me in that area of my car. Thanks guys for the good quality and easy to follow instructions. Perfect!
B00EL0NJX0|1|These are quite cheaply made<br />The adhesive that attaches the mirror to the frame failed and I came out to find a chipped mirror sitting on the pavement by my bike.<br />The main tightening bolt is also cheap metal and I stripped one of them during install
B0006HJP2Q|5|2000 XJ great upgrade<br />great product, also replaced coils springs, shocks, tires, and upgraded to H4 headlights with relays<br />see full review and photos under Moog CC782 coil springs
B00RLRK7TE|1|Terrible,,, they slide all over and get lost under the seat
B0001EFSTI|4|This tool is awesome. Has not fallen off yet, have used it about 10+ times already! The smallest flat head does not work on glasses, but it does a good job.
B0006PJE8S|5|Great replaced the worn out previous one.
B000WKLJNK|5|I have used this always in my KTM 990, and now in most of my street bikes. It simply outlasts and outshifts anything else I've ever used (I have 9 motorcycle dirt and street so have some experience with oils). And it outlasts other oils (still shifting well) at least 2x. I've done a track day on my Tiger, still shifts great. I ride my 990 hard, shifts as good when I change it as when I put it in. The 990 is hard to change with my case guards, so I'm very glad this lasts a long time.<br /><br />I will say this is the US made version. In the past, I've used their Made in Switzerland version. Supposed to be the same. I think this shifts very very slightly more notchy than the former, but that is in my Triumph Tiger 1050 which isn't great shifting to begin with so I'm not going to convict on that one try. I will try in my other bikes at next change.<br /><br />This was significantly cheaper than buying from the KTM dealer.<br /><br />If another Amazon vendor had the Made in Switzerland version, I'd probably go for that but more from a feel good standpoint than anything.
B00996MO00|5|I was quite impressed with the quality! The &#34;sticker&#34; price was a little steep but worth every dime. It was delivered promptly and i would for sure do buisness with seller again. Thanks!
B00ENKGWRS|4|Those things really work,if u really want to u can get over 3inches of lift in the front.i installed them on a 04 chevy tahoe z71 and they worked great
B002R4SY3W|5|Thank you
B007N69IRA|5|Worked great!!
B008B39EMI|5|Great cleaner for the drive train. Gets the oil and grime off every time! Very pleased w this product!
B00429Y8ZI|1|It's not the quality I expected at all, seems as the plastic will break at any moment.
B00BMU9B0W|1|Installed three days ago already lost two .
B000EQCVCK|5|Very straight forward install. Use the first jack to raise the car and extend the existing shock tube. Jack up the suspension to raise the wheel for removal. Once you cut the restraint band on the shock-it'll extend. You'll need all the room you can get between the top and bottom brackets to get the new shock installed. Other than that 30 minute job for both sides on the front.
B00MG0RBL8|5|Exactly what I ordered and fixed the bent handlebars on my Foreman Rubicon. Perfect... for now. Lol
B000ALBZ0I|1|No works for me
B0047DGVTK|5|item just as described, easy to install. be careful with top bolts, easy to &#34;wring off/ break stud&#34;. Ask me how I know, follow tourqe instructions. car drives & rides like new
B00JYJSV5Y|3|Works well and sounds a lil better. But no real notice in Fuel or anything else
B00GVEGC5Q|1|Does not fit unless you modify parts of your truck. Which can be pricey if you do not have the torch equipment to do it yourself.
B0043DYCAY|5|simple to use, reusable, fast shipping!!!
B002XM383O|5|GOOD VALUE.
B000BRQ0TW|1|To thick for a repair to a PVC pipe in my pool.  Did not bond well.
B003QUGPW8|4|Excellent for around the house and on the car. They should last a good while if you know how to properly care for microfiber towels
B000V7W4E2|5|The license plate definitely met my expectations. Thanks!
B010Q24TZ8|2|I was excited when the covers arrived, but after trying on the handles and inspecting them I was not sure if I should install them or not.<br />Few things I noticed that made me uncertain....<br />1) The finish is not good enough. I can see and feel some rough/sharp edges on all pieces.<br />2) It does not cover completely the handles. I can see and feel the 1mm difference between the cover and the handle body.<br />3) Some with scratches although they were all packed in a plastic bag individually.<br />Looking for some other alternatives or products.
B005NIZRIE|5|Easy to install and works fine
B0009V1WXE|4|The bungee cords do the job, and the organizer is nice to keep them from going everywhere in my trunk, BUT- the plastic/rubber smell is AWFUL, it sticks on your hands and makes my whole car smell bad. I guess you get what you pay for.
B0023VFHYS|5|It fits well
B003UM9GDM|5|Easy to put together. Bike felt pretty solid on jack.  No issues at all.  And free shipping to hawaii.  Can't beat that.  Thank you
B00M1Y37VM|5|Great oil at a great price. Will have to look for another source after Amazon raised the price though.
B000CMH4BY|5|Perfect fit, package arrived faster than expected.
B00029J3C0|5|Good quality product. Worked great for 1976 Corvette. Was able to get rid of the huge OEM mufflers.
B00S6KGMM6|1|Unlike what is said in the detail specifications of this product on the Amazon website, the icarsoft i960 does not address supplemental restraint system codes on the Porsche 911 (997 model).  icarsoft technical support confirmed this when I contacted them.  Not sure what else it says it does, but really doesn't.  If you need an OBD reader for your Porsche, buy another brand.
B008IYH3Z0|5|Great! It still with no problems. Thank you very much
B002VVO1CY|2|I did not get to mount the windshield onto my bike until at least 30 days had passed as my bike was at the factory getting a trike kit made for it. When I got it back, I found out that the handlebar clamps were only 1 inch. My handlebar is larger. I looked through the information received and found where it stated that the windshield cams standard with the 1&#34; clamps. Had I known that, I would not have ordered it, for my opinion is that if it says it will fit, then it should fit. Figuring it was to late to really do anything about it. I mounted it with some clamps I fashioned until I can find something I like. Also due to the angle of the rake, coupled with having to mount it so low on the forks, it does not redirect much wind off of me. I would have to say that I am disappointed in this purchase.
B00IO945P0|5|we received the wrong rear break pads but every thing else was very good. thay did replace the pads very quickly. will order again.
B000F6F99G|5|Solved my parking problem.  I have only 3 inches in front and 3 in back.  I have a 750LI and can't afford a scratch.  Worked perfect.
B00BWOW8JE|5|Was easy to install on a lift, I could see it being a pain without one. Have already towed with it and it worked great. Fit was very good, had to pry a little bit but nothing to fuss about. Seems like it will last a long time rust free here in NC.  I use it with a Curt 2&#34; Euroball mount.  Also my car is lowered and it has not scraped or hit anything.  Does not hit the muffler.  If you want to haul with your Golf/GTI, and have people look surprised, this is it. Ive seen the curt model and you can see way too much of the support bar, this blends in nicely and is rated the same.
B009ZC9OME|5|Perfect Gita!
B005GM9K08|5|First time buyer of NRG its a solid quick release plus you hear and feel it when locks so no worry about steering wheel being pulled off
B001IH8PN8|5|works as discribed
B0009TTOM2|5|This is exactly what I needed. The pictures of the product were very helpful. Fits well and looks to be a well made part.
B00BC372EG|4|Great low profile German Style helmet.<br /><br />Pros: Look, Fit, comfort, chin strap, comes with a soft carrying bag.<br /><br />Cons: Reason for only 4 stars: Though it says DOT it doesn't meet the rule. There is no manufacturer name on the tag in the helmet which is a requirement to be DOT.<br />Padding is very thin and doesn't appear this would provide much protection in the event you go down.<br />Make sure you get the right size because if not at higher speeds the helmet will lift from force of air above 70mph.
B000C2AISU|5|Fit my 2003 Subaru Legacy.  No issues at all.
B000X90YUO|5|Works great!.  I added a 25' polyurethane hose and this pump now suits me well.
B00MQ5Z5F2|5|This was a pleasant surprise....A friend told me about this and now that I have it I use it a LOT!!!....The battery lasts a long time!!......1 year later....XP-10 is still working fine....The best money ever!.....obviously I will buy the next gen!
B00XB6HLG6|4|Provides good shade, a little foggy
B00GI9IFUO|5|All good.
B00KL3ALGO|5|Easy to put up and easy to take down. Stored in the glove compartment during a 3 week long road trip.
B005RSUOBU|5|Love it
B00PWKPE6I|2|It's nice as keychain but even with the little magnifier the print was still too.tiny to even guess at a word. I o Lyceum galilee e it two stars because it was not readable.
B00062YZSA|5|excellent replacement
B004GE4H6E|5|WAS GREAT EXPERIANCE
B0040CYWX0|5|perfect
B003N8QXDE|1|Will not line up correctly with stock 168 tooth flywheel gm 350, keeps jamming on flywheel tried every possible adjustment then tried to file gear down so it wouldn't catch, past return stage so threw it away, have had good luck with this brand in the past but this think is junk for 72 GM 350 block.
B000IXRMSM|5|perfect
B003CH3Z8W|5|Using this with a PORTER-CABLE 7424XP and Meguiar's SoftBuff 6.5&#34; polishing and finishing pads. Results when detailing my boat have been good.
B00MQ5Z5F2|5|This is an unbelievable product! Upon receipt, plugged it in to charge and sure enough...within a week, my wife's car battery died. Grabbed my little Micro-Start and gave it a try. Hooked it up, tried to fire up the engine and it started right up! AMAZING! I would HIGHLY recommend this product.
B00NDB3F1Y|3|Not worth the price
B0060HZB10|5|VERY GOOD
B0073XTN14|5|Good antenna for my 2006 Toyota Corolla. I had one for my 2010 Rav4 and decided to buy one for my Corolla. I really like it.
B000O0HOT6|5|Perfect fit !
B007SZL8LK|1|This item did not fit the 2-inch hitch on my 2003 Toyota 4Runner
B005N6ZRM2|5|Old classic shirt. Had this one when i was a teenager and loved it then and love it now. Now I'm 44. Still a biker
B00B2AAP5M|2|picture is miss-leading, very narrow.
B00JH3EU6G|5|It came in a 6&#34; by 6&#34; by 48&#34; box - rolled up and after I laid it out for several days with 'weight' items in each corner...it molded well.  It fits the FIT as I expected.  It will protect my trunk area from wear and tear and any if I have any wet items. They were delivered timely.
B00E4ZBX12|4|nice product, especially for the price!
B0002JMF98|5|works great
B008VGRMJC|4|working out just fine..........good product
B00075XCSA|1|Amazon vehicle checker failed me too. Did not fit 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee and cant return now.
B00W5MG8XY|5|Just kidding, obviously. Who wants all that hot water in a moving vehicle? But a very sturdy little multi-purpose device for your center console or glove box. Everything works as needed, including the glass-break tool and seatbelt cutter. I know this because Spouse insisted on taking it to one of his Vehicle Extrication training days. Perfect size for control and comfort. With this and a fire extinguisher in your vehicle, you're prepared.
B000OAXTN6|5|I bought this several months ago and just recently had some time to install it.  The main reason I bought it is because my old exhaust (that a previous owner installed) was falling apart.<br /><br />This kit was installed on a 2003 GMC 2500HD crew cab with short box.  It comes with an extension pipe for long box, but it you don't have a crew cab you may need to cut one of the pipes per the instructions.<br /><br />I comes with u-bolt clamps so you can install yourself and it doesn't require welding.  The hangers worked for me, but I didn't need one of them (probably for the long box).<br /><br />They are louder than stock (obviously), but they aren't too loud until you get above 2000 RPM.  Even then they aren't horrible.<br /><br />If I had it to do over again I would probably go with the 4&#34;.  The 5&#34; actually goes under a cross member and you don't have quite as much ground clearance.  It isn't bad, but it does hang below the frame a few inches.<br /><br />One other thing.  The instructions say you will need to remove the spare tire and you may not be able to reinstall it.  I have a full size spare (16&#34;x8&#34; rim) and I didn't have to remove the spare for installation (or leave it out).
B00K9Z3R2O|4|This liner is too long and has to be trimmed to fit the back of a 2015 GMC Terrain,  other than that it seems to be well make...
B000E347LQ|5|It was about a 90 minute job, most of the time was spent taking the old one out. Everything seems to work AOK. The included instructions are good enough, but if you want to see it done: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_m8MM55BKk
B009IK9RXO|5|Great product, great service, A+++!
B009MAI7HW|3|Not really meant for Oregon plates as tags get covered
B00MM0J8S6|5|LOVE them!!
B00EAJQI3A|5|Nice filters with o-rings included.
B00G1Y4PWS|5|Love em work great
B000CSGT64|5|works great.
B00KN0UOEE|5|As most everyone knows, there is no product as good as this for protecting various things from the sun!  Great price and I don't have to drive across town to get it!
B000182EV4|5|Stays in place, Was a little worried that the adhesive wouldn't because of the hot humid summers here in Georgia, U.S.A..<br />Through the summer heat, car washes and mostly highway driving , they've stayed in place.<br />Great buy and way better price than the local parts store.
B00BERR5Z6|5|Works Great! Just make sure your motor doesn't need replaced or else the back won't attach properly. Shipped Quick and had Great packaging to protect mirror!
B004VZ0V7M|5|Well made and looks good.
B001C5CPR8|5|Fast delivery and as described
B009F5A4LQ|4|This is a good quality hitch.  I got it mostly to carry bicycles off the back of my CRV.  Installation is pretty easy, I encourage you to<br />internet search on CRV hitch installations for lots of good videos and tips.  My installation experience was a bit different than a lot of the<br />reviews and tips out there.  First, taking the muffler off the rubber mounts was dead easy.  I sprayed a good amount of WD40 on the rubber, waited<br />a minute, put on a pair of garden gloves and they came off with very little effort.  I'm not like a Superman or anything, so I think an average<br />folk with proper lubrication would not struggle with the rubber mounts.<br /><br />Next, I mapped out the place to cut the access in the plastic panel on the drivers side.  The hitch comes with instructions that work, so follow<br />them and you'll be fine regarding location.  That said, there is no need to remove the panel to cut the access.  Mark it off with a sharpie, put a new<br />blade in your razor knife, and cut away.  In my case, I left a flap on the outboard side of the car.  So, cut towards the middle of the car top and bottom, and close that cut again towards the middle.  fold the plastic back and you'll see your mounting holes.  There is a white insulation under the black plastic, again I was able to poke holes in that with the sharp knife, and it folded back as well.<br /><br />Mount the hitch, pretty easy.  I put a bolt into the passenger side, raised the hitch onto the drivers side, put both bolts in there, circled back and threaded in the other passenger side bolt, then installed the U bolt on the tow loop.  Once all the fasteners where in place, crank them down with a torque wretch (if you don't have a torque wrench, well really tight is what you want).<br /><br />I folded the plastic flap back in place, drilled a few little holes and used a couple of ty-raps to close it off.  I did use some good tape to seal off the plastic cuts, but that really isn't required.<br /><br />My CRV had a full Minnesota Winter, and I didn't find the mounting holes to need more than a squirt of WD 40 to allow the mounting bolts to thread right in.  I doubt you'd need a M11 tap if your car is a year or two old.<br /><br />The hitch is not real heavy, I had no issue holding it up to start a bolt on the muffler side, and then pushing it up thru the plastic panel to mount the other bolts.  Easy one person job.<br /><br />So, nit pick I am, but I knocked a star off because there are like four ugly stickers that you can see on the hitch once it is mounted.  They don't peel off cleanly, so if I decided to get rid of them, I'll spend as much time getting them off as it took to mount the hitch.<br /><br />In any case, this is an easy install, plenty of room under the CRV to work, and it fits fine.  I recommend this hitch and suggest it easy for any average handyman to bolt on.ng holes to need more than a squirt of WD 40 to allow the mounting bolts to thread right in.

B000JFHNEC|5|These are super rock solid, I would recommend.  I was leary to purchase but was very satisfied when I used them.
B00GXLFCRG|5|Looks great went down easy and did not have all the dust that previous reviews had but would be nice if they included a part for the top of the boat rail above the cup holder
B0082GKQQW|5|These are great &#34;cheap&#34; rubber floor mats. They fit nicely in my 2011 Toyota Rav4. I trimmed the driver side one near the gas pedal area along the provided seam just to keep that area clear. I would recommend these for all-season floor mats if you don't want to drop the $$$ for carpeted mats. If they get dirty just hose them off, dry, and you're good to go!

B002VFWTDS|5|Not much to say, they fit the vac and work as they shoud.
B00PV7K0FC|5|bought this for my husband. nice, heavy asstray, perfect for holding any size cigar.
B004DRSQD4|4|Aside from an alignment issue in the LH headlight that needed to be repaired, all else was okay.
B00G8UNQQ6|5|A+
B000EALHHG|5|I used to demo this in Costco years ago.  It is by far the bet spray cleaner there is.  No one carried it anymore.  I even called the company and told them they should put this is the laundry and women's section instead of car cleaning.  It gets the color off my hands when stained with food coloring in cake decorating.  This arrived so fast that I thought it went by drone!!!!
B007KPTRVG|2|very nice looking windshield, but will not and i mean ,will not protect you from the wind if your over 6 ft tall.
B003NBFKDK|3|Very poorly made.  I will never think this could carry 500 lbs as advertised.  It does hold 2 bicycles.
B000AMXSUM|5|Big improvement over stock headlights, noticed the difference immediately. Very pleased.
B009YRI64C|5|great
B003SOKEXI|5|Fit perfectly. I was replacing the old one on my 2003 F150 that the switch levers had gotten broken off. This one fit into the door panel exactly. Snug fir, plug was exact fit as well. Prior to changing the mirrors would only work side to side. This not only fixed the look, but the entire function is restored.
B00ICUW95E|4|great for visibility if you really need to be seen. i put it on my motorcycle helmet and on the back of a motorcycle backpack.
B000FW4LT4|5|No scratches and took off all the ice i used it on.
B00P2D3W0A|5|These perform just like halogen bulbs from a brightness standpoint. And that is a very good thing because LED bulbs can be dim or too bright when buying online so these being stock brightness is great. These give you the instant on and off that looks great from LED bulbs. Don't expect the light to look much different with the exception of the instant on and off.
B0091RA02G|5|Great little unit. Performs as expected, allowing a broad variety of positions.
B00VDPBCWG|5|I got it for my husband n he loves it!
B001O0U0C8|5|They are exactly as described, very pleased with this purchase.  I can't afford to go to a shop, so these were perfect for my budget.
B00IXZU2WU|5|Doing a complete timing repair and this tool really makes the job so easy
B000CB6D0S|5|Perfect fit. It does a great job with outdoor smells. I barely smell anything anymore in my cabin.
B001TMEIZQ|4|Cup holder came quickly as advertised . Cup holder was factory which is cheaply made but does meet my need. Very easy to install after watching a you-tube video. Would recommend this product and seller
B00RCA2C3Y|4|They are economical and work as advertised. The package arrived in a timely fashion and i installed them on a 2000 F350 with no problems in 20 mins. They have a cheap bulb type connector that fit my factory socket,  worked temporarily but i plan on hard wiring. Not a bad buy
B00J3364D2|5|Fit perfectly the color was exact.  Thanks
B002ZTGX3W|5|Everything worked out well. My order was on-time which was amazing! The part fit great! I need another part for my car, so I'll definitely order again!
B008D5TTBU|5|Can't beat the price for this package, I currently have the low beams installed on my 2006 Honda Civic Si and oh my they look amazing at night, although they aren't that much brighter than the factory bulbs, that bright white color makes it seem brighter to me, I rarely drive at night time as it is, so if these aren't meant to last that long they probably will for me, I'll most likely buy another set just to have extra bulbs on hand. Try them out, at 10 bucks you can't beat giving them a shot!
B002UXT3NU|5|Very useful.  Clips to keyring as advertised.
B00279NGRG|5|Part was a great price & works great
B0024E5T7Y|5|arrived early, way to go!! fit the step perfectly looks nice, very easy to put on
B00GBVHPNW|3|The quality seems pretty good, but when these things say &#34;large&#34; - don't assume it's kind of a &#34;one-size fits all L/XL.&#34;  I don't consider myself to have large hands, in fact, my friends constantly will joke about my &#34;sausage fingers.&#34;  These barely fit.  I would advise *most* people buy the XL size, as they may be more comfortable even for those with smaller hands, like myself.  Additionally, something with the stitching makes them a bit itchy right around the wrist.<br /><br />Not bad for the discounted price I paid of less than $9, but I wouldn't really suggest them to anybody but beginner riders who just need a pair to take a test or something.
B00U50RNBO|5|very satisfied
B003IHMHLW|5|A little awkward to install by one's self, but works smoothly and love the grease fitting.  Replaced my old one with this and it rolls much easier.  For some reason in the past 30 years the boat has gotten heavier????
B00CPGQ1GO|4|Does what it suppose to do.
B008ACHYFE|5|Very bright. Great fit and super easy to install.
B004GEDV3E|5|I don't find the Lexus sign
B000CN565O|3|could not find a drill bit the right size to fit them to my heads
B00WO0AYM8|5|They look really nice..well liked...Yes I recommend this item...
B003RY53U8|5|With these mugs, my coffee is to hot to drink for 10 minutes, and is still wonderful  tempurature an hour later.
B00AQZAMZM|5|oem perfect
B00BI2APMW|5|This code reader is really easy to use and for most folks is the only reader they'll need.  The more expensive readers have expansive data bases that match the error code with the make, model and year of your vehicle and provide solutions for a fix.  This product won't do that, but if you have Internet access you can take the error code, do a little research on-line and within minutes get the the same or more information on how to solve your vehicles issues.  This little reader coupled with about 10 minutes of research online saved me  $500 dollars vs going to the dealership to solve the problem.  Lastly, this reader is really small and easily fits in the glovebox.  The only negative I found is that there is a little clip that locks the readers coupler to the computer plug in your car.  The first couple of times I used it I couldn't disconnect the reader.  I finally used a pliers to clip off the retention clip and haven't had any issues since.
B00BCRMB34|5|Thanks for good product and good service
B0068EQOH0|4|Works much better than stock shocks..
B00BUX6Q3Q|5|So sweet. Easy install!!
B00COYZU0K|5|Made my Chevy Silverado 1500 extended cab look bad ass
B00873J0YY|4|They went together a little rough. The fit and finish left something to be desired and the instructions consist of a single sheet of paper with a bad drawing on it. That said, if you're even a little bit handy and patient go ahead and get these. They mount well to our 2015 CR-V with the factory cross bars. Used both to take two kayaks, both 10 footers to the river with no problem. I used my own ratchet straps, but the ones that come with them work alright, I just like real ratcheting straps better. Got it up to about 55mph with no issues. I only strapped it to the actual racks and didn't bother with the front or rear straps like some people do. IMO that's overkill unless you're going a long way or the interstate. I'll post some pics when I use them next. My only concern would be someone stealing them while I'm paddling, you could always store them in the vehicle tho.
B00397YNL8|5|This upholstery cleaner worked fantastic on my Sanger Wakeboard boat.  It was recommended by the Upholstery installer where the boat is made.  It removed all of the grime and left a nice soft finish.  I applied 303 sunscreen when I was done cleaning the upholstery.
B001J7CO02|5|man this thing are very stronge, five stars
B004V3QBS2|1|PRODUCT WAS BAD DID NOT WORK
B00S09T8M4|5|My husband and I were so excited to try this. So we did a car wash and use this right away when it arrived. It is made of very soft material which makes us not to worry of making scartaches on the car.It makes soapy very fast. It is easy to ise because it is like gloves that u wear or put on you hand then your good to go.
B000ETAPX4|2|Your better off just buying the tree with the ice scent went through almost a whole can in a matter of weeks. does not linger like the tree you buy those seem to last a couple weeks.
B000C5C4QG|5|Worked perfectly on my son's '94 Explorer Sport. No issues.
B007HD4YD2|5|The Stickers are great .... and also the Service :-)
B0042B89X8|5|Great custom fit, very sturdy
B00DQJ8EO6|5|Just what I wanted!!!!
B004SJUFH2|5|Arrived in great shape, fit perfectly although minimal installation instructions would have been nice.
B001KR1BR8|5|as advertised
B000EDDTV0|5|Used this when replacing water pump on '05 camry.  No leaks, so must have worked.
B0036QOBOQ|3|In general I like the comfort and appearance of this product. I have had the seat covers for about 2 months and they are starting to give-off an odor similar to a dead sheep (I suspect-never having actually smelled a dead sheep....this is probably close). I have tried ventilation, air fresheners, and dryer sheets as strategies to compensate for this odor, and they have not really worked well. I am open to suggestions, as I really like the covers-but hate the smell.
B00K65G71A|1|didnot seem to have long lasting improvement work soon after installation then faded
B00030D05Y|3|It was the wrong one and did not fit but I kept it and may be able to use it on other vehicles
B006GJRZ20|3|Good
B00ADXJNYS|5|Just as bright as any other light I've seen. I use two as visor lights in my car.
B008Y9KE7S|5|Work great and fit great. No problems with the install. Replaced a TYC that lasted about four years.
B0079SITWC|4|Not too expensive and they are functioning at the moment.  And the light travels so you can see way ahead  They failed after a few months
B003OXUPOQ|5|Great valve!
B006G62HUI|3|I wish I had gotten a wider one, and one that was NOT convex.  Normal rear-view mirrors are not wide angle for a reason. They magnify the view behind you and allow you to focus on JUST that.  This mirror, when I want to see what car is behind me, the cars are too small.
B002LQIP3K|5|Fixed allot of issues I didn't realize we're wrong until I replaced it
B004L0AAQY|4|Work great!
B00B7MZ2MG|5|Great for riding and don't let the cheap price fool you they are good glasses. But im not a guy that will spend 100 dollars Oakleys because they have an O on the side but that's just me
B000C93DVC|5|Quick ship and perfect fit
B0099PIXHY|5|this sticker is exactly as described, it came in very quickly and with no wrinkles or signs of damage. Now to put it on my buddies truck
B00R8GXFOW|5|It looks very attractive on my cay ,<br />Always get a lot of attentions.
B006ISNSBQ|1|Had serious problems getting the decal to stick to the glass on the vehicle.
B00UXRX5W0|1|IF I CAN PUT ZERO STAR!!! TOTALLY NOT FIT MY 2013 BMW 5.20dI!!! DO NOT BUY can be easily broke
B00HMZFHI6|4|Came in sooner than expected. Great to have around the garage.
B0007VND7Y|5|Fast Shipping, Great product, Excellent service.
B00RNCN9DI|5|We needed an exact size and color umbrella for our deck. I spent a lot of time on so many sites and couldn't find the size and/or color we needed. Then I found this one. PERFECT!
B009HL6P3O|4|Great replacement belt fits my 2012 Polaris 800xp fine ...but it is not the carbon belt as the description indicates but it will work for now...
B0016I8E1M|5|Arrived in great condition with UPS delivery.  All parts were there and the carrier went together smoothly.  Fit my hitch perfectly, just don't slide in too far if your hitch receiver is rusty or corroded, it can be difficulty to adjust to align the hitch pin holes.  Sure beats getting the inside of my truck all bloody! Great product- very sturdy!
B008ESJQQY|5|I love it
B007OW6M0Y|4|Genuine toyota
B00DBEOWAQ|1|I thought there was a standard brightness for backup lights but I see now that I have put them in that they are not bright enough for the job, which is the reason I wanted new bulbs, they dont provide the brightness I was hoping for, not even close, the old filament ones were better, unfortunately a waste of time, money and energy, the least this seller could have done is disclose the brightness level in their description, shame on bad bad business paracticers
B00A54HCFC|5|Sturdy jack stands, creeper feels cheap, but jack is nice.
B00W73I4II|1|This does not fit a Honda XR100R. The filter is too long, the bolts are not the right size and the tank fitting is wrong.
B000EVWDU0|5|Has promissed, make my trips more secure, i suposse no to have to worry about batteri foults again... this time i am prepared...
B0002JN2EU|5|Have used this product on my Motorcycle, snowblower, lawnmower, and car. Been around for many years. Works!
B0058TF7GK|1|Too loose and doesn't snap well. Also the hooks come off the net too easily. I did not use it to secure my load because I couldn't get it to stay on. I purchased it because it is supposed to fit my Curt rack perfectly, but it doesn't.
B005948U7C|5|just what i wanted , they woork very good
B001NND78U|5|Quick shipment this product is as described ,will order again
B002ZLH5X2|5|My 5 year old has been using these on his little 4 wheeler now for over 7 months and they have held up well. They wash up great and don't slip while wearing them.
B009NOZ4SC|5|Powerful and brilliant lighting
B000COU1VC|4|Easy to get to in tight places. Looks good on engine too.
B007OSL3DY|5|Does the trick.
B00E1EY6HY|4|We still had to drill holes to completely match up to our 2012 silverado 3/4 ton. But other than that it was good.
B00GHQLPZK|5|Worked perfectly
B00E9LP7WW|1|Horrible product!!!
B00FBKW6R4|1|It didn't work for my car the head light connector piece was way too deep too make connection.
B00UJRH0LQ|5|Worked as expected
B0002Z9NYM|5|excellent solution for collectors for my mustang gt exhaust
B0010E00T6|5|This is fit to 2012 Honda Accord LX. I satisfied with this item.
B00BHM592O|5|Item work will and was shipped on time.
B000GU3LU0|5|It will save the tank finish on my Viffer for sure and sort of matches my Corbin Saddle.
B006RUJ2D8|5|Million times better than Goo-Gone. Per the rv forum recommendations, I used this to get the adhesive off old, sun-baked RV decals. Heat-gun & actual decal removal was the bulk of the task. The glue removal was the easy part thanks to this stuff. You do have to used quite a bit of it though. I went through two bottles on a 22' Toy Hauler. Follow the instructions and don't let it sit too long or you'll have to re-spray and the stuff isn't cheap. Highly recommended and made a time consuming task that much easier.
B00K7XNEE4|2|White letter touched the black background.
B002GV3026|5|Perfect fit and good looking. Thanks
B000RDG82E|5|Installed sensor and it works great.
B0021EHOZM|4|perfect fit
B0007Y7Q6U|5|great deal
B001CA8PUY|5|Perfect replacement.  Castle nut and accessories included.  Good packaging.
B00PV37ZEA|5|Awesome product. Very durable and serves its purpose. I'm not a huge fan of the brown. It would be nicer in black
B000CPAV8Y|5|Went on easy, clean. Honestly it's truly all in your prep work.  Sprayed whole engine, using VHT gloss black for final color.
B009EK6Y2K|4|Cheap parts fast. Thank Goodness for AC
B00NXF0T46|3|not as bright as i thought they would be. im 15 and driving next year and i own a 1968 mustang and i thought that having these would ad a little pzazz but the plug is flimsy and well they dont really fit in the cigarette lighter in my car because well it was actually designed to light cigarettes but they work and you can see them well at night so buy at your own risk
B00KYGOADI|1|Quality is very poor!
B004WO681U|4|Good could use better instrusions tho
B007HRSIDU|5|Work so good and fit perfect. Work so good ordered another one for back up. Good PRICE also compared to other companies.
B000CITD5I|5|02 Eddie,  5.4 dual gibson exhaust, steel k&n cold air intake, jet throttle body spacer.  I bolt this on and it wakes up.  More response,  better mpg, idle, cruise all around.
B004D5Q2V4|5|Runs really nicely on my 1988 Cherokee 4.0.
B007FHS954|5|Looks nice perfect fit  for my 07 cbr 600 rr
B0106PM6XW|1|Shade is too flimsy. It would not stay in the windshield. Returned it.
B001Q4XIHG|5|strong and sturdy.
B001JT1CEE|5|A+
B00DR15LOO|5|great top, things got kind of screwy in the shipping but it was rectified quickly. Will be ordering one for my sebring shortly.
B005EDO8YM|4|Great covers but were a bit complicated to put on
B005HAP2YW|5|Fixed my hvac controls, hot and cold air switching with ease. :D
B000AS3D3S|5|Great,  I mean great filter.  I could feel the difference in driving and see it on the dip stick.  Keeping oil cleaner.
B000EDUTN6|5|Works well, as advertized.
B003SS62PS|1|Worked fine for 10 days then never worked again.
B0076OVSDQ|5|Exactly what I needed.
B00B5ZY07I|5|Excellent! Exactly what I was looking for. Aged the perfect touch to the custom plates I ordered.
B00SOGLTBQ|1|Literally broke both mirrors upon installation.... The plastic that actually holds the mirror is not capable of even twisting 1/4&#34; before it snaps .... Then the right mirror shattered once I tried to adjust that. Very upset with this purchase. Anybody want some junk mirrors these are it!
B00KTHZZ3Q|5|I ordered it with little hope of working and to my surprise. I got it and had it programed by a locksmith. It only took him 5 minutes and it works great. It does fit a little tight in the switch, but it does fit and work fine.
B00DJ5KEF4|5|Works great, small, convenient and very practical.
B001PYCJRC|5|This fits my 2004 Hyundai Elantra (Avante) perfectly. The sales image is misleading because the reservoir and line to the clutch master cylinder was not included with the product. Nonetheless, the cylinder was easy to install and has given me a bit of a firmer clutch feel compared to the old and leaking cylinder.
B0033QVL9C|5|Replaced coolant on 2003 Super duty with powerstroke. Recommended coolant at great price
B005NLQAHS|5|Bought for my 2001 Mustang GT, and 2003 Evo 8.<br /><br />Works great. There is a bit of lag but that's just bluetooth.  Paired with Torque app it's a must have.  Has saved me and my family some money reading the codes that come up.
B000HBM5S2|5|Best stuff out there. Use it on the rails of my car sunroof...both cleans and lubricates  the rails. Way way better than that product that starts with a &#34;W&#34;
B000C9HAVG|5|This is by far better that. Any aftermarket expansion valve... for the simple family to that it has a screen built inside it to catch any metal particles that float through. Aftermarket ones do not have that one crucial piece.
B0018EUDHW|2|Have attempted to use this item on 4 different flats and it has yet to make a complete seal. I end up using another plug kit with sticky plugs. I had high hopes because it looked so much easier but no it sucked. I have owned this for over 6 months. Don't waste your money.
B00SI6NPS2|5|Very nice fit..thank you
B00G3Z0V6O|1|This does not fit Hyundai Elantra GT 2013. If your stuck with it, transfer the rubber gasket off the old filter and then it will work.
B004NTOCQM|4|basically a walbro fuel pump. Came in installed it but it was not a direct fit, needed new holes for the fuel pump base for it to fit on my Ford Ranger 2001 3.0 (was a bit longer than stock) and needed the side of the base cut because of the strainer. also had to crimp connections together (make sure to use gas resistant heatshrink or cover for the crimp or soldered connections! However, ive had it for a few months and no complaints! works great! Ill have to see how it holds up once the vehicle is boosted and desires more fuel
B00KWS2WGU|1|Right hand mirror was not reverse threaded like it is supposed to be. I ended up breaking the post off of the original mirrors on my 2007 vmax trying to remove it the normal way because I was basing my judgment off the incorrect threads on the ones that I received. Now I'm looking at hundreds of dollars of repair work, plus a big delay getting my bike sold. Mine were sold by XYZCTEM.
B004PXWKLA|5|yes
B00OXBTWK6|5|Great quality, clever design for valet key. My boyfriend loved it!
B00C3078PU|4|Excellent price and the product was better than expected. Way better value than paying Harley prices.
B00KB8LQUO|5|These are exactly what my husband wanted for his 1930 Ford Coupe.  He is very satisfied.
B00CA95B7Q|5|Fits like a glove, will be putting them to the test this weekend.
B002FUO3ZG|5|Looks fantastic and the sound is very noticeable. The packaging was very good as well. Very happy.
B00122EEK2|4|Got the yellow light turned ON for my Honda Accord 2004. Got it checked by mechanic and gave me the codes and mentioned that its because of the oxygen sensor. I got this online and got it set in my car. It worked perfectly. So far i dont have any issues with the yellow light turning ON.<br />I would recommend this.
B00HR7UJGE|4|finally used them.  They both work.  The connectors are standard AMPS connectors used on all these aftermarket HID kit bulbs.  I'm not sure what that one comment was about.
B0045V8CKU|5|Excellent rails, much cheaper and very easy to install!
B0067UKD5Y|1|False info. Does NOT fit a Jeep Liberty. Does not. Waste of money and now I can't return. Pissed off.<br />I am beginning to hesitate ordering car parts that are continually wrong and have to send them back especially when they say it will fit.
B009ZIJH16|3|Too small
B006T3MLFY|5|I started the project at 8:00 not realizing sunset was at 8:35, but finished up right at 8:35.<br /><br />Measuring and cutting the roof strips was the most time consuming part- actually flipping on my smartphone form the manual to a mm to inches online converter took as much time as the cutting- I think if you cut within 1/8 or so of the exact spot- you will be ok.<br /><br />At first I worried when a couple of the roof strips snapped/broke when I removed the strip, then i wasted time carefully removing them.  You only need 2 good ones and those come with the kit - so just rip out the connectors - no need to carefully use needle nose pliers.<br /><br />Take a moment to assemble, the rack, place the front roof strip back using the connector, and lay the other straps in place.  Align the rack with the holes, insert the fat head screws a couple turn, then tighten them all.  snap the covers into place<br /><br />so now, I'm happy, like a room with a roof ---rack...
B00IQFDKKS|5|amazing deal work awesome so far
B00279BFCY|5|Great quality product, identical to the one I replaced in my Pontiac G6, fit like a glove. would buy another, great price... was quoted for the job @ 500.00, rape job, the most you should of paid is 300.00 if that... so I did it myself it took roughly 1 to 2 hrs. and it was done... saved me tons of money and I didn't even have to pull out my power tools...
B00OTDVS32|5|very good. installed on a family members e46 2002, and it looked and fit great.
B00KAKEN3A|5|Love it. Came very quick
B005JU5UMO|5|Works great and has been durable so far after 3 months.
B012BL2RXS|4|Review of this device vs. the HyperPS 20000mah Multi-function Vehicle Car Jump Starter.  For more detail on HyperPS, see my review on that device.<br /><br />The appealed because it has the highest MAh of any I could find.  Also, I liked the digital display.  Although better than the HyperPS, the included instructions weren't very comprehensive, but it's pretty intuitive.  The LBI has flashlight and blink/SOS mode and a red row of flashing LEDs that all work as expected, whereas with the HyperPS, the one thing I could not get working was the flashlight on blinking / SOS display.<br /><br />This is a very nice battery, although it is a bit larger and 33% more expensive than the HyperPS (also rated with an extra 1000 MAh).  But I really liked the digital readout better than the HyperPS's version of 'bleed over' LEDs.  Like the HyperPS, there is only one button on this model too (aside from the power slider), but it seems to work much more certainly.<br /><br />The compressor was not as good as HyperPS; its gauge reads up to 80 psi; when got to 80 filling my bike tire, it shut off.  Compare to the HyperPS which reads to 150 PSI and it had no problem doing my bicycle tire to or past 90 psi, and has a longer air hose.  But attempting to use either on a car tire that already had 37 psi, it seemed to gain only VERY slowly if at all. On a tire that had only 20-25 lbs, they both filled to 40, but HyperPS took about 5 minutes and the LB1 took closer to 15 or more.  If you intend to use the compressor quite a lot, HyperPS wins.<br /><br />Although I did not care to kill my battery (using Toyota Tacoma), I disconnected it and tried to jump using each.  Both batteries performed the same, able to start the car more times than I cared to try (about a half dozen) without noticeable battery drain.  Starting was not what I would call &#34;peppy&#34;; the battery has much better cold cranking amps of course.  But they both worked fine.<br /><br />Both include many adaptors, some differences:<br /><br />LBI: One USB -&#62; phone with iPhone, old iPhone, Micro & Mini USB.  Several round 12 volt / Laptop adaptors.<br /><br />HyperPS: A bag a phone adaptors, most of which look like they belong to long-obsolete phones. Old iPhone adaptor, but not new, Micro USB but not Mini.  Several round 12 volt / Laptop adaptors (but one appeared to be missing).  Lack of new iPhone or Mini USB likely not so important since you can plug in anything of your own to the USB out.<br /><br />Winner for me LB1, because I am not concerned about the slightly larger size or price, and I like the power readout as I will largely be using it to supplant power for my mobile bluetooth speaker.  I like the adaptors better, but the compressor, though smaller, is slower, at least on car tires.  LB1 also just seems a bit more thoughtfully constructed.
B00P5YNMA6|5|Very good product
B00BB1UMEG|5|Outstanding.  These liners are a perfect fit in our 2015 4Runner.  The quality of the material appears to be excellent, and like I said, they fit perfectly.  Highly recommended.
B00GTYV8KM|1|The whole product didn't fit in my car. The shape of the lense was wrong, the rubber didn't want to work. I got it snapped in place, then went to put the screws in the back side and heard a click, and the light shifted. When I looked at the lense thinking it had popped out I found the the lense had broken. Wouldn't buy this product again.  Wish I could get my money back but it broke while I was putting it in.
B000BPTVTK|5|Would not leave home without it
B00OT7IZ0W|2|Wires are about the size of strands of hair
B00SGFZCTA|5|I love this keychain.  I really like the ease of removing a key when necessary yet the keys are secure otherwise.  Also, nicely packaged.
B00QXXFSAK|5|Excellent product, arrived in time. Same product in the picture.
B000CCFFRE|4|I ordered this rack on Friday and received it on Saturday.  You gotta love Amazon Prime! The rack doesn't seem to be made with highest grade materials.  However, the price is right, it seems plenty strong, installation took barely half a beer, and the lightweight materials are actually a good thing when you're putting it on a lightweight sports car.  I actually chose this one because the real estate seems to be the most expansive of the available racks for my car.  Oh, and about hat big gaping hole in the middle with no cross bars? As Colin Chapman famously said &#34;Simplify, then add lightness.&#34;
B0043P6RD2|5|Quick shipping. Product as promised. Slightly spendy but I was glad to find it.
B002GCOV5K|4|Nice license plate frames. Purchased the 45th Anniversary plates for another one of my Mustangs. Only thing about these that makes me give them 4 stars instead of 5 like my previous Mustang frames is the Anniversary symbol is very light making it hard to see. All & all though, I would buy them again if I needed them.
B001AIZ5HY|5|I was skeptical about purchasing one of these kits and thought I would give it a try.  I can't believe how easy this system was to use.  Be sure to follow the directions and it will have your headlights looking like new in no time.  I do suggest being sure you have a 1,200 - 1,500 rpm CORDED drill.  My corded drill was less rpms than my cordless and I used a higher rpm on one light than the other which made a difference between the two.  The higher rpm headlight was like new while the lower rpm always seemed to have swirls in it, no matter how much I worked on it.
B00E3BSCHU|5|Had no problem with this antenna shipment was quick installation was easy good product
B00DMIAKKM|5|OE part for half the price of OEM - love it
B00HEPBLXE|5|Love it. Looks awesome. Just be prepared to destroy your OEM shift knob in the earlier Z's. You're gonna need hulk strength and vice grips to get it off
B000AMOEGY|5|Everyone of my family members car have this kit. So valuable. Thank you!
B002UKYKIG|5|FUN for my car. I get lots of waves .
B008D6UP3U|3|I purchased this frame on December 29th, 2014 and at first, loved it.  The rhinestones sparkled under sunlight and the frame was made very well.  Since that time I have had to replace 5 of the rhinestones due to them falling out. Upon inspection this evening, I noticed I had an additional 10 rhinestones missing.  Based on this, I took the frame off of my car as it looked tacky.  My car is handwashed the majority of the time, so I have attributed the rhinestones falling off due to the Texas heat.
B00GUBZYUY|5|Fit like a glove on my 2006 Trailblazer.
B002YQVIH2|5|Received it quickly and will be ordering another one for a friend.
B007HRRAJ8|1|Returned for missing parts
B00B2YE4B4|5|Perfect map light/reading light and they make my truck look very classy at night. The light is clear and white
B004975P0A|5|Worked fine. Fit perfectly.
B0035CRB52|5|This is my third Sinometer multimeter, they are great inexpensive meters for tinkerers. If you are someone that demands perfection and are a heavy user it might not be the meter for you, in that case bite the bullet and get a Fluke. I also own a Fluke but I do not use it for small tasks.
B00YWDTYEO|5|Bought it for my 2008 Nissan Xterra, looks great, good quality, comfortable, fits perfectly, and is overall a great buy. I would highly recommend.
B000P6UO2I|5|Worked well at hunting down a short in a harness. It does require some patience and time to get your issue sorted, but this makes it easier than having to tear everything apart inside of a car to source your issue.
B00OCEGTZA|5|Works perfect.
B004MUI7OA|5|NOTHING BUT PRAISE!!  This shade tree mechanic has had to work on more than one boy friend's car and thank goodness Amazon carries the best priced parts.  I dropped this same part into a Nissan Altima and later a Chrysler Sebring.  Fits like it was factory stock.  I had to reuse the original plastic screen in the Altima but it cleaned up well so no worries about reliability.  I continue to tell these younger generations that doing the research for parts and then replacing them is a very rewarding experience.  It is one thing that builds confidence yourself while saving a bunch of money in labor charges.  I saw the soap box and had to step on it.
B00KX35HTS|5|Awesome
B00SZK1G2I|5|Great products and customer service from this company. I will be buying more LED's from this place. Highly recommended!!!
B00XPL88NC|5|I used it today on my 2 cars and my 2 golf carts and by far this was the easiest in use and consistently most accurate gauge I have ever used. 5 Stars *****
B00XVZYTLM|4|really like the lights,makes my trailer a lot brighter
B001UG4WIO|5|It is nice and I have had it for a few months and it has held up exceptionally to the weather. It is nice because I drive a Toyota Prius and there are so many on the road now that in a parking lot the Symbol of the Jedi Order draws me to my vehicle...
B00JBVB1W0|5|Great lights super bright and received faat. I am using these lights on my boat for spot lights while running in back water areas at night and also for bow fishing. They work great.
B000E7H3RC|3|does it's job, probably extended the life of my filter by at least a year.
B002E1AYYA|5|this was purchased to pull chain link fence tight during installation and it worked very well. Would purchase again
B008HXQS5S|1|I bought this one and also another brand (the classic black ones).  I installed all 4 to the front of my RV before my last roadtrip.  The surface was cleaned properly, etc.  Half way through my trip, I noticed BOTH of the Superex ones fell off.  Unless these work just laying on the side of the road somewhere, do not buy them.  The other brand that I bought are still on there.  Cheaping out on adhesive on a product that is suppose to stick to work isn't very smart.
B00FXA7X0W|5|Nice cables for the price.  Maybe not for continuous heavy duty use, but an occasional jump start is no problems.  I prefer this size cable to to keep in the vehicle due to the more compact size.  Plus these came with a storage bag, so a nice little package
B000CPI5ZK|3|I added this stuff to 2 cars in an effort to combat the NC summer heat.  I've noticed no difference in operating temperature in either.  It did seem to help in another car.  The jury is still out on whether I buy again.
B00X65LGNQ|4|GREAT HELMET.
B0002NYC0E|1|is bad because i try to order another one and the price was 3times more compare to the first time
B00U8695HK|5|So far I love it. My car smells of nothing when I get back in it. Just wish I had something for my house that works this great. Hey.. maybe I will research that! I am a smoker.
B005H12QXG|5|I love the mirrors. That worked out great and were easy to install
B009FUF6DM|4|Thinner than the walmart brand, but ok for waxing and washing a car.  Due to being thin , will not hold a lot of water.  Worth the money because of prime and free shipping. Would not buy again.
B00KJLLJL4|1|Poor quality
B00AJ1TWT0|5|Works great! Fixed my machine gun lock issue on my 2000 ML320 driver's door.
B004JY6AVQ|4|I assembled this but the problem was resolved another way so now it's a spare.  If your key has wear that may affect it to the degree that you need to file the tangs down.  There are several very helpful YouTube videos.
B00VNBEJ1G|5|Fantastic customer service and product. I tested these prior to installation as suggested and they worked great. Quite blinding and will leave a blue dot in front of your face for awhile. I installed them just like any other headlight and they looked great before I started the engine but when I started the engine one blew partially. Not enough that I couldn't use it until replaced but one led definitely blew. I contacted customer service through Amazon and they promptly sent me a new one with free return shipping label. Very quick turnover. They were apologetic and I was very happy with the service and the performance of these lights. I usually don't like the hassle of returning things and will usually take a loss and get another product but the one that worked worked so good I had to give these a shot. Very happy even after the dud. I provided a look at stock halogen light vs the LED. Faaaaaaar brighter
B000C5HRGS|5|I bought this to use with the 'Mishimoto Ford 6.0L Powerstroke High-Temperature Thermostat, Part# MMTS-F2D-03H'. Fits and seals perfect.
B00F66SMAS|5|Purchased this a few months back ... brand new center piece, fit perfectly on a 2003 Nissan Xterra 3.3 engine, 16 inch wheels ... I will eventually use this seller to replace the other 3.... thanks a bunch!
B00GI2I6UK|5|Loooooove them
B000CON1ZU|5|I'll begin this review by saying, I do not get paid for this or even get free stuff from amazon.  Just a normal dad buying stuff online and writing honest reviews.  I won't hold back on my review if something sucks and often update my reviews as time goes on.  I hate buying something and finding out after it was a bad purchase and full of phony reviews.<br /><br />it's a moroso clamp.  It works.  No complaints.  You get exactly what's pictured, nothing else.
B002EOZG8G|5|Nice fit and easy to install.
B00EZJBELQ|4|A+
B00X4PLTT4|4|Fast delivery, part was exactly what was ecpected.
B000C9SC5E|5|These fit in the springs to compensate if one side of the car is sitting higher or lower than the other.  You must be certain to get the right size.  That is the size of the actual coil (diameter of steel) so these can clip on, and do you want one to raiser or lower.  There are shorter ones and taller ones to spread the coils, or compress them, so my advice is that you do not do this unless you know exactly what you are doing.  This might be better done by a suspension shop.  If you want to do it, get the correct size, and make sure you have a floor jack, jack stands, and spring compressors---good luck!
B0050EILKC|2|Used it once and there is already a bubble  of good size in the abrasive covering
B00PG6BR32|5|I love this jacket, protects well from the cold of winter, When you go over 100km run is lie on the bike because if you're driving normally, the air will hit it hard.
B000E28KV0|5|Works great.  Just takes a while to get it seated on my KLR, but be patient and careful, and it'll seat fine.  I've always used K and N filters on my vehicles, and will continue to.
B00AXLN1QG|5|These fit perfectly in my 2004 Chevy Suburban.  Saving up for a set for my Tahoe, as well as the back seat in the Suburban.
B004UW8SS0|5|Great product for a great price
B00O0NA0IA|5|Great!
B00K2HYSOK|2|WRONG IMAGE.<br />the bell itself is a good quality, but its not what is pictured.<br />attached a photo of what the bell actually looks like.
B00O8ZNJ2Y|5|Exactly what I expected. Great color.
B00K8VQE7Y|4|Beautiful and colorful, well made, but a bit too small for my son's car.
B00OFIOI6K|5|Exactly what I needed!
B009F5D8WS|5|The hitch fit my Dodge Journey, just as it was a supposed to. No problem. The Dodge dealer installed it and it looks good! A mopar hitch was over 400 dollars, the Reese was 134. No further comment needed
B00861EKEW|5|Everything worked great.
B0042Z307E|4|Exactly what I ordered. Shipped as promised
B003VASDL4|5|Good quality.
B00OG7A40E|1|We ordered this and installed it ourselves. It would have been fine if the right instructions would have been sent. The repairmen looked at it and said well you followed them and did what it said but I don't know what's wrong. So he looked up the instructions he had and sure enough our instructions and his didn't match. He switched a few things around and it was fixed. It cost us several hundred dollars for the repair that we would not of had to spend if we had just been given the correct instructions. I called to complain and was told I needed to get in touch with Mopar to make a complaint. The only problem<br />With that is we can't find any contact information for Mopar.
B003IHMHLW|5|very good
B005A3YEKY|5|Excelente
B004LF6LFI|4|fit my dual axle car trailer perfectly. didn't need to tie them off as in the instructions- they seem to stay on fine
B00KMI3XPY|5|This pump is used for waste oil extraction from diesel engines.  It performed as well as the much more expensive pumps having longer intervals for pumping.  The 30 minute length of this pump is plenty for the quantity of waste oil pumped at one time (26 quarts).<br />A good product at a fair price.
B00464B4CO|5|Very well made wiper blades.  Nice clean sweep without any chatter or missed spots.  One thing to consider.  If using these for our 2006 BMW 325i (e90) did pose one minor problem.  The covers for the wipers (covers where the wiper blades connect to the wiper arm) cannot be used with these blades.  The metal is too wide for the covers.  I don't think they will fall off, but it doesn't look as good with the covers missing.  So, the trade off is for either better quality of better looks.
B00BJF0DUM|5|Worked as promised.  Came delivered in excellent condition.
B000630AII|5|Registered a 1.2 mpg increase on my in dash readout for the is300. Cleans up easy with the K&N kit to refresh twice a year.
B00CZF5HC4|5|Very bright. Easy to install
B001DKV5H8|5|Very good product. Brilliant
B00CJDDX5K|5|Super great
B0049ATA58|1|Mirror is smaller than oem mirror, loose fitting.
B0002SA316|5|I bought this for my husband and he loves it.
B004I8O7J0|5|Perfect fit...easy 20 minute install
B00APO9Y6C|5|Looks great on my pickup thank you !!!!
B00B2ATTUE|4|it is doing what it was made for.
B0039Z1UHA|5|AMAZING!!!
B005PZMLDY|4|Good cover
B002JATYOC|4|It fit and i like them
B00418U0AM|5|The Mickey Mouse decal definitely met my expectations.
B00GWWVTEG|5|Bien chingones
B0093DSYZ8|1|I believe it is leaking by the bearings ??  You could have some one call.
B000F9HORS|5|Fit as advertised.  Took the precaution of adding two extra hangers, one for each dual.  Nice mellow sound.
B0019ZXMB4|5|Delivered fast and product was a great quality!
B00F5MUB66|2|It was easy to install but the hose is very stiff and the sliding button to reduce flow fell apart after the second use.  It's also leaking out of the silver band on the shower head. It looks nice and has great flow/pressure but it's poorly made.  I would recommend that you keep looking because I'm sure there are better shower heads out there.  This one doesn't cut it!
B004I18M4I|5|Very pleased. Will order products  again.
B00O6FSH8W|5|they are great
B00NBDOT28|5|great price, perfect fit.
B000HS8PB6|5|Fits and works like it should
B00M1Y3NU2|5|Power steering fluid for 2007 Ford Expedition EL Limited (5.4L 3v v8)<br /><br />Cheaper and more available than motorcraft brand, but officially licensed to product oil to Mercon V spec.<br /><br />Since I bought the box and only needed 3 1/2, I use this oil for other things like my hydraulic car jack and other light duty lubrication duties around the house. Buying this box of 12 was cheaper than buying 4 motorcraft branded oil
B0040UI0TO|5|I bought my dad this for Christmas. It fit perfectly on his truck and the color is still great after three years. Thank you amazon
B000FEWAMM|2|Fell apart after one use
B00AB2C8QG|3|Meh.<br />As with the three stars...its ok.<br />It fits fine atop the glove box lid and it does give me a spot to put my pocket camera to have within easy reach, but that's about it.<br />I would pay more for the same item if only it was made of a nicer material; not really a fan of the &#34;faux&#34; leather plastic vinyl this is made of. But I was in a hurry and needed something for a trip I was headed out on, so it did serve it's purpose.
B00IJEA7IY|5|nothing to say really..its as it should be.
B007OW62J0|5|No problems replacing the sir filter on my 2011 4 Runner Limited. Very fast delivery.
B002R38TCE|5|It is a very soft brush, and it works well with the 303 Soft Top Fabric cleaner. I've only used it twice on my new Miata MX-5.  It is still losing hairs, but it works great.
B00DSD50JW|5|Very nice.
B000CCFJH0|5|Bolt on with no issues whatsoever. Noticeable increase at higher rpms.
B004I0LI0O|5|fit correctly. Good.
B00062Z0WA|5|Just installed this K&N filter as a replacement filter in my Porsche. Couldn't be happier with the simplicity of installation, and I can tell the difference in both sound and response during acceleration. While K&N recommends cleaning at 100k miles, I will do it after every oil change. A great product.
B00AFV7DI6|5|Perfect fit for my 2014 RAM 1500 outdoorsman.
B001GF2RKO|4|Keeps the sun from ruining the dashboard and front seats
B000BRQ0TW|4|At first, I was concerned about the thickness of the material. Quite unlike any other epoxy that I've used, this stuff is like a putty. You must knead it, not stir it. Repaired a broken PVC irrigation line, which is under water. It's been a couple of weeks, & so far, so good! I am pleasantly surprised!
B00FSD37CM|5|I bought this for my AR build.  Mil spec.  It's a large amount for just one build but I'm sure I can find some more uses for this grease.  Product is great.  Knowing that I was using the mil spec recommended grease gave me great peice of mind.
B008G1Z190|5|Fit perfectly and look nice
B00NMAH5EO|5|no problems here.
B009FZWF3Q|5|Used this set of blue LED's to illuminate the foot wells of my Polaris RZR. Wiring is a bit thin and cheap but that is liveable. The lights work great and illuminate the foot wells very good. Good product for the price.
B00GFGVSY0|5|Best oil in the world and it's from the USA.
B0008FUF9S|5|good buy
B00U9YLVAU|1|I was expecting good quality but is not . The sticker keep coming off not good at all
B00IJKGXS6|4|looks great, a little hard to put on, that's why its not a 5 rate
B00103MC2A|4|Easy to install. Works great so far.
B009IFIMH6|5|This fit my vehicle perfect.
B00BKW444A|5|Everything worked as advertised,would highly commend this product.
B002JBDH26|5|Great
B000C2WF0E|4|At fist it was very tight.  I am very satisfied.
B0031BHZQW|4|These pipe are great when you take out the baffle
B00HESFIJ4|5|I'm glad I found this, it's the best gage and a very good price.
B0055AW0N0|5|Inexpensive and easy to use.  Very happy with purchase.
B0040CRTK8|5|These things work great, half of mine were busted and these fit fine. Simply take your old or broken clips out and slide these babies in.
B000TYQB14|5|Perfect fit!!
B003WGRNBI|1|does not fit in a 2003 MR2. Had to return.
B00SCJLS5M|5|I enjoyed every item!!!!!!😊
B001AMEE4K|5|OEM product quality, fixed the bumping of the rear strut when traveling over pot holes....
B000C995NM|5|GREAT!
B00V3YUHK0|5|GREAT PRODUCT!!!!
B00UG48G56|5|Works like expected... stops well, quietly.
B0054JV40C|5|OEM supplier to Audi/VW. No issues as should be expected.  Ordered this one to replace a cheep aftermarket bearing that failed within 1500 miles.
B00GA3BBBS|4|At my 183cm height, even with the stock windscreen at  its highest setting I still felt a lot of wind noise & buffeting. With the deflector fitted it's much quieter and less windy, however a howl develops above 90km/h.
B00A448NYW|5|Wonderful product. Wiring was simple enough (instructions were useless) all the leds work
B00279BFCY|5|Perfect fit for the vehicle...
B006K8GPHI|5|I use these as dinner napkins, and they work perfectly.
B0031BUDSO|5|Very good bag does very well
B006FUT09G|5|I use this for my auto only.
B00VSHMN22|5|I love these lights. I get compliments everywhere I go. Instructions were not the most clear specifically when explaining where to tap into power for the halo lights. I ended up doing a fuse tap and getting power from there. They are bright night or day!
B001J5WW5Q|1|The first set was defective , same as the second set ... I will make sure to return then
B008HIVXK8|5|Of all the Zombie permit stickers out there, this one is best.
B000CF8W1W|5|great
B005CW9MUA|5|Great upgrade for stock TC88 inner cam bearings without the HD brand tax.
B00KZD8ME8|5|Very easy to install and people think they are cool  Obviously can't see during the day.
B000ER46RM|1|Fell off 2 minutes after putting it on and it feels like the cheep plastic it is they couldn't even be bothered trimming the sharp edges
B002R0R52C|5|Perfect fit (2001 RAV4) and even came with an lightbulb installed
B004R6E1FS|5|I love the look on my car windows
B000C984Z2|5|I had encountered AC belt noises specially when you start your AC in a hot day and lost few belt cause of this. I have replaced my AC compressor and AC belt tensioned and now I can feel the difference. NO MORE ISSUES with my AC.<br /> I enjoy drive my car with ICY cold AC in a hot day.
B00DRBDH5O|4|Great upgrade to the stock exhaust on my 2012 Yamaha FZ8.<br /><br />Sound: Very loud.  Deep at low rpms, gets higher around 7k rpms but not that annoying tuner exhaust high pitched sound.  I live in MA where there is a decibel limit so I added the P1X tip to lower the dbs by about 10dbs.  The sound isnt as loud but it is deeper at higher rpms.  I prefer the sound with the tip as it is not overbearing and I can still hear my music on my Uclear.<br /><br />Install: If the bolts for my factory muffler hanger weren't over tightened to the point I had to cut them off, I could have done the install in under 30 minutes.<br /><br />Other: I probably dropped around 20 pounds of weight with the switch.  I also get compliments on the sound.  10/10 recommend with the P1X tip, especially if you live in a regulated state.
B000B8WMAW|5|Got these as gifts for an older couple with RV. They love them. Super comfortable.
B0012Q84BS|5|Great product for a great price.  Completely satisfied!
B000CCOL3I|5|This product does what it claims. The best fuel system cleaner you can buy.
B00YB5GAEA|5|35 years a cyclist (competitive road racing/triathlon) & casual, the &#34;Blitzu&#34; far outranks any tail light I've ever used. Its 3rd option, pulse, works for me & gets the attention of those behind. Its superior construction is top notch. A bonus of a USB port is found within an otherwise battery compartment on other tail lights. The light's adjustable strap fits snugly under the saddle (seat tube) or on recumbents & trikes, alike.
B001OBKD56|5|Good quality.  No noise on an XC90
B005M4R6P6|5|Made in the USA. SAE and DOT. Fit perfectly.

B00MYG359Q|5|Work out real great
B00U82MOLS|5|What can I say? The perfect accessory to my news 2015 Mustang Ecoboost in ruby red clear coat. Well made, good color and should last a long time. If you have a pony car, especially a 2015, you need this.
B007C7VERC|5|Worked fine
B00JIJ4LWW|1|Didn't clean  as I had hoped.
B00KL3ALGO|5|Works great, very happy with the purchase :)
B0077Q3SKE|5|I had to return as the car was sold.
B00H2VVM8E|5|I used this on top of my rusted van. I own a 1998 GMC Safari that that the paint started to crack as soon as the 3 year warranty was up on the paint job by the factory.  Well as you can imagine the top of the van had alot of surface rust after all those years. Used a wire wheel to get off most rust, cleaned with Por-15 degeaser and then used Por-15 metal prep.  No rust coming through after 6 month.  I live in wet south florida and can only do anything outdoors as my garage is full.  I do have Por-15 top coat to apply when it is dry.  Can't wait to get that on top.  FYI, I contacted GMC about the rust and they would do nothing, as they did when they were contacted in 2003.  I am a 55 yr old woman just trying to keep her van from rusting through.  I would recommend this product to anyone who doesn't have the money or want to give up a great running vehicle just because there is rust.
B00ALLUJ7W|3|This is a nice seat cover for an suv.  Easily washed and dried but beware that it snags very easily.
B00008RW9U|5|clean my car very well and more use more clean.
B00429NKWK|5|Great product. It works and is a bargain. No more cloudy headlights. It even removed the bad scratches I had.

B004OXEWSU|5|works perfect
B003PYAU0S|5|This is a good high quality product.  I highly recommend!
B00JW1WLAU|5|perfect fit
B0002NYBC8|5|I'm very happy with this product! It worked very fast. I've had an evaporator leak that would leak down in three days.<br />I tried a BARR's product that worked on one of my customers cars but it did not work on mine.<br />This product stopped the leak in 15 minutes of operation!<br />I did top off the system later but it worked for months now.<br />I also used Clip light on my home heat pump with great success!
B000CIKAPA|1|Didn't fit correctly. Removed and returned. What a waste of time.
B000QQXAMS|4|It works fine.
B00CHKQWGC|1|Doesn't spell anything like pizza!! It is disgusting! Maybe the smell is anchovies...... Gross. Don't by it
B000CFO0HW|5|easy install, solid craftsmanship, great product, fast shipping<br />nothing else to say
B00G4UWG84|5|For my 95 Miata, check to see if you have a 3 pin or 4 pin electrical connection. Mine is 4 pin, some models may take a 3 pin... It also doesn't have the grommet that the original part has. I took off the one from the old coil, still works for me... Otherwise after a tricky install, the part works great.
B00CHDIVFE|5|It fit perfectly!!
B00BRHM8FA|1|Terrible, Terrible, absolutely Terrible. 2014 lifted jeep, new tire size 325-60-18, needed to calibrate speedometer. The update down load from the web site was non existent, I tried 3 different computers, one with absolutely no anti virus,  no firewall , nothing that should have blocked the down load. I could not down load the update to save my life. I should have known this product would be a problem from the minute I opened the box, the USB connection for the flashcal is an archaic plug, I think the only people still using this plug and cable is superchips. Tech support tried to suggest using a different USB cable, ya right if your still using an Nokia cell phone! they were useless. The Jeep forums  were of some help , but not enough to complete the download. Approx time spent trying to download 10 hours.   So I tried to change the tire size with out the update, hey why not. Well that didn't work either. It never matched the speedometer correctly, I had two GPS speed apps running at the same time giving me exactly the same speed, unfortunately my speedometer was off , by 2 MPH the first time, 4 MPH the second, and 5 MPH the third, by the fourth change of tire size, it did not change the speedometer at all. Final thoughts, for $140 bucks and some change, you would think a company would be up to date with ALL their software, let alone their plug ins/USB cables. Keep your money from this company and move on. I am now going to spend an additional $20-30 bucks for the AEV Procal, hopefully we'll have better luck. I have sent this product back to Amazon for a refund. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME, ESPECIALLY YOUR MONEY.
B00BTIN7SO|5|This is a very high quality bike seat. It's very comfortable to sit on and the back rest is a nice touch. Mounting the seat is easy and be accomplished using only an adjustable wrench. The price is worth every penny. The seat back is adjustable up or down but not back or forward.. Still it feels good and have no complaints and would not understand any negative review.
B00I9FYD1K|5|Arrived as expected
B008VQPLR2|5|nice
B00XRBV8FK|4|Absolutely love the look of the lights had to do some work on getting lights to fit perfectly but they look awesome on my 2010 Silverado don't like that they do not come with a led reverse light had to spend another 30 bucks
B00B1UYSEW|5|it fit just fine no problem.
B005TTZ714|5|A must have for the trail, really makes a stock suspension system &#34;trail rated&#34; and much better/cheaper than bending your sway bar by not disconnecting
B000C9QBHA|5|The stock oil fill cap on my 2014 Z-51 Corvette stated  &#34;Dexos&#34; on it and General Motors has determined that Mobil 1 is the oil to use for all 2014 and up Corvettes, so wanting to  take every precaution to ensure that the dealership would put in Mobil 1 5w-30 Oil, I purchased this cap which says &#34;Mobil 1 5w 30&#34; on it.<br /><br />Fits perfect.
B00WJJJX0S|5|Excellent customer service and very quick replies. Cable is nice and strong. Very impressed with everything!
B00IABG8OI|5|Stronger, longer lasting material than original cover.
B00ZR2J06G|1|Does not work as advertised. Once installed and driven engine put out a code.<br />Tried to return and seller has not responded
B00JXZIV22|5|Awesome price. Fit perfect. Shipped quickly.
B005BNZFQ0|5|Exactly what I needed.  If you have a 120/240 outlet on your generator, you have 2 legs of power at probably around 30amps per leg, a neutral and a ground.  I didn't know that. Hopefully this information helps someone.
B00HJ15AEO|1|Broke after 2 car washes. Lousy design.
B000C2UCMM|5|I've been in the parts business since the 70's and ended my career working for CAT. Gates have always been a trusted name in the automotive field.
B001OK6Q2Q|5|good stuff
B00XVZJH82|5|I am seriously impressed! I don't usually give 5 stars but this throws of some serious light! Super bright, nice mounting brackets.
B00YQA7FFI|1|Bad pants the knee pads are below your knees
B0086JI9AU|4|Able to apply and remove with ease...thanks
B001RVEJSU|4|worked without any problems<br /> 2 weeks later all is still good
B004YWP8S4|4|A+++++
B00G3EIC6G|5|Tight and perfect fitting for my Brute Force 300. The wind will not take this one!
B000J41X0S|5|I have a Mazda 3 2007. Was so worried about buying this. BEST DECISION EVER! Fits my windshield PERFECTLY. Purposely bought this for when I was going down the shore with my family. My car sits outside next to the beach all day and then around 5:00 would have to drive to dinner and the car would be scorching hot. This really, REALLY helped! I was able to touch my steering wheel and seat belt no problem. Was humid (duh) but not blistering hot. I use it ALL the time now. Especially July in Jersey.<br /><br />Only con I have about it is that it is a tiny bit annoying (not difficult) to roll up. But really not hard at all. Sitting in your drivers seat just unroll it flat across you and the passenger and then slide it into the window. You don't even need to bring down your visors to hold it into place. Then, when un-doing it. Do the same. Slide it out of the window, and roll up back towards you. I throw it in my backseat a lot or have to put it in my trunk but for something so great in price that works, and fits my car perfectly - it's worth it to me!
B0058J4M5C|5|Very nice.
B00KTHY2DA|5|Worked perfectly for my 2004 Highlander.
B00V9CBIW2|3|Great fit and feel. The end caps suck. I cut them off and added another set of bar ends.
B001W9OP86|2|Covers r too big for my seats
B005FL332Q|4|Love em, no rust after 1 month !!
B0002SRCKG|5|Very well built and works great.  After breaking cheaper seal pullers I bought this one.  It's pulled the most stubborn seals without trouble or breaking in half.
B00KZJQ2L2|5|Fits perfectly on my Dodge Ram 2500.  I really like the added fabric around the edges to cover the whole front window.
B001HC48D0|4|doesn't fit between the rails , had to grind each side to latch the cover!!
B00008RW9V|5|This works as advertised. I like the fact that it is small. When you first use it, there is a wax residue that comes off on the car. Rest assured, a cloth towel will rub it away and there is no harm to your car. So don't freak out.This is mentioned in the pamphlet that comes with the duster.
B0010Z4MDK|5|Revitalized an old Belkin UPS with this battery.  Works great.  Once I discovered how easy it was to change out the battery on an APC UPS, I took a look at the Belkin and found a battery that looked like this.  Sure enough, it fit perfectly and gave new life to another expensive UPS for cheap.
B002V0AIWW|4|A good intro grease gun, but if you use it often you will need to replace the cartridge often,
B00H7RYTBU|5|Looks great and an easy install
B002VMSJ8U|5|This sticker is made to last the life of the car. Top quality and looks great.
B000JZEX72|5|Solve my problem and check engine light and i do have better fuel economy.
B00BFE4SHG|5|perfect
B001AS53EY|5|Very pleased. Quality item. Fast shipping. Thanks!
B00LNKZM90|3|Bought these original (OEM) splash guards instead of copies at less than half the price because they are external parts and I wanted them to fit perfectly. Well, the rears do, but not the fronts. The front splash guards need to be manipulated  with heat in order to be somewhat acceptable, but not perfect. I would advise to skip the fronts and just get the rears. The fronts are pretty small and don't do much anyway.
B000MW91RE|5|Could not find this product at home department store. Amazon always save the day, this sand paper is so light it is an add on only. Pretty reasonably price and it works how it should. I used this 2000grit on my car headlights after 400 and 600 grit to take out the yellowing of the headlights.
B0041037LY|5|Great. Beautiful
B004UTA5ES|5|great product,looks great,excellent quality

B0013REXSO|4|Good stuff! Fast shipping! Satisfied!
B008I7QYW0|5|A great purchase definitely recommend
B00W8H4KH2|5|Though I haven't tried it yet, I can say that the quality is amazing(thick, nice straight seams, sturdy). I didn't realize it had so much stuff(And so organized)!! Everything you need, like chargers and adapters, all kept in it's own strap. I love that there is a (Bright)flashlight in it also! It is currently in my truck, and I do feel a lot more 'prepared' for if something were to happen. I will be trying it out on a motorcycle soon(air compressor and jump starter), and I am more than certain it will perform wonderfully. I received this product in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />Update: Started the motorcycle swiftly, the boost button was extremely handy!! Perfect!
B00QMWQOHS|5|Great looking product!
B000RDJNJE|4|Like them but very soft metal don't put a wrench on them
B00EOTVDAE|5|Perfect size for the back window of my dog van.

B0079OPFLY|4|Good, and what was expected
B003X1VDIQ|5|Great product! Looks awesome now. Took all day to install but was worth it.
B003JYT3J8|5|My fiancé loved it and it was very easy to apply
B00D9C2CDO|5|WE love it. It is very versatile and can hold a lot more than you would think. Plus it is easy to remove and put in the truck so you are not stuck with a big ugly box on the car when you are at your destination.
