1587613379|4.0|While the book offers many humorous anecdotal examples of how polyamorous couples are able to successfully navigate the challenges of multi-partner pairing, I found the exercises that readers are supposed to complete with their partner(s) a bit lacking. In short, it is a useful tool for reinforcing or promoting the idea that it is not morally or biologically \\"better\\" to be strictly monogamous, but it is not the only literature to consider before making any lifestyle changes. Additionally, the topics of sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancies are not treated with appropriate seriousness, but instead are glazed over as minor impediments.

0439023513|5.0|...THIS is how you conclude a series.     Many people will gripe about how this book didn't turn out the way they wanted it to. That is because Mockingjay was realistic. It was realistic about war, death, destruction, and the effects these things can have on the human body and mind. People will be upset because this book was not just about her choosing between Gale and Peeta. Even her relationships with her men become warped by the war. This book is not Gale and Peeta running around without shirts on vying for Katniss's attention, it's not about everyone the main character loves surviving to live happily ever after.    What this means is that the reader is swept up with Katniss. We fall when she falls, rise when she rises. It means that one of your favorite characters probably doesn't survive. It means understanding the price of war, a fitting lesson for the world we live in today.    Brava, Collins, for taking risks and not going the safe route. It makes all the difference.

6305428557|5.0|Don't be put off by the title - [[ASIN:6305428557 The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain]] is a funny movie with a lot of soul. It's about a Welsh town that wants their local hill to be recorded as a mountain on the official cartographers' maps. So, what do they do? Pile a bunch of dirt on it until it becomes high enough to be considered a mountain!    The story is heart-warming and light-hearted at the same time. There are humorous moments (such as various plots to delay the cartographers from leaving town), but the movie revolves around the industriousness and pride of the villagers. Exemplifying their attitude is Morgan the Goat, played beautifully by Colm Meaney. Originally an outcast, he rouses the townsfolk toward greatness. His speech defending the decision to enlarge the hill has a humorously stirring ring to it - reminiscent of Braveheart... but without the weapons. The fire-and-brimstone preacher also ends up becoming an absolutely lovable character.    Hugh Grant also gives a good performance as the assistant cartographer. I'd warn Hugh Grant though fans that he doesn't come across as suave and sexy as he does in [[ASIN:B0002W4SWC Bridget Jones's Diary]]. Rather, he's a bit insecure and occasionally bumbling. It's nice to see that Grant can play those roles as well.    My only complaint with the DVD is that the sound quality is horrible. Already, it's difficult for American-English speakers to understand the thick Welsh accents. However, the dialogue is very soft throughout the movie and I had to turn my speakers up much louder than I ever had before. Then, in those one or two scenes when the sound reached normal volumes, they nearly shattered my ears because I had turned the speakers up! I hope that's something that could be fixed for a blu-ray release. It would also have helped not to have somebody with a thick Welsh accent narrate (I know the director was trying to give the movie a colloquial effect, but it was really tough to understand at points).    Overall, this is one of those movies that I'm truly glad to have discovered. Nowadays, when so much of what hits the cinemas is simply garbage, [[ASIN:6305428557 The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain]] reminds viewers of time when movies were supposed to tell a good story.

The book remains fantastic and gripping, but the Kindle edition has some of the most bush-league copy-editing I've ever had the displeasure of experiencing.  Character names sometimes change from sentence to sentence, important spellings are botched, and in at least one place (I'm only 25% through the book at this point) a sentence actually fails to end!<br /><br />Hopefully the publisher is already aware of these problems and is preparing an updated Kindle version.

B002ZG98LO|4.0|Predators was tasked with the impossible job of setting a bruised and battered series back on course while reminding people of the great film that christened the endeavor from the beginning. After the Aliens vs. Predator  films regulated the predators to bystanders in the sub-hack-and-slash horror genre, it had become evident that it was time for something different. I'm pleased to say that, while hardly the classic of the first film, Predators  manages to inject new life into a science fiction concept that is both exceedingly simple but also capable of a myriad amount of variation.    Predators begins with Royce (Adrien Brody) plummeting through the atmosphere, unconscious. He realizes that he has been equipped with a parachute that deploys automatically, saving us from an incredibly short film. Confused and lost, Royce finds himself in the middle of an unknown jungle, but still armed with whatever weapons were, presumably, on him before being whisked away. By starting in media res, the film shows the audience that it is interested in the same sort of lean, no nonsense storytelling of the first film. When Royce comes across several others who have been stranded along with him, including a Yakuza decked out in a full business suit, a wisecracking criminal, a female sniper, and, strangely enough, an ordinary primary care physician, among others, each character is drawn with nothing more than a quick sketch. We don't need to know these guy's backgrounds, we merely need to know that the series is going back to the mercenaries versus predators formula that has served it well in the past.    In one of the better scenes of the film, the stranded mercs come to a clearing to discover a series of strange moons and planets midway between waxing and waning in an alien sky. This is the twist that the predator sequels have been looking for ever since Predator 2 way back in 1990. By pushing the film outside of our solar system, the filmmakers have opened up a whole set of possibilities. The castaways not only discover that they are stranded on a game preserve (a twist that more closely allies the film with the short story, \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\"), but also suggests that there is some sort of civil war brewing between the predators. While many of these ideas are not fully capitalized on, they still show a sense of imagination and an earnest attempt to show the audience something we haven't seen in a predator film before. I especially enjoyed the showdown between the katana wielding Yakuza and a predator, a scene that begs the question, did the predators ever visit feudal Japan? Perhaps this can be explored in the sequel, Predatorses.    But even as the film attempts to show us something new, there is also a back to basics mentality in Predators. The events of the first film are even recounted by the sniper, Isabelle, who explains how Dutch managed to defeat a predator. This is a smart maneuver because it avoids unnecessary scenes in which the characters rediscover the strengths and weaknesses of the predators, finally catching up with the audience. It also tells us to ignore most of the sequels, suggesting that this is the true heir McTiernan's original, a connection the film highlights each time Alan Silvestri's original score swells. But Predators (plural) never quite matches the storytelling quality of Predator (singular). The tension between the castaways in Predators isn't used as well as the tension between Dillon and Dutch's team of mercenaries. The story itself seems somewhat episodic as the humans stumble along from one danger to the next, seemingly without a plan.    The biggest curiosity of the film, however, is perhaps the strange turn by Adrien `The Pianist' Brody. There is a certain amount of logic behind casting the wiry Brody in the role, since Danny Glover was also a step down from the vein popping biceps of Schwarzenegger. I'm pleased to say that Brody handles the role of action hero well. Not only has he trained for therole, but he manages to affect a gravel crusted voice that gives off enough of an I-don't-care attitude for us to believe that this Polish piano player is now a hardened killer. No, if there is any fault in the film it does not lie with Brody. It is the fact that the film, for all of its ideas, never fully comes together in order to create something greater than the sum of its parts. For many, this means there will be plenty of arguments about which is the true heir to the original film, Predator 2 or Predators.

B002VECM4A|3.0|I had high hopes for [[ASIN:B002VECM4A Precious: Based on the Novel \\"Push\\" by Sapphire]] after seeing the hype and awards it received. Indeed, I did think the acting was great, and appreciate the innovative use of camera technique. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the overall product.    Part of the problem is that the film simply piles a lot of depressing twists and turns without any variation or break. I don't want to sound hard-hearted here - I understand that some people unfortunately do find themselves in such depressing situations. However, even movies that focus on hardship usually have some variation in the amount of depression plot twists they throw at the audience. For example, some movies show a character's hardship, but then end with her triumphant redemption. Other movies chose to intersperse moments of levity throughout the movie so viewers don't become dulled to the character's pain. I think [[ASIN:B000N6U0E2 The Pursuit of Happyness (Widescreen Edition)]] does this beautifully (I almost did cry for that one). This is CRUCIAL because in order for audiences to sympathize with a character, they have to like that character first.    [[ASIN:B002VECM4A Precious]] does none of that. Instead, it feels like the director is trying desperately to make his audience tear up by throwing one misery after another, without ever giving us a reason to like Precious herself. While I felt sorry for her plight, she also comes across as devoid of common sense and rude. She calls her child with Down Syndrome \\"mongoloid\\" (a racist term for Asians). Her greatest joy seems to be stealing a bucket of fried chicken. Meanwhile I never found any inner strength or inspiration in her that made me really want to root for her. Without that emotional anchor, I found myself becoming overwhelmed and ultimately desensitized to what she was experiencing. By the end of [[ASIN:B002VECM4A Precious: Based on the Novel \\"Push\\" by Sapphire]], rather than cry, I felt like, \\"oh, so that's howthe directors managed to make her life more miserable...\\"    There were a few times when the movie tries to lighten up, but these fail. For example, the scenes when she fantasizes about becoming a star were just way too long, and the style jarred too much with the rest of the film. Precious playing with her newborn baby in the pool and dunking him in the water was (I think) intended to be a moment of joy, but all I could help thinking was that this girl should not be allowed to keep the baby! Likewise, the ending doesn't really inspire much hope or warmth. In fact, the denouement happened so quickly I almost missed it.    I really wish I could give this film a higher rating. It does educate viewers about the very real problems that some young women struggle with every day. Also, again, the acting is superb. Unfortunately, rather than be drawn in emotionally, I felt detached from Precious. It's too bad, because just a few changes could have made this work so well.
0439023513|2.0|I was very disappointed in Mockingjay, I have to say. I thought the narrative arc of the book was sloppy. The ending felt rushed, unfinished and degraded the integrity of the whole trilogy. I applaud Collins effort to create complexity in a story of rebellion against a totalitarian state, but the passive narrative ending made short shrift of the personal relationships and the cynicism of the politics was uninspiring. I can't think that this trilogy will inspire anyone to get involved in making our world a better place. If Collins wanted to simply tell the story of a complex rebellion with a mixed result, better to do it in one book. I had the same let down as I did by the crummy ending to the Twilight series. Who's going to pick these books up when they hear that the ending is disappointing?

She proves to have a lot of intelligence, courage, and compassion.

B001MEJY8W|5.0|Anna and Lucie are friends on a mission. They are out to face and destroy the demons from Lucie's childhood of abduction and unbelievable trauma. Unfortunately, the pair have embarked on a journey into terror, torture, and utter despair. MARTYRS appears to be straight-forward enough, especially in its first half. Then, secrets are unveiled that plunge everything into a hideous nightmare of hopelessness and agony! Sound like entertainment? Well, if this description gets you excited, you might want to seek professional help! MARTYRS is a non-stop descent that simply never lets up. Once the aperture begins closing, it chokes out all light. Still, the underlying idea is ingenious. The title comes into play in a way that astounded me. Is MARTYRS disturbing? Certainly, but in a different sense than say, CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST or PHILOSOPHY OF A KNIFE. Though there is definitely violence and gore, it is not gratuitous, and actually needs to be included (Although, the graphic nature of KNIFE is also necessary). The truly unsettling things in MARTYRS are mostly psychological / pathological. I was drawn into this story far deeper than I am by most horror films. Anna and Lucie do not deserve their fates, nor is there any trace of a Hollywood resolution. This is horror in its extremity. A masterpiece in blood...

It's easy to read and straight to the point. Spencer goes into great detail about the tools and digital sculpting. In all the years I've bought stuff online I don't think I have ever written a review, this time I had to. This book is on my desk at all times, for technical reference and artistic inspiration. If you are looking for a great cg sculpting/modeling book then right now this is the only choice. Aside from taking an actual ZBrush character sculpting class in person, I see nothing that comes even close to this book. Spencer even covers human anatomy in detail just as any artist should know and explains in detail what tool would be best for which part of the sculpting process and how to use it. During my time in college I've meet life drawing instructors that covered anatomy less than this guy.

All around you see all this stuff about 'Men's brains' and 'Women's brains', and it always struck me as odd that a sex that has, for example, written so much brilliant literature should be deemed semi-autistic, etc etc. So here comes this brilliantly researched book (just take a look at the pages and pages of notes at the end - this author knows her onions backwards and forwards and sideways) - and she points out how shoddy it all is.   And she's funny!   No one will ever again have to sit through a dinner party with some parent going on about how 'I thought that too, but you only have to LOOK at my two children to see there are innate differences... bleh bleh'. She unpicks it all and shows how social pressures are so important and the brain differences that are so often claimed are, essentially, neurotosh, aka neurosexism. I think I shall carry a copy round with me.
B003EYVXYG|4.0|I had this pre-ordered on Amazon, but was thinking I should cancel due to all the negative reviews. I'm glad I didn't listen to the reviews. :)    The movie Survival of the Dead marks the first for a lot of things for Romero.    First is that it's the first time there is a direct sequel. The original trilogy and the two previous films were all related, but unrelated in term of the character connections minus a few references here and there in the films. In this version, Romero use the troops from his previous movie Diary of the Dead, who if I remember correctly, entered the main character's camper half way in the movie. It was an insignificant part of the movie Diary, but it was used as the foundation of characters in Survival.     The second thing is that this is the first time where Romero intentionally used comedy in his film. I'd say the originals had very few \\"outright\\" comical parts, but in the introduction before Survival, Romero comes on screen and explains that there are comedy in the film.    Overall I think the movie was great. The story of Survival is similar to the story of Day. There is an island with two leaders, one of which believe that all the walking dead should be put to the ground. The other believes that the dead should be kept, should be rehabilitated.     Overall the movie gets slightly ridiculous by the end. There is a part where they were using this \\"smart\\" zombie who rode a horse, and they believe that by eating another food source, it would prove that they can be trained to eat something besides human. I think Romero forgot that in the original Night, there was a zombie who ate bugs, so it's a bit of a delusion on the part of the survivors to think they can be trained to want something else. So I'm unsure exactly why Romero decided to go this approach, but my assumption is that he wanted to show that the characters in the movie just weren't thinking rationally and that since there is a on-going feud, the two sides are just taking the opposite approach just to disagree with one another.      As a fan of Romero's film, looking at his latest creation, apart from the original trilogy, I think Romero \\"missed\\" something here. Perhaps it's the comedy tone or whatever, but just something doesn't hit it right with the original. Perhaps it's a bit of nostalgia of the originals, or perhaps Romero lost touch with something, I just don't seem to think of Survival as anything that can compete with his original trilogy. I think he done the \\"smart\\" zombie idea a bit too much. As Captain Rhodes would have said, \\"They're DEAD!\\" I mean I think it's an interesting concept to think that maybe they're us inside that rotting exterior, but overall we just can't see them as that since they clearly want to eat anything living. Realistically, I guess one would look at it on a viral level, rather than a psychological level which seems to be the main theme in the current version of the film (understanding what they are, and trying to change their drive is a bit sort of like psychology, or maybe behavioral therapy for the dead).     Personally as a fan, I understand Romero's approach to trying to change the behavior and drive of the zombies, but Day of the Dead already proven that even going with the cognitive behavioral therapy approach, human nature is just too evil and greedy to do it properly. We get all that. Now it's time to move onto another theme besides behavioral or even the concept of a \\"smart\\" zombie. What we need is another theme that fans can go off one. We should go with the viral approach. Personally I think it would have been just awesome if Survival was about an island of researchers trying to work out a cure like in Day, but end up backfiring. That would have been great and no longer trying to make the audience buy into the whole \\"Let's train them, but let's show them that they can't be trained.\\" I recall Romero said anyone who died, and did not die of a brain injury, would rise back up. So with that in mind,it could present an interesting research potential for a movie.     Overall good movie, but hopefully next film Romero will try to do something drastically and not try to write the same exact story but differently. Overall for this film, it is good but just not good enough for me to consider it a part of Romero's legacy.
0439023513|4.0|As the fantasy genre goes, Ms. Collins is truly at the top of her game.  The Hunger Games books are packaged to teenagers, but I would wager that half of the people who read this series will be adults.  I daresay they will fare quite as well, critically, as Harry Potter and infinitely better than the Twilight series (which is as it should be).    First the good.  As the other two were, the story is a page turner from first to last.  Collins knows how to weave a tale with the sort of brilliance that people will be talking about for years to come. It is no mean feat to create an entirely new world full of horrors, chaos and the unfamiliar without tripping accidentally into the esoteric.      Another wise move by Collins was to keep from falling into the trap of making Katniss too infallible.  The 17 year old blunders her way through Mockingjay as she did through the other two -- with unflinching bravery punctuated by a bad temper and questionable decision-making.      Peeta's handling, though heart-wrenching, is also brilliantly done.  Collins allows bits of the old Peeta to come through even after his torture at the hands of the Capitol.    Now for the bad.  Mockingjay was significantly more violent and graphic even than the other 2 books in the series. In fact, it seems that the book was written more to adults than kids.  I wouldn't let anyone under the age of 14 near this.    Furthermore, the crucial scene between President Snow and Katniss is quite unfulfilling.  Granted, Ms. Collins does this in the name of plot twist, but one feels that she could have added the twist without compromising that dynamic.    Last, I couldn't help but be disappointed in the handling of Gale.  He gets more and more unlikable as the series progresses.  By the time Mockingjay gets to its final chapters, I'm asking myself what Katniss ever saw in him in the first place.    But for these drawbacks, I'd have given the book a 5 star rating...and I still give the series a 5 and suspect it will be in the hands of teenagers for many years to come.
B0001FR3IQ|1.0|...and even more clich&eacute;s.  I have a problem with clich&eacute;s, especially when they can't seem to back themselves up with anything substantial as a form of recompense.  Instead, films like `Gothika' lather on the `been there done that' with a heavy hand, sprinkling in generically effective `thrills' in an attempt to say \\"see, we made you jump in your seat\\".  Sadly, those thrills die off pretty quickly when the plot holes become more and more evident and the straight-laced direction seems to take the viewer on a path leading to predictability.  Think `The Sixth Sense' (that ending was such a rip-off) meets `What Lies Beneath' with an R rating and some gore.  Oh yeah, and far inferior performances (what WAS Penelope Cruz doing?) and a script that didn't understand itself.  You will spot the bad guy the minute you see him, even if the ridiculous plot tries to convince you it's someone else, and you will roll your eyes at the films conclusion, which overworks the CGI to deliver an action sequence that takes you outside the creepy tones they were trying to create here.  Insane asylums are typically scary places, but you really have to work your environment to create lasting chills.  `Gothika' seems content with just dropping us in a scenario that seems scary and then leaving us to get bored with it.  Thankfully the overrated Halle Berry manages to attack the flow of the film with a performance that reads surprising sincerity.  It's just a shame that sincerity is misplaced.

You can really place the story in any country where you find corruption at the highest levels. Great mystery underlying the story of Salander. And I am looking forward to the conclusion in the third book.

B0009X7664|5.0|Althought the book by Harper Lee gives more detail, this is one of the greatest Gregory Peck movies of all time. A very well done piece of cinematic tribute to an awesome story.
B003A4IFGY|5.0|TP remains a great story teller, razor-sharp lyrics with the usual sprinkling of irony. What makes this a great CD is the band - everyone is perfect and there is a real sense of enthusiasm in this session. Each song is a gem of composition and hangs together seemingly effortlessly, quite a feat as apparently a lot of the takes were done on the first shot with no (or very little) post-producton over dubbing; real pros at work! Superb sound, especially for guitars with vintage Gibsons featured. Mike Campbell's guitar work just gets better with time. Great lyrical player who blends in seamlessly with each song, not some hot-shot shredder out to prove what a fretboard genius he is - but the guy is a genius. Each song has a different groove, but they all have a great sense of forward momentum that will bring a smile to your face. In this era of Tweener tunes, computer generated rave up \\"music\\" and other assorted garbage it's a real treat to hear a band that totally has its act together and is having a great time performing.
0307454541|4.0|Amazing book. Once I got about 50 pages in I didnt want to put it down. There are really 3 stories woven together so it works well. The characters are interesting and well developed. There were still some questions I was left with at the end. A couple that relate to the main mystery line in this novel I have a feeling will never be answered. But the ones regarding Salander I am hoping will come out in one of the next 2 books. Sadly this series was outlined at like 10 books but only 3 were finished before the author died. So I am hoping we are left hanging too much with the third when it is released in May.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Awesome Wireless Headset! The G930 is great for gaming and it produces surprisingly good stereo sound too for listening to music.    I have not tried to use the G buttons yet.    Pros:   1. Wireless range is very good  2. Sound quality: 2.0 and 7.1 surround is very good  3. Battery life is good  4. Volume control on the headset is a good touch  5. Completely over the ear design is comfortable for long hours of gaming    Cons: Maybe the price, but then again, you get what you pay for. So I really have no complaints at all.    I recommend this headset to anyone who plays online games or anyone who wants outstanding wireless headphones for their PC.
1416562605|5.0|It was hard to put down...I'm glad I took it with me on my vacation.  It should open your eyes to a whole new world, a different perspective of India and its daily life.  Very well written and certainly deserving of the Man Booker Prize.
0439023513|5.0|SPOILER ALERT:  I agree that Ms. Collins took Mockingjay in a direction I didn't see coming. But I love a book that is unpredictable. This story was never about the typical YA love triangle that has become so popular these days and so trite.  This story is about the realities of war, the costs, the soldiers used up and discarded and left to recover from the ravages and damages of their wounds and choices. This was about the gray area of the agendas of power hungry leaders and who they are willing to sacrifice to achieve their goals.    This book wasn't about Katniss, the superhero either. She's ultimately broken as anyone would be after living through her hellish life. I came to love some of the other minor characters...but unfortunately most don't live to see the destruction of the Capitol. One complaint: I missed the old Peeta and I most definitely wanted more of him as he recovers. I want to know what happened to the pearl and where he was in the end during the siege and why he was burned. Although Collins was much too stingy with her words in the end, they were well-chosen and ultimately satisfying. I am so grateful for the Epilogue.     At the end of \\"Lord of the Rings\\", after the destruction of the Ring and restoration of the Shire, Frodo still suffers from the pains inflicted during his quest. At one point Frodo tells Sam, \\"I am wounded, wounded; it will never really heal\\". I thought alot about Frodo and Sam as well as Ender Wiggins while reading MJ. Neither Ender nor Frodo were ever able to return to a normal life. Katniss, though a victor, is still a casualty, but one that finds love and hope with another victim. This story was more \\"real\\" than \\"not real\\". And sad. Terribly sad. It will linger with me for along time.
B003EYVXUK|1.0|10/23/2010 Update;  I've read every critics review I could find on this film.  I bought into the hype and went to see it. I stand by my original assesment based on viewing only the trailer. There is no conceivable way (and I will argue this point to the ends of the Earth, try me) that Reeves' film is better than the original--as some critics claim. He lifted the color palette, the tone, a number of key shots, dialogue, etc. from the original film. That doesn't constitute a better film. It's like plagiarizing an essay. You take an original, obscure source. You take all of it's original ideas and principles and you twist them around and reorganize and restructure them to fit your purpose. People may marvel at your \\"fresh take on the original source material\\", but it's certainly no masterpiece. Case in point: The pool scene. Easily the most memorable scene from the original film. Reeves sets the whole thing up quite well, but when it comes to the execution he falls short. Throwing about 50 more gallons of blood in that pool and making the one kid cross diagonally behind Owen and having a decapitated head fall down in front of his face came off hokey and lame. And that's just my point: if the point was stand off and away from the original film, why is so much blatantly ripped off from it? Why do you have essentially the same shot in the pool scene only changed by about a 45 degree camera angle? It seems he didn't make his own adaptation of the novel, but rather tweaked a screenplay to mediocre results. Don't get me started on the acting by the two leads. I had high hopes for Chole Moretz--what a disappointment! There was not one moment of her performance when I did not know she was just regurgitating a memorized script. And Kodi Smit-Mcphee, OH. MY. GOD! Could his performance have been any worse?  It was like they dubbed his voice with the english dubbing from the original movie. No emotion, no depth, no nothing. If you do not know what I mean.  Watch just a few minutesof the original movie with english dubbing and you will see.    This remake is just another example of why the original is a masterpiece, and a genuine work of art that deserves ALL of the   praise it has gotten. Especially praise of the two lead actors--  Lina Leandersson and Kåre Hedebrant. The film's director, Tomas Alfredson, took his time in   finding the two young actors (incredibly, their first time on screen) and   their performances are magnificent, heart-wrenching and totally believable!    I give the remake zero stars.  Yes, that is correct, ZERO! \\"What an idiot. You gave it one star\\".  Only because Amazon FORCES me to chose from 1-5 stars. But thanks for your comments.    My original review is below:    Let me be the first to give this remake zero stars.  I just saw the first trailer which was recently released.  From WHAT THEY SHOW in the trailer, it is identical to the Five Star original--\\"Lat den ratte komma in\\" (Let the Right One In)  Do your self a favor, check out the reviews for the original and then watch it!  I am curious to see Chole Moretz as Eli or whatever the vampires name is in the remake.  Her role as Hit Girl in Kick Ass was superb.  Unfortunately, Kodi Smit-Mcphee is playing Oskar.  My first exposure to Kodi was his role in \\"The Road\\".  I was not impressed.  In fact it was some of the worst acting I've ever seen. Too bad, there must have been someone else they could have chosen.  Oh well, I'll probably see the remake at some point just to satisfy my curiosity. However, I am determined to despise it.
055380684X|5.0|Daniel has written a book that not only is a fun read, but documents his thesis well. The entire premise of the book, how we develop talent is fascinating and he has an innate ability to speak directly to the reader. His writing style is conversational, fun, and irreverent. The way we develop talent can be applied to all areas of one's life. Great read.
1416589473|5.0|If you play Guild Wars, or want to play Guild Wars 2, (and like storyline/lore) this book is a must read. Sets up the setting for GW2, while letting you get to know more about the new races introduced at the end of GW.
1439153663|5.0|I am a chronic reader of novels - everything from Jane Austin, to The Last of the Mohicans, to James Patterson, and on and on. This was one of the best books I have read in a long time. The character development was outstanding. I felt I knew these people personally and I cared so deeply that I often had to put the book down when things got difficult. They even visited my dreams! It is a stark look at a reality we mostly want to forget. I highly recommend this book.
B002ZG9846|5.0|It is great to watch a film that it is entertaining in an innovative way. I bought this movie not really knowing what the plot was about. I heard many people praising it that is why I wanted to check it out. It seems that this film is part of a post-modern movement in filmmaking.<br /><br />As a mom, I am still shocked at how much I loved this film, although the violence was a bit much for me at times (though necessary for the plot).  The acting is above and beyond, with Nicolage Cage bringing his A game.  The little girl, Chloe Moretz, who plays \\"Hit Girl\\" is off the charts, ridiculously adorable and a bad ass, a strange combination for a child that works incredibly well here.  She's a sceen stealer and I don't want to give any plot points away, but I was often terrified she was going to hurt herself.  The lead, \\"Kick-Ass,\\" Aaron Johnson is believable and no matter how far fetched the movie dives, you're wanting him to win.<br /><br />Although the film follows a Hollywood agenda it does it in an innovative cool way. The visuals of the film keep you watching it. Boundaries are pushed throughout the film.  The directing and editing is flawless (for me!) and it's one that I will definately watch again as I'm sure there is much I missed the first time around.<br /><br />If you want to watch a fun film Kick Ass is perfect for you. The Blu-Ray version is great because it also comes with a DVD and a digital copy. This is NOT for kids.  I loved that such a wild and crazy film could have so much heart.  We've all felt like \\"Kick-Ass\\" at one point or another.
B002N8A14M|4.0|This is really good for a couple of reasons....The acrylic clear case is sturdy and protects the nano quite well.  After running with a rain drop or two....I wasn't really concerned. It kept my 1322 songs shuffling well along.  The previous reviewer did have a point about the bottom section, so far as to slightly push off the plug hole  so the headphones plug cannot fit in all the way. My Earbuds fit fine. The Armband velcro stays snug through  a sweaty run too...with good construction.
B003NEVVSU|5.0|I just bought this recording for, I think, the fourth time. The remastered CD sounds superb, and the bonus DVD of the best and classic lineup of this band is absolutely priceless. This lineup of Renaissance is one of my all-time favorite bands - a pity they are no longer together. But c'est la vie in the world of rock bands.
B001U3Y5XE|4.0|Keeping it short and sweet, this set has been great.  My 5 year old isn't really interested in the playing the game, but she LOVES the idea of looking at a picture and then having to recreate it in lego.  Of course you don't need to the game to do this, you could just pick up a magazine and point to a picture lol, but the cards have hundreds of things on them.  For sure at her age she needs help with them so it's a great way to buddy system.  Usually she has me make the main item and then she makes whatever supplements we'd need.  like if we pull a house out of the stack she'll make a stove and microwave while i build the house.  Kind of nice extension of the game really, pulling things she's not familiar with and letting her figure out some things that object might be complimentary to.    Definitely there's not enough pieces to make anything grand but honestly the point of the game is to be quick and small but accurate enough that a teammate could guess the object.  So in the context of the actual game the number of pieces are probably ok, but for the variation we've been playing i needed to order one of the generic brick supplements.    This is really a great toy though.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|I love the packaging for the series and am happy that this isn't a limited or special edition pack. This set is for true Lost fans, it comes with a little light that you can shine on a few things in the package and hidden symbols appear.  I thought it was a unique and fun packaging and it went beyond my expectations.     I felt the packaging for the product was great and secure. The DVDs are in booklets which are a bit awkward since they slide into the packaging instead of popping out, but they're definitely secure and are inside of the large box it comes in (as can be seen in the picture)  That large brick looking thing comes in its own box, so definitely safe and secure for shipping.  On the bonus disc that can be found for season 6, they have extra footage that occurs after the season finale (how much time passed after the finale is the question though) in which Ben pops up predominantly but Hurley will be there also to make an offer to someone :)
0316017922|4.0|I was very intrigued by the first half of the book.  Great ideas regarding the influence birthday cutoffs have on our future development path.  However, the second half seemed to wander and I didn't feel there was a connection to the concepts presented in the first half.    I would recommend this book, but it didn't quite live up to the hype for me.      Rami
0061801313|5.0|I am 16 and I never read books. After seeing the pretty little liars show I became obsessed and wanted to read the books. I just finished the fourth book and I bought them a month ago.

B002ZG9968|1.0|\\"The Back-Up Plan\\"  is a good reason to read a book, play Scrabble, wash your hair, or go jogging.  It's a total waste of time.  Supposedly a romantic comedy, it's predictable, with a leading lady (Jennifer Lopez) who has no sense of comic timing, a bland leading man (Alex O'Loughlin), a contrived plot, and as much on-screen chemistry as a pair of cardboard paper towel rolls.      Zoe (Lopez) is a single New Yorker who hasn't yet met Mr. Right, but she's itching to have a baby.  So she gets herself artificially inseminated only to meet Stan (O'Loughlin), an organic cheese maker, the same day.  Zoe keeps her pregnancy a secret but makes Stan's life miserable because she's paranoid he'll leave her.  You know the rest.  He finds out.  He gets upset.  They part.  They reunite and live happily ever after.        There is absolutely no wit or intelligence within miles of this picture.  Lopez looks beautiful, as always, but it takes more than a curvy body to make a movie.  Bonus extras include an interview with Jennifer Lopez and \\"a bouncing bundle of hilarious deleted scenes,\\" as stated on the DVD case.  Yawn.

B003L7DK74|3.0|\\"Flight of the Conchords\\" combines the offbeat humor of \\"This Is Spinal Tap\\" with the colorful characters of \\"The Office\\" to come up with some very funny shows.  The dialogue often involves extended conversations that get weirder and more surreal as they go on -- not exactly the speedy repartee of Abbott & Costello's \\"Who's On First?\\" but a comedy blend comprised of a pinch of Jerry Seinfeld, a helping of Larry David, a few sprinkles of vaudeville, and several measures of Monty Python.      Bonus extras are plentiful and include a mini-documentary featuring Bret and Jermaine at their droll, deadpan best; \\"Dave's Pawn Shop\\" mock TV ads; snippets from meetings with the inept manager and his associate Greg; deleted scenes; and outtakes.

Circle The Drain - Good message about a drug abuser boyfriend who has lost his way. The production works half of the time but the song itself isn't as catchy as it should be. But the lyrics are decent. I'd give it a 3.75. PLUS<br /><br />7. The One That Got Away - This one is OKAY. I'm not really feeling it all that much although I thought I would. It's just talking about a high school crush that turned into a boyfriend but eventually slipped out of Katy's grasp. OKAY<br /><br />8. E.T. - Certain parts of this song are OKAY. Like the chorus. But I don't like the beat really. OKAY<br /><br />9. Who Am I Living For - Has meaning but I dunno about this song. OKAY<br /><br />10. Pearl - These songs with meaning in them don't seem to be as strong as her first efforts from [[ASIN:B0017ZB8M6 One of the Boys]] like 'Thinking Of You' and 'Lost'. The former song had a catchiness to it with great lyrics and the latter had great production. OKAY<br /><br />11. Hummingbird Heartbeat - Not as strong as 'Teenage Dream' or 'Mannequin' (which is my favorite Katy Perry song) but has a small rock  edge which was a nice change of pace. Also, expected more songs to be like this. 3.75. PLUS*<br /><br />12. Not Like The Movies - A different approach to the album. A piano ballad about a relationship that didn't make Katy feel whole so she waits until she finds a guy who gives her spark. PLUS*<br /><br />Honestly, this album needs a little more balance. It's all dance, very little rock and had many weaker songs towards the middle. Sometimes little substance too which her first album had more of.

7885142450|5.0|Best deal for Evangelion 2.22 until FUNimation finishes an English dubbed version (they JUST got the rights to 2.22 a few weeks ago, I believe. Probably shouldn't expect it until next year).     On my order: The package came the earliest predicted date of arrival.    The fact that it comes in the Eco packaging makes it even better, as the cost for the product and shipping are minimal.    DVD quality is perfect, and the special features are something that's been keeping me busy for the past few days: deleted scenes and the \\"2.02\\" making-of montage, showing how almost every scene was animated from the storyboard and beyond.    Of course, the official English subtitles are a blessing (no more fan subs). A few grammatical errors are present, but they only involve tenses, are are very easy to ignore if you're used to reading subtitles quickly. Listening to the Cantonese dubbing is also fun, just because I don't hear Chinese dubs of things all that often.    Overall, I give my prayers and good wishes to those who published and sold this copy of Evangelion 2.22. I don't think I could go another WEEK without seeing this film in its entirety ^_^

1594488843|4.0|I love books that give me `aha' moments. This book was one.  I've read a lot about the new generations and how managing them is different.  Part of me thought that these people don't want to work hard or put in their time and they want instant gratification.<br /><br />Now I'm starting to get it.  Daniel Pink explains that the very nature of work has changed from routine tasks to knowledge-based work.  The carrot and stick way of motivating worked okay for routine work, but it can actually be de-motivating for knowledge-based work.<br /><br />To be successful in today's word, you need to engagement and mastery. Another way of looking at this is being in the `flow.'  The challenge is how to motivate employees for this.<br /><br />A particularly effective method is allowing employees to spend a set amount of time each week working on personal interest projects.  The key is that they have to product something at the end, e.g. a prototype, a new process, etc.<br /><br />Daniel gives some interesting examples of successful companies doing just this.  Google lets employees spend 20% of their time on their own projects.  This is how Gmail and Google news were created.  So it works.<br /><br />Humans need a higher purpose for their life and if a company can capture this, they'll have productive employees.
0439023513|5.0|Amazing, only sad it took so long for the last book to come out.  Once I got it I couldn't put it down.  It steps right inot the plot, leaving no time for review, so I feel sorry for anyone who just picked it up without reading the previous two or maybe forgot a lot about what already happened.  So it took me awhile to remember some points in the previous stories.  Never the less Collins has trapped me in this world and I wasn't ready to leave.  highly recommended for teen and above readers.

0439023491|5.0|My Summary (SPOILER FOR 1st BOOK!): After surviving the Hunger Games, Katniss and Peeta both try to live their lives as normally as they can. Only problem is that everyone is supposed to believe they're in love, some Districts are starting to unsettle and rebel against the Capital, and it all just might be Katniss's fault.<br /><br />Katniss struggles with her feelings before she's off for the victory tour, unable to truly love Peeta, but things with Gale aren't going well either. Yet, she has more important things to worry about, like just what does President Snow plan to do if she fails to help smother the unrest in the districts?<br /><br />With twists and turns that will leave you breathless, Catching Fire is more shocking than a bolt of lightning.<br /><br />Review: Catching Fire definitely lives up to it's predecessor.<br /><br />With a slow-moving beginning, we find Katniss and Peeta both living in ease after surviving the Hunger Games. Yet, Katniss isn't happy. She's got a lot to deal with in this story. Everyone, and I mean everyone, is expecting something from her, and she just doesn't know if she has what they want and what it takes. The stakes, the risks, and consequences are so much higher in Catching Fire.<br /><br />What I noticed the most was how Collins managed to make me really care about each character. I was on the edge of my seat, literally worrying about some of them, and whether or not they would be okay. I could connect better with them this time around.<br /><br />The pacing does pick up, and once it does, it's a non-stop thrill to read. I still cannot believe where this story went, I'm still stunned even months after reading it. I dare you to read Catching Fire, and to put it down halfway through (because it really just isn't possible without curiosity getting the better of you).<br /><br />Highlights: The twists! The turns! The \\"Oh my gosh, did that really just happen\\" moments! Collins far exceeded my expectations of this story, and it's very obvious that she really does think about everything and plots it smartly.<br /><br />Lowlights: The beginning fails to really get going, as I said earlier. It was slow to spark my attention. Yet, I think the halfway point through the ending really made up for it.ery obvious that she really does think about everything and plots it smartly.<br /><br />Lowlights: The beginning fails to really get going, as I said earlier.

0596806027|5.0|Mark Pilgram has done a decent job of presenting HTML5's new attributes. His historical views may be boring to some, however they are of benefit to neophyte developers. His myriad of printed references, and URLs alone make it worth the price.
B003QCCS36|4.0|This album is a refreshing breath back to Trouble, Ray's first CD, because it's just the right mix of melody and harmony, supported by Ray's lyrics. His voice sounds great on this album, and the song listing is really clever. It's a little bit of blues, folk, alternative country, and jazz, all on one CD, without sounding disjointed. The songs show Ray's range as both a singer and songwriter. I'm hoping his future projects allow him to keep growing, as an artist. This is a great CD and any fan of Ray LaMontagne should own it.

0007144369|5.0|I should write another review for Edgar Allan Poe sometime (I frequently refer to both Poe and Wilde as \\"The Man\\")...but first, Oscar Wilde's anthology.<br /><br />Wow, I've probably still more than half of this collection to get through, though I've read \\"De Profundis\\" (Mr. Wilde's 80-page letter to Bosie, written while he was in prison) several times. Over, and over, from beginning to end, and for some reason, it gets better and better with each read.<br /><br />As Oscar Wilde states himself (is there a more brilliant wit to quote?): \\"If one cannot enjoy reading a book over and over again, there is no use in reading it at all.\\"<br /><br />I've read some of the poems, as well as \\"The Canterville Ghost\\" and \\"The Portrait of Dorian Gray\\"...I look forward to re-reading those, and discovering the gems I've missed so far!
B003EV6DBM|5.0|I just have to say I am astounded at the 1-star reviews here. And some of them didn't even watch the entire series! Don't listen to them. Doctor Who is better than ever.    I've been a fan since I was a kid back in the 80's when I saw Tom Baker as the doctor on PBS. Tom will always be my favorite doctor, but Smith's portrayal in Series 5 has completely won me over. It's so refreshing to watch him on screen. He reminds me of Troughton with a little bit of Davison/McCoy thrown in. He doesn't overdo it, he is very subtle, and that is totally refreshing. Especially after the overly emotional Tennant, who by the way was still excellent in the role.    The show is heading in a different direction, different but the same. I for one welcome the changes as all true fans should. Doctor Who is all about change. If you can't accept that just stick with Series 1-4.    The Eleventh Hour was by far the best Series opener since the shows return in 2005. For those that say that Series 5 has no replay value I couldn't disagree more. I have watched that first episode 3 times now since it first aired and still laugh at many of the scenes. And as is evident on Youtube, I am certain that I am not the only one that has tried fish custard! (It's good by the way)    The only clunker this Series had was The Victory of the Daleks, and I put that down purely to direction. The rest of the Series was golden, especially the Weeping Angels two parter and the jaw dropping finale. Fezzes are cool indeed!    In short, Series 5 is just really good science fiction. I'm excited to see what happens next!    If you are a fan show your support and pick this up! I know I will. And for goodness sake write your own review and give this the 5 stars that it deserves! Don't let the naysayers bring the rating down, most of them didn't even give the new series a chance.
B002ZG999U|5.0|Needed a box of Kleenex when the movie credits at the end were running! First off, Tears of Joy because I was beyond having been totally entertained! I think the people sitting next were kind'a disgusted with me because I kept bursting out laughing every time a bad guy got his! Stallone is back! Keep directing movies like this! AND where in creation can I get THAT Shotgun? REI? Cabellas? DAM!!! LOL!!! Now WHEN is the Sequel!? Some (of course) dum ass movie critic complained that all the movie was was just a bunch of 50 yr old guys running around creating Havoc with the Calif Govenor in a cameo.....honestly i like arnold, but this movie could've done without him in it------What happens when you take the Class A Action Actors and put them together---------I understand Stallone will make a sequel-------can't wait!! Now the Kleenex, lastly, tears of Sorrow, because the movie ended in a high note and I (sniff) will have to wait for the sequel!  LOL!! Have FUN with this one, this one I'm definitely owning!!
0439023513|4.0|***SPOILERS*** I REPEAT...***SPOILERS***  (I'm writing this intro to my review after I wrote the actual review)  I did enjoy the majority of this book. Just a warning however, that probably after you read this review, you will feel like I hated it. And that is just because once I got writing, I had to vent about all the things that I felt could have been executed better. But I repeat...overall, I liked the book, and it had it's redeeming factors, I'm just slightly frustrated that it didn't end better. And I don't mean it was supposed to end the way I wanted, I just would have liked to have been satisfied with the ending. Anyway, see what I mean? Once I start it's hard to stop. On to the review...    ***ONCE AGAIN. SPOILERS***     1. Negative: I felt that there was too much copping out when things were just about to get good. On several occasions I found myself slightly annoyed that I was missing out on what seemed like important events because Katniss was either knocked out or drugged. Then Katniss would resurface, and all we would get was a quick little synopsis from Haymitch or Boggs on what happened while she was out.  I know that Collins likes to leave some things to the readers imagination, which is one of the things I like about her writing style. But I felt that it happened way too often in this book, and that rather than trying to let us figure out what was happening, she was trying to save time and space by skipping a first-hand account of the event, and then giving a recap in a paragraph or two. The most annoying of these situations, of course, was at the end of the book.    2. Positive: There were several unexpected twists in the book. For example, Peeta getting rescued and turning out to be hijacked. Despite my being a hopeless romantic, and becoming physically ill at the loss of Peeta's love for Katniss, I enjoyed this twist because I enjoy unpredictability, which leads to a negative. The unpredictable ENDING of the book. An unpredictable ending would have been fine, if it would have been more satisfying, however, this ending was NOT satisfying. More about that later.    3. Negative: As mentioned above, I enjoyed the twist with Peeta's hijacking experience. But I feel like the recovery and the clean up of the situation was handled very poorly. As a reader of the  Hunger Games I grew to love Peeta because of his adoration for Katniss. However, in his time of confusion, I lost some of that love I had for him because his personality had completely changed. No time was spent on helping the reader to grow to love him again. For the hopeless romantics reading this series, myself included, the lack of Peeta/Katniss moments was extremely disappointing, and they were so necessary for the redemption of Peeta's character. Never have I hated a line so much as, \\"Peeta and I [grew] back together.\\" We needed to witness them growing back together. Obviously, pages spent solely on this purpose would have been somewhat tedious, but I think they should have been intertwined with Katniss's recovery and a more in depth description of what happened to Panem and its people after the war. That being another disappointment of the book.     4. Positive: Collins's strengths. Imagery. Character development. Action sequences (when they're present) The ability to keep the pages turning at an unremarkable pace. The ability to scare the crap out of me and horrify me with the gore. Yes. This is a good thing.    5. Negative: The treatment of Gale's character. There was plenty of Katniss/Gale time, for those readers who were Gale fans. Despite being a Peeta fan, I liked Gale as well. He and Katniss had a special relationship. But to me it felt like the situations Gale was put in demeaned his character. Mainly the ones involving Katniss. They hardly had any happy moments together. Mockingjay seemed to negate Gale and Katniss's relationship and made me question Katniss's difficulty over choosing between Peeta and Gale. It especially bothered me thatif it weren't for a minor statement about Gale living in District 2, we wouldn't have known what happened to him, and Katniss's lack of caring seemed utterly ridiculous.    6. Negative: THE ENDING. I know it sounds like I hated this book, or at least it's about to, but honestly, I absolutely LOVED this book. I was about to declare it my favorite, right up there with the first one. Then I read chapters 25 through 27, and all was lost. Even as I approached the end of the book, and the remaining pages began to dwindle, I became skeptical that all loose ends would receive tying, but the knowledge that it was Suzanne Collins's story and that she would want to give it a just ending, gave me the hope to keep reading. Unfortunately my faith in Collins was slightly misplaced. Simply stated, the ending was too rushed. Now for my not so simple statement.     We have spent the entire book, the entire series actually, waiting for the Capitol to be defeated, and more specifically to see Katniss go in and take out Snow. And neither of these events were given justice. Once again Collins copped out on us by knocking out Katniss via an explosion so that we miss the entire first-hand account of the defeat and surrender of the Capitol. What should have been an event spanning numerous chapters, was summed up in a couple of sentences. We also didn't get to witness any of the action with Peeta, or Gale, or Haymitch, during the surrender. Our emotional ties to these characters, and especially to Katniss, would have made these non-existent chapters real page turners, and where the action could have been pure perfection, it was instead non-existent. It was the epitome of anti-climatic. And although it would have been nice to witness the action, it's not even the the fact that we missed the final fall of the Capitol but more the fact that Katniss missed it, that was so disappointing. When countless numbers of people we care about die; Rue, Cinna, Finnick, Prim, District 12; and then the one person we truly feel has the right to avenge their deaths doesn't get to, it's very unsatisfying. On top of that, the whole situation defeated the purpose of Katniss's character, and honestly made her appear to be, for lack of a better word, wussy. So instead of what could have been an amazing attack on Snow, we get to witness the pointless death of Prim. But even this event could have been justified. Katniss had already started to lose herself at this point in the book, and Prim's death could have served to bring her back and given her that final push to kill Snow. Instead it sends her into a never ending state of depression, once and for all putting an end to the character we fell in love with at the beginning of the series. The perfect example of this is reflected in Katniss agreeing to another Hunger Games, which really bothered me.  Whether she was already planning on killing Coin or not, she never would have said yes. It would have completely reversed everything she had been working for. And if at this point she was already planning on killing Coin, what was the point in saying yes to another games, because either way, another hunger games was never going to happen. Another note on this situation, the death of Coin needed more explanation. Coin's assassination. The trial. The trip back to 12. The recovery of Panem. Peeta's return. Gale's departure. Katniss's recovery. Mrs. Everdeen. The rebuilding of 12. Peeta and Katniss's relationship. All of these things and more, still needed to be addressed after the infiltration of the Capitol, and three chapters simply was not enough to do it.    I guess the point I'm trying to make is that the ending of the book seemed to negate the entire purpose of the other two books and the first 24 chapters of the third. Obviously the first two books were mainly about the Hunger Games, but there was always that knowledge that Katniss and her gang were eventually going to have to defeat the Capitol and end the Hunger Games, so the fact that we don't get to witness Katniss accomplishing that, totally defeats the purpose of her character. The other main aspect of the book that kept readers interested was Peeta and Katniss's relationship. This too fails to deliver, in that we hardly get to see them interact with each other at all, and when they do interact, it totally negates everything you loved about their relationship in the first two books, and then there is nothing to redeem their relationship in the end. The two main plot points, the defeat of the Capitol for those who cared about the politics of the book, and Peeta and Katniss's relationship for those who were more involved in the romance of the book, were both sore letdowns, thus nullifying the point of the first two books. Both of these issues, however, could have been resolved if more time was offered on the ending. To spend two books, and twenty-four chapters of the third book, leading up to the collapse of the Capitol, and then not even witnessing its collapse, and then expecting to be able to tie up all the lose ends, and rehabilitate all the broken relationships within three chapters, is where this book failed tremendously. It almost seems like Collins got behind on her deadline and had to end what could have been another ten chapters (which fans would have read eagerly) within less than half the pages. Why spend so much time perfecting a story, only to write a sloppy ending?     Obviously if you've read the first two books, you have to read the third. Mockingjay won't disappoint in the levels of suspense, character development, and surprise.  But perhaps when you get to the end of chapter 24, stop reading, and imagine that Katniss storms into the mansion and shoots an arrow right through Snow's heart. I realize these are just my opinions, and obviously I don't know everything, and maybe some of my solutions to these issues are too formulaic, but hey, I'm not a writer, which maybe completely discredits this review. All I know is that if I was writing a story about characters I cared so much about, I would want them to receive their due-justice, and I would want my readers to at least feel satisfaction at how the story ended. And NEVER would I want my final installment to make the first two books I wrote seem entirely pointless. Like I said, I'm not a writer, but as a reader and as a fan of the books, I was let down. I realize everyone has their opinions, and it's impossible to make everyone happy, but Mockingjay left me so unsatisfied and more importantly, disappointed. I know I've used those words a lot, but I don't know how else to phrase my feelings after finishing this book. Never, in my entire life, have I read a book that left me feeling the way this one did, and this spawns from the love I have for the first two books. Its characters. Its story. To have anticipated the ending of a story for so long and then to have said ending handed over to you in such a sloppy manner is nothing more than frustrating.    Maybe Collins is happy with how it turned out. Maybe she wanted her readers to come away with a more realistic war survival experience, which I respect. Maybe the whole point was to realize the power one person, one symbol, can have in strengthening the people. I honestly don't know. The Capitol was taken down, but what does that even matter if the main character doesn't really learn anything, or grow from it, or even worse completely loses herself? Whatever Suzanne Collins was thinking when she wrote this ending, I don't think she anticipated the chance that it could possibly ruin the first two books for some of us. Personally, I enjoy reading the books that I love numerous times, and my only hope is that I can continue to read The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, despite knowing how it ends. I'm sure I'll find it within in me to do so, as I'm sure many of the other fans will, but I suppose that's because I have an imagination that will hopefully allow me to disregard this failure of an ending. The only thing I'm not sure I'll be able to escape it the overwhelming sense of disappointment...
0307271862|2.0|While I much prefer Nesbo and Nesser, I've read of few of Mankell's books from the Wallander series and enjoyed them for the most part.  I really looked forward to this book but was really disappointed.  The Chinese sections are rather tedious and long-winded and the story seems really contrived, i.e. our heroine just happens to have a friend going to Bejing, the homeland of the mysterious stranger she suspects has slaughtered the inhabitants of a tiny village.  Convenient, no?  Most unsatisfying is the ending, which seems rather abrupt.  And the motivation for this horrendous crime is never fully explored or explained.  It's as though the author said \\"2 1/2 inches is thick enough, I'll end it there.\\"
B000XA5K48|1.0|This is hands down one of the worst films I've ever seen. The acting was 3rd rate, the scripting was even worse. This looks like someone threw a budget on a middle school creative writing project.
0385504225|5.0|This book came quickly and made an excellent gift. It was also a great deal.
0439023513|5.0|This is a book i have been anticipating for a long time. after reading catching fire i was stuck on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen. none of my thoughts brought me to where it ended up. this is, before anything else, a book about war and the cruelties with which war is fought. the book begins with peeta's capture and katniss's introduction into life as a refugee of district 13. her home, along with the entire district has been destroyed by the capitol. this is were the revolution begins.     in this heartbreaking and often sad story you see what people will do to gain power, or to keep it. lines get blurred between whats right and wrong and who is a villian. the book is a wonderful and very real end to a great series and i know that the characters that i came to know will be with me in other books i read and when i hear about wars being fought. the story is masterfully told and a joy to read even when the story turns sad. i am happy with the ending and looking back it really was the only way if could have happened. anything else would have been an insult. if you liked the hunger games and catching fire this is a must read that will shake your to your core and leave you breathless and satisfied at the end. i know i will recommend this trilogy in its entirety for many many years to come.     May the odds be ever in your favor!
1423113381|3.0|The series follow up to PERCY JACKSON.  Told from the perspectives of a sister and brother with a lot of witty humor or attempts at witty humor.  It's a thick book with a lot of twists and turns but perhaps too many to the point where it seems to drag at the end.  WHEN READ: July to August 2010; MY GRADE: B minus (B minus to B if you are into Egyptian History/Mythology).
0439023513|5.0|There really aren't words to describe this series except it's brilliant. Mockingjay is a beautiful ending to The Hunger Games trilogy. It is thought-provoking, violent, sad and yet it has beautiful moments as well. The ending is perfect with no unrealistic \\"happily ever after\\" stuff that wouldn't have fit with the series. Without giving too much away I'd almost like to see what happens next to the two people who we are introduced to in the epilogue. I can't say much else without spoiling the book but if you liked Hunger Games and Catching Fire I think you will be satisfied with this book! I don't know how Suzanne Collins can top this series, I loved it!
1582701709|5.0|Rhonda Byrne's book is excellent and inspiring. I've read the book 3 times from front to back and used her suggestions to realize my true potential for joy, wealth and health. It's so easy to get lost in everyday mundane things, to take what we have for granted and lose sight of what makes us happy or even that we deserve to be happy. The Secret reminds me everyday to be thankful for what I have and low and behold I am receiving more everyday to be thankful for. This book has helped me so much I started buying it for my loved ones to read and have. I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever had a bad day that spiraled downward. This book will teach you how to turn your bad days into good days and your good days into great days. Thank you Rhonda for your vision!
0393327655|5.0|No matter how you slice it, the answer to the question \\"does God exist?\\" can only be answered by faith.<br /><br />That means that any answer, whether it augurs for a particular religion or even -- as Harris argues in this book -- no religion at all still remains merely a faith affirmation.<br /><br />While Harris argues mightily against abuses of religion, none of his arguments per se actually operates as an indictment of religion itself.<br /><br />Here's why:<br /><br />1) When Harris says that those who abuse religion make his case for its elimination he is perhaps on his weakest ground.<br /><br />Sure, terrorists, suicide bombers and their ilk -- who purportedly do their evil deeds at the behest of some perception of God -- are definately not religion's poster children. But the same could be said of abusive husbands and crooked politicians. While abusive husbands certainly undermine the currency of marriage, they still nonetheless do not make the case for the elimination of marriage itself. In a similar vien, crooked politicians to be sure threaten the viability of our political institutions but they don't make the case for the elimination of those selfsame institutions.<br /><br />In other words, if the existence of any institution could be argued for based on the idea that people from time to time abuse it, then I would daresay no human institutions would survive.<br /><br />2) Where Harris says that people who believe in God are wrong simply because their beliefs are rooted in a faith system not subject to empirical re-evaluation, he makes an interesting but ultimately irrelevant point.<br /><br />Sure, if one is to be Christian or Moslem or maybe even any other religion that has ever existed, one no doubt does accepting for all time and ever again the unique \\"truth\\" of their belief. But the same can be said of many other human attitudes. In this regard, I find it most interesting that the vast majority of people share not only their religious attitudes, but political and class affiliations with those of their parents. Viewed from an outsider's perspective, it's almost as if having been indoctrinated as children, people do their utmost to avoid further serious thought on these issues. (And interestingly enough, where ostensible changes in faith affirmation are made, the changes made are usually mild, viz: Catholicism to Lutheranism and the like.)<br /><br />My point here isn't that it wouldn't be nice if people were genuinely more willing to seriously reconsider their attitudes on such matters. Rather, I believe that the criticism propounded by Harris again unfairly suggests too draconian a solution to the alleged \\"problem\\" at hand, namely: people's unwillingness to respect other religious viewpoints. (Would that this could apply to politcial views as well!)<br /><br />If Harris is saying that religous adherence should be regarded as criminal where it requires one to do violence to others or otherwise strip others of their rights, he will find me in fast agreement. If, however, he is suggesting that only by throwing out the baby with the bathwater (getting rid of religion itself) then I think he's wrong by over reaching.<br /><br />3) When Harris fails to give serious credence to the good religion has done, I think he errs.<br /><br />In this regard, Harris is both dismisive and abusive towards those who would point to the great kindnesses performed in the name of religion or those who did them. Prior to modern times, he would say, religious people did a lot of good stuff but back then everyone was religious anyway. Two problems emerge here:<br /><br />The first is that religious people are still doing good and important stuff today and the second is that since the emergence of our species we're talking about like two thousand generations of humans. Are we seriously to sweep all their progresses under the same dismissive blanket? For me, the answer is clearly not.<br /><br />4) When Harris xenophobically picks on Moslems, he's hitting below the belt.<br /><br />The likes of Robert Spencer aside, Islam is NOT religion of intollerance or hate. Uncited in his book is the constitution of Medina, authored by Muhammed himself requiring Moslems to respect the Jews living in their midst not to mention countless hadith (or sayings or Muhammed) and lines from Qur'an which testify to the value of human life and peace among peoples. (In this regard, the Qur'an specifically preaches respect to what it refers to \\"as peoples of the book\\" therein refered to as Jews, Christians and Sabians...the last being perhaps a catch all phrase.)<br /><br />Also, as conceded by even Harris, it cradled the candle of human inquiry while the rest of the planet was living in the night of the dark ages. Even today, Moslem Americans are eagerly and peacefully taking their place along with the rest of us. In the mid east, Egypt and Jordan have already made peace with Israel to be sure to be followed by others.<br /><br />Sure, we could say that we'd like to see Moslem countries adopting this policy or having that political system but to say that there's something about Islam itself that makes people particularly intollerant or hateful is just unfair and wrong.<br /><br />Also, it's xenophobic too. Trying to engender anti Islamic feeling this close to 9 11 is just like similar behavior conducted against the Japanese after 12-7-41 (when Pearl Harbor was attacked by the Japanese starting American invovlement in World War II).<br /><br />5) When Harris picks on Christianity he's being unfair.<br /><br />As Harris correctly points out, the Bible does have its less than perfect moments (where it seems to preach death to homosexuals and others who don't believe for example). However, what he fails to observe that when the Bible's most incendiary passages were written, they were actually an improvement over other practices then in place. One example of this is the so called Moloch sacrifice where worshippers of Moloch would actually incinerate their children as an offering. (Interestingly enough this activity took place at Gehenna now rendered as Hell, yet another fiery destination, albeit for those more deserving of such a post death punishment.)<br /><br />The point is that the Bible pointedly disavowed this conduct and in so doing sided with the forces of history that would later abolish slavery and support the expansion of women's rights. To be sure, a lot theologians were dragged kicking and screaming along the way but significantly -- and as conceded by Harris himself -- they were made passengers to other theologians who read their Bibles to support freedom and rights for women.<br /><br />To be sure, certain passages in the Bible are less than progressive but as a whole the Bible is a unique document telling as admittedly oftentimes more about the people who wrote than how we should or indeed actually do lead our lives. And to be fair, in its early history and even among the visionary today it still serves as an inspiration for change.<br /><br />6) And finally Harris doesn't explain how -- if religion is so bad -- how the 20th centuries two greatest killers were both atheists.<br /><br />Yep. It's sad but true. More than Hitler, either Joseph Stalin or Mao Tse Tung alone caused more death individually. That's not to exonerate Hitler (who did remain a Catholic in good standing until his suicide in 1945) but rather to underscore an important point.<br /><br />When it comes to being either a homicidal murderer or just a doer of evil deeds, religion is no impediment. To be sure, it can and oftentimes has been the espoused basis of the wrongdoing but to suggest that one's propensity to violence correlates only with their religious beliefs is...well...just ridiculous.<br /><br />All these points being made, I do think this in an important book for the issues that it raises. From Neitczhe forward, it's been intellectually cool to press the whole God question, intoning on the one hand the various inconsistencies in religion while using the other hand to point dismissively at those who would beleive.<br /><br />But those good, decent law abiding people who choose to believe are within their rights...their right to follow the faith of their forebears, to have a relationship with God consistent with their faith systems and finally to be let alone as long as they're not bothering anyone...least of all, those among us who would claim to know \\"the right answer\\" or more repugnantly deign to impose it on someone else.ld actually incinerate their children as an offering.

B002VPE1WK|4.0|This camera bag is very similar in quality and function to the Canon 200EG but cost $10 less.  It is comfortable on your back; build quality is sturdy and holds tons of photographic gears: at least 2 bodies + a few lenses.    The only problem I have with this bag is that it holds your tripod to the side rather than having it hang off the bottom of the bag.  If you carry a tripod with it, it makes one side of your bag much heavier than the other.  The imbalance can be uncomfortable at times.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|I have followed lost from season one.  I think it is a very special show, and this is a great set.  The set does have it's shortcomings, which many others have stated.  But none of them really bother me.  The quality of the set, the picture quality on blu-ray, and the extras are all top notch in my opinion.  Worth getting for a lost enthusiast.<br /><br />I know many people hated the end of season 6.  I thought it was properly done.  I can see people hating it, and I respect that.  It cracks me up how many people are arguing on these reviews over it.<br /><br />For anyone who has not watched the show, it is a one of a kind experience in my opinion.  Season 2 & 3 were absolutely great television.  Like I said, I enjoyed season 6.  I enjoyed every season.  It really kept me thinking throughout the series and kept me guessing.  Not all answers you want will be answered, but the show is called Lost, and I am fine with that.<br /><br />Now, let me leave some space for Earnest to tell you how bad season 6 was:
055380684X|4.0|I had this book referred to me coupled with some pretty lofty laudatory praise.  A sea parting event for the reader.  That, it wasn't (for me)...but it is a fine book that largely restates established rules for deep learning towards outperformance capabilities to arise.  It also provides some fine examples for each of the key themes the author is attempting to communicate.  Coyle is an established and fine writer, so the text flows well.  In sum, I found this book useful and likely to be very powerful for a reader who has not previously been exposed to general issues of training and deep learning for outperformance results.

0307474712|5.0|This is a most unique and touching love story and friend story.      I hate it when reviewers give you the entire plot (and often ruin the reading experience for you) so I won't give you a lengthy synopsis (you can read the Amazon version online).      All I will say is that whether you're a romantic or a pragmatist, this book will make you laugh, make you fall in love with the characters, and make you think about them long after you have finished their story.      I know that it's currently being made into a movie, so my advice is to hurry up and read this book before the film comes out and screws it up for everyone.
0446563048|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It is extremely well written in a sort of conversational tone, that keeps it interesting.      I read a lot of business books, and this one was a fun read.  Tony Hsieh is quite an interesting character.  He's experienced outstanding successes throughout his life so far, but seems quite unaffected by it all, as he comes across as being very down to earth.  Who wouldn't want to work at a place that he was running?

It is already available locally at Wal-Mart, Best Buy, etc. You can tell a couple ways other than having to watch it and seeing the superior video compared to the original that came about a year ago. There should either be a yellow UPC code or if you look in the bottom right above the Parmaount symbol on the case there should be nothing listed. On the old copy it will say 2 disc set.
0439023513|4.0|Okay, so I'm a bit torn with this book.  As usual Collins delivers a story full of question, new friends, new betrayals, and is nearly impossible to put down. I loved it, I'll probably read it again and I recommend reading it! My only complaint is I feel the ending was rushed. We've spent three books coming to this end and to me it seemed somewhat anti-climactic. I feel for the all the past history between Gale and Katniss, their end simply being his saying something to the effect of \\"protecting your family is all I had going for me.\\"  Through the rest of the events we never see him again, and she just seems to accept that.  But then maybe the author did this on purpose? Katniss's life has been nothing but unstable with people leaving her and never coming back. I guess I can reconcile with this, but not the very end.<br /><br />Like I said, it felt entirely too rushed from the moment the silver parachutes were delivered to the children in the capital until the end. She could've made the book 100 more pages and it would've been fine and not been to dragged.  Collins does not show us the resolution, but merely tells us and suddenly Peeta and Katniss are together while through out the entire book they were so disjointed? And what of this somewhat conspiracy with President Coin? Did anyone else feel this was left to open and unfinished? I felt she should have touched more on the beginning of rebuilding their lives, her coming to terms with Peeta and Gale. But then again, maybe the author has her reasons. Maybe Katniss is too broken to give us anymore of an end than this?  What do you think?

B0034G4OU4|3.0|Whether or not \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" adequately represents the bestselling memoir of the same name ([[ASIN:0143118420 Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia]]) by author Liz Gilbert or not doesn't really matter.  Is it the fault of the filmmaker or the writer when the piece attempts to hit the side-of-the-barn of greater meaning and just barely skims the surface?<br /><br />\\"Eat, Pray, Love: the Phenomenon\\" recounts the year long journey of writer Liz Gilbert as she recovers from a messy divorce and an unfulfilling affair/relationship with a very 21st century self-absorbed pragmatism that appeals to both aging flower children and their \\"look-inward\\" progeny.  By combining worldly angst with the spiritual fascination of Eastern religions made fashionable by the Beatles in the 60s, Gilbert attempts to fill many different types of holes in the spirit of self-development simultaneously.  Although she succeeds somewhat in her book, director Ryan Murphy's film stalls when it fails to define itself within a particular genre.  Not that this ambiguity alone causes the film to fail--it ambles along prettily enough but unfortunately without enough thrust to make it stand out as a must-see event.<br /><br />Murphy/Gilbert's audience contains the wide subset of Oprah Winfrey watchers--those of the \\"live your dream\\" mantra that desire nothing more than to be able to make a lucrative career out of facilitating something they love.  Gilbert surely fits the bill here: her publisher financed her journey of discovery to three foreign countries where she could eat, pray and love her way to bigger pay check.<br /><br />Just what Gilbert is fleeing is up for grabs.  Her marriage to Billy Crudup doesn't work and neither does her affair with the young hottie actor (James Delicious Franco)--how sad is that? Neither of these man ask her to sacrifice her livelihood for them--Crudup is depicted as financially dependent on her and Franco blows her off emotionally when he realizes she is looking for him to save her.  As she wanders through the streets of Rome on the first leg of her trek, the audience senses her confusion--is the melancholy of her past preventing her from enjoying the pleasurable sensations of the present and the future?<br /><br />The juxtaposition of the \\"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\\" theme while in Italy--mucho plated food porn, the hum of Vespas and so many leather-clad Italians looking chic in skinny jeans--with the austere loneliness of the Augusteum in Rome to depict the change that the world and time has on one's inner identity marries the desire to splurge with a sad introspection that tries too hard--hinting at depression but not quite spelling it out.  Perhaps knowing that Gilbert actually battled depression with medication may help the audience better understand and relate to the confused emotional shifts through which the main character traverses.<br /><br />Murphy avoids this descent within the modern mindset for pharmacopia focusing instead for more than half of the film on Gilbert's sojourn at the Indian ashram.  Is he commenting on the fact that the status of being a spiritual seeker is just part of a look at the ersatz intelligentsia--those who emote often and within the boundaries of copious self-development/how-to realms where just living a good life with great companions isn't quite en vogue anymore?  Is he telling us that enlightenment has become the newest and trendiest goal?  In this sense, is it any wonder that the most predominant self-help guru of our time (Oprah Winfrey) has taken Gilbert under her lofty wings and is promoting not only the author's bestselling memoir but also the film and its star, Julia Roberts?  Is he helping to build an \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" franchise that advocates taking a long break from reality while attempting to peel away the layers that hide the inner self?<br /><br />Who knows?<br /><br />Gilbert's activities at the ashram are never really defined--her inner journey becomes trite and cutesy rather real and mind-boggling.  Whatever conclusion she reaches doesn't really reach the viewer--the audience waits for the \\"love\\" leg of the triangle because that is how a film as attractive as this with an attractive main character should end--with love.<br /><br />All this would be very cool if the film defined itself in more universal terms.  As a travelogue, the cinematography lovingly captures the Eternal City, the riotous humanity of Mumbai and the lush jungles of Bali with a glossy expertise that would do both National Geographic and Travel & Leisure proud.  As a romantic fantasy--girl is married to wrong guy, has affair with younger actor and than finds the hunkiest Brazilian ex-pat this side of Ipanema even after gorging herself with indulgent amounts of pizza, pasta and gelato--'EPL' might work.  However, the screenplay makes the mistake of dictating a New Age panacea for the ennui of modern life.  Whereas the average viewer expects a visual nirvana of charming faraway places, he/she is force-fed the not-so-palatable pill of Liz's self-absorption.  The result confuses; the storyline seems over-edited.  The overall messages gleaned from the experiences in the three places don't really flow with any real meaning because even though we are treated to some voiceover, we are not privy to the progression (if any) of Liz's without-rhyme or reason thought as we are in her equally poorly formatted book.  The bulk of the film's time is spent focusing on the routine of the ashram in Ganeshpuri, India where Liz fumbles through meditation, her early morning devotionals and some textbook feminism regarding the woman-unfriendly aspects of marriage.  Why she is there and what she hopes to gain other than to meet the guru of her ex-boyfriend is never fully mapped out.  She snaps with frustration at the gruff Richard from Texas (Richard Jenkins) also playing pilgrim at the hermitage and he speaks in zen to get her to the point where she can get between the sheets with Javier in an Indonesian hut.  Huh?  The amalgamation of the material world with that of the spiritual and the sensual covers too much ground in too little time while the formulaic ending of girl riding the waves with her new man trivializes the more somber issues introduced but never fully developed or rectified in the first two segments of the trek.<br /><br />As \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" can't figure out just exactly what its point is, the actors can't figure out how to play it. Choreographed with MTV-ish segments of Julia as Liz in different parts of the world, the audience strives to participate but cannot--Liz's pain is explained, but it is too nebulous--too deep and indulgent to fully understand.  All Julia Roberts can do is alternatively look sad or happy.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Watching Julia Roberts travel to three different world venues as she ponders the big question of life's meaning doesn't quite work in this film adaptation of Liz Gilbert's bestselling book \\"Eat, Pray, Love.\\"  A better venue for this soul trek would have been a National Geographic series where the points of scenery and dogma could have been better exemplified in documentary format.  Think [[ASIN:6302426227 Japan (4 tape set) [VHS]]] hosted by Jane Seymour.  More clearly introduced information would have fleshed out the personal stuff giving the audience more background and less muddle.

1592402038|4.0|Lynne Truss has written a book that must be placed in its own category: a best selling book on punctuation. It probably surprised even her. And it intimidates at least this reviewer, fearful of the numerous red marks he would receive, all due to a penchant for an extra clarifying comma or two, and a few other weaknesses. The title is a play on the changed meaning of the sentence if there is a comma after \\"eats,\\" and is accompanies by a panda, who would nominally be a cuddly grazing vegetarian but becomes a harden killer who takes a gun, and kills (all due to the lack of a comma.)<br /><br />Truss describes herself as a \\"stickler,\\" and says she was driven to write the book after viewing one too many mistakes with signage. Fair enough. And she has produced a thoughtful, amusing book on the need for greater precision in our written communication. The book is chock full of anecdotes, starting with just plain dumb to ambiguous errors, and then stresses the importance and evolution of punctuation. For example, the reader will learn that the novelist, Milan Kundera once fired a publisher who insisted on replacing a semicolon with a full stop (that's a period for Americans). Likewise, the Irish nationalist, Roger Casement was \\"hung by a comma.\\" Anton Chekhov once wrote a story entitled \\"The Exclamation Mark.\\"  And Aldus Manutius the Younger, in 1566, where a lot of this story all began, stated that the main object of punctuation was the clarification of syntax (surely a statement I will now routinely quote in defense of my \\"extra\\" commas.)  Ms. Truss (and hopefully the honorific is acceptable) manages entire chapters on the apostrophe, the comma and the dash.<br /><br />I figured she was just being a bit playful with her \\"over the top\\" mock outrage. She might actually be a pleasant dinner guest who would not exhibit the same fastidiousness in regards to wine selection or cutlery placement. But still, I did have a few problems. Principally, she is BRITISH! (Please, no scathing comments... some of my best friends are...) And while her book might work quite well in the UK, and assorted dominions, there is that \\"translation\\" problem for Americans that is not addressed, as well as others, and it goes beyond full stop, period. There must be at least 500 words that are spelled differently in the United Kingdom and the United States: color, colour, etc. The road to damnation would be paved with the supposed good intentions of impose one spelling standard or another. For better or worse, and it is generally the latter, at least the French have an Academie française, where language usage can be adjudicated... and new words invited, particularly in computer technology, so English words do not soil the sacred tongue. But English speakers have no such body, and Truss writes her book, sorta, as though one existed (herself?) I noticed that she gave only a passing nod to this problem when she said: \\"...that American usage has retained a lot of the formal niceties that we have dropped. They also often use a colon after \\"Dear Andrew\\", while on this side of the Atlantic we dither about whether even a comma looks a bit fussy.\\"<br /><br />Indeed, that sentence contains one of my favorite bugaboos about punctuation in an international setting. In British usage, the comma is outside the quotes; in American usage, the comma is inside the quotes. So, what is an honest \\"citizen of the world\\" to do? Be consistent, or give a nod to punctuation relativism!<br /><br />Enjoy the anecdotes, enjoy her tongue-in-cheek (hopefully) style, but an English speaking \\"citizen of the world\\" will find only paltry directions to \\"correct\\" behavior in this book. 4-stars for at least the wit, and yes, we should be at least clear and usually unambiguous in our written communications, and no doubt, Aldus Manutius the Younger would concur.some of my best friends are...)

B00386EZJU|5.0|This score has received a lot of attention and I was anxious to hear it. I have not seen the movie, so I can only base my comments on my listening experience from the CD. My first listen was a positive one, but I honestly wasn't blown away. With each multiple listen, however, I hear and discover different elements of the score that escaped me previously. It's not that the score is overly complex, but it's intricate and extremely interesting. I would say this is one of the most innovative music scores of late. Highly recommended!

B000E6EHGI|5.0|This was the first Dead album I listened to. It was back in '86 and from the first time I heard the glorious \\"roll away the dew\\" chorus on \\"Franklin's Tower\\" I knew I had made a new musical discovery that would have a major impact on my life.    Of all the Dead studio albums I think this one comes closest to capturing the groove and energy of the Dead in concert. The beautifully sublime \\"Crazy Fingers\\" is probably my favorite tune on the album but the material remains strong throughout. The bonus cuts feature 5 different instrumentals which also add to the album's similarity to a live performance.    \\"American Beauty\\" and \\"Workingman's Dead\\" remain my favorite. But this one is also at the very top tier of Dead studio work and should be a must purchase for any fan of the band.

0571212689|4.0|I liked this book, but I wish he had separated his autobiographical commentary from his thoughts and tips on animation.(The other artists he's encountered and worked with are fascinating, and it always seemed like there was more to tell, but it was like he suddenly remembered, \\"oh yeah, I'm writing a book on animation.\\") I would have gladly read an autobiography on Richard Williams. The cartoons of him with the other artists, especially the one where he gets yelled at for asking about listening to music while animating are classic!    So, yes a lot of great tips on animation, stuff I never imagined. I just wish it was pared out. I don't think it's as well organized as it could have been. Some things he mentioned he would do in the early part of the book, he never really got to. It could have been edited better.  I'm not getting down on him. I actually learned A LOT of things from him.  Just in a round-about way.
B003JR1USM|2.0|Pleasant second-rate (perhaps even third) all-females band - definitely not on the same level as \\"Nightwish\\" (in the days of Tarja), neither \\"Within Temptation\\", \\"Xandria\\", etc, etc...<br /> Sweet lollipop voice - Britney Spears-alike (or Hanna Montana), without real strength or power( [that one exceeds Indica in many ways[ASIN:B001BP2YOI Beast Within]), musical concept - when stripped of few tricks - is a commercial, bubblegum masquerading as metal (a females answer to spandex- or poodle-metal).  If \\"Space Girls\\" could have been alive, they might have ventured in the same direction. As I said, it's rather pleasant, sweet, but nothing more -suits for ice-cream parlour. Female-fronted metal it is not - apart from Tarja and Within Temptation, listen to [[ASIN:B003IY47JK Lucidity]], [[ASIN:B000W03RJE Faith]] for the starters. I would say it's another attempt to cash in on safe & secure recipe of all-females bands (which blossomed in the 60s to be revived decades later).<br />Most regretfully, composing remains the weakest point - for example, a more decent approach is shown by [[ASIN:B000R7I2D8 Lez Zeppelin (Dig)]]- if one is not able to squeeze out genuine melodies, why not to borrow from the peers?<br />The name remains the most powerful act of the band (from Cannabis indica).<br />Cool girls from Finland - Jonsu, Heini, Sirkku, Jenny, Laura - have been peddling this kind of music among teenagers & their families since 2001, and all 4 previous albums went gold or platinum - but in Finland (so far they fared better then, let's say, platinum album in Burkina Fasso or Kiribati).<br />This is their fifth and first English-language effort, patronized in many aspects and produced by Tuomas Holopainen of \\"Nightwish\\" - after Tarja quit, he acquired a taste of post-pubescent entertainers and drifted towards pop (same as [[ASIN:B003TE9BK4 Skintight (Limited Edition)]]- of ex-Theatre of Tragedy fame).<br />The band decided to break into the international market on top of the flood of merchandise - but instead of getting Indica suitcase Edition at EU 49,99, one can easily get 2-3 suberb CDs of far superior musicians.<br /><br />P.S. By the way, for anyone who is getting acquainted with female-fronted whatever, I would strongly recommended to listen to [[ASIN:B000025SJI Belladon]], [[ASIN:B0007GP656 Wytches & Vampyres: Best of]] - before commiting yourselft instead of getting Indica suitcase Edition at EU 49,99, one can easily get 2-3 suberb CDs of far superior musicians.

0316098337|5.0|This is truly one of the best books I've read this year. I hope to see it make a name for itself. Weeks after reading it, I still think about it.<br /><br />The story is about a college-aged woman who is abducted and made to live in a room by her captor for years on end. During this time, she has a child whose entire world is this room. She turns it into an entire world for him. The few objects in the room are personified (Chair, Bed, etc.) The mother is able to entertain the child in the most creative of ways (making a snake out of egg shells, etc.) The child lives for each week's \\"Sunday Treat\\" from the kidnapper. Even though the mother tells the child that nothing on television is real or that it's on another planet, he doesn't question where his Sunday Treats must come from. However, when the child is finally old enough to understand, she tells him the truth about everything and they plot their escape. But how could a child who has only ever seen the world of Room survive on the outside?<br /><br />This is a psychologically dense story that truly pulls you into another world within our world like very few novels can. I rarely read books more than once, bu this one is definitely a candidate for a re-read.

He is in Japan & either they don't know the music, don't understand the music, or just are not enthusiastic, but Joe put on an excellent show! He sings most of his previous hits, & some of his newer songs from his newest release (at that time). For a smooth R&B crooner like Joe, this is an excellent concert dvd...Sound is good & the picture is excellent...
B003ITZBW2|3.0|The aspects of the movie that made it worthy of three stars:       1. Jensen Ackles did a great job portraying the Red Hood as a vigilante using mobster tactics and Batman's training to control crime while concurrently working toward obtaining vengeance.       2. Bruce Greenwood lived up to my expectations.  He successfully gave the viewing audience a Batman capable of admitting he should not have made Jason Todd Robin.  Greenwood's voice was a perfect complement to Jensen's Red Hood, John DiMaggio's Joker and Isaacs' Ra's al Ghul.       3. Jason Isaacs gave me a complete understanding of Ra's al Ghul the character in such a short amount of time.       4. Kelly Hu's voice-over acting    The aspects of the movie that kept me from giving it four or five stars:       1. Wade Williams:  While Black Mask is a volatile villain, he is also a cunning crime boss that constantly keeps Batman on his toes.  I felt as if Williams overplayed the part throughout the movie.       2. John DiMaggio:  He was the best choice for the role of Joker given the script.  However, as a fan of Batman the Animated Series and Justice League, I always wanted to hear Mark Hamill deliver the type of gritty Joker dialogue given to DiMaggio.    I would recommend this movie for fans of Jason Todd or the Red Hood.

0688163173|5.0|Received just as described.  Really enjoying the book and can't wait to see the movie!
B0015AARJI|4.0|It's a PS3 remote and it vibrates when games tell it to, there's not much more to say. It's a bit expensive for a remote but it's either this or one of those cheap generic remotes.
B001S86J5S|4.0|I love this movie from so many angles.  I am a huge baseball fan and love deadpan humor, so, what's not to love.  The Ueck is in his prime in this one.  If you are a baseball fan who likes to sit back and enjoy a good chuckle this is a good way to spend some time.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Just have to say that I am a huge fan of the 'Alien' movies, and think that the price for this 6 disc set is very reasonable. Can't wait for Oct. 26th!
B001VZY4M8|4.0|I guess I'm really making an effort to listen to old music at this point. I liked Neil Young as a kid when my parents listened to him, so I thought I'd pick up what seems to be his most acclaimed album. And it's really good!    It's a pretty good mix between his style of rock and roll, usually accompanied by Crazy Horse, and some more individual, folksy numbers. Although I've always identified Young by his frequent harmonica playing, it didn't really stick out here, only appearing in one song, with the focus more on occasional piano and much more frequently, his guitar. A few of the songs have messages, which I associate with him just as much as anything musical, although some seem to be simple songs with no purpose other than to sound good. I've grown accustomed to his high pitched voice by this point, but even if you have some trouble with it, I think it would be hard not to like at least something from this album.    To me, the highlight of the proceedings is \\"Southern Man\\", a pretty hard rocker that jams along for five and a half minutes, and has a pretty searing anti-racism message to it against the south. Along with a song from his next album, it inspired the recording of \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\", which is a connection I wouldn't have expected. \\"Oh, Lonesome Me\\" is the only song on the album not written by Young himself, and has a really nice melancholy to it. \\"When You Dance I Can Really Love\\" is another stand out rock track, while the first two songs are more subdued, and another two favorites. \\"Cripple Creek Ferry\\" is the kind of song that would never be a single because it's too brief and singular, but is always welcome as an interesting way to begin an album, or make a transition, or as in this case, close things out. It's a nice cap to a record that I couldn't find much I didn't like in.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Everything about this movie is perfect. It's suspenseful and keeps you guessing until the very end. One of Christopher Nolan's best--if not THE best--films. I highly recommend it.
B0034G4OYU|4.0|In May of 2009, the crew of Space Shuttle \\"Atlantis\\" oversaw the fifth and final service mission of the Hubble Space Telescope, known to NASA as STS-125 or Hubble Space Telescope Servicing Mission 4. The mission called for delicate repairs and state-of-the-art upgrades, including the instillation of the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (to study the formation and evolution of galaxies) and the Wide Field Camera 3 (which captures images on the visible spectrum). The crew also had to replace one of the telescope's three Fine Guidance Sensors, six gyroscopes, and two battery unit modules. The mission was a success, completed in less than thirteen days. Because of the crew's efforts, Hubble will continue to operate until at least 2014, when it's expected to be replaced by the James Webb Space Telescope.    IMAX's \\"Hubble 3D,\\" narrated by Leonardo DiCaprio, is in part a documentation of this mission, made possible due to the IMAX Space Team and the specially designed IMAX 3D camera. While hardly an exhaustive account - which is just as well, since it would mean having to endure confusing technobabble and a slew of acronyms known only to NASA personnel - we're shown some impressive spacewalk and repair footage, aided greatly by the ever-present backdrop of Earth. We also get some insightful, if brief, moments with the \\"Atlantis\\" crew, including a demonstration of how to dress for a spacewalk, a discussion of some of the tools they will be using, and an amusing look at what an astronaut can eat and how it's made possible. There's a general sense of enthusiasm amongst the seven astronauts, although that may have more to do with the camera crew than with the actual mission.    We don't get a detailed history of the Hubble itself. Its original 1990 launch, for example, and the subsequent three-year odyssey to repair its design flaw are mentioned in passing, drastically downplaying the time, money, and effort that was spent to get it working properly. You have to understand that this is by no means a cheap piece of machinery; its initial cost was estimated at around $400 million, and that figure has only increased with time. With so much invested in it, there was an understandable backlash when it was apparent that there was an error with the optical system, the returned images failing to achieve sharp focus. The cause of the problem was the telescope's primary mirror, which had been ground to the wrong shape - the edges were off measurement by 2,200 nanometers, and to give you some perspective, a single nanometer is about 1/100th the width of a human hair. The flaw was corrected in 1993 during Service Mission 1, known as STS-61, with the instillation of specially designed corrective optics.    Since then, Hubble has captured a number of remarkable images. Because of its orbit outside the distortion of Earth's atmosphere, there's virtually no background light, allowing for the sharpest quality pictures. Consider the Ultra Deep Field image, which captures a small section of space in the constellation Fornax and is composited from four months worth of data; it reveals a cluster of galaxies of all shapes, ages, and colors, and it remains to this day the deepest image of space ever captured, looking back approximately 13 billion years. The film takes data similar to this and transforms it into breathtaking computer generated flights through distant regions of space. One scene in particular takes us into the Orion Nebula, where a massive group of stars form in a crevice that spans 90 million light years. Given time, some of those stars may form solar systems very much like our own.    This is the second part of what \\"Hubble 3D\\" is: An awe-inspiring journey, a deeply thought-provoking foray into the great unknown. It has the power to make you think, to raise questions about ourselves, about where it all came from, about what it all means. It wisely avoids speculation; it merely presents the material as is, and your mind does the rest. The fact thatit's all presented in 3D only adds to the wonder. Plenty has been said about James Cameron's \\"Avatar\\" - and I've certainly contributed - but \\"Hubble 3D\\" is by far the best 3D film I've ever seen. Never have I felt so deeply immersed, so entirely a part of the world projected up on the screen. It reaches a level so rarely reached by the hordes of 3D movies released on conventionally sized screens.    If there is a weakness to \\"Hubble 3D,\\" it's that it doesn't spend enough time on its subject. It clocks in at a measly forty-five minutes - on television, that would amount to an hour-long special. I would have greatly appreciated an expansion of telescope's history, including who designed it, how it was funded, when it was built, how it affected popular culture, and so on. The images it has captured, after all, are the reason we can create such accurate computer generated maps of nebulas and galaxies. I don't believe we can truly appreciate the contributions the Hubble has made without first knowing what went into making them possible. Sure, any book or internet site can fill you in on the details, but if you're already at the theater, you might as well learn everything you need to know there.
B001USHRCK|5.0|As always Legos are the best toys ever invented, however this may be the first time I am concerned that several keys pieces appear to be be missing!
B002VECM6S|5.0|Well acted, well scripted, well directed--this movie pretty much has it all.  It's also a great reminder of the kind of differences in the lives of others that we can make as human beings.  Overall, one of the better films I've seen in a while.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I'm not sure if this is the best movie I've ever seen, but for the life of me I can't think of one better.  I'm not usually a watcher of Pixar stuff for some reason, indeed the last one I'd seen was the first Toy Story.  No good reason why that's so, I just never got around to them.  But something about the premise of Up grabbed me, so when I saw it in a used DVD bin, I snagged it.  Two watchings in two days later, and I ordered this particular Blu-Ray copy of it, after bragging about Up to anyone and everyone I came across.    What's great about it?  Where do I start?  First, there's the house made of balloons.  It makes for amazing cover art, and arouses curiousity.  Petty you think?  Not really, the eye likes what the eye likes, and that's not to be discounted.  The characters for another.  Carl Frederickson isn't some to good to be true hero or precocious kid, he's a crotchety old man who actually behaves like an old man.  Go figure eh?  He doesn't look much like voice talent Ed Asner, but Asner's voice is letter perfect for the performance.  His sidekick, Russell, voiced by Jordan Nagai, acts just like a little kid would act.  He's very observant at times, but naive and obtuse a lot of the time as well, just like a real life version of Russell would be.  The two of them make for a great team, even if Carl is a little slow to grasp that.  And that's what's terrific about the roles, neither of them know everything, or instantly figure out what to do.  They have to think, and the movie shows them thinking. Not a lot of movies have the patience, or the sense, to allow its characters to think.  But Up does.  The supporting characters, like Christopher Plummer's Charles Muntz, the dog Dug, and all the rest are excellently handled as well.      The highlight of the supporting characters, for me, was the young/old versions of Ellie Frederickson.  The young version is voiced by the director's daughter, and she has the right bit of spunk and adventure for the shy and callow Carl (they look to be about 8-10 years old in those scenes).  The adult version, who marries Carl, is done without a voice, and is part of the most touching montage I've ever seen on screen.  We watch 50 years of their lives in a few minutes, with no dialogue, yet it spoke volumes.  This is why the cliche \\"A picture is worth a thousand words\\" is so relevant even today.  I think I've watched it five or six times and I still tear up during it.    The computer artistry is what one expects from Pixar, even someone like me who isn't a habitual watcher of their films.  The balloon house, the airship, the dogs (don't laugh, they're a riot), all of it was done with amazing technical proficiency, and always adds to the story.    But it really comes back to Carl and Russell in the end.  I cared about them, what happened to them, and more importantly what they took out of those adventures.  I've not heard anything about an Up sequel, and there's nothing on its Wikipedia page, but I would love to see another adventure with the two of them in it.  Either way, Pixar has made a fan out of me for a long time, I hope they can keep it up.    Five stars
B001VPJYZK|5.0|Thank you for having this item, I live on Guam and we couldn't find this item here so my wife checked on amazon and what do you know she found it. So thanks again!
1423113381|5.0|I need to comment over my rating. I am a nonagenarian and am rating a book written for teen to young adult so I tried to discard over seventy years. If I rated it for my age group it would be three so I hope I dropped the years correctly. Anyhow the format is somewhat fair, the girl and boy take turns expressing their views of events.  This is where the young me and the true me differ, the action is fast and furious, page after page of conflict. As a youngster I would love it, as an oldster I need a break, I am huffing and panting after only a few chapters, I need a rest which I do not get. One person after another gets knocked for a loop. Chapter authors switch, they get a break, the reader does not.  New gods or warriors are introduced, the question of who possesses a body occurs, whom does the current author, or the author's sibling, trust? The parent, of course, the uncle maybe, the god or goddess cohabiting the author's body, maybe, but control is never surrendered. Towards the end the true enemy is revealed and all the fighting up to that point is shown to be fruitless and some sort of an armistice is worked out and a new result is sought. We now have to wait for it, how many books will that take? I have no idea, it could become a lifelong quest.
0439023513|5.0|I won't bother with summarizing the plot, I think enough people have done that already. I was so nervous to read this book. I didn't know if it would meet my expectations, at all. I was afraid that the ending would be a cop-out, and that it would the the fairy tale ending with no logic as to how everything managed to end so perfectly.     I don't have anything against happily ever afters. I prefer them most of the time. But not with this book, because of where the author had taken the story with the previous two books. I don't think I could have respected the work as a whole if Collins had gone in that direction. But there was the little part inside of me that wanted both, hoping that there would be a couple in the end and that it would be realistic. What surprised me so much, is that I got both of my wishes. Not the way I thought it would come about, but in the end -- it felt right even if it seemed so unfair.     This book was painful to read, but there was some laughter and some sweet moments -- like the wedding. And there were parts that had me bawling. And parts that had me angry. But the beauty of this book, is that I cared and was emotionally invested. Good writing does that. It made me feel for these characters, whoop with joy at their triumphs and cry buckets with their losses. And even days after finishing the book, I can't stop thinking about it, wanting to re-read certain parts. Thats a good sign of a good book, or I don't know what is.    I hope Ms. Collins continues to write, even if she takes us on adventures to new places.
B002VPE1XE|3.0|Originally, I did not like the main velcro flap on this case. It is a bit flimsy. But it works. I have gotten used to whipping out my camera at a moments notice to take a pic. No zipper to deal with. So I have a love/hate relationship with this product. the biggest problem is that my camera is a slim style and this case is to big for it. If you have one of the larger camera's it will undoubtedly fit better than my Casio. It is only 6 bucks so in that sense it's a good bargain but there is better cases to be had. If you have a slim style camera you should check out the Dolica SM-98305BK<br /><br />I received this product free of charge to try through the vine program.<br />Would I spend my own money on this? No
0978607651|2.0|Rating here is for the book quality, printing, and value, not content and design. The content is great and the book is nicely designed and has some good photos and useful information to help you understand Harper, it's just horribly reproduced here in a low quality binding.    I don't usually write reviews but felt compelled on this one because of the shock I felt when I examined this allegedly $200 book!     I was thinking of $pending the money on the big version (this one), so took a look at the local university library since I was kind of excited to see it.     Though it's a recent acquisition there and looks like it hadn't had much use and had never been checked out, the binding is already pulling away from the (cardboard, not cloth) binding. The binding looks more like one on those 'bargain' books made to be sold cheap in stripmalls than one on a $200 book - I would expect this book will tear from the cover at some point!     Also, the print quality is very disappointing for the asking price.    The first thing I noticed was fuzzy images on many pages where the offsets didn't line up (in the book printing rather than the original artwork or duplication). At first I thought it was maybe from the original art, but looking closer I saw a lot of misaligned halftoning on the page and other evidence of poor quality printing. Some of the art is obviously reproduced from pages of the Ford Times, presumably because that was all that was available, which is more understandable in a cheap magazine than an expensive art book.    Worse still, many of the images have very visible 'jpeg artifacts' - distortion from over-compressing the digital images at some point in the production and/or using lower than necessary scan/photo resolution (another problem with the modern over reliance on 'desktop publishing' methods for the production of books that used to be done with much greater care!)     The text on many prints, though they should be big enough to be readable in the size,are just blurs... This might be less noticeable if viewed from across the room, in dark light, while drunk - but this isn't how I like to enjoy folio-sized art books!    The colors are also rather dull in this printing, I suspect duller than the originals, and surely less spectacular than the few posters I've seen.        The pages showing the National Park posters, for one example of many, are just awful here - blurry with annoying 'digital' distortion that renders them almost ugly (if one didn't love the original art supposedly portrayed), at the very least vastly disappointing. The Glacier Bay one, which I know fairly well, is so dark, muddy, and blurry here that it's painful to look at.    So, a poor quality weak cardboard binding, poor printing, dull colors, digital compression artifacts, and low resolution images told me all I needed to know in about 5 minutes.     It's a shame (on the part of the publisher and in the memory of the artist) that they didn't go with a better printer (perhaps going with a Chinese printer as they did was cheaper, but it obviously resulted in a poor quality book) and produce something that would justify a $200 price tag (even at $100 this is overpriced due to the many quality issues). This is most certainly *not* a quality book in the tradition of expensive art books.    So I think I'll take a $35 chance on the smaller one. Another reviewer mentioned the colors look better in that one in part because of coated  paper vs. the matte used here.      I hope that they didn't use an even lower quality image for the smaller version, as printing at half the size of the large version may go far to hide the flaws so evident in the larger version (just like a 50k jpeg image may look good in a small website but awful fullscreen).  In fact, the text size, as well as the many flaws in the printing make this book look like it was prepared for a smaller print size and then for some reason printed twice the intended size.  It'd've been a much moreexciting volume in the large size if it were prepared and printed nicely, but I see no advantage in this format size over something half as big, unless the smaller one is even worse!      And I hope the binding in the smaller version is a lot better suited to holding the pages in the cover, as this large one is not.      At the very least I'd've only spent $35 and not 3 or 6 times that much to be disappointed!
B003J27WFW|5.0|I had to give my 2 cents on the extra's. I LOVE the live recording's with John Rutsey. It was great to see where they started from. Everyone knows that Neil is easily one of the best that has ever played but it was nice to see the beginnings. Without Rutsey they go nowhere. They would never of have had the opportunities when they needed them so I give John his props! The dinner extra was downright silly. What a bunch of goofs! I love that about them!

B000JBWWRY|4.0|It is easier to judge Walt Disney's 1953 animated adaptation of James Barrie's \\"Peter Pan\\" for what it is; rather than for what it is not. What the film gets right, it gets spectacularly right. Animation is, indeed, the best medium to capture the magical aspects of the story. The sequence where Peter Pan, Wendy, John, and Michael fly from London to Never-Land is stunning. It is almost immediately apparent why \\"Peter Pan\\" is one of the finest Disney films of the 1950's. The film gains much of its appeal from the excellent vocal performances of Bobby Driscoll (Peter Pan), Hans Conreid (Mr. Darling and Captain Hook), Kathryn Beaumount, (Wendy) and Bill Thompson (Mr. Smee). The story has plenty of action and adventure, and moves along at a brisk pace. The depiction of the Indians as caricatures instead of characters is painfully, politically incorrect. But one must remember the era in which this film was made. It would be decades before Cathy Rigby's stage revival of \\"Peter Pan\\" would correct this sticky situation. But, as the stage and animated films are completely different mediums, the point is moot.<br />  The Disney version of \\"Peter Pan\\" is an artistic triumph. It is often delightful, but it is only about fun and games in Never-Land. While Disney captured the magic and fantasy brilliantly, he never grasped the darker, psychologically complex aspects of the story. The Disney version captures Peter Pan  as the spirit of youth, joy, and freedom, but lacks the emotional depth of Barrie's original story. The great villain Captain Hook clearly represents the \\"adult, father figure\\" who must be destroyed because he's a threat to all the fun and games. There's no romantic tension between Peter Pan and Wendy. There is no acknowledgement of Peter's lonliness or the things he will never have. At the end of Barrie's play, Peter Pan returns to the nursery and discovers Wendy is now a grown-up adult. Disney completely ignored Barrie's ending, and all of its bittersweet implications.<br />  The DVD features an excellent audio commentary by the late Roy Disney, (Walt's nephew), film critic Leonard Maltin, several of the animators, Margaret Kerry (the model for the hot-tempered, jealous pixie Tinker Bell), Kathryn Beaumount-- and even some surprising comments from Walt Disney himself. The short featurette \\"The Making Of Peter Pan\\" and the longer documentary \\"The Peter Pan That Almost Was\\", are especially informative and entertaining.<br />  The brief life of Bobby Driscoll, more tragic than magic, is a sad footnote to \\"Peter Pan.\\" Driscoll, who received a special Academy Award for his role in  the suspense-thriller \\"The Window\\",  made immeasurable contributions to the success of Disney's \\"Song Of The South\\", \\"So Dear To My Heart\\", \\"Treasure Island\\" and \\"Peter Pan.\\" After his Disney contract was dropped (the same month, incidentally, that \\"Peter Pan\\" was released), Driscoll descended into drug addiction and spent some time in prison. Driscoll died in 1968, alone and peniless, at the age of 31. Of his movie career, Driscoll remarked, \\"I was carried on a satin pillow... and then dumped into the garbage.\\" Magic and happiness, it often seems, exist only in the movies.ons.<br />  The DVD features an excellent audio commentary by the late Roy Disney, (Walt's nephew), film critic Leonard Maltin, several of the animators, Margaret Kerry (the model for the hot-tempered, jealous pixie Tinker Bell), Kathryn Beaumount-- and even some surprising comments from Walt Disney himself.

1601252463|4.0|Its not the best rpg book I've seen lately,but its up there. It's got lots of useful information in it. I particularly like that a good part of the new feats in it are for level 10+. Also, I enjoy the inclusion of feats tailored to the barbarian, bard, monk and druid which were kind of missing in the Core book. I enjoy the core class customizing section. This lends to a thematic interpretation of the classes and adds a lot more variety without a lot of change. The six new classes are nice. Not sure they're all going to get used. In all its a great addition to the game. I'll use almost all of it and that means its not a waste of money.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|The first movie to talk about autism was Rain Man with Dustin Hoffman which deserved both Best Picture and Best Actor.  Now there is a movie of a true story of a woman with autism.  Claire Daines really really shines as Temple Grandin who is a front runner for an emmy and a golden globe win. This film did well with telling her story and briefly describing how talented she is.  I also liked both David Strathairn as the teacher who supported her and Julia Ormond as the mother.  They did a great supporting roles in playing two essential figures in Temple's life.  I hope both those talented actors get an emmy for their roles because I could not see acting better than than what I saw in this film.
0380789035|1.0|This book had an interesting premise, that never got off the ground. You never even learn the main characters name. He spends the first 3/4 of the book blundering along aimlessly following a guy named `Wednesday' he spends the last 1/4 of the book in what seems to me a justifiable goal of just getting the thing to end.<br /><br />I found it utterly boring and as compelling as toast. I finished it just on the hopes that some characters I didn't like would die.
0439023513|2.0|SPOILERS AHEAD!!         What. the. f***. Words can't begin to express my disappointment. I bought Mockingjay the first day it came out and I was preparing myself for a truly epic novel, one worthy of its predecessors. I loved The Hunger Games; it was fast-paced, thrilling, suspenseful. Catching Fire wasn't as good but it was still enjoyable (I was majorly impressed by the game arena). I wasn't let down by Catching Fire though; I figured it was just a transition novel, build-up to what would undoubtedly be a mindblowing, epic conclusion in Mockingjay.     Maybe I set my expectations too high. I do think Collins is a good writer; she definitely knows how to write and tell a story. But I feel like she lost her way in this book. Or maybe the only thing that made this series so great was the Hunger Games, and now that it's absent, there's nothing to drive the story.     The love triangle wasn't well played out. First of all, I'm getting a bit tired of reading about love triangles -- especially in novels where there's a much greater plot present. But I'll admit, I was on Team Gale throughout the series, because he was strong and resilient and resourceful and caring. There was this attractive manly quality about him and he was so in sync with Katniss, and hot to boot. But towards the end of this novel, I didn't give a flying fart about Katniss's love life and who she ended up with, because everything seemed like such a hopeless, depressing mess that there was no point. I also hated how she kept flip-flopping and toying with both Gale and Peeta (I've been bothered by this since CF). She should make up her mind about who she wants instead of leading them both on! Her fickleness is pretty inconsiderate to these 2 guys who she supposedly cares about. And if she can't decide (I can see why, they both have great qualities), then she should give herself some space/time to decide, and in the meantime, don't go kissing or showing romantic affection to either one!     She ended upwith Peeta, which would have been fine if it had been executed properly. But even in this aspect of her life, she didn't get to CHOOSE, which is basically the story of her life. She just ended up with Peeta because he was the only one who stuck around. At the end, I found myself wanting her to end up alone, of her OWN choice. Heck, instead of spiraling into bleak depression and continuing life as a puppet, I would have rather seen her die for a noble cause and for doing the right thing. That would have been a more satisfactory ending, and that's saying something because I normally HATE when characters die.     I didn't like that we didn't get to experience the action close-up. As the war unraveled, I felt like Katniss was always on the sidelines, only called in when other people commanded her to. We didn't get to see Katniss kicking butt against her enemies, we got to hear from other characters about events that occurred, or watch them on the TV. It is so mindnumbingly dull to be watching a character watching something, instead of experiencing the action with the character. Everything she did was for show, for a propo or campaign or whatever. It was all so .. fake. Here they are in the middle of a war, people are dying left and right, and all they care about is filming and getting good shots and angles and putting on a pretty face! It felt so staged and it was boring and infuriating to read. The only real action is towards the end when she and her team are going on the assassin mission to kill Snow, and even THAT was originally only for a propo (that went astray).     The last third of the book (the assassin mission) was gorey and bloody, which I didn't mind. It's war after all. But many characters' deaths were so rushed and pointless. Prim's death didn't have the impact that I'm sure Collins was aiming for; I didn't feel sad when she died, as she's barely in the story as it is, so I didn't get to know her well enough and connect with her beforehand. She was absentfor at least 100 pages before her death came out of nowhere, for God's sake, so her death felt like any stranger's death. (Although it seems her death kind of defeated the point of sparing her from the Hunger Games.) What DID kill me was Finnick's death. Finnick was one of the characters I loved most in this series, and call me petty, but I can't forgive Collins for killing him off after he'd been through so much and finally got to marry the love of his life. It wasn't even a death of purpose. He got eaten by mutts in a sewer, along with half their assassin team. It annoyed me so much because their deaths felt so UNNECESSARY, like they were just a way for Collins to emphasize that \\"this is a DEATHLY SERIOUS, VERY BLOODY BOOK!\\" It felt like she was just randomly and meaninglessly killing off supporting characters because she couldn't bear to part with her main ones. Deaths are fine when they're important to the plot, but this felt like death for the sake of death.     Okay, now on to the REAL disappointment of this book: Katniss herself. One of the reasons why I loved this series was because of Katniss. She was strong, resourceful, clever and cunning, she had an amazing survival instinct and she knew how to persevere. In Catching Fire, these qualities diminished; she was mainly a pawn, a puppet for others to use for their own objectives. But she still had some semblance of control and she was still Katniss. In Mockingjay, all these traits are scrapped and we get a Katniss-clone who is angsty and bitchy and whiny (wasn't Bella in Twilight bad enough?). Half the book, she's throwing herself pity parties in the closet (literally!). Sure, she definitely has reason to be sad and angry, and her life is full of hardships and tragedies. But I thought that the Katniss from the Hunger Games, the Katniss who had to keep her family alive since the age of 12, would be able to fight through and persevere. I guess I wanted a strong victor, a strong heroine, not a self-pitying victim who can't make her own decisions.     That's another thing that bothered me: throughout the whole book, she had no control over ANYTHING, not even her own life and actions. She was a empty, lifeless pawn, a zombie if you will, who didn't do anything that wasn't directed or commanded by other people. In this novel, I was expecting her to STEP UP, embrace her role as Mockingjay, use her power/influence to get involved in the rebellion, take control of her life, and make a difference in the outcome of her world. I was expecting to see her grow and change and I was excited for her metamorphosis. Instead, we get this weak girl who's shirking all responsibilities, addled on drugs half the time, and lashing out at people the other half. Not only did she not improve herself from the first book (she was kickass in the first book btw), she got WORSE, an empty shadow of her former self. At the beginning, I could understand her confusion, her pain, her reluctance to be the Mockingjay. It'd be weird if she DIDN'T feel this way, if she didn't have that time of indecision and unwillingness. But after, I expected her to be strong and work through it, to face her fears and obstacles and choose to do the right thing, to really fight for justice. The best things in life never come easy; anybody who's done anything has had to overcome obstacles to accomplish their goals. When she decided: \\"I must be the Mockingjay\\", my heart soared (cheesy but it did!) and I was rooting for her 100%. When I heard her inspirational words during the propos, the fire behind them, my heart soared because I thought Katniss was back. But as I kept reading, I realized .. even though she verbally accepted her role, her mind still wasn't in it and she wasn't in control of herself. She didn't grow and become stronger, that's what pisses me off.     The post-traumatic stress, the mental breakdowns, the self-pity, the self-loathing, the nearing of insanity .. all of these things are realistic, yes, but a bit tiresome and not very interesting to read when it's all the same and the narrator is drowning herself in it in the face of much greater things to the point where it detracts from the plot. These feelings shouldn't be the main focus throughout the ENTIRE novel. There has to be a turning point when she overcomes all of this and actively decides not to let these obstacles stand in her way. Now, many people will say her breakdown is more true to life, and it's what any normal 17-year-old girl would feel and go through. But, maybe I'm weird here, but for some stories, I don't WANT to read about the average, normal teenager. I want to read about someone who's a bit special, who's different, who displays traits (like courage, heart, perseverance) greater than the norm and accomplishes more than the \\"normal, average teen\\" even during the most difficult of times. Something that, when you close the book, makes you feel like \\"Wow, they're amazing. Inspirational. I want to be like that.\\" & to be honest, I didn't sign up to read a war documentary or some nonfiction account of how war affects its victims. I came in expecting a break from reality, a fantasy sci-fi young adult novel about a girl who becomes a hero.     In trying to be as realistic as possible, I think Collins chose a pessimistic extreme of \\"realism\\" to portray. There are perfectly human people in real life in real circumstances who are able to fight through obstacles and hardships and come out on top without relying on drugs and hiding in closets. They can find more constructive and positive ways to deal with their problems. Sure, it obviously affects them (they're not invincible) but they don't lose themselves the way Katniss does. Those are the kinds of inspirational stories I wanna read when it comes to these kinds of novels, not this \\"Diary of an Emo Puppet.\\"     This book was also REALLY anti-climactic. Whenever Collins finally gave us an exciting scene, as soon as it got intense, Katniss would get knocked out inthe midst of things and we'd wake up to her in the hospital being treated. (MAJOR COP-OUT, in my opinion.) Then, of course, comes the inevitable centuries (that's what it felt like) of us hearing about her in pain and agony. Okay, we get it after reading about it the WHOLE novel! Now can she please pick herself up and make herself useful?     Katniss doesn't deserve the title \\"girl who was on fire\\" and to be the main character in such an epic setting and story. Sure, she can be on fire, but only when someone sets her on fire or directs her to be on fire, not of her own doing. She was soulless and indifferent and cared about herself and her own feelings more than anyone else's (seeing as how she spends most of the novel grieving for herself and almost never for anyone else) .. if the main character, the narrator, doesn't care about anything and has no passion, why should we? What's the point when the main character whose eyes we're seeing through has no heart and no passion? And what happened to the selfless girl who willingly sacrificed her life to save her sister?     The things I did like. I liked that Katniss had 2 seconds of mental clarity and shot Coin instead of Snow (the only time in the book when she was truly thinking clearly and acting of her own accord). I wonder if I'm giving her too much credit though; judging from her selfish one-track mind in this book, I fear that she did this only because Coin killed Prim, not because she saw the bigger picture. Worse yet, I fear this may just have been a result of Snow's manipulation, not her own decision. I also feel the significance and bravery of this smart moment was rendered meaningless by her immediate cowardly reaction: instead of having conviction in her action and facing the consequences, she scrambled frantically to find the most painless and quickest way to kill herself. She never once in the book acknowledges all she has to live for and all the positive things she still has in her life. When a character's will to survive is absent through a whole novel, I as a reader have no desire for them to live either; grant their wish already! But to continue on .. I liked learning about more of the characters in depth: Gale (who I grew to love even more in this book), Finnick, Annie, Boggs, Johanna, etc. I liked the ending passages (fitting and beautifully haunting) and I liked the songs (The Hanging Tree and the meadow one). There are probably some other things that I'll update this review with once disappointment and frustration are no longer clouding my brain.     I wouldn't have minded so much if it had been a page-turner that was exciting to read, but trying to finish this book felt like a chore. When reading for enjoyment starts feeling like a chore, that's the ultimate sign that I dislike the book. 90% of the book, Katniss was wandering aimlessly through hallways, drugged out on morphling, hiding in a closet, or lying in a hospital bed. This book seriously dragged and dragged and dragged, and just got slower and slower until everyone started dropping dead towards the last quarter of the book. The Hunger Games, I couldn't put it down; for this, I dreaded picking it up to finish it. I did tons of things in between reading this book (doing my nails, watching TV, taking a walk, etc) because I couldn't read it in one sitting without wanting to gouge my eyes out. It was the same reoccurring theme: Katniss was manipulated and controlled by everyone around her and she didn't think or do anything of her own will. It got old.     I read all this build-up and didn't get rewarded for it. And even though the rebels triumphed, I didn't feel anything for them, not relief, not happiness, just nothing. I was just detached. And none of it was thanks to Katniss: her only role in the Capitol's defeat was watching Prim die, getting burned, and waking up in a hospital, where we're TOLD instead of SHOWN how the Capitol fell (all while she was unconscious, an occurrence that's way too common in this book).   Again, anti-climactic! During the scene when it really mattered!     I understand the message Collins is trying to convey and I agree with it: that war is awful and no one truly wins. And good and bad are not clearly defined black and white. (It got too preachy at certain points though, didn't it?) And I understand that not all books are unicorns-and-ponies happy endings, and that this series has always been intense and dark and a bit bleak. But that only works when there's an underlying message of hope and of optimism. I felt it in the 1st books, but this ending was devoid of all hope and happiness. Yes, humans are disgusting creatures who hurt and kill one another, who do horrible things because of greed and selfishness and just pure malice. But humans are also capable of love and compassion and kindness, and I wish she'd incorporated a bit of that into the story as well so there'd be a more hopeful ending. Even in real life, no matter how bad things may be, there is always hope. Isn't that the kind of message you really want young people to be left with? Instead of pessimistic doom and \\"give up on mankind\\"? I finished the book feeling hopeless and lost and depressed, and not in that deep, profound way where it motivates me to get up off my ass and do something to make a difference.     Gosh, at least Harry was his own person and got to face Voldemort in the end. What did Katniss get to do except be an empty canvas for them to paint and feed lines to?     Though I guess since I'm feeling so passionately about all of this, it wasn't a worthless read. It was just very, VERY disappointing.     Edit:   That's the end of the review and you can stop here but I wanted to add on .. and I'm thinking those who grew up with Harry Potter like I did can relate:   So I decided to re-read Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows to prepare myself for the upcoming movie, and to get the bitter taste of Mockingjay out of my mouth, and here's a passage towards the endwhere Harry's character really touched me and left me in awe:     \\"Because,\\" said Harry, \\"sometimes you've got to think about more than your own safety! Sometimes you've got to think about the greater good! This is war!\\"   \\"You're seventeen, boy!\\"   \\"I'm of age, and I'm going to keep fighting even if you've given up!\\"   a few sentences later .. \\"I'm going to keep going until I succeed -- or I die. Don't think I don't know how this might end. I've known it for years.\\"     Reading it again makes me all emotional and teary all over again, from Dobby's heartfelt burial to Harry's courageous walk to his death in the forest, knowing fully well what awaits him and yet willing to sacrifice himself for others and for a better world ...all the while, struggling with his fears and the temptation to run away .. and I swear, tears of pride and joy sprang from my eyes and exhilaration shot through my veins when Harry stepped up and faced his enemy with confidence, strength, wisdom.   Whatever faults the last HP book may have, I just have to say: Thank you, Harry, for giving me hope again and proving there are still admirable heroes in young literature.
0439023513|5.0|I hadn't been as excited for a book to release since HP and The Deathly Hallows.  I wasn't disappointed then, and I wasn't disappointed now.  Suzanne Collins writes beautifully and ties up all loose ends. I was worried that this book would be lacking, and at times boring,seeing as the Games were over and this book was to be about the rebellion.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that it wasn't really all that different.  While the story changed a tad, the structure was still there.  From Katniss composing herself after leaving the arena, to her prep teaming getting her ready for the propos, to her actually breaching the Capitol (which is defended by many of the atrocities you'd find in an arena}.   The deaths were heartbreaking, as you've come to really root for and love these characters.  There was a certain death that left me feeling as though I'd been caught in the wave by the tar pod.  You see and feel how badly war can destroy people. The living more so than the dead.  I've read reviews from people complaining that Katniss changed too much, or that she was too cold. Of course Katniss doesn't end this book being the same girl who stepped up to save Prim from the reaping. She's been a pawn of two conflicting governments for far too long.  She is broken.  Perhaps forever.    THe ONLY thing that I didn't like about this book, was Katniss' vote for the final Hunger Games of the children of the Capitol.   The Katniss that I've known all this time, who never have voted in favor for this, no matter how broken she was.  She knows better than anyone how wrong it is to punish children because of an adults mistakes.

0316067938|3.0|By all accounts I should hate the Twilight Saga. I hate the two main characters Bella and Edward. Bella is maybe the worst female protagonist in the history of fiction. She is selfish, whiny, needy and so inept with out her Edward. Edward is arrogant, rude and uber-controlling. I disliked them in Twilight and it just got worse in New Moon and the following novels.    While reading the novels I could not understand how young girls and women related to these books. Bella is such the anti-feminist role model that I would have thought most females would be up in arms about such a female character. I know this saga is a love story and fantasy but at what cost to the female psych. I know Mrs. Meyer is not responsible to create a role model for young women but to create a character this weak defies description.    How can anyone like Edward Cullen? Yes he is beautiful, has a good body and is strong (which we are told in detail 1000 times per novel by Bella) but what else is there. He is not suave or debonair. He is 107 years old but sometimes acts like a petulant teenager. Plus he is hard as a statue and cold. Who want to touch, kiss, lie next to and have sex with a statue?    After reading all 4 novels I can say without a doubt my favorite character is Jacob Black. I know Bella was destined to be with Edward but I was always rooting for Jacob. Regardless if Jacob turns into a wolf, he would have made a better life partner for Bella. With Jacob, Bella could be herself, not have to change, be happy, be around family and friends and have kids if she wanted to (although these last points are negated by Breaking Dawn). Jacob could be immature but I chalk that up to him being 16 years old. Bella always seemed obsessed with Edward. With Jacob she just seemed relaxed and happy.    Breaking Dawn has divided the Twilight nation. You either love it or hate it. I'm on the fence surprisingly. By every right I should hate this novel. It has many inconsistencies with earlier canon established in the earlier novels. Edward should not be able to impregnate Bella! The author states that vampires do not have bodily fluids other than venom. How can you then have your main character get pregnant? The only reason I accepted this while reading the novel is that I had already heard of this plot point before I read it. I originally had no desire to read these novels so the fact that I had heard this before did not bother me. Recently a close friend recommended that I read these novels and I decided to give this series a shot.     I should despise the author having Jacob imprint on Renesme. I am by no means a pedophile or a pedophile sympathizer. However, given that this plot point is borderline pedophilia it did not bother me. While reading Twilight I decided to turn off my rational brain and accept what I was reading while I read it. After learning that these vampires \\"sparkle\\" in the sun, I just decided to go with the flow. After it was foreshadowed when another wolf imprinted with an infant, I just decided to accept things as they happened. I gave the author the benefit of the doubt when she explicitly stated that imprinting with an infant is like the love between a brother and sister. It does not turn into sexual love until the child becomes an adult. Yes, this is kind of creepy but again I just went with the flow.    Although I despise the name, I like the character Renesme. I have a hard time disliking a baby no matter how contrived her existence might be. The fact that she is so adorable and likeable won me over.    If I had my way Jacob would have imprinted with Leah Clearwater. It looked like the author was leading that way when Leah joined Jacob's pack. They developed a grudging respect for each other and Leah was ready to follow Jacob to the ends of the Earth. I have a feeling that Mrs. Meyer hates the character Leah. Not only does she lose her boyfriend Sam to her sister, she had to follow him as leader of the pack. So basically she has to be around her lost love constantly. To add injury to insult she leaves Sam's pack, joins Jacob's pack and has to be around her sworn enemies the vampires. Not only that but she has to sit back and watch her pack leader imprint with a vampire child while she is doomed to a life of celibacy and a childless existence.    I had no expectations that we were going to get a great Edward/Bella love scene. Knowing the authors religious background, I knew the sex would be chaste. And since these books were written for tweens and young teens, I knew any sexual description would be PG. Plus I did not like the characters anyway so I did not care whether they had great sex, good sex, bad sex or no sex at all.    I was not disappointed with anti-climactic Volturi fight either. I could foresee a confrontation but not an actual brawl. All of the Cullen clan vampires (except for Emmet) only wanted to talk to save Renesme's life. When this was discussed over and over again I knew we were not going to get a fight. Plus there has never been that much action in the books to begin with. Whatever fighting there has been in previous books has been dealt with in under 5 pages. Again, knowing this author's MO, I knew there was not going to be a fight because that would have meant killing some major characters. This was not happening in this series.    In conclusion, I do not regret reading this series. Would I have ended things differently? Yes. Regardless of how poor the writing was I did finish all the books rather quickly. I will compare this series to junk food. It is poor writing but you want to stick around and see how thing turn out in the end no matter how unsatisfying.

B00000DUE7|4.0|Un'edizione straordinariamente bella: cantanti e cori splendidi, orchestra e solisti assolutamente precisi e mai monotoni. Sicuramente l'edizione più completa della musica sacra di Vivaldi, avendo King incluso nell'integrale anche le \\"varianti\\" di alcune opere (tipo il Magnificat) che mancano nell'opera omnia di Vittorio Negri (distribuita dalla Philips).  La ripresa del suono risulta sempre accuratissima, tutti i cd restituiscono all'ascoltatore un perfetto scenario sonoro.  E allora perché solo quattro stelle? Perché dal punto di vista editoriale il box è veramente deludente: ogni cd è contenuto in una custodia di cartone, le esegesi sono raccolte in un unico booklet di mediocre leggibilità.  Per una registrazione di questa importanza e con quello che costa il cofanetto, si doveva e si poteva fare molto di più: ad esempio, creare un box più largo ed inserire all'interno i cd dell'edizione in jewel-case.

B0036EH3WK|5.0|As it has already been debated in reviews and on forums, I'm not going to comment on Lost as a series, other than to state that I loved it - I'd have to go back to the original Star Trek to name a series that so held my attention.  Why would I have bought the complete series on Blu-ray if it hadn't?  So, here is my review on the particulars in this collection.<br /><br />The 1080p image quality on Blu-ray is spectacular, far eclipsing what could be seen either on the original ABC broadcast (even HD broadcast, which was 720p) and the conventional DVD issues.  Hitherto unseen details are readily apparent here, starting in the opening minutes of the pilot, where the bamboo forest is dazzlingly clear, as is the riveting post crash sequence.  If you don't already have a Blu-ray player, this set is good incentive to get one.  From what I can see, there has been no digital noise reduction, so there are instances of grain, especially in darker sequences - but this is not distracting, and adds to the gritty realism of the show.  In short, the video quality is far above what is seen on modern series television, and looks more like a big budget movie.<br /><br />Audio is also superb, with 5.1 mix for English leading the pack.  Dialogue is boldly front & center, with plenty of activity in the surround channels.  But unlike many 5.1 mixes, the dialogue is never swamped.  5.1 audio is also available for French, European Spanish, and Brazilian Portuguese.  Latin American Spanish is available in stereo only.<br /><br />There are over 30 options for subtitles, including, but not limited to, English, Spanish (both European & Latin American), Portuguese, Swedish, Thai, Korean, and a host of others.  The subtitles are offered both as dialogue only, or with descriptions for the hearing impaired.  Caveat: Not all spoken language and subtitles appear in each episode.  Options are inconsistent, which is rather annoying.<br /><br />Beyond the extras that came with the previous sets (bloopers, behind the scenes featurettes, interviews, all of which are ported over to the complete collection) there are some additional goodies that come with the boxed set.  For the most part, these are of the toy/game variety: a map of the island, Senet gameboard with white and black stones for playing, a log entry from the Black Rock, a black-light for viewing some hidden items, and an ankh with a hidden hieroglyphic message from Jacob - the message deals with how to find an additional disc hidden in the box.<br /><br />Now to the bonus disc: the disc is hidden under the map of the island on the underside of the box top.  The easiest way to get to it is to place the box top with the &#34;LOST&#34; side down on a hard surface.  While holding that in place, turn the map ¼ turn clockwise, then carefully lift the map off the box top.  If you try to simply yank the map off the box top without turning it, you'll damage the tabs that hold the map in place.  The bonus disc multiple features and Easter Eggs (Lostpedia has information on how to access the Eggs), including directions for how to play the Senet game.<br /><br />If you loved Lost, you'll probably want to get this set.  It's a true collector's item.  If you're unfamiliar with Lost or lukewarm on it, but want to see more, my advice would be to sample episodes from a rental service or your local library before diving into this collection.iews, all of which are ported over to the complete collection) there are some additional goodies that come with the boxed set.

0439023513|5.0|This is the third and final book in The Hunger Games trilogy. I enjoyed all three tremendously.  The Mockingjay begins with Katniss distraught that she was saved from the arena, but Peeta was not. Throughtout the story, again Katniss must battle with her feelings between Peeta and Gale. Gale becomes more and more determined to bring down the Capital by any means possible, while Katniss becomes the Mockingjay the symbol of rebellion, unity, and hope.<br /><br />After capture, President Snow controls and uses Peeta against Katniss. She eventually recognizes Snow's intensions and sees Peeta's trauma and completely unravels. She must struggle with Peeta's condition, and even must decide between killing him as he begs for death or continuing to care for him even though he is a severe liability.  Other characters from Catching Fire become more prominent and critical in the rebellion cause; they are all brave, but unfortunately not all survive.  As Gale and Katniss fight in the different districts, she becomes more aware of what Gale is willing to do in order to win, and fights with the morality of his choices.  The list of deaths is disturbing and in the end Katniss must identify who \\"the real enemy is\\" as Haymitch and Peeta have always reminded her to do. The Capital becomes the final arena, but this time the only target is President Snow. In the end, someone extremely close to her dies, and Katniss realizes between Gale and Peeta \\"who she cannot live without\\".  It was a rewarding end to a great trilogy.<br /><br />I won't give too much, because I encourage everyone to pick up this fast and fun trilogy... and if you were curious, I was always team Peeta from beginning to end.

0439023513|5.0|Peeta has been captured. District 12 has been completely obliterated. And broken Katniss wants to see the ashes that remain. So with Gale at her side she ascends from the depths of District 13 to her former home. President Coin and the rebellion need her, and she's not cooperating. But maybe this will help Katniss consent to being their symbol of freedom, of uprising, of defiance: the Mockingjay. Of many questions she has, why now after excluding her from the planning, and is this really in her best interest and that of Panem on the whole? Burying her fear and anger, Katniss realizes the success of the rebellion is on her shoulders regardless of the cost to her and the people that matter most.    Being honest, I'm still in disbelief. Disbelief that my first experience of Mockingjay is over and sadness that the series has come to an end. After a late night of happy and nervous anticipation waiting for my copy, I spent the next night and two days frantically reading in the biggest doses I could manage. I wanted to read fast and just as the previous two books, Suzanne Collins made it impossible not to. As a result I was left exhausted in all ways and a little numb. I knew the war to follow would be dark and heartbreaking, but I was still taken aback by how quickly and pervasively the violence, death, loss, and heartache accumulated. That's not to say Mockingjay is without its moments of humor and tender exchanges, but this is heavy material.    As has been constant in the series, Collin's signature plot twists and turns are here, and more than ever I was guessing wrong and finding the buildup and conclusion not as I had imagined or expected. While I thought a few minor decisions were uncharacteristic, the ending is real and the direction fits the story and characters. Epilogues can be hit or miss but this one was perfect. The last few pages in fact were understated and beautiful and beg for a re-read. Overall Mockingjay was a bombarding, emotional, mind-blowing read that can't get much better.
B000WC39SG|5.0|A terrific film version of Ryan's book, a \\"Bridge too Far.\\"  The film is very well done, and is an excellent dramatization  of a serious military disappointment by the British.  Acting by an all star cast of English, German and American actors,   with one or two minor exceptions, is first-rate. James Caan, Dick Bogard, Sean Connery, Anthony Hopkins, and Maximillian   Schell are outstanding in this gritty and demanding story of events gone awry for the Allies in WWII. Photography, colors,   and costumes are technically and visually as precise as possible. A must see film for anyone interested in this tragic   set-back for the British during WWII.

B001P9EQH8|5.0|I didnt think this little amp will boost my headphones sooo much. Ive got the Sennheiser HD202 and i bought the HD 228 which was really bad cuz of the loudness(they weren't loud at all)and now im not regretting  buying them cuz this little amp changed my mind. It's little enough to put it on your belt it got all the accessories  with it. And about the quality it seems sturdy and got good build. THis amp gives new life to the headphones. I attached the HD228 but they were even more quieter than before and the sound was coming only from the one side, well soon i noticed that i didnt attached them properly u need to stick it really hard (thats good side cuz it not gonna come off easy) now the sound was coming from the both sides but the sound was still not loud, so as soon as i turned on the volume on the E5 amp i was stunned.... It gave the headphones 150% more louder sound ( im listening on Samsung P2 and my volume is always 15 which was loud enough on my HD202 but not on my HD228) now while the volume is on max on the amp i cant stand the loudness from the HD228 and i cant even put the HD202 on my ears(cuz they too loud). This is excellent product and for the money u paying for it its like a joke.. Superb FiiO E5 portable Amp... Recommending to everyone...
B0006GAI6O|5.0|GREAT PERFORMANCE BY RICHARD GERE
B003O85W3A|4.0|El album es muy muy bueno, ciertamente no como los dos anteriores (el realmente fantástico \\"Funeral\\" y el sublime \\"Neon Bible\\"), pero si eres fan o no de la banda te va a encantar, está visto que hacen las cosas bien y \\"The Suburbs\\" no es la excepción. Debo mencionar que no todas la canciones me gustan o no tanto, a diferencia de lo que me sucedió con los otros dos albums, por lo que yo le doy al disco un 8.5 (y no es que me quiera hacer pasar por crítico de música), sobra decir que es una calificación para estándares propios de \\"Arcade Fire\\", así termina siendo un album absolutamente recomendable.

B003L77TZI|5.0|Do you ever feel berried deep? six feet under and no one ever hears a thing? Katy Perry came out strong with \\"Teenage Dream\\" from soft melodies to the up-right club type. You can't go wrong with it! buy one, two, three or even 10 like me. :)    P.O.
B001IXSU8M|2.0|Her music is too theatrical.  She has a very good singing voice, but too much flair to her songs.  Speechless, from another album, is a great song and showcases her excellent singing voice.  She kind of wastes it, but the in crowd seems to like it because it's mindless funk.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This headset is way better than any other I have ever used, and I cannot reccomend it enough. It was very easy to set up, and the wired connection for charging is very clever in how it was designed. Its very easy to keep the cables nice and neat while still being able to charge it when you need it to.    The wireless range is great - it will work just fine all over my entire 2 bedroom apartment, which is particularly nice given that the buttons on the side of the headset are programmed to control the pause/play for music even when I am far away from my PC    Yes, there is a bit of plastic near the ears that make a bit of a creaking sound, which may possibly annoy some people. But don't let that dissuade you! It provides a very nice, clear, crisp sound. The microphone is excellent as well.     7.1 surround doesn't seem \\"perfect,\\" as it is a software surround sound solution, but it sure gives a nice effect and makes the games I play (World of Warcraft, Starcraft 2, Modern Warfare 2) feel very immersive. Voice chat over Ventrilo and Teamspeak works very nicely as well.    All in all, if you are in the market for a very nice, wireless PC headset, this is a great choice.
B003Y3ZTGA|2.0|She's trying to copy all other bouncy gimmicky bubble gum stuff that just sounds the same.  You can't tell one song or singer from the next.  She should take a sleeping pill, grow up and get mellow.  She might have a semi-decent singing voice if she sang a ballad, bot not sure.

The author's introductory quote from Frederick Maitland's view of trusts deliberately emphasizes the point that attaching `an obligation of conscience to the title to property' formed, in Maitland's words, \\"perhaps the greatest and most distinctive achievement of English lawyers\\", finding no equivalent in foreign law.  Trusts exemplify `English legal genius' at its best  -- and just to make sure you get the message, the author lightheartedly prefaces his comments with those lines from Gilbert & Sullivan's `HMS Pinafore'...'for in spite of all temptations, to belong to other nations, He remains an Englishman!'<br /><br />So if you are a legal practitioner with a burgeoning offshore practice, rest assured: there is a corner of that increasingly complex foreign field of trusts that remains forever England.  However -- it is noted in the text that because trusts have an identifiable `common core' consisting of (a) asset segregation and (b) fiduciary administration by trustee for beneficiary...it is therefore possible to `recognize trusts in jurisdictions sharing different legal traditions.'<br /><br />`International Trust Laws' (in the author's words) `considers the main aspects of international trust laws, with reference to express private trusts, primarily in a private donative context as well as in respect of commercial applications'.  Covering at least 26 different jurisdictions, the book attempts (and in my view succeeds) in reflecting the wide diversity within the international dimension of trust law.<br /><br />Logically structured in five parts, the book covers the creation of trusts...the powers and duties of trustees...trustee liability...control mechanisms...and special uses of trusts. Following a general pattern, each chapter starts with the development of the English traditional model, then reviews legislative developments in various offshore jurisdictions, both in the common law and civil law traditions.<br />The extensive Tables of Cases (listed alphabetically by country) and of Legislation, plus excellent index, make this an instructive and easy to use work of reference.<br /><br />For both private and commercial clients, the world, as was once predicted, is fast becoming a `global village' which is why the copiously researched and lucidly written International Trust Laws is an important book.  Read it and you will certainly acquire a broader understanding of... and certainly a global perspective on, trusts.ercial applications'.

0199218668|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3VKJ69J77064S]]A HISTORY OF CONTEMPORARY POLICING BY A POLICEMAN<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />`Why a history of the police?' asks Dr Timothy Brain in one of the very pertinent subheads his text.  Well why indeed?<br /><br />His short answer is that `the full story of the police service's contribution to the survival of British democracy has yet to be told'.  That of course offers up a perspective on the police and police work that many people will find startling, given that the police as an institution are perceived to be not without flaws -- which makes Brain's formidable work of scholarship all the more valuable.  With a lengthy list of credentials -- including Chief Constable of Gloucestershire from 2001 to 2010 and visiting professor at London South Bank and Gloucestershire Universities and Honorary Senior Research Fellow at Cardiff University -- Brain writes from personal experience as a police officer, with the discipline and detachment of the professional historian.<br /><br />`A History of Policing in England and Wales From 1974'  makes fascinating reading -- admirably filling what appears to be a yawning gap, not only in the availability of books on subject of the police, but in any extensive examination of the police at all in standard histories, or social analyses of contemporary Britain.<br /><br />Yes, there is T.A. Critchley's standard work `A History of the Police in England and Wales', but it stops in 1974 , which means that  Dr Brain has very ably taken up Critchley's baton in this thorough, comprehensive and readable volume.<br /><br />Revealing the interaction between the great events of the turbulent post-1974 period and contemporary politics and policing, the book charts the evolution of the 43-force structure of the police in England and Wales from its creation to the present day.  Most noteworthy is the extent to which political decisions on the direction and ethos of policing reflect and in turn influence social change, including attempts at social reform.<br /><br />In offering a perspective on contemporary social history that is almost unique, the book is a boon to researchers in this field as well as general readers, especially with its extremely useful 14 page bibliography plus comprehensive index. As a `near history' of the very recent, rather than distant past, the book will no doubt elicit its share of controversy and comment.  What isn't controversial is the erudition, insight and lucidity with which Brain, writing from experience, presents this important work.influence social change, including attempts at social reform.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I haven't read it, but my preteen daughter loved it.  She's a moderate reader - it's not her preferred hobby but she reads for pleasure some.  She read this one through almost cover to cover nonstop.  Said it was very sad but a terrific read.
019925883X|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo25X6QY9ELM40W]]An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Devotees of that formidably superb series, `The Oxford History of the Laws of England' will be delighted that the last three volumes of the series, Volumes XI, XII and XIII are now out and about - published as a set - for the edification of legal scholars everywhere, as well as interested general readers.<br /><br />They cover 1820-1914 - from the coronation of George IV to the outbreak of World War I -- the Great War -- against Germany.  The dizzying pace of economic, technological and social change during this turbulent period - encompassing the Victorian era of course -- gave rise to momentous legal developments and in turn were profoundly affected by them.<br /><br />Like the rest of the series, which, commendably, draws heavily on research using unpublished materials, these three volumes provide a detailed survey of English law, its institutions and the historical forces which impinged on them.<br /><br />As the authors point out in the introduction, `any legal history worth salting' must deal not only with the law, but how and why it developed - `the shifts in the law itself and the rationalizations offered for them'.  A legal history should also look at outcomes, say the authors,`for most legal change produces unintended effects.' And so it transpires in these three erudite and very readable volumes.<br /><br />Volume XI deals for the most part with the structure of the English legal system, including its constitutional framework. Volume XII deals with Private law and its evolution and adaptation to a more complex age, expanding on issues concerning property, contract, commercial law and tort.<br /><br />Volume XIII covers five `topics', enumerated by the authors in the endearingly titled `Manifest' (Most authors would call this a `preface', wouldn't they, or maybe a `foreword'?<br /><br />But no, these volumes have a `manifest' instead, like a ship's manifest which lists the ship's cargo.  `Here, it is the readers who undertake the inspection of the hold,' the authors add in a droll footnote.) Now that's what we like; solid scholarship enlivened with just a light touch of whimsy here and there.  But we digress.<br /><br />Volume XIII's five topics include criminal law, law as an instrument of social protection and control, family law, labour law and rights relating to personality and intellectual property.  The focus is on the major ways in which all these aspects of law changed between 1820 and 1914 and, we might add, shaped the modern world.<br /><br />Eminently readable, the volumes also provide Tables of Cases and of Statutes.  There is a Names Index and Volumes XI and XII and a subject index.  In Volume XIII, these indices cover all three volumes, so you have little excuse not to be able to find what you're looking for therein.<br /><br />If you are seeking that special insight and degree of authority, conferred by depth of understanding and breadth of knowledge of the development and evolution of the law, we can scarcely think of a more vital and valuable addition to your law library.go.  `Here, it is the readers who undertake the inspection of the hold,' the authors add in a droll footnote.)

B003JTHESA|3.0|I have tried to LOVE this album since I first bought it, thinking it would grow on me the more I listened to it. I do love a few songs on it, but the majority is boring. I really didn't expect much from this album after hearing the El-Dorado track live in concert a few weeks before the album was released. If it doesn't do much for me live in concert, then the studio release isn't going to be any better. I love Iron Maiden, even the newer stuff (Brave new world, Matter of life and Death ect) but this album is just boring to me. I would have given it a lower rating, but I just can't seem to do that to Iron Maiden.
0439023513|2.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" ranks as one of my favorite books. Suzanne Collins created spunky characters that were mature, yet still coming of age. She gave us a gritty, near-future world, and a book that served as a cautionary tale. The suspense was unrelenting. The relationships felt fully realized.<br /><br />\\"Chasing Fire\\" continued in the same vein, although it seemed to go over some of the same territory, while building us toward the trilogy's conclusion. I waited with bated breath. My teen daughter joined me in the excitement. When \\"Mockingjay\\" hit the shelves, we picked it up that very first day of release.<br /><br />\\"Mockingjay\\" takes us back into the thoughts of Katniss Everdeen, a woman with little self-pity and a woman of action. In this book, though, she becomes somewhat self-absorbed, with her interior monologue dominating the story, and she is hesitant to act for far too long. When she and her fellow survivors head off, at last, into the Capitol for a confrontation with President Snow and his Peacekeepers, I thrilled to know we would finally get the climax this trilogy had been building toward. Sadly, this is not the case. A character who has been absent from the story for a hundred pages suddenly appears and dies. A character who has been disoriented for most of the story suddenly becomes rational again. A character we've come to care about suddenly becomes a person of rage (or so Katniss tells us) and is discarded far too quickly from her thoughts. The showdown between Katniss and her archenemy never really pans out, and when she makes her final irrevocable decision, it is one at odds with her own vote only pages before.<br /><br />I love Collins' writing, and she gives us quality characters, settings, and conflicts once again. Like John Christopher did in his \\"Tripod Trilogy,\\" she makes some wry social commentary, while telling a fast-paced tale. With the burden of two great books before, she stumbles here, though, trying to be original and unpredictable, but in the end only being annoying. In the previous books, I felt caught up in the middle of the action, while I felt like only an outside observer here. Even with the last ten pages providing some closure, it was not enough to overcome my disappointment. My expectations were shot down as though by Katniss's own arrows.g annoying.

B000YIGNKE|1.0|I must admit that I didn't get very far into this film. I could not believe that the director chose to go with a hand-held, shaky camera. So we're supposed to believe this is some kind of reality show?! If you're fairly blind to cinematography, you might like this thing, but otherwise avoid it..especially if hand-held camera makes you sick. It's sad that cinematogaphy is getting so unprofessional in so many movies, especially on television.  We're entering a dark age.
0439023513|1.0|Suzanne Collins needs to know when to stop. She also needs to know that the formula she's using just isn't good enough anymore or fresh. Not that the first book was fresh to begin with, but honestly, The Hunger Games was so good it didn't need to be a trilogy. Collins has become a paycheque writer, and this book clearly shows.<br /><br />The first book, The Hunger Games, had me on the edge of my seat from page one to the last. I loved it. Like I said, it wasn't original or fresh but it was a damn good book and some quality reading in a time of pale teen vampire fiction and an overall weak YRCA season. Then it fell flat on its face. Catching Fire was awful. 2/3 of the book was a teen drama, then the last 3rd had all the action, except it excited me no where near as much as the first book. And now with Mockingjay, I've come to the conclusion that sometimes, great books just aren't meant to be trilogies.<br /><br />First off, Katniss. She has basically become the equvalent of Bella in Twilight. Yes I am saying that. She annoyed the hell out of me here. She has become incredibly whiny and every flip of the page had me wanting to tear my hair off. Peeta... ugh, it makes me sick to even think of what Collins did to a likable character. Now he's a shell of his former self, and he basically hates Katniss now because she wasn't there when he was tortured and what not. Not even gonna mention Gale. He's basically not in it in the last half, therefore he's useless.<br /><br />The plot is basically NON EXISTENT. There's too many dream/flashback sequences. The transitions between these scenes is just jarring. Katniss spends 80% of the book crying and moaning and bitching, and then of course near the end, Prim dies. WTF???????? And then the ending... so yeah Peeta tries to kill Katniss, all of a sudden they make up for it and are living in District 12 and having babies. UGH.<br /><br />Seriously... just don't read past book 1. You'll be glad you didn't. I wish I'd have just avoided the sequels. Way to pee all over your great tale, Suzanne.ver your great tale, Suzanne.
B003JTHETY|3.0|This is the first Iron Maiden CD that I've bought sense 1998 the \\"Somewhere In Time\\" album. After that I drifted away from Iron Maiden.   So today (August 26,2010) I was in my local HASTINGS looking around and low-and-behold what did I come across but a brand new Iron Maiden CD.   I debated over getting regular edition or the Mission Edition. I springs for the Mission Edition.   I opened the metal case in the car. Saw that there was just one CD in it.   I thought to myself it must be an enhanced CD.   I listened to the CD on my way home. Great album!   I got home put it in the computer and found only 10 songs on the disc and nothing else.   Then I started checking out the booklet and case.   I found on the back of the tin case a web address.   I went to the address and a little app popped up asking to verify the CD.   So I let the app do what it needed to do in order to verify my \\"legal\\" copy of the album.   When it did all that, a web page opened up and a whole not of nothing was seen(content that was not $worth$ seeing.)   What a wast of $2.00! Great album, p.o.s. special edition.   Don't get the Mission Edition. Get the regular edition.   If you get the regular edition you won't be missing out on anything and saving yourself $2.00 in the process.

0307454541|2.0|The protagonist of this book is a financial reporter: cold, one-dimensional, a foil for all the sick and deranged people he comes into contact with. He's selfish and indifferent to others' feelings, and for no reason women can't keep their hands off him. One woman attacks him 15 minutes after meeting him.<br /><br />The first half of the book is slow and plodding. It consists mostly of interviews and monologues. The subject of these interviews is somewhat interesting, but they're told in such a straight, nonfiction way that you can't help but think the book should be about THIS, not about the reporter who is looking into it 40 years later.<br /><br />At about the midway point, the ball finally gets rolling. But the story fails to hit any high points or sustain suspense. Old photographs are used as a plot device way too often. Every major development in the plot is driven by the discovery of some old photograph that no one saw before. Repetitive much?<br /><br />The main plot is bracketed by the protagonist's struggle to clear his name of libel charges he made against a major industrialist. Arbitrarily at the end of the book the reader expects a promise made in the beginning to be fulfilled, but it's not; then a development in the form of a deux ex machina saves the day. Not only is it boring, but it doesn't fit with the whole of the story. It would have been better to pepper it throughout the bulk of the book.<br /><br />I hated the characterizations of this book. There are several characters who are married, but they are openly unfaithful, and no one seems to care. The protagonist makes foolish, disgusting evaluations of the Christian religious beliefs of his own daughter, despite that it obviously helps make her a better person. Surprise, surprise, he's an atheist. Welcome to Sweden.<br /><br />Also, the eponymous character's bad attitude and self-pity is very irritating at key points. She finds herself in a predicament because she refuses to demonstrate to Sweden's welfare authorities that she's really not insane. But her nihilism keeps her from doing so, and she ends up in a bad spot because of it. Stupid.<br /><br />But the biggest problem of the book is that too much is explained to the reader. One of the things they teach you in creative writing class is not to explain, but to show.not insane. But her nihilism keeps her from doing so, and she ends up in a bad spot because of it. Stupid.

0199535639|5.0|A small group of friends and I read THE WOMAN IN WHITE for a month-long blog read-a-long. I was thrilled when this book got chosen because, honestly, it'd been far too long since I read it and the entire thing felt fresh and new.<br /><br />One of the most fantastic women in literature (in my opinion) occupies the pages of this book.  Marian Halcombe is a strong, man-like woman who frequently attacks her own sex with tongue in cheek remarks about their weaknesses. More than that, however, she shows a strength of character that carries the entire story - even so much as to inspire the respect of the goosebump-causing Count Fosco.<br /><br />Speaking of Count Fosco - I don't think there could be a villain who makes my skin crawl more.  He's not evil in the typical sense, it's nothing you can actually put a finger on and his admiration of Marian seems to be at total odds with his actions throughout the book.  He's a fantastic character and one I aspire to be able to write myself one day.<br /><br />The pace of this book moves so slowly it's nearly impossible to keep your mind from going over and over the details.  Each section of the mystery is given to you from the viewpoint of the person who has seen it - much like the testimony of a witness during a murder trial. There are obviously parts of the book that were more shocking back in Collins day then today, but...I still had a blast reading it and even gasped once or twice!<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves murder mysteries. While wordy, it is still not intimidating and relatively easy to read.  And.. how can you resist after hearing about the characters of Fosco and Marian?
0439023513|4.0|The beginning of the book brings you up to speed as to where we are all at this time.  A few things have happened between books - and Katniss is torn as to what to do now.  Her family is safe, but at what cost?  She is being asked to play yet another role that she is not sure she wants any part of - at 17 she is tired and broken.<br /><br />I enjoyed how Susanne Collins starts the book, while it is a bit slow and filled with details that may bother the eager reader, I didn't mind it as I didn't really want it to end.  And no worries, there is plenty of action, plenty of old characters and new and when the book takes off - we are all literally on the run.<br /><br />There are surprises along the way and that is what I will discuss more in the spoiler section.  I highly recommend the series and encourage you if you have not already to get your hands on Hunger Games and find out for yourself the magic within this series.  I like books that are not cookie cutter copies of a story that I have already read and Suzanne Collins really takes this series out of the typical ring and makes it unique and memorable.

B003HFFVDQ|2.0|Most of this album is just not good at all, especially if you liked exit planet dust.  Listened to all songs including the iTunes bonus track only available there for some reason.  let me tell you : don't even worry about not having that one, it is terrible lol.  What this album does have is one real gem of a track K+ B+ D.  A couple other tracks are ok.  Escape velocity has an unnecessarily long build up but does at least deliver a nice driving bass line, for a bit, before returning to pointless ambience..  A lot of the other stuff i heard on this album was just boring and entirely without enough bass.  Ok to listen to once and then never really need to hear again.   The production value is good, it sounds crisp and vaguely cool but it is just way too slow and not nearly good enough to stand on it own as ambient music.  Because of the good sound quality, a dj with a bass machine and average talent could make a fortune remixing this album.   At least with kbd though, the chemical brothers provide a fleeting glimpse of what super coolness they are still capable of but strangely choose not to make more of.  I need to check if there is a single released for that song, if so i would rate it five stars.

I also enjoy California girls, and the beat to E.T. And thats about it. I was hoping for so much more. The album art is cute amd Im glad the lyrics were included. I also really enjoy when there are \\"secret tracks\\" like #13 and #14. So those are fun. I'm trying to stretch and play up this album but I just cant. Katy, all I can say is that I can tell that are going to be big for a long time because of who you are, but please put a new album out fast with some CONTENT on it!!! Love you!

Initially we learn to draw by observation, and then we learn to analyze and get into construction, drawing from memory, and so on.<br /><br />When it is time to produce consistent consumable art such as a graphic novel, or story illustration, reference is invaluable.<br /><br />There are essentially two things that give life to an illustration of people, first is the action, gesture or pose of the figure and the second is expression of the face. if we could get these right, then we can tell a story.<br /><br />For facial expressions, just like anything else the basics are essential, such as the anatomy of the face, the musculature, and the way it moves, twists and turns when the face takes different expressions. A study of basic expressions, and then more subtle variations, helps understand and clarify. While we may spend considerable amount of time in studying facial expressions, it can be daunting to remember all the variations, and bring about the exact subtlety while illustrating a picture.<br /><br />This is where this handy reference comes in. It can of course be used for studying expressions. But there are other books, such as the one by Gary Faigin. This is simply a photographic reference, which can be applied directly or abstracted into the situation as needed. There is also a companion volume for babies and teens and a wonderful website supporting these books.<br /><br />The book simply contains crisp, black and white photographs of expressions of various models of various types and ages.<br /><br />The book though large format, is printed on light paper, making it very flexible, and easy to use.
0380002930|3.0|Richard Adams' classic novel, set in Hampshire, England, is worth reading for memorable characters and a decent adventure story. The protagonists of the novel prevail through their fidelity to their true natures, while the villains fail because they have sacrificed their freedom to their desire for security.    The novel offers the reader some insight into real rabbit behavior, which, according to the front matter, the author gained from R.M. Lockley's The Private Life of the Rabbit.  To me, the best scenes were quiet ones, with the rabbits snug underground or outside feeding on grass under moonlight.      The only parts of the novel that didn't work for were the stories and legends that the rabbits tell one another about the mythical figures of Frith and El-ahrairah.  After the second one, I stopped reading them and stuck to the main plot.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|This is simply amazing and addicting. I wake up in the morning with these songs stuck in my head!
4789009637|5.0|This book is amazing.  It teaches you grammar quickly, in a way that makes sense.  Very few times I was confused with what was going on with this book.  I would advise you to have a dictionary with you (Or be at your computer with a dictionary site ready) because flipping pages is a pain sometimes.  There are plenty of examples that never try to trick you.<br /><br />Only downside is the audio tape isn't too helpful.  They pronounce all the words for you, and they read out certain scenarios, but they don't slow down.  Sure its great listening practice, but its very hard to do for a beginning student.  Believe me, listening to full pace Japanese is hard to make out.  If you want good listening comprehension, might want to go to rosetta stone or something.<br /><br />The kanji they teach is pretty good.  They dont go over radicals or anything, but they teach you about 20 of them then give you some reading exercises, repeat for about 160 or so.  Also, during the main lessons, all the kanji have furigana for you to read.  You may end up 'accidentally learning kanji' this way.  Where you see the same kanji enough times you just remember it without studying it.  Other books weren't so good at teaching kanji, or do so in a different manner.  Know that this book wont teach you all of the joyo kanji, not even close, but it gets you started with a few hundred of the most common ones.  It is very organized.<br /><br />PS: I recommend a dry erase whiteboard + a thick tip chisel dry erase marker for all your kanji drawing.  A pen and pad will not cut it.  Write down all the kanji you learn a few times, and try to remember it by parts. For example, ' This kanji is made up of 3 major parts. '(left side), '(top right) ''(bottom right). If you ever want to be good at writing kanji, you must identify these parts all the time. There are like 100-200 of these root pieces that make up every single kanji ever.  So in reality, you're just memorizing those and then knowing what kanji are made up of what.  Just know that learning kanji will suck no matter what, but this book makes it slightly less sucky.  I found it a bit fun to read their little stories, too.<br /><br />Keep in mind that the Genki series wont teach you -everything-, but it will get you started.  I've attained several Japanese textbooks and this one is the best.<br /><br />PS:  How each lesson works is they have a story at the beginning, then a few pages on the grammar tricks used in each story.  If you cant read a lesson without 100% understanding, don't advance.t learning kanji will suck no matter what, but this book makes it slightly less sucky.

0439023513|5.0|On page 377 of Mockingjay is everything this trilogy ([[ASIN:0439023483 The Hunger Games]], [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]] and now Mockingjay) is about:<br /><br />\\"...Something is significantly wrong with a creature that sacrifices its children's lives to settle its differences...The truth is, it benefits no one to live in a world where these things happen.\\"<br /><br />These three books work on several levels.  First and foremost, they are a riveting read, an action/adventure tale that sweeps you along from first page to last.  Katniss is a wonderful character, smart, strong, stubborn, taught by a hard life to have exactly the right skills she needs to survive the Games.  The scenes in the arena and later in battle outside the arena are viscerally real, and the narration in Katniss's first person present tense voice gives you no assurance that she will be around when the series ends, and that goes for Peeta and Gale and Prim and Haymitch and all the rest of your favorite characters, too. Taken simply as pure, breathtaking entertainment, these novels totally rock.<br /><br />Second, because Katniss is a girl, these novels are immensely empowering to women.  Not only does Katniss kick serious ass, she instinctively says and does the right thing when everything is on the line.  She's a role model I'd be happy for any girl to aspire to.  Or any woman, for that matter.  I love Harry Potter, I do, but it's always bugged me, just a little, that the books weren't about Hermione.  I know, I know, teachers and librarians say you can't get boys to read books about girls, but let me tell you, I've made grown men read these books and they can't put them down.  So maybe [[ASIN:0439023483 The Hunger Games]] books are the beginning of a paradigm shift in reading habits.  I so hope so.<br /><br />Thirdly, Collins has a message.  She puts these randomly selected kids into an arena to kill each other on a homicidal version of American Idol, all to serve as an annual object lesson that furthers the political stranglehold of the Capitol on the twelve Districts. By not flinching away from just how brutal those hand-to-hand deaths are, she puts us personally on the battlefield.  God, I can still see that spear going through Rue.<br /><br />How many Rues does the human race sacrifice before we figure out how to live with each other?  \\"I think Peeta was onto something,\\" Katniss says, \\"about us destroying one another and letting some decent species take over.\\"  Because really, I think Collins is saying, what is the alternative?  Children dying.<br /><br />The best science fiction is more than just a good story.  It holds up a mirror and shows us exactly who we are.  [[ASIN:0439023483 The Hunger Games]] trilogy is an exemplar of the \\"if this goes on\\" science fiction trope.<br /><br />I really like the ending, too, and not just because I was a Peeta girl from [[ASIN:0439023483 The Hunger Games]] on.  Again, Katniss did the right thing like she always does and took down the right person.  Her way back from everything that has happened to her is long and painful and very, very hard.  This isn't a happily ever after, and it shouldn't be.<br /><br />But, boy, is it a good read.esson that furthers the political stranglehold of the Capitol on the twelve Districts.

0439023513|2.0|Loved Book One...Book Two was decent but hated the cliff hanger at the end.    Book Three...I really felt there was not enough insight into the support characters or enough symbolism.  I really thought the mockingjay bird would be involved in at least one major event or rescue. There was not enough detail in the major events and what was going on in everyone's mind. Way to much on District Thirteen not enough on the capitol invasion.  Or it could have been two books..one on the events leading up to the final captitol invasion and district 13 and a the other focused on the capitol invasion.  I think you could have gotten alot more character and event development that way.  Didn't like what happened to Snow..to simple.  In fact I thought several main characters were offed too simply.  Didn't get how the relationship between Katniss and 'I won't say who' ended where it did.  Didn't need the 15 years later thing at the end.    There were some good points.  Loved the cat story line and the radio broadcast to distract the capitol during the rescue.  Liked the ProPro line in general.    but overall..incredibly disappointing ending to a great great beginning story.
0439023513|5.0|Katniss Everdeen, the girl on fire, the spark that started a revolution, once again finds her life in chaos. Rescued from the Quarter Quell and whisked to District 13 and the seat of the rebel cause, Katniss is expected to take up her role as the figurehead of the rebellion; as the Mockingjay so ready and willing to fight the Capitol. Peeta is captured. Probably dead--it would be best if he were dead. District 12 is gone. And Katniss finds she can no longer hide from the war she never meant to start.<br /><br />Many are willing, as ever, to tell Katniss what to do, who to support and what role to play. But before she can become the Mockingjay, before she can save Panem, her loved ones, or even herself, Katniss will have to decide what cost she is willing to pay for survival and, ultimately, for freedom in Mockingjay (2010) by Suzanne Collins.<br /><br />Mockingjay, the follow up to Collins' insanely popular books The Hunger Games and Catching Fire hardly needs an introduction or help getting into the hands of eager readers. This book, like the rest of the trilogy, sells itself.<br /><br />In the much anticipated conclusion to the trilogy, Collins does little to disappoint. Filled with twists, action, and memorable characters, Mockingjay will keep readers guessing (and riveted) until the very end.<br /><br />And what a finish.<br /><br />In a lot of ways Mockingjay was even more brutal than the other books about Katniss and Panem because Collins made it so clear that these characters are damaged beyond repair. Will they keep going? Of course. Will anyone be the same after the war is decided once and for all? Of course not.<br /><br />The writing is scattered and often bleak, likely because our heroine is repeatedly injured mentally and physically. Collins is brutally honest about what it has cost Katniss and many of the other characters (especially the other Victors of the Games) to make it this far while showing irrevocably that war rarely solves anything neatly and often hurts the very people it's trying to save. Still it's impossible to turn away from this modern, original story of a girl, a revolution, and a war that is fought as much on camera as on the front lines.<br /><br />Mockingjay remains a strong, compelling story about characters that have captured the world's imagination. Some reviews have suggested that the core characters were inconsistently written here or that the ending was lacking. On the contrary, Collins has not only been faithful to the spirit of the first two books but also created an utterly original conclusion to a powerful trilogy.<br /><br />I love all of the books as physical objects with the arresting designs by Elizabeth B. Parisi and cover art by Tim O'Brien. I love the energy from this series. I love the characters and the story. I find myself completely moved (and maybe even rattled) by this powerful, surprising, and ultimately appropriate ending to a series that has quite literally changed the face of young adult literature forever.<br /><br />Possible Pairings: Green Angel by Alice Hoffman, How I Live Now by Meg Rosoff.

B003LFLOOW|5.0|I was hesitant to watch this movie for some reason, but decided to rent it.  I am really happy I did.  I really liked the movie and loved all the vivid colors.  My favorite is the connection with the dragons.  I also really liked when the lead actor caught a ride on the dragon that no one else could capture.  I don't usually watch movies twice, but I may just watch this one again.
B001UV4XFQ|2.0|It is widely acknowledged that the 1st installment of the series, Twilight was the best.<br />The 2nd installment New Moon received a less favorable review.<br />I have heard this 3rd installment Eclipse was the most popular book among the 3<br />with mostly favorable review of the film (see other reviews).<br /><br />This review is based on the dvd version of Eclipse.<br /><br />We found the film unbearably boring, from beginning to end.<br />It's like a talkfest for the teens.<br />The 1st hour and half is mostly talk, talk, talk with intermittent short action sequences which<br />were poorly staged.<br />With such a popular and lucrative film franchise, why did the producer or filmmaker staged<br />the snow sequence with fake snow and in the studio with some CGI instead of<br />going to the real snow capped mountain?<br />The grand finale seemed like a repeat of one of the fight sequences in the open field<br />between the vampires and the wolves but without the urgency and power.<br />That highly expected crucial final sequence was again poorly staged without a hint of excitement.<br />The fault of this film lies with the scriptwriter and the director.  The actors are not to be blamed.<br />A major disappointment!
0066620996|3.0|I just re-read Good to Great by Jim Collins. I wanted to see if the same principles that applied to great companies in 2001 still applied today in the wake of the economic recession we are in. I actually found that they still do apply even though some of the companies, Circuit City and Fannie Mae, have not faired so well.<br /><br />A good sequel would be to look at all the companies profiled and see where they are 10 years later and in the case of Circuit City how did they go from Good to Great to Great to Gone. But there are still concepts that apply today just as much if not more than they did 10 years ago.<br /><br />One example is what he refers to as the Stockdale Paradox which came from an interview he had with Admiral Jim Stockdale who was POW in Vietnam for seven years. This principle kept him alive and is basically a way of dealing with lifes challenges. The paradox states that you must retain faith that you will prevail in the end AND at the same time you must confront the most brutal facts of your current reality.<br /><br />To the great companies it did not matter how bleak the situation was they all maintained faith they would survive in the end but at the same time they confronted the most facts of their current reality. Much more is said of this in Chapter 4. One more concept that I found interesting was in Chapter 5. He calls it the Hedgehog Concept and reading the chapter will give you a great understanding of why he calls it this but basically it is an understanding of what you can be the best at. It is not a goal to be the best, a strategy to be the best, or a plan but an understanding. You need to be the best at your core business.<br /><br />These are only two of the concepts but there are more and I feel they are still as relevant today as they were ten years ago. I would highly recommend reading this book for the first time or if you have not read it in a few years to read it again.
0439023521|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!  I have ordered the remaining of the series and can not wait to read them.  Highly recommended!!!!!
0920668372|4.0|Ok, so I read all the reviews mixed..My 4yr old loves it, it's basically a story explaining that no matter how old your child gets no matter what he does or where he is, you will always love him, she sings this sweet song to him when he's a baby, 2yrs old, 9 and teen i tbelieve(my son memorized it already).  however, what is a little odd is how when he moves away (grown man), she drives to his house, while he's asleep and cradles him (as she did all the previous times) and sings the same song..then once she's old/sick she calls him to tell him this(old/sick) and to he'd better come to see her(a little Marie from \\"Raymond\\"-the parts i dont like from the book), then he sings the song to her...then, the next page shows him with his own new baby and the man now sings the same song to him/her. So, very sweet ending..son doesn't soak in the whole oddity of the old/sick woman(i also downplayed it like \\"his mom was just a little sick so he went to see her and take care of her like she did him bec. he loves his mom just like his mom will always love him and i will always love you no matter how old you are.\\"  He's asked me to read it the last 3 nights.  So, just depends how you analyze it and read to your child.
0451208706|5.0|First of all, Ken Follett is a favorite author of mine and I had sort of gotten away from reading his work.  When I stumbled upon some of his books I was very interested in reading them.  I ordered this book and was very happy with the description which was correct regarding the condition.  The book came within the timeframe stated and I have been happily reading ever since I got it.
1416955070|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read, and I'm pretty picky. The only thing that bothers people is that it touches on some themes that some people find disturbing. I say get a gut or don't read it. it's really good and if you like fantasy books, give this a try :)
0439023513|5.0|I loved this nook beginning to end. I think it was a great ending to the series. I could not put it down from the day I got it.   I love the way Suzanne Collins throws you into the world or panem from the get go. She doesn't spend her time explaining the characters in the beginning and then tell the story. She let's the story tell you who the characters are, their thoughts, feelings , and history.   This is one book I hope they never make into a movie. I think it would ruin the world everyone has created in their head. From the characters and the blood bath that is the games, and the war. This isn't a pretty book, or series for that matter. This isn't twilight with a lot or romance thrown in with a little conflict. This is a war, with a budding romance.   It's a story of one teenage girl, faced with struggles nobody that age could never magine going through.  Praises for Collins and her amazing series.
0307454541|5.0|This is a great read!! I admit, when I first started it I had a hard time catching on. I kept thinking- what's the big deal? It does take a little while to get into, but then you won't be able to put it down.
B003QZ5222|4.0|If you're like me, and your Springsteen collection is a ragtag bunch of scratched old LP's, and you didn't really become a fan until Born in the USA, so your missing a few early albums, then this collection is for you. The price is incredible and you get all of the albums from the most important part of Bruce's career. Just don't expect anything great in the packaging department. It's basically just the CD's packaged in slim envelopes that look like someone photocopied and shrunk the album covers to fit.But I've put the CD's onto my iPod, and there they'll stay.
0439023513|4.0|I must admit compared with the first two, Mockingjay was not perhaps as good, but then again what it lacks in some regards it gains in others. It presents the reader with many hard truths at once. Both the horrors and need for war. It doesn't just say fight for what you believe in but understand that that fighting will come with cost. It explores the human tragedy that befalls the fallout of war, from the loss of friends to the reality that in the end, it seems everyone is just as expendable as the next. It explores the concept of power, how one gets it, and how one uses it, and how even those with the most power are still can be pawns in a larger game. It explores the cost to the human soul, when one is forced to face the difficulties that come with taking life.    Overall, I feel that this the final book, brought a sufficient end to the hunger games. And, I am very satisfied to have made that decision several months ago to try out a new series based on glowing reviews. I may not always read science fiction but this is one book series that I would recommend to anyone young and old alike.
B0000025T6|5.0|Sometime in the 2000´s Uncut magazine once devoted the cover and the main story to Bruce and the making of this album. As noted in other reviews, this album was recorded at home on a cassette using a 4-track machine (apparently in a single, 4 hour session including two other songs that would appear in BitUSA) and the intention was that this recording would serve as a demo to later record full band versions of the songs. The songs got the full-band treatment but Bruce and Jon Landau agreed that the tape had a special feeling to it that got lost in the newer versions and in a very brave move they decided to release the original versions, hence the particular sound of this album that IMHO conveys very well the intentions and meaning of the songs. A note on the sound: a few years after it´s original release, while mastering the CD version of the album, the engineer in charge found big challenges given the very low level and high hiss of the original tape so this is one example of an album that NEEDS to be heard on vinyl.     Reading a local business oriented newspaper in 2002 I came across a review of this album by their music critic, he began by saying: \\"Nebraska, one or rock´s perfect albums...\\". In a sense I agree, it is rock and roll, the stories have an universal appeal and it´s sound make it ageless.
0307592839|4.0|hey, i liked it. that's all you can ask from a book.     lots of people say 'it's over-hyped, literati hot air' but it's not, if by a minimal margin. there's some silliness, like the chapter made of powerpoint slides, but it moves fast and has some intrigue, if not a lot. besides that, the far-reaching intention to meld chapters all voiced by different characters into one 'novel' is successful. it's not like a book of short stories by say, alice munro, where time and plot sprawl beyond linear plot cohesion, even it's mostly the same characters.     so, give it a shot. the worst i can say is that the prose sounds like the narration from 'stranger than fiction'. a bit self-absorbed, but still a good read.
B000NU2CY4|1.0|This Review is for the Blu-Ray Quality Transfer: I would imagine the guy responsable for the quality control on this project no longer has a job . Trust me out of my 400 Blu-Ray Titles I have bought this is running at 2nd from the bottom,I love this movie but I could not bear to watch it on my 20K HT ,was like watching TV with bad reception. Exstremly disapointing
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I was so excited to get this knife.  I looked over a lot of knifes, did a lot of research.  A video of a guy batonning wood piqued my interest, but I saw a guy at a knife show with this knife with a para-chord handle and a custom leather sheath. I knew this was the one survival knife I wanted.     I was not let down.  The sheath is pretty cool and so is the built in pummel.  the sheath is nice and very secure.  It would probably wear out with a years hard use, but it is very good for now.  I'm thinking a custom leather sheath is in order for this classic knife.  If I was only allowed one knife this is it.  If I was allowed two knives, I would take this and a Buck Ergomaster.  I think that would be a better knife for skinning a deer. This could do the job, but the handle is a little bulky. If I removed the handle it would probably be a pretty descent skinning knife.    Buy it if you have any doubt.  You won't regret having this knife in your kit.
0307454541|5.0|Gripping story, but the names of family members and the whole family history can be a real drag sometimes.  But, this is a very compelling story, I can't put it down...I don't often read much, but this has changed my habbits.  I bought the whole trilogy and I'm sure I won't be sorry!
0553274503|5.0|By the end of this very emotional novel, I was in tears. I learned so much about human nature and how everyone should respect each other. Although it was fiction, Daniel Keyes made the story of Charlie Gordon seem so real and the emotions of every character so raw. I would definitely recommend this book to teenagers and adults, who should all be ready with a tissue box nearby.
B002ZG981E|4.0|This movie showcases the true talent Christopher Nolan posses. He wrote AND directed this movie which I find just amazing. The script was good and the story is mind bottling :) That being said, the movie is confusing and full of minor goofs. If you don't believe me, look at what IMDB has to say: [[...]] The movie was enjoyable and for once in a long time I feel I need to see it again. Highly recommended.
B00003IQN1|5.0|While this was the best sounding version at the turn of the 00's (purportedly 24-bit remaster, along with all the other McCartney mini-LP CD Japan releases), it does not rise to the level of the DVD remastered WOA tracks on \\"The McCartney Years\\", Vol 1. Rhino box set (3 DVDs, now OUT-OF-PRINT).  While you don't get the entire concert, you do get remastered audio and video of multiple WOA tracks - it is the pinnacle in sound and visual for this title.  McCartney on Rhino?  After all those year with Capitol and EMI?  Sounds funny, but, YES!  For those who are tech savvy, you can always pull down the DVD audio to your MP3 or CD.  You can still find the boxset for around $25 (but not much longer).  WOA 3-CD Japanese release...about $200 (circa 2010).  Look for this price to drop substantially when Hear Music releases their remaster of WOA!
B002VECMAO|5.0|I was reading the 1 star reviews and I couldn't believe what I was seeing. This movie is awesome. I laughed the entire time and I found it very enjoyable. You will definitely like this movie if you enjoyed the Ocean's trilogy or movies like The Informant. Awesome script, awesome acting, awesome cast, need I say more?
B002ZG9846|1.0|Rating Worthless    It seems lately that every year there are a handful of films that just the right amount of people tout as being a truly great and original piece of cinema. Let the Right One In, the Wrestler & Adventureland immediately come to mind but at least those films warrant, save for Adventureland which only gets *, a worth seeing (**) rating whereas the newest addition to this list, 2010's Kick-Ass, doesn't even measure up the good deal of mediocrity found in those several films.    Based on a comic I've never read, or had ever even heard of, and have no interest in pursuing, I decided to check this out solely to say that I'd seen it. I went in with no expectations, which was a wise choice, because I feel as if I had gone into this with some kind of expectations, oh I don't know a few laughs and some interesting ideas, the failure to meet them would have ended up wholely immeasurable.    Aaron Johnson plays the title character, who makes a point to let us know that people like Spider-Man and Superman could never actually exist in real life (a statement as eye opening as the entry level philosophical ideas at play in David Fincher's equally useless film Fight Club.) and that he's just a regular teenager who possesses no luck with the ladies and spends the vast majority of his time watching TV, reading comics and jerking off (oh, strained reltability, how awkward and annoying you are.) The film wants to be something more than just another movie based on a comic, it wants to be the anti-super hero super hero film by injecting lots of realistic cynicism and black humor, but all of these attempts fall as flat on their face as the character in the opening shot who under the impression that his homemade wings will allow him to fly from the top of a skyscraper dies after crashing onto the roof of a car parked below.    Eventually Kick-Ass, AKA Dave, finds out that he's not the only person in his city willing to wear an outfit and fight crime, there's a father anddaughter team who are dedicated to eradicating everyone involved in the local mega-crime boss' syndicate. Roger Ebert lost his marbles over the film BECAUSEthe daughter in the team is a pre-teen, or 13 or something, and she delights in heavy weaponry, flowing profanity and expert headshots. Morally irresponsible he cried; painfully boring and trying way too hard cries I. There could be read the implications by the creator of the comic and the director of the film that the father in the team is beyond psychologically warped because he's brainwashed his daughter to become the NRA's wildest dream, a mini-Dirty Harry who dispenses of human life without a moment's thought or hesitation because they're the \\"bad guys\\", but that isnt' it, this is just a stupid little film without a single redeemable quality.    Vastly inferior to Jody Hill's 2009 misunderstood near-masterpiece Observe and Report; a black comedy with numerous interesting qualities.
B001PR0YGC|5.0|This is an awesome movie, I can't believe the amount of poor reviews it is getting. If you haven't seen it, give it a try. The script is amazing. I enjoyed the movie so much I had to see if it was available on Blu-ray. Matt Damon does an awesome job and the twist at the end is as mind blowing as Inception.
B000WCN8SC|5.0|If you even like The Doors, this is an amazing product.  I wish more well known artists released sets like this.  I even had the Mobile Fidelity gold version of two of these CDs and this set blows them away.  I heard things repeatedly on these discs that I have never heard before in these recordings.  Why can't The Beatles do something worthwhile like this?
B001OQCV2O|5.0|I thought this was going to be some docu-drama about the Mayan proposed end of the earth in 2012 but it was way more fun and exiting than I had expected. I couldn't believe the amount of bad reviews this movie is getting because I really enjoyed it. The other reviews are like something my dad would say, \\"Planes can't do that. or People don't act like that\\". Enjoy the movie the way it is, don't expect to be blown away. I enjoyed the plot and story and Woody Harrelson was awesome. One last thing, the special effects really were amazing, I never thought anything looked green-screened so this was an edge-of-your-seat nail-biter for me.
0439023513|5.0|I will start by saying that I enjoyed this book.  I rapidly went through the first two and eagerly awaited the last installment. Wow! this was an violent and emotional journey.      It's been a few days sense I completed the book and the characters are still resonating with me.  Good job Ms. Collins.    The violence (in all three) was difficult at times but yet I was continously captivated by the storyline.      I also find it interesting that this book series is for Young Adults.  I'm 41 and I would only allow someone over the age of 17 to read these books.  What constitutes a YA book; that main characters are between 12 and 17?  Is that the only standard.  I felt the same way about the Twillight Series. Never the less, I enjoyed the books.    I definitely think these books are going to make great movies but I'm not sure how they will keep it PG-13.
B00275EGX8|1.0|Movie sucked, completely unbelievable. I apologize to our troops for the obvious ignorance of some American citizens. Characters were poorly put together as was the script. Special effects weren't even believable. In one scene, a car is supposed to explode from a bunch of explosives that are packed in throughout. Instead, the explosion looks like someone doused the car was doused with gasoline and had a match thrown at it. Don't waste your time...
B003JTHETY|5.0|Just picked the new MAIDEN up a couple days ago.  The first time I played it I was thinking, its alright.  A few playes later and I cant stop listening to it.  I am definately surprised by the bad reviews.  These guys have been kicking a@@ since the 80's.  The last song on the album \\"where the wild wind blows\\" is definately my favorite track.  If you are a Maiden fan pick this one up.
B002UNMW7O|1.0|Boondock Saints was an awesome movie and it ranks among the best in my opinion. This was a disaster. I agree with some of the other reviewers about the girl who replaced Willem Dafoe being horrible. I thought Rita from Dexter would have done a better job. She wasn't the only problem with this movie. It was nothing like the first and most of the original characters from the first are gone. Save your time and money, avoid this movie. I actually use it now more than the Matrix when I need to refer to a movie with bad sequels.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Love, love, love it! the DVDs were in perfect condition! Needless to say I'm now hooked on True Blood!
B0018QCXH8|2.0|Daniel Day Lewis is one of the greatest actors of all time. Unfortunately, this movie isn't as good. My problems with this movie were the script and story. Not only did it not make sense, the plot is best described as awkward and depressing. The guy who plays the young preacher shouldn't be in acting, I can't stand him. I am willing to watch this movie again because I feel there may be more to the story than I give it credit for. That is why I give it 2 stars. I would recommend renting over buying.
B001GCUO5W|5.0|Many people will find Shutter Island perplexing and dissatisfying, because the plot structure breaks down in the middle of the film, so you should not go to it with normal expectations of plot and entertainment. It is an exploration into mental illness, and makes the attempt to tackle this from the interior perspective of a deeply troubled shitzophrenic, taking you on their journey and tracking the impact of the illness as medication wears off and delusions and fantasies become more intense. I remember someone once telling me about a similar situation, that these types of mental illness render the sufferer unable to create a cohesive explanation of their life story, and this is masterfully depicted here. For those who have lived with this kind of illness, the film will be fascinating, wonderful, deeply moving and, given its intelligence, its closing question will leave you troubled. Few films have challenged me to this degree (one thinks of Eyes Wide Shut, for example).   It's a pleasure, also, that Martin Scorsese has moved beyond the awful bad language and mundane crime plots of his recent ventures to apply his immense talents to such a worthwhile field. The film has no swearing or sex, but it is definitely for adults only.
0783225733|4.0|The trip, not the movie. I don't know how the crew managed to do it. Even knowing they did make it back alive, I was really tense when the re-entry scene was playing. This movie is a must for anyone interested in the history of the moon program.
1416955070|5.0|Cassandra Clare is becoming one of my favorite authors. I couldn't get enough! I didn't want to stop reading the series. I love her writing style and I felt like I could relate to the characters. It's romantic and funny. I would definately recommend it.
0316776963|3.0|This book is like one of those comedians you see on TV that you think is funny enough to channel squat around, but you don't remember a single joke s/he told in a week.  The routine is publishable, doesn't stick in the mind, and would be 'meh' if you saw it a second time.  That's how I feel about this book.  It's amusing, but ultimately lacking substance.    I thought the funniest parts were about Dave's sister Amy and not about Dave.  Dave comes on strong with opinions, though they are couched in wit, and I didn't always agree.  Maybe I saw the cynicism behind the humor?  This soured the good mood the book creates.    This is a great book to borrow from a library, but not a good book to own unless you find it hilarious.  For me, it's not a re-reader, thus three stars.  I enjoyed it while reading, but I would not enjoy reading it again.
0375842209|5.0|This book is a must read for ages 13 to 100.  The perspective of death as the narrator, and the innocence and bravery of Leisel, the main character, will leave lasting memories of joy in spite of the destruction in the small Nazi-German village.  The neighbor boy, Rudy, will burn a hole in your heart with his bravery and spirit...the characters will live on in your heart.  Read it and rejoice in the great human spirit that thrives where there is love.      I think of the images and events, and they fill my soul.  Enjoy, and be sure to watch the video of Markus Zusak giving a book talk in Australia.  The part he tells about his family, when they were painting houses, and it was time to break the eggs for lunch.  Well worth the google search.  (It illustrates Zusak's rich writing style and his sense of humor).
0439023513|5.0|Whenever I am reading a trilogy, I always have the fear that the last book will be terrible and all that time spent building up to the end will fall flat.  This was NOT the case in this trilogy.  The writing was amazing, the plot twists were always unexpected and the characters were well developed.  I'm a 30 something, and don't read a lot of YA, however I found this book more engaging that most of the books I read. I found myself thinking about the story and the characters long after I finished each book.  Althought I bought the kindle edition, I will be ordering the hardback to share with friends and family.  It's just that good!
0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay starts out a slow burner, even clunky at times, but gathers speed and barrels toward a finish that earns every gasp, tear, and exclamation along the way. Every character is who they've always been, reasonably changed by their experiences, but Collins never stoops to character assassination or cheap pulpy gimmicks to resolve the triangle she has created between Peeta, Katniss, and Gale. What's more, said triangle is inextricably intertwined with the Rebels' efforts to overthrow the Capitol of Panem.       Collins has crafted a finale worthy of her trilogy. I was going to give it a four due to the laborious start, but the last half bumped it up to a five. With Collins' fearless style and respect for her readers the novel transcends the high-school romance centered YA fare of recent memory. The conclusion feels inevitable, earned, paid for in blood and tears, but not expected. Both the politics and relationships are done justice, and it leaves plenty to chew on long after the last page is read.
0439023513|5.0|This was a great book, I finished it accidentally in one day! I didn't mean too, I simply couldn't put it down. This book is different than the other two, it definitely has a dark side that seems to ring true about how cruel people and war can be. How events change you forever and can leave you shattered. After the last book I really thought that Katniss would simply pick up where she left off, rescuing Peeta, choosing between him and Gale, and saving the world while being blissfully in love. I love that it kept me guessing. It definitely didn't disappoint
0439023513|3.0|As were other readers, I was disappointed and let down by this book, the final installment in the previously thrilling Hunger Games trilogy. I had really anticipated liking it more. I think the main point fueling my reaction is that the interaction and the dialog between the individuals and the interplay of their relationships that I had found so interesting in the first two novels were missing in this one. By the end, I really didn't care about any of the formerly endearing or revolting characters and got tired of the endless descriptions of weapons and all different manner of war and death. I prefer to read about people and their feelings and thoughts to reading about battles, chases, and escapes from the clutches of bad guys or fantastic hordes of killing machines.<br /><br />I really didn't have much empathy for Katniss because she seemed to always  be either impetuously disregarding what was in her best interests and doing something stupid out of anger or revenge or huddled in a secret place crying and wallowing. Neither is attractive in a character I want to admire and root for in a novel that is supposed to be about strong heroines and causes.  I guess I felt that the novel was relentless in its diatribe about the horrors of war - got it the first time in the first chapter.  I had hoped that Katniss would lead the rebels to the Capitol in an organized well thought out battle where GOOD would decisively triumph over evil. By the time she made it to the Capitol, her motives seemed shallow and more for personal reasons than for the good of Panem as a whole - it was about her and what Snow had done to her loved ones and her life. More or less it seemed to me that, in the end, she whimpered toward a victory that was hollow and pointless as she slunk back to District 12 to quietly live out the rest of her days. The epilogue was supposed to indicate that she had reached a level of peace or acceptance but merely seemed like an afterthought. She had completely lost her passion.  And I lost interest in her.<br /><br />Despite my overall dissatisfaction and my review indicating that to me the book was only so-so, anyone who was enthralled with [[ASIN:0439023483 The Hunger Games]] and [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]] will certainly feel compelled to read this book to finish out the series.

B002QW7ALM|4.0|Pandorum,released Sept/09,gives us an interesting and different twist in the Sci-Fi genre.The cast is generally confined to a few people at a time on screen and the film manages to capture and maintain an all-pervading atmosphere of oppression and danger,throughout its run.<br />The story is set in 2247 and the Earth has gone to hell in a hand basket.It has sent a large spaceship full of new colonists(some 16,000 souls)to an Earth-like world some 40 light years away called Tanis,to resettle and populate.However something has gone terribly wrong during the flight.A Corp.Bower awakens from hyper sleep to find that he is seemingly alone on the ship the Elysium,in an ante room cut off from the ships bridge.Just as he regains some of his senses another stasis tube opens and out is ejected one Lieut.Payton.He is as confused as Bower due to their extended hyper sleep and they come to the conclusion that they must regain access to the bridge in order to fully reassess their situation,whatever it is.<br />Bower elects to crawl through the above duct work in order to hopefully reach the bridge.However his claustrophobic antics in the ducts send him crashing to a grate,through that and then onto the floor;not on the bridge as he'd hoped.As he inspects his surroundings he comes upon a body suspended by a wire in a long hall way.The person is alive but he is no mood to help Bower and in short order Bower discovers there is more life on the ship than this man and the lieutenant;and it is quite malevolent.They hide but Bowers new \\"find\\" is dragged away to his death by the creatures;humanoid beings that run and crawl with amazing speed and wear an exoskeleton of bones.<br />The farther Bower explores the ship the more creatures he encounters.In fact he manages to hook up with two other crew members along the way,a man(who speaks no English)and a woman;both are just as bewildered and terrified of their surroundings as Bower.Pieces of this mysterious puzzle slowly start to come together as the film progresses and we learn that these wild creatures roaming the ship were once humans like themselves.It seems that some genetic enhancement in their cryo-tube feeder lines which was supposed to help kick start life on the new planet has somehow mutated many of the colonist.Bower's memory also slowly returns to him bit by bit and he realizes that the reactor must be restarted in order to gain control of the ship properly.With this in mind he heads down to the lowest and most dangerous levels of the ship to reach it with his companions.<br />Lieut.Payton meanwhile has had his hands full.A young corporal has come out of a cryo pod in Bowers absence and the corporal has all the signs of pandorum;a slow build up of extreme paranoia which can lead to severe harm to those around.As he deals with the corporal he tries to guide Bower and company to the reactor.Things however deteriorate to such an extent he is over powered and forced by the corporal to eject him off the ship in a life pod.But it is only a simulation run by the lieutenant and in there the corporal stays temporarily.Back at the reactor things are touch and go.The resting area for the blood thirsty creatures is at the base of the reactor.The walkway above which leads to the reactor controls gives way under Bowers feet and he falls to another extending section of the reactor.However he must go down and walk through the creatures while they rest/sleep and climb the ladder back up to the controls.Just as he reaches the ladder the creatures wake up and pursue Bower and company.Bower manages to finally get the reactor online which disintegrates many of the creatures at its base.However it is still a mad dash back to the bridge and \\"safety\\" from those creatures still alive,and there are plenty.<br />The corporal that Lieut.Payton held in the pod is now out again and they are in a hand to hand struggle.Payton manages to subdue him with a tranquilizer gun,but wait.The corporal IS the lieutenant!He,suffering from pandorum himself,was responsible for ejecting around 1600 passengers early on in the flight.He re-entered a cryo sleep until awakened later to meet an unsuspecting Bower.Now Bower and the only one of two of his companions left,confront Payton.Payton opens the shield doors from the observation windows above to reveal an inky blackness with no stars.When an alien life form swims by the windows illuminating some of the surroundings,it is then they realize they are under water.The Elysium had crash landed underwater 923 years before.When a crack in the window forms during their struggle with Payton and water starts to enter,Bower and his companion enter a cryo tube and eject themselves.In short order what colonists that are left on board are also being ejected because of the hull breach.They all end up on the water surface looking across at a beautiful island with a waterfall;just waiting for them to finally begin their colonization of Tanis.<br />The film moves back and forth between Payton and Bowers at just the right moments.Besides the creatures,there are rarely any more than three people on the screen at one time.The claustrophobia is maintained beautifully throughout and is heightened considerably in such areas as the duct work,full of round tubing that is unforgiving and almost seems alive.The big picture as to exactly what is going on is also kept to a minimum throughout.The characters and we the viewers are kept in the dark and only given enough snippets to pique our interest just to keep things moving at the pace the director wants.So when we finally realize that the corporal and the lieutenant are one and the same and the ship is actually under water and not lost in space,the punch is considerable.Well crafted to be sure and it is what makes Pandorum the good movie it is.<br />Technically the film is in its' widescreen glory in its 2:35:1 a/r.The transfer is clear and crisp.Special features include three featurettes,one a behind-the-scenes,a mock flight team video for the Elysium and a Blair Witch-like video of what happened to Nadia's team.There is also the trailer,commentary and some deleted and alternate scenes.The DVD I have comes with a holographic like cover over the usual snap case.Nice.<br />All in all a different,likable and smart twist in the Sci Fi genre.The oppressive atmosphere the makers maintain throughout the film is wonderfully done and they leave you guessing right down to the final moments.I recommend it.mself,was

B000O179FO|2.0|The editors of this film should be shot. No shot lasts more than 3 seconds. On a big screen tv it's dizzing. It's too bad since the film on a whole is a pretty good film, and the music is pretty great. But the film is ruined by fast cutting and quick shots - was the editing team on speed???????? Why do they think this is the way to edit a musical? If you become aware of the editing while you're watching a film, then the editors have done a bad job. Hire editors who know how to edit a film, skip the Blu-ray and by the CD.
0545140315|4.0|I ordered this book because my favorite author recommended it. I wasn't dissappointed in the story, but I was a little let down with the language.     It is a tale about a young woman (Penny Lane) who has imagined her whole life as being a partner with a certain young man. They've known each other since they were in diapers, and now that they are both Juniors in high-school they are looking at each other more as romantic partners, and (for her) possible marriage material. After he acts like the typical teenage boy and thinks more with his hormones than his heart/brain she vows to not date anymore boys in high-school and always put herself and her friends first. She, being a life-long Beatles fanatic (thanks to her obsessed parents), starts a \\"Lonely Hearts Club.\\" She is originally the only member, but as her friends start to see the heart-breaking ways of boys and the wisdom of Penny Lane the club grows to include 30 long term members of all levels in high-school. They learn alot about each other and themselves. Dreams are realized, identities formed, friendships made and strengthened and lessons learned. In the end Penny Lane and her Lonely Hearts Club realize that caring about yourself and your friends is vitally important, but also that some boys are worth taking a chance on.    It was a really cute story, and with some editing (on my part) to take the curse words out, a really good book. Reminds me of high school; and it was fun to read all the Beatles references. I'd recommend it.

0425200469|5.0|About a decade ago, when I was in high school, I went through an Agatha Christie stage, but I hadn't read another of her novels again until this summer. But something clicked this summer. I guess I was looking for some of the surety--in the face of human tragedy--that comes out in Christie's plots, the way some sort of cosmos assembles itself out of chaos. Anyway, I read one, and then another, and eventually devoured a dozen or so novels that I'd missed.     I especially focused on the mini-canon of novels that are considered to be Christie's best. Among these, I would say with little doubt (The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is still a favorite) that Death on the Nile is my favorite. It offers everything that is best about the Dame's novels. With this setting, as a traveling party journeys down the Nile, she has created an exotic and volatile atmosphere. The cast of characters is compellingly written, an eccentric bunch, each of whom is driven by a complex set of motives. In truth, Death on the Nile seems to me to possess one of Christie's most cogent examinations of human foibles. The prose is especially crisp and the novel's pace is fast. Christie moves deftly between moments of action, romance, mystery, and humor.     And added to this, Poirot is at the top of his game. He is at his most compassionate and humane. Moreover, the plot to the novel is especially plausible and complex, and Poirot performs his special magic in tying all of the pieces together.    All-in-all, it's a tremendously satisfying read, containing all of the components of the typical Christie novel, with those elements written at the highest quality. This is certainly one of, if not, Christie's best.
0446679089|1.0|Just finished Plum Island, which I bought (cheap) when I thought I maybe had West Nile Virus some weeks ago, and Lab 257 at Plum Island is quite possibly where that disease came from (in the US anyway; see [[ASIN:006078184X Lab 257: The Disturbing Story of the Government's Secret Germ Laboratory]]. However, the germ lab is one gigantic MacGuffin, its actual work playing at best a marginal role in this novel. Plus, the main character is a boorish and boring macho pig who tells jokes like: Q: What's the difference between a woman and a computer? A: A woman won't accept a three-and-a-half inch floppy. At best, a thorough waste of time.

0143116177|4.0|This is a great primer for a lay person who wants to get a basic understanding of how markets work, and for those to get a historical perspective on some of the major causes of the current crises in global financial markets.  The author walks the reader through a brief but well documented history of currencies, banking, equities, bonds insurance, and government intervention (i.e. social programs, disaster aid, bailouts, etc.), then ties it all back to the current situation in a way that has relevance to what is going on today.<br /><br />After recently reading This Time It's Different, I found Mr. Ferguson's style of writing rather engaging, as if I were seeing the threads of a novel come together to a logical conclusion. Carmen and Rogoff's work would be an excellent follow-up to this book if you're actually interested in seeing what happens during and after each type of financial crisis (external default, domestic default, banking crises, currency crashes, and inflation outbursts), but this book gives the reader a push in the right direction.<br /><br />While readers who want a quick overview of the subject matter will probably leave feeling satisfied, I'm betting a good many others will find their appetite for the subject matter whetted.  And that, in my opinion, is what a good author does - they encourage you to keep thinking, long after you put the book down.

Assuming you know how to work with Excel, this book will greatly help you get a start on VBA for Excel. This book doesn't cover the kind of topics you would find in the Power Programming in Excel VBA book, but it covers really basic topics for a beginner.    If you're a beginner to Excel VBA, I would highly recommend this book as a starting point for learning to master it.

B0001ZX0OW|5.0|This film opens with three young boys playing hockey in the middle of the street in a Boston working-class neighborhood. One of the boys is abducted and viciously molested. It then shifts to the present day; the three boys are now grown men, approaching middle age.    The great Clint Eastwood directed the film. He had highly talented actors to work with in the roles of the three men: Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon. The murder of Penn's daughter is the central mystery of the film. Bacon is the BPD detective who leads the murder investigation. Robbins is the molestation victim who is still very much haunted by this childhood trauma. All three actors immersed themselves in their roles and are brilliant.    The film is about trust and betrayal. It's about self-doubt. It's about how things are not what they seem. It's about how nobody ever forgets anything.    Although this production easily earns five stars, it is overlong. A lot could have been edited out. Ironically, however, despite the slow pace, there should have been more character development of the three men's wives, who play a pivotal role.

B003ITZBW2|5.0|Under the Red Hood was an excellent DC release.  I am a huge fan of the animated releases that have been coming out for the past couple of years from both DC and Marvel.  I liked the fact the movie showed depth in each of the main characters.  Also, the appearance of Nightwing was an added bonus.  I always like when the storytellers include a blast from the past.  I am not really a big comic book fan, but I am a huge fan of the animated series.  Batman has been kicking some serios butt for decades now and showed no signs of slowing up in this movie.  The Joker was as psychotic as always.  I loved it.  It was great to see appearances from Amazzo and Black Mask.  The bonus disc did not disappoint.  I loved the Jonah Hex short movie.  Hopefully a full length feature film will be released sometime in the near future.  Excellent movie DC!

0596805888|5.0|Jerry Pournelle has already given this a \\"book of the month\\" award in his \\"Chaos Manor Reviews\\" (subscription access only), which is always a good recommendation.  I'm going to be embarrassed if I find that he actually finished reading the whole book that much sooner than I did, as there are more words in the book than I expected.  Some of those words refer to an earlier publication (among many references) by Hervé This, Molecular Gastronomy, Exploring the Science of Flavor, that I have also read.   Potter's explanations are much easier to follow and his text flows better; plus there are some random bits of humor thrown in, all the better for being unexpected.    Once you get the concepts under your belt Potter encourages experimentation and provides a scattering of examples to try.  A few of the suggestions seemed enough of a stretch that I began to question my level of geekness, but I will survive.  He includes a wide variety of sources for additional information including a number of internet references.  I like references a lot, although I'm a bit concerned whether the links provided will remain viable for the length of time that I now intend to keep this book on my shelf.    I enjoyed the book quite a lot, but it was on page 367  that I found some really pertinent information about mushrooms that, for me, is nearly worth the price of the book - you'll have to see for yourself what that is.
0321701763|2.0|I am an advanced photographer and have used Photoshop for years. This is the third edition of Classroom in a book for me and I was disappointed. The authors used several of the same old photos. Worse from my viewpoint is that several of the lessons were quite complex with no explanation of the reason for each of the steps. It is like a cookbook which is only useful for making the included recipes but not for learning how to cook. I think the Scott Kelby books are much more useful (and fun). Even the Martin Evening books which I don't like because the print is too small for my tired old eyes and can be rather dry are better than this effort.    Maybe a designer would find the book more useful but in my opinion Photographers should avoid it.
B00001XT76|5.0|I was so excited to receive my \\"Dirty Dancing\\" DVD. It arrived earlier than I had anticipated. The product came in mint condition. I would recommend buying from this vendor.
0596806027|2.0|This book feels like it was rushed to try to be the first HTML5 book published, the others I have ordered have all been pushed back several times as the specs/APIs evolve, this book was released as-is and it sure feels it. The 'Complete Examples' throughout the book are a mess and require considerable more work to be used as complete examples, they are at best snippets which illustrate very little. Several of the topics I was most interested in reading about were dealt with sparsely (some just in a single paragraph). In short, for an O'Reilley book I am quite disappointed.
B002HHGE9K|2.0|OK, I have this double CD when it came out in the late 90's. The sound then was awful for a professional recording. Honestly, this doesn't even sound like a multi-track recording!  I mean, compare this album to the How the West Was One job by Led Zeppelin. The sound quality is like night and day!<br /><br />This ELP album is truly a sad affair given how extraordinaire the music is. Why doesn't this recording sound like a multi-track recording???  Will someone please ping me and explain???  This sounds like a substandard soundboard, not even multi-track!<br /><br />The guy who reviewed this ahead of me doesn't have a CLUE as to what a multi-track recording must sound like if he gives this recording and remastering job a thumb's up. Save your money. This so-called \\"deluxe edition\\" has NOTHING new on it, no additional tracks, and ZERO improved sound quality. I could not detect any improvement from this recording when compared to the original recording. This recording is supposedly re-mastered by Andy Pearce for Sanctuary Records.<br /><br />Well, the folks at Sanctuary don't know SQUAT when it comes to remastering!  These are not multi-track tapes and it's a substandard soundboard recording. What a shame. I love ELP and I'm sure for millions of fans the world over, this particular series of performances are indeed very special. It's a damn shame that the legacy we have of this concert tour is so poor quality.<br /><br />I'm extremely disappointed with this so called \\"Deluxe edition\\" and I want my money back!
0307278255|3.0|I very much enjoyed The Namesake and this short story collection starts out strong. The first story, about the father and daughter is an understated jewel of emotion and things left unsaid. The story of the sister and her alcoholic brother seems real and jolting. Then the story of the intercultural couple starts getting a bit mushy. Around the middle, the story of Paul and \\"Sang\\" is just horrible! It's like one of those Saturday Night Live skits where the writers have no idea how to end it so they just go on and on ad nauseum until it fizzles out. It's hard to believe actually that it's the same writer who wrote the tightly crafted first story.    I'm about ready to give up on this collection but I've heard good things about the last trio of loosely connected stories so perhaps I'll tough it out. But I expected better from a talented author like Lahiri. A lot of readers have mentioned that she should write about other than Bengalis. But think about it: white authors write mostly about white people, Chinese about Chinese experience, etc. But I do agree that her Bengalis should be other than academics living mainly around Boston, as that is getting rather old.
0439023513|5.0|I'll spare a general summary, and cut to the chase: I devoured this book (really, I devoured the whole trilogy), and when I first closed this final book, I felt conflicted.  It didn't end the way I expected it to (honestly, for a while there nearing the end, I was worried there was going to be a surprise follow-up book, since the number of pages was growing smaller, and things weren't wrapping up the way I expected them to).  But what fun's a book if it does everything you expect?    I feel that the constant twists of expectations is really what I enjoyed about this book (and trilogy as a whole).  It played with my expectations and I think in doing so it was realistic (things don't always go the way we want them to), and it showed multiple sides of Katniss (yes, she does eventually get with Peeta and have children -- and I think that it shows how she changes over time, she doesn't remain exactly the way she is at the end of the war).  In the end, it doesn't seem like a sappy wrap-this-up-neatly epilogue, but a realistic one.  It, in a way, tempers the horror of war to have a hopeful yet not superficial epilogue that takes place after a significant amount of time has passed and adulthood has entered for the main characters.  It takes time to heal wounds, but there is healing, of a sort.  I'm very glad that it *didn't* end with a bounding leap right back into Katniss/Peeta romance, but rather small, small steps to a relationship that clearly took time to build back up, etc.      Yes, a lot of time is spent in the book with Katniss waking up in a hospital bed, with things going on around her -- but I think this is an excellent way to show just how much of a piece she is in a larger game.  Things happen to her and around her, rather than her instigating them a good deal of the time.  It's a good metaphor for her being a not-entirely-active participant in the greater picture since she's really everyone's pawn.  It worked for me.    I'm more than satisfied.  I enjoyed that she's a bold female protagonist with realistic and interesting flaws, and who ultimately makes mistakes, and isn't simply the Standard Feisty Heroine.  Katniss to me is a very real and convincing character with multiple layers.      The first two books were outstanding, and this final act is no exception.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time! Grace is a deep and believable character, and Sam is not your typical breath-taking hero with whom the heroine falls immediately in love with. Sam has a deep and problematic past, and Grace has a real connection with him. Usually not one to fall for the \\"soul mates\\" thing, I was surprised when I couldn't put this book down from the start. Beautifully written with an exciting and romantic plot,this is one book I will add to my list of favorites. Read it! You won't be able to put it down! (Oh, and the sequel is just as good!)
0399156577|5.0|I can sum up this book in one sentence.  I couldn't put it down until I finished it.  I would highly recommend this book.  Nora does it again.  This book was filled with information on the rescue of humans by our kindest dog friends.  The loyalty of dogs toward their human, lots of steamy scenes, varied personalities, search and rescue and of course great endings.  This is Nora's best work.  I loved it.  It shows how dogs play a very important part in the search and rescue of lost people and children.
0440133688|4.0|'The House of God' offers a view as to how people were treated when they went through Med school and residency in the 60's and 70's, (maybe as late as the 80's). It was mentally brutal, and those who couldnt 'hack it' either just dropped out, or went crazy.    I work as a nurse in a hospital and have been friends with a few docs both in private practice and in residency. Also, my dad did a stint in Med School before he decided it was nuts, so this book offered me an insight into what they went through.

For most, this book will be informative--you will certainly learn something about punctuation's proper usage, even if you consider yourself a punctuation guru--at the same time that is entertaining.      At first, I couldn't help but feel it to be somewhat of a waste (?) to devote one's entire life to the study of the ellipses \\"...\\" (cf.

030726999X|4.0|\\"..Hornet's Nest\\" is the final entry of the wonderful thriller/mystery series by Stieg Larsson.  No, I don't think it's quite as good as the first two books but nonetheless it is extremely well written and, ultimately, a satisfying read.  My issues with it:<br /><br />1) It literally carries forward from book two (\\"..Fire\\"), to the extent that I wonder why the last two books weren't combined into one?  One has to read \\"..Hornet's Nest\\" immediately after reading \\"..Fire\\" or risk struggling with the continuity.<br /><br />2) Too much time is devoted in the inner workings of government corruption that has plagued the leading character's (Salander) life.  Perhaps if I was Swedish I would find this intriguing, .. dunno.  But I found it tiresome.<br /><br />3) Too much talk, not enough action.<br /><br />Bottom line: oh, if you start upon Larsson's trilogy then '..Hornet's Nest\\" is a must read.  But it is a slightly disappointing read.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Somehow I felt that the Robert Langdon scenario got a bit long in the tooth here. The story was a bit too predictable and formulaic for my taste, dwelling on the same themes, plotting devices and character templates as \\"Angels & Demons\\" and \\"The DaVinci Code,\\" and as a result offering very little new for the reader. In addition things fall into place a little too conveniently at times and the fact that Langdon simply accepts the CIA's dictate without every questioning or barking back at Sato is a little hard to swallow. The fritction between these characters would really have needed a few \\"Who the Hell do you think you are?\\" and \\"Bite me!\\" moments to be convincing. The heavy religious tones in the Langdon stories are also getting a bit old and most importantly, this book suffers seriously from Dan Brown's moralistic finger throughout and slightly heavy-handed dissertation of the Ancient Mysteries, particularly in the end of the book at a time when the story should have been over.<br /><br />It is not a bad book by any stretch, but somehow I expected a little more, I'm afraid.
B000JIHP88|4.0|I love all the features of this mobile. The green leaves go up and down as it spins, the main panel lights up, and there are four different choices for song/sounds. I like that it's battery powered. My older son's mobile required cranking, and only stayed on for about 3 minutes. I also like that you can turn it on by remote, maybe giving yourself a few more minutes before the baby sees you and wants out!     The only negative so far is that it doesn't fit well on our crib. We have a sleigh-style crib, and it won't fit on any curved surface. I had to put it on the front rail (straight), but ours is pretty thick, so the clamp can't fit fully around the rail. It is on there, but not as well as it should be. It also pitches forward sort of awkwardly because it's not clamped right.

0761944524|5.0|My book arrived in great shape and it was early. The book itself is beautifully written in terms of simplicity and great examples. Statistics is taught conceptually so that it is possible to see what you are learning and apply it rather than relying on rote memorization or disconnected mathematical formulas. Class mates suggested this book at the beginning of stats but I was doing fine with the standard text book. Regrettably I had little idea of how the statistics worked in a whole sphere. This book helped with that
0316098337|5.0|ROOM is the  book everyone seems to be talking or blogging about lately, so I had to see what all the hype was about.  Here's the story -- Jack is the narrator of this story, and he has just turned five. He and Ma live in \\"Room\\", a 11' x 11' foot converted shed with a skylight.  Jack was born in \\"Room\\" and has never seen the outside world, except through the skylight overhead.  You see, Ma was kidnapped by sick in the head, Old Nick, seven years earlier and has been held prisoner ever since.<br /><br />Jack is a bright, inquisitive chatterbox. He sleeps with his Ma in bed, but when Old Nick comes for a visit, he hides in the wardrobe, and \\"counts the creeks on the mattress\\".  Ma keeps Jack busy most of the day reading to him, teaching him language games, and watching the television that Nick has provided for them. On Sundays, they get to request special treats.<br /><br />On Jack's 5th birthday Ma begins to educate him about the outside world he has never known except from what he has seen on television. Little by little she is teaching Jack what he will need to do, if they are ever to escape. She makes him understand that he is the one who will have to trick Old Nick. Neither Ma nor Jack is truly prepared for what life on the outside will be like for them.<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS - I liked this book a lot.  I generally enjoy children as narrators, but for some reason I had a tough time with the dialogue in the first (50) pages of this book.  Finally, I was able to go with the flow, and enjoy the rest of the story.  What made this novel work for me was the strong mother-child bond, despite the horrific circumstance. Even when Ma was so depressed she couldn't get out of bed, she did what she needed to do for her son.  I don't want to give any spoilers, even though most of you already know what happens, since the book was based on a true story which took place in Austria involving Elizabeth Fritzl.  I did find two parts of this story unrealistic; both occurred in the second half of the book.  Overall, I think the author wrote a terrific story: imaginative, touching, funny and sad. This story is likely to appeal to most readers.  Recommended<br /><br /> Rating 4.5/5 StarsOverall, I think the author wrote a terrific story: imaginative, touching, funny and sad.

B00371QQ0M|3.0|I just watched the blu-ray version of Dune, and I have to say there is nothing special about this release vs. the normal DVD release.  Same sound, same graphics.  I was hoping for a nice remastering of the content, but I guess we will have to wait for David Lynch to approve some sort of special version.    If you have the DVD version, wait, and do not pick this up.  If you have never watched the Dune movie before, grab some popcorn and enjoy and excellent story and adventure.
B00005OCMR|4.0|\\"Greetings programs!\\" - Before The Matrix Trilogy, Ultraviolet, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, The Last Starfighter and CG animated favorites; Kung-Fu Panda, Shrek, Ice Age, and others from Pixar, Tron became the first original granddaddy of CGI films from the early 80's when Apple and PC computer companies paralleled in popularity with arcade videogames for users. A classic like any other but never a dated relic if you were around when entering command codes on a computer screen was the way before GUI operating systems were invented. Today some users still rely on that old school method.<br /><br />\\"Hey who you calling 'program,' program?!\\" - For Tron, the story is pretty interesting about Flynn, a program engineer, trying to make ends meet as an ex employee to ENCOM after creating his own videogames, \\"Space Paranoids,\\" was ripped off by Ed Dillinger, an exec, makes several hack attempts in ENCOM's network to retrieve his memory file for retribution. Teaming with fellow programmers, Allen and Lori to infiltrate the MCP, Flynn gets digitized into the electroscopic world of cyberspace where programs; Tron, Ram, Chrome, etc. are forced to play gladiator videogames from light cycles to digital ring ball. Tanks, recognizers, guards, and red warriors are led by Sark to deres Flynn, Tron, and Yori from the grid as the MCP (Master Control Program) merges more programs to get bigger to affect the computer and the real world. And yet it's odd that Amazon Marketplace sellers priced this two to three times the regular store price I purchased at Fye's of $14.99.<br /><br />\\"End of line.\\" - The creative CGI effects were brilliant and first of its kind.

0143113100|4.0|This is a fascinating book, full of interesting stories about how various people have been able to live better lives by changing their brains--even cases that were once considered hopeless, like stroke victims.  The focus is \\"plasticity,\\" the idea that the brain is constantly growing and changing, and that various techniques can make it change and grow in desired ways.      Doidge knows that the brain is not infinitely changeable.  Alas, he leaves the reader with little idea when it is and when it isn't.  There's a lot of good science here but I felt that the focus was too much on inspirational stories, stories that are not always representative.  Too much of it read like a press release for the various techniques and therapies.      The book is also an attempt to revivify psychoanalysis, which is, after all, about brain plasticity.  \\"Analysis\\" promised to change how one's brain worked, converting unhealthy ways to healthy ones.  Wildly popular in the middle of the last century, few psychologists take it very seriously today.    Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, was brilliant, creative, learned, and hard-working.  He was also full of himself--and by the time of his death, psychoanalysis had become a self-contained cult, cut off from the mainstream of science.  It was also rather unsuccessful in curing mental problems.  In his later years, the Master himself touted it less as a cure and more as a fascinating journey into self-understanding.  Thus the never-ending analysis that Woody Allen lovingly satirizes.    In two chapters, Doidge points out ways in which psychoanalytic principles are compatible with modern plasticity research.  He is himself a psychoanalytic therapist and in chapter 9 presents a long case history of a man who was cured by his brand of analysis.  I was impressed.    Recommended, with caveats, to just about anyone interested in how the brain works.

0312360258|2.0|Zoey is just a normal girl until one day after school she is Marked. Marked to be a fledgling where in the next four years she will either turn into a gorgeous full grown vampire or she will die in the changing process.  While dealing with be the new kid in the elite school, her mom and step-dad's disgust with what she's become and the popular queen bee who can be quite the beeoch, she discovers she's a standout among the fledglings. Her crescent mark is filled in, like an adult vampire, yet she is still a fledgling. Zoey realizes that that the Goddess has chosen her specifically for a job. She just not sure what that is yet. Follow Zoey on her journey through school, boyfriends, death, affinities, war, betrayal, and friendship.   To start I had a love-hate relationship with these books. I've heard really great things about them but when I read the first book in the spring I was sadly disappointed. But I decided I would give there series another try. So I really tried to like the books but the really weren't that incredible and I only made it to book four. But here's more specifically what I thought about it.     Zoey and her friends are funny and very relatable. They really made the story readable. They had a really interesting dynamic together that made me want to be their friend too. Stevie Rae is southern bell with quite a sense of humor and a \\"mother hen\\" outlook. Damon, their openly gay friend, taught me some new words that I'm sure will probably show up in my SATs for which I thank him. Lastly, Zoey, though I wanted to shake her senseless sometimes she really was a strong heroine who dealt with horrible circumstances very realistically, she didn't pretend she was Super God and made everything perfect again. Because what teenager doesn't freak out a little when they're in over their head.     Overall I thought the House of Night series was lacking in maturity and action. One thing that drives me crazy in a book is parentheses. I can deal with one or two but one every page, not so much. When a novel is written in first person, like House of Night, I feel there is no need for them especially when your going to say something like this; \\"I learned it from Star Wars (I know I'm such a geek)\\". The novel fell flat in the action department. I wasn't on the edge of my seat at all. The novel was also a bit predictable. It lacked intrigue,  poise and overall sophistication. I felt like it was more written for middle grade. The only thing that made it YA was the swear words and occasional sexual references. Though it was nothing inappropriate and I would say middle grades could read it.
030726999X|5.0|Stieg Larsson has saved the best for last in terms of his trilogy that started with THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO and THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE. To reveal the plot would be to ruin the book. Leave it to say that Larsson is a master of the unexpected. A top notch thrill ride. Highly recommended.
0439023513|1.0|If you have read the other two books, you're going to read this one, but as others have already said I found it disappointing and unfulfilling. I feel we lost the charters with the separation of them. I didn't really care about anyone. It was only during the times that they interacted and spoke that I felt they were still the people I had come to love. I was okay with the Capitol brainwashing Peeta, but thought there could have more of the Real/ Not real stories and it should have happened sooner. I think you kind of understand him during those moments and it made him more likable. I missed the Peeta and Katniss interaction and was happy for them, but thought there should have been more development in their relationship. I kind of think Gale was fitting for this book too and Katniss says it perfectly at the end why she CHOOSE Petta.    But going with the other reviews I thought the war part was too much and the only time Katniss seemed herself was when she just happened to be in an area under attack. I understand that eventually too much bad and can make someone go crazy, but I think she had some things to hold onto that get forgotten. People I didn't care about got more airtime then people I wanted to know more about. Haymitch gets a side bar while I get to know Boggs. Cinna is in the entire book in a way, but I didn't feel anything when he was mentioned. The only time I felt anything was when Katniss is yelling at Buttercup. That was probably the only real part of the book. Anyway I just needed to get out my disappointment to others who might understand.

Audrey does an excellent job portraying a young blind woman who is terrorized by people trying to find something they believe she is hiding.  This is not a standard thriller.

Not a movie I would recommend if you are trying to find standard Audrey, but Audrey fans will enjoy as will fans of thrillers.

0812974611|4.0|After The Ghost (and the film The Ghost Writer) I wanted more Robert Harris. I respect Pompeii, but it didn't feel as accomplished to me. It has some of the Harris intelligence in the description of people, but the description of place is easily dominant. A history buff might revel, but that's not me. Roman civilization is no model for me, and a picture painted of the culture pales after a while A natural events buff might revel in the eruption described at length, but I found the characters rendered inconsequential and gray under the weight of Vesuvious. Another review warned that folks who wanted formula adventures should stay away. Harris has the taste and sensitivity to avoid crude formulas. But the plot follows predictable paths. And isn't shy about using some degree of coincidence to wrap things up.     With The Ghost, I was involved in the story, intrigued by the characters, welcoming of the plot twists, and made thoughtful by the politics subtext. I'd like to find more Robert Harris like that.

B001PJRAUS|5.0|If you're obsessed with accuracy and looking for a perfect Jane Austen rendition, move on. But if you've ever sat and read the book, saw an Austen movie, and closed your eyes and wished a thousand times that you could go back in time and live in Jane Austen's day, this is great entertainment. How many of us wish we could be part of Darcy's world? Meet a man with manners or live in a world without TV's, iPods, computers and learn what the true intercourse of conversation meant? How true it would be that our modern lifestyles would actually make it very hard for us to adapt into a time and place we merely romanticize over and over again. How odd those characters would think our mannerisms were in return!<br /><br />The series does just that, only Amanda's arrival sort of \\"buggers\\" up the story, if you get my drift. Nothing goes like it should and she tries to fix it all to the way it's suppose to be written in the book. Darcy, of course, is wonderfully attractive, the absolute snob, who can't figure out why he's \\"tormented\\" and attracted to a woman he frankly considers vulgar. It's fiction living inside of fiction - a phenomenal idea.<br /><br />All I can say to the die-hard Austen fans, is lighten up folks! It's meant to be fun and enjoyable, not a perfect rendition of the original. It's called creative liberty. What always amazes me about obsessed fans of certain genre, is that they treat the originals as if they were written by the finger of God on stone and we're not to change, alter, or enjoy it in any other manner. That, I think, is a great shame.
B000R4SMD6|5.0|I love this movie. The dialogue is outstanding. Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling  scenes are magic. Ryan Gosling has some of the greatest lines such as \\"you warned  me that he was smart, not that you were stupid.\\" Very appropriate line at that  moment in the movie. BUY this movie,
B001J4E1D8|3.0|It was one of those stories that breaks your heart in the end, but watching it I found it to be well portrayed in acting, setting, and costumes.  I must say you get caught up in each of the character's lives.  You feel terribly sorry for Tess' life and struggle of survival, angry at her unforgiving husband who frankly I blamed just as much for the outcome of her life, and ready to spit at the man who manipulates her to destruction.  If you can handle the outcome of the story, it's a good watch.  But if you're looking for an uplifting story to leave you feeling great, move on elsewhere.
B002ZG99G8|5.0|Surprisingly funny movie, and good action too.  I had no problems with delivery or quality.
B003Y3ZTGA|1.0|Katy Perry is the smartest person in the music biz these days...that is to say, her music is all business and zero art.  She doesn't write one lyric that doesn't illicit an immediate Pavlovian response (\\"I can sooo relate to her words!  OMG that's like EXACTLY what I did last Friday night!!!  TOTES!!!!!\\").  And anyone who thinks she's edgy at all (I know she has the \\"explicit lyrics\\" warning label on the cover, ooooo!)must have never left their home-schooled cocoon of a house ever.  NEVER EVER.  KP's formula for hit song 101:  1.  Come up with cliche song ideas:  partying, teen sex (treat it as if the subject is really \\"love\\" just like disillusioned teens think it is), hot California girls (never been done before!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!), sex, penis (to ensure the explicit warning!), lost love (awww), drug addiction (cool!  street cred), hot sex, out of this world SEX!, wistful heartache (can't all you girls, I mean gurls, relate??  Katy understands YOUR pain, so fork over the cash because she wrote YOUR anthem!!!).  2.  Write lyrics that leave absolutely nothing to the imagination.  Spell out every emotion the listener is supposed to feel as they listen.  She's very smart like I said.  She knows that teenage girls are a breeze to manipulate.  Just because she's a female role-model (I guess) doesn't mean she shouldn't exploit those she inspires, right?  3.  (This is very important so read carefully!), make sure you sing those lyrics as clearly as possible and with perfect enunciation so that, again, there is absolutely no room for interpretation.  There also is no emotion or realness to anything she sings at all for that matter.  And speaking of her \\"singing\\", um, her voice is really bland and middle of the road, don't cha think?  I guess that's why she pretends to be a sex kitten.  It's all just a distraction from the unhipness and boring nature of her music.  4.  Hire the latest collaborators and producers your family money can buy.  If you weren't born into Hollywood money and connections like Katy was, just hope you can skate by without this step.  5.  Finally, the last bit of marketing genius, her image.  Use sex appeal just enough to make people think you're a vixen, but somehow still be as vanilla as disney.  (Remember, teenagers need to buy your music because anyone with a fully formed mind of their own will see right through your every ploy.)  She's got a great body and is very pretty, sure, but she comes across about as hip as my grandmother.  And she has absolutely NO PERSONALITY!  So I take back the grandma part...mine had one.  Peace out, yo.
B003RUZKC8|3.0|Hey I'm a tough critic or would give this movie four stars. But I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised. A very fun film with plenty of action, good character development, fairly good storyline and a nice segue for a sequel (yeah you get to the end and you're left hanging a bit). I saw the big budget \\"Expendables\\" a week ago, and I can tell you this film is what that one should have been. Whereas I left the Expendables laughing at one helluva terrible script, I came away from this one wanting more.
B000089A06|4.0|Being the introduction to Hannibal Lecter (in Thomas Harris' books anyway), the movie Red Dragon gives viewers a good taste of Lecter and his personality.  However, like many viewers, I had seen \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" before I watched \\"Red Dragon.\\"  Although Hopkins' performance in both is magnificent, one doesn't get the same sense of utter awe for Lecter when he makes his first appearance in RD as when he does in SOTL.  Therefore I would recommend seeing SOTL before seeing RD.    On the other hand, if you have seen \\"Silence,\\" definitely see \\"Red Dragon.\\"  The story is intriguing as it follows a sharp detective, Will Graham (played very well by Edward Norton), coming out of early retirement to help hunt down the unusual Tooth Fairy killer (excellent performance by Ralph Fiennes).  The \\"Tooth Fairy's\\" character is absolutely fascinating in the book, which unfortunately is barely skimmed in the movie.  Also, Crawford is played by Harvey Keital rather than Scott Glenn, which was a bit strange to get used to as they both play the role totally differently.    I finished this movie with my heart pounding.  The action is great, as is the suspense, and the deep meaning behind it all is something else entirely.  Although Red Dragon comes in third in my mind when I rank the Hannibal Lecter movies (not counting \\"Hannibal Rising\\" - I feel it is in a different category), it is still a brilliant movie and one a true Lecter fan must see.
B003L77TZI|5.0|This album was not made for serious musicians who listen to every detail and judge harshly, it was made for people who want to have fun! It does have some serious songs like \\"Who Am I Living For?\\", \\"Pearl\\" and \\"Not Like The Movies\\" but they add a balance to the album. Sure some lyrics are.. empty, but they're still playful fun.    Btw the lyric book smells SO good! I try to read the songs, but I just end up smelling the pages.. lol.    My fave songs are:  - California Gurls  - Firework  - Circle the Drain &  - Who Am I Living For?    Other good songs:  - Teenage Dream  - Peacock  - E.T.  - Pearl &  - Hummingbird Heartbeat    Songs I can stand, but aren't my faves (this really depends on your taste of music, some might be your faves):  - Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)  - The One That Got Away &  - Not Like the Movies  (The chorus of Not Like the Movies says: \\"if its not like the movies, that's how it should be\\" and it sounds like she's saying \\"if its not like the movies, its NOT supposed to be like the movies\\", but she's actually saying \\"if its not like the movies, it SHOULD be like the movies\\". I don't like how it was unclear. There is actually a youtube video that explains what she means of the song: [...] please copy paste and see for yourself. Or just type \\"Katy talks Not Like the Movies\\" on the youtube search thingy.)    Still a great, fun, yummy smelling album! Buy it!! xD
B000OPOAMA|5.0|Although it took several weeks for \\"Hannibal\\" to arrive, the product was well worth the wait.  This steelbook edition is lovely - a definite must-buy for Lecter fans.  As for the movie itself, I enjoyed it very much.  \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" will always be my favorite of the Lecter series, but \\"Hannibal\\" is a close second.    I found the plot to be rather slow-moving at first, but this was partly a good thing as it took me a little time to get adjusted to Julianne Moore's portrayal of Starling (which, although quite different from Jodi Foster's, was still well-suited to the character).  Ridley Scott builds the suspense gradually and slowly, waiting for viewers to be silently begging for some real action before the plot takes off.  Once it does, you will be at the edge of your seat until the credits roll.  I found certain scenes in \\"Hannibal\\" to be almost more chilling than those in SOTL, and I am still reeling from the end.  The acting, as to be expected, was no less than exceptional, especially in the case of Anthony Hopkins.    Both \\"Silence\\" and \\"Hannibal\\" are works of art, though in different categories.  While \\"Silence\\" had an intense, gritty air, \\"Hannibal's\\" was graceful and smooth, although no less gruesome.  Both tones work fantastically for their genre and I love both movies.  If you liked \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" and \\"Red Dragon,\\" you will find \\"Hannibal\\" to be a fitting end for the series.
0143118420|2.0|Disclaimer: If you find this review unhelpful, I ask that you please leave a comment telling me why. I know that a lot of Amazon users automatically vote \\"no\\" if the reviewer disagrees with their own person opinion, but I know that none of you will be that small-minded :)I write a lot of product views on Amazon, as well as make videos, so I would like to know what I can do to be more helpful in the future. Thanks.    Eat, Pray, Love is a story about a poor, unfortunate soul with a beautiful home, a great career in New York, and an extremely devoted husband--yet she is still somehow unfulfilled. Elizabeth Gilbert has reached the thirty year mark, and at that age, her friends and family are expecting her to have kids. However, Elizabeth does not want children and instead thanks the Lord every time that Mr. Monthly Visitor arrives. After many nights of boo-hooing on the bathroom floor, Elizabeth finally makes the mature decision to divorce her husband, voluntarily granting  him all of the couple's assets out of immense guilt. My only thought during this entire section was \\"These two individuals had been married for several years, and they couldn't have previously discussed the issue of having children? She couldn't have just said 'Hey, I don't want any kids,' before they got into a committed relationship with a large home and joint debt?\\" So, after Liz leaves her husband, she runs immediately into the arms of another man. Unfortunately, this real prince of a guy is the next one to do the dumping, and Mrs. Gilbert finds herself heartbroken again. Instead of entering another hasty relationship, she goes to her editor and says that she would like to travel the world. After obtaining a substantial advance to fund the adventure that would later become this book, Liz sets off for Italy. Why Italy? Apparently, for the last several years, Elizabeth has been starved both emotionally and physically. She is not used to eating for anything other than pure sustenance, so she decides that Italy (with its beautiful scenery and diet rich in carbohydrates) is the perfect place to gorge herself. While most people would have just made a trip to their local McDonald's for a real binge-fest, this pampered rich princess feels the need to travel halfway across the world to do one of life's most basic tasks: Eat a really good meal. While in Italy Elizabeth *supposedly* gains a lot of weight, but instead of being proud of her newly full-figure, she continuously reminds the reader that she was WAY underweight to begin with--I guess to prevent us all from thinking that she had become a prized heifer. For the \\"Pray\\" part of the novel--which I admittedly stopped reading after the first disgusting half--Liz goes to India. O...kay? Once again, I am a little baffled by the extravagance at which this woman goes to complete such a basic task. If I wanted to pray or achieve spiritual enlightenment, I would go down the street to my local church, sit in for a service on Sunday, and ask if there was anything that I could do to be of help to the congregation...but I guess Elizabeth Gilbert does not live near any churches. After she is through praying in India, Elizabeth goes to Indonesia for the \\"Love\\" portion of the book. In what was the one selfless act of this entire novel, Elizabeth forgoes birthday gifts from her friends and encourages them to help a homeless woman get back on her feet. In the end, she does indeed find love and ends up marrying a wonderful gentleman. The end (thank god).    After reading so many positive reviews of Eat, Pray, Love, I wonder if I am simply missing something. Is it because I am not a pampered, thirtysomething woman who has the option to travel across the world whenever I get the slightest whim? While I understand that this is a memoir, which therefore entitles the author to be selfish and self-indulgent to some degree, I have never been more thoroughly repulsed in all of my life. I do not admire this woman in any way, and the onlygood thing that came out of my reading this book is that I will see to it that I never become a spoiled b*tch like her. Had Elizabeth Gilbert's journey for self-acceptance happened purely by kismet, I would have been more respectful of her problems. But this gal divorced her husband, got jilted by another man, and then approached her editor for a hefty sum of money so that she could travel the world and write a novel about her journey. Seriously? I just really don't understand why some people are so fascinated with Mrs. Gilbert's story. I am a twenty-year-old full-time college student with an $8.00 an hour job at a department store, and I know many people of my own age who have FAR greater issues than the author of this novel--and they are MUCH more mature in dealing with them. Had Elizabeth been suffering from a terminal cancer or even if her husband had divorced HER, I would have been more sympathetic. But her only real problem was that she had fallen out of love with her husband and no longer wished to have children. Call me crazy, but doesn't this happen everyday? What makes this woman so special? Because she has the funds to travel around the world and write about it, therby fulfilling every lonely housewife's greatest fantasy?Seriously, Elizabeth Gilbert, get over yourself.

1439102813|3.0|I just finished Still Alice and for the most part it was a good read.  I agree with some of the reviewers that the author's writing style isn't elegant, but it was not so bad that I couldn't get into the story and finish the book.  I thought Genova did a good job showing the gradual decline that Alzheimer's brings, but I didn't feel as moved as I expected I would.  I think one thing that really bothered me (and it's petty I suppose) is that we're reminded on almost every page that Alice is a HARVARD professor.  I am a professor and liked how this is the profession Genova gave to Alice.  Of course this disease is devastating to all who endure it, but making the character a person that relies on critical thinking and sharpness in writing and language daily gives the story an added twist.  I guess I just felt that once we've been told that she's a Harvard professor, that's enough.  A professor at Harvard or a professor at a community college would both have the same problems with the disease.  Mentioning it over and over made Alice (and the author) seem a little like a snob. Like I said, this is not a huge detractor from the story, just something that bugged me.  This story was one that kept me turning the pages, but not one that drew me in so much that I will keep the book to read it again.  For those interested in Alzheimer's and memory it is something I would highly recommend.  If you are looking for a tear jerker though, this is not it.  There were a couple of poignant moments, but they didn't quite get me there.
0679720200|3.0|OK, i will make two reviews of this book and you can choose the one that best suits you:    - THE POLITICALLY CORRECT REVIEW: Albert Camus develops his philosophy in a story where the absurd and the quest for existentialism merge. Meursault, the main character, kills an Arab in a confusing situation and ends up being judged by this crime. The absurdity of human life, the arbitrariness of justice and the importance of phisical experiences are depicted in an exquisite yet profound way.    - THE ALTERNATIVE REVIEW: don't expect any intrigue or suspense from this pretty dull book. Mersault, the main character, is a man who doesn't really know what to do with his life and kills an Arab in a beach because the sun was annoying him (this is what \\"the absurd\\" is all about). The so-called arbitrariness of justice is nothing but a proper trial. Only in the last chapter did I find some interesting thoughts but I could have saved my time and read just that. Surely won't change your life...    I have mixed feelings, I couldn't decide for one of both reviews.
0439023491|5.0|I was thinking myself pretty clever guessing all the twists ahead of time along the way, but just like the manipulation of the Capitol, I was lulled into a false sense of security and was gobsmacked by the ending. And I've always been and always will be Team Gale.
B003NX76BM|2.0|I am a big fan of Nora Robert's books, and have many of her books on my \\"keeper\\" shelf.  This one is not a keeper (in fact, don't bother to buy it, wait until you can get it second hand).  The only thing good I can say about the book is that the banter between her characters is, as usual, just like conversations between real people.    The lead female character spends most of the book in lecture/training mode - training dogs and trying to train the lead male character. He, on the other hand, comes across as a self-centered wimp with flashes of I'm-going-to-take-care-of-the-little-woman. Neither character makes you want to read more about them.    If you are a cat person don't even open the book. If you are a dog person,then you will at least get a story about dogs.
0807014273|5.0|A friend recommended this book after a discussion of \\"character motivation\\" in science fiction. I am so glad he did. Frankl was a psychiatrist working on a theory of what motivated mankind when he was thrown in a Nazi concentration camp. He survived in large part because he had something to live for--the publication of his work. The first part of the book details survival within the concentration camp. This part alone is worth the book's price. Unlike Hollywood depictions of camps, he shows what the inmates actually had to do in order to survive (they would do just about anything not to be on a \\"list\\") and he even shows the occasional humanity of some of the guards, even, amazingly, the final commandant of his camp.     The second part of the book is a brief summary of Frankl's theories called logotherapy. I can't say I'm an expert on this; he published over 20 volumes on the subject. But what I read here is fascinating. In summary, he believes that man's search for meaning is his primary motivation, unlike Freudian psychology which teaches that man's search for pleasure is his primary motivation.    I plan to reread this book regularly. Truly inspirational.
B002ZG980U|3.0|The movie Inception is Christopher Nolan taking you into a shared dream of his. Most of our dreaming takes place in the darkness of the night. The dark theater replicates this scenerio. The movie opens in mid action like that of most dreams you don't know how you got there you just did. The screen becomes the screen of our minds that our dreams are reflected upon. The totem at the end of the movie can't stop spinning as long as we are watching because we have yet to decide what of this whole experience, was or is real. When the theater lights come on like that of a rising sun, we then awake, and if so inspired we try to recall the details of the projected images.  The movie was a \\"good attempt\\" at a fabulous human experience but lacked the morphing, the running together, the incompleteness that takes place in actual dreams. I look forward to someone really willing to roll the dice on this subject. Maybe 'Inception' can be the platform from which to jump from.

B002JVWR0Y|5.0|This was the most emotional season of Dexter so far. It was hard to see trinity killing all the young girls and family people, it was hard to see frank lundy die. it was heartbreaking to see Deb's emotions when she found out who her brother's brother was, but to top that all off it was harder still to see the ending. i couldn't believe the ending to this season. how could there possibly be a fifth season after that?<br /><br />the first part of the season brought back a lot of the humor that season three lacked, but after the first half it got dark quickly. I will probably have to wait a whole year to see season five, and i will wait. I just can't get over the ending. can someone please tell me why they did what they did.

0439023483|4.0|So, apparently... I'm late to the party... again. I've been told by countless friends and bloggers that I need to read THE HUNGER GAMES by Suzanne Collins. My best friend raved about it. But... dystopian books really aren't my thing. I decided to pick it up anyway, and it's been sitting on my shelf for a couple years.<br /><br />With the release of MOCKINGJAY and the frenzy surrounding it, I decided to start reading. As with other dystopian novels, I had a hard time getting into the book. Figuring out what their world was like and trying to get a grasp on the situation. All I can say is... I'm really glad I don't live in this world.<br /><br />A boy and girl from each district are chosen every year to fight to the death in a televised event. All contestants range from ages 12 to 18. And only one can survive. Katniss volunteered to go to The Hunger Games, in the place of her little sister, Prim. And Peeta was chosen to go along as well to represent District 12. There is an interesting dynamic between these two characters. It's written from Katniss' point of view, so you don't always know what Peeta's thinking. But then, you don't always know exactly what Katniss is thinking, either.<br /><br />They are given the royal treatment as they prepare for the games, and their mentor, a previous winner from District 12, is a drunk. (Although I did really enjoy Haymitch). Their team tries to prepare them. They get tossed into an arena and are expected to kill every other teen there. How can anyone be prepared for that?<br /><br />So, yeah... this book definitely didn't seem like something I'd enjoy reading. But the writing was fantastic. I enjoyed many of the characters and look forward to getting to know them better, especially Gale. A few scenes made me weepy, and once made me actually cry. While I liked the book, I didn't love it as many of my friends did. But I'm definitely glad I took the time to read it, and I already pulled CATCHING FIRE from my shelf. I definitely recommend it.<br /><br />I loved the names in this book, especially Katniss Everdeen.<br /><br />There are three \\"teams\\" fans of this series has chosen: Team Peeta, Team Gale, and Team Katniss. I see a lot of people on Peeta's team, but I don't feel Gale was given a good enough shot. So I'm reserving my right to choose a team affiliation until later. Temporarily though, I'm Team Katniss.<br /><br />Down with the Capitol!n this book, especially Katniss Everdeen.

0061914177|3.0|The ideas behind this book make sense, but the examples are too ambiguous for the average person to execute.  This book can get the reader all excited to go out and live their passion, then they have no direction on exactly how they should accomplish it.  For me, a total waste of money.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|The series in itself is great. BUT, this is the inferior version.     Frankly, I don't care about Oprah - neither hate nor love her.     Personally, I prefer Attenborough so I will reduce a star for that.     MORE importantly, all the episodes are 720p NOT 1980p; whereas the Attenborough version has all but one in 1080p (full hd).     Admittedly, it has a better menu BUT it is an inferior product (not only because of my choice of narrator - and I have watched both versions completely) but because you pay the same price for inferior resolution.
B000244EMO|1.0|I loved the Predator movies when I was younger, so I bought the collectors edition. WHen it comes in I open the package, and they didn't include the movie. I got two discs of disc 2! So I have no movie, but 2 discs of special features. What the hell is that?
0739499963|4.0|All of Sparks' other books, of which I've read two and this is the third, have been easy reading novels, and this one is no exception.  The quality of the writing, and the content, is like viewing a Norman Rockwell painting.  If you ever are in need of a good book, one that won't disappoint, you can rely on a Nicholas Sparks novel.<br /><br />This book reminded me of Walk Across America, which was a true story by the way.  The book's premise of walking across the country to find a woman you only have a picture (a lucky picture at that)of may be far-fetched (and daunting), but that only adds to the mounting tension and romance.  Logan withholds his lucky snapshot of her, and it's frustrating to Beth, with her woman's intuition, as well as us, the readers.  But that also adds to the building suspense. How clever.<br /><br />Logan seems so lame at times.  At other times, quite ingenius.  So, he reminds me of myself.<br /><br />Near the end it is like a soap opera, with all the characters vying for attention, especially Clayton.  This is not the super romantic love story I was hoping for, and which Sparks is capable of , but it is a very good novel just the same.
B003YP0BI4|5.0|This is a great Iron Maiden album if you are a true fan of Iron Maiden.  If you just like Run to the Hills, and Aces High, and Fear of the Dark, or just a couple of their songs, this album is not for you.  If you love Seventh Son, and Brave New World as albums, than you will be hooked.  This is a phenomenal Maiden LP in the hallowed tradition of outstanding Maiden LPs.  Listen to Satellite 15...The Final Frontier, as the frantic opening sets the mood for the entire record, then comes out of nowhere as the Final Frontier breaks out; a vintage Maiden tune, full of classic lyrics, inspired by a sci-fi concept, but it is really just a metaphor about living a life of no regrets.<br /><br />El Dorado gets its lyrics from the history books, but is that really what its about?  Just like the previous song, and so many other Maiden tunes, it takes its words from history, literature, and mythology, but drenches the mood with statements that make you realize their songs have double meanings.  I think it could be about selling your soul to the devil for fame, and fortune, yet you end up getting ripped off in the end, but I could be wrong.  It is definately a classic, yet 21st century Iron Maiden song, and will have you rocking out with your c**k out.<br /><br />The album continues on with mainly mid-paced progressive metal songs, and the remaining high points are the Alchemist, Isle of Avalon, the Man Who Would Be King, and When the Wild Wind Blows.  But the entire CD flows, and takes time to fully appreciate.  Is this the Final Frontier for Maiden.  I hope not, but if it is, it is a great way to go out.
0307577589|4.0|I listened to this on an audio CD. If I was reading the book I would have stopped after the first two chapters. It is very wordy with a lot of unecessay information. However, if you can make it through the first 3/4 of the book it really becomes interesting. In fact, I was left hanging at the end and am about to order the second in the series. I'm not quite sure why, but I have to know about the main character, Lizabeth. Try it, you'll like it.
B001L1S1SK|5.0|Ugly Betty is one of my favorite tv shows so of course it was cancelled. Just my luck. At least I can buy it on DVD. The only thing I didn't like on the first disk was all the ABC ads for it's other shows but the whole set is wonderful.
0439023513|3.0|I am a big fan of the first two Hunger Games books. This final book in the series does not live up to the previous installments I am afraid. The writing style is still punchy and readable, but I felt that the characters' authenticity derailed and the larger social commentary theme just went nowhere. Katniss, who was so alive and real in the other books, starts acting strange.     The resolution of the love triangle will leave no one happy. She could choose either guy or neither guy, but in the end she just makes a hasty choice by default and the motivation, reasoning, or ramifications for this choice are not explained. It felt rushed and not emotionally satisfying.     The same disconnect happens with the resolution of the war and the hunger games. What Katniss does to \\"save the world\\" at the end left me wondering how a new better world could be founded with an action like that. I felt the ending sabotaged the greater social commentary of the series.     On the other hand, I did have fun reading the book and finished quickly, which is a good sign for me. It is a fun read even if there may be some disappointment in the resolution of the series.
B003S897UK|4.0|This collection is awesome, yet typical of Warren Haynes. First met him in the men's bathrooom line at a break in the used-to-be annual New Year's show at Asheville's defunct Be Here Now. A Southern gent. A bit Ronnie Van Zant, a bit off the chain. I've tracked him and the band as it has morphed. But the one constant is Warren. He is not one to compromise. I admire his \\"mission\\" to tell - to mesmerize with his talent and to stun at live shows. I remember interviewing him from Athens, Ga., by telephone at his New York home soon after he married. He gushed about Mountain -- how he was looking for a Felix Pappalardi sound. I believe he had found that in Woody. He won me over with his sincerity and sheer muscle as a player. Haynes is complimented to the hilt by Matt Abts. Sit near the front of a show, and you will be treated with some equally sincere shirt-ruffling pulses that are intent - not arrant. Most think Warren is the show. But check out Abts. He's not exactly watching the clock, and he loves to pounce.
0307454541|4.0|This was one of our book club picks since we're seeing it everywhere now.  There are three different plots weaved together, one more interesting than the others.  I have to say it seemed like a lot of the sex was completely unneccessary and ridiculous.  We also watched the Swedish movie and thought it was a great adaptation.
B001FXCE46|4.0|When you listen to song after song, the band's flaws become obvious even to a tin ear like myself. They don't play that well. Sounds like if they got anything too complicated to play, they'd be in real trouble. The lyrics are often awful if not downright unintelligible. \\"We'll teach this city to kiss these thighs\\" (or some such nonsense). And the singer doesn't have that great of a voice. And you can only sometimes understand what's he's singing to begin with.      But you know what? All those \\"negatives\\" come together and cancel each other out enough to make a couple of really good songs. The hook is catchy, the music just right and the singer's wail is pitch perfect. (no pun intended).    \\"Sex on Fire\\" and \\"Use Somebody\\" are my favorites. But I also enjoyed \\"Closer\\", \\"Revelry\\" and \\"17\\".
B003EW4K7K|4.0|I'll admit first up that I'm not really a big Stones fan.  I've always believed that musically they are unbelievably over-rated relative to their peers such as The Beatles, The Who, The Kinks, The Beach Boys hell even the Animals but I won't begrudge their great stage act and longevity and hence their great influence on rock and roll overall albeit not necessarily on the artistic and musical aspects of the genre; I suppose they were never really about that anyway being more about how to abuse drugs and alcohol without dying but I have to say that \\"Sticky Fingers\\" is my favourite album of theirs with \\"Beggars Banquet\\" coming in a close second.  If only they'd be a little more original instead of doing so many covers that because are not remotely as good as the originals only come across as disrespecting the greats like Robert Johnson, Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Buddy Guy et al.<br /><br />Still this album after the other two mentioned is my 3rd favourite Stones album because all their r&b/rock n roll influences are heard here from outright covers like \\"Stop Breaking Down\\" which admittedly is still better than \\"Love In Vain\\" on \\"Let It Bleed\\" which must really have made Mr. Johnson turn in his grave to the mere sound alikes of the majority of this album to Chuck Berry, Little Richard and the rest.  I have nothing against imitating the greats but for a band that's been around for so long - much longer than the Beatles - for example and yet to do so little innovation of their own is hard to take in.  The sound quality is overall pretty good on this mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version although it is not uniformly so as a couple of the later tracks sound a little muddy in spots.<br /><br />Overall, trackwise this is in my opinion a good r&b/rock n roll jam and a pleasant listen and fans are in for a real treat with this mlps version which although isn't the best that I've seen still faithfully recreates the original vinyl sleeve and is acceptably well assembled.  The \\"Sticky Fingers\\" mlps release though is miles better and is a must have for mlps collectors.  Two cardboard squares representing the original vinyl center circles as well as the two inner sleeves and the mini-b&w postcards are included.  Also included is a 24-page booklet with all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.<br /><br />An enjoyable Stones album now comes in a decent mlps version with mostly good sound quality makes this version of \\"Exile On Main Street\\" recommended!s release though is miles better and is a must have for mlps collectors.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|as the final book in a brilliant series, i thought that it may be a bit of a letdown. however,my fears were not realized, and i find the last book just as good as the first 2 books. i love the message in this book-that wars are completely worthless, and that we are all people. i would recommend this book to anyone who likes action, adventure, and lots of emotion.
B0000024T3|5.0|Este cd es una producci&oacute;n maravilllosa. Una joven jovenc&iacute;sima Barbra canta estas canciones del repertorio popular franc&eacute;s y de temas americanos que se hicieron muy populares en la Ciudad Luz o fueron inspirados por ella. Barbra canta con una pasi&oacute;n y un desenfado espectaculares y est&aacute; acompa&ntilde;ada de una orquesta maravillosa que interpreta los inigualables arreglos de otro genio de la m&uacute;sica como es Michel Legrand. Un &aacute;lbum fresco y apasionado. Una delicia escucharlo.
B003HFFVDQ|5.0|I just need to say that not since Dig Your Own Hole have I listened to a Chemical Brothers album and not had mixed feelings about it. Maybe that's a confusing statement. I mean, that if I was to rank Chemical Brothers albums, I would probably tie Exit Planet Dust & Dig Your Own Hole (1st and 2nd places), and Further at 3rd. No mixed feelings about this album here.    There has always been some kind of goofy song or lyric that keeps me from enjoying their whole albums. Listening to Surrender I despised hearing the lyric \\"Superstar DJs... Here we go!\\". On Come With Us, \\"My Elastic Eye\\" was like 'yeah, I guess I see what you're trying to do here, but this is too goofy'. \\"Denmark\\" was redundant. I missed Push the Button altogether (Oops). And We Are the Night's single \\"Do It Again\\" was the lowest of the low in Chemical Brothers canon. Of course these albums had lots of great moments too, but it was these lame songs that kept me from keeping the Chemical Brothers as one of my favorite groups ever.    When I heard Further though, everything came easy. These were the Brothers that had impeccable taste--that could do no wrong. I mean it isn't mindblowing music or anything, but it's fresh and fun. It's full of great beats and flashy production (albeit less funk-laden than back in the day) and that's why we look forward to a new Chemical Brothers album! I also appreciate how these new songs are more skeletal in a way; they are built on simple chords or riffs, the vocals are only like one or two lines per song. In general, there are fewer ideas going on at once yet this does not detract from how interesting the songs are.    I'd say that if you have fallen away from whatever THE BROTHERS have been doing for whatever reason, try this new one out. I'm sure they will swoon the pants right off you.
0439023513|5.0|Wow!  Turned upside down and ripped inside out is how I feel after finishing this book this morning.   What an amazing journey.  Totally unexpected but I can't imagine a better, more profound ending to this incredible story.  Thank you, Suzanne Collins.  Thank you for introducing these amazing people (OK, I realize they're really just characters) into my life.  You've made me rethink more than a few of my assumptions about life - which is the point of great writing, right?
0882709194|1.0|I thought I was being given a free copy of one of the greatest books in human history. No, I was given a piece of disgraceful propaganda. Do not purchase this version and do not bother to look at if you are handed a free copy. The author uses the book to advance his version of Christianity, eviscerate other religious, and destroy evolution and Charles Darwin.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|I was going to write an in-depth and hopefully witty review of Quentin Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds, but seeing as there are more than 500 reviews already that have probably covered everything a potential viewer would want to know, let me just say this:    It's darn near as perfect and dazzling a movie as you're going to find.    Well, that's that, then. On to my review of hummingbird feeders...
0307987698|5.0|I can understand some reviewers being sad at yet another re-written classic that didn't need to be....but really this is not a bad book!  Its is just as fun as the first one, especially when Grover & Elmo get to the last page, anticipating a monster and scare each other half to death....kids LOVE how they scream \\"AAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGHHHHHH!\\" at the shock of seeing one another.  So yeah, even though I usually don't like remakes & sequels, especially concerning things that were near and dear to me as a child (as the original was), and while I also got tired of the whole Elmo craze and preferred the original Sesame Street characters, I still have a great love for this book & would encourage anyone and everyone to get it.  If your child loves the first one, they are all the more invested in finding out what happens in the next one, and isn't the point to get them to love reading anyway?
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is JUST what I needed. I am not trying to lose weight, but rather gain definition and tone, particularly in the thigh, buttocks, and hip area. I am 5'4\\", 119 lbs., so my weight is right on, but for the longest time, all I wanted was to gain muscle definition and improve fitness.  I was thin but totally OUT OF SHAPE- Not good.    I have four children and for the longest time I made attempts at being commited to exercising, only to last a month or so at best.  In the past I have tried different DVD's, but due to knee problems I try to stick with lower impact moves.     My New Year Resolution for 2010 was to get stronger, leaner, and fit.  I bought the Fluidity bar and videos and enjoyed them, so  decided adding to the collection, along those same lines, and bought The Bar Method DVD's, The Lotte Berke DVD's,and the  Core Fusion ones too(love these), and some Yoga. These are all great, particularly for gaining flexibility, and I definitely got some visible definition, but not to the degree I wanted, eventhough I had been working out since January 2010, at least two to three times a week on a bad week, and as much as five times a week on a good week.  Still, I felt I needed more to get the results I wanted.    I then tried the Insanity workout. Sadly, I could not go on doing it after two weeks; too intense and too high impact for my knees, but I will say for the first time I saw my body fat percentage drop from 26% to 23% in those two short weeks, so I knew it was working.  Interval training definitely works wonders.    I went back to my beloved, though not as effective, and can get boring, Bar related videos.  That's when I found that Time Warner Cable had Exercise TV on demand for FREE!!:):), and it was an awesome discovery, since I can vary workouts as much as I want without buying a ton of DVD's, and they have workouts as short as 10 minutes to about an hour, to fit on any given time of day. I was intrigued by the Jillian Michaels 30 day shred, because she hasthe type of body I want, i.e., fit and strong, yet curvy. So I tried it......I could do most of the video as I have been working out regularly, with the exception of the push ups- which I could only do five or so normal ones, and then switch to modified--     I found it intense but quick, and fast paced (A GOOD, ANTI BOREDOM THING)....Also, I find Jillian a great motivator, and she's definitely not wimpy nor is annoying in any way.    24 hours later....VOILA!!!....MY WHOLE BODY WAS SORE, PARTICULARLY THOSE AREAS I HAVE WANTED TO TONE FOREVER, unsuccesfully:) YEAY!! I mean, with all the different workouts I have used, I never had sore inner thighs like this, nor as sore shoulders and upper arms, sore legs, and SORE BUTTOCKS:):), etc.. I can tell it worked out areas/muscles that most others have missed, and the innner thigh has always been a particular area of concern.  I was SO SORE, I could not work out the next day.     I was very hungry the next day all throughout the day, and I could tell it was my body needing protein to build muscle, so I made it a point to eat quite a bit more lean protein that day.    I skipped a day and did it again, and the soreness was felt right after the workout.  Eventhough I have only done it twice, I can tell I will stick with it and expect to see muscle definition and improve my fitness.   Also, TIme Warner on Demand only has level 1 available now, but I saw that Amazon has levels 2 and 3 for $1.99 each, a very good deal, so I will get it here when I am through with the free level 1 through Time Warner.      The only caution I need to take (or anyone with knee problems): go easier on the knees when jumping, always keep them flexed, and protect them by mindfully checking their alignment on the exercises.... but the degree and impact of jumping here so far is MUCH less than the Insanity workout. I cannot wait to day 30 so I can post the results as a follow up.
0375831002|5.0|The story is narrated by Death, who is out collecting souls.  Mainly it concerns Liesel Meminger and the people around her - in particular her foster parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann, her particular friend, Rudy Steiner, and a Jew in hiding, Max Vandenburg.  The story starts in 1939 when 9-year-old Liesel (not quite ten) arrives on Himmel Street in Molching, a town on the outskirts of Munich.  It continues through the war years to 1943, as people struggle to survive, men from the town are sent to the Eastern Front in Russia, and Death strips away people around Liesel.  Along he way Liesel steals books and learns to read and write.  It skips forward with an Epilogue to the end of the war in 1945, and ends with Liesel in Australia, the home country of the author.<br /><br />Along the way you will get a good picture of life in a small town in Nazi Germany during the war.

B003E8P9G0|5.0|\\"The Red Pyramid\\" is an intriguing adventure, bringing the secrets of Ancient Egypt alive in a fresh way, appropriate to the pace of our instant-messaging world. I enjoyed this first episode even more than the Percy Jackson series. I really got into the head of the main character, Carter Kane, and how his life falls apart after an explosion in the British Museum. Secrets about Carter's family and riddles of the Pharaohs mingle in this exciting tale. Sadie, Carter's sister, is a good counterpoint and her perspective lets you view their challenges in a very different way. I'm eager to join them in the next volume of this series.
B0007TKH66|5.0|I do like this first season effort of Enterprise. Scott Bakula was the only reason I bothered to watch.  It's too bad that there was nothing to connect the casual viewer to the series.  This one had the mistake of being too concerned with Trek lore.  They took the blue and grey colors of Star Trek: The Motion Picture and used them in every aspect of the sets.  The show, unlike the former ones, was very unattractive to the eye.  While I did like the quality of the writing, the sets were not nice to look at.  It was like the crew was in a submarine each week. The stories were recyled from every other Trek show since NG.<br /><br />If not for Scott Bakula, I do not think I would have purchased this set.  What I would like to know is why he didn't have any story input into his character?  The fourth season under Manny Coto could have saved this show. We'll never get to see season's 5,6 or 7.  I believe Judith and Garfield Reeves Stevens term as story editors could have continued the series,with better stories.  It's too bad Paramount decided to cancel.  Compared to the reality shows that proliferate TV today, I would rather see this show now more than ever.
B003OF3R0S|5.0|I lost a lot of faith in Avenged Sevenfold after the self titled CD. I thought City of Evil had some great riffs and drumming , but Shadows voice was extremely whiny and Axl Rose-ish , in a bad way. Self Titled was overall very lazy sounding , too pop-ish etc. I've been listening since Sounding the Seventh Trumpet and Waking the Fallen is my favorite. This cd is a pretty good mix of COE and Waking the Fallen. The mix is hard and heavy , yet clear , and Shadows voice (on most tracks) is not too grating. Nightmare has a great hook and tons of great drumming and riffs. Buried Alive is very Metallica -ish with great solo work but Shadows voice begins to grate a bit. Welcome to The Family is one of my faves on this album , REALLY great hook and Shadows sounds good here. It seems when he stays within his lower vocal range his voice sounds way better. \\"God Hates Us\\" is great , I was shocked to hear how well Shadows can still scream and his voice sounds great  here. Heaviest song on the album by far. Fiction is the last song the Rev wrote , and his singing can be heard on it. It's a good song but takes some getting used to. Save me is a great long ,almost instrumental. I also like Natural Born Killer and Tonight the World Dies. The weak tracks are Danger Line (sounds contrived and lazy , almost sounds like a Self Titled B-side) , So Far Away , and Victim. But all in all this is the best thing they've released since Waking the Fallen.
0439023513|5.0|I will first say that I love the hungers games novels! Each one was better than the last. This book surprised me. It was very graphic and real. The way it was written made me feel so much like I was Katniss. I felt her pain. It was a very bittersweet novel. Some of the lives lost broke me. I haven't cried so much over a book since Harry Potter! The epilogue was a perfect ending! I left feeling complete with the novel. It was heartbreaking but Katniss finally realized who was most important and found her true self. These books are amazing. Definately one of the best book series out there!!! ***I am so glad she ended up with the right guy!!! I was very happy!***

B0036EH3X4|5.0|Everyone is dead? I'm just not sure if I've been watching dead people from day one. What a great six years it has been. Many feel disappointed at the finale and I was too, at first. However, the writers must have considered many possible endings and this seemed the most appropriate. Perhaps it lacked imagination, but I must agree with those who feel it was a finale that was filled with emotion. The cast gave some of their finest performances; I liked seeing key ghosts from past episodes return, especially Shannon, Juliet, and Libby. This season gave us 17 episodes, including the extended finale. Many puzzles were resolved, a few mysteries revealed, some new questions surfaced. I don't quite accept the title of the finale as 'the end'. With the complete LOST saga on DVD, I'm going back to the beginning.

1401310400|1.0|First off, I am a dedicated Richard Castle fan who can't wait for Wednesday to get my weekly Castle fix. So when I found a Richard Castle book, I couldn't wait to read it. But It's impossible to read. I can't believe any publisher would use print that small (6 or 7 pt. type?) and expect serious sales. As much as I like Castle, I had to give up reading it.
B000003FD9|5.0|This is a recording made after a lifetime by a virtuoso searching for the inner poetry in Bach... a successful search.  Listen to this set of Bach's solo cello concerto's alongside Yo Yo Ma's -- so different that you can't believe they're the same compositions.
0439023513|5.0|This is going to be a very unconventional review (really more of a rambling than a review) filled with spoilers so beware!<br /><br />Honestly, I don't know what to say. After reading the first two installments of this trilogy can you really expect anything but greatness? No. But I must say that Collins still had some surprises up her sleeve. I really had no idea how this book was going to pan out. I knew there would be war and rebellion, but I never envisioned it happening they way it did.<br /><br />District 13 was nothing like I imagined. I pictured a republic. Something that resembles our way of life. I don't know why I was thinking that. The people in Katniss's world have never experienced freedom. But I wasn't expecting the rigid schedules and rules of Thirteen. I also loved the introduction of President Coin as another suspicious character. As if there weren't enough things to worry about! I all worked perfectly, though.<br /><br />I felt that the love triangle really took a back seat ride in this one. Which is the way it should be. Mockingjay was about the rebellion. It came first. Not teenage love. It was in the back of my mind the entire time, though. I've said it 1 million times, but Suzanne Collins is a genius. The obstacles she threw at these three characters, but mostly Katniss and Peeta, were incredibly horrifying. I couldn't see a resolution for them at all and I was left guessing until almost the end who Katniss would choose. It was always Peeta. There's no way Collins could have chosen Gale for her. They weren't meant to be. Although, I think Gale fans will be outraged at the abrupt dismissal of him. That's the way it felt to me, anyway, and I'm team Peeta.<br /><br />The whole ending in general seemed a bit abrupt to me, but after putting some thought into it, I don't see how it could have ended any other way. Katniss made some decisions that were completely out of character for her in the last 100 pages, but I think by this point she was so ready for everything to end that she just didn't care. Yes, it was tidy, but I think of all the fictional characters in the world, these needed a happy ending, or as happy as they could get. They were almost damaged beyond repair, so I think the ending was fitting. The epilogue left me with a warm fuzzy feeling, actually, the end of the last chapter left me grinning like an idiot through my tears!<br /><br />This trilogy is an instant classic.

B002VPE1B6|2.0|This movie is a derivation of everything you've ever seen before.    Avatar=Alien (with Sig. Weaver)+Star Wars 1(with blue but less annoying race of Jar Jar Binks)+Harry Potter(flying dragons)+Disney movies (over saturated color and animation)+Top Gun (what's with the US Marine's schtick in all these invade-um movies anyway?)    Okay Mr. Cameron, I see that you are getting really good with computer animation....I get it (hence the additional star in the rating).      The problem is that I sat there fore 2 hours, THINKING that I was watching computer animation.    I'm off to see the Hurt Locker now....atleast there will be a decent story.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|Obviously Shawshank is the best movie of all time--or at least of the 90s.  No surprises here.  I owned the VHS forever and thought it was time to upgrade.  Can't speak to the bonus features, since I generally ignore all the extra content--just give me the movie.  Biggest tragedy: Shawshank lost Best Picture to that overblown piece of fluff, Forrest Gump!  Great price!  Can't believe I waited so long to upgrade!
B002ZB26AO|5.0|'Nothing to Envy' blends compelling stories of individuals and their families in the world's worst gulag with a political and economic context that is hard for most of us to imagine    I have followed the development of emerging markets and the transformation of post-communist era socioeconomic systems for much of my professional life, and every once in a while, have had the privilege of learning more about the lives of individuals who had to live in such societies. Nothing to Envy is a masterpiece that accomplishes many objectives simultaneously    Barbara Demick's many years of interviews of North Korean defectors provided the foundation to write such a credible story, and her mastery of language brings the stories of their lives to us in ways that we can at least try to understand what has been happening in North Korea. I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in what happens in totalitarian states, and how the human spirit continues to thrive against the odds    I am looking forward to the day when the human tragedy of countries like North Korea is relegated to the history books    In the meantime, I have become an avid reader of Barbara Demick's columns from Beijing with the LA Times, wondering what next masterpieces she may be working on now!

B000059H98|3.0|While I absolutely love this movie, it is absolute trash when compared to the comic. If you're a fan of the comic, you'll probably want to skip this movie entirely. This is Tank Girl in almost name only. Entire characters have been re-imagined for this movie, with poor Booga getting the worst treatment of all: he goes from being a character of normal intelligence to being a simpleton.<br /><br />The movie has Rebecca (AKA Tank Girl) going after a super company named Water & Power, as well as its evil leader Kesslee. Why? Because he destroyed her home, killed her boyfriend, kidnapped her friend, & tried to brainwash her into joining him. While she's in prison she meets the shy Jet Girl & together they end up eventually joining forces with the mythical Rippers to save TG's friend & end Kesslee's reign of terror.<br /><br />Well... like I said initially, when you compare this to the dynamics of the comics, this is a terrible movie. Plots are inserted, characters are changed, & some characters are left out entirely. You'd be better off distancing yourself entirely from the original source material if you decide to watch this film. Forget the title of the film & call it something else. You're not finding real Tank Girl here. In this aspect, the film is absolutely horrible.<br /><br />As far as camp value goes, the movie is pretty darn good. While this movie isn't really all that good by most movie standards, it does manage to have a fun feel to it & it's a good if you want to see something & turn your brain off. This film just goes over the top in just about everything it tries to do & if not for that, this film would have been a great deal more unwatchable for me. For many the best parts of the film would be the animated & comic sequences, as they were for me. However, where the film fell apart for me is towards the end. It's animated, which is fun, but it doesn't really give the viewer any real sense of what is going on. It's like someone wrote it while they were on an acid trip. Then again, it is still better than the alternate Sub Girl ending, which is painfully acted, paced, & plotted. (I saw it via a youtube clip.)<br /><br />Overall this film is going to be one of those movies you either love or you hate. I love it, especially since it introduced me to the far superior comics, but I can see where I'd have hated it if I'd read the comics first. That's why I'm giving this a 3 star rating- although I'd have given it a 4 or 5 star rating in my teens, it just didn't age well with me. This is a rental.

B000P0J0EW|5.0|Stephen King is one of my favorite authors, and of all of his stories translated into a movie, SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION probably ranks among the best. The casting is top notch, the direction almost flawless, and the musical score superb, and despite the errors in continuity listed below, this film remains one of Hollywood's best of all time. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are two my favorite actors and this film brings out their best.<br /><br />As I noted in my review of THINNER, generally Stephen King's stories do not translate well to film. Notable exceptions are GREEN MILE, SHAWSHANK, and STAND BY ME.<br /><br />SHAWSHANK is a tale of the triumph of the human spirit in a situation when an innocent man's humanity is trampled down with no hope for redemption or escape.<br /><br />Andy Dufresne, a bank president, is found guilty of the murder of his adulterous wife and her lover, a crime revealed late in the film, to have been committed by another man, a hardened criminal. But this is only discovered after Andy has already served 20 years of a life sentence.<br /><br />Andy arrives at Maine's notorious Shawshank prison in the late 1940s and is almost immediately singled out for abuse by one of its worst convicts and his pals who use Andy for their sexual satisfaction. But Andy also makes some good friends among the inmates, most important of which is Ellis Boyd \\"Red\\" Redding [Morgan Freeman], who is also serving a life sentence.<br /><br />While on a work detail, Andy manages to use his financial knowledge to help the prison guards with their taxes and money matters. He also gains a position as assistant to the prison librarian, Brooks Hatlen [James Whitmore]. But he is also later recruited by Warden Norton in a money laundering scheme in which Norton swindles the prison and the state of Maine out of thousands of dollars.<br /><br />Due to these beneficial connections, Andy is saved from further abuse by the sexual predators when the guards beat their leader into a state of brain damage leading to quadrapalegic paralysis.<br /><br />Andy is never able to prove his innocence but he does devise an ingenious plan of successful escape from Shawshank after which he is reunited with his fellow convict, Red.<br /><br />I originally saw this movie when it came out in the 1990s and was not able to remember some of the important details. But the movie was shot in Ashland, Ohio and Mansfield, Ohio. Mansfield is the home of my significant other and we toured many of the shot locations including the Ohio State Reformatory at Mansfield where much of the prison footage was filmed. Because I couldn't remember details of the film and because I wanted to write this review, I bought a copy of the movie on DVD from Amazon at the surprisingly low price of about $5.<br /><br />By all means. if you haven't ever seen this classic, rent it or buy it. And if you have seen it once, see it again and remember how wonderful it is.<br /><br />This and other movie reviews can be found on my website at [...]lysis.

B00275EGWY|2.0|seen many war movies and this is not one of the better ones. it is still watchable with a fairly original theme about bomb squads. the movie is slow at times and what kept my attention are the various bomb situations. character development was ok but i don't really feel like rooting for any of the main characters. the most convincing scene is the first few minutes with guy pearce.    for me, this won't hold up to classics like 'das boot', 'braveheart', 'thin red line', 'platoon', 'last samurai', 'flags of our fathers', 'we were soldiers' etc
B001EN71CW|5.0|Firefly is a show that can grow on just about anyone immediately. This Blu-ray also looks very good. A great investment!
B00006CXSS|5.0|I am not a vet but I appreciate everything our soldiers do for us, politics aside.    This is an amazing video that follows a group of soldiers from D-Day to the end of the war in Europe.  The script is wonderful and the actors perfectly cast.    We need to make sure that our kids and their kids don't forget what our vets do for us.
0439023513|4.0|I can say this: Collins has a knack for creating characters and a storyline that you care about. This book was emotional, it was well written, and I engulfed it all in one sitting. If it wasn't good, I couldn't have devoured it in under seven hours. That being said, no one creation is PERFECT in every way and, yes, this book does have it's shortcomings.     Firstly, those concerned with the level of violence in this book really need to take it's context into consideration. Collins writes about a war zone -- Katniss is in the middle of a huge rebellion! The violence never unsettled me so much so that I couldn't continue reading, and I felt it was appropriate given the circumstances. Katniss' world has fallen apart, her home is obliterated, and her life is in shambles. For that reason, I don't equate her actions in \\"Mockingjay\\" as \\"weak\\" or consider her a shell of the character she used to be. I actually thought she handled the chaos quite well, and for those comparing her to Bella in Meyer's \\"Twilight\\" series obviously have no idea what they're talking about.     However, like I said, no story is perfect. The only major flaw I find with the book is Prim's death. I suppose my problem stems from a lack of understanding WHY it needed to be done. When events happen in a novel, I like to believe they do so for specific reasons. The reason Katniss sparks this entire series of events is to save her sister from the Hunger Games, where cause and effect take over, and each event leads up to the final installment of \\"Mockingjay\\". Killing Prim when Katniss had to suffer in so many other ways throughout the novel seemed unnecessary. I'm all for making characters suffer in order to grow by the end of a series, but she suffered so much already.    This book, in my opinion, is worth the read to see how Collins' wraps up the lives of the characters. I will admit, however, that the ending is realistic. It doesn't attempt to wrap up events with a perfect bow and red ribbons, or make you believe that the character's lived \\"happily ever after\\". If anything, it leaves you with the understanding that some wounds go deep, and never truly heal -- they may only fade overtime while life resumes a sense of normalcy.
B0000024W3|3.0|I have kept from getting this CD because of the negative reviews it has had for 40 years.<br />However I finally got it and found there are indeed some really awful tracks such as The Boxer and All The Tired Horses and a few other very ordinary tracks.<br /><br />However there are some extremely brilliant tracks such as my fav It Hurts Me Too.<br />Copper Kettle & Days Of 49 are some other great Dylan songs.<br /><br />Self Portrait contains Blues, Country, Gospel and folk music and even 4 'Live' tracks from Isle Of Wight 1969.<br /><br />There are other hidden gems that deserve listening to.<br />I prefer this CD to another recorded at the same time New Morning.<br /><br />Give it a go and enjoy some great Bob songs.
B003X73QA8|4.0|Allegedly a song cycle that came together after various band members either visited or heard from the areas they grew up, \\"The Suburbs\\" is Arcade Fire's love-hate letter to nostalgia, decay and growth, growing up and the hazy nostalgia of being young in a small town. It's a pretty good series of songs, and more straight-forward than \\"Neon Bible.\\"<br /><br />There's also a decidedly folkier edge to the music this time around, especially in the title track and the epic \\"Sprawl II.\\" However, there are still times when the dense rock that built the band's reputation. The punkish \\"Ready To Start\\" may be the most propulsive song AF has ever recorded, and the ever present Springsteen influence reigns over \\"City With No Children.\\" The blend of songs is pretty incredible, as fairly soon afterward is the poppish lament of \\"Wasted Hours,\\" reminiscent of The Band, and the most acerbic lyric of the whole album.<br /><br />\\"The Suburbs\\" is a complex and rich album, yet Arcade Fire's most direct. When Wim sadly describes \\"kids and buses still waiting to be free,\\" it cuts as hard as anything off \\"Funeral\\" ever did for me. I may find \\"Funeral\\" to remain their best album, but \\"The Suburbs\\" is maybe even more universal. One of the year's best.
0061120081|5.0|I had a bad upbringing, as far as reading went. Most of my teachers let me read whatever they wanted, and the few that assigned anything to me took the path of the-most-boring-is-best. I therefore was made to read \\"1984\\", which was over my 14-year-old head, and \\"Silas Marner\\", which the whole class thought was boring and badly written. In the last few years I've been slowly catching up with those classics I should have read when I was younger. I tried Scott Fitzgerald (and decided after \\"The Great Gatsby\\"--which I liked--not to venture any further), \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" which I expected to hate and liked anyway, \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" which had me rolling in the aisles, and even Jane Austen, who I enjoyed a great deal more than I expected. Now I turn to \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". It's one of those books that everyone but me has apparently read. So I guess it's time I caught up with everyone else.    Janet Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch is a little girl, during the events of the story. I got the impression that the author was imagining Scout as a slightly older girl, writing this story down for posterity. She has an older brother, and the two of them live with their father, a lawyer, in a small town in Alabama. Their mother's dead. In the summer, a cousin named Dill visits them and the three of them play together. Supposedly, Dill is based on Harper Lee's real childhood friend, Truman Capote, but that's neither here nor there. They are the typical rural children of the era, playing in the street, and spreading rumors and innuendo about their neighbors. At the end of the block there's a strange family with a reclusive son who's in his thirties, but never leaves the house or says anything to anyone, named Boo Radley.    Scout knows her father's a lawyer, and has knowledge of a few things with regards to laws, but she's never really experienced a trial or anything. A third of the way into the book, when you're wondering if it's ever going to really have a plot, kids start tocall Scout's father a n----r-lover. Ms. Lee doesn't bother with the hyphens. It turns out that what they're referring to is the fact that Scout's dad, whose name is Atticus Finch, has been assigned to defend a local black man who has been accused of raping a white woman. In Alabama in the 1930's, this is a capitol offense, and he'll surely be executed if he's convicted.    So of course there's the obligatory lynch mob (one of the strongest scenes in the book) where Atticus faces down the less-than-brilliant citizens of the town, followed by the courtroom scene that's rather short, given that the trial of course only takes one day. I won't give away the ending, but the author confronts the obvious issues of racism and class in the 1930's south with a great deal more subtlety and nuance than I expected, and the ending, if a bit surprising, is also very satisfying.    I do have one negative thing to say about this book: it killed the career of what could have been a great novelist. At least that's my opinion. Most any author wants to think the book they're working on is better than the last one they wrote, and this thing won pretty much every award it could, short of the Nobel Prize for literature. It's one of the best-loved books of the last century. It's my belief that this success was a double-edged sword: on the one hand the acclaim was probably pretty heady, but on the other hand, how do you top something as successful as this? It's almost inevitable that a second book wouldn't win another Pulitzer. Anything less would be a step down.    Nevertheless, this is a wonderful book, truly great, and I recommend it highly.
B002VPE1X4|5.0|Based on other customers' feedback, the hard cases available on Amazon that claim to fit the Panasonic Lumix ZS7 don't in fact fit.  This one, while soft, fits the ZS7 well and it seems to provide adequate protection.  It has enough space in the secondary pocket for a spare battery (and probably would fit an additional memory card), but not the charger.

B00081MUY0|4.0|Sunshine Superman is one of my favorite Donovan CDs and is probably the one I play the most. There is not a dud track on the CD and the bonus tracks are consistent with the main portion of the album.<br /><br />Season Of The Witch is one of his best songs and was covered by Steven Stills & Al Kooper on 1968.<br />Legend of a girl child Linda is my favorite track on the CD, it's a beautiful balad that has contains strings and great lyrics about his then girlfriend Linda Lawrence who became a lifelong partner of Donovan.
0143038419|5.0|I loved reading this book...I was done with Italy and was so eager to read more.  I watched the movie...umm okay...kinda blah.  I love Julia Roberts.  And yes I was REALLY looking forward to the movie cause I was in the middle of book, and I was enjoying it.  But didn't read the book for two weeks after.   I finished it and I am glad I did.  The book gave the authors wit and the movie only did samples here and there.  So if you are a \\"relaxed reader\\" like me, this book is nice to read, the movie, not so much. Sorry Julia! I still love you but LISS (came more real in the book than on the screen :)
B002SF9YUM|5.0|I'm prejudice because I love Rob Pattinson but his portrayal of Salvador Dali is remarkable.  I've watched this movie more than 10 times because the story is beautiful and inspiring.  Lorca and Dali are perhaps one of history's greatest secret and forbidden love stories.  This movie is written and directed with passion and homage to two genius's of the 20th century.  Both have left a legacy of masterpieces of their work.  I've awakened my love of poetry and art thanks to this lovely film.  It comes at a time in my life when I can finally appreciate such things.  I'll be following Rob's career, but so far, this one is his riskiest and bravest works yet.  This adorable vampire has a great range for acting.   I'll be keeping close watch for him, till my heart stops beating!
030726999X|1.0|Hornet's Nest was BORING and VERY disappointing.  Don't waste your money!  I loved the first 2 books, but found this book just had too many peripheral characters that I could care less about.  I wanted to hear more about Salander and Blomkvist.

B0007PAMR4|5.0|David Lynch's take on Dune is nothing short of pretty darn good. It definitely gets weird (a.k.a. David Lynch-esque) in places, but overall the feel and tone of the movie are wonderful. The extended addition is definitely superior to the original theatrical version. A great prologue and many added scenes help those who have not read the book understand this complicated story much better.
B000W7JWUA|1.0|I have bought this game as a present to my husband. It came in, brand new, no problems from the outside.    When his birthday came, we opened it. Three of the crucial parts of the board was missing. Amazon has refused to take the faulty item back, because more than 30 days has passed since the day of the purchase.    BOTTOM LINE: the game itself is excellent and I love it. CAUTION: to avoid disappointment, open it and check it even if you are planning to give it as a present
030726999X|5.0|Given the plethora of rave reviews for this book, I scarcely need to add my voice to the chorus. However, my perspective may be slightly different in that I already loved Scandinavian crime fiction when I started reading this series, so the genre wasn't a revelation for me. And I still haven't read the first book, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (though I have seen the movie).<br /><br />When I read The Girl Who Played with Fire, I enjoyed it, but felt at something of a disadvantage because I didn't know the back story from the first book. (I had received a review copy.) And while Larsson filled in some of the blanks, it wasn't enough to flesh out the characters and their motivations. He clearly intended for the books to be read in sequence.<br /><br />This time, however, I knew enough of the back story to enjoy The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest without reservation. Yes, it's long, and yes, the plot is convoluted and the characters numerous, but it drew me in from the first few pages, and I literally couldn't put it down, often staying up way too late reading just a little more. By the end I was savoring the last few pages, knowing it was the last of Larsson's books I would be able to enjoy.<br /><br />All in all, it was a very satisfying end to the saga of Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomqvist. Wonderful intelligent, escapist fiction.<br /><br />Now I have to go back and read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|What a wonderful book!  Written in the first person by a dog (Enzo), he tells his own life story as well as that of his human family (Denny, Eve, and Zoe). Enzo so wants to be a human being, with a human tongue so he can talk and human thumbs so he can shake hands.  He wants to engage and participate in human life, not just observe.  He does believe he has a human soul and that he will come back in his next life as a man.    The characters in this book are well-developed and believable.  And you just can't help but love Enzo.  The love between Enzo and Denny especially but also between Enzo and the other family members is beautifully portrayed.  The story has highs and lows, pain and happiness, hopes and dreams, and love and death.  The book was well-written, easy to read and understand, and well-formatted for the Kindle. This was an entertaining, emotional, worthwhile read which I highly recommend.
158270208X|4.0|I wasn't quite sure what it would be but I knew I needed a gratitude book to change my day to day life.  It has little gratitude pearls of wisdom on every page and definitely having the space to write what I am grateful for starts every day off on the right track. It also helps me to draw good things to myself.
0439023513|4.0|This book is absolutely shattering. In the Hunger Games trilogy the government uses a uniquely horrifying method to quell any hint of dissent. However, in the first two books this Survivor-meets-Gladiator concept is handled with a relatively light touch, rather like the way the Nazis are portrayed in the Indiana Jones movies - menacing, to be sure, but not personally threatening to the audience. By the time we get to Mockingjay, however, we are dealing with material that feels much more like Schindler's List than Indiana Jones. The darkness is unremitting, those who claim to be rescuing us end up being just as evil as the ones we're escaping, and we feel Katniss's despair as our own. In the end, after losing the sister she was prepared to die to save, Katniss manages once again to find the only move available to prove she's no pawn in someone's else game, but the cost both to her and to us has been so heavy that it's difficult to rejoice. We're given an ending that shows us all is not lost, that Katniss and Peeta can still ignite in each other a better kind of fire, but we're not really allowed to celebrate their reunion, just to see it. Good book? Yes, definitely, but tough to take. Bring your own hope, 'cause there isn't any here.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Watch these movie over and over loved it. Great casting and story line.  The special features on the actors was fun.  If you love Sci-Fi this has to be in your library...
1849162743|5.0|From the time I ordered this book until it arrived was 4 weeks.  I know the book will be good.<br />I am still reading the second book which was ordered at the same time and arrived in 4 days.  I can't imagine what took so long!!!
B002U0KHMY|5.0|One of the best shows I have seen. Great quality and great extras. The gag reel was so funny, my daughter and I couldn't stop laughing. The chemistry between the two leading characters is awesome.The other supporting characters are just as good. We have watched this DVD about three times already. That is how good it is. We recommend it to whoever likes a good caper and to see a relationship blossom into a great friendship.
0439023513|5.0|Katniss made it out of the Games alive for a second time, but the Games won't really be over until the Capitol is defeated. She has to deal with the loss of her home, her friends and more importantly Peeta who's been taken by the Capitol and probably tortured as she is being patched up by district 13 medics. Barely hanging onto her sanity, she will have to step up her game and raise the crowds in hopes of removing President Snow from his dictatorship.<br /><br />There is a lot of controversy around the final installment in the series, I read that many were disappointed and I think I know why. Suzanne Collins isn't into sugarcoating. Mockingjay is raw, cruel, tragic, heart-breaking, violent, sad, utterly amazing and BALSY. The whole story is bittersweet, so everyone hoping for a walk-in-the-park happy ending (have they read the same first two books as me to hope that?) will be baffled.<br /><br />Collins writes her story with such intensity that it's sometimes hard to bare. The desperation Katniss and especially Finnick live are described so perfectly that you find yourself locked in the feeling. I have to admit I cried in more than one occasion. So many tragic events happens, and none of which I expected. When I finished the book I found myself wondering how an author can kill so many important characters and still make it work.<br /><br />I loved every pages of this book and I'm sad it's the last one. The end was powerful and the epilogue brought a bit of much needed closure.<br /><br />I most definitely recommend this series to everyone, young and adults alike. It's not my usual kind of read but I fell for it heals over head. Suzanne Collins is a genius and I can't wait to see what her next project will be!

0439023513|1.0|So many reviews, so many differences of opinions on why SC wrote the book the way she did. I'm not giving a synopis, as so many have already been given. I just wanted to post my opinion. Me, my husband, my daughter and her fiance have all read the series (LOVED the first two books!) and each of us, at the end of this last book, agreed that it was a MAJOR disapointment. From beginning to end, it is totally unrelenting in a mire of hopelessness and despair. After reading the epilogue, I burst into tears and sobbed for a half hour.  It left me completely depressed.  Who wants to re-read a book that is that depressing?! I certainly won't.
B003EYVXSC|3.0|I love [[ASIN:B000068QKT Am&eacute;lie]].  No surprise there.  Everyone does (#47 on IMDb Top 250 as I write this review).  What made Am&eacute;lie work in my opinion: writer/director Jean-Pierre Jeunet's zany creativeness + the audience's universal love for Audrey Tautou's Audrey Hepburn-esque title character.  I liked [[ASIN:B0007Z0NYQ A Very Long Engagement]] for much the same reason.  In both, Jeunet balanced his wizardry with story and character development.<br /><br />By comparison, Micmacs is Jeunet's full-out world of secret hidden lairs, Rube Goldberg-like contraptions and near-Benny Hill-style slapstick (you can all but hum 'Yakety Sax' at some points).  Ostensibly a comedy, it generated very few (if any) laughs at the near-to-capacity showing we attended.  I think the reason is that Jeunet plays it shallow and quick on character development here.  I know we're meant to sympathize with Dany Boon's Bazil as he and his mates carry out their intricately plotted revenge, but I wasn't compelled to work up any feeling at all.  Jeunet was too busy shooting guys out of cannons.<br /><br />Two things I did like: Dominique Pinon's presence (the guy just brings a smile to my face); and the business war between rival ammunition executives portrayed by Nicolas Mari&eacute; and Andr&eacute; Dussollier.  Mari&eacute; is especially good as the suave, new-age weapons provider with his cutting-edge fashion specs, sharp dress, decked-out bachelor pad, art collection and prominently displayed assortment of sports cars.  He's the best single thing in this movie.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This is actually my first gaming headset. I was a semi-audiophile before, owing hd650 k701 and ra1 and the proper amps for them. That being said, I do not expect this pair of headset provide me good sound quality. However, the programmable keys are so convenient. Plus, locating is great! It actually enhance my gaming performance. Yes!  It is comfortable. I think the wireless part really add to that. Put it on, and you are free to go!
0439023513|5.0|I see all these bad reviews and they all highlight a theme of mixed feelings, disappointment, disturbing ending, etc. To me, that is what is fabulous about this book. How can the third book have ended any other way? I didn't expect what Collins did, but MY GOD it was brilliant. My first feeling when I was done was actually being upset. I was disturbed and sad and totally emotionally spent. At this point if I had written my review, I would not have given it 5 stars. That's why I understand where the low reviews came from.     But as I began to process everything I'd just read and went back to sections that disturbed me or upset me. And then once again, going over the conclusion. It hit me. Wow. It took me going back to recognize how brilliant it all was. How it all played so brilliantly together. I don't want to put in any spoilers, but I do believe that there could be no other way for this series to have ended and I'm in awe of Collins writing.
B000002J1L|4.0|Though it may not be as brilliantly concise as what was to follow, make no mistake an earlier, grimier incarnation at this point was nearly as threateningly memorable.
0525951113|5.0|Daniel Suarez does something amazing with Daemon.  He takes everyday tech and slowly builds it to something futuristic and amazing.  The story is riveting and all-to plausible in today's world.  Daemon enmeshes the reader in a reality very close to our own and lets us see the possibilities we are approaching.    This is a very technologically centered work, however, the author presents it such that you don't need an engineering degree to understand.  This work is \\"designed to be comprehensible to all people on earth, regardless of technological level or cultural background\\".  I feel that Mr. Suarez really excelled in this area.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Basically, the first book was amazing, the second a bridge between the first and the third, and this last book was only okay. Katniss is difficult to relate to, as she doesn't actually DO much of anything, besides whine internally about her lack of choices and lack of influence and lack of knowledge. It gets a little repetitive. And the one character you do like, Peeta, becomes almost unrecognizable in this book, and Gale seems almost two-dimensional. It is not a love triangle as the author wished to present - it is the description of relationships falling apart because of the absence of love.   Really, why would they both love Katniss? She is lovable in the first two, but in this one, she just seems self-centered and afraid.   It is entertaining, though, even if it does get a little confusing at times. You should read it if you've read the first two.
0143118420|2.0|In summary:  This is a book about an extremely selfish woman who then proceeds to inflict long-term damage on the men who have the misfortune to love her and expect her to behave like an adult.  Then she gets to write a book about it and make lots of money.  I just cannot have any sympathy for Ms. \\"woe-is-me\\" Gilbert.  I felt more for the men she steamrolled over in her \\"quest.\\"
B000BKVQTS|1.0|Everything is not for everyone proves true as I viewed 'Brothers Grim'.  The film exuded boredom.  The mundane acting by supposedly top actors caused my eyelids to droop.  The film elicited neither excitement nor suspense.  Not one chuckle passed my lips.  If this film were free, it would be overpriced.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Gone is the tough Seam girl who fought her way out of TWO arenas. Gone is the compassionate girl who sang softly to a dying child. Gone is the fighter who wanted to see the senseless killing and the oppression of the Capitol end. What has taken her place is a broken, vacant shell of her former self. There was so little that was recognizable of the Katniss from the previous two novels, that I have to wonder why she was even there at all. If she wasn't hallucinating or drugged up, she was hiding in some secret place where no one could find her. The littlest things would set her back for days, whereas in the arena, she was able to overcome obstacle after obstacle...each worse than the last.<br /><br />I won't be a jerk and fill this review with spoilers...there are plenty of other people here who have seen to that (nice how YOU got to read the book with fresh eyes, yet you saw fit to ruin it for everyone else...and putting SPOILER in big letters, DOESN'T make it okay), but I did feel the need to voice my extreme disappointment with the conclusion of this series. Katniss is built up so much on the first two novels, that I expected her to hit the ground running to extract immediate revenge for the destruction of District 12. I thought she'd be a huge player in the rebellion against the capitol, not the pawn she ended up being. She truly was the Mockingjay...she was fed all kinds of dribble and told what to say and how to act in front of the ever-present cameras, and she repeated it back to Panem like the good little Mockingjay that she was. There was no fire or fight left in her. We may have seen very rare glimpses of it, like when she was thrown into the hell that befell District 8, but more often than not, she was off somewhere whining and complaining. I mean, she wasn't even there for the takeover of the Capitol! She was in a hospital somewhere all drugged up (surprise, surprise)! The conclusion of the take-over had to come to us second-hand...almost as an after-thought! To think, everything these books stand for, all the time invested, lives lost, and people pulling for Katniss, and she wasn't even there. *Sigh* It was just wrong.<br /><br />As for the whole Gale vs. Peeta love triangle...that was just another disappointment. There was never any real confrontation with Katniss and her own self. No sorting out in her mind to determine who she TRULY wanted to be with. The decision was just made for her, and as was par for the course with this book, she just accepted it with very little fight or emotion. I'm wondering why the Epilogue at the end was even included. It was so short and pointless that all it ended up doing was irritating me more.

While they may start off strong and get you 100% invested in the characters, they usually always end up as a crushing disappointment.

Whatever she may write in the future, you can absolutely count me out.ht! To think, everything these books stand for, all the time invested, lives lost, and people pulling for Katniss, and she wasn't even there. *Sigh* It was just wrong.<br /><br />As for the whole Gale vs. Peeta love triangle...that was just another disappointment. There was never any real confrontation with Katniss and her own self. No sorting out in her mind to determine who she TRULY wanted to be with.

0439023513|1.0|I'm not sure what SC was thinking for the last half of this book...??  I think maybe she handed the reins over to her buddy or maybe some coffee shop stranger to finish the book off.  Surely someone who had spent so much time in character development wouldn't just end such a great series in such a rushed/clipped manner.  I'm just left confused and expected a little more bang for the end of this series.
B002M2N9JI|1.0|I was watchin' MTV summer hits the other day and thought this was some crappy 80s video until I saw the name and release date and from there I was instantly hooked! The lyrics are sooooo awesome and the singer is SO indie and original! She makes stupid singers like Doro, Blondie, and Joan Jett look like they smoked too many cigarettes!! I love retro music from the 80s like Milli Vanilli, MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice... this brought back memories!! Who needs JUNK like Blondie or the Cars when you can listen to NEW MTV 80s music!!    I wish we had more music artist like La Roux cuz most of the music from the 80s can't top ANYthing that comes on the MTV or Radio today!

B003OF3R0S|1.0|I've been a long time fan of A7x... they are so heavy and cool and i LOVE wearing tight clothes and finger nail polish like them...!!! Who needs crappy bands like GUns N roses, Pantera, Slayer, Metallica, Emperor, Venom, and Morbid Angel....!!! A7X has killer Jonas Brothers type guitar riffs, blazing fast drumming like that of Korn, and amazing Limp Bizkit type vocals...      But anywho...this is another great fabulous release by the kids in Pink... to bad they didnt include any rap songs nor any remixes with Justin Bieber. I had to take away 4 stars because of that!!      Avoid posers like Overkill, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Savatage, Queensryche, or any of that old music garbage!!!
B00005K3O4|5.0|I love this movie, it is one of the best sci-fi cult classics (or should that be kult Klassics?) to surface from the 80's.  The humor is nerdy, the effects ok and the storyline original.  The opening tune from The Dickies is fun too.  So if you want a film about just what might happen if a space circus came to town, put this on your must see list, who knows it might just push you over the edge enough to run away and join the circus.
B003JTHESA|1.0|Ive been a longtime Maiden fan since their debut the X Factor... but they slowly but surely started to slip away! This album is definitely better than the Iron Maiden demos from the 80s... but it doesn't compare to the Tim Owens era!  Ever since Rob Halford rejoined Iron Maiden they just started to slip away again...Even though this is Iron Maiden.. I still think they don't compare to Lady Gaga or the Jonas Brothers

0618918248|5.0|I'm on page 283 and after a lot of laughing decided that I have to air how much I love this book. I find there are some 1500 comments on it already, but who cares, here's another reason why you should absolutely read this book:    Have you ever wondered, believers and not quite sure half believers, why Richard Dawkins has not yet been struck by lighting, spontaneous combustion or a mysterious mushroom growing in his groins?  I think I know: If there's a god he/she/it just simply didn't have the heart to strike - because this British gentleman is just so hilarious, profound and daring at the same time that I am sure god would protect him because: without Dawkins, Heaven is the most boring place on Earth.   Besides being brilliantly researched and written, this book is truly liberating. There is a lot of courage in that he really counts on humanity to one day liberating itself from religion. This guy truly is a humanist and believes in the better of humankind and inspires this optimism in the reader. It is usually believed that religion is such a strong force that there is no way to ever overcome it, and everyone is tip-toeing around the Eminences and Holinesses and Gurus.  That it is so deeply engrained in our culture, and as Dawkins himself describes, a by-product and result of our adaptations for survival. I also believe that it will take many centuries more, and that there can be big backlashes on the way. But if you read this book you may also realize that things may not be as scary as they are made to look. No one should ever fear to mount resistance and speak up against the reactionaries; we should no longer accept and excuse the anti-democratic and repressive propagandists of the now international Christian Right, or their Jewish friends, or their Muslim evil twins, and forget about all the other self-declared Holinesses. This idea I get from reading this book: The only way we can chase these demons away is with a lot of laughter, fresh air and education. It is a book similar to the ones that you may want to give a child to overcome the fear of monsters, though this is written for adults.  I'm loving it.

0439023513|5.0|I just love the books in this series and I know this is the wrong place to put this review because it is not about the book..it's about AMAZON.COM and the its pre-ordering system. Let me walk through the logic here, I ordered this book in JULY--before it came out. The ONLY reason I pre-ordered it was because i wanted to receive it before many others could. Little did I know, not only would i NOT receive it immediately after the book release date but I would have to wait ALMOST A WEEK to get it. Seriously? Why would I need to pre-order it then? It doesn't even make sense to pay the same price for the book that is selling in stores and not even get it.    Ridiculous.    On another note, I love the book.
0307386171|4.0|this was my first shot at a McEwan book and though it wasn't what i was expecting, i really did enjoy it.  i honestly don't know what i was expecting, but this wasn't it! but, the crispness of the writing style and his wry and dry sense of humor had me hooked early and i'll definitely be giving his other books a try.<br /><br />set in the early 1960's on the wedding night of Edward and Florence, we follow the split narration of the newlyweds in their growing anxiety regarding the consummation of their wedding.  Edward has the expected anticipation of his first performance and Florence is absolutely horrified with the idea, yet willing to try to be the dutiful wife that she knows she must be.  at times hilarious and other times aching with the sadness that can only come when you really don't know your partner all that well, this is a rather perverse attempt at sexual education that i'm glad i read.  layered throughout, is also the mirroring of postwar Britain, in all its glory.<br /><br />the characters were not likable and i don't think that was ever the intention.  they are both entirely self absorbed and by getting to hear their inner monologue, we can see how very little they know about themselves and each other.  but, really, isn't this still the case in very young couples?  the often graphic descriptions of the impending sexual encounter may be too much for some readers, either disgusting or crude, but i thought it served to provide enough shock factor and entertainment to be highly readable.  but, i can see how some might disagree...<br /><br />\\"All she had needed was the certainty of his love, and his reassurance that there was no hurry when a lifetime lay ahead of them.\\"<br /><br />the writing style was everything i could have hoped for and more.  McEwan has a way of making sentences and phrases flow so effortlessly and it's beautiful to read (or listen to, as was my case).  i can definitely see how, given a book of more depth, that his writing could be absolutely magnetic and i can't wait to pick up his other books.  that being said, i was absolutely amazed at the depth and complexity of this tiny little book and was wholly impressed with McEwan's ability to capture the essence of time and space in such a small space of his own.<br /><br />\\"But it was too interesting, too new, too flattering, too deeply comforting to resist, it was a liberation to be in love and say so.\\"<br /><br />the audio was wonderful! the production was excellent and hearing the reading in McEwan's own voice really added to the book for me.  had i read the book, it would have been in my American voice (obviously) and hearing it in his lovely British accent really added to that essence of time and space that i mentioned earlier.  i would definitely recommend this to anyone interested.it to pick up his other books.  that being said, i was absolutely amazed at the depth and complexity of this tiny little book and was wholly impressed with McEwan's ability to capture the essence of time and space in such a small space of his own.    \\"But it was too interesting, too new, too flattering, too deeply comforting to resist, it was a liberation to be in love and say so.\\"    the audio was wonderful! the production was excellent and hearing the reading in McEwan's own voice really added to the book for me.  had i read the book, it would have been in my American voice (obviously) and hearing it in his lovely British accent really added to that essence of time and space that i mentioned earlier.  i would definitely recommend this to anyone interested.

B003XU02QG|2.0|'Centurion'- starring Dominic West (The Wire), Michael Fassbender (300, Inglorious Basterds) and Olga Kurylenko (Hitman, Quantum of Solace)- is the latest sandal not-so-epic offered up to the masses and it won't surprise me if most of 'em slap it down.  I wanted to like it more than I did, but it just wouldn't let me.  The film is loosely based upon the fractional myth of the Ninth Roman Legion, believed to have disappeared en route to their new garrison in 117 AD.  Based upon events lacking any real substantive material it takes that germ of an idea and bloats it into something almost unrecognizable.  Half-baked story ideas, clich&eacute;d plotlines and unsupportable actions taken by characters drag the whole thing down into the blood-soaked mud.<br /><br />The movie opens with Centurion Quintus Dias (Fassbender) fleeing his captors across the snowy northland.  Flashbacks introduce us to his predicament: two weeks earlier his garrison was overrun and he was spared only because he spoke the Pictish language.  After some rough interrogation by Pictish king Gorlacon he escapes and is rescued by the Ninth Legion during their march.  The Ninth is commanded by General Titus Flavius Virilus (West), a man respected and beloved as much for his tactical leadership as his rowdiness.  Orders come in from the military governor, who feels Britain is lost but needs a victory to grease his way back to Rome.  Out of the blue the governor provides the general with Etain (Kurylenko), a legendary Pictish scout who can literally track anything.  I'm guessing this skill is based upon the anecdote that losing one sense sharpens the others- her tongue was cut out by legionnaires when she was a child after they killed her family and abused her (which makes her exactly the sort of person a military governor would place absolute faith in to guide troops along to help subjugate her country).<br /><br />After the inevitable and obvious betrayal- though it was a pretty good battle scene- the seven survivors of the massacre, including Centurion Quintus Dias, learn that their general was captured and taken to where Quintus was being held.  They follow in an attempt to rescue him but fail, and one of the group manages to kill Gorlacon's young son in the process.  Now the survivors must evade a band of vengeance-fueled hunters led by Etain as they try to get back to Roman lines.  The hardships of the journey both strengthen their bonds and shows the cracks in their unity.  Etain drives her prey hard, whittling down their numbers and inadvertently forcing them to split up.  Quintus and what's left of his group stagger into a peaceful glade where Arianne, a beautiful young woman with exceptional healing skills, lives a solitary existence (you DO see it coming, right?).  She directs them to a nearby garrison, which turns out to be abandoned, where they're forced to make a stand against Etain and her warriors.  But a few final troubles await the survivors when they finally reach what will eventually become Hadrian's Wall, explaining why the fate of the Ninth Legion became a mystery.<br /><br />It all sounds better than it played out.<br /><br />The biggest failing of the movie is it's just too clich&eacute;d and sometimes just plain dumb, even when not spraying obviously fake CGI blood: Quintus and Etain share some kind of psychic bond- he can feel her rage across the miles- though it's never explained how or why.  The biggest chase sequence is completely stolen from 'Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid'(going across the mountains and the river jump).  The pictish trackers are ordered to bring the Romans' heads back to Gorlacon, yet when one of the soldiers lies wounded they decide to 'just let him bleed' (wtf?)... so you know what comes next.  Arianne has a scar from being marked as a witch by Gorlacon himself- again, why?- thus has no love for 'her people' so is quite willing to host a handsome centurion and his buddies.<br /><br />The other big problem is the somewhat deceptive advertising: billed as the story of the missing legion ala '300', one look at the title tells you different.  This is all Quintus' movie- evidenced by his narration and character focus as well as the fact that the Ninth Legion gets slaughtered about halfway through.  Since that's what it is, that's what it should've been sold as. But it's not a complete washout- this is a harsh, cold, gritty world built upon blood and struggle but also contains some beautiful vistas and scenery.  And both the dialogue and performances are serviceable; everyone holds up their end of the deal.  The fight scenes are sufficiently amputative, but the buttery grease on my fingers was more convincing that the stuff spraying across the screen.<br /><br />This flick could've been a whole lot more than it was, but was never given a chance to.  A real shame given the premise; it might've made for some interesting character studies and storytelling.  I saw it widescreen here in NYC but its also available On-Demand, which is the best way to go; save it for a rainy day in or something.of the missing legion ala '300', one look at the title tells you different.

B003LXM1RS|5.0|A phenomenal collaboration with Stuart Price, who produced Madonna's 'Confessions On A Dance Floor'.  Honestly I have played this CD over and over and over for going on a week now.  It has unmistakable sexual energy, yet never crosses the line in to tacky or needing to be censored.  Although the title track, Night Work (probably intentionally) could easily be used for the opening credits of a gay 80's porno, it is much more refined, electronic, and danceable.  The track \\"A Whole New Way\\" is somehow reminiscent of George Michael's \\"I Want Your Sex\\", while \\"Any Which Way\\" is classic Scissor Sisters'.  If you listen closely you can hear Kylie Minogue on the backing vocals for this track.  Kylie even lent a barely recognizable sample of \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\" to another equally infectious track called \\"Something Like This\\", which oddly enough sounds similar to the 80's band, Laid Back's \\"White Horse\\".  But the track that stands out the most on this body of work would have to be \\"Harder You Get\\".  Edgy, and well, hard, this song demands attention. And the hook is amazing.  If you like songs to listen to loudly and bang your head to, this is it. I call it old Cheap Trick meets Alice Cooper, with a funky guitar solo, and an addictive bass line.  Elements to the musical construction of \\"Running Out\\", I would compare to Devo as well.  And last but not least, \\"Invisible Light\\".  Wow!  Epic.  Just epic.  It's a fine piece of story telling of the ancient city of Babylon, featuring spoken words that Vincent Price would admire.  This is an instant classic.  I give very high marks for this latest body of work from Scissor Sisters.  If you enjoy 70's and 80's synth pop, this is definitely a must have; not only for Scissor Sisters fans, but newcomers to the diversity of this talented group, alike.  Five stars all the way!
B0042816YK|3.0|One quarter of this movie is excellent. The other three quarters is just barely acceptable.<br /><br />The story follows Liz Gilbert from her divorce in New York City, to Rome, to India, and then Bali. The film is pretty well evenly divided twenty five percent to each location. Supposedly, Liz eats in Rome, prays in India, and loves in Bali. I would guess that the book does a wonderful job making these three distinctions at each location. Sadly, the film bungles the division up very badly. Each theme is badly mixed in at each location. A key example from a trailer clip, so I'm not spoiling the film, Felipe is clearly coming on to Liz; they are both attracted to each other. He gives her a tour of a market, and then says they need to eat at the best restaurant in the city. Liz, says yes they do and where is that restaurant? Felipe responds, my house. Eating is a huge portion of the last segment. Oddly, the Rome segment, food had little to do with the motivation of that location (yes there was a horrible close up montage of Liz eating spaghetti, but that had so little to do with the story). The film does a good job with flashbacks, where Liz is reminded of something that happened in New York. Unfortunately, it was sometimes difficult to tell who was Stephen (her ex-husband) and David (her ex-boyfriend).<br /><br />The worst non-sequitur of the film, clearly something had been cut from the film. Liz and many friends make Thanksgiving dinner in Rome. The pack of friends has gotten large, an older woman (somebody's momma), a couple with a baby, the overweight bearded guy coupled with some other woman (but seemed to be headed toward Liz earlier in the film), the Swedish blonde and her Italian language teacher. Liz either makes a toast or does a voice over narration about how fabulous her friends are. How they are powerful people that show the importance of family. Seeing one of the men put their baby to sleep. She is just full of love and admiration for these people. Unfortunately everything leading up to that scene was about Liz more or less partying with some of these friends and being very alone. The toast came completely out of left field, and made absolutely no sense. The film is riddled with these problems.<br /><br />Julia Roberts is perfectly cast and delivers a marvelous performance. I believed completely that Julia had taken this journey; she lived the main character Liz. Javier Bardem (Vicky Christina Barcelona and No Country for Old Men) as Felipe, Liz's final love interest, is incredible. He is sexy Latin without being a caricature (like he was in Vicky Christina), his whole demeanor is attractive to males and females. Richard Jenkins (The Visitor) is the other standout performance. He plays a Texan in an Indian ashram. The best line of the film, \\"Has anyone ever said that you look like James Taylor?\\" There was a very long pause and then the question was repeated. Apparently this is something Jenkins gets in real life all the time. Frankly, the other performances were pretty much cardboard (save the lady assistant at Ketut Liyer house, she is hilarious). The worst was the blonde Swedish woman that spoke perfect English and Italian in Rome.<br /><br />The soundtrack is outstanding, Eddie Vedder wrote two gorgeous acoustic songs that fit so well in this film. It is worth staying for the credits just to hear his closing song. The range is sweet, from Fleetwood Mac to Sly And The Family Stone to Neil Young (two songs). The orchestra music is a whole other beast; it detracted horribly from the film. Opera or classical music is brought up to make the audience feel more touched by the action, the use backfired horribly for me, and it all just slipped into melodrama.<br /><br />This is a very long film; runtime is clocked at 133 minutes. The director could have cut out at least 30 minutes in the first two portions of the film, although they clearly deleted some critical story line component in the Rome sequence. The filming in Rome is very poor; the look and feel is of bad stock travel footage. India is marginally better. Early in that sequence the hackneyed images of crowded dirty India are repeated. Later at the ashram, the cinematography is much better. On the other hand, Bali is simply gorgeous, beautiful exotic images, with excellent camera work.<br /><br />The film is rated PG-13. The f bomb is thrown at least twice. There is a fairly extended scene of completely naked male behind, this is a full body shot and by millimeters didn't show any private parts. Sadly, this particular scene goes on a bit too long. And frankly, Liz laughing so hard at his naked body, she sees the full frontal nudity, is poorly done. Although the eye candy guy does blow off the laughing rather well. Everyone is fully clothed in the bedroom scenes, not even a hint of underwear.<br /><br />This is a review of the theatrical release of the film. The DVD is not yet released. I expect the transfer to DVD will be well done. It's hard to say what bonus features will be added. After over two hours of this, I probably would never watch the bonus features anyway.<br /><br />I really loved the last quarter of this film. My wife and I saw this together; it was a nice afternoon date film. Her comment was, the book was much better, the last quarter really was good, and the rest was not so good. I only say this to balance my male view of the film. My lower rating of this film is not because this is a romantic comedy or a chick flick; it is because the first three quarters lacked motivation.

0439023513|5.0|I know what everyone was expecting with this novel. Katniss picks Gale or Peeta and ya de da beats up Mr Snow and everyone's happy.<br /><br />Wrong<br /><br />Miss Collin's took that idea and destroyed it. This novel obviously was never supposed to be about the romance. This is about war, war in all its gory detail.<br />Many people were not happy because the ending was sad and depressing. Well thats real life people. This is real, happening right now. Our people dying in the enigma called war. War is hell, and that is what Katniss went through.<br /><br />Hell.<br /><br />In the beginning, we see Katniss exploring the charred ruins of District 12, trying to figure out the point of it all. It was obvious with the first descriptions what and how this novel was going to play out. But the detail was incredible and you really could feel the pain and sadness Katniss was going through. the realism of it all, the fact that in a few thousand, if not hundred, years, this same scenario. Us destroying ourselves in this post apocalyptic disaster. That is why this novel is going to win awards that it deserves.<br /><br />I'll admit, the shock of it all was...astounding. i actually found myself sniffling when we are told that Cinna is dead. that was one of the saddest most shocking deaths to me, we all loved Cinna. Then we learn Bonni and Twill have most likely died, we didn't know them all that well but still its saddening.<br /><br />I think that is one of the saddest things in this novel, how the people die but we aren't given the time to mourn because thats just how war is, we don't have the time to worry yet, we just have to keep going.<br />Then later, Peeta being recovered but having that deep hatred of Katniss. its cruel the things poor Katniss must endure. How she didn't go completely insane, though it was obvious she was getting there throughout the story, was a minor miracle.<br />Then how Finnick and Anne finally got to be together and wed. that was one of the novels happier moments. But then his and so many other characters deaths. Bogg's legs getting blown off by a land mine caught me completely off guard but hey, thats war.<br /><br />Then when Katniss is finally arriving, the human shields, the parachutes, and the death of Prim.<br />At that point i was actually in tears, which has never happened to me while reading a book before.<br /><br />The horrible, cruel irony of it all was just so astounding. Katniss did all this to save Prim and now for it all to finally come to its end, Prim had to die.<br /><br />Katniss really did go partially insane after that, or was it the morphling? you are never really that sure. she goes to the garden and finds out from snow that it was all a plot of the Rebels. it was Coins fault Prim was dead.<br /><br />At first, the detail and description that go's into those final moments when Katniss remembers that her and Snow agreed never to lie to each other and knows the truth, and puts an end to coin.<br /><br />Then the novel go's into and almost drug induced state. it speeds along and now that its all over, Katniss is just trying to find a reason to live.<br /><br />But the romance is finally answered in a sad but perfect way when she chooses the also broken Peeta.<br /><br />The Epilogue felt a little quick and sad but it was all they could do. i mean you can't just expect her to be happy and peppy in the end, even 20 years later. She was changed and those memories will stay with her until the day she takes her final breath and joins all the others in that sky over the dark foreboding ocean.deaths.

At first, the detail and description that go's into those final moments when Katniss remembers that her and Snow agreed never to lie to each other and knows the truth, and puts an end to coin.    Then the novel go's into and almost drug induced state. it speeds along and now that its all over, Katniss is just trying to find a reason to live.    But the romance is finally answered in a sad but perfect way when she chooses the also broken Peeta.    The Epilogue felt a little quick and sad but it was all they could do. i mean you can't just expect her to be happy and peppy in the end, even 20 years later. She was changed and those memories will stay with her until the day she takes her final breath and joins all the others in that sky over the dark foreboding ocean.
0316066524|5.0|I picked up Infinite Jest after hearing many favorable comparisons between its author, David Wallace, and Thomas Pynchon, my favorite zany and reclusive author (sorry Salinger!). Reading IJ is a huge commitment; reaching that final page will take for most a minimum of one month, and for most, including myself, it will take several months, but it's completely worth the investment. Summarizing Infinite Jest is a nightmare in theory and in practice doesn't do the book justice: over the period of a few weeks in November, wunderkind Hal Incandenza deals with his personal and familial issues at the Enfield Tennis Academy; reformed burglar and addict Don Gately tries to stay sober in a Boston halfway-house; radical Quebecois terrorists seek an experimental film that reduces viewers to mindless zombies crying for repeat viewings; packs of feral, carnivorous hamsters roam the toxic wastelands of Old New England; a guy named Roy Tony is mentioned once, appears briefly five hundred pages later, and is never heard from again; a brief essay appears out of nowhere to explain the rise and fall of video-telephones, and so on and so forth. Infinite Jest isn't a traditional story with a beginning, middle, and end. Instead, Wallace pulls back the curtain and allows the reader a brief glimpse at his own fictional world full of characters, events, and locations tied together through very elaborate and delicate means that only become apparent as the novel reaches its end. Along the way, the reader becomes acquainted with Wallace's bizarre humor, political satire, 12-step mantras, Boston street-argot (I'm trying to bring \\"demapped\\" and \\"promoted\\" into my vocabulary now), and science fiction that sometimes becomes eerily similar to today (I discovered the joys of Netflix's Instant View features around the time Infinite Jest explained how TP's download content from the internet). The only disappointment with the book is that it eventually does end, and somewhat clumsily as others have whinged about, although the in media res first chapter offers a skeletal road-map to what happened. All whinging aside, for those four months I spent with Infinite Jest, I had a comforting presence on my bookshelf, a brick of words and paragraphs containing an entire world within its pages and end-notes full of beauty, vulgarity, complexity, humor, and pathos.
1844256383|5.0|While it won't repair a repair shop bible, this beautiful book will tell the interested amateur how to care for his/her instrument. What can be done at home, what maintenance does an instrument require, what is best left to the professional technician. It teaches analytic skills that help you find out what exactly is wrong. It tells you what steps are involved in handling a fault (so you can decide if it's for you or rather not). And it tells you about how to these problems with the best results. That's what's so great about all Haynes books - the practical approach, the non-intimidating explanations, the \\"best practices\\" from seasoned technicians. This book is no exception.
B0002YLC24|5.0|To put it succinctly, the greatest things in life you can never get enough of. This is one of those.    Hollywood today is about glorifying the magnificent; magnificent action, magnificent characters, magnificent love. This film is none of those. This is as down to earth as hollywood gets without secretly filming your life. The long steadycam tracking shots; the utterly natural dialogue; the heartbreaking palpability of the characters' barely repressed passion make Before Sunset almost a voyeuristic journey through Paris. And yet, somewhere during the film (during the car ride home for me), this small story of an anonymous passion still managed to become magnificent.     It was in the utter relatability of their interaction that enraptures. We've all spent countless hours in desk-thumping debate on the environment, or crying about the solitude of our romantic fate. So as they go through these stages of conversation it becomes brilliantly easy for viewers to relate and remember such moments they themselves have had. Coupled with that tiny fiction of meeting a dazzling foreigner on a train and spending a night together in Vienna, this movie was heaven; a dreamy almost-reality for those of us that wish for such charming moments in our lives. Watching Sunrise and then Sunset back to back, it killed me that they were in such a constant rush through Paris; that they couldn't spend another day in delightfully inconsequential discourse and liberating entwining of their souls as they did in the first film.     But then again, would that had been the case, that still probably wouldn't have been enough.
0812973992|2.0|Overall, this was a very tediously detailed book. The writing was choppy and abrupt. The audio version was far easier to listen to than it was to read this book, and I tried and put down the book many times. As a concept, bringing together multiple lives under the skies of New York, and tying them all together in time with an event that is now history for New York - the tightrope walker between the then-newly built World Trade Center - is unique.   The book is divided into parts that have different protagonists. McCann has a wonderful, creative imagination and has clearly researched the lives of the various characters he has written about, but the writing is tedious and sometimes overly detailed to the point of dull. The first part [about Corrigan] and the second [about the prostitutes] were lengthy and rambling. The third part about the drugged couple who get into an accident made me sit up and take notice because suddenly the characters' lives overlapped and they became more a cause-and-effect of one another, rather than the apparently disparate lives they were leading. Tilly's chapter was wonderful - the highlight in the book, probably more so because I listened to the audio version of this book and the narration was superb. A couple of chapters and characters seemed to go nowhere, particularly the one about the graffiti photographer, and the computer hackers in Palo Alto. I felt for Adelita - that was another chapter I enjoyed. I did not connect with most of the characters - perhaps Tilly, Gloria and Adelita the most, Corrigan somewhat.  SPOILERS AHEAD...  There were certainly bright moments in the book. I loved how the tightrope walker connects all the characters in time - Tilly's fate only comes into stark attention in Soderberg's courtroom, but he is more interested in the tightrope walker who has been just brought in. I loved how one character is brought to the foreground in Soderberg's mind, but it is the one we as the readers are less interested in, sincewe've come to know Tilly better. Also well done were the hints and suggestions of previous characters in the stories of later characters, without the author telling us who they are e.g. I thought the doorman in Claire's story, because he was Irish, was Ciaran [Corrigan's brother] since he had been contemplating different jobs in New York. Who it was was not revealed, but the memory jog was cleverly done, and I didn't mind not knowing. Elsewhere, the nameless lady who adopted Jazzlyn's girls reminded me of Gloria, without that revelation then. I also thought that the drugged artist who let his paintings wash in the rain was perhaps the subway tunnel graffiti guy, but that was not made clear, and it made the story of the graffiti guy all the more pointless. I appreciated the detailed description about the feeling of the tightrope walker - not so much as the onlookers observing him - but his own feelings, his sense of the wind, the moisture in his eyes, his own balancing act with his body. That was lovely writing.  It is a sad book overall, and the ending could have been less abrupt.
B002L5GQGY|4.0|A friend of mine told me about Joe Bonamassa and how good this concert was. Since I had never heard of him before, I wasn't expecting alot. But this guy is terrific. After watching this concert DVD I immediately went on iTunes and stared buying songs. If you appreciate good guitar work, rock and blues, this is the concert for you. The only negative is the sound is OK at best. I have a really nice home theater with 5.1 surround sound. No matter what setting I used, the sound was OK at best. When I compare this to several Clapton DVDs I have or the Eagles Farwell Tour 1, the sound is dissapointing. But, its not terrible. And the songs and performance are outstanding. This is definitely worth owning.

B000089CJI|4.0|Let me preface this by saying, I'm a huge Ben Gibbard fan and this album delights me fiercely. The album starts out with District Sleeps Alone, which is very catchy. The second Track, Such Great Heights, a cover of Iron and Wine is simply fantastic. The melodic hooks inspire. Nothing Better features Jenny Lewis from Rilo Kiley and her sweet, sultry voice is a delicious match to Ben Gibbard's vocals. This song will have you tapping your fingers to the lyrical beat.   The middle of the album is a bit boring but it gets better towards the end. Sleeping In and Natural Anthem are great songs. If you savor catchy synth pop and want to hark back to the 80's with a new millenium feel, then this is the album you've been searching for. This music sounds good really loud too, I have an amp in my trunk and the bass on District Sleeps Alone rocks my rearview mirror which is delightful.

B000OHZJLY|5.0|This is one that has slipped thru the cracks over time, but at the time it was anything but obscure. Back in the days of LP's, it was on the top of everyones stack in the summer of '82. So I'm surprised to hear it referred to as \\"obscure\\" by listeners who came to E. Costello later on. Very intimate and personal, it seems like a personal soundtrack for any love affair or infatuation one might be having at the time. The production is inventive, with each song approached separately, but still the tracks blend together as a suite. When it was released, it took me awhile to appreciate it, but it continued to unfold for months afterwards. I reccommend giving it the time to do so if you've never heard it. My favorite E.C. recording still.
1597801585|5.0|You will be swept into and away from this intense superbly plotted, challenging, and poetic science fiction novel.  I have been reading science fiction since the early sixties and I rank this novel among my top 25 favorites. A must read.
1601252463|4.0|The APG adds a ton of new options for players, including new base classes, alternate class features for older base classes, new feats, spells, prestige classes, and so on.  There's also new items, magical equipment, and optional rules for groups that want to change things up a little bit.  The best part is that overall they're very well balanced; I could complain that some of the options are a little underpowered, actually, but nothing sticks out to me as being overpowered (certainly nothing comes as close as, say, Candles of Invocation, which are in the core rulebook!).<br /><br />Pathfinder seems to be taking an opposite approach from 3.5 D&D to some class balance issues; in 3.5, most of the base classes were terribly weak beyond the low levels, and there was no reason to not go into prestige classes as soon as possible.  Pathfinder has significantly improved upon the base classes and toned down the prestige classes, to the point that in some cases there is little reason to take levels in a particular prestige class unless you just really like the flavor of it.<br /><br />My most significant complaint is that some of the new options seem redundant.  The oracle, for example, in terms of mechanics is very much like a cleric but just not as good.  The flavor of the class is nice, sure, but flavor and mechanics can be kept separate; there's nothing stopping somebody from putting \\"cleric\\" on their character sheet but dressing up as and calling themselves an oracle in-game.  Summoner has a similar problem in that it's just too similar to the basic wizard class; they have a fun, unique mechanic, but it seems like it could have easy been done as a prestige class for wizards instead.  On the other hand, alchemist, witch, and cavalier are fine classes, even if the cavalier may have difficulty fitting into campaigns that aren't mount-friendly. Inquisitors are a fun concept, but seem mechanically weak; they're jacks-of-all-trades, so they suffer the same problem that bards do in that they're masters of none, except that a well-built bard /can/ be a master of various trades.  So far there doesn't really seem to be a lot of options for Inquisitors to focus themselves, but hopefully that will come in future books.  In an embarrassing gaffe, one of the Inquisitor's higher-level abilities is actually completely useless because it refers to a mechanic the pre-release version of the class had that was removed from the final version.<br /><br />The optional class features for the old base classes are generally pretty great.  Reminiscent of 2nd edition D&D's kits, you can swap various class abilities in order to change the focus of the class.  Every class gets a lot of fun options; for example, there's a Sniper variant for rogues where they become worse at trapfinding but better at ranged combat, and they can increase the range in which they can sneak attack.  Monks get the class Drunken Master option that makes them more powerful as they become inebriated.  Another option of note is anti-paladin, which is, to be blunt, disappointing.  It's basically a copy of the paladin class that replaces \\"good\\" with \\"evil\\" and \\"law\\" with \\"chaos.\\"  They're perfectly functional characters, mechanically, but I feel let down that nothing was done to make them feel unique rather than just an evil clone.<br /><br />The new feats, spells, and prestige classes are all pretty nice.  I just wish there were more prestige classes, really; there's eight of them, and they're all pretty interesting, although many of them have a very narrow focus that makes them only viable for specific character builds.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, it just leaves me wanting more.  As mentioned earlier, my only real complaint here is that some of them feel a little weak; they all have some kind of tradeoff, and it's hard to tell if it's worth it.  The Holy Vindicator, for example, is a really cool concept for melee-oriented clerics, but over 10 levels they only get 7 levels of improved spellcasting, and, of course, it doesn't advance cleric domains at all.  Their abilities are nice, but honestly I don't think they make up for losing 10 levels of domain progression and 3 levels of spellcasting.  Nonetheless, it's not /too/ bad a tradeoff, and I could definitely see myself doing it for flavor reasons.  Then there's the Stalwart Defender, which is mostly a clone of the 3.5 Dwarven Defender, down to the fact that they're weak against enemies who just ignore them and walk past them.  They get a lot of defensive abilities, but no offensive abilities, and unlike World of Warcraft, in Pathfinder monsters have no reason to concentrate on a player who isn't actually a threat.  I probably sound like I'm complaining a lot, but I really do like a lot of them, particularly the Master Chymist; they have sort of a Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde thing going on, where they actually develop a separate personality that can take over when they combat and force them to mutate.<br /><br />Anyway, overall this is a great book, and every Pathfinder group will want to have at least one to share amongst the players.  Sometimes it feels like Paizo was trying to play it a little /too/ safe and ended up making some options not as strong as the rest, but the concepts and flavor are great throughout the book., it doesn't advance cleric domains at all.

0307454541|5.0|Like so many books that garner a lot of hype, I had some initial reservations. And at first, I genuinely wondered what all the fuss was about - the opening unraveled slowly and the writing style (of either the author or the translator) seemed overly simplistic, with an overuse of passive verbs. Yet, the mystery and the characters' lives gradually gained momentum and I became completely hooked.<br />The title character bewitched me just as she dis so many of the main characters, making this a wonderful book all in all. While the outer-frame of the story, which involved the long introduction and conclusion could have been shortened, I am still excited to read the other two books. I am very curious about what will happen next for these characters, and there are many questions about them that I hope will be answered.<br />The author, unfortunately passed away shortly after selling these three manuscripts, and I am selfishly hoping that this was planned only as a trilogy and all of the loose ends are tied up by the third book's conclusion.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|I have owned 2 nostromos (n50 & n52) and this one has more bells and whistles.  1. very cool color back-lighting, well worth it for night time playing, even cooler is being able to make it any color of the rainbow.  2. awesome ability to program keys, works the same as the Nostromo   3. easy to use and program  4. love the LCD screen, it's a great addition to game keyboards    the only thing I do not like is some of the keys are tough to reach, I use it mainly for WOW (World of Warcraft)and It is a little tough to hit all the keys, I am sure it will just take more practice.    I would recommend this to anyone who plays WOW.
0307269981|5.0|Again, this was a bit slow to start, but once it got going, this sequel proved itself to be of the rare variety that is even better than the first! So exciting, and with a nail-gnawing ending... Very impressive and well worth all of the acclaim! I really loved this (and not just because so many significant chapters happened on my birthday, either!)! And an identical twin... I do hope that there is more about this mysterious sister in the last volume.<br />Truly, this has been one of the best mysteries that I have read in a while and I am sorely tempted to start reading the next book immediately, despite the rather late hour. What a wonderful book!
0307454541|3.0|Be forewarned, this book contains graphic rape scenes that aren't just graphic, they are also sadistic.  I thought these scenes were unfortunate, unnecessary and for me they damaged what would otherwise have been a good read.  The characters are well-developed and intriguing.  The plot is intricate and well-constructed.  The author is a good storyteller.  However, the story lost credibility toward the end when the author has some of his characters doing things that don't fit their personalities or the situation and has them doing things that are a bit over the top.
030726999X|5.0|Picking up right where the previous book ended, Larsson balanced his large cast of characters through till the very exciting conclusion of his trilogy. There were, naturally, some new developments and interesting side plots, but the majority of this book wrapped up plot elements started in the previous two books. I am going to miss these characters - even more so now that I know that the series was expected to continue on for at least another seven books (would this shadowy twin have played a larger role??... that remains one of my biggest un-addressed questions).<br />Lisbeth utterly charmed me, she is an impressive heroine, and all the more so since she was sketched into existence by a man. In fact, it is this underlying tone of Larsson's great respect for women (made even more crystal clear in this book in particular) that makes me even more depressed that these are his only finished novels before his untimely demise.<br />My only real complaint about the book - though I did enjoy every single page - was that many of the salient facts were frequently repeated. And considering the book's overall length, it seems that it was rather hesitantly edited (perhaps due to the posthumous publication and translation?) because it could have been made into a much tighter novel.<br />Still, this trilogy as a whole was thoroughly impressive and the Swedish setting only added to make things even more fascinating.
0439023513|4.0|Mockingjay is such a tragic story, and almost to the end of it I began to regret reading it. Thinking the endings I made up in my head were better than the ending of this story. Main characters die and leave you grieving for them. There is a lot of violence and massacre and I am not sure how young someone should be to read this book. Suzanne Collins does a great job describing events and bringing out emotions out of the reader whether it is anger, laughter, or grief.<br /><br />Mockingjay starts up where Catching Fire ended. Katniss is in the rubble of district 12, no longer what it use to be. Tripping over skulls, Katniss cannot really get a grip of what really happened. Only 800 or so survived. And this fuels Katniss revenge...to kill Snow. Then, Katniss is thrown into life in district 13 as a rebel, where schedules get printed on your arm and everything is straight and to the point. Katniss is still under the camera's scrutiny, but this time to defy the capitol and become the Mockingjay.<br /><br />Not only is this book about revenge for Katniss, but it digs deeper into some history of characters as well. Like, why President Snow smells like roses. Or Finnicks and Haymitch's history with the capitol and why they are how they are now. There is also a brief discussion about the meaning of the countries name \\"Panem\\".<br /><br />I think my favorite part of the book is the simple relationship between Katniss and Buttercup. At the beginning Katniss and Buttercup have a great interaction with each other giving some comic relief to the sorrow of the rest of the plot. But, at the end, the relationship between Katniss and Buttercup leaves me in tears. I really loved the addition of Buttercup in this book it really brought the book together for me. Even though it was a very small part of the book.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins has a great way of making the storyline become dull and a bit boring and then all at once hit you with a new situation that leave you at the edge of your seat, biting your fingernails as Katniss gets thrown into a tough spot.<br /><br />Some of the things that happened in the book, I really wished didn't happened. I don't want to say any of them to give it away. But to be vague, people dying. Or descriptions of people that were on the sidelines that died. It really bought emotion to the scene but at the same time was it necessary? You really get attached to a character and then all of sudden they are gone, dead. It was sad.<br /><br />In the end, everything comes together I suppose. Everything is wrapped up. And it was a great trilogy.ls as Katniss gets thrown into a tough spot.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The first two books hands down, brilliant. Couldn't put them down. I am grateful that I didnt have to wait like most of you, a year for this book to come out.But while this book does take a different direction, it does what it should. Takes us into the horrible world that Katniss and her friends live in. It leaves nothing out. You take the journey with Katniss and never stray for a moment. You feel all her pain and anguish at every turn. Well written and executed my only problem is the end. Without any spoilers all I have to say is. I loved the whole Hunger Games story. I just would have liked to see it end through Katniss eyes and not summarized for us by her. It was quickly written and summed up at the end. To take such a long journey through her eyes and see it end looking at her and not through her made me feel empty. If these books are made into movie, they will do very well.
B001F12J0C|5.0|I have watched these films a few times, and I think they are very well done. Action-packed and exciting, they keep you at the edge of your seat. Matt Damon does a superb job as Jason Bourne, and everyone else is extremely well cast too. These are the types of movies that you will come back to again and again.    This is definitely worth the $21 I spent on it, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys action, thrillers, or secret-agent type films.    For those who are so concerned, there is some vulgarity in all three films, but no pornography nor inappropriate content.
0439023513|3.0|This is a well written, well constructed conclusion to the Hunger Games Trilogy.  \\"Mockingjay\\" ultimately takes us where we thought we would go, with the good guys winning and the bad guys losing.  I don't think this is a surprise or a spoiler to anyone.  It's a matter of how they get there that is a problem.<br /><br />SOME SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!<br /><br />One of the major plot themes of the first two books is katniss' path to maturity, self awareness, etc.  That is a huge part of great science fiction.  \\"Ender's Game\\" has been referenced in at least one review, but in fact in that book Ender ultimately goes off as an ambassador using the recollections of a defeated society to create a new method of coming toterms to with a life lived for his society.  There is proof of individual growth, and with a societal benefit.<br /><br />That demonstrated growh is why \\"Ender's Game\\" is considered great science fiction and an interesting discussion about the education and growth of gifted children, and why \\"Mockingjay\\" is ultimately not all it could be.<br /><br />Katniss does not such thing, and I think that was critical for this book to continue what was done in the first two books.  You know the Capitol will fall, so it needs something else to make the book breathe.  Instead of growth, of taking control of herself, Katniss is buffeted about by the decisions of others.  Some are logically encountered, others not so much.  Nowhere does the author really create the truly shocking moments that pepper the first two books.  When Katniss makes decisions, or comes to major changes in thinking-like who she really wants to kill-there is nothing to substantiate it.  We never see her at her trial, we never hear her justify her decisions to the populace that adores her.  A character offers a condition of how she will ultimately choose between Gale and Peeta-but instead the decision is made for her by others.<br /><br />For this to be truly huge finale we needed-and frankly, deserved-a conclusion with a more fully formed Katniss, and to hear her explain and/or defend her decisions-be it in court, conversation, or in a letter.<br /><br />With that, the book would have been a big time 5+ star book.  Instead, it is a three start beach book that could have been so much more., and to hear her explain and/or defend her decisions-be it in court, conversation, or in a letter.

B003OF3R0S|5.0|Whether or not you're a fan of Avenged Sevenfold, it should be undeniable that \\"Nightmare\\" is an album that represents a maturity of songwriting, a complexity of vision, and virtuosic musical talent that I had not expected from this band. As far as I'm concerned, this album can easily stand alongside the best in the metal world such as Dream Theater and Opeth; such is the growth that Avenged Sevenfold exhibit with this album. The music is thematically, conceptually, and melodically diverse, spanning several genres and a host of musical instruments and influences. This is a collection of amazingly well-written songs which traverse vast musical ground, and while each song maintains its own identity, the collection manages to cohere amazingly well as an album; from start to finish, the songs flow beautifully together. And just when you think the album has thrown its last curveball, you'll come to the next song or passage that completely takes you off-guard.     I can't say enough good things about this album, but I don't want to bore you. Take note: I'm not particularly fond of earlier Avenged Sevenfold music, but as a fan of bands like Dream Theater, Tool, and Opeth, I've got high standards when it comes to metal. What more can I say about this album, other than the fact that it stands alongside my favorite albums of all time, such as Tool's \\"Lateralus,\\" Dream Theater's \\"Train of Thought,\\" or Opeth's \\"Ghost Reveries?\\" This album is truly something special.

1401300529|4.0|When I first started reading The Coldest Winter, I was anticipating a military history of the war with an emphasis on the units and the battles of the war.  While there was fair a amount of this type of detail, the book had a much broader purpose.  In particular, there was much attention paid to the personalities of the war (Truman, Rhee, Mao, MacArthur, Acheson, etc.)    While I was hoping for a greater focus on the combat, I finished the book feeling that I had learned a good deal about the time period and the people and personalities involved.      Mr. Halberstam is an excellent writer.  His text is easy and interesting to read.    I would highly recommend this book to anyone that is interested in gaining a greater understanding of the military and political influences that triggered the war and the factors that impacted the course and the outcome.

Then, it starts from the simple elements that now have a shorter syntax and new semantic elements that are intended to specify that a web page has articles, sections, header and footer. It always tell you why something exists, which is very helpful as compared to just providing examples with their respective screen shots as other books do or as you would get from finding the examples yourself searching online.<br /><br />The book will not disappoint you but the support of HTML5 may do so, depending on what you want to really do. For example, it seems too much work to get different versions of a video in order to make it work in most web browsers. It is not a problem of HTML5, it is a problem of lack of agreement among Web browsers and of patents behind (most of) video codecs. The new elements for forms are the best example of lack of browser support on elements that, after a decade, you would imagine would be standard components by now. The microdata elements, actually, attributes instead of elements, show that also after a decade of \\"Semantic Web\\", the semantic markup of content of web pages will likely be based on a practical solution that is easy to implement for the html/web developer, as opposed to other methods that never really took off (such as microformats and RDFa).<br /><br />The things that seem promising in HTML5 are the canvas, storage for web applications, and geolocation but it will depend on whether you will really need to use it or not. If any of canvas, storage, geolocation or video interests you, and you are new to using them in HTML, then this book is way better way to get it right as opposed to finding examples online.
B002ZG977Y|1.0|Here we have yet another Greek myth butchered. Hollywood seems incapable of realizing that special effects cannot override awful screen plays, and it is religiously devoted to ruining ancient tales that probe eternal verities with Modern and Postmodern nonsense. This myth is ruined in this film with so many irreconcilable intrusions that it becomes a boring joke.
B002AOWXQ8|5.0|I heard Home one day and instantly fell in love with this band. Their style of music and unique sound is amazing. I listened to a few of their other songs and thought they sounded pretty good as well. Its very rare that I'll buy a cd and like all the songs. Maybe one or two, but never all. This cd has an amazing track after track.
0439023513|2.0|When I read Hunger Games and Catching Fire, I was blown away. I loved both these books and had such respect for Collins creativity, for the world she built, the characters, the pacing of the book, and the non-stop action. Knowing Collins' talent, I had high expectations for the third book. After finishing Mockingjay, I grieved the end of the series, not because of the story between the pages, but for what the finale could have been. The reviewers who said that the reader is detached from the action and emotion are spot on. Reading this book was like watching events unfold through a tiny keyhole--it was impossible to connect with the characters, which I was able to do so effortlessly in the previous installments. The set up of the climax of this series required two books, I feel there should have been two books to wrap everything up. The external conflicts, primarily the rebellion against the Capitol were resolved, but Katniss and the other characters are left in emotional stasis at the end of the book. Key emotional scenes are missing or glossed over, and has been pointed out by other reviewers Katniss is stripped of her fire and reduced to a passive pawn.<br /><br />I get that war and tragedy can empty a person's soul. Just because that's reality doesn't make it good fiction or a satisfying read. While Collins drives the point home that war is hell (over and over and over, I felt bludgeoned by it), she ignores the resiliency of the human race that's been displayed throughout the centuries. In the first two books Katniss displayed that resiliency--its a deeply ingrained in her, a part of her being. What a waste that Collins chose not to show Katniss triumph over her fears, over her circumstance, over seemingly unbeatable odds. She did this in Hunger Games and in Catching Fire. But when it really counted, she disappeared from the page, stuck in a haze of moping and self-pity. A fourth book could have explored these issues, and could have given readers an ending worthy of the first two books.e first two books.

B001PJRAUS|4.0|This has become one of my favorite movies!  It's a Jane Austen mash up.  Great cast, well written plot makes this a must see movie.  It does help to know the plot line of  Pride and Prejudice.  So, maybe, see the Collin Firth movie version of P&P first.
3822835412|5.0|Superb text and iconic pictures of a magnificent city.<br /><br />A great book to own !
0393068382|5.0|This is an excellent book. It is witty and absorbing and just about impossible to put down. It is packed with the results of a multitude of studies. It is a myth-busting, incisive, mind-changing delight. It deals with the \\"delusions\\" that many people have concerning gender differences, and how these delusions have a powerful (though often unconscious) effect on people's lives.    The central myth that the author confronts is that men and women have widely different sets of ability that are mostly innate, hard-wired, and unchangeable. The author argues that this has not been demonstrated. In fact, it is not even clear that these differences in ability exist.    Take empathy. If you test people's empathy by asking them how empathetic they think they are (and yes, some scientists actually do this), then women test much higher than men. But if you actually test their abilities (by, for instance, asking what emotions are being expressed in a particular face), women do only a tiny bit better than men. And if you design the study to get rid of gender biases (the author shows how researchers do this), then women do no better than men.    Or take the ability to mentally rotate objects in space which, for a long time, has been considered to be necessary for success in math and engineering. Usually men do better than women. But if you fib and tell a group of test-takers that \\"women perform better than men in this test, usually for genetic reasons,\\" then women perform as well as the men.    And on it goes. The author shows how subtle cues in our environment affect our identities and thus our behaviors and thus our life course. And how our implicit beliefs are often diametrically opposed to our explicit beliefs and how this can wreak havoc in our societies.     There are also sections on more obvious instances of gender bias in the workplace and at home, the difficulties interpreting MRI studies, the subtle ways that parents \\"teach\\" gender to their children even while claiming (and believing) that they are being gender-neutral, the effects (or not) of pre-natal testosterone, sex differences in animal behavior (did you know that a male rat will take care of an infant rat if it's placed in it's cage?), the \\"seductive allure\\" of neuroscience, and more.    A wonderful book. I think I'm going to go and read it again. . . .
0439023483|5.0|In listening to a friend describe this book, I was taken aback by the intensity and impied violence of the theme and considered the book inappropriate for my 12 year old daughter.  After reading it - boy was I wrong!  What a wonderfully written book!  How did Suzanne Collins tackle the absurdities of our world and disguise them in the fictitious futuristic (or is it) world of Panem?  An unbelievable book in the questions that it raises and the discussions to follow for young and old minds alike to consider.  A must read and a must discussion for all to have!  Wow!
B0037RDPEG|3.0|My first language is not Eng...it's hard to me for reading an English book without a dictionary....anyway, it's my problem.  I have bought the paper version 2 years ago, and I can't finished it, even though I was really enjoy the Italian part, but with a 2 kg Oxford dictionary on the right hand which just made me exhausted    Now, I have bought a iphone kindle version---I paid total 25 dollar for 1 book!!!---it's worth!! That's a amazing, LOVE it. I have just finished the India part, I like the installed dictionary function which can \\"turbo\\" my reading speed.    But it come up with another question---I am going to buy an android phone---personally, I think Android phone is more humane and \\"not selfish\\" as iphone base on a bad experience happened few weeks before....    Can anyone tell me, is it possible to transfer my iphone edition book to Android phone...is it possible??? I definitely don't want to pay extra $11 for the same book---not because of the money, it just super stupid if I do it.    I respect Iphone, that's why I didn't jail break it (Actually, I don't know how to do it, my friends told me it could be very dangerous cause all data might be disappear as a punishment), but I believe I also have the right to \\"enjoy\\" all my purchase in different channels---Am I right?

B003A4IFDW|1.0|Truly an awful, awful CD. The classic songs are mangled & hacked beyond recognition, played at a deaths crawl. Even a song like Zep's All Of My Love, which wasn't any good in its original version, is made far worse. I'd rather go deaf than have to listen to this horrid CD again.
0439023513|2.0|I loved the first two books of the Hunger Games trilogy and was quite excited to read the final book.  The beginning of the book was terribly slow, the entire storyline was monotonous and extremely depressing, and the it seems that Suzanne just ran out of steam when it came to the ending of the book (and trilogy).  It ended so suddenly and just left me depressed.  If an author is going to write a trilogy, may I suggest saving the best for last instead of bombing at the end?  It was all going so well with the first two books (especially the first), but the third was sorely lacking in so many respects.  Just read the first two and then imagine your own ending--it would be much more satisfactory than what the author has written.
B003QCCS36|5.0|This is my first taste of Ray LaMontagne - I'd been ignoring the persistent amazon.com \\"recommendation\\" for Gossip in the Rain, until I heard his latest in a music store and got it immediately, and I'm pleasantly surprised how much I like it. My first impression was of Joni Mitchell (vocal and musical styling), but it has a wider early 70 soft rock/americana sound - like Dan Fogelberg, or Jonathan Edwards. Yet the production/recording is better - crisp, full and clean - 2010 quality. And then there's the opening song (Repo Man), which musically reminds me of a cross between Rory Gallagher's  \\"Walk on Hot Coals\\" and Seatrain's \\"13 Questions\\" - maybe it's not world class song-writing but it reflects a fine reto heritage indeed!
0198610572|3.0|This is a dictionary which would be useful for those learning English. It is not so good for those reading 19th Century literature. It is beautifully presented and easy to read but does not have sufficient detail on some more obscure words.
0553805371|4.0|I came to The Grand Design having never taken a physics class and I had never opened a book by either of the authors and I left amazed by the profound philosophical implications of ... physics.  This surprisingly short book has chapters covering ancient philosophies of the universe (with many snippets from non-western thought throughout), the modern philosophy of science, the parts making up the universe, quantum physics, the concept that there are many true histories leading up to any moment, attempts to come up with a single physics to explain everything, the physical structure of the universe, the seemingly impossible set of coincidences needed to create a universe where humans can live, and the role of God in creation.  Somehow, the authors cram that into less than 200 pages and the book is readable.<br /><br />The art and diagrams are great and make it possible for a complete novice, like me, to follow along with really abstract complicated theories.  There are a few spots where the material is not adequately explained but overall the concepts are brilliantly laid out.  I am giving the book only 4 starts because of a couple spots where it was too difficult to follow the logic or inadequate explanations were given in a couple places (like the Feynman diagrams).<br /><br />Overall this book is easy to read and it is going to be the fodder for endless religious and philosophical debates.  Get it early so you can weigh in.
B000YAA68C|1.0|Pass on Swank, although I realize the Director, and others, rule.  But horribly miscast. Pass on the script.  Pass on the direction.  The supporting cast was there, talented, and ready to work and they got the shaft.<br /><br />I can hear the Director:  \\"Kathy, Lisa please be your sterotypes.\\"<br />Please, actors:  save your money so that you can turn down wretched roles.<br /><br />Apart from that, I am appalled that women reviewers like this film.  If you are really like this Holly character, then we're all doomed.<br /><br />If you watch more than 3 minutes of this movie, you will feel you should do penance for enabling it.

0307473708|5.0|If you tend to fall for the \\"bad guy,\\" then your are going to absolutely love this bad guy.  Darkly Dreaming Dexter is the first is a series of books that feature Dexter Morgan as the main Character.  This book is dark, dramatic, thrilling, hilarious, and romantic.<br /><br />What makes this book so truly enjoyable is the amazing character development of the main character, Dexter.  Once you know Dexter, it is impossible not to like him.  Dexter is a serial killer who only kills the bad guys.  He is driven by a force he calls the \\"dark passenger.\\"  This book keeps you wondering what is going to happen next.  It is an easy, interesting, fun read.
0439023513|5.0|This is the resolution to a fight against evil, where finally the heroine of the book, well lets say there is a lot of people in this book who are heroes, and who are not. Where the heroes shine with their own light, which each action has a reaction sometimes good sometimes really bad. Where what happened on the previous book just pales in comparison, where there is so much resolution and realization. Where there are tears of joy and tears of happiness all mixed in. Where there is sorrow and there is love. But over all there is hope, where you read the book and you just want for the next battle to have a good outcome, where each challenge you are rooting for the good guys (even if some times you are not really sure who they are).<br />Where when you reach the end, there is no other thing to do but to read it again and again. Because you are there with her, you were there with Katniss through everything she went through and you understand where she is at.
B002C6A6N6|4.0|I was very excited to be able to order the complete series since I loved watching the show when I was younger. This series made history come alive for me. Each episode is exceptionally well-written. If more television shows had creators like Beth Sullivan, there would be much better programs to watch! I've always loved the wonderful characters and cast and enjoy how the major storyline is interwoven in the minor storylines of each episode. I was, however, disappointed to find out that the DVDs freeze at times during episodes. Amazon was great about returning the first set and sent a replacement right away. I am hoping that I will not experience similar problems with the replacement.

B0034G4OU4|1.0|Eat, Pray, Love was, first and foremost, boring.  Nothing happened--no adventure, no enlightenment, no interesting conversations, no revelations, no self-discovery (or discovery of anything else, for that matter).      Second, this movie was trite.  Reminiscent of the ego tripping of the 1960's, it added nothing new to any debate about anything--humanity, nature, individualism, all of these were possible topics.  The movie touched on none of them.    Third, this movie was improbable.  Liz wakes up one morning, deciding (for no ascertainable reason) to dump her husband and go on a year-long odyssey to discover something, or recover something, or whatever.  She apparently has the funds to do this, which should come as a surprise to everyone (including herself) after her divorce.  We certainly never see her worried about money or whether her mail will catch up with her, or how to pay her income taxes or credit card bills.  In Italy, she eats pasta and moans about an increasing weight we certainly never see.  In India, she stays on an ashram that seems to cater to spiritual tourists, but we never see her eating or sick.  She never even gets dirty.  In Bali, she takes on a huge commitment to transcribe ancient Balinese wisdom for a wise man, but abandons this endeavor without warning or excuse to spend three weeks (!) in bed with a handsome and very unusual Brazilian man.  (When did any of you ever meet a gorgeous Brazilian man who was willing to be a househusband?)    Fourth, this movie represented selfishness and hypocrisy at extraordinary levels.  She dumps her husband with no warning, no counseling, nothing.  She goes where she wants and tramples upon whomever she wishes to crush.  Given that she is on a mission of self-indulgence, it is shocking that she works to persuade a 17 year old Indian woman to marry the man her family has chosen for her.  Why isn't this girl entitled to the same freedom that Liz feels is her own right?  She does one thing that might be considered to be outside the solipsistic world she has created:  she writes to her friends to ask them to donate money to a Balinese healer who desperately needs a house.  But even that is staggeringly self-centered:  she bases her request to them on the premise that, if she were in New York, her friends would be throwing a very expensive birthday party for her, to which they would bring expensive bottles of wine as gifts.  What presumption!    In case you have read this far in this review, and in case, having read this far, you don't get the picture, this is a terrible movie.

B001PJRAUS|5.0|What girl has read or seen Pride and Prejudice and not fantasized being Elizabeth Bennett?       A brief synopsis:  The current heroine, 21st century Amanda, is enthralled with Pride and Prejudice; through a time portal in her bathroom, she gets to change places with the novel's heroine Elizabeth Bennett. The filmmakers take this in two directions simultaneously....      * First,  Amanda creates a butterfly effect in that all the novel characters behave as one might expect but the outcome is quite different than what Jane Austen wrote for her characters.     * Second, Amanda is a fish out of water as she navigates a 200 year old society, while Elizabeth is coming to terms with the 21st century.    There are lots of little fun takeoffs and surprises.... For instance,   * The pond scene from the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice (Colin Firth version)is mimicked.  * The Charlotte Lucus character goes off in an entirely different direction.... literally  *  Jane's marriage is not what one would expect  * Amanda's virginity becomes an issue  * Mr. Darcy pays a visit to 21st century London (another fish out of water)  * The 18th century characters are properly impressed with Amanda's income of £25,000/year.  * Elizabeth is asked to play at the piano, she apparently played Petula Clark's Downtown    You have to know a bit about Pride and Prejudice to understand all that is going.  But if you do,  $7.99 spent on this dvd will give you more enjoyment that you can imagine.  I highly recommend this.

B002ZG97RE|2.0|First of all, I agree with this movie on one point. That is NO weapon of mass destruction found in Iraq. History has proved that's an un-deniable fact.<br /><br />Secondly, Matt Damon's acting is truly riveting. It's the only reason that kept me watching this film till the end.<br /><br />Thirdly, all other aspects of this picture are disappointing. For example, the hand-held camera style of filming made it very hard to see what's happening.<br /><br />Because of all the reasons above, I gave it 2 stars.<br /><br />Rottentomatoes website shows it made 33.1 millions at the US box office.
B0007TKNIS|3.0|This is the type of musical I'd normally never buy but I made the exception because I think Gerard Butler is worth it.  Even without the mask, with the so-called deformity of one side of his face, he's sexier and better-looking than the Count.  It's hard to believe that Christine didn't choose him.  The rest of the story I found typically overwrought and full of screeching songs and to be honest, I never got why both men were interested in such an insipid heroine.  But let me give Minnie Driver her props: she was pretty good in her role.  I wonder why she isn't a bigger star.
B003UYUQZW|3.0|This movie clearly aims at kids, and teens. It also caters to hard-core video gamers who love Prince of Persia game franchise. There are a lot of jumping just like in the games.    There are many fighting scenes. They look okay. The scenes are colorful and beautiful. The special effects look riveting. For example, the snake scene looks very real.   Jake Gyllenhaal's acting is fun and engaging.  Gemma Arterton's acting is stiff. The time-shifting twist keeps the movie interesting till the end. If you're looking for characters' depth here, you'll be disappointed.     The ostrich racing scene looks original to me. I've never seen something like that before.     This movie reminds me of  Scorpion King. As a family movie, it's absolutely worth watching once.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|The one problem with netbook size computers, is often the speakers and sound output is beyond terrible. When your hooked up to your home video system, its not a problem, but when you are on the road, sitting in MacDonalds, its impossible to hear. Such was the case with my new Acer 1830T i5 Netbook computer trying to watch a movie while eating a Big Mac. I couldn't hear a darn thing. Then someone put me on to this little gizmo and now my problem is solved. The sound output from the little amp is more than loud enough to drive two sets of headphones, even in MacDonalds. In fact, I have to lower the computer volume to make it comfortable. This is a low cost, easy to use, great little portable amp for solving the sound problems of these little Netbook computers while on the go.
0316069884|2.0|Although the facts concerning the cruelty to animals on factory farming operations and in slaughtering houses made this a two star instead of a one star review, I am still undoing the damage of nine years on a vegan diet. The only ways to obtain B12 is either supplementation or through eating animal products. Vitamin D is either gotten through sunlight, supplementation or animal products. Animal products are the only way to obtain EPA and DHA, the breakdown products of Omega three linoleic acid. EPA and DHA are brain food and also work inside the bodies cell to enable them to function. Flax is high in linoleic acid, which is parent product that breaks down in EPA and DHA, but from all I have read many people do not make this conversion well.     The best book I've read on nutrition is \\"The Metabolic Type Diet,\\" by William Wolcott. According to Wolcott some people need higher fat, protein diets than other people. I'm one of those, so my years of vegan eating with little fat or protein were a disaster for me. According to Wolcott, a second group need a mix of high fat, protein foods, low fat, protein foods and more carbohydrates. A third group need more carbohydrates, and less fat and protein. We all need some of each group, fats carbohydrates and proteins, some people just need more of certain nutrients and less of other nutrients.    My love for animals aside, I can not be healthy on either a vegan or vegetarian diet. Having been a Seventh Day Adventist for a number of years, I've seen way to many pasty colored, skinny, ridden with allergies, just pain unhealthy vegans. Even a vegetarian diet needs adequate fat and protein to be workable.The author doesn't mention these vital concepts even once in the book. The book of Proverbs tells us that how we treat our animals will affect us personally. My solution to the \\"horrors\\" of the way most animals are raised and butchered is to eat the healthiest animal products I can obtain. If at all possible locally grown and alwaysorganic. I know the farmer who raises my beef, as well as my chicken. I know this is more expensive and some can't afford it. But just look at what we spend our money on that we could do without. The quality of our food is extremely important.  I'm typing this review on a ten year old computer, which obviously works just fine and live in a small condo, but eat the highest quality food I can afford.    I agree with the reviewers who contend the author is often silly, overly emotional in his arguments for a vegetarian diet, and overly pushy concerning his vegetarian beliefs. While animals have very real feelings, they are not human. Also, even though the author claims to be a vegetarian, he is a vegan. His thanksgiving dinner is all carbohydrates, which is unhealthy. He has nothing good say about even pastured, organic eggs and dairy, which are eaten by vegetarians. Also, what does his wife think of all of this? After a few words about her in discussing the birth of their not his baby, the book is all about author and his odd parents and grandparents. He goes to lengths to let you know how different these people are. I only hope the author comes to his senses before he does his son any real harm. I know some very sickly vegans. A really interesting book on the subject of factory farming is,\\"Righteous Porkchop.\\"
0470424656|5.0|I have the 4th edition and it is a fantastic book especially when you are trying to get the grips on valuation, more so when you are not coming from a \\"pure\\" accounting background. Chapters 5 (6 in the new edition) onwards till 12 really take you step by step through the intricacies - a top-down approach. However, I will suggest Penman's Financial Statement Analysis & Security Valuation - Part 2 where the FSA detailed is really great - getting the FCF in 2 steps instead of the traditional 7+ steps, to be read in conjunction with this book. Rosenbaum's Investment Banking is good for developing the eye-catching spreadsheet models.
0439023513|5.0|Here's the thing--reading Mockingjay was like setting down to dinner with a friend you haven't seen in a long time, and really really looking forward to it, and then having that friend open the dinner conversation with: I've got cancer. So then you're left in this no-man's land of: well, this sucks. I really wanted \\"friend time,\\" but now we're gonna have to do \\"crying, sobbing, life sucks\\" time. But how horrible and shallow am I if I complain?    Thus it is with Mockingjay.     I wanted Hunger Games/Catching Fire 3.0 and I got 1984/Native Son/Beloved/Kick You in The Teeth book. I respect Suzanne Collins in a way that, I just didn't think I would of a YA author. But I also want to strap myself into a blankie and die.    Win some lose some, I suppose.    And--to be fair--there was that one happy moment when (SPOILER) Peeta offers her the can of lamb stew (her favorite!). Yep. Soup: happiest point of the novel, people.

0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay is not an easy book to read, but it is beautifully executed and brilliantly conceived.  In my opinion, Suzanne Collins takes the story she started in the Hunger Games to its only logical conclusion.  Is it pretty and tied up in a nice neat bow?  No.  Nor should it be.  Never once did I feel that any of the characters were untrue to themselves.  I cared about each of them.  I understood that the circumstances they were thrown in were beyond what most of us could deal with.  Katniss is a hero. Maybe not the kind that most expected, but a hero nonetheless.
0446563048|3.0|When I started reading this book I though it was simply a monologue about the author and his successes and near failures. I always enjoy these types of stories but this book really didn't strike me a as being anything special. That was until I started to dig a little deeper into Zappos.<br /><br />I think that if you simply read this book and leave it at that then you are missing out on something. It is only after doing some additional research on Zappos have I come to understand what a unique business Zappos is.<br /><br />You really need to step back and look at this book in a different light because at first glance it may not appear as much. However, upon closer inspection it demonstrates the power of focus and commitment to principles. It should also make you think differently about business once you understand how differently Zappos goes about things.<br /><br />To get the most from this book you'll have to seek extra information about Zappos beyond this book. Judged on its own it is hard to recommend this book, however when used to under the uniqueness that is Zappos, then it is certainly worthwhile.
0312427646|4.0|From the back cover:<br />When her corgis stray into a mobile library parked near Buckingham Palace, the Queen feels duty-bound to borrow a book. Discovering the joy of reading widely and intelligently, she finds that her view of the world changes dramatically. Abetted in her new found obsession by Norman, a young man from the royal kitchens, the Queen comes to question the prescribed order of the world and loses patience with the routines of her role as monarch. Her new passion for reading initially alarms the palace staff and soon leads to surprising and very funny consequences for the country at large.<br /><br />Review:<br />Not since Roald Dahl's The BFG have I so loved a depiction of the Queen of England. This book is so funny and packed full of literary jokes. I am nowhere near as well read as I would like to be, so I could tell that I missed quite a few of the references, but the one's I did get were very clever. There are some parts of the story that are written so well and are utterly hilarious - I couldn't help it and laughed aloud, thank goodness I was reading on the couch and not on the bus or train!<br /><br />Hilarious though it is, there is a delicious, subversive undercurrent that is scandalous to the conservative sensibilities of monarchists. I thoroughly enjoyed this novella and think book lovers will relate to the Queen's journey through reading and love the literary references.

I highly recommend its reading.

0439023513|4.0|i love this series and its' characters.  but w/ mockingjay, i wanted more.  More romance, more details, closure, just more out of the characters, more of the story.   sure, i was happy about who she ended up with, but it was just one paragraph and that was it.  and what about her friendship with gale?  he got a fancy job in 2 and end of story.  come on!  i don't mind reading another hundred pages.  it doesn't even have to have a \\"and they lived happily ever after\\" sort of end, but like what happened to all these characters we grew to know?  who came back to 12?  who went where and what happened to their lives?  kat and gale were such good friends and then he falls off the face of the earth.  give me more about peeta and kat, not just that they grew back together.  i understand it's a war story, but underneath it, there were other stories about friendship and love.  where did all that go?   if i wanted to read just a war story, i would have read a history textbook instead.

0545265355|5.0|The Hunger Games (Trilogy) is one of the most \\"unputdownable\\" books to enter the teen market in a long time. The cliffhangers at the end of each volume are so intense, you can't help but continue on. Knowing this in advance, I decided against reading the series last summer despite the fact that everyone was talking about it. I waited the extra year, and I'm glad I did--even a week was torture when it came to getting my grubby mitts on a copy of Mockingjay.<br /><br />For the record, this isn't a series for everyone. You will be drained emotionally by its end. The Hunger Games is one of the grimmest dystopian worlds I've encountered in literature. A lot of characters die, and their deaths aren't pleasant. This series may not be for you. Then again, those who know me well would say it's not for me, either. I'm one of the most squeamish people you'll meet, and The Hunger Games more closesly resembles the movie Battle Royale than I thought it would when I started reading. I really enjoyed the series, though. There are scenes so poignant, they'll stick with me. Between this and Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy, I've found that even squeamish ole me can still enjoy a disturbing book if it's thought-provoking and well-written.<br /><br />Now that I've warned you about the contents, let's move on to the meat of this review. It's hard to go in-depth without giving a lot away, so I decided to focus on the trilogy as a whole instead of singling out Mockingjay and reviewing it on its own (though I do have a paragraph dedicated to it further down). A brief synopsis for the uninitiated:<br />The trilogy takes place in the future. The USA has been destroyed; in its place is Panem, which consists of thirteen districts and a Capitol city. Before the series begins, the districts revolt against the Capitol and are defeated; the thirteenth is completely obliterated. As retribution for their crimes, each district is now required to send a boy and girl, called tributes, to participate in the annual Hunger Games. The games are centered around survival; there can only be one winner (Luckily, most of the deaths occur off-page, so it makes it easier for the squeamish to read). The characters are very rich and detailed; some of their deaths hit incredibly hard and are forever memorable. In the second book, Catching Fire, there is a lot of unease in the districts, and a lot of anger when the year's Hunger Games take a twisted turn and past winners are forced to battle it out for survival. The final book, Mockingjay, consists of a full out rebellion; the districts are at war with the Capitol and it's do or die in a showdown so explosive, readers never see it coming.<br /><br />Mockingjay has already received flack for not going in the direction fans anticipated. Most were caught up in a romantic triangle and hoped the final book would have a heavy emphasis on this theme with war as a backdrop and a happily-ever-after on the horizon. At the same time, Suzanne Collins has been setting up the revolution since Day One; the grim nature of the first two books should lead readers to believe that the finale will continue in a similar vein. Yes, people will die and it won't always be fair. That's life. I think the direction of Mockingjay was natural, especially in war-like situations. Characters will not be the same as they were earlier in life; war changes you. I would have been disappointed if Collins sidestepped harsh realities in order to soften the story. The tale she weaves is extreme, but it's also genuine. To me, by sticking to her guns and not copping out for something friendlier, she has created a memorable, haunting series that will stick with you long after you've finished reading it.<br /><br />I'd also like to bring attention to the amazing book jacket art put together by designer Elizabeth B. Parisi and artist Tim O'Brien. At first glance, they don't mean much, but once you've read the serious, you notice just how ingenious they truly are. BeforeI read the series, I looked at the preview of the Mockingjay jacket and thought, \\"Wow, that's bright compared to the first two.\\" Now I know better. Each book features a mockingjay, which is a hybrid mix of mockingbird and jabberjay (a Capitol creation used for spying on enemies during the first rebellion). The first book features the bird as the pin the main character, Katsa's, friend gives to her. The book is black and grim, giving it a desolate air. Every character in the Games feels hopeless, as though he/she won't survive. The second book's mockingbird is trapped inside a clock-like environment, which is the setting of the Hunger Games in this volume. The book is red for fire (both for its title, Catching Fire, and the literal associations with the element in the book), for anger (the fact that previous survivors of the Hunger Games must participate once more), and for bloodshed. Both books feature these circular objects that link to one another representing the way the districts and Capitol are linked. The final book features a mockingjay with its wings spread out. The linked circles are in broken pieces around it. The book is a vivid sky blue, the color of peace and hope. These covers have become favorites of mine; I adore the symbolism.<br /><br />All in all, I'm personally glad I've read this series and wouldn't change a thing. I'm glad I didn't sidestep it due to its violent nature and extreme situations. This trilogy is one I'll read again to delve into the intricate layers I know Collins has laid out for us. Collins is a master at capturing a society at war and showing the horrors that come when a corrupt government is in control.preview of the Mockingjay jacket and thought, \\"Wow, that's bright compared to the first two.\\" Now I know better.

B002ZG9968|2.0|This movie had a lot of unfulfilled potential. I guess it would be the not-so-funny sister-movie to \\"Knocked Up.\\" It is difficult  to feel attached to the characters. I think the movie introduced too many characters so by the end of the movie you're wondering what happened to x,y, and z. I was so unattached to the Jennifer Lopez character that I had to ask my husband what her name was again at the end of the movie.<br /><br />Be prepared to be traumatized- especially if you're a man, or a child, or perhaps even the family dog. The scene where her (Zoe- Jennifer Lopez) single mother's group meets for a friend's at-home birth is quite disturbing. It had potential to be a memorable hilarious scene in cinema, but went entirely overboard into the twilight zone. My husband couldn't watch the scene at all. By the time it was over, my mouth hung open, and I wanted to take a shower to wash the disgust off. The dear friend who recommended this movie will be harshly rewarded.<br /><br />At the end of the day- what makes a good movie might be that you would purchase it or at least watch it again. I would let this movie rot on its lonely warehouse shelf.
0545140315|5.0|The Lonely Hearts Club was a really sweet, lighthearted book. Reading it was a fun, engrossing way to pass the time. As a reader, I found myself sucked into Penny Lane's life, unwilling to stop reading and deny myself the pleasure of seeing what happened next. TLHC wasn't at all what I had been expecting, and I truly found myself caring about the characters who were sharing their lives with me.<br /><br />In short, the novel is about a couple of teenage girls who decide to swear off dating because they're tired of the way guys treat them. They form The Lonely Hearts Club and their idea begins spreading through the school. Throughout it all, the girls explore the depths of friendship and learn to become strong individuals who can ultimately allow guys into their lives while still respecting themselves and not changing who they are for \\"some boy.\\" The novel was like a nice, refreshing glass of lemonade on a clear, sunny day (certainly lighter than a lot of what I've been reading lately!).<br /><br />But be warned! By the time I hit the last page, I had The Beatles stuck in my head due to the integral part their music played in the book. Even the name of TLHC stems from a Beatles song/album (\\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\"). On top of that, the book jacket is designed to look like a feminine version of the cover image of the album Abbey Road, which is kind of awesome.<br /><br />While we're talking about the design side of things, the book was really nice to hold in my hands. It's definitely worth reading a physical copy for this one. The final page of some of the chapters consisted of a lovely gray page rarely seen in books, then was followed by a Beatles quote. The quotes reminded me of Penny Lane's journal and the importance of Beatle quotes in her life. Plus, as I said earlier, I loved the cover. Cover art always interests me. I'd love to design a book cover someday myself. ^_^<br /><br />All in all, reading this book was time well spent. I recommend giving this book a go. :)

0439023513|3.0|Mockingjay, the final volume in Suzanne Collins's Hunger Games trilogy, is a dark and depressing tale of war and its aftermath.  Seventeen-year-old Katniss Everdeen has been enlisted by the so-called rebel government in District 13 to play the role of symbolic hero (the \\"Mockingjay\\") in their war against the corrupt government in the Capitol. Reluctantly, Katniss agrees.  But it becomes clear very quickly that District 13 isn't very different from the Capitol government it's trying to overthrow.  Everything seems to be corrupt in this very bleak future world.<br /><br />This isn't an easy novel to read.  Katniss is depressed most of the time - she's moody and frustrated, and her actions seem motivated more by resignation than by belief in anything.  She has lost one of her boyfriends from the first two volumes (Peeta has been brainwashed against her and is held hostage in the Capitol for the first half of the book), and childhood friend Gale spends more time making snarky jealous comments than he does acting like a potential lover.  So readers looking for a resolution to the romantic triangle that played center stage in both of the first two novels will likely be disappointed.<br /><br />What works in this book is its realistic tone - Collins does a commendable job getting her readers to see what it might be like to live in a world where the government forces children to kill each other for the entertainment of a TV audience.  I can't blame Katniss for her depressive state, and I think it's more than believable that her focus on which boyfriend to pick gets pushed to the back burner while she plots to assassinate President Snow.  This is war, after all, and war is horrible and depressing and dehumanizing.  To make matters even worse, even after the war is over life isn't so great.  A lot of people die in this book; some of them are characters we've grown to love.  But that's what war is, and it would have been disingenuous of Collins not to be honest about that.<br /><br />At the same time, what doesn't work is the novel's ending.  [SPOILERS AHEAD - please don't continue reading if you haven't read the book]  Collins attempts to wrap up Katniss's romantic life in the final five pages - she ends up with Peeta almost accidentally.  She doesn't choose.  She doesn't even think much about her feelings.  Gale is just gone, without explanation (to take a \\"fancy job\\" in another District) and Peeta is just there, baking bread.  Gradually, Katniss and Peeta grow closer, begin to kiss again, admit they love each other, and get married (all this is explained in one short paragraph).  That's it.  In the novel's epilogue, we learn that Peeta and Katniss have two children, an unnamed boy and girl, who will one day have to be told their parents' roles in the horrible history of their people.  Katniss worries about this.  She still has nightmares.  But things could be much worse, says Collins, so it's OK.  It's also very, very sad.<br /><br />I loved Hunger Games.  I liked Catching Fire.  I appreciate Mockingjay for its courage and its willingness to be \\"real\\" when so many YA novels are not.  This isn't a fantasy series - it's post-apocalyptic fiction that rises to an adult level.  Still, I wish Katniss had been stronger and more self-sufficient.  At one point in the novel she overhears Peeta and Gale talking about their mutual love for her, and Gale predicts she will end up choosing whichever one of them she can't live without.  I almost wish she proved she was strong enough to live without either of them.  In a way, that's the ultimate point of her victory over both the Capitol and District 13.  She is strong enough to act on her own and to act in her own name - or she should be.  This is what is lost in Mockingjay.time, what doesn't work is the novel's ending.

0439023513|5.0|This is a wonderfully written story.  I have a read quite a number of books of varying genre (although I tend to go towards YA and urban fantasy), some of which I had labeled \\"a good read\\", \\"entertaining\\" or even \\"enjoyable\\".  But not until this book have I found a story so gripping.    Suzanne Collins, thank you for this great piece of storytelling which had me run through a gamut of emotions.  When I said I loved \\"The Hunger Games\\", little did I know that it could build to this intensity, the level of tension keeps rising and you feel the fear, anger, and confusion of the players particularly Katniss.    I find that this book advertised/categorized by booksellers as a 12 and up book is appropriate.  For the 12 year-old, it opens your eyes to the realities of war and conflict, and how it changes people, while not being overtly violent and disturbing.  For the above 12 crowd, it is grounded enough in real emotion and experience that it does not feel contrived to hold the attention of the adult reader.    The writing is detailed and not leaving the reader wanting more information on physical setting and background.  The flow of the story is good and even connects current conversations with previous conversations (in the previous books) bringing back the emotions you felt earlier even if the person/circumstance appear to be changed.    I especially liked how I was hanging on to every word since I could not predict how the story would end.  Even when I was at the last chapter (the last 26 pages) I had no idea what the ending would be and I was literally holding my breath (and holding back some tears, this book made me emotional).    To summarize why I love this book:  1.  The plot was unique  2.  It was action-filled  3.  Good characterization (you felt you knew everyone)  4.  Writing was exemplary  5.  Romance was not overt  (comes in small doses, sweet)   6.  Important issues (war and conflict) are introduced to the young reader in a non-disturbing manner  7.  I lovethat I felt every emotion of each of the main characters    I did not write a synopsis of the story because I would like the reader to experience all the emotions I felt when I read this trilogy.  Definitely get this book for your collection.  Timeless.  I expect a lot of publications.  Congratulations to Ms. Collins and thank you for this story.

If Bella and Edward represent such a true and great love, why do they still,even in book FOUR, never sit down, discuss their problems, and work on them together?

B00003CXWV|4.0|I saw Blow (2001) in the theater when it came out and liked it.  This movie stars the versatile Johnny Depp, who, in my opinion, is the best actor of our time.  The guy can do anything.  It also stars the stunning Penelope Cruz, Paul Reubens, and Ray Liotta, another versatile actor.<br /><br />The movie is based on a true story and is about the rise and fall of cocaine dealer George Jung (Johnny Depp).  He at one time was the biggest importer of Colombian cocaine to the U.S.  His partner in crime was the extremely dangerous Pablo Escobar, the famous Colombian drug lord.  In order to achieve his remarkable feats of importing cocaine undetected, Jung had to have great courage, confidence, and determination, which he did.  He seemed to have TOO much confidence.  He paid the price when he got caught.  He gets out of prison and just repeats the very things that landed him in prison to begin with.  The guy's a total loser, one of those repeat offenders that doesn't learn his lessons.  His cocaine dealing dramatically affected the U.S. in that the supply of cocaine on the streets of the U.S. skyrocketed during the 1970s and 1980s.<br /><br />Ray Liotta (Unlawful Entry, Field Of Dreams, Article 99) plays Jung's father.  Penelope Cruz (Vanilla Sky, Nine) plays Jung's wife.  Watching this movie will bring you back to the '70s and '80s.  The clothing, cars, and overall society as it was back then are portrayed accurately.  You'll also hear some rock songs from that era.<br /><br />The acting is very good, especially by Depp and Cruz.<br /><br />This DVD contains excellent special features, some of which are:<br /><br />Beyond the Movie features:<br /><br />George Jung interviews by director Ted Demme<br /><br />Lost Paradise: Cocaine's Impact on Colombia<br /><br />Addiction: Body and Soul<br /><br />Fact Track - Trivia Subtitle Track with direct access to additional features<br /><br />DVD-ROM features:<br /><br />Script-to-Screen access to the movie<br /><br />Link to the original website<br /><br />Exclusive access to online infinifilm features<br /><br />All-Access Pass features:<br /><br />Commentary with director Ted Demme and George Jung<br /><br />Deleted scenes with director commentary<br /><br />Character outtakes<br /><br />Ted Demme's production diary<br /><br />Nikka Costa music video - \\"Push and Pull\\"<br /><br />Teaser and theatrical trailer<br /><br />Cast and crew filmographies<br /><br />All in all, this is an interesting movie that I recommmend for a refreshing change of pace.:    Commentary with director Ted Demme and George Jung    Deleted scenes with director commentary    Character outtakes    Ted Demme's production diary    Nikka Costa music video - \\"Push and Pull\\"    Teaser and theatrical trailer    Cast and crew filmographies      All in all, this is an interesting movie that I recommmend for a refreshing change of pace.

Jack is terrified; he wants to please Ma, but his  mind muddles as they try and commit the ruse.   Jack forgets the order of execution and bumbles the well laid plans....will he and Ma escape.....will Jack be killed by Old Nick as well as Ma or punished beyond humanity?  Read it yourself to find out what happens to this damaged duo who are at opposite ends of the proposed escape.    Emma Donohue deserves the title of great author.  I read \\"Slammerkin\\" a few years back; the story centers on a prostitute and her struggle with living in Ole England.  It was a terrific read.  Now Donoghue embraces the present in a story that is all at once intriguing, intense, horrifying, amusing, and insightful about hostage victims and the world they adapt to. A myriad of emotions are exacted from the reader as they share Jack and Ma's orbit.     I am so appreciative when an author can change subject matter, change streams and yet her prose still flows perfectly.  Consistent brilliance by authors is rare, but Donoghue proves it can happen.    Highly recommended.
B003L77TZI|1.0|Yes, WOW! It's truly sad to see how low the standards for entertainers has fallen with the younger people these days! such mindless drivel! it is almost impossible to find intelligently written and accepted music anymore. it's all about who looks the hottest and how many easily fooled consumers download your cheesy product these days. what a load of overprocessed crap!!!!!
B0036EH3WK|5.0|If I could give it half stars, I would give this a 4 1/2 stars, but I will gladly round this up.    This is a review of the actual package, not the TV series itself, which is excellent.     The package comes in a large box, about the size of a mid-sized board game.   inside well packed is a large brick that is the collection.   The materials are of high quality, this is not a cheap plastic and cardboard, it is high quality plastic/ceramic for the most part, and the series and the extras are nicely packaged to fit into the box.    The box itself is very sturdy, and well made, it will protect your collection from all but the hardest knocks.  The map, which also serves as the top cover is also of high quality production and sturdiness, The senet board is also well made, on par with a high quality chess or checker board that you can get at a hobby store, not made of cheep cardboard. The Episode guide is competent, on par for what you expect, paragraph long summaries of episodes overlaid on images from the series.       I have not opened the black light, but it appears to be of the same build quality as of the \\"Keychain Maglights\\" you can find.  It has a nice Dharma touch to it.  The ankh is solid, and no flimsy, and the senet pecies are actual rock, and not the cheep plastic bits I was expecting.    The smaller pieces of the collection are in little carboard pockets that are beside the actual disks.    The packaging of the disks is decent cardboard, which has some advantages and disadvantages over the typical plastic packaging. They are very easy to take out and put back in, and no worry about breaking the plastic or scratching a disk after watching it.   It is not as durable as Plastic, so you have to be careful not to bend the edges of the sleeves when you put a season in or out.  Each season has its own sleeve.    Blu-Ray Quality    The high definition is of high quality, I have only watched the first disk so far of season one, however it appears that they did a professional job making the disks, and didn't see any major errors in the sound or video quality.   Lost is a lush and wonderfully shot and sounded series, very much near movie quality, and the Blu-Ray really shows this off from the greens if the island, the sounds of the smoke monster, to the wonderfully skilled actors and actresses who make up this ensemble cast.      Not only does it contain a great series (I will let others review the series in general, but Season 1 and 2 are excellent, season 3 is a mix of some of the rare poor episodes to some of the best, and four and five step up the quality.  I have not watched Season six.       This is a great gift or purchase for someone who does not have the series, not only is the series good, but the add-ons and trinkets are very nice.   Also it saves money from buying the seasons on a individual basis.     The only bad thing about the package is that the sleeves corners may get bent after pulling them in and out of the packaging as you watch though the series.
B00006L6YG|4.0|Classic album.  If you love it then you'll definitely want to pick it up if you have SACD capability - excellent sound.  I don't love everything on the album, it's OK if you're in the mood but I do adore The Girl From Ipanema.  If you love the song then actually this is could be worth checking out if you can get it cheap.  Its never sounded better - awesome.  Album & 45 version!  Have fun!
0439023513|5.0|Most excellent. Suzanne Collins once again brings the A-game. Holding nothing back, and always adding that unexpected twist (or two, or three).    See full review at [...]  Suzanne Collins takes you once again in a roller coaster ride where you feel constantly at the edge of your seat. Lots of twist and turns, excitement, but also with the brutality and reality of a world in war.    This is a story of war, not love; and the consequences war brings upon the ones who play a role in it. And Suzanne doesn't sugar coat anything, so don't expect this story to be a happy ever after. It does, however, brings you a sense of finality.     Perfect ending to this series; and Suzanne does a great job with the realism that other authors sometimes fail to bring.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|This is a TOP RATED ALBUM; every single song is very good, you can hear the whole CD again and again... It was about time for something like this...
B000062XGD|5.0|I had seen this movie before, but wanted a copy of my own.  Found it on Amazon at a reasonable price and purchased it.  It was priced fairly and arrived quickly in excellent condition.
0316017922|5.0|Outliers is a fantastic read. If Gladwell started out this book with the intention of changing one's perspective on how success is achieved, he has without a doubt succeeded.<br /><br />He breaks down success with the 10,000 hour rule and the legacy of culture, all of which make perfect sense. If you have not realized yet, Gladwell has the uncanny ability to point out things that we overlook. He does it flawlessly here with stories of successful software billionaires, lawyers and doctors.<br /><br />An interesting bit in this book is as personal as it gets, Gladwell's breakdown of his mother as an outlier. A set of perfectly timed events centuries ago that result in her ending up in Canada.<br /><br />The word Interesting does not do justice to this book. I highly recommend it.
B003EYVXYG|2.0|When I purchased this movie, I was excited to pop it in my player and view the new Romero masterpiece. However, right from the start, I had a feeling that the master of the undead had lost his touch with this one. The tale mixes in your basic macho, swearing, smoking military types who never flinch when they see a zombie. Their always cool, collected and light their butts on the flaming head of the undead before they karate kick the corps into a river. Couple this with bad jokes that are supposed to make the film funny, but fail.. And the irish talking cowboys that live on an island off the coast of delaware and you have mixed bag of cardboard characters and a healthy dose of unrealism that set the stage for a pretty sloppy movie. It seemed like Romero wanted to set his new movie in the old west, but wasn't able to do so because of the undead timeline of his previous works. So he invented a group of characters that lived in the modern day, but were gross throwbacks to a time beyond the new modern era. Imagine people in 2010 dressing like cowboys, riding horses and speaking with perfect irish accents. The zombies were nothing more than a poor backdrop to the thin storyline of this movie.. On the whole, this movie was not about survivors trying to prolong their lives during the zombie uprising.. it was about a ridiculous feud between two families and the living dead were just another ingredient in the stew. Maybe this one will grow on me as I view it again in the future, some movies are like that. But I can't give this one high marks right from the starting gate. Survival of the dead will grace my movie shelf and add to my Romero collection, but I hope he does better in the future if he decides to do another zombie flick..
B00004W50Z|5.0|I've never been a huge fan of the Band, however I believe Stage Fright is convincing me to look at roots rock in a whole new light.<br /><br />The songs written in a stripped down roots rock kind of way such as \\"Strawberry Wine\\", \\"Time to Kill\\" and \\"The W.S. Walcott Medicine Show\\" are simply *fantastic*.  Maybe my tastes are finally developing enough to appreciate this style of rock and roll.<br /><br />I mean, I've always loved their 1969 self-titled album, but mostly because the vocal melodies on that album are sung in a very sad and honest style.  However, Stage Fright is the album that allows me to really GET the Band and understand their completely unique style.<br /><br />The ballads are really good too... er, maybe not \\"true\\" ballads in the typical sense, but these particular songs are definitely quite sad and trigger an emotional response out of me.  \\"Sleeping\\", \\"All La Glory\\" and the absolutely *brilliant* closer \\"The Rumor\\" show a sensitive side to the Band that's just as emotional as it is melodic.<br /><br />Oh, and another thing- these guys write some terrific lyrics.  I didn't give them enough credit for that initially.  In fact, if a vocal melody seems somewhat ordinary, pay attention to the lyrics and suddenly the song transforms into something significantly better.  That's been my experience with their music, at least.<br /><br />The title song has a wonderful chorus, and \\"Daniel and the Sacred Harp\\" is solid proof these guys are not your ordinary American band.<br /><br />In fact, implementing the accordion into their music is one thing, but the way they play those organs is going to haunt me forever.  I can't explain it -and the Who used to do the same thing in the late 60's- but those organs are always played in a way that makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck (and I actually HAVE hair on the back of my neck now- it grew there over the last year!)<br /><br />Anyway, Stage Fright is a masterpiece.  If the sadness and the honesty in the lyrics doesn't win you over, perhaps the band members being professionals in the roots rock genre will allow you to see what the big deal is concerning these guys.rs being professionals in the roots rock genre will allow you to see what the big deal is concerning these guys.
B003JTHESA|5.0|Unfortunately, I know a few men in their mid to late forties who have not changed much since the days of their youth. They may be balding, but that doesn't discourage them from growing what hair they have left as long as possible. They still wear Slayer T-shirts, drink copious amounts of alchohol, and gather at a friends house to party and play video games every Saturday night. They still bang their heads and love any music that's speedy and thrashy. They despise the sound of an acoustic guitar and are driven to the brink of a psychotic break when a band matures musically or becomes too complex for them to wrap their fried minds around.  And then, there are those who may not be in such a zombified state in life.. but somehow they just can't seem to move beyond the music they listened to when they were seventeen. They hold their breath and pray each night that Guns n Roses will release a duplicate of appetite for destruction. They want Janie Lane to rejoin Warrant and hit us with another cherry pie and curse God for not letting Led Zeppelin reunite and record Houses of the holy, book two. It is, sadly, these two groups of individuals that will be making a noose out of the nearest extension chord when they hear the new Maiden album.  I was not a fan of Iron Maiden until the release of Somewhere in time. I since enjoyed every release they have put out and appreciated the progressive and folk elements that they have blended into their music. This is not a band for the dead head who wants to puff on some wacky weed and play Mike Tyson's punch out. Nor have they become a group that will be the musical savior for those wishing for the second coming of Killers. The Final frontier certainly is a bit more progressive and mellow in spots than a lot of other Maiden material. Some of the songs are a shock to the ears when you first hear them. The album is somewhat musically complex, but not overly opus like. The songs are long and try to be epics in their own right. Sometimes the melodies seem a little obscure and then change up as the music goes from mellow to Maiden. The lyrics are more for the thinking man, and God help the aged hippies, but we have some acoustic guitar and keyboards here.  In the end however, the album is a darn good one and anyone who has enjoyed Maiden's musical maturity since Somewhere in time onward, will find a gem and some very good tunes here. If you loved all of Maiden's albums even more since Brave new world and beyond, then this one is going to floor you with awesomness. However, if you can balance a beer can on your lips and chug while you rank up the high scores on asteroid, or tearfully pray the rosary over Powerslave each night.. then this album will make you taste the cold edge of your daddy's razor blade.
0439023513|1.0|Let me begin by saying I adored the first two books. I've been waiting eagerly for months for Mockingjay, and now that I've read it I'm disturbed and disappointed. This book casts a pall over the first two, and much as I loved them I don't know that I can read them again now that I know how the characters end up. Mockingjay goes in a completely different direction than books 1 and 2, but it's a direction no wise author should have taken.     SPOILER ALERT    In the first two Hunger Games books, it was always worth giving your life if it could make life better for those who come after you. In Mockingjay, people--good, kind people whom we knew for hundreds of pages and loved like friends--die left and right IN VAIN. Katniss's mission to kill Snow ends with most of her friends dead (in horrible ways) and Snow still alive. Snow eventually dies and Panem is free--but life's not a whole lot better than it was.  Peeta, whom I think everyone loved (I know I did), becomes a monster who's been stripped of the sweet, devoted love he had for Katniss, which is what made him so completely charming in the earlier books. Katniss is impatient with him, cruel to him, and at several points coldly considers putting an arrow through his brain, which doesn't ring true given their relationship in books 1 and 2. He recovers some, and marries Katniss (who doesn't seem terribly excited about that), but HE'S NEVER THE SAME. She's never the same. She's estranged from Gale, and her mother, and Prim's dead. (I couldn't believe this; I kept turning pages thinking it had to be a terrible mistake, Collins couldn't be foolish enough to destroy the last pure, good person in Panem.) The final point of the book seems to be, \\"Well, life sucks, but it could be worse.\\" Yeah, thanks, I'm so glad I read 900 pages to come to that conclusion.    The book feels rushed, and there are many passages that are unclear. For instance, why does Katniss vote in favor of a 76th  Hunger Games? Does she really want revenge for Prim, or does she just want Coin to trust her enough to let her onto the platform? Was she thinking of killing Coin at that point, or was it an impulse she got later? This is crucial information that says volumes about Katniss's character, and IT SHOULDN'T BE SO VAGUE. I'm all for subtlety, but not for downright obscurity.     Ultimately, I FEEL BETRAYED. The first two books were wonderful, but they'll never be the same now that we know the grim, depressing fate to which Collins condemns her characters (those she doesn't kill off, that is). Mockingjay is dark and disturbing, with no redemption for the characters or reward for the readers. War is an atrocity, life can be terrible--we know that. That's why fiction exists: to be different. To tell stories, not to send messages. I would rather have been left hanging after Catching Fire and never have known what happened in what was one of my all-time favorite stories than to have it end like this.
B001J8DU4A|5.0|I was so amazed to see how quickly I received this CD. Great Shipping and wonderful seller.

B0026P3G12|1.0|Someone gave me this cd because they thought one trained singer would enjoy another. I listened to the whole cd then tossed it in the trash. Can she sing? well I'll be nice enough to say that she does sing better than the average person but her lack of training is very evident. It has led me to the conclusion that she is highly overrated and, as another person put it, if she was beautiful instead of a homely middle aged fat women she wouldn't even be on people's radar. It's sad that this dribble is considered \\"great music\\" by so many people. But then again, most people don't really understand great music any ways and tend to like whatever record executives tell them to like, like little robots. It's truly sad to see someone like her praised when there are so many superior, well trained, vocally impressive singers out there that go unnoticed because they don't have Simon Cowell to pimp them out to the public.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|This is easy. Episode IV was awesome. Episode V is the best, and Episode VI was also some awesome job of a film, but not as awesome as Episode V. Episode I was terrible except for the Jedi vs. Sith lightsaber battle, but still the rest of the movie sucks. Episode II was quite terrible as well, but the Jedi vs. Sith lightsaber battle was pretty cool. Episode III was easily better than I & II, if only that Jar-Jar Binks doesn't talk at all in the film. Episode III did have some bad acting and some terrible writing, but was a decent film overall.<br /><br />This is a mixed package. Honestly, I'd advise getting Episodes IV - VI on Blu-ray Disc and Episodes I - III on DVD.
0060254920|5.0|Where The Wild Things Are is an incredible imaginative story that is fun to read.  The illustrations and cover are amazing.  The story is about a boy named Max who escapes to a mysterious land full of strange creatures.  This book is a classic and for good reason....  great read.

B003VMIGM8|3.0|A film that works as both a mild psychological thriller and a brief portrait of a marriage in tatters, Chloe is grounded solely by its otherwise stellar cast. Rising star Amanda Seyfried plays the titular character, an alluring icy blond escort who is hired by Catherine (Julianne Moore), a doctor who suspects that her professor husband David (Liam Neeson) is cheating her. Chloe's job is simple; lure the husband into a compromising position and see if he takes the bait. But what begins as a simple plan quickly turns into something much more complex and potentially devastating for all parties involved. The mounting tension among the film's two core relationships promises much during the film's running time, but it drifts into its third act in a manner that ultimately sabotages the story and keeps it from becoming something truly memorable, ending with more of a whisper versus a bang. While it cleverly uses the classic psycho-sexual thriller Fatal Attraction as a worthy framework, Chloe took the premise and gave it a refreshing twist and that alone is worth giving it a rental viewing. Aside from that, view the film for what should be regarded as Amanda Seyfried's breakout performance. If anything should be remembered after walking away, it's that the young doe-eyed actress definitely has the talent to pull of a serious role.

0596806027|4.0|HTML5 is the latest \\"big deal\\" in web development, and for good reason. It allows us to build interactive websites without the need for add-ons like Adobe Flash. But it's also the foundation of a whole new class of deliverables like iOS apps, iTunes LP, iTunes Extras, and iAds. And while those are all Apple-related right now, there's no reason they can't be used everywhere once IE9 ships. The downside is that HTML5 is not complete, and it won't be for a long time. But what most people think of as HTML5 is actually a combination of HTML, CSS and Javascript. Right now. While you can find an endless supply of books for each, none has yet covered the new context of manipulating DOM elements (or even explaining DOM elements), the canvas, local storage and all the other new goodies.<br /><br />That's where the gold rush brings us in 2010. A number of \\"HTML5\\" books were promised as early as last November, only to be delayed again and again. \\"HTML5: Up and Running\\" from O'Reilly immediately went to the top of my watch list, since I have a shelf of O'Reilly books already and it would be in good company. It too was pushed back from the original release date, but not by much, and now I have it in my grubby fingers, and it was worth the wait. Mostly.<br /><br />The first chapter is quick reading, and actually pretty interesting considering it's just a history of HTML. Old emails from names like Marc Andreessen and Tim Berners-Lee arguing over the img tag, and how we ultimately ended up with the current format, are entertaining. Ok, next. Chapter 2 covers compatibility, since not all web browsers support every piece of the HTML5 moving target, and how to detect if your visitor can see what you're trying to show them. Then we get a detailed but quick run-through on canvas, 2-D drawing, video codecs, geo-location, local data storage, offline web apps and new form elements. Chapter 10 wraps things up by future-proofing HTML5 and sneaking microdata annotations into your code, and tries to lay down some standards for different types of data in a way compatible with Google's Rich Snippets. This is followed by a very handy alphabetical guide to detecting the new stuff, and a standard index.<br /><br />What's not to like? Well, by the time I finish typing this sentence some of the topics in the book may have changed. Those changes are likely documented somewhere online for free. Three days ago, for example, the MPEG LA group declared that H.264 video will be royalty-free forever. That could set it up as the favored web video standard going forward. Not that this makes the nine pages on encoding Ogg Theora video a waste, but maybe more time could have been spent on interactive UI elements, animation, CSS or 3-D drawing inside the browser instead of external video generation. And when I said \\"quick run-through\\" of some elements, I meant it. The chapter on forms, for example, shows how to fall back when using the new autofocus tag, by using Javascript for older browsers. But it doesn't have any fallback example for the placeholder tag at all.<br /><br />This book is a foothold, however, and a necessary step to fill the holes in one's background.

0393324818|5.0|A brilliant book. It talks about sport in it's widest application - which to my mind is the only reason we truly love sport. Billy Beane clearly is a maniac, but he just makes the other GM's of Baseball teams appear certifiably insane. How do you justify, as a business person, giving a rookie, who's created no financial return on his effort thus far, millions of dollars? It's a Capitalist oxymoron! It's no wonder Joe(the poison dwarf)Morgan yells foul. He, along with the Women's Auxiliary Club members, want to continue to be overpaid for their old ideas and insist on regurgitated them into the present. 'The Good old times are over, Joe!' Get a real job!<br /><br />The real hero of this story is Bill James who has the true American spirit to challenge the sacred cows of Baseball. I'm not a follower of Baseball, but this book and the work of Bill James, Paul DePodesta, Voros McCracken, Dick Cramer and others, reinforces the American spirit of innovation that we dearly need in this time of our history. A great thanks to Michael Lewis who had the talent, courage and persistence to see this project through. He's done a great service to the American people by offering a way we can take back our national sport from the hypocrites and bottom feeders. I can't wait until the movie comes out and these worms of incompetence are exposed for the lice that they really are.
B003INBOE2|5.0|Go add to your cart already so you can be amazed by the time this movie lands in your mailbox.
B003UYUR0G|5.0|I really liked this movie. It had some of the most beautiful scenery I've seen in a film in a long time. While a lot of it was computer generated imagery, these effects were still quite spectacular! The music was great too, a little reminiscent of Pirates of the Caribbean, but powerful enough to move the story.<br /><br />The story was simple enough; Orphan adopted by the King becomes a prince and conquers another kingdom, captures a mysterious princess and finds a powerful weapon, the Dagger of Time. He then is framed for regicide, and flees with the Princess. They run into a gamblers' camp and cause more mischief. The Prince learns the dagger unlocks the sands of time which can rewind time and if misused will unleash armageddon. After watching those he cares about die one by one, and teaming up with the gamblers, the Prince stops the plot that started with his framing and would have ended in the destruction of the world.<br /><br />There are a lot of acrobatic chase scenes and swashbuckling fight scenes throughout, and the landscape and views of fictional Persian cities are breath-taking. The parts in between can seem a little dull in comparison, but serve the purpose of building the story and relationship between the Prince and Princess.<br /><br />Overall, this movie was just a lot of fun to watch over and over again! I saw it in theaters several times and I can't wait to buy it on Blu-ray.
B002VPE1B6|3.0|Once again, a movie where white people seek to destroy the exotic \\"other\\" out of greed and it is up to the white people to save them.    Instead of Native Americans (Dances With Wolves), Asians (The Last Samurai), Africans (Blood Diamond) or African Americans (Freedom Writers, Dangerous Minds and similar ilk) we now have the Na'vi, CGI blue people living in Cameron's idealized Eden.    Non-memorable dialogue, a predictable plot and characters in full stereotype.    BUT...the special effects are incredible.  Watch it for the visual stimuli but we've seen this all before.
0439023491|5.0|I jumped into \\"Catching Fire\\" the minute I received it in my package from Amazon. \\"Hunger Games\\" ended on quite the cliffhanger and I was eager to pick up where I had left off.  This book does pick up after Katniss and Peeta are back from the Hunger Games and living in the Victor's homes.  Things should be fairly good for them now.  A new home, tons of food for them as well as the other citizens in District 12.  Its not because Katniss's act of rebellion at the end of \\"Hunger Games\\" has made her a target of the Capital.  President Snow makes it clear he wishes he could kill her for what she has done.<br /><br />I can't give much more synopsis without giving spoilers away and there are more then enough of those reviews already for this trilogy.  I will say that a lot of other readers have complained that the book starts off too slow.  I thought the beginning was perfect. So often in this series there is one adventure after another and I think this 'slower' part of the book was necessary so readers could really get a chance to know the characters and their motivations.<br /><br />The second half of the book is the non stop action we have come to expect in this series.  I think it was even harder seeing these people die because I defintely felt like I knew these characters better than I knew those in the first book.  The book ends on another heck of a cliffhanger and so I am grateful that I have newly released \\"Mockingjay\\" waiting to go.  This is definitely a must read series and I personally believe it is worth the hype that surrounds it.  I am even going to pass this onto my 13 year old son who is the only member of our family that is NOT a reader.
B003F3NDP8|3.0|Desperate Housewives has been one of my favorite shows to ever hit television since it debuted in 2005. Season 5 was probably the weakest in my opinion although it did feature some extraordinary episodes luckily Season 6 is an improvement. There is good and bad in this season. The new family is pretty interesting however I feel a lot of the storylines were recycled much like season 5 and the show ultimately suffers without Nicolette Sheridans character Edie. The actresses are likely the best of tv especially Marcia Cross, Felicity Hoffman, and Eva Longoria they all truly shine but without the fire and ice of Nicolette Sheridan there is no confrontation and crack up moments between the ladies and its a shame since Sheridans character brought a much needed and appreciated brutal honesty to the series. Still a good season not great though but better than season 5 and hopefully season 7 will bring us back to the housewives we love and get them back on top so we don't have to bury this series too soon.

0439023513|5.0|Having thoroughly enjoyed the first two installments in the Hunger Games series, I was a little skeptical about Collins' ability to keep the scheme alive and effectively tie up all the loose ends in this, the final installment in the trilogy. Turns out, my fears were totally unwarranted. Although the first book was my favorite (probably because I like the Games parts best), I loved Mockingjay. The story starts in August, picking up about a month after Catching Fire left off. Peeta remains a captive of the Capitol, which vengefully wreaked havoc on the Rebels for their part in the last Hunger Games. The Rebels formulate a bold plan requiring significant involvement on the part of 17-year-old Katniss. Although she's upset about how it all went down at the end of the last Games, she agrees, with conditions, to participate. To say much more might spoil the best of the book: a fast-paced plot with some cool new technologies, an interesting propaganda campaign, some decent twists, and the resolution of the (G-rated) Katniss-Peeta-Gale love triangle. My two tiny complaints would be that (1) the section of sustained action doesn't begin until pretty late in the book and (2) the author's decision to take the fate of the K-P-G relationship out of the hands of one of those involved is a bit of a letdown. The Hunger Games series, one of my all-time favorites, is as action packed as it is original. Also good: Maximum Ride by James Patterson, The Book of Lost Things by John Connelly (rated PG), and A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket.

0316017922|3.0|Although the factors author Malcolm Gladwell puts forth as coming into play and the data he uses to support his claims about outliers, which he describes as,  (p 17), \\"men and women who do things that are out of the ordinary,\\" are generally interesting, most are unsurprising. He contends that, (p 18) \\"there is something profoundly wrong with the way we make sense of success,\\" and (p 19) \\"People don't rise from nothing...they are invariably the beneficiaries of hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural legacies that allow them to learn and work hard and make sense of the world in ways that others cannot.\\" One wouldn't need much more than a little common sense to conclude that a person needs more than just a high IQ to achieve success (the other required component he calls, \\"practical intelligence\\"). The same is true for such things as the fact that athletes (and students) with birth dates placing them on the elder end of the spectrum of those making up a pool of potential standouts in academics and athletics do better than their youngest peers. Having a special talent (low supply) at the right time in history (high demand) is also likely to yield benefits. That children of parents who teach them special skills; kids who place the value of hard work over that of innate intelligence; and those who spend a significant time practicing their craft (independent of their initial aptitude for it) have a higher chance of success is also no surprise.<br /><br />My biggest gripe about the data, of which most of us know can often be framed with a little effort to support opposing views, is that about education. Specifically, Gladwell contends that (p 259) \\"[between] September and June...Schools work,\\" in support of his claim that (p 258), \\"when it comes to reading skills, poor kids learn nothing when school is not in session.\\" I agree that one of the reasons that other countries' students perform better than American kids academically is that their students' schools are in session longer, but I disagree wholeheartedly that kids from poor families do comparably well as those from middle and high income families during the school year. In my state, Washington, low-income students (those who qualify for free or reduced price lunch) overwhelmingly perform significantly worse on state tests (WASL/MSP) than those who don't by a wide margin in every tested subject and in every tested grade.<br /><br />In summary, while Outliers provides food for thought (and plenty of facts and figures), Gladwell's primary contention, that several fortuitous circumstances combined trump one single significant factor when it comes to predicting a person's success, is simply sensible.

0439023513|4.0|Mockingjay by Suzanne Collins has certainly been one of the most anticipated titles this year, bringing to a close the trilogy that began with The Hunger Games and continued with Catching Fire.  The Hunger Games was a captivating, compelling read--one of my favorite reads that year--and Catching Fire was close to it in quality; though different in pace and tone, it maintained a strong sense of character and character growth.  So does Collins manage to recapture the fire in Mockingjay?  To be honest, it's a bit mixed.     In book one, the games were, well, the games (I won't explain on the assumption you already know that the Hunger Games are).  In book two, the games broaden though by the end we're back in the literal games via the Quarter Quell.  In Mockingjay, the \\"games\\" have broadened once more, becoming all-out war between the districts, led by District 13, and the Capital and with Katniss their sometimes reluctant symbol of resistance, a symbol \\"employed\\" by District 13 via propaganda shoots, cameras that follow her around, scripted \\"rebel\\" lines, etc.  The parallels between the preparation and execution of the war and Katniss' earlier experiences with the games is drawn clearly for the reader (at times perhaps too much so--this was the first of the books where I felt the author aiming clearly at a YA audience that might need a bit more help):  where she trained for the arena, she now trains as a soldier; where she was primped and made up for the audience of the games for a better show, she's now primped and made up for the audience to better manipulate them into resisting.  Collins does a good job making these parallels clear, but also showing Katniss' reluctant acceptance of them while she's also often repulsed by them.  She also does a good job at the obvious--war is not in fact a game--and so, like its predecessors Mockingjay is filled with deaths, lots of them and some quite powerful.  The war scenes we see will as well seem disturbingly familiar, many ofthem akin to terrorism or scenes from Iraq: with the pods as IEDs, human shields, civilian casualties, etc.     Where Collins runs into some trouble is toward the end of the book when the \\"games\\" aspect becomes a bit too literal and the resistance has to run a gauntlet of killer \\"pods\\" in the city streets a la the creative death-dealing in the arenas.  This feels a bit too contrived, a bit too much been-there-done-that, and trivializes somewhat the war aspect.  The pods also don't seem to make much logistical sense and seem somewhat random. Actually, the entire logistical aspect is the weakest part of the novel--the exterior world-building beyond the narrow focus on the arenas--has always been thin, but one could ignore it in the earlier works. Here, though, with the plot being painted across all the districts and then in the entire city of the Capital, we needed a clearer, more concrete, more full vision of how the world works.  We get the war in a few scenes but mostly as snippets and it becomes a shock toward the end when the results are simply declared and then again when one realizes just how far it's gone (vague, I know, but I don't want to ruin plot).     The plot also has some pacing issues, some parts flying along and others stuttering through: the opening is a bit slow, as are some of the training scenes, and a scene involving the bombing of District 13 is both slow and strangely disconnected, and also calls up some basic questions of logistics.  There are a few other plot points I had issues with, but they involve some spoilers so won't go into them.     Character is a bit more tricky than plot in this one. Katniss' character has always carried the reader through via her strength, her active role and sharply compelling voice. In Mockingjay, however, she's much more passive as she's forced, often reluctantly but eventually willingly, into being a propaganda tool by District 13's President Coin.  We get flashes of her vibrant will as she defies orders at various times, but mostly she's reacting to people and events and within a relatively constrained perimeter.  She's also in much more confused water than the \\"kill or be killed\\" and \\"stay alive\\" world of the arena.  It isn't quite clear whom to trust, politics is inherently shadowy, she's both the target and tool of propaganda, it's unclear to whom or to what principles to remain loyal, it's unclear as to what methods are justifiable:  can one use the methods of one's enemies without being the same as them?     This passivity and confusion is essential to the book; in fact, I'd say it's the major point, but it makes for a less shallowly-satisfying read. Mockingjay is a different kind of book, and a deeper book, but that costs the book a bit in that it loses that thrill-ride aspect of the first two.  Personally, I like that she's done something different, but some readers may bemoan the edge-of-the-seat, always-driving-forward, kick-ass heroine aspects of the first two books.  Beyond Katniss, the other characters vary in depth and quality. Gale becomes a symbol of the \\"win at all costs\\" while Peeta, for complex reasons, argues for a ceasefire to spare lives. Gale suffers a bit from one-dimensionality, but Peeta is nicely complex and shaded, as is Katniss' former mentor Haymitch. Prim, Katniss' sister, isn't on stage much but when she is she in some ways dominates in a quietly forceful and often poignant fashion.       This trilogy has always had a darker, more realistic bent.  Too often we see the young, plucky hero (male or female) overcome all odds and defeat the bad guys/dark lord/dystopian leaders with only a single loss or two, required for emotional effect.  Collins shows us how much that is childish wishful thinking.  Kat doesn't get to make all the choices here, she suffers more than a single loss or two, as do those around her; her decisions cause others pain, and the band of good guys she's surrounded by (the fellowship, if you will) is a lot more grey thanwhite.  The muddiness of the world and war logistics is a major weakness in Mockingjay and means this conclusion isn't as good as the first two books in some ways, but the other reasons the book doesn't \\"satisfy\\" are essential to the book's realistic vision of people and the world as it is, which make Mockingjay a powerful and fitting conclusion.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|I was so excited for this series.  Unfortunately, I was fooled a bit by the title.  it is called Life but it is full of Death.

0307594777|5.0|I found the three books in this series the most fascinating that I have read in a very long time.  I would advise any reader to read them in order beginning with \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\", next \\"The Girl who Played with Fire\\" and ending with \\"The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest\\".  There is definitely an order to the continued story.  The two leading charactors, Mickael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander, are both very strong charactors even though they are very different in background and profession.  I would further advise any reader to try to read thee three books while on vacation or at least on a holiday weekend as you will find it difficult to put them aside on just an evening's reading.   As a retired senior citizen, I was able to devote an entire week to their reading and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

I finally put the book aside, not even caring if the heroine ever gets the man who makes her heart thrill, or any man at all.

B003O85W3A|4.0|How many downstroked eighth and sixteenth notes on acoustic guitar can one album have? Come and see!<br /><br />I do love the sincerity and depth that AF strives toward, and they have some glorious moments here, lyrically most of all, but let's be honest: a lot of these tunes sound like a lot of these other tunes---almost suburbanly cookie-cutterish--- and there are precious few memorable melodies. It's all about mood, but it's mainly that one Arcade Fire mood...perhaps a distillation of their own memories of suburban angst? With each downstroke we bury thee, thoughts of impending gloom! When Month Of May shows up it seems like a punky breath of fresh air...until one realizes it's just another fest of downstroked 16th-notes, only this time on electric gits.<br /><br />If I was still in my teens this might be manna from heaven, in all its ineluctable inscrutability. Honestly, I miss that period when music grabbed me by the you-know-whats and meant everything. If you're right there with this right now, god bless you: enjoy it to the hilt while you have it. At some point you'll have heard so many records that it will all blend together and that special wallop of newness will be a rare and special memory. Savor it now.<br /><br />I can see how this might have that for some, but for me it's all a little bit too homogeneous. Yet it's still got that sheen of unique it-ness that distinguished OK Computer and other modern classics. It doesn't quite grab me that strongly, but maybe I haven't given it enough spins yet.<br /><br />The lyrics do have some sweet points (AF aren't afraid to use their brains, their greatest asset), and this could easily become an anthem for many suburban kids, emo-version 2.0, semi-beta.<br /><br />It doesn't sound like anything else except the last AF album, and there's nothing wrong with that.

B0009WFFS6|5.0|One of the most articulate reviews about the Cream Reunion DVD posted anywhere can be found on Amazon by Mr. Packer.  He points out that the reason for the reunion is not important, it's all about the music.    Since many Cream fans were not around for the original genius and for decades it looked like we could never witness one of the best bands ever, this would be worth any price to own.    The beauty of the music is Eric/Jack/Ginger are not going through the motions.  The energy level is high, there is fun in their eyes, and with all the health issues Jack Bruce in his 60's still has vocal pipes that can move a mountain.    I went down to the crossroads and think I'll stay for awhile.    Thanks to a power trio that has made my life fuller.

B002ZG997C|5.0|Every once in a while Hollywood comes out with a movie which is both prophetic and spiritual in nature. Granted, this movie has some very good action in it; however, that is not the important theme of it: It is all about spiritual warfare. This wonderful movie is about a man (Eli ~ Denzel Washington) whom was given a purpose (mission) by GOD to deliver a Bible to a given destination. Eli is tested (persecuted) in many various ways along his way (path, walk) in the desert.  These tests were physical, psychological, sexual and spiritual in order to test his faith, strength and determination.  What is obvious here is that Eli followed the Gospel, and people came out of the wood-work to destroy him and his \\"walk\\" in the LORD.  Although they tried to recruit him, they finally sent an Army after him because Eli wouldn't conform to their world and kept on his walk of faith foot-by-foot.  What is not obvious to Eli's enemies is that he is supernaturally protected during all of his trials and tribulations.  After watching this movie for the 4th time, I finally realized that Eli was blind and the LORD walked him through every event in a supernatural way:  Just like the famous line in the movie, \\"I walk by faith and not by sight.\\"  What seems prophetic in this movie is that people will eventually kill for Bibles and the Word of the LORD:  Bibles will eventually become very valuable in the future because there will be very few of them around.

0439023513|4.0|Damn Suzanne Collins, anyway. I had plans for this sunny Saturday in Cali, and then her book finally shows up in the mail. If it sounds like I'm grousing, I'm not, really. MOCKINGJAY is a riveting read, and it nicely caps off what I think is the best trilogy of novels to have come out in recent years. Suzanne Collins holds you spellbound with the raw power in her prose and her ability to make you emotionally invested, make you well up, make your throat clench up. I was spent when I got done reading the thing, and already missing the girl on fire something fierce.<br /><br />The Hunger Games trilogy offers the very best of futuristic, post-apocalyptic stories. It is thought-provoking and sometimes very painful to read, and it all hinges on the vast appeal of Katniss Everdeen, who is only seventeen years old but who of late has led a hell of a life. In MOCKINGJAY, Collins expands the canvas. The closing pages of the book before, CATCHING FIRE, informed us that an underground rebellion had been quietly fomenting, deep within the previously thought to be extinct District 13, and this rebellion - ignited by Katniss's inspirational derring-do in the Games - comes to the fore in MOCKINGJAY, seeking to overthrow the corrupt, decadent rule of the Capitol. Televised during the Hunger Games, Katniss had become a beloved figure in the eyes of the people, and District 13 taps her as the ideal rallying point, whether she wants this or not. Katniss Everdeen, deeply conflicted, guilt-ridden, has always been a reluctant hero. We open with her in a daze and forlornly wandering the rubble of her destitute mining hometown, District 12, which months ago had been firebombed by the Capitol as a warning.<br /><br />I think we all knew from the very start that Katniss would play a key role in overthrowing the Capitol, but Collins still makes it a compelling tale. We've come to expect certain things from this series, and the writer again strongly delivers. The Capitol is still despicable down to its roots, but Katniss discovers that the ruling council in District 13 may also harbor a shady agenda. Katniss is reunited with her mother and younger sister, Prim, and with her childhood friend Gale. But she's haunted by Peeta's captivity in the Capitol. And, once again, she's being manipulated. As the figurehead of the revolution, Katniss again has to go in front of the camera, try to put on an act, try to inspire the downtrodden. We learn that Katniss is utter disaster with coached lines, that she fares a lot better when thrown on the field of battle where she can be spontaneous and real and riveting. Where she can be the Mockingjay, the girl on fire.<br /><br />Cripes, what a stunning trilogy, and what a remarkable book Suzanne Collins has again come up with, full of humanity (and inhumanity) and grace and heartbreak and wrenching choices and, yes, those electrifying moments that get you in the guts. There is a striking richness to the characters, even side characters like Johanna and Boggs and Katniss's flighty prep team. Katniss, of course, stands head and shoulders above the rest. Katniss Everdeen, a hunter with uncanny marksmanship, is unforgettable not only when she springs into action but in those reflective moments as well. I do like that there's a whiff of a Q element introduced here. Like Q from the James Bond mythos, there is a character in this book named Beetee who comes up with some very cool gadgets, and this includes hi-tech black bow and arrows for Katniss.<br /><br />Terrible things happen in this book which I wish hadn't, and Collins goes down an even darker, bleaker path, and her story has never been as simple as good versus evil, anyway. And just when you start thinking the writer had veered away from the Hunger Games, Katniss finds herself returning to another arena. Or close enough, anyway. Something wonky happens with the pacing. There's almost this fake ending, when events build up to a harrowing, breakneck crescendo as Katniss andcompany desperately try to stay alive, and this dystopian world has created inventive, supremely horrifying ways for people to die. But then the pace slows down for the final, final act, and it just wasn't the way I thought it would end (although, to be honest, I wasn't sure, really, how it would end). There's a resolution to that whole Peeta vs. Gale thing, and in this book Gale finally gets ample screen time. And Peeta? What happens to the boy with the bread doesn't make Katniss's choice any easier. But this series isn't really about the love triangle. Suzanne Collins always had a more important message to impart, and that had more to do with the senselessness and depravity of waging war.<br /><br />How this volume ends, it's not entirely gratifying. There's deep bittersweet sadness and a sense of people drifting apart and even a dose of cynicism. The writer doesn't exactly give you what you want. And, in a way, I appreciate this ending because it feels more real than any routine happily ever afters would have felt. Sometimes and often, things don't climax to a rousing song and dance, but taper off with only a tired sigh. Katniss Everdeen, the girl on fire, is gonna stick around in my brain for a long while.

0316010669|4.0|It seems like a lot of reviews have spent a lot of time bemoaning what \\"Blink\\" isn't.  It isn't a self-help guide that will teach you \\"how to harness the power of thin slicing to win at business, cards, love, and the stock market\\" which it seems is what a lot of Americans are looking for.  To me - it seems more like an examination of the fact that we've become so data driven in the workforce that we've lost some of the balance between informed decisions based on data and 'gut feel.'  I would also say that Gladwell didn't lay out a map of \\"this is how you, too, can thin slice\\" because it would be different for each of us depending on background, experience, the purpose we wish to achieve, etc. etc. etc.  Instead - it's a personal responsibility to think about the ways that you make decisions and ways that you may be overwhelming yourself with data rather than doing something that comes naturally.    Overall - I enjoyed the book for what it was and it made me spend time thinking about the different ways that I make decisions.  I found the examples interesting - but maybe that's because I'm an Army officer that works in the medical field that has a car salesman for a father (all of these play a role in the book).  It seems to wander a little at times and not all of the examples seem relevant to me, though.

Sans the musical notes that dance from Julie Andrews, Emma Thompson's character provides the sane sense of ease and comfort, while teaching a horde of little demons how to behave properly.<br /><br />I have to say that Emma Thompson delivers a perfect performance in this film. She's everything that a frazzled mother Mrs. Isabel Green (Maggie Gyllenhaal) could wish for, especially during the trying times of World War II. Ewan McGregor plays her husband, who is off fighting the war. As often occurred during those times, he has left his young wife behind to care for the homestead and their rapscallion brood of children Norman, Megsie and Vincent. As if times weren't trying enough, the situation becomes worse when their spoiled cousins come to stay with them, escaping the Blitz.<br /><br />While Mr. Green is away, his rotten brother Phil (Rhys Ifans) pressures Isabel to sell the farm to cover his own gambling debts. Five children, a frazzled mother on the brink of a nervous breakdown, and a horrid brother-in-law drives everyone to distraction.<br /><br />Thus, the WWII version of Nanny 911 arrives, intent on teaching the children five valuable lessons via her own form of entrancing magic. As Nanny McPhee demonstrated in her first film, hilarity abounds, as well as life lessons that benefit the children.<br /><br />Emma Thompson is magical, and her lessons to the children are filled with a patient wisdom we all could practice. My favorite part has always been the slight transformation that begins to overtake this dreadfully plain woman, making her the beauty that Thompson truly is.<br /><br />I have to give this a family film 4 star, for the simple charm and magic that can hold youngsters enraptured and keep adults smiling.e to give this a family film 4 star, for the simple charm and magic that can hold youngsters enraptured and keep adults smiling.
0439023513|1.0|I have looked forward to Mockingjay's release for months....and I can't emphasize how much it disappointed me.  Nothing turned out like I expected, and from start to finish the book was just kind of depressing.  I enjoy reading fiction because it takes me to \\"another\\" world and most of the time leaves me with a happy feeling.  Not so with Mockingjay.      Spoilers.....    First, I was disappointed that Madge was killed off essentially before the book even began.  I had hoped that her character would be developed, etc---and I had hoped for a future Madge/Gale romance.  I thought that was perhaps hinted at when Madge treked through the snow to bring Gale morphling in book 2.  I was also disappointed that Gale's family never really made an appearance.      Second, I was disappointed in the entire Peeta storyline.  I REALLY loved Peeta's character in the first two books and with the hijacking scenerio his character was virtually non-existent.  I had hoped to see a gradual development of a Peeta/Katniss relationship but the book barely focused on that at all---instead it focused on more depressing matters.      Third, I was disappointed with how both Gale and Katniss handled their relationship/friendship at the end regarding Prim's death.  Gale was a major character and just to say he was off in another district with a good job was not enough for me.  I also did not like how Katniss was once again virtually abandoned by her mother.     Fourth, I didn't like the way the rebellion ended.  I didn't think that Snow roaming around his rose garden was realistic for a criminal of his stature.  I also didn't like how Katniss and Haymitch voted yes for a future Hunger Games....and I didn't like how Katniss murdered Coin.  Did I dislike Coin?  Yes, of course.  But did I like the \\"heroine\\" of the novel murdering her?  No.  I would have liked Katniss exposing Coin for who she was instead and bringing her to justice....but that would have required a longer book---which would have been fine with me.  The Twilight Saga's \\"Breaking Dawn\\" was super long and it did fine.  I think Collins would have been better served making Mockingjay longer and filling in more of the gaps that were left in the story.      There are a zillion other things I didn't like about the book---and it may perhaps be at least partially attributed to the fact I have read a few good fanfiction stories that went in an entirely different direction than Collins.  In this book, Collins writing seemed disjunct and at times rambling.  It seemed almost as if she was on a tight deadline and just had to get something on the paper.  I apologize for this overly critical review---I just really was disappointed in this book---from start to finish.  The first third of the book was even to the point of boring to me....and I had figured it would be a page turner like the others were for me.
B0034G4OU4|1.0|I'm partial to this actress, enjoying the numerous movies in which she's appeared (my favorite being Notting Hill).  Unfortunately, I had to shake my head at this film, after forcing myself not to walk out mid-way.<br /><br />Perhaps I should have read the book first, and saved myself the trouble of actually seeing the film.<br /><br />First off, the good points--the photography in the various locales (Bali, Italy, and India) was stunning.  The vibrancy of the photography was brilliant, and to say they were breathtaking would be an understatement.  The story had potential, so I believed, but I was vastly disappointed.  Overall, it drew away from the glamor emitted from the great photography.<br /><br />Roberts played her role with the same skill she has demonstrated in her other films, reaching to envelop the character with an all-encompassing grace.  Her  male co-stars (Billy Crudup and  James Franco) provided perfect foils to her acting. It was the story line that was lacking.<br /><br />Centered around her divorce, I understand that this is  a difficult medium for anyone to reach in their lifetime.  Liz Gilbert's journey from her divorce to her self-realization was just a little too much to handle, filled with (what I interpreted) as self-absorption before she reached self-realization.  My belief has always been \\"When times get tough, aren't you supposed to pull up your pants and tackle life head-on.  Running away never solves anything.\\"  That is precisely what the leading lady did when she encountered trying times.<br /><br />Goodness, wouldn't we all love to go through a trying time in our lives, and manage to jet off to some exotic locale (for a year!)  to get away from it all? Reality is this:  many of us can't afford the escape (financially), nor can we say the hell with everything, and leave it all behind.<br /><br />I hate to pass out a bad review but, if you're looking for a film with depth,  save your money on this one.  (Please remember, this is simply my opinion)<br /><br />Go to the movies and see something entertaining, a film that will make you wish you were off in that magical world portrayed on the screen, and not wallowing in intense and heart wrenching despair.ing entertaining, a film that will make you wish you were off in that magical world portrayed on the screen, and not wallowing in intense and heart wrenching despair.
B000002NJS|5.0|I've never been a Madonna fan- not even close except for a few guilty pleasures in her catalog. When she was doing Material Girl I was jamming the Clash, REM or Violent Femmes. Fast forward many years later and most music lovers have broadened their tastes, just as she has. Over time I certainly had to admit she had broad and diverse talent, even if it never spoke to me personally very much.<br /><br />But then something happened: I heard The Power of Goodbye a regular yoga class I take and when I asked my teacher who it was I did a little double-take when she said Madonna. But then I thought, hey, let's give this one a chance and reviews of the album seemed to point to something very different.<br /><br />Well, as the title suggests, I love this album, and it is one of the few spirit-tinged albums that comes off with some real honesty and doesn't hit you over the head with it. Her voice is like pure honey, but strong and mature. I find myself often going back to it even when I'm working because the tone seems to help me focus. Song after song feels like a warm wash of sound that is both grounding and inspiring. The music stands up well now years after it's release. In fact the trance influenced rhythms and structure is perfect for the quasi Eastern spiritual themes weaves throughout.<br /><br />Stand-outs for me are: The Power of Goodbye, Frozen, Skin, Nothing Really Matters. Although a number of songs may have been with her daughter in mind, most could also be just as easily towards the concept of God/the Beloved/Spirit. That she leaves some room to let the songs speak to you that is personal is another strength.
B002ZG999U|3.0|I'm a big fan of those corny action films with Steven Seagal, Van Damme, and Jackie Chan. Yes, when those moves are on SPIKE TV, I'm the glutton that hogs the remote and refuses to switch the channel, no matter how bad the acting.  The story lines hold my attention, and a house filled with boys over rules any kleenex carrying drama.  I had hoped to find the  same action and adventure in The Expendables.  My expectations were high,  considering all my old favorites were involved in the making of this all-star film.<br /><br />Perhaps it was nostalgia that drew me more than the promised dynamite, gun play, and rolling high kicks.  I remember Sylvester Stallone when he was king of the ring, Dolph Lundgren was the epitome of the perfect He-Man as he fought for the rights of the universe, Stone Cold Steve Austin dominated the WWE, Eric Roberts played the perfect bad guy in that western world that existed between Heaven and Hell, Schwarzenegger was the cyborg that you wanted on your side, Mickey Rourke could spout wisdom that could make a grown man cry, and Willis would risk life and limb to save his soon-to-be ex-wife.<br /><br />This movie offered all-- old-time favorites, accompanied by the new and fresh faces of Jason Statham, Terry Crews, Jet Li, and Randy Couture.<br /><br />Honestly, wait for the movie to come to SPIKE TV for free.  Don't get me wrong...there was plenty of action, dynamite, a story line that had potential,  and blazing weapons.  Statham was stellar, Li was his amazing self, and Couture can take a beating unlike anything I've ever seen.  Though, despite all the action, I felt there was something lacking. Perhaps its the fact  the action was a bit unbelievable.<br /><br />Honestly, there's only so many high kicks and head bangs a person can take once they reach AARP certification.  These darlings of the 1980s and 90s are getting more than a tad up in years.  The movie reminded me more of the guys, sitting around that bonfire in the desert, reminiscing about all those fantastic ass-kickings they used to deal out in their younger days.  Certainly, there's a ton of us out there that wish we had the same moves, looks, and action we had when we were young, but there is a limit.  It's all merely dreams and memories, not something we wish to go out and re-live.  Perhaps I'm being a bit harsh, or I'm being a realist.  Bones do break, high-flying action followed by dynamic explosions is awe-inspiring, but being in your mid-to-late 60s means you wake up with a jar of Icy Hot and arthritis medication when all the glamor shots are done.<br /><br /> I can't entirely knock The Expendables...if it can hold the attention of 9 through 15-year-old boys, it isn't all bad.ass-kickings they used to deal out in their younger days.

B000PDYVVG|2.0|When I picked up Eat, Pray, Love I was not looking for spiritual insight. Elizabeth Gilbert had already won me over with her TED Talks. Regardless of whether I loved or hated it, I still intended to see the movie version because I love Julia Roberts and I believe the locations will be striking on the silver screen. What I'm saying is that I had no preconceived notions about what I stood to gain from reading \\"Eat Pray Love\\" beyond entertainment value. I heard that it was trite. Trite is one of my favorite things. Still though, I found reading this book to be an arduous task from start to finish. I have traveled and lived overseas for several years. I don't feel that Mrs. Gilbert captures the experience in the least. Neither the lowest, most frustrating days of life abroad, nor the most magical experiences of being a foreigner are communicated in \\"Eat Pray Love\\". I could tolerate the self absorbtion or the lack of interest in culture and history if only I could connect with the character's experiences. But I simply could not. Her sister on the other hand, seemed lovely, smart and connected. If she ever wrote a book about her travels, I would buy it instantly. I'm disappointed in the book overall. I would not recommend it to anyone except depressed, unhappily married, big city women with very little travel experience.
0316069884|5.0|We all have to eat, but the way we choose to eat and what we put in our bodies is a very powerful position to be in.<br />Author Safran argues the right and wrong of animal processing and what you as a consumer can do to make intelligent choices to what goes on your plate at every meal, every day. This book was very insightful and as a reader you come out with a much better understanding of what takes place to bringing food to the table rather than an after thought many of us do when we decide to eat. Highly recommended.
B00004CX4X|1.0|I received the DVD in a Rush Hour soundtrack DVD case.  Along with the DVD was a CD call \\"Pump Ya Fist, Hip Hop Insired by the Black Panthers.\\" After I complained, the Seller did offer to give me a $10 discount on my next purchase. I went to their website but it was difficult to find a DVD unless you already had one in mind.  Their DVDs are listed alphabetically.  It would have helped if they'd had them also listed by category.  I never used the discount. Will probably never purchase from this seller again.
B0038Q3UKA|5.0|In an earlier review Asia Khuf asks who this issue is for. It's for me! Although I have admired Radu Lupu, primarily for his recording with Murray Perahia of Schubert's great Fantasy for piano four hands, I have never collected any others of his recordings. I knew he was a noted Schubert interpreter, but I had never heard any of his sonata recordings or the Moments musicaux or Impromptus. Further, I didn't much like most of the Schubert sonatas I'd heard as played or recorded by other performers. But, as this set was available at budget price and as I am insatiably curious about pianists and repertoire, I thought I would give it a try. Well, my goodness what a revelation it has been! I dived right into the Schubert discs and have to say that for the first time in my life I found myself beginning to understand why others so love his sonatas. Lupu's way with these sonatas, particularly the later ones, is mind-boggling for me. For the first time these works began to speak to me in a way that was beguiling. I even found myself blubbering at the beauty of the Adagio of the C Minor Sonata, D958. In sum, I spent the better part of two days listening just to the Schubert pieces and it was a world-changing experience for me. I cannot say why other pianist's interpretations of these works have not spoken to me, but I do note that Lupu's ability to play those seemingly endless movements and keep them fresh and intriguing to the very end is a new experience for me. And how he keeps those slow movements from plodding or falling apart is a mystery. But whatever it is, this man is the Schubert interpreter of a lifetime.<br /><br />Scott Morrison
B000PMFS2I|1.0|I'm not one to take the side of bullies, but if the former uber-agent Mike Ovitz was right about anything, it could have been that the screenwriter Joe Eszterhaz needed to be run out of Hollywood.<br /><br />That's the only conclusion a movie enthusiast can draw after sitting through this stinking pile of poo, for which Eszterhaz wrote the ludicrous, vulgar, and ridiculously meretricious screenplay.<br /><br />There were some talented people involved in this movie.  Paul Verhoeven in particular has made some of my favorite sci-fi films, notably \\"Robocop,\\" \\"Total Recall,\\" and \\"Starship Troopers.\\"  Gina Gershon, Alan Rachins, and Kyle Maclachlan have all done good work as actors.<br /><br />So what in the world were they thinking getting involved with this mess?  I guess they all just needed the money and hoped that \\"Showgirls\\" would soon be forgotten...<br /><br />Well, there's one group I CAN recommend this film to: teen-aged boys, who will be rewarded by the parade of naked breasts on display here for much of the film's running time.  Everyone else should steer far clear...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of a very few books that can hold my attention completely. Even out of the 3 books in the same trilogy, I like this one the best. The story is simple, but the ideas that is flowing thru out the book is always surprising. It is a very much recommended reading!
0375507256|5.0|Exceptional novel, rarely do I feel the author has both enough self-awareness of his craft and respect for his readers -- Mitchell has both and ever so much more to offer.
B0002DB52M|5.0|I have never seen a dramatic performance as powerful as that of Nicole Kidman in this film. She portrays Grace Mulligan, who seeks refuge in Dogville, a very small village (fifteen adults, seven children). Dogville is in a remote mountainous pocket of desperate poverty during the Great Depression of the 1930's. It's accessible by only one mountain road. The one radio in town only plays music. No news. It's like Dogville makes up its own shabby little world.       Grace is running away from gangsters. She is at the mercy of the townspeople, all of whom know that she is hiding from grave danger. So, she depends on the milk of human kindness.      For the most part, Dogville's residents appear to be kind and compassionate toward Grace at first. But that's before they start thinking that Grace just might be the perfect victim...      The film reinforces the Hobbesian notion that many do the right thing only because they fear retribution for behaving poorly. So, how do people treat someone who is totally at their mercy? That is, how do people act once they think that there is no possibility of retribution?      The production of the film is unique. It's set on a bare-bones stage. People act like they are opening and closing doors; there are no actual doors. Walls are just lines on the floor. The most substantial props are cars and a truck used in a few scenes.       Once I got over the unusual staging, I realized that the acting was all that mattered. Kidman's performance is remarkable as Grace comes to learn, the hard way, how cruel people can be. It all builds to a shocking, explosive, conclusion. All of the acting is solid, but, for the most part, the others could just play off of Kidman's work.
0439023513|4.0|I loved the book, I wish it had a little more romance,but I do understand why there wasn't. Katniss was so consumed with loss of war that she had no room for feeling of any other kind. Gayle seemed to be less in tune to her also ( he was consumed by the war in a diffetent way). Peeta on the other hand, when lucid, always loved her.It was a perfect ending. I would have hated the whole book if a bit of happiness didn't happen.
B000F5GNX8|5.0|I cannot believe that it took me 5 years after it's release to see this movie. So, I might be kinda biased because I'm just in LOVE with Robert Downey, Jr., but every one of my friends that I've highly recommended watch this film has absolutely loved it as well. It's got a certain something that sets it apart from the other movies   in the same genre. Val is amazing as always, this time playing homosexual detective/hollywood consultant, Big Gay Perry, and in my opinion, is utterly hilarious.   Two of my favorite actors in one film, incorporating just enough suspense and plenty of humor throughout that will make this a movie you'll wanna watch again and again, if only for the hilarious one liners (there are plenty of them!).   Best watched with a mature audience; there's a lot of adult humor and some nudity. You will not be disappointed!
0790740443|5.0|This movie is a classic example of how brains can beat brawns every time. This movie is an action packed with well thought out battle plans. Great movie for any action fan.

B001GKJ2FC|3.0|I was not as impressed by this movie than I have been on other Angelina Jolie movies.  I might have been happier had I watched it first on Netflix and then not bought it.
B001R60ESE|4.0|I enjoyed this blu ray more than Chris Botti's previous release (which is saying something!) and I highly recommend it. The song choices and the show overall just seems to work better to me. Beautifully filmed and edited, the only thing I don't like is one aspect of the sound. The audience clapping in time is channeled through to the surround speakers as expected, but it is a terrible cheap and tinny sound.... almost like a synthetic clapping sound with the treble turned up high. And it's too loud which tends to hurt the overall mix at times. Actually the soundscape is a bit too conservative / safe / thin / lacking dynamics for my taste..... but perhaps that style of mix better suits such a large stage full of musicians. However on balance, this is an absolutely excellent show with some very odd surprises (Steve Tyler??) that somehow just work really well. Great stuff indeed.
B002ZG9788|3.0|The special effects were really good but the story was not there.  If I had not known the story I would have been left wondering.  I liked the witches and Medusa creatures but was left cold by Zeus.  The old picture with Harry Hamlin was short on special effects but the story was great and I had hoped this movie would have the same great story with better visual effects.  Like I said the visuals were great but the story sucked.  I did like Iol getting Perseus though.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Elf is an excellent movie for people of all ages. It has some great throwbacks and references to the Christmas classics we all grew up loving... Rudolf, Frosty, etc. The one star reviews suggest the movie is stupid, I say it's playful. Although this is not the Ferrell you may know from Zoolander, Old School, etc., he totally delivers and lets his fun and sweet side shine. Elf has everything that one wants in a Christmas classic - heartwarming story, lovable characters, little bit of singing to bring on the spirit, snow, and (duh!) SANTA! Not since The Santa Clause (1994) has Hollywood delivered such an automatic holiday classic. The best thing about this movie is that it's funny enough to watch with your lover and/or friends (and a few drinks) or cuddled up on a winter night with your kids. Also, for film buffies out there, the art direction is wonderful and presents very clear themes (plus keep your eye out for a Peter Billingsly uncredited cameo!). All over this movie is just worth it!

0375507256|5.0|One hundred years from now, students will be taking courses on David Mitchell in colleges around the country- I am confident in saying that his work will withstand the test of time. Cloud Atlas is an intricately created work that exemplifies what literature should be.<br /><br />Loved:<br />- The five sections in this novel are each given the same amount of care and attention, and the way they are woven together demands that the reader pay attention. Generally when reading segmented books I tend to gravitate towards some than others- I can honestly say that each of the stories completely captivated me.<br />- Mitchell's prose, as always, embodies this unique quality in which it is both modern and aged with wisdom. His descriptions are never boring, his dialogue is flawless, and his research is carefully done.<br />- There's something for everyone in this novel; history, the future, scandal, mystery, and ethics.<br />- While reading it's obvious that Mitchell loves what he does; he's attached to the characters and story and refuses to cut corners in any way. I saw him at a reading a few months ago, and his appreciation for the craft and his readers is admirable and refreshing.<br /><br />Not For Everyone<br />- This is a long, dense book that is definitely not for everyone. It makes you think about the text itself and about life in general- those that want a quick read should look elsewhere.
B002ZG983M|1.0|This movie was a complete waste of time. I only managed to sit through it because I was watching it with someone else. The story was bad, the acting dreadful, and the plot plodding.<br /><br />I usually don't bother to write bad movie reviews as there are so many being produced these days but I didn't want anyone else to suffer through this drivel.<br /><br />I'm just glad that I was able to access the net while watching it so that i could divert my attention for a while.
B003L20IDS|5.0|Well, seeing as how most of my friends are nerdy we all went out to see Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. The initial premise (as mentioned repeatedly in the trailers) is that Scott falls for a girl (Ramona) who has had an unhappy string of relationships with a bunch of nutcases and Scott has to defeat all of them. Just going off of the trailer, I was expecting a pretty straightforwards romp with hyperactive graphics everywhere. What I got was something much better.    First of all the story is not as simple as first impression would indicate. Scott is also quite the heartbreaker in the film and his experience mirrors Ramona's a lot. I would even go so far to say that he doesn't so much as defeat the evil exes as much as come to terms with how he broke up with various girls and how his previous ugly break up with Envy has really slammed him. At least, that's what I got with the \\"fight\\" with the Evil Twin Scott. All the other characters are just as screwed up and just as awkwardly nerdy in their own way. Anyway there is a rather cute little story about respecting yourself and other people underneath all of the flash and bang.    The flash and bang isn't all that bad either. This features probably the most fun I've seen with \\"Bam!\\" \\"Pow!\\" and \\"Thud!\\" since I was ten and was still watching Batman with Adam West. It's rather like watching a live action comic, because the sound inserts are used where one would expect to find them in a comic, including the ringing phones and headdesking. Each of the fights with the evil exes are different and entertaining in completely different ways. I loved the bass battle between Scott and ex number 3, if only because I was the only one in the theater who realized what they were playing (Final Fantasy fight music) and thoroughly amused by it.    In general, I would call the visuals and the narrative style distinctly and awesomely campy. It makes utterly no pretense of being anything else and gives it a giant bear hug topped off with a big sloppy kiss instead. Anyone who has ever played and liked a video game of any kind will probably find some in-joke to chuckle at. The acting and camera work is completely tongue in cheek and it pulls it together.    I wouldn't look at this film as the next Oscar winner, but the story is better than I thought, the visuals serve the narrative, the soundtrack rocks the house and the jokes are funny. There's not much more I could ask for out of this film. I loved it, thought it awesome and will probably see it again given the opportunity.
B0000TLA9G|4.0|This Greatest Hits CD was good.  THe first 7 songs were fantastic, then the next couple were so-so.  That's understandable as every song can't be great.  What disappointed me was there were a few songs on this greatest hits CD that weren't Gun's & Roses originals.  Live and Let Die...Beatles.  Symapthy for the Devil...Stones.  I didn't udnerstand why these would be on a Greatest Hits CD for Guns and Roses.  Yes, they sang the songs, but I would prefer to hear their songs, not a remake of another group.

B000286S8S|4.0|I've read alot of complaining about the sequence of the songs and I see the point but it has it's pros as well. You get a better comparaison of Roth and Hagar this way. To be honest if they had broken them up in to Disc one Roth and Disc two Hagar I would have not played the Hagar stuff much at all.  This way I was sort of forced to listen and now have a genuine appreciation for the man as a singer.  I've always prefered David Lee Roth but I can at least see both eras respetfully now where as I use to just ignore most Hagar songs on the radio.  This album has made be want to buy more of both eras of Van Halen now.

The author, Zafon's writing is spectacular as he captures you and takes you away to 1950's Barcelona, Spain. He fleshes out his characters so well that you fall in love with them.  The love story or stories are surreal and mystical. This book feels like fairy tale with historical fiction and suspense built in.  I loved it! This is one of my all time favorite reads!!

B002UXRH10|4.0|Rihanna is definitely a lightning rod type of singer - people either love her or hate her.  I think her voice is interesting, sure she's not a powerhouse vocalist but her writers & producers craft music around her ability along with her attitude (or \\"swagger\\") and most times that works for her.<br /><br />Like most people I was horrified by her beating and hoped that she could move past it; not to produce music but just to find some inner peace & balance in her life.  I think the project is an exorcism of the past & both she and the writers collaborated well to present a collection of really good tracks that gave listeners a glimpse into where her head was at during this difficult year.<br /><br />My faves: MAD HOUSE is a really good if eerie opener.  It tells listeners we are in store for something scary and not to proceed if we can't handle it.<br /><br />WAIT YOUR TURN - is a synthy kind of dark sounding track. Rihanna sounds great as her accent is more pronounced on this mash up of pop/reggae<br /><br />HARD - I really like this track, it's got a great beat and sassy lyrics featuring an assist from rapper, Jeezy (who I was unfamiliar with prior to hearing him on this track)<br /><br />RUSSIAN ROULETTE - risky choice for a lead single but I really love this song.  I fully understood the song as a metaphor for falling in love BUT the video was a little too literal & disturbing to watch<br /><br />RUDE BOY - complete guilty pleasure song, fun beat with somewhat naughty lyrics<br /><br />STUPID IN LOVE - another ballad where Rihanna sounds really good; this track seems to touch on her relationship with Chris Brown and reveals how she feels about the situation<br /><br />ROCKSTAR 101 - another fun pop song with a rock edge<br /><br />I think TE AMO, FIREBOMB, COLD CASE LOVE & PHOTOGRAPHS are just \\"ok\\".  I like the musical arrangement of TE AMO; the lyrics of FIREBOMB but not the arrangement; CCL is too long and gets maudlin at about the halfway point until the song picks up tempo near the end and while I love her singing & the lyrics of PHOTOGRAPHS, Will.I.Am kind of ruins this song for me.<br /><br />Finally I really hate everything about G4L - I do not buy Rihanna as this hard gangster girl and as many times as I've tried to listen to this track, I just don't like it.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed listening to most of this collection but wasn't too surprised to hear that her label is rushing another album out possibly for release at the end of this year. I think that this is a really cohesive album that didn't feature the \\"fun\\" or catchy tracks that people have come to expect from Rihanna but does feature a few songs that allowed her to express herself after a harrowing situation.of PHOTOGRAPHS, Will.I.Am kind of ruins this song for me.

0439023491|5.0|\\"A visit from President Snow. Districts on the verge of uprisings. A direct death threat to Gale, with others to follow. Everyone I love doomed. And who knows who else will pay for my acions? Unless I turn things around on this tour. Quiet the discontent and put the president's mind at rest. And how? By proving to the country beyond any shadow of a doubt that I love Peeta Mellark.\\" -- From Catching Fire<br /><br />In the second installment of the Hunger Games trilogy, Katniss, Peeta, Haymitch and the stylists are headed around the country of Panem on the Victory Tour. After 75 years of the brutal, twisted Hunger Games pitting children ages 12-18 against one another, this particular Game detailed in the book Hunger Games was different: there are TWO victors instead of one.<br /><br />Usually, only one victor can win the Hunger Games. But midway through the last one, the Game Makers decide to do something unprecedented: they announce that TWO can win this time. Relieved that she won't have to face attempting to kill her male counterpart from District 12 (who has professed his love for her), Katniss Everdeen yells out Peeta's name in relief.<br /><br />They team up. They win. But at the last moment, the twisted Game Keepers announce that the \\"two can win\\" rule has been revoked. They now have to fight to the death. Katniss remembers the poisonous berries from earlier in the Games and hands them to Peeta. On the count of three, she says. After they pop the deadly fruit in their mouths, a horn blares and a hurried announcement broadcasts: Katniss and Peeta have BOTH won the Hunger Games!<br /><br />But what Katniss doesn't realize is that her action, born of desperation, is seen as an act of defiance against the Capitol's brutality. Her decisions sets off a spark that blazes across the Districts--causing unrest and rebellion.<br /><br />In the second book of the Trilogy, Catching Fire, President Snow visits Katniss right before the Victory Tour, telling her that if she doesn't convince the cameras--and the citizens of each district--that her actions were born of love for Peeta and not a political act, everyone she loves will pay.<br /><br />However, what happens on the Victory Tour--what she witnesses and what her presence provokes among the citizens--is far more out of her control than she realizes.<br /><br />She has become the Mockingjay. The symbol of the revolution. The last revolution that happened 75 years ago resulted in the nuclear devastation of District 13. What will happen THIS time when cruel President Snow feels like he's losing control by the minute?<br /><br />As arresting as book one, The Hunger Games, Catching Fire will leave you breathless and hungering for more.

B0036EH3WK|5.0|I received my Lost gift set yesterday.  Its a very lovely gift from the creators of Lost.  As you've heard, it comes with a Senet board and game pieces, ankh that contains hints on how to get to an easter egg on the bonus disc, a diary page from the black rock and the black light (which helps you see the hatch map on the bottom of the box as well as reveal the hints to find the extra disc).  The replica of the temple is very sturdy...and you can actually turn the lid upside-down so that the map is on top if thats your preference.    What a lot of reviews fail to mention is that it's loaded with a heaping dose of nostalgia.      The box that the set comes wrapped in is actually a memorial of all the characters that appeared on the show.  The episode guide has some very lovely illustrations in it, depicting what I would consider the most memorable scenes of the show.  The sleeves that the discs come in also have some of the same type of artwork.  I actually got a lump in my throat as I was flipping through these things remembering the first time we watched those scenes...remembering the people I'd discuss the episodes with and realizing we wont have any of that this year except for the mass re-watch that many of us will be participating in.    Then there are the special features.  Swan Song shows everyone in Michael Giacchino's studio watching them record the soundtrack for the finale.  Carlton Cuse was literally fighting back tears and you could tell this was a very sad moment for everyone in the room.  It's at this point, a true Lost fan will probably be reaching for the kleenex as well.      The bonus disc which is hidden in the set, has a feature called Letting Go which is basically several cast members revisiting locations and talking about what it's going to be like for this family of actors to be disbanding after working together for six years.  It's a very emotional feature and makes me realize just how long six years really is...but how quickly it all went by.      I think that if you enjoy this sort of nostalgia...You really should pick up this set.
0307592839|4.0|I seem to have read a fairly large number of books recently that are comprised of inter-locking stories.  There was \\"Olive Kitteridge,\\" and \\"Other Rooms, Other Wonders,\\" and also the quirkily original \\"The Imperfectionists.\\"  Enter Jennifer Egan's \\"A Visit from the Goon Squad,\\" a very clever book that turns those other books on their heads.  She not only creates a series of interconnected stories, weaving them back and forth in time, but includes, I believe for the first time, a chapter presented in PowerPoint mode.  She's good enough that none of it seems contrived or gimmicky.  It all works beautifully.    The stories are centered on the lives of Bennie Salazar, an aging former punk rocker and record producer and his one-time assistant Sasha and span the years 1979 through about 20 years into the future.  This is much too complicated a plot to try to summarize and it is a book that I will try to reread in the next six months because I think that is how the stories will gel for me.  A very interesting yet very challenging read, there were times when I couldn't pin down the time frame and then Egan would throw out the words that would immediately solidify when the story was taking place without giving the actual date.  She draws connections and parallels between her characters and the dying music industry because this is, above all, a book about rock and roll.  Patterned after albums which have an A and B side she is able to draw comparisons to her struggling characters lives: an overweight, down on his luck rocker; a young girl with a stealing propensity; a has been publicist who tries to resurrect her career on the back of a Central American dictator and a washed-up actress; a young journalist who loses control of his story and himself as he tries to rape the young actress he's interviewing; and along the way the story seamlessly turns in on itself and makes for a fascinating mosaic.    The closing chapter, which takes place in the future, reveals how society mayhave evolved about twenty years from now and the author chooses her words carefully:  \\"Rebecca was an academic star.  Her new book was on the phenomenon of word casings, a term she'd invented for words that no longer had meaning outside quotation marks.  English was full of these empty words---\\"friend\\" and \\"real\\" and \\"story\\" and \\"change\\"---words that had been shucked of their meanings and reduced to husks.  Some, like \\"identity,\\" \\"search,\\" and \\"cloud,\\" had clearly been drained of life by their Web usage.  With others, the reasons were more complex; how had \\"American\\" become an ironic term?  How had \\"democracy\\" come to be used in an arch, mocking way?\\"  (Page262)    Smooth, polished writing carries you along and Egan's ability to draw deep, complex characters and to connect to the reader with great storytelling makes each story compelling and able to stand on its own.  But it is as you start to make the connections that you find yourself smiling at the ingenuity of the narrative.  Highly recommended for the reader willing to be patient for the big reward.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|Tacky, corny, and very silly. But so much fun! And the music? Loved it. No they're not all singers but they're great. The scenary is spectacular, the music contagious, and the theme...... This is a fell good movie that is very close to home for those of free spirits of the 60's.
0375507256|5.0|David Mitchell has been called a genius by more learned individuals than me.  This novel is certainly proof of that.  It is filled with symbolism, stories nested within each other, major and minor common themes among the stories, and it goes to enormous strides to help to characterize the cruelty of man to his fellow man over hundreds of years from the distant past into the far future.  He even gets in ridicule of the rampant consumerism that has engulfed our world.  The fact that he is able to do this while telling a rip-snorting tale only adds to the perception of his genius.        The book begins with the story of Adam Ewing, who in 1849 is traveling in the South Pacific and recording a journal of his voyage.  His journal ends abruptly (in the middle of a sentence!) and the next story begins which takes place in Belgium in 1931.  At one point in this story, the author mentions Adam Ewing's journal, a part of which has been located on the book shelves of the estate in Belgium where the story is set.  This story continues until it, also, ends abruptly.  And so it goes.  Each of six stories, all set in different times and places, with entirely unique characters, is connected somehow to the story that precedes it.  One of the stories is told from beginning to end, uninterrupted.  But each remaining story is concluded in a later chapter in the book.  This provides for an absolutely fascinating read.    The amazing thing for me was Mitchell's uncanny ability to provide a unique voice for each story.  With dialects to match the period in history and the location on earth, and although the plots, theme, voice and setting vary greatly, he is able to weave them together and move the reader along through a mesmerizing narrative.  Mitchell's signature humor shines in \\"The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish\\":    \\"I asked for a loan of eighty thousand pounds.  He began with a thoughtful, 'Right.....' I lowered my ceiling to sixty.  Elliot pointed out that my performance linked credit stream still had a twelve month flow horizon before resizing could be feasibly optioned.  Oh, I miss the days when they'd laugh like a hyena, tell you to go to hell and hang up.\\"  (Page 156)    With Mitchell's heavier themes, though, he doesn't mince words.   Dr. Henry Goose reveals his Two Laws of Survival in 1849:    \\"It runs thus, `The weak are meat the strong do eat.'  It upsets me that a dedicated healer & gentle Christian can succumb to such cynicism.  I asked to hear Goose's Second law of Survival.  Henry grinned in the dark and cleared his throat.  `The Second Law of Survival states that there is no second law.  Eat or be eaten.  That's it.\\"  (Page 489-490)    I can't begin how say how much I enjoyed this novel.  Mitchell was brilliant and \\"Cloud Atlas\\" is not to be missed.  It will make you think....a lot.  That thinking will continue after the book is completed and probably for some time to come.  Very highly recommended.
B00102F5WK|3.0|Rendition is a good movie but it's really hard to watch.  The first time through it's also hard to follow, but after two viewings you get it.  The cast is good and the ending is satisfying.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Since I have an English ancestry of family members who came from northern England (Manchester) and were business tradesmen as well, I found this DVD series absolutely fascinating.  I don't think I'll ever forget Margaret Hale's words:<br /><br />\\"I wish I could tell you how lonely I am. How cold and harsh it is here. Everywhere there is conflict and unkindness. I think God has forsaken this place. I believe I have seen hell and it's white, it's snow-white.\\"<br /><br />It was an absolutely wonderful series.  Richard Armitage was broodingly dreamy! Daniela Denby-Ash was a perfect fit for Margaret.  The pair made a great iron-upon-iron relationship, that finally melted together in perfect harmony.  The heartache of the poor, the mixture of class, the struggles of life in a time we often wish we could be part of, was done very well.<br /><br />Needless to say, I loved the series.  The ending was heartwarming, and the final relenting kiss of Margaret's lips upon the hand of the man she loved was priceless indeed.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series.  The book is just as good too!
B003Y3ZTGA|2.0|I listened to this album. I tried understanding the whole concept.  Maybe this could be an album for the prostitutes of America.   If you like albums that actually have thought and actually have good lyrics.  Don't buy this.  The production is horrible, it sounds like amateurs getting a copy of FL Studio(Music Production Software)  There is only one catchy song, 'E.T.' Though I  must add, it's not Katy Perry that makes it good. It's the music.  In a quick summary, this album is nothing but sex oriented. This is not a teenage dream, this is a prostitutes dream.
B001C4AFOY|4.0|I've always enjoyed historical movies, and this one I found quite interesting.  We've all seen Mrs. Brown, Queen Victoria's later years, but learning about her younger life before she took the throne was even more interesting.  Pawns in a chess game - that no doubt was the life of many young royals who had to learn how to play the game well and to win.  Victoria's was no different, but from the movie's view she seemed to have enough spunk to rise above her young inexperience and become a queen for all ages.  Her love of Albert was touching, though you have to wonder what it was like for a man to play a subservient role to his wife, the Queen, which was touched on in the movie.  It seems though their marriage overcame those obstacles and was a good balance of husband and wife that resulted in many children.<br /><br />Of course, I never really know how much of movies such as these are pure Hollywood and how much reality is sprinkled throughout.  Nevertheless, I found the movie entertaining and interesting.  It was well acted, the lavish life of the royals, the period costumes, the coronation in all it's pomp was fascinating.  My only complaint was the ending of the movie.  It seemed rushed and all too quick.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|When I saw, \\"from the makers of the Inconvenient Truth\\", on the case, I thought, \\"I'll never watch that\\". Global warming (the man-made kind) is complete BS in my mind, and unless we resume testing atmospheric testing of h-bombs, I am very unlikely to change.     I say that only to illustrate the apparent inconsistency in giving this documentary 5 stars.     Film-wise, the film is very well done. The real-life characters were well chosen and seemed to be good down-to-earth Midwestern folks. That lent a lot of credibility IMO. Politically (a reason I do not watch similarly themed documentaries) I thought it more balanced than most. True, Bush 43's mug was mentioned as well as some in his administration, but Clinton was mentioned too.     It wasn't all-corporations-are-evil, all-the-time either. I liked the balance of one farmer who supposedly does it \\"the right way\\". Here, we could see the slaughtering of chickens, and to some this may appear as bad as the mass-production style of killing, but leaving the distinction up to the viewer was a good choice. I also liked the organic company who does business with Walmart. The CEO's sense of win-win, that is, making a profit while still adhering to the mission of no pesticides, fertilizer, etc., was a good choice too for the film.    The food system is so out-of-sight and out-of-mind in our lives that only the staunch nutritionists I know realize any of the things mentioned in the film. Consequently, I believe most of it is definitely true. One can certainly argue that it is impossible to feed 6 billion people without assembly-line techniques being employed. That is process-oriented change stuff though. When they start altering natural evolution at my expense, that is where I walk over to the \\"enough already\\" side.    The one thing this documentary does for me is confirm a belief I already hold: The United States government is nothing but a huge multi-trillion dollar whorehouse. Corporations pay the pimps (Lobbyists) who buythe whores (Congressmen, Senators, and the White House) who in turn forces their slaves (The American People) to bend over and take it.    This film achieved its objective I think as I will not be able to look at another food product again without reading the label and *this time*, researching what those unpronounceable ingredients are and how they affect my body. I see much more kale in my future now.
B000063DHL|5.0|this is the first maiden album i heard. caught somewhere in time is a great fast moving opener w one of my fav solos. wasted years is a little more melodic, classic maiden sound. sea of madness and heaven can wait are good but not great. not a bad song on the album. stranger in a strange land starts off w a nice rumbling bass line by harris, one of the best bass players in the world. then goes into a nice little riff. great song. the band uses guitar synth on this album for the first time. it worked well. buy this album, it's worth all 60 however minutes.
B001GCUER0|5.0|This is a must see series.  I can't believe I missed it when it was originally shown, but in a way I'm glad because now I own my own set of dvds.  This is definitely a TV show I will go back and watch more than once.  It is beautifully done.  The complexity of the characters and their relationships, the camera work, the surprises that each episode holds makes this well worth purchasing!  Do it!

0679809015|4.0|This is a great little lift-the-flap book.  The book is small (about 3.75\\" high and wide), but I had no issues with reading the font size like one reviewer mentioned.  Because of its small size, it was perfect for stuffing into our bag for a long flight or in the diaper bag.  The text centers around the different sounds animals make; it simply goes \\"Who says ___\\", and then you lift the flap to find the answer.  So, I feel like it offers the child a chance to practice fine motor skills in locating and lifting the flap as well as learning what sound each animal makes.  There are also a lot of objects on each page to point out to a child or ask your child where specific items are.  The artwork is a little old fashioned, but very cute, and remind me of books that I read as a child.
B002ZG977Y|5.0|First of all, reading all the picky reviews all I want to add that (make a better one before you whine this down) I don't know how \\"it butchered down\\" the greek mythology, but it sure made me want to check it out.<br />It is awesome cinematography, beautiful job, and very inspiring especially for people interested in the reality of pre-flood cultures and spiritual realms. I can hardly wait for the sequence.
159102594X|5.0|This is definately one of the best books I've ever read. I hesitate to say this because it might ruin the enjoyment of finding out how good this book actually is, but you MUST read it, so it must be said.    I love knowing the characters I read about and I can't wait to see what happens to these ones in the next book. I love fantasy that doesn't revolve around dragons elves and dwarves, something different. I love the imagination of books directed at younger readers because they're more creative. This one is definately NOT for younger readers. The characters are awesomely violent.    Here's the authors I like so you can determine if you have similiar tastes (Top to bottom the best to almost best):    Orson Scott Card (Abercrombie is most similiar to Card, but the others are what I like too)  Garth Nix  Phillip Pullman  Jonathan Stroud  Susan Cooper (only the dark is rising)  L'engle  Even Charlaine Harris for a quick read
B002ZG97RY|3.0|Another of Jocko's Short But Sweet Reviews:    This thriller gave some good insight on the workings of the American government (CIA, Military, Government) but I was really expecting a summer popcorn movie.    Good beginning, only to falter 1/2 hour into it.....    Was hoping for a Jason Bourne Goes-to-War flick, but instead got a Jason Boring.....yawn.    Show me the WMDs!  At least make some up!  Oh, I guess they did.... \\"wink\\"
1400077915|5.0|Runaway was the first collection of short stories by Alice Munro that I've read. The stories are extremely well-written and penetratingly perceptive.     Munro is adept at creating very deep psychological portraits of her characters with a remarkable economy of words. What most impressed me is her ability to convey profound empathy for each character's actions; this was especially striking when a character was self-destructive or behaved negatively toward another character. Munro has an uncanny ability to empathize with people's weaknesses and the motivation behind harmful behavior. She is then able to deftly translate this empathy for human frailty into astoundingly realistic character portrayals.    In each story, there are aspects that are left unresolved and it is up to the reader to interpret or imagine what happened or why. I found the unresolved aspects unsettling, even disturbing at times.    My only displeasure in reading Runaway was that I found all the stories quite sad and troubling. Even that, however, is a compliment to Munro's ability to write stories that get under the reader's skin, like an unscratchable itch. The unresolved issues linger, the sadness lingers.
B00009V7P8|4.0|I first heard Damien Rice's Delicate as the background music in some shop. I memorized the words (nobody could tell me who the singer was) and I googled the lyrics when home. In less than an hour, I ordered all his CDs.   Yes, you might say Damien is (sometimes) too much. His melancholy; his pace; his pain; his bitterness. But you can't help keep wanting the embrace of his art. And his voice (with the occasional help of Lisa Hannigan, a hit of her own) puts you in such distant places...  For wandering alone in some pasture of your mind, this is a great vehicle. I truly recommend it.

This is simplistic BS and if you like Fox News you will love it.  It won't make you think.  It will affirm your simplistic, willfully ignorant thinking.  You are the Emperor and this book will be your new clothes. They talk about the results of stuides without mentioning the hypotheis.  It never looks at the larger greedy forces at work that work overtime to make sure people don't change and profit form it richly.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|I'm a big fan of Disney Pixar films, but I put off seeing Wall-E until recently.  I was pleasantly surprised!  I was not sure how or if a movie without dialogue would work, but it did.  Pixar did a fabulous job of capturing the emotion of both robots so well.  Once there is some conversation among the main characters, the tone of voice conveys the message loud and clear.  I did not expect to love this movie like I do.  The characters are dear, the story has a little bit of everything - action, romance and comedy.  I am so glad to own a copy of Wall-E. If you've waited to see this movie, it's time.

A great book, powerful and inspiring.  Read it!

I remember being amazed at the animation when Belle and the Beast are dancing.  The reflection effect from the marble floor was stunning.

0439023513|2.0|It's amusing to read some of the reviews and to see the debate focused on whether Mockingjay is great literature and on Katniss Everdeen's strange character regression:  i.e., is it consistent with Katniss' personality to have her be so manipulated here? The critics are missing the basic fact that the book isn't literature, it's propaganda for a particular form of paranoid pacifist isolationism, and Katniss' manipulation is the core of the author's political message to teens. The first two books established beyond peradventure that the Capitol and its president are truly evil - they starve their subject populations, turn human beings into animal-like monsters, regularly force children to kill one another as spectacle for pure sport. We expect Mockingjay to deal with the question of how this evil regime is to be replaced in an ethical way. The author's answer is that it can't, and that the \\"collateral consequences\\" of any rebel fight are so large as to call into question the morality of the entire enterprise. Moreover, says the author, the leader of any rebellion is going to be tainted by the quest for power and ultimately will be equally or more deserving of death than the regime she is fighting. Both sides will use scenes that evoke emotion in the mass media to manipulate you into adhering to their position and all such scenes will be equally false, regardless of what side is responsible. Sorting out truth from falsehood in this situation is almost impossible, according to the author. Your only recourse is to refuse to participate and to retreat into isolation with your family. Of course, as the 20th century showed us beyond any doubt, the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing. The author, a writer for television, is giving her own industry too much credit and her audience too little. We are not all idiots, thank you very much. Teens generally see through these books to the buried fallacious arguments that the authors are tryingto imprint on their brains; my teen read a hundred pages of this book and threw it down in disgust.
B00005221M|4.0|I have the silent version of this movie & it is good so I wanted to see the newer one. Even tho it is the same story it is so different. The silent one wasn't as bloody. But this one was good also.
1441850953|5.0|There is alot of egytian history and on some levels it can be either boring or confusing.  This book is a great way to introduce the different gods and how they relate to each other.  Along with the history lesson, you're entertained by a wonderful story.

It's actually very interesting if you have children.  Most parents don't read to their kids anymore, but if they were, I'd totally read this to them.  It's kind of...childish, like meant for youngsters but I still loved it!

Your edition was the same size as the hardbound, just a little lighter. Did not get much read due to size, and then at the airport on my return, noticed the 'standard' paperback was available. Perhaps you could add a size reference on your site.
B000SXQEGS|5.0|I purchased the debut black sabbath album and it showed up in a very timely manner. Record was good and broken in for me. Has the hit songs \\"black sabbath\\" and \\"NIB\\".

The whole grocery bag bit wasn't even enough to lose a star.
B002BWP4A6|2.0|This has all the makings of a \\"critically acclaimed\\" movie.  It's shot in black and white, has a slow (boring) tempo, portrays Germans as degenerates, has a vague indeterminate ending, and is overall depressing.  Obviously, the theme of the movie is that the rise of the Germans as aggressors in the world wars was because the Christian German people are a bunch of cruel, lowlife degenerates.  This is racist and patently untrue.  The Germans became aggressors because their leaders filled the heads of their people with lies, told them that they were in danger from an attack, and dissent was unpatriotic (sound familiar?).  Do yourself a favor and find something else to do with those 144 minutes!
B002PQ7JME|5.0|Mazzy star \\"she hangs brightly\\" was a good buy for a vinyl record because they incorporated a lot of the late 80's shoe gaze elements with some \\"post jim morrison\\" surreal poetry styles.

Has the songs \\"halah\\" and \\"ghost highway\\". \\"She hangs brightly\\" is mazzy star's debut album.
B002ZG994U|5.0|Given that Hollywood has taken to raping my fondest childhood memories, my favorite TV shows and movies, I was definitely hesitant when I heard of an A-Team remake.  After finally deciding to give it a chance, I felt like a fool in search of pity for being so ignorant.  Simply put, it's AWESOME.<br /><br />Liam Neeson is an impeccable replacement for George Peppard (slight edge to Peppard) as Hannibal Smith, with the same charismatic leadership ability and unwaivering confidence that a plan will come together.  Bradley Cooper is an improvement over Dirk Benedict, creating a Face that is not just good with the ladies, but also capable of carrying an action movie.  The reincarnation of B.A. Baracus is undoubtedly better, as Quinton \\"Rampage\\" Jackson provides more size, strength, and, dare I say it, acting ability than Mr. T.  Obviously, Jackson loses the gold chain contest.  Last but not least is Murdock, played by Sharlto Copley.  There is no doubt whatsoever that he dominates time on screen, and Dwight Schulz, who has all but become an afterthought.  The amazing part about all this is not only are the actors/characters adequate replacements of the originals, but their storylines also get expanded upon and further explained.  The one major flaw to this film is Jessica Biel's character.  As a Captain who gets demoted to Lieutenant, no matter what agency or military she's in, her character is given far too much leeway and power; it's a flaw that a former member of the military can't possibly overlook without it lessening the movie's plot somewhat.<br /><br />After the foursome is introduced, flash-forward eight years to when they become engaged in a convoluted scheme battling the CIA, a Blackwater facsimile, and mysterious foreigners over some $100 U.S. currency engraving plates, the theft for which the A-Team has been framed.  From there it is nothing but explosions, guns, chases, airplanes, tanks, fights, and everything you expect in an action movie.  The camera work is overall above average, but there is a bit of shaky-cam during some of the action scenes.<br /><br />Highly recommended for a great, reminiscent time.<br /><br />Jason Elinove average, but there is a bit of shaky-cam during some of the action scenes.

B001BNFR6W|2.0|I bought this disc set for my wife.  And although the discs appeared to be in good condition, they failed to work properly on any of the DVD players (pleural) I own.  They repeatedly cut out, stalled, and had poor image quality. My wife was very disappointed.

Disc One contains the new 2010 remix, Disc Two contains the original mix and the demo version, Disc Three contains the 5.1 Surround Mix of the 2010 remix.

I bought this set (and the Ommadawn release) to get the 5.1 Surround Mix and it is astonishing. Oldfield certainly knows how to get the best out of an expanded sound field.

0439023513|1.0|...Spoiler Alert...     OK, here's why I was upset with the book. The entire book was based upon a showdown between Snow and Katniss. The first 300 pages are all about hyping up this meeting. Sure, a few cool things happen along the way, but it was all pretty much just \\"busy text\\" to occupy us while we get to the main plot of the book, and...  the series as a whole. We now find Katniss in the courtyard of Snow's frigging mansion, about the break in and take him out as we've all been anticipating.... and then BAM, some random bomb goes off to end the chapter. The next chapter starts with her waking up in a hospital bed, having been out of it for a few days or weeks (I can't quite remember... I thought that this part of the book was some weird vision she was having because there was NO WAY that I thought it was actually part of the plot).  Not only do we not get to witness the bit showdown, but we never get to even reach the climax of the book. Just when we were about to get there, Katniss gets knocked out and then all of the excitement is explained to her (us) after the fact. It was an extremely lazy way to finish the book/series and while it wouldn't be fair to say that it ruined the entire series for me, I'm definitely extremely turned off to Suzanne Collins and will never think about ready one of her books again.

0143039881|4.0|I understand the controversies this book must have caused to the sensitivity of the sufferings of the Jews, but I can't help but being amazed by the courage of the author and her indefatigable power of analytical intellect.  My understanding is that no matter how sensitive the issue was, the author had to bring out what could be one of the most unfavorable aspects of the trial on this individual, which is the political manipulation by the Ben Gurion government used to justify the state of Israel. Perhaps by vilifying and punishing one individual, the world may lose the perspectives of the moral collapse of the entire European society, and the implication that no one is exempt from the potential of evil, either by active participation or passive condonation/compromise, or simple indifference.  She is sharp in her criticism of discrepancies and hypocrisies in the laws, trials, and media coverage.  Although she does not present any solutions or potential alternatives, her perspectives are broad, and very very insightful, particularly in retropect of the last 50 years since the report--Genocides in Africa, oppression of women in Muslim countries and what has been going on in Israel occupied Palestine, and lack of united mechanism to handle these crimes in the international politics.
B000002TQV|5.0|This album was perfect for its time, and to me still represents some of the best music of the 1990's.  It's also a great album for people like me who are challenged by Radiohead.  Do I really like this band?  Are they annoyingly pretentious?  Genius?  All of the above?<br /><br />All doubts aside for this album.  It's simply perfect.
0743298039|4.0|Margaret Lea is an introverted and unworldly bookworm who is stunned to receive a letter from Vida Winters, the most famous, beloved, and best-selling author in Britain. In her correspondence, Miss Winter recounts her long-ago experience with a journalist who once cut through the authoress' usual imaginative storytelling and asked instead for the truth. Shocked by this, Miss Winter has never forgotten his request, and now she claims she's ready to share her life story with a biographer.<br /><br />For reasons beyond Margaret's comprehension, the world-renowned authoress has chosen *her*. It is not an invitation that one can decline. Furthermore, Margaret has her own family secrets that she wants to escape from, and so she travels to Miss Winter's secluded house in order to hear and transcribe the old woman's story...<br /><br />What follows is a Gothic tale of an extremely troubled family (and that's putting it mildly), that includes obsession, abuse, incest, betrayal, elopement, bereavement, and two little girls - twins - whose relationship make up the crux of the book. Adeline and Emmeline are identical in practically every way, allowed to run wild through the countryside and wreck havoc both in the house and out of it. But there's something more troubling about these two, particularly Adeline, whose vicious games have a darkness to them that frightens those who come across her. The housekeeper and the gardener are the only staff that remains on the grounds, joined late in the game by a governess who tries to impose some semblance of order upon the household - with mixed results.<br /><br />As the story goes on, Margaret becomes aware of her storyteller's failing health, and of the growing sense of an eerie presence in the house - or perhaps it's only vague memories of Margaret's own past intruding on the present. The answer lies in the thirteenth tale, the final story that Miss Winter is withholding until the gradual unfolding of her life story is complete.<br /><br />Told in first-person narrative, but alternating between Margaret's point-of-view and the chapters that cover Vida's story, \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" (which refers to a short-story publication of Vida's that is mysteriously missing its final chapter) is a real page-turner. Drawing on the likes of the [[ASIN:145374035X Bronte]] [[ASIN:1441412646 Sisters]], [[ASIN:1593082800 Wilkie Collins]], [[ASIN:0380730405 Daphne DuMaurier]], and other prolific Gothic writers for inspiration, Setterfield has woven a ghostly mystery that fits all its puzzle pieces together in a pleasing whole, whilst leaving a central enigma in place for the reader to ponder long after the book is complete.<br /><br />The writing is evocative, but not exceptional, the characters are intriguing but not three-dimensional, the plot-twist is enlightening, but can be seen a mile away - and yet this is an above-average book, perfect for a cold winter day, with a swift plot, poignant resolution, and a great love of books that any fellow book-lover can appreciate.<br /><br />That is, any lover of Gothic fiction. Suffice to say, if you are not a fan of this particular genre and the deliberate melodrama that it fosters, then you will not be impressed by this volume either. This is a Gothic story in the truest sense of the word, where emotions run high, intrigues are of the most scandalous sort, and everything takes place in a dark mansion that if not haunted by ghosts, has enough bitter, twisted, insane individuals to make up for it.<br /><br />Only two things really bothered me: that the fascinating character of Isabelle leaves the story in a rather uncharacteristic and disappointing way, and that the final post script is pure cheese (I wish I'd stopped at the second-to-last chapter which ends on an appropriate note of dry humor, rather than read of a strange reunion that had already been resolved with another character's passing, and which shifted the book into the realm of pseudo-spirituality, all completely unnecessarily).<br /><br />I read \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" over the course of three days, which included a very long night, and I enjoyed it immensely. Is it life-changing literature? Of course not! And it's not trying to be: it's entertainment, pure and simple, with (as Miss Winter is clear to point out) a beginning, middle and an end.over the course of three days, which included a very long night, and I enjoyed it immensely.

B002QGUFWE|5.0|I am amazed at Lady Gaga.  What makes her all the more impressive is that I'd originally written her off as someone that only kids would like.     With this two-disc album, she proves that she can pretty much do anything.     First of all, out of the 20 or so songs on the album, maybe 2 sound filler.  The rest all sound single-worthy.  All of these songs could have made smash singles: STARSTRUCK, BOYS BOYS BOYS, PAPER GANGSTA, MONSTER, DANCE IN THE DARK.  Second, Lady Gaga offers amazing versatility.  Yes, there are the inescapable smash hits POKER FACE and BAD ROMANCE.  But you'll get a surprising mix of sounds, from cute catchy pop to darker/synth/goth pop, rock ballads and even some gospel!  Her vocals are on point and for a pop singer, it's very surprising to say that I was able to truly hear HER.     5/5
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This review contains smallish spoilers.    First of all I love the hunger games books. Its my favorite series ever. But overall I was very disapointed at this ebing to a great series. The other two where so fantastic but this one was just depressing. Sure it was well written and  couldnt put it down but the characters really bothered me. Katniss was mentally crazy the whole time and didnt do anything to help herself at all. But the thing that was the worst was Peeta. It was bad enough that he wasnt there for like half the book. But when he did come back I was so happy. Hes my favorite character because he was so sweet and kind and great to be around. I loved reading about him and Katniss together. But when the capitol made him not love Katniss anymore I wanted to sceam. Then Haymitch said that he wasnt getting any better and I wished I hadnt read it at all so I could just have the old image in my head of him. When she wrote that I would have prefered that he die while still being himself. He even talked unlike him and lashed out at people randomly. But eventually he starts to sort of care for Katniss but more as an ally than even a freind. There were two times when he and Katniss reconected but it was too breif. You know he will never be the same again. Its heartbreaking. Then Katniss decides to kill herself but has no way of doing so. This book only gets three stars because it was well written and in the end Peeta loves Katniss again. That last paragraph was the happiest ending ever. Oh and the fact that she chose Peeta over Gale which was the best choice she made in the whole book. THE END.
B0017SWPXY|2.0|This was an interesting concept to write in the 1st person as a dog but it is a bit over the top.  First the writing is a bit simplistic, but more critically it is way over the top to imagine all this thought (however simplistic) was really coming from a dog ~ and I love dogs.  Haven`t skimmed a book quite so much in a long time.

B003HLM2QO|3.0|I rarely give less than a 5 star review, but extremely disappointed with Ozzy's new realease.  Don't get me wrong.  It has absolutey nothing to do with his band.  They are obviously TOP NOTCH.  Gus G is an amazing guitar player, and Rob Zombie's rythym section is amazing!!  What pisses me off is that Ozzy doesn't write albums with the band anymore.  I hate that he put's out corporate crap he writes with the producer.  Diggin Me Down was the only song I liked.  Had a nice Sabbath vibe.  Sit down with Gus, Ozzy and write another Blizzard Of Ozz or Diary of a Madman!!!  I guranatee he can do it!!!
0439023513|3.0|***CONTAINS SPOILERS***  Hmm. I'll start with the things I did like:  It kept me up late nights. You just kept wanting more and more and even though I disagreed with some of the events, I still kept reading.  The middle of the book had me saying, \\"This is my favorite, by far.\\"  However.  I just finished it about an hour ago and am still crying. Its so depressing!! Pretty much every character I loved, died. I have been Team Peeta forever, and I love that they got together, but the way she ended it with Gale did not sit well with me. The whole ending didn't sit well with me!  Oh, and don't even get me started with Prim.  Prim's death was so completely unneccesary. Hadn't all this started because of Prim?! Prim was why Katniss was fighting!!! She even said Prim was the only person she was completely certain she loved.  And the endings of Finnick, Madge and Cinna were just awful to me.  Finnick came to be a very important character, and you just have him eaten by a mutt? Whats up with that?  And Cinna. She never even clarified that he was dead. The last we saw of him was halfway through Catching Fire.  And whats up with Madge? She goes back to District 12, poof, Madge dead. Wow.  Also, the whole part with the Capitol being set up like an arena annoyed me. Everything seemed much more gruesome than anything we'd encountered in either of Katniss' Games.  When she was in P. Snow's mansion, the way she just curled up in a ball and screamed all the time, killing Pres. Coin, sitting in her old room in the Training Center, plotting ways to commit suicide, just... really didn't sit well with me.  And she doesn't get much of a happy ending. Why go back to District 12? Why?  Why in the world would Gale and her mother not come? Katniss needs them. And doesn't Gale love her? I guess he never did.  The ending with Peeta was very cute, but oh so bittersweet. I still don't know if Peeta fully regained his memory or not. What made her fall in love with him?  Although I shouldn't complain that she got to be with Peeta. After all, I've been hardcore Team Peeta from the beginning.  But... I don't like how it happened. I miss the old Peeta. Because since she never clarified that he got his memory back, it was like a new person falling in love with Katniss.  If only old Peeta knew that he would have kids with Katniss. I think new Peeta doesn't appriciate it as much, you know?  Finally, what are they're kids names? I know its stupid, but I really would've liked to have known.  This really helped get my emotions out!  Well, I'm sad. Because I don't think I'll be able to ever pick up any of the Hunger Games books again without bursting into tears everytime Katniss has a laugh with Madge, Finnick, Cinna, or Prim.  This book has left me depressed.
B001OQCV6K|1.0|I would love to give a glowing revue of the BD version of this movie, but I can't. Not because the movie is bad, but because after being forced to wait through the commercials, my Memorex BD player displayed a blank screen as it played the title music then refused to do anyting else.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Like others, I went to this with zero advertising exposure. My only decision point was that it's a Chris Nolan movie. I'm also one of those people who like Batman Begins much better than The Dark Knight.    Having seen Inception, I agree absolutely on 3 points: 1) The less you know going in the first time, the better off you are. 2) You must see it at least 2 times. 3) It is far, far better the 2nd time you see it.    Here's my advice: See it once. Read the interviews with Nolan and Dicaprio, read about what was their primary creative goal. Wait a week or two. Then see it a second time, and be prepared to be knocked on your ass.    I have to confess, another reason I saw Inception was that Avatar utterly blew me away. I saw Avatar twice, and I found it mind-boggling. It wasn't just the technology, even more, it was the character of Neytiri. I still think that Zoe Saldana caused a brain-fry in the Academy Award nominating process. Yet great as the acting is in Avatar, I think the acting in Inception is even better, because that's Inception's focus. If you get inside this movie, you will be on a first-name basis with every character that has a name. They are all etched in a living flame.    I wanted Inception to convince me that Avatar had not rendered \\"conventional\\" movie making obsolete. Mission accomplished. How? I believe the characters of Inception are even stronger than the characters of Avatar, because Inception is based in a world everyone already knows. Nolan and the actors and actresses were able to devote themselves to making the best characters they possibly could. Inception may be the greatest ensemble movie ever made, and I include The Magnificent Seven.    I will also say that I see a certain ethos within Inception. Again, I don't want to give it away. Everyone deserves a chance to see the movie and interpret it for themselves. But for me, I rank Inception as equal among the greatest movies I have ever seen. Dom and Mal, and all these people, will liveinside me so long as I live.

B000BT97AO|5.0|Mirrormask<br /> by Neil Gaimon and Dave McLean<br />Book Review:<br /><br />This original Novella is Helena's tale, written by master storyteller Neil Gaimon  and accompanied by original art by Dave McLean and images from the film; it is a stunning and magical journey.  Spoken in Helena's own voice, it has colour, wit and good continuity.<br /><br />Within the first two pages the book has the reader totally enthralled and Dave McKean's illustrations create a scene which is enveloping..  The master storyteller Helena is a part of a circus group whose mother is taken to hospital and is supported and protected by other members of the group which increases her worry, her tension and her fears for the future.<br /><br />Helena's adventure is built around a dream into which she is absorbed. She is a performer in a travelling circus which makes enough money to survive (at times) and when Helena's mother is taken to hospital and with her mind filled with worry, her dreams take over her fears, imagination and thoughts of the future.  She would really like to have a life that is normal but in her dreams the nightmare gets tangled with the Mirrormask.  This is a mask which gives the illusion that there are more customers than really are present<br /><br />Some of the characters in her dream help her while some hinder her way.  After many adventures Helena awakens and  \\"With the Mirrormask on, I can see everything.and the White Queen (her mother who has  been ill ) opens her eyes\\"<br /><br />Mirrormask is a beautifully written, well structured, imaginative story which provides a challenge to the imagination of all of it's readers.<br /><br />This is a 5 star book and will bring much pleasure to its readers.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tom Hampstead author of the soon to be published \\"The Kingdom of the Two Great Houses\\"
B000PDYVVG|1.0|I hate to say something bad about someone else's life/experience. However, since she has put it out there, it is fair to be critical. There were a few sections which held my attention, but over all it was a boring and unlikely tale.
B00171LFG4|5.0|Updated: 10/2015 for remastered/expanded edition.<br /><br />One of Van Morrison's seminal albums &quot;His Band &amp; Street Choir&quot; doesn't get the praiseof &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; or &quot;Moondance&quot; but it is every bit as great as those two albums focusing much more on Morrison's R&amp;B roots than those two other albums even if it isn't as groundbreaking in the way the other two albums were when released.<br /><br />This remastered edition (very nicely done by Chris Bell) sounds exceptionally good on CD. It's a pity we won't get a physical high def version (high def downloads will, no doubt, be coming shortly for this version).<br /><br />Housed in a mini-cardboard gate fold sleeve with a booklet featuring notes on the making of the album, there aren't any new songs that haven't seen the light of day here. We do, however, get five bonus alternate takes/mixes. &quot;Call Me Up (I'm In Dreamland&quot; (take 10), &quot;Give Me A Kiss&quot; (take 2), &quot;Gypsy Queen&quot; (take 3), &quot;I've Been Working&quot; (alternate version), &quot;I'll Be Your Lover, Too&quot; (alternate version) all give us a glimpse into the final versions.<br /><br />Did we need an expanded version? Not really but it's nice to have it and the fact that this has been remastered takes advantage of the improved analog to digital transfers that started becoming the norm in the 90's (although they were badly abused with obscenely bad mastering that occasionally occurred).<br /><br />Highly recommended.
1438509480|2.0|I really like Marcus Aurelius and his meditations, but I really did not like this interpretation. The author uses words like \\"hath\\" and \\"feareth\\". These meditations were originally written in Greek and this book was published in 2009, so I don't see any good purpose for the pontificating classical English interpretation. And such a translation warrants a warning of some kind. \\"This material is an inaccurate contextualization of the original work, which suggests a time and place disconnected from the actual time and place the author lived in. The original work has been interpreted using a language style foreign to both, the original author and the modern reader\\". That being said, it may really appeal to Shakespearean junkies.

This makes no sense and I find it to be like a slap in the face after spending so much money on the kindle device in the first place.  Shame on you, Amazon.  I have recently purchased an iPad and I can now read many different digital formats.  If Amazon kindle format is going to be so expensive I will shop elsewhere.
B000W1V5VU|5.0|13 is my favorite of the three.  The rapport between Cloony & Pitt is marvelous, as it is too with the entire ensemble.  Highly recommended as a good old fashioned movie - ironic given its' setting in Vegas.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Like most fans of the first two books of the trilogy, I was really looking forward to the release of Mockingjay, and preordered it to be downloaded to my Kindle. What a disappointment!!! The character development just isn't there in Mockingjay.  Katniss is a whining brat with fleeting loyalties and commitments.  Collins kills people off for shock value.  It's as though Collin's mind was under the influence of the \\"jacks,\\" not Peetas'.  I didn't like it at all.
B00336G7HI|5.0|Bought this for use with the Sony Flash Camcorder that was purchased at the same time.  Was the perfect addition to have providing enough backup power during the whole day.  Extra power for picture taking on trips and special events.  Would recommend purchase of this item.
B003JTHETY|5.0|This Maiden album is one of their top 5, easy! Is it a bit different sounding? -yes, but when you're done listening to the album you look back and think, \\"That was definately Iron Maiden dude!\\" If you're looking for something different, this is one of those albums.     This so called \\"bonus edition\\" however, SUCKS! The only thing I liked about the extra content, were a couple of the cool pictures, that's it! By the way, it was all online. The sticker on the back looks like a new born baby put it on there for god's sake!     However, if you look at the charts, they speak for themselves. This an album that'll go down in Maiden history, for sure. Like some Iron's say, every Iron Maiden song has a purpose and meaning! So go out and buy another great Iron Maiden album!     p.s.  I'm not trying to be a big music critic like SOME of the other people and their reviews.
1439165645|5.0|Richard Morais has created in vivid, mouth-watering detail a culinary journey that brings together the best of indian and French cuisine.  He uses wonderful character development to bring the story to life and as a result, you'll laugh and cry with them.  I loved this book.
B003V4JU08|1.0|I love NCIS, the characters developed and the actors can act, they have formed a great team and I cannot wait to get the new series, I watch them over and over.  NCIS LOS ANGELES started well with the first pilot episode - I now realise that this was only because they had the original NCIS cast in the show - but from then on it went from bad to worse.  No leader to make decisions, a manager who checks the wardrobe and a rapper who can not act, the team flounders and plot lines are so crazy and unbelievable with so many loose ends that it makes you think its all ad lib and does not even have a script.  The mistakes they make are horrendous and you know the outcome from the first ten minutes.  I bought the series expecting great things but all you get is brawn and no brain, shoot first - and always to kill so the bad guys can never answer questions - and mop up after.  If you like a bit of action with guns etc you will love this, but if you want a bit more of a story with some good acting don't go there.  YUK.

B000HC2LI0|1.0|My husband is a huge West Wing fan and I got him this set.  He's been watching the series on the weekends and it was only this past weekend (months since I purchased boxed set)that he finished disk 17 and eagerly loaded disk 18.  Unfortunately - disk 18 was not included.  Instead - another copy of disk 15 was where disk 18 should have been.  How can a set be called \\"Complete\\" when there is a disk missing?
B0026P3G12|4.0|A beautiful CD.  The only drawback is Silent Night, which is out of place.
B0000DJE9R|1.0|The CD was quickly delivered but is a blank CD. Everything looked legitimate with the plastic sleeve the CD was in and everything else but the CD has NOTHING ON IT!! This will be the first and last time i will purchase something from Amazon. Yes it was a small purchase but you'd think you would get the small things right!!!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Best CD I ever bought.  I knew it was a compilation when I bought it, but I didn't know that it had been re-mastered, re-mixed - or that it was for a stage show of Cirque Du Soleil.  I listened to this end-to-end while on a road trip, and couldn't get the smile off my face.  I was delighted with the way that vocals had been brought to the foreground on some songs, and the sound levels on different instruments were brought to the foreground on others.  And the transitions between songs were pure genius.  This is definitely my \\"desert isle\\" CD.
B003INBNXO|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I loved it. Looking at the box I thought it would be just another cheap karate movie but wow...it was great.

0439023513|3.0|Preface: Having read a few things about Collins, I wasn't surprised that the real agenda of her book is about how corrupt governments affect people's lives.  She seems to try to direct the reader into feeling that no form of governemt is to be trusted, and since this is a YA novel, it is a little disturbing to me.  I know that governments everywhere are infiltrated with evil, power-hungry politicians, but on a whole, I do feel that there are those in polititcal positions who do have some moral character and they aren't driven just by greed and power.<br /><br />As far as the book itself, it's a very disappointing lack of character development for Katniss.  She seems to be so influential and dangerous as to capture the attention of major goverenment leaders, yet so inconsiquential and paralyzed to really do much good.  I think the author wants to portray her that way to show how the people in power just continue to use her as a pawn.  However, I don't think it fits well with how Collins has tried to portray her earlier as a strong, smart, bit of a rebel with a disregard for rules and regulations.  And the end of the book is a complete disappointment.  If you're reading it to feel closure or for the romance, this book wont deliver.  Katniss remains a heartless, self-centered character throughout the book, and seems to never learn how to really love anyone.  I think that is the point the author wants to drive home.  I feel there could've been a way for her to learn to love, Collins just didn't want to take it that direction.<br /><br />I also think the violence and gore were over the top.  I know this is a book about war, but it seems Collins was trying to think of anything she possibly could to disgust and disturb her readers with the lenghts the Capitol would go to.  I know war is hell, but I don't neccesarily want to read all about it in a YA novel.  Some of the sci-fi weapons of war are just too much, to the point of being almost ridiculous.<br /><br />All in all, if you've read the first 2 books, you'll still want to read this one.  But prepare to be left feeling somewhat hopeless and that you never really have a great resolution.irst 2 books, you'll still want to read this one.

B0015ABRE2|5.0|I viewed the third season of Dexter on cable when it was first shown (as I did the previous 2).  I am a HUGE Dexter fan, he seems like an everyman's Hannibal Lextor.  Even though I can access all of the Dexter seasons on my DVR I have purchased all of these DVD collections in order to share the dark wonders of Dexter with friends and family.  One of my friends has blown through the first 2 seasons in 3 days and is working on season three right now (she blames me for what she calls \\"her Dexter jones\\").  A great series and a very good value.  Get 'em, watch 'em and share 'em!

Great job guys!! Starting with SUPERMAN/BATMAN:PUBLIC ENEMIES and now red hood.. I'm lovin' DC all over again.Hopefully they'll  Keep it going with APOCALYPSE and soon to be released SHAZAM flicks.<br />Not just for kids anymore..adults are loving the new stuff too.
B00005221M|1.0|Waited like many others in GREAT anticipation for the DVD of this film to come out and was COMPLETELY let down.  No Clannad song, good lines and good scenes cut out, stupid lines and awkward meaningless scenes put in.  What on earth were you thinking, Mr. Director?  We wanted the theatrical version.  We STILL want the theatrical version.  PLEASE I beg you re-release the theatrical version on DVD and/or BluRay.
0439023483|5.0|My Summary: In a futuristic society, the United States is no more. In it's place is Panem, and only twelve of the original thirteen districts remain.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen, a resident of the coal-producing District Twelve, prepares for The Reaping by making sure that her little sister Prim has as few entries as possible. Yet, against the odds, Prim is picked and Katniss volunteer's in her place to be a tribute for the yearly Hunger Games.<br /><br />She knows the odds aren't good. 24 tributes in all, and only one can survive. It will be a fight to the death, against people she cares about, and only the strong and smart can survive...<br /><br />Review: Action-filled, surprising moments, smartly plotted and equally smart characters...can this book get any better?<br /><br />The Hunger Games is one of those series that is addictive, smart, and very well plotted. She uses the skills her father taught her about hunting in order to help her family survive (which is illegal). She hunts with her best friend Gale, to keep both their families alive and well. However, once Katniss becomes a tribute, she has to focus on one thing only: survival. Staying true to her character, Katniss doesn't become some bloodthirsty beast, she gets smart, uses her wits and skills in the arena, as well as forms alliances...but only one person can survive in the end.<br /><br />Each character is well developed, with their own personalities. I didn't like every character, but that's what made them all more real to me, because you can't like everyone (although, I loved Haymitch! So funny!).<br /><br />The description flows perfectly, the surprises don't fail to shock, and the end gives you both fulfillment (there's nothing too cliffhangerish) and curiosity for the next installment, Catching Fire.<br /><br />This trilogy is perfect for anyone who enjoys a good dystopia novel, with action, adventure, a dash of romance, and plenty of moments where you will be unable to tear yourself away from the book.<br /><br />Highlights: In a game of survival, I didn't know what to expect next. I love how smart Katniss is, and she uses everything she has. The girl is smart, and focused, which is wonderful to read about. I enjoyed Collins' writing as well, it's very easy to fall into and get caught up in the story.<br /><br />Lowlights: I'm not really a fan of the name \\"Katniss\\", but it's grown on me through the years. And really, it's kind of a petty thing to consider a \\"lowlight\\".know what to expect next. I love how smart Katniss is, and she uses everything she has.

B002KQ6BT6|4.0|The \\"Lost Symbol\\" was a good book full of mystery and suspense.  Dan Brown deviated from his standard prologue format which was disappointing.  I thought that parts of the book were apologies for \\"Da Vinci Code\\" he had his opinions and he told them like he believed them, which is what any good author should do.  I saw this as a response to the back lash for writing such a controversial book.   Other than that i highly recommend this novel
0439023513|3.0|Readers of Stephen King know that the Hunger Games was a derivative story that was borrowed from two of King's \\"Bachman\\" novellas, \\"The Long Walk\\" and \\"Running Man.\\"  It also heavily leaned on material from Battle Royale - a story and movie (not sure which came first) where junior high school students are forced to kill each other on an island until only one is left.  So those who contend that Collins' concept for the Hunger Games is original are unfortunately mistaken.<br /><br />That being said, there can be no doubt that Collins took this storyline and improved upon it.  She managed to create three great turn-paging novels that are compelling for both teenagers and adults.  Central to the success of these books is the character development of Katniss.  Collins created a wonderful protagonist who is unaware of many of her considerable talents and the impression of strength that she projects.<br /><br />In the first two books, Katniss is presented as strong, smart, resourceful and attractive.  Although there is a ton of adventure and excitement in the first two novels, a big part of their appeal stems from the fact that Collins is telling a coming of age story about a young woman who is learning about herself and the extent of her abilities.  There are important lessons about self-reliance, confidence and the hidden power of being unassuming.<br /><br />Unfortunately, in Mockingjay, Collins departs from this compelling aspect of her first two novels. Instead of showing how Katniss continues to evolve into a smart and self-aware leader, Collins turns her into a pawn with emotional problems who is being used by both sides.  For some inexplicable reason, Collins seems intent on delivering a sophomoric lesson about the nature of evil governments and power.  While such issues can be highly interesting in the contect of a novel, Collins is not saying anything particularly deep or original.  And she does this at the expense of developing Katniss into a fully drawn woman who can handle the world on her own terms.  The full extent of Katniss' emotional degeneration is really not clear until the last 100 pages.  As a result, the sense of let down is strongest at the end of the novel.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Although Mockingjay is very readable and, like the first two books, has a great page turning quality, the conclusion is a bit disappointing and hollow.  If you've read the first two books, you will probably want to read this installment -- but do so with managed expectations.
B002ZG9846|5.0|I rented this on appletv one night last weekend. I had heard some friends talk about it but hadn't really paid that much attention. OMG, I loved this movie. I bought a digital version on itunes, the blu-ray version of the movie, the comic book and the soundtrack. This movie just leaves you with a great feeling, but at the same time you want to know more about these characters'. I'll second what others have said, this is definitely my favorite movie this year.
0439023513|1.0|I wasn't liking the book in general, it was going to slow for me at some parts and it was just WAY too depressing for me, seeing Katniss's world through her prospective while everything was crashing down around her. Too many people were dying, too many tears were shed. It's not something I want to read during my stressful life. When I finished the book, I was madder than I ever have been. I hated how the book ended, I hated the story. The first two books were absolutley amazing, but i have to say Suzanne Collins murdered the entire series with that book.
B002ZG9788|4.0|This was a worthy remake of a classic adventure. Many remakes muddy up the previous version without improvement. This remake is at least as close to the last in the special effects relm. It creates new effects to rival any movie James Cameron did not make. A good exciting evening is in store for all. Enjoy
1594488916|3.0|There are a lot of great elements for a story here - the relatively unknown subculture of book collectors, the dark side of this hobby and the curiously engaging criminal who becomes the focus of the book. But the longer it went, the less it carried my interest. I guess I was expecting the action to heat up more than cool off. I'm glad to have read it, but mildly disappointed it didn't live up to promise. (Probably should be 3.5 stars.) Maybe the material just wasn't there.

0891419063|5.0|I have nothing but good things to say about this book.  It is an easy read I did not want to put down.  I was drawn to read it after seeing The Pacific miniseries and recommend both to anyone that would like to understand as best they can through words and pictures what war was like in the Pacific theater.  Sledge does an excellent job of describing his experiences via all five senses.  I have not read many first hand accounts but none have transported me into a war zone as well.  With the Old Breed is a gem and required reading for any WWII buff.

B003FK8V7G|5.0|I don't think American Slang has the same \\"wow factor\\" as the other records, but at the same time I think it's bolder for that reason.<br /><br />The variety of musical styles and the lack of a clear single other than the title track really reminds me a bit of the chance that Springsteen took with The River. Coming off a pair of successful and stylistically-indistinguishable hits (Born to Run and Darkness on the Edge of Town), he made this eclectic record that wouldn't have much commercial appeal if not for his own built-in fanbase, but where he dipped his toes into so many areas that he really set the tone for his next ten studio records. At the time, a lot of people didn't think it stood up next to \\"Darkness\\" but years later, it's perceived--especially by the Springsteen hardcores--as one of his best records.<br /><br />Of course, inherent in that is the fact that the songs are GOOD. Even if I say there isn't a clear single, it's an enjoyable record and it's clear what they were trying to do on every track. That's why I think it'll hold up in the final analysis.
0470876417|5.0|This is a fantastic book that is changing how I think of my company's work.  Though primarily targeted to for-profit companies not-for-profits can learn a lot from this model.  Very helpful!  I encourage anyone who leads a company to read this book and start drafting a plan!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I think everyone in America should see this movie.  It was  such a shock to see how only 4 companies control  the  food that is produced in the United States and how greedy they  are and how they don't care if we get sick from the food they  produce.      The movie was very well done and I hope more people watch it and  maybe speak out on the behalf of the American public.
0439023513|3.0|*Spoiler    Katniss is an incredible character and the suspense throughout the third installment is phenomenal.  Yet the integrity of the entire plot is thrown into question at the novel's conclusion with what turns out to be a very rushed and unsatisfying ending.     As Katniss fights with the rebel cause in the first half of the story, Peeta becomes a very minor character that fades into the background.  Yes, we know she is upset about Peeta.  Yes, we know she feels guilty about Peeta being tortured.  Yet Katniss never seeks to save him, never mentions a rescue plan of any kind.  The only thing we get from her is that if he somehow survives, she wants immunity for him.  For me as the reader, this went against the very grain of the second book, when it seemed as if she would sacrifice everything to help Peeta, even if we as readers couldn't be sure that she would choose him as a lover.  Katniss seems to be reduced to a character of circumstance- helpless but putting on a good game face as she works herself through the motions of her new life in District 13.  To me, this is not the same Katniss we grew to love and respect as a character in the first two novels.    As Peeta seems to fade into the background, Collins draws Gale out to the surface.  Even the most diehard of Peeta fans will find themselves wondering if a life with Gale is really what is destined for Katniss.  And yet as the suspense builds toward the center of the novel, with descriptions of elaborate weaponry and unimaginable attack plans, it's as if Collins can't make up her mind about what to focus her suspense-building on and gives up on the entire romantic angle altogether.  Gale cools off and, as Peeta is sort of introduced back into the plot, almost fades out completely.  This wouldn't be so bad -if- we felt a stronger connection between Katniss and Peeta.  The most the reader will get from Collins, however, is a very awkward and nervous sort of tension in scenes with crazed Peeta and frazzled Katniss.      In the final segment of the book, the romantic aspect of the plot becomes a minor character and we begin to focus on the blood, guts and gore of the rebel cause.  This is a crucial story element to be sure.  Yet if Collins had successfully interwoven the romantic plot with the suspenseful action one, this book would have blown us out of the water.  Instead, we must settle on an ending that most of us could see coming by about a third of the way into the novel.  The bad guys lose, Katniss achieves vengeance on her own terms- sort of- and she ends up with a guy.  But speaking of that, did she get the guy she really wanted or the guy who simply stuck around?  I was pleased with who she ultimately ended up with but Ms. Collins, could you have saved us the trite cat ending and given us about five more pages that could have fleshed out the romantic plot a little better?  The epilogue was nice but this could have been so much better.      I hope in the future Ms. Collins will conduct an interview and explain some of these choices.
B003JTHESA|2.0|I tried to like this, but it just seemed like the same musical ideas and lyric themes being spun out for the umpteenth time.  Which is shame, because in addition to all of the classic Maiden (everything prior to \\"Somewhere in Time\\"), I found \\"Brave New World\\" to be quite enjoyable.  This album, on the other hand, just didn't have anything in it to make we want to listen to it again.
B00005ASGG|5.0|This is one of the finest westerns made.  The black and white film gives it an even older feel.  Lee Marvin plays one of the greatest screen villains ever!
B001OQCV2E|1.0|With the top-notch actors and previews with awesome special effects, I expected an exciting film. Wrong! This movie fell flat. What's worse is that it's long. If not for the outstanding special effects and Woody Harrelson's role, the film is a total zero. Terrible writing, plot development and execution. Basically, a terrible movie.
0385340567|1.0|I was more than 75 percent into the book before I found out what people didn't like about it.  What a terrible, pathetic attempt at an ending.  I would not have thought that Lee Child was capable of such a pathetic attempt.    I assume that the author was so committed to making a political statement that he trashed his readers.  I don't really know and I don't care about his political slant.  I do know that it was torture trying to read the end of the book.  I doubt I will read another Lee Child novel.      I have seen it before.  Authors who become wealthy and then torture their fans with political views and convoluted story lines.  What a shame.
B0017HPHBM|4.0|Batman Begins is an amazing movie and the two-disc deluxe edition is an amazing combination. Tons of great special features that give you a unique insight into Christopher Nolan and David Goyer's thoughts about Batman's story.    The two-disc set alone would easily worth five stars, but as this is a limited edition gift set I gave it four because I feel that the extra \\"gifts\\" that come with the two-disc set aren't really anything too cool or exciting.    Awesome movie, if the gift set costs more than the two-disc set alone then buy only the two-disc set.
0439023513|2.0|I was very disappointed with this book.  I feel I wasted several hours reading it.
B002WY65VU|3.0|Horror movie spoofs are becoming pretty common--some of them are great (\\"Scream\\"), while others are just forgettable. The really good ones manage to both spoof the genre and simultaneously exploit its effectiveness. \\"Zombieland\\" does just that. The main character has developed a list of rules for surviving a zombie apocalypse, which we can easily assume he has developed from watching lots and lots of zombie movies. These rules flash on the screen at strategic moments, and we come to appreciate their wisdom. The plot, although clever and amusing, is subordinate to the characters here--Jesse Eisenberg as our hero (who suffers from Irritable Bowel Syndrome, a definite handicap when one is fighting zombies), Woody Harrelson as the bad-ass who's hiding deep sorrow, Abigail Breslin (yes, the girl from \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\") as a rough tween who fears nothing, and Bill Murray in a hysterical but all-too-brief cameo. This one is good scary fun.
B000002UVZ|5.0|You can't really describe this album, you just have to listen to it. One of the best records of the rock & roll era - every track is infused with joy and meaning. Blew me away when it came out & it still does today...
B001DSNELA|5.0|This is as good as a Bond dvd set can get. Not only is Casino Royale the best James Bond movie ever, but the action scenes make for fantastic behind the scenes special features. You also get tons of interviews and even two audio commentaries to go along with the feature film. Lots of insight into the lure of James Bond.
157421327X|4.0|Friend told me about process so I was interested to see what it was all about.  Book arrived safe and sound though I have yet to try technique!
B002DKGWSE|3.0|Another in the current spate of horror movie remakes, this one is actually quite good and creepy. If you've seen the original, you know the story--two teenage girls are abducted and abused by a group of marauding baddies, who then seek shelter at the home of one of their victims. All sorts of suspense and opportunities for vengeance arise, and the payoff is both gruesome and satisfying. Some subtle plot points have been modified very effectively, so somehow this one manages to be even more graphic and squirm-inducing than the original, which was considered edgy for its time. If gruesome terror is your thing, this is a good one.
0439023513|5.0|After following Katniss Everdeen's story through the first two books, I hoped for a fitting conclusion to this great story. When I finished this book a couple of nights ago, I was stunned and left with a feeling of cold emptiness at how Katniss's story was concluded. This is actually a good thing.    I have never really read a book before that has made me feel for the characters as much as this series. This book was well-written and moving. Highly recommended.
0439023513|1.0|the hunger games and catching fire had me dying for the finale, but mockingjay ruined any former excitement i had for the series. i was bored for most of the novel but kept reading anyway in the hope of a fulfilling ending where katniss's relationships with peeta and gale are finally addressed and settled, but that didn't even happen until literally the last few pages. i almost feel like the novel was poorly edited because pages are wasted on pointless descriptions of pre-combat scenes, so i could often skim through paragraphs without missing anything slightly relevant.    (SPOILERS) i can basically summarize the novel right here: suzanne collins writes about district 13 preparing for battle with the capitol for over 300 pages, some of the rebels from 13 arrive in the capitol and katniss conveniently passes out, katniss awakens and president snow has somehow been overthrown, katniss goes home in the last ten pages, and then katniss picks her husband on basically the second to last page. the end. (along the way, many characters are spontaneously disposed of and basically all character relationships are ignored. nothing fulfilling here.)    this novel had huge potential to be a powerful end to a great series, but it completely and utterly missed the mark. it would be nice if the entire book could be re-written or simply thrown away since all it does is ruin what would have been a good trilogy.
B003ES5JE2|4.0|Yes, this is a great Batman story, I can't give it a 5 star just because it only run for a bit longer than an hour. I wished this had been a full on 2 Hour or so film. This story was so complex, dark and action packed that it deserved to be developed a lot more. It is clear that this kind of film is geared towards a more mature audience, and having the longer film would satisfy all of us Batman fans... Let's hope DC realizes this sooner than later as I really want to watch an evolution in the development of these straight to DVD comics.  Other than that, this is a great film! You will not regret watching this. I don't want to give out too much, but the story is about Batman's failure to rescue the 2nd Robin from the Joker and the events that followed after that.
B0009VRHLK|1.0|What are you people talking about? Forget all good reviews posted here. THE FILM IS CRAP.<br />Watch it if you want (like myself) to see the Chloe Sevigny doing a fellatio. The film has an excuse (or meaning if you like) for the wanderings of the hero, but why such graphic sex scene? I can only assume Mr Gallo is trying secure audience. Maybe is because I don't have an open mind...Get lost: sexual liberation is from the seventies, man! This is no Caligula, which even the porn scenes can't spoil the film.
0439023513|5.0|I thought the final book to this series was great. Definetly not what i expected, but then again, i didn't expect it to be. it's a story of what war can do to you, in all aspects. shame it had to come to an end, it seems lie only yesterday i was opening up the first book.
B0014DBZY2|5.0|I am always starved for new music & the majority sucks, but these guys don't! It's hard to categorize them, because they're kind of sad/sappy upon the first few listens, but then it grows on you & becomes the furthest thing from sad & sappy. It's an album that provides more excitement & energy then anything in recent memory & is still one of my favorite albums for about 1 1/2 years now. The singer kind of has a Smiths/Morrissey/English Indie Rock type of approach that isn't that unique in itself, but becomes absolutely perfect for the instrumentation.     The key to this band being fantastic isn't the vocals, but yet the dynamics of what's going on behind the vocals. The guitars are clean & have a tonal depth that makes one note seem more powerful & important then a highly distorted beefed-up power chord. At times the guitars build to an unusual complexity that become ever more exciting because you know that an even more exciting crescendo, or harmonic shift is coming up & it's hard to not be entranced. One of the few albums recently I listen to that is truly inspiring. The engineering/mix on this album has a lot to do with how fantastic it is also. Everything really shines & has great depth.

0743289692|4.0|INFIDEL is a remarkable story of a girl born in Somalia in late 1969, who sought asylum in Holland in 1992 to escape a family-planned marriage, became well-known for speaking out against commonplace atrocities committed against Muslim women in the name of Allah, and became a Liberal Party member of the Dutch Parliament. It is not primarily a story of a rise from abject poverty; her father was from a dominant Somalian clan and actually led a resistance movement against the current Somalian strongman. However, for the 1970s, the material circumstances of her childhood were crude and backwards. But this is a story of the deleterious impacts of the all-consuming presence of religion, that is Islam, in her life and the dominance of clan traditions, which were aligned with religious demands. The sheer inhumanity countenanced by Islam, including the subjugation of women and the advocacy of killing non-believers, forced Ali to realize that she could no longer accept the religion of her youth.<br /><br />The first half of the book follows Ali as she lives in Somalia, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia, and mostly Kenya. Muslims were a minority in Kenya, but her family rigorously complied with Muslim practices including the most heinous of them, female mutilation. Held down, her female parts were excised by scissors and then she was sewn shut - now she was \\"pure.\\" She did attend religious-based schools and a secretarial school. She was clandestinely married at one point for days; her husband left, but not until a nightmarish wedding night. The first part of the book does get bogged down in recounting numerous indignities and religious practices, involving too many people to remember, and the harsh restrictions of her temper-prone mother.<br /><br />The story begins in earnest when Ali in 1992 diverts from Germany, where she was supposedly waiting for a visa to join her family-selected husband in Canada, to Holland and asks for political asylum as a Somalian refugee. Holland was an absolute shock to Ali. Never had she seen such order and efficiency both in the infrastructure and in the people. Here was a state that actually had the capacity and willingness to assist those in need. Authorities in her previous life were to be feared regardless of source: family, religion, or government. Acquiring asylum status, she was given housing and benefits. With no small effort on her part, she completed several levels of schooling which eventuated in her receiving a Masters Degree in political science from the prestigious University of Leiden in 2000. During that time she also worked as a translator in any number of social situations. She became increasingly aware of the vulnerable status of Muslim women even in enlightened Holland: beatings, mutilation, and even \\"honor\\" killings. She also had to contend with her beloved younger sister who she was trying to help regain her mental health; but the trauma of her harsh childhood proved to be too much - one of many Muslim girls so affected.<br /><br />Her first job out of college as a researcher for the social-democratic Labor Party propelled her into the public arena. Her attendance and speaking out at public forums and her writings gained her a reputation as an advocate for Muslim women. She eventually was elected to Parliament on the Liberal Party ticket in 2003. It was also at this time that she made a quite controversial short film with noted Dutch film producer Theo Van Gough which dramatized the female brutality condoned by Islam. The venom unleashed in some elements of the Muslim community was so profound that Van Gough was assassinated on the streets of Amsterdam in 2004 and she had to go into deep hiding under the control of the Dutch state security police.<br /><br />Beyond Ali's academic achievements and public roles, the last part of the book consists of her reflections on the contradictions and hypocrisies of Islam and the faulty thinking of the Dutch state in accommodating Islam. As Ali points out repeatedly, Islam is fundamentally not a religion based on kindness, tolerance, reason, growth of individuals, or other widely held ideas about what is best for societies. It is all right there in Quran. It is male-dominated; she wonders how a supposedly universal religion could write off half of the human race. Women in Islam are nonentities. This is the situation that the Dutch state is accepting when it permits separate Muslim institutions. The multicultural mantra is used as a shield by the Muslim community. In her opinion, their religious-based cruelties can and do proceed without restriction.<br /><br />Ali had to resign her seat in Parliament in 2006 when her notoriety almost cost her Dutch citizenship. But she remains an advocate for ending religion-based schooling in Holland, as well the end of the brutalities perpetrated against women under a religious shield. She also has called for restricted immigration of Muslims, fearing their potential dominance of Dutch politics. She is not optimistic that Muslims in any significant numbers can ever free themselves from their cage and reject the extremism of Islam.<br /><br />Ali is now an atheist. She came to that point by having to live through the immense absurdities of Islam. She does not however tackle the greater issue of whether all religions should be similarly viewed and rejected. The mayhem and cruelties perpetrated under Western religions have been quite massive through the centuries. Why should they get a free ride? Interestingly, Ali took a position with the conservative American Enterprise Institute in 2006, which is fairly consistent with her emphasis on the exercise of free choice. One can wonder whether she fully appreciates the rejection by the AEI of the welfare state; such a state gave her a second chance in life with almost no hesitation.<br /><br />The book is interesting - what a remarkable, unique person. But like most memoirs it is tedious, repetitious, and selective in what is included and emphasized. Her childhood years go on interminably. However, her adult life is far more important and fascinating. One could hope that thousands of more voices like hers might make inroads against the notion that religions are peaceful and further all mankind - an idea that is demonstrably false.lly not a religion based on kindness, tolerance, reason, growth of individuals, or other widely held ideas about what is best for societies.

0439023513|3.0|If it wasn't for the ending I would have hated this book.  I really loved the first two parts of the series so I really wanted to love the final chapter too, but I just couldn't.  There were so many things that didn't sit well with me.  For starters, Katniss bothered the crap out of me.  I couldn't stand how she treated newly unstable Peeta.  Even after Haymitch told her to ease up on him she never really displayed much compassion towards him and on more than one occasion contemplated killing him WITHOUT ANY REMORSE.  Katniss' callousness toward Peeta created a disconnect between me and the characters and what was going on in the book and so I just stopped caring and simply kept reading just find out what happens, not to experience the story.  There is also a strange part of the book where Peeta shows interest in Annie.  I guess it was there to show how far gone Peeta was, but it was kind of confusing.  I feel that Collins should have clarified this scene more. And she also could have made Katniss voting for a reverse Hunger games and then killing Coin less confusing by making Katniss' agenda more obvious.  I also think Collins should not have created a third \\"hunger games.\\"  In execution, it was kind of silly and I was just plain bored.    Throughout Mockingjay, I kept hoping Katniss would finally show us some chutzpah.  She cares when people suffer and eventually does what she can for the war effort, but she never really becomes the warrior I was hoping for her to be.  Nor does she ever really grow as a character.  She kills Coin and understands that hatred, war, and the Hunger Games is not the answer, but when it comes to relationships, it still feels like she merely settles for Peeta.  I was also hoping for something a little more shocking to happen.  A nice little twist like the capitol had Katiss' father the whole time imprisoned.  Or that Coin was working with Snow.  Or that Cinna was still alive.    As I stated above, the ending was the best part of the bookfor me.  Still, I feel Collins should have included a couple more things in the epilogue: the current political state of Panem and a brief description of the rebuilding of district 12.  To be far to Collins, it's hard to wrap up a trilogy in a way that pleases everyone especially when expectations are set so high.  Again, I didn't hate this book, but it was far from being on the level its successors are on.
630587493X|5.0|Recent reviews on robots and androids made me curious about The Bicentennial Man, directed by one of my fav directors, Chris Columbus (who had done a great job on Mrs. Doubtfire, Home Alone and the Harry Potter films) and one of my fav comedians, Robin Williams.<br /><br />Despite being marketed to the 1999 audiences of the time as a \\"hilarious comedy\\" it certainly was not!  Themes of euthanasia, corporate greed and death were certainly not funny nor for kids -- though older children may enjoy it.<br /><br />The film is about a robot who is delivered to a home to perform basic chores, except for one thing.  He has a heart and emotions and desires, impossible to program into a robot and is an anomaly.<br /><br />Being familiar with Isaac Asimov (on whose story the film is based), it was humorous to see the Three Law of Robotics emblazoned in a head- projector in the living room, to the consternation of the family!<br /><br />The family takes awhile to get used to the robot.  One girl lets the robot jump out a window!  Fear of windows and heights is briefly played.  Another has the robot (Andrew) get splashed with sand and he says, \\"I understand now why some animals eat their young!\\"<br /><br />Williams' performance is understated -- but when he runs into trouble or is dealing with a \\"fact of life\\", he states \\"That will not do!\\" and immediately does something about it.  People die?  Wear out?  What's up with that?<br /><br />The film deals with time quickly -- we're ten years ahead, then 15 more, then 20 more and so on.  In each scene, the robot is still young, immortal, learning, while his family whom he has taken care of for  many years is dying away.<br /><br />The whole film is a fascinating journey into the human condition.<br /><br />Several points of interest:  Seeking out his own kind, years in the making, finally runs into a woman robot who plays 100 year old rock tunes out of her hip!  Following her, he finds the son of the man who invented his model in the first place!  With Rupert Burns' help, Andrew invents amazing biological devices that extend human life.<br /><br />But he wants freedom, love, these intangibles.<br /><br />Another point of interest:  He feels jealousy, which surprises him.  And love, which astonishes him.  When Andrew finds that he could actually be made to \\"perform as a man\\" by inventor Rupert, Andrew says of sex: \\"It takes you to heaven, makes you as one, and then you come back and your love is at your side.\\"  Rupert:  \\"Wish I could have that!\\"<br /><br />Yes, there is comedy.  And yes there is the future San Francisco with the huge buildings and the amazing cable cars (yes, they're still there!) and flying trucks and trams.<br /><br />The film is about the human condition.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book had me hooked - that is, until the last two chapters. I am glad I read this for the sake of finishing the trilogy; however, the decisions made in the end were sorely disappointing.
B000002GK1|4.0|Badmotorfinger is the album that successfully broke Soundgarden into the mainstream, thanks to the massive success of fellow Seattle bands Nirvana and Pearl Jam. Still,  an initial listen will make people cognizant that more than mere timing is responsible for this being SG's finest accomplishment to date. It's not their most consistent album(that honor belongs to either Ultramega OK, or their early punk EPs) but it's the most heavy-hitting and most adventurous.<br /><br />Take the opener \\"Rusty Cage\\". It's got this intro with interesting push and pull between high notes and low notes before plunging into the main song that maintains a constant groove throughout. You'll still have Chris Cornell's scream of \\"I'm gonna break my rusy cage....\\" running through your head.<br /><br />Then there's \\"Outshined\\", real heavy with a solid rhythm that's quintessentially Soundgarden combined with a catchy chorus that made it a guaranteed radio hit. Then there's \\"Slaves and Bulldozers\\", featuring a brilliantly sloppy guitar solo from Kim Thayil, \\"Jesus Christ Pose\\" where the rhythm gets turned up to Mach 6, and the Sabbath-esque closer \\"New Damage\\", all topped off by Chris Cornell's amazing vocals. Besides having an excellent voice, his ability to go from high to low notes so smoothly is equaled by few rock vocalists.<br /><br />I'm only giving it a 4 out of 5 because some of the tracks are rather weak.  \\"Searching With my Good Eye Closed\\" lasts too long, and \\"Mind Riot\\" is just boring. Other than that, Badmotorfinger is the Soundgarden album to get. It's certainly much better than the underwhelming and overproduced \\"Louder Than Love\\"<br /><br />After this, Soundgarden reached that career point where bands pretty much have to go a different musical direction, go mainstream(the two are usually, but not necessarily the same) or go home. Their last 2 releases marked a more psychedelic direction. While having their fare share of good tunes, too much filler drags them down in the end.
B001PB3RU8|3.0|I bought 'Lungs' after reading many positive reviews, and must say that I am more than impressed with the performance, songwriting and arrangements on the album. With the exception of the first three songs (two of which just feel out of place on this album) every song is a winner. Florence Welch's voice takes a little getting used to, but she sings with such power and conviction that it's well worth the effort. Performance wise, this is a 4-5 star effort.    That said, I find it extremely difficult to listen to this CD. It is without a doubt one of the most (if not THE most) horribly compressed recordings I've ever had the misfortune to hear. I'm surprised that this isn't mentioned in more of the reviews on Amazon.  Whoever mastered this recording should be taken out, shot, buried, dug up and shot again. I  end up with a headache every time I listen to it.    I'm considering buying the vinyl edition in the hope that it might not suffer from the same 100% compression the CD does.  But I don't hold out much hope.
B002WIDRM6|4.0|I love listening to this CD. It is full of comfort music. The whole CD oozes \\"I am okay, you're okay\\" and \\"neither of us is perfect, let's see what we can do to get through the day\\"-music. I have taken it on several road trips now and it makes me relax and not sweat the small stuff. Neither music, voices or lyrics are not particularly groundbreaking, but as a package is it just solid. And as a result you can listen to it over and over again. It is like a warm blanket, or listening to a good friend. More matter of fact, the CD is modern country, from slow songs like American Honey to strong up tempo arrangements like Hello World. Charles Kelley's voice complements the Lady A's music and Hillary Scott add significant touches to the sound. I look forward to spend more and more hours with them on the road.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|it was great, the Package came very fast, and it was in great condition. :)
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I always feel disappointed at the end of a trilogy or series. That's expected. What it seems like I am usually disappointed about though is not the \\"end\\" per sae but how the author tied up all the sub-plots and how strongly he/she kept her characters \\"in character\\" right until the bitter end. The ending is the authors choice and I leave them a wide berth (do they go sad? bitter? happy? I'm ok with any of them).     Here is where Collins feel short. Her character development which was SO strong in book 1 and very good in book 2 just sort of fell apart in book 3. In my mind it was VERY much like the last Harry Potter where I felt both authors got rushed, lost momentum/focus and therefore lost the believability/captivation of the reader. So sad because I just adored Katniss's character...one of the best modern female characters I have ever read. In this book she really faded away as weak both mentally and physically which is...out of character. Gale developed nicely I thought (got a better idea of who he is I think?) but then she dropped him in the end in a very out-of-character way. Gale not saying goodbye to Katniss whom he loved dearly? Not ringing true.  Peeta yes was mental for most of the novel but she had a real chance to develop his emergence from being \\"hijacked\\" in a believable way and she did not.  As everyone has harped on - the final decision of Peeta with Katniss was awkward. I think Collins felt the reader would be comfortable with a quick wrap up. Maybe she felt we (like her?) knew it was Peeta all along. I think I did personally but I still would have appreciated a more moving conclusion to the romance because the relationship they had was a major draw for me in the novel as it was really developed so realistically and lovingly in the first two.    There was an awful lot of killing but it was a novel about war. So, I'm ok with that even though it was graphic. Just like at the end of Harry Potter - some significant characters were killed off quickly andwith no real reflection on the loss. As the reader you take it to heart but the writer perhaps doesn't understand how attached we are and like with real people - want the dead honored. That was not done and is a shame.     Katniss's mother faded into the background. Katniss's devotion to her district and the people from it was not there. She didn't even realize her old Hob friends were at 13 which seemed odd to me b/c she seemed like a loving community minded girl in the first two books since she provided food for many in the District and her mother provided medial attention. So it seems odd she would turn her back on \\"old friends.\\"    In the end there is not real shape for what the post-Snow post-Coin world will be like. Katniss whom you might have expected to become a leader in the new world (right? she's a leader...she's the Mockingjay!) disappears into a catatonic state for many months hiding in District 12 while Haymitch drinks himself into a stupor again.  So it feels a bit disjointed. I guess based on her character I would have expected her to take a role in forming/advising the new government and Haymitch, Peeta and Gale to all have roles as well.    Ah well. Bittersweet ending!
0767903862|5.0|This travelogue was filled with not only anecdotes from the author's trips around the continent/country, but also glimpses into its little known history and a plethora of other interesting facts. I learned a lot - and I have been to Australia before! Bryson's writing felt honest and completely authentic. I imagine that if you were to bump into him at a party, these are the same stories that he would share. I really enjoyed reading this and I am looking forward to reading more of his work!<br />He brought up the couple who were lost at sea quite a few times throughout the book, and I wonder if this had anything to do with that movie _Open Water_ being made. Bryson certainly seemed fixated by their mystery, and while the movie was not great, it was worth seeing once.<br />The real highlight of the book, to me, was Bryson's trip through Tennyson Park... I had hoped to hear about some of the dogs of Australia, but after that escapade, I understood why this wasn't included in the book.
0671775812|5.0|Summer reading for my 15yo didn't want to pay for a \\"new\\" book.  This came quick and was in wonderful shape! Exactly what we needed.
0439023513|5.0|There seems to be mixed reviews on the book. While, generally, they're mostly positive, many people feel the ending was too painful, too real. They feel the characters lost their compassion, and somehow went awry. They wanted it to be happier.    But a series about a country where its main form of entertainment is a battle royale will not have a happy ending. Katniss will not choose one guy, beat President Snow, and live happily ever after. There will be consequences. Lives will be lost. People will be hurt. Yes, painful, but real.    A.R. Bovey's review quoted a character from the miniseries \\"Band of Brothers\\" by stating \\"The only hope you have is to accept the fact that you're already dead. The sooner you accept that, the sooner you'll be able to function as a soldier is supposed to function: without mercy, without compassion, without remorse. All war depends upon it.\\" And that, essentially, is what the last book is about. Katniss has been forced through hell. Twice at this point. She knows what it's like to lose people she loves. She has killed, she's been torn away from home, she has barely survived numerous times. By the beginning of Mockingjay, she's not living anymore - she's surviving. And she's being forced through more.    And that's why I find Gale's quote about who she'll choose so fitting. \\"Katniss will pick whoever she thinks she can't survive without.\\" It's not heartless - it's true. And it's something that turns from \\"thinks\\" to \\"knows.\\"    With that, it's NOT about who she'll choose - Gale or Peeta. The series never was. Sure, it was the backstory, the romance that kept readers wanting more, but that never was the main plot. And as broken and lost as she is in this book, she just can't choose. (Yet, as readers do know, she does in the end. But that's not the point.)    The book is about war. About how hard it is, and how much people go through during and after it. The consequences. The reprocussions. The choices they have to make - the choices they're forced to make. Who to go back for, who to leave behind. Who to ultimately trust. Because, when fighting and killing, who really is right?    Yet, Katniss still has some of her old self around. Seen when she risks her life to help in districts 2 and 8, or when she makes a gift for Johanna, or pushes the hair out of Peeta's face - she's still there. She's still compassionate, but she's lost so much and seen so much in the process that it's easy for her to just slip into the void she's getting used to - hiding in closets and avoiding people. She can't get her life back.    Everything about the end was shocking, and I think that's what made it so good, and so painful. I was drained in the end, completely emotionally exhausted from the roller coaster of a book. But that's what it was supposed to feel like, I think. It was supposed to take you through every emotion, every feeling Katniss went through. So by the end there's more truth than comfort in Plutarch's words: \\"Collective thinking is usually short-lived. We're fickle, stupid beings with poor memories and a great gift for self-destruction. Although who knows? Maybe this will be it...\\"    No one is whole after its over. There's no getting your life back. There's just pushing on, surviving. There will always be those moments where, like Peeta, you'll have to hold onto the back of the chair just to make it out of the flashback. But you keep going because you find something - or someone - else to hold onto. And that's what Katniss does in the end, which, to me, is the ultimate test of strength. And there's so much beauty in it.    Truly, I wish more books were written like this. Honest. Painful. Wonderful.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|YA books, especially the dystopia ones, are generally interesting to read. This one tops them all. I think I like it even more than The Giver. It's fast paced enough to keep even the biggest non-reader interested, and packed full of meaning. It's horrifying in a completely fascinating way. This book crosses all sorts of genre boundaries. Don't let the review talking about reality tv put you off. It's much more complex and interesting than that!
0807014273|3.0|I read this book when I was in a very tough place based on the recommendations of a surgeon who unlike many surgeons was interested in my emotional well-being as well.  I was hit by a semi-truck while riding my bicycle and spent months in a very difficult place.  This book provided some solace although my situation was not nearly as bad as that suffered by the author and the other victims of the holocaust.  The author attempts a very difficult task, namely to develop tools for people to find meaning in some unimaginably painful situations.  Situations where finding the power to cope and find meaning seem to be pointless.  The author describes how he found the emotional strength to survive the concentration camps and come out to be a man who is not broken by circumstances.  I couldn't relate to all of his advice but I will remember one thing that the author advised.  When in an unbelievably dire and hopeless situation and all other meaning is lost, you can find meaning in suffering and dying with dignity.  When all bets are off, you shouldn't lose your humanity.
1439181780|5.0|This is a good follow up to the Secret. The base of the book is the same but there is more detail on the importance of feeling good and that Love is the key. I highly recommend this book.
0679735909|5.0|This book is a tour-de-force that weaves historical insights in to a romance, while containing some poetry that could stand along in a separate book.  This poetry is not included as chapter introduction fodder, but is written by the characters themselves and thus provides insights in to the characters with the elegance and expansiveness of poetry.  This unique literary device is a small example of the techniques with which the author expands the storytelling power of prose.  I read this book based upon a tangential quote from the author referenced in the book, The Blank Slate by the author Stephen Pinker.  The quote intrigued me enough to pick up this book although romantic fiction and to be honest poetry isn't usually up my alley.  I tend to be a more left-brained type.  But this book is a treat for book-lovers of all types.  A beautifully written and tragic narrative that reveals the author to be a person of many interest and talents and a capability to write about them all.  An absolutely excellent book.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I had rather low expectations of this miniseries, and was only going to watch the first few minutes to see if I liked it enough to watch the rest.  Hours later, at one in the morning, I had somehow managed to watch the entire series!    This is the best miniseries I have seen on the small screen.  The production values are top notch and feels close to the quality of a feature film.  The cinematography is beautiful at times (e.g., the iconic scene where John Thornton is walking swiftly thru his mill with bits of cotton in the air resembling snow) the sets are wonderful, and the score is haunting.  It's too bad the BBC isn't selling it.    The pacing of the plot leaves no areas where you're confused about the direction or point of certain scenes.   The acting is wonderful and really tugs at you heart strings.  Cusak's proud mother role steals any scene she is in, and Richard Armitage gives a performance that will be remembered along side Colin Firth's Darcy.    The only thing I wish is that we in the States were getting the European version of the DVD.  The version released for Europe is widescreen, while state-side, we have to settle for the typical TV 4:3 aspect ratio.

B000U618C8|5.0|i am very particular about what i listen to depending on how i feel--it could be anything from led zeppelin to african music to sonic youth.  this album stands out as the only album i can listen to daily without feeling tired of it. great for driving, eating a romantic dinner, hanging out with friends, cleaning the house, etc., etc. it NEVER gets old to me. i also saw jose gonzalez play the music in  concert in brooklyn a few years ago so that adds a lot of meaning for me.     i read the review by the person who had just listened to it for the first time and said they didn't dig it.  how can you write a reliable review about an album after the first listen?  in my opinion, the best stuff always grows on you. this album is textured and gorgeous. a 10 out of 10 from me.
1601251831|5.0|This book is really a must if you want to DM a group and you are not keen on using pre-made material. The art is astonishing, the paper quality is very good and the bindings are very well-made. The layout itself covers everything in order to use one of the many monsters inside and, for the first time, clear and simple instructions to create or modify one. Descriptions are good, including info on the monster's habitat or customs (as it used to be in TSR products). All in all, it is a great product, and I am looking forward to getting the next one. Paizo is doing a great job with his Pathfinder Roleplaying Game line.
1595825045|5.0|This is a beautiful well put together art book that not only displays the pre-production art from the series but also tells the story of how it all came together through each season.  I truly was inspired by this book I only wish it was twice as long!
1932100660|5.0|A couple of years ago I had an emergency appendectomy.  Two months ago, I had my gallbladder taken out.  My doctor put me on an all plant based diet and told me to never eat red meat again if I could help it.  I realized I have had digestive issues my entire life and now I feel so much better.  I have not become totally vegan as I cannot bring myself to give up dairy entirely.  However, as a certified junk food junkie who ate chocolate for breakfast lunch and dinner since her teens, I crave fresh cut up cucumbers and tomatoes over anything else I could have in the fridge.  I eat spinach like I've never had it before and I am learning to \\"taste\\" other fruits and vegetables and give them a chance.  I have not eaten anything good for me in many years and now after two months, my digestive system is wonderful.  I don't wake up bloated and nauseated and I don't hurt after every meal.  You can eat all you want all day long and never be hungry and as long as it is primarily or wholly plant based, you will feel and act younger.  I still eat chocolate but I strive to make it dark chocolate and I don't eat it in the quantities I did before.  I have cut a lot of dairy out of my life but I don't see myself being able to cut it entirely out.  I did switch from whole to skim milk and I now cook with soy milk.
B0035J6TAI|2.0|I am a fan of Peter Gabriel so bought the special edition, which has 4 additional songs.  I was quite disappointed in this work.  His renditions are dreary and depressing and not in an interesting way either.  I really expected a much better interpretation of these songs.  I highly recommend trying to listen to this online before you buy it.  Had I done so, I wouldn't have bought it.
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|Brilliant album , together with \\"Nil recurring\\" - one of My top PT albums , another is Steven Wilson's \\" Insurgentes\\" - but for those who have no idea what kind of music this is - listen to the previews or utube first!!!!!! It is not like anything else and it actually requires listening!!! So do not get into this - everybody gave 5* so I will get it! It is NOT FOR EVERYONE!!! Porcupine Tree and Steven Wilson are not going in their old foot steps but getting on new path every time- it may be not easily accepted by everyone,but it is a great path and direction the musicians are taking - so much more complex and heavier ! I am getting surprised and amazed every time !!!
B002S0OBMS|4.0|My partner and I attended the show at the Adelphi Theatre on Friday 27 August.  Bottom line:  not the impact of the POTO but very good in it's own way.  I think the music will grow on us once we get the CD and listen again.  Now I wish we had purchased the disc first. We liked all of the music with the exception of \\"The Beauty Underneath.\\" It has a rock/rap sound and beat totally out of sync with the time period of the action.  What was ALW thinking?  As with other of his works the entire production is almost an operetta and the words really move the story along.  The principle singers are extremely good as you can note from various UTube samples available.  People who are ALW fans will hear a little bit of POTO, Sunset Boulevard, and The Woman in White - which is not a complaint on my part.  The performance was nearly sold-out and the audience really seemed to get into and enjoy the show...at least as much as we did.  About 3/4 delivered a standing ovation.  I hope the show goes on for a long time, but we doubt it will have the following of the original.
B003L77TZI|2.0|Really wanted to like this as I loved the 2 radio singles.  I should just learn my lesson that usually the singles are the only good songs on a pop album.  Most of the songs sounded like cheesy metaphors.  And really \\"if it's not like the movies\\"?  Real life and love is not like the movies.  What a disappointing message.
B003HARV3Y|2.0|I read the Percy Jackson series twice, once before viewing the DVD and once after. I had been trying to encourage my 13 year old son to read the series, but he only did so after seeing the DVD. So, if nothing else, the movie encouraged my son to read! For everyone who liked the movie, I highly recommend that you read the series! The written storyline is so much better!    We never saw the Lightening Thief movie in the theater, only the DVD. My son liked the movie. The actors were very good and so were the special effects. Unfortunately,the movie deviated from the storyline to the point that the major reason for any sequel was lost. I was very disappointed in the DVD storyline; so much so, that I gave the DVD away and will not keep it in our DVD library.    SPOILER ALERT, I'm now stating some of the differences and why I was disappointed. There were a lot of minor differences that can be attributed to poetic license.  One example is that the characters were all in their late teens in the movie, whereas in the first book Percy and Annabeth were only 12. Another example is that Percy didn't know that he was a demigod at first. The latter doesn't detract from the series; but the former does, because of the prophecy. The reason for Percy not knowing his dad was attributed to Zeus' jealousy of his brother Poseidon. Hades was portrayed as a maniacal power grabber, where in the book he is not so evil. The characters of Ares and Clarise were omitted. Some of their attributes were given to Annabeth and Luke respectively. The more substantial omissions and changes detract too much from the storyline of the book - let alone the series. There was no mention of the prophecy of a child of the \\"big three\\". There was only superficial mention of Kronos in the museum scene. Luke was portrayed as the bad guy behind everything, instead of as a pawn for Kronos. Percy, Annabeth and Grover go after the lightening bolt in order to try and rescue Percy's Mom without permission, instead of with permission because of a quest. Minor details: the \\"Pearls\\" were a gift from Percy's Dad, not items that they needed to find (although it was done well in the movie); Percy wouldn't wear the flying shoes because of Zeus, so Grover wore them - in the movie he not only wears them, Percy battles Luke with them on; the St. Louis Arch part of the book was omitted; the \\"Parthenon\\" replica in Tennessee was not in the book; Luke tries to kill Percy at the end of the book and then disappears.    With the omission of Kronos and the prophecy from the storyline of the DVD, I don't see how they can hope to create a series of movies.  I for one, will not go to see them - they can only be made by deviating even further from the written series.  It is a crying shame, with the actors, directors, producers and author involved, it should have been a real triumph; instead, it was a farce.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I saw this movie four times now and laughed and loved it more each time.Gru tries so hard to be a super-villian but that all goes downhill when three of the most adorable orphan girls show up and steal his heart.With a cute plot,funny,lovable characters and good story this movie gets five stars from me.Better then Toy Story 3 and a surprisingly great job from Universal Studios,I highly recomend this movie,guarenteed to make you laugh from start to finish!
0812550757|2.0|This book was a HUGE let down for me.  I read, and thoroughly enjoyed Ender's Game, Ender in Exile, and Ender's Shadow.  This is the first book in the Ender series I've read that I really struggled to even finish.  Boring as hell.  So much time spent on this alien race, trying to figure out their mating habits, then some stuff about some portugese catholics and how their religious beliefs are very much against the idea of a Speaker for the Dead....which by the way was a fact that was repeated MANY times...  On top of the absolutely boring as hell plot, at no point did I find a reason to care much for the any of the characters involved.      I'm continuing on and reading more of the Ender series, since 3 out of 4 that I've read were 4 & 5 star books.  That being said, I have no idea how this book got so many five star reviews.  Usually I agree with the masses on book reviews, but this time I guess I'm swimming upstream because this book sucked.      BORING!!!!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Since I am a working mom, my living room is my gym and I own a lot of workout DVD's.  This one is my favorite one because I feel I can get a great, full-body workout in a very short amount of time.    There are 3 different workouts on this DVD, all about 25 min. each.  They progress from \\"easy\\" to \\"difficult.\\"  If you have never worked out with Jillian before, I suggest you watch each workout before actually doing it.  She does not provide much instruction, so make sure you are comfortable with each move before doing it.  She does provide a model to follow for easier and more difficult versions of each exercise.    I have owned this DVD for over a year and it helped me to get back in shape after my first baby and I'm using it now after having my second baby.  I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who wants a great workout and for someone looking to get into better shape.
B002RSDW80|3.0|There really isn't much to add in the 350th Amazon review of \\"Julie & Julia,\\" so I'll limit myself to one observation.<br /><br />Not long after \\"Julie & Julia\\" was released, another film hit a few screens with, alas, no appreciable effect.  It was \\"Me and Orson Welles.\\"  In both films a much larger than life character was brilliantly portrayed by a character actor.  In both films, half the screentime was devoted to a younger nonentity.  Has the appreciation of the movie-going public held by Hollywood's movers and shakers fallen so low that they believe that big characters and big acting can only be approached through the intermediation of on-screen nobodies?<br /><br />Get the DVD.  Enjoy Streep and Tucci.  Sleep through the agita and tsouris of Whats'ername playing Julie.  Leave the TV set and get yourself a snack, preferably something from Julia Child's book, whenever that abominable, knuckle-dragging, talks-with-his-mouth-full, clod married to Julie befouls the screen.<br /><br />Five stars for the Julia part of the film.  Zero stars for the Julie part.  Two-and-one-half stars overall; call it three.<br /><br />LEC/AmUS/08-10
0439023513|3.0|I intentionally waited five days after I finished Mockingjay before writing my review, thinking this would give me time to process my thoughts and emerge from the cloud of doom that began smothering me about one chapter in and didn't let up again, ever.<br /><br />Well, five days out, the cloud is gone. In its place? Numbness. Actually, numbness might be giving it too much credit. I think apathy might be more accurate. When I finish a really great book, like the first two in the Hunger Games series, or the 7th Harry Potter book, I don't want to read anything else for awhile. My thoughts and emotions are too tied up with the book I just finished -- I either want to reread it again immediately, or just meditate on it for awhile. Reading something new right away is unthinkable.<br /><br />**SPOILERS***<br /><br />Not so with MJ. My interest in MJ faded before I even finished the book. Suzanne Collins systematically beat out of me every last smidgeon of emotion or investment in the story. I was so drained by the end, I really did not even care who Katniss wound up with. I could vaguely remember being pro-Peeta at the end of Catching Fire. But Peeta is unrecognizable in this book; he's brainwashed into a monster. Until, of course, that cheesy epilogue where he is magically cured (aside from those sporadic bouts of Having To Grip The Chair).<br /><br />Yes, I thought the epilogue was cheesy. The cute little domestic life Peeta and Katniss have finally arrived at, and the two paragraphs or whatever it is that Suzanne bothers to describe it in, seemed forced and insincere. It's like throwing a dog a bone after you beat it within an inch of its life. (Dear Reader, you are the dog.)<br /><br />***END SPOILERS***<br /><br />I think I liked Katniss in the first two books, but Mockingjay made me forget why. Her character is all over the place. This may well have been intentional on the author's part--another statement, I suppose, about the horrors of war, etc--but it made for very tedious reading at times. Katniss would spend paragraphs justifying every decision she made. I had a hard time following her reasoning, but suddenly she would arrive at a conclusion like, \\"Therefore, I have to be the Mockingjay!\\" or \\"I vote yes!\\"--which she seemed to be indicating was, of course, the only possible conclusion she could have ever reached. Rather than sit back and try to follow her reasoning, I would sigh and turn the page, hopeful that it would all be over soon and I could just go to bed.<br /><br />For me, it was that feeling of \\"when will this all be over, please let it be soon\\" that was the ultimate failure of the book. When I am reading a really great book, I never want it to end. With Harry Potter, I would get increasingly angsty as the page numbers stacked up, knowing that it would be over all too soon. With Mockingjay, I just wanted it to stop. I grieved and grieved and grieved - until, about 50% in, I became basically desensitized.<br /><br />Now, I know there are plenty of professional literary critics out there who, if they were to read this, would make some sneering comments about how literature's not just meant to amuse and please you, little girl. To which I would reply: get over yourself, buttmunch. If I wanted to feel hopeless and numb all the time, I'd watch the news more, or I'd read contemporary adult \\"literary fiction.\\" I can handle some darkness, but it needs to be tempered with hope.<br /><br />3/5 stars (because it's still well written and I &lt;3 FINNICK!!)nd paragraphs justifying every decision she made.

Look, despite what all the \\"gurus\\" say, the rest of the world, in other words, the \\"real world\\" still doesn't get social media and how it can dramatically change their business for the better.

0439023513|5.0|I originally wrote this review in my Devo journal, so some of the thoughts might seem a little scrambled. But I cover most of the points that stood out to me the most. It's a bit lengthy, but most of it was premeditated, and I needed to stop talking to myself.     Let me start out by saying I really liked this book. It was a thrilling and terrifying ending to this fantastic series. The other two books I would give 5 out of 5 stars because I thought they were better (Mockingjay I gave 4.5/5, I rounded up). But I still like Mockingjay a lot.      Two things stand out to me the most about it. The first is the fact that the tone and mood of this book was entirely and undeniably depressing. Completely apart from Finnick and Prim's deaths (which do contribute to the sad feel), Katniss's attitude throughout is always occupied with worries about her next action and the situations with Peeta and Gale. She felt sorry for herself a lot, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, I mean anyone in her place would feel that way. Also Katniss and Gale's relationship is strained, and they didn't share many happy moments together.     The second thing that really made an impact on me is the lack of closure about characters at the end of the book. We got a couple sentences on the whereabouts of Gale, Katniss's mother, and Annie, but what's happened to Johanna ? Was Haymitch a big part of Katniss and Peeta's life ? Who, if anyone, did Gale marry and start a family with ? Did Annie raise her son successfully Finnick ? Did Katniss's prep team ever see anything beautiful again ? I mean, I just felt so uncomplete. And I'm not saying this is a flaw to the novel. Maybe Ms. Collins wanted to leave us with a sense of mystery to have us use our own imaginations, or maybe this is how Katniss felt (Doubt it, though) ? I just want to know if Katniss ever saw Gale again. Also if the reason Katniss and Gale didn't end up together was that it was HIS bomb that killed Prim. I was really surprised when Katniss and Peeta ended up together. We got a bit of closure about them, but not enough to settle my mind. I would have liked to know her children's names.     In this book a lot of people die, but the one that really shocked the crap out of me was Prim's. Because SHE is the reason, not so much the cause, of why this revolution started. It was Katniss's love for her sister that made uprisings begin. I really felt Katniss's pain when Prim died, and I was surprised she could even continue living. It took two reads of the book to figure out it was Gale and Beetee's bomb that killed Prim. I think this is the reason that Katniss and Gale didn't end up together. Every time Katniss looked at Gale, she would think of Prim, and that is enough to mentally destroy anyone.     Johanna is another person I would have liked to know what happened to because she grew to be one of my favorite characters in this book. She became friends with Katniss, when most of her friends were gone. Johanna had lost everyone she loved, but in the midst of all that she found Katniss, someone to love.     When I first read the big scene of the crew running around the tunnels of the capital, I got freaked out. Mostly because of the mutts that chase them throughout the tunnels, and eventually end Finnick's life. Their descriptions were terrifying: white scaly creatures resembling humans, but in lizard form. The hissing they made while tracking down Katniss. Do not read this part in a dark room whilst home alone. If I was younger, I would have gotten nightmares.      Overall I loved this book a great deal. After I finished it the first time, I couldn't stop thinking about it, and I had to read it again. Despite the lack of closure and the sad nature of this book, Ms. Collins has really proved to be an amazing storyteller with a titanic imagination, almost JK Rowling-like. The fact that any normal person can come up with this intricate world is beyond me. One the whole, well done, Ms. Collins, well done.

B0015DROBO|5.0|OK....I bought the book and found myself strangely reluctant to read it.  Not sure why.  Pobably because of all the hype surrounding the book.  Once I started the book, I understood why I had reluctance, the first few chapters were slow, slow, slow.  I wasn't sure if I would be able to finish. But once you got past all of the financial background information, it was great.  As the story toggled back and forth between characters, you couldn't wait to see what the others were up to.  I ended up loving the book.  Can't wait to read the next one.  Remember, give yourslf time to get though some wordy background and you will really enjoy it!!
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This is a remarkable movie, and it will change the way you eat.  It puts pictures to the words of some of the most important books books on the subject, such as Omnivore's Dilemma, Fast Food Nation, etc. and the imagery is very moving.  Amazing what is hidden from the view of the public.
B002AT4K9G|3.0|This one wasn't bad for being 4th in the franchise.  However, this one should have at least been 2nd or 3rd.  It was good to see many of the originals again.
0739383728|2.0|This review pertains to the audio book.  I was looking forward to this book as read some great reviews, but the narrator made listening difficult.  At times overly dramatic and at times unconvincing, I couldn't even get through the first disc.
B003TJ4YU6|5.0|Since this DVD set isn't out yet - and I can't possibly have seen it - this \\"review\\" is based on things I have heard from some reliable Beatles sources.    This release will be pretty similar to the SOFA Home Entertainment release from 2003, with the addition of some 13 additional minutes of footage. This additional content will consist of a brief London interview with The Beatles by Sullivan which apparently has not been seen since the day it aired (May 24, 1964); a 1966 b&w commercial for Beatles dolls introduced by Sullivan in color; and the host reading a 1967 telegram from The Beatles congratulating him on the renaming of the studio to \\"The Ed Sullivan Theater.\\"    Also, the Miami, FL show is being refurbished as the original taping (which was done in a hotel and not in a TV studio) was pretty weak.    It's up to you to decide if this is worth it or not (if you already have the previous SOFA release). I probably will not bother.
B003L77TZI|5.0|Fantastic album but I still prefer One Of The Boys. I loved all the tracks in this record as they are quite catchy and entertaining but in my opinion E.T should have been the lead single from this album or atleast a potential one. In conclusion it was a fantastic listening experience and very enjoyable.
B001F12J0C|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE these movies!!!  Matt Damon is awesome as Jason Bourne.  Having all three movies to watch in sequence is the only way to go.  The last one STILL leaves the opportunity for a 4th one.  Although I've read where Matt Damon isn't interested in filming another in the Bourne series, I am eternally optimistic that he will change his mind.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|this was a great, fantanstic way to end the series. loved it, especially the ending. lots of twists that were unpredictable.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|It took me a few episodes to really get into this show, but now I can't get enough!  The more I watch, the more I laugh and appreciate the small details that make this show so funny.  Love it!
B0035J6TAI|5.0|Peter Gabriel doesn't release music very often, but when he does it's usually the greatest thing anyone has ever heard.  This is definitely true with his 2010 offering, \\"Scratch My Back\\".  Covering such artists as Regina Spektor, Arcade Fire and Radiohead, Peter Gabriel has thrown out all of the usual rock instruments and limited the arrangements to mostly strings, piano and vocal.  Such an arrangement elevates several already brilliant songs to a higher level, and it takes other songs (such as Paul Simon's \\"Boy In The Bubble\\") that were virtually unlistenable when performed by the original artists and completely transforms them into a vulnerable, naked and emotional stroke of unparalleled genius.  You need to get this album.  Pronto.  Don't wait.  Act now.
B000XA5K4I|5.0|Pre-requisite to watching this movie: put aside science/physics/commonsense aside. This movie, from start to end, is just crazy senseless action. This is a guy's movie.

B0000TLA9G|5.0|Another fantastic album by Guns n Roses. I'm an old geezer that thrives not only  on '60's rock but also truly appreciates groups like this one.    Glad they included Sweet Child of Mine, one of my favorites.

B0026SCMNM|2.0|i was so excited to find a new irish author, after a search through the kindle contemporary fiction section.  though aggravating at times, i did get engrossed in this story.  because i was reading it on my kindle vs a physical book, i didn't realize i had come to the end of the book.  i kept hitting &#34;next page&#34;, thinking my kindle had malfunctioned, but no, the story abruptly ended with absolutely no closure.  i absolutely hated the ending to the point of yelling internally, &#34;that's it?&#34;   i am completely disappointed.  so much for my belief that i found a great new irish author.  i will not read another of toibin's books.  forgive me for not capitalizing the beginning of sentences.....couldn't figure out how to do it on the kindle.

B00284BNKC|5.0|I dont really know how to review this movie. It's weird but good.  No purpose in the story, just the journey... Sit back and enjoy the ride.
0439023513|3.0|I wasn't disappointed, per se, but I wasn't enthralled either.  There was nothing about this book that grabbed me and wouldn't let go.  Often, I was flat out bored, and sometime about the mid-point of the story, Collins started writing random fragment sentences.  They were so jarring to me.<br /><br />No idea if this is a spoiler or not, but I am proceeding with extreme caution:<br /><br />The Hunger Games, without the games?  Just not the same.  I knew there was no possibility of games, but I didn't realize how much it would change the dynamic of the story and virtually remove all the excitement from it.<br /><br />Bella, I mean, Katniss wasn't really herself.  And how many near-death-experiences was that?  She spent most of the book in the hospital.<br /><br />Speaking of death, Collins hasn't been shy about killing off characters, but this seemed like overkill (ha!).  And GRAPHIC.  Holy cow!  Extremely violent.  Unnecessarily so.<br /><br />End what probably wasn't at all a spoiler<br /><br />So, I don't know.  It sounds like I disliked the book, and I didn't.  But it holds none of the allure of the first two, and I personally didn't find it a particularly satisfying ending to what was a great series.  I know that the final outcome was, in a sense, pre-determined, but I think there could have been a better way to get there.  Collins got a little wrapped up in finding creative ways for people to die.  For the age group this is intended for, I found it too much, too harsh and frankly, too sad.
B003L16FAE|5.0|One of my favourite movies growing up. Awesome video and audio. Awesome action. Very cool behind the scenes, interviews, etc. Must buy for any action, Arnie, science fiction, monster movie fan.
B0014E9188|5.0|For those of us with the misfortune of being unable to see this prolific band in concert (or if so, only rarely), this dvd is the next best thing. The band plays just as tight live as in the studio, and the \\"concert experience\\" is quite rewarding audiovisually. For fans of PT this purchase is a no-brainer. For those new to this phenomenal music, I highly recommend it. The music itself is difficult to categorize, and to do so would only be a disservice to their musicianship and the scope of their sound. You really have to see/hear this band to appreciate them.
B001U0HAZM|5.0|If you want to watch a movie with superb acting, get this. Awesome video and audio quality.

B003OF3R0S|5.0|Amazing album, melodic tunes, really catchy, a great tribute to the Rev, and in my opinion the best Avenged album so far, totally worth the money.
B0029LHW68|4.0|I bought this album when it was first released last year, but I haven't thought to review it until now. Before I begin, it should be known that I'm not your \\"average\\" 30 Seconds To Mars fan, whatever that may be. I'm not into bands like My Chemical Romance or AFI, or anything else that could be considered emo. But there's something different about this band. They have a great talent for writing intelligent lyrics, creating unusual musical structures, while blending hard rock and new-wave rock with electronics. I thoroughly enjoyed both of the band's other albums, so here's my review on this one.<br /><br />The album begins with Escape, which is really just an intro for the whole album. The first real song is Night Of The Hunter, a very electronic 80's sounding tune, but not in a cheesy way. Jared Leto's vocals sound a bit like Bono on this track. Kings And Queens is the big single on this album that you've probably heard by now if you're reading this. This song (much like the rest of the album) didn't do much for me the first time I heard it, but I seemed to enjoy it more with every listen and now I think it's a phenomenal track. The album's title track is the latest single, a somewhat happier sounding tune that I think is good but not one of the more memorable tracks. One of my favorites on here is Alibi, a very moving piano ballad with some light backing of guitar reminiscent of The Cure. Then there's Stranger In A Strange Land, a very cool electronic track. This song and Hurricane sound more like something from the band's first album. Other songs like Closer To The Edge and 100 Suns have an almost Christian rock vibe to the melodies, just in the sense that they're very uplifting songs with sing-along choruses. This whole album actually seems \\"happier\\" and more positive than their previous efforts, but everything that makes the band unique is still intact. My only complaint about this album is all the singing from the crowd that was recorded by their fans at a concert. It's cool that they wanted to put their fans on the album, but when every single song has all these people (mostly female) singing along, it gets kind of annoying. Other than that, it's a solid effort by the band and I'll continue to keep my eye on them!'s cool that they wanted to put their fans on the album, but when every single song has all these people (mostly female) singing along, it gets kind of annoying.

B000JGQRPC|4.0|Ms. Fielding did a fantastic job of keeping things real for Bridget. Her descriptions of the characters help to make things come even more alive and make it seem like you are right there in the book. The book is well written whether in journal or story form.<br /><br />Bridget is very real and most of the time not too over the top. She has to rely on her friends since her family has their own struggles. The ones that are the most close are Tom, Shazz, and Jude. They keep her uplifted through all the things she experiences in the book.<br /><br />I liked this book over all and never really saw a connection to Pride and Prejudice. There were a few mentions of the movie with Colin Firth. It's a quirky book if you can get past all the drama. By the end, it was wrapped up neatly and I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. I may just check out the next book in the series.
B003INBOEC|5.0|Like most guys I've seen a lot of martial arts movies and have seen a lot of things on those movies that have caught my attention.  I've wanted to try learning kung fu before, but lost interest with not really having the time to pursuit it.  This movie however really resparked my interest in wanting to learn Kung Fu.  The fights in this movie are some of the best I've ever seen and it's a real tribute to grandmaster of Wing Chun Yip Man.  This is definately Donnie Yen's best work to date.  A must have for Donnie Yen fans as well as any martial arts movie fan.
0307454541|3.0|I purchased this book because someone very close to me told me that it was an excellent read. She couldn't put it down. However, this book failed to draw me in. The beginning was interesting, but it took forever for the author to get to the point of the story. If the main character becomes irritated with how long it takes for his employer to get to the point of why he hired him, then wouldn't the reader feel the same?  I've had it for a couple of months, and I still haven't finished it.<br />The title has been the best thing about the whole story.
0439023513|5.0|Listen, all I have to say is that was a GREAT ending to a GREAT trilogy. I'm just so sad it's over; I don't even know what to do with myself right now... And that last chapter? I was in my room literally crying as I read certain parts.

B003AO1SVS|2.0|I've been waiting for the reinvention for sometime, and knew he was not the blues purist he maintained. Now we get the blues heavy funk of T-Rex or James Blood Ulmer. Gone, however you might feel, are Dan Auerbach's solo wankings. It's heavy handed production which cannot mask limited vocal posturing. If your like me, you still long to see Hound Dog Taylor live.<br /><br />P.S. If the entire album was, \\"too afraid to love you,\\" it might suggest a career change. Auerbach would have made a great sideman.
B003CR9BYE|5.0|This is a great CD and the sound is just fine. It's one of my favorite CD's. I have several Carlos Jobim CDs as well as a few Frank CDs and it's nice to have this one. I'm no sound engineer but I have never even noticed any hint of a problem with the sound. Nada. My advice: I highly recommend not paying attention to the negative reviews and buying this CD today. You won't be disappointed... Btw, there is an expensive... DVD with Frank and Carlos Jobim singing a few of these songs together on stage. I own it. They're both on stools while Carlos accompanies w/ guitar. It very good to watch but too brief. They do a medley from their album . I forget how long, but it's maybe 10 minutes and the DVD also has solo Frank and also Ella Fitzgerald. In total the DVD is about 50+ minutes long. I just wish more was w/ Carlos...I think Blockbuster has it for rent online.
0156027321|1.0|My book never came TO ME. According to Amazon's tracking feature some person signed for my package on a day NO-ONE WAS EVEN HOME AT MY HOUSE. I emailed the company and did not receive any kind of reply. The service is absolutely terrible!
0439023513|5.0|Wow. I mean, just...wow. This book spoke to me. I would strongly suggest this series if you're looking for a new one.    At first, I didn't like the ending because (spoilers ahead!) Katniss just sat around and moped for the last few chapters. But I loved the epilogue; I always strongly supported the Peeta and Katniss couple. Although, I do wish they had mentioned the kids names...I think some good ones would be Elizabeth and Thomas. But that's just me ;)    It is kind of hard to get into, considering what a cliffhanger they left us with on Catching Fire, and I think they overdid it with Katniss getting hurt so much. I mean, really. Every time she got hurt, they said she was \\"Mentally Disoriented\\" or something related to that. And the publicity stunt with Peeta? They should've just told everyone before she shot the arrow at President Coin.    Also, what was up with President Snow? Was he a vampire or something? I guess we'll never know...    All in all, the best book I've ever read. Better than twilight and harry potter, even :) And coming from me, that's saying something!
B0025KVLT2|5.0|If ever there was a record that could have planted the seeds to the termination process of the Brill Building staff, this had to be the one. The Beatles became the titans of songwriting and entered new terrain with edgy songs that focused on the adult perspective. They took Dylan's cue and reflected their expanding consciousness with a lyrical freedom to be experienced by the listener. And this deeper sense of discovery generated its concept. They departed from their musical past and now lush acoustic instrumentation was predominant and the electric guitars were more subdued-sounding.<br /><br />Rhythmic shifts still abounded but now there was a fullness of harmonies in which they had mastered their own style rather than show mere influence from their fifties rock and roll heroes. This was perhaps best evidenced on John's first spiritual vision, \\"The Word\\" and on George's unromantic \\"Think For Yourself\\", both undervalued classics. Paul's \\"I'm Looking Through You\\" was a surprisingly caustic view at romance fitting neatly into one of his strongest melodies. Even his \\"Michelle\\" displayed a bit of tension in its language barrier. But \\"Run For Your Life\\" was sheer torment.<br /><br />The irreducible core of this record surrounded three of John's tracks which fused his poetry of actual experience into a folk-rock framework. \\"In My Life\\" was a fond observation of those he knew from his past but whose relevance had slighty been diminished in his present, climaxing with his sublime falsetto near the song's end. With \\"Norwegian Wood\\" he admitted, albeit cryptically, that any halo he might have worn, had long since fallen off his head. George's sitar added to the bizarre on this classic of infidelity and possible retaliation. And my personal favorite, \\"Girl\\", was the most profound dissection of facets in his personal life at that moment. Here he took a hard look into the state of his first marriage, fantasized of this \\"other\\" woman whose strength would rescue him and attempted to contend with his opposition to Christianity. His plaintive voice was the connective tissue to all these complexities he was enduring.<br /><br />This still stands as a quintessential landmark in the field of popular music. They had achieved compositional self-reliance with a unified vision of stretching their music, but starting here there would be a gradual change to their collective identity.<br /><br />P.S. Though I'm basing this on the U.K. configuration which is perfect, I actually have a soft spot for the U.S. version. It coheres seamlessly as contemporary folk-rock. I love \\"I've Just Seen A Face\\" as the opening cut and the false intro to \\"I'm Looking Through You\\". The sneak that I am, this is the reason I didn't reference any of the songs on the U.K. only edition. So I'll say this, the 12-string guitar and the harmonies are breathtaking on George's \\"If I Needed Someone\\" and John's \\"Nowhere Man\\".his opposition to Christianity.

0399156577|5.0|I loved this book.  It was just so easy and fun to read, I  hated putting it down.  I didn't find the parts about the dog training boring at all.  I love dogs, so I found the info about the dogs something extra to like about the book.
0307454541|4.0|Stieg Larsson's first novel has been a spectacular success as have the other two in the series. Although it takes a long time to set up its characters and plot, the book is very readable. I finished the nearly 600 page trade paperback version in less than a week. There are two interlocking plots. Journalist Mikael Blomkvist has just been convicted of libeling a ruthless businessman, Hans-Erik Wennerstrom. The disgraced journalist is hired by octogenarian Henrik Vanger, ostensibly to write a history of the Vanger family and its business interests, but actually to investigate the disappearance of Henrik's niece more than forty years earlier. As he investigates, Blomkvist, aided by young computer hacker, Lisbeth Salander, the title character who apparently has Asperger's syndrome or some other condition that makes it difficult to relate to others, discovers some horrible Vanger family secrets. The Vanger plot is compelling, making the novel worth reading. However, it is solved about 100 pages before the novel ends. The remainder is devoted to Blomkvist's revenge against the unscrupulous Wennerstrom, a story that is at best routine. And most of the characters are fairly one dimensional. As a result, I'd recommend the book, but only mildly.
B0000AUHPG|3.0|I purchased the Special Collectors Edition from Amazon several years back but only got around to finally watching it this evening.  (My wife was out with girl friends and I had some time to burn!).   As a huge fan of the three Eastwood \\"Man with No Name\\" movies, I'd seen this upon the original shorten theatrical release; way back when.  I didn't care for it much then and can only say a bit more these decades later.  \\"Artistically\\" it's a very good looking film and it's got a great cast but it is just so, so slow and rarely exciting in the action sequences.  I'm probably simply a low brow entertainment whore who values entertainment first and appreciates the \\"art\\" secondarily.  Over the years I've view \\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\\" probably 15 times but I'm reasonably certain this will be the last viewing of \\"Once Upon a Time in the West.\\"  Really over rated.
B002SQ364Q|5.0|First of all a \\"slow\\" film is not a bad thing. I tire of fast paced films that are like the empty calories you get from another over-sweet but useless soda drink.  There's clearly a lot more to this story than is presented but despite that I love the peaceful chaos leading to the event and the growth of the poor nebbish who triggered this social landslide. It was part protest of the war, a gathering of like-minded but diverse people and a musical event that changed music entertainment forever.  What really struck me was how even the smallest part played gave the sense that even this person, in this pivotal event, has an experience that could be successfully explored. Some complaints about wooden acting eludes me. The acting is sometimes stilted, stressed, but that's a wonderful reflection of how out of control this music fest became. After all, how would any small town and its residents react to half a million people showing up with only a week or so notice?  Demetri Martin was surprisingly well cast for this role. This poor guy has no idea what he's done and struggles appropriately with the newfound dissent of a lot of the townsfolk who hate what he's caused. His character Jacob also has to deal with the added stress the influx of thousands of happy freaks and music fans have on his town, his parents' business and the fallout triggered by the concert.  I particularly enjoyed the fact that being right there where it was all happening our hapless Jacob never manages to get close enough to see the actual concert. Like most of those in attendance all he can do is look into the distance at the pretty stage lights and listen to the music as it inundates like a wavering sea of sound (a great scene enhanced by way of some potent chemicals).  This is a brave film commemorating an incredible moment in American history and how one person brought it about as well as how it changed him. There's no deep meaning, not major issues resolved. There's change and there's acceptance, two fundamental aspects of personal revelation.  The cast was so well immersed in the period that while they all stand out, they are also contributing to the whole. Liev Schreiber as the cross dressing \\"Velma\\", Vilma (?) hotel security for Jacob and his parents is a treat. He's very effective as a sage and worldly man, like a social mentor to our sink or swim Jacob.  This is a film that's easy to view repeatedly.  I confess, being a young man when this occurred there's an easy affinity to these events especially since some great hippy/freak neighbors went to Woodstock. Even though they invited us along our father put his foot down. He was probably right, but still... based on what I've learned, I wish he'd relented.

I just couldn't relate.  I kept thinking I'd eventually start liking her as she started travelling or something, but I couldn't.  She just kept annoying me and I kept rolling my eyes.  Maybe I've seen tragedy and her life just isn't it.  Yes, pain is pain, but I wish she had some sense to be more thankful for what she had rather than having to search far and wide. . . .I guess it's memorable because I read it months ago and just the thought of that woman still makes me grit my teeth.

B00007KQA3|5.0|As the owner of the four adaptations of the Orwellian classic \\"1984\\" brought to the screen, this version is the second to the perfect adaptation of the 'Utopia Gone Sour' novel written by George Orwell.<br /><br />The first version, \\"1984\\" was produced in 1954 by the BBC for English television.  It is a fair version, bringing the novel to the light of the small screen.  It added a lot of details of conversation that the book had, although in the end, it was rather cheesy.<br /><br />The second version, \\"1984\\" was produced in 1956 in England.  This was the version a lot of us in High School saw at political assemblies, and it introduced us to Orwellian concepts.  In the earlier version, Big Brother was made to look like a heavyset mean bully.  In this version, Big Brother was made to look like  Jack Webb's \\"Joe Friday\\" in the Dragnet television series- a truly disturbing and frightening countenance.  This version also tried to remain true to the Orwellian vision, although it was infused with 50's moral values superimposed in a Big Brother society.  In both the versions mentioned so far, Donald Pleasance of \\"Halloween\\" fame delivers  outstanding performances.  These versions are worthy of finding and purchasing for the viewing of Pleasance's performances.<br /><br />The third version \\"1984\\" was produced in 1984 by Radford.  This version is the quintessential version that is more Orwellian than Orwell!  This version is far more subtle and menacing than the previous versions.  Even the picture of this Big Brother is so subtle and frightening!  By the time of the movie's ending, we know what kind of smile is hidden under Big Brother's mustache!  John Hurt is the perfect Winston Smith, even to his similar appearance to George Orwell!  Richard Burton's role as O'brien is the crown jewel of his entire acting career.  Ever so soft spoken, ever so patronizing, ever so menacing and ever so cruel.  This movie was filmed in desaturated colors, faithfully replicating the mood of Orwell's novel.  And the soundtrack performed by the Eurythmics was the perfect marriage.  Those fortunate enough to have purchased this version on VHS tape should hold on to that tape, because it is a valuable contribution to the art of movie making.<br /><br />The fourth version \\"1984\\" was made in the early 2000's by MGM.  It is the Radford version made in 1984, sans the desaturated colors and sans the Eurythmics.  It is disappointing for several reasons.  The original Radford vision is ruined by the saturated colors, that alone destroys the mood of the film.  Also missed is the Eurythmics soundtrack.  Also there are few bonuses on this DVD version for the USA.  What a disappointment.  Yet it is still worth having, because the Orwellian vision remains intact.<br /><br />If you want choices in the DVD, purchase the English PAL version at the English Amazon site.

B0037QGS0K|4.0|A few months ago, I bought a copy of The Road and, as usual, when I first explore a new Sony disc, the first thing I like to look at is the trailer gallery (Sony always has the best). The very first trailer was for Chloe, the new Atom Egoyan flick.  Now I was intriqued.  Egoyan has been one of my favorite directors since I watched The Sweet Hereafter.  Plus it had both Julianne Moore and Amanda Seyfried, two of the sexiest women in the biz right now.  So I knew I had to see it.<br /><br />  Fast forward to just last night.  Around 2am, and having nothing better to do, I decided to finally pop it in the machine and I must say, I was pretty much kept on the edge of my seat throughout most of the flick.<br /><br />  The story goes that Julianne Moore plays the wife of a popular music professor.  Their marriage has apparently gone stale since he tends to try and stay out of town with his students and, it seems, has no sexual feelings towards her any more.  Even their son appears to dislike her.  One night while at dinner, she meets a seemingly shy young girl who, in reality, is a call girl.  From here, Julianne hatches a plan to see if this girl, Chloe, can seduce her husband.  She is to meet him and report back to her at the end of each session.  Trouble is, when you play with fire, you end of getting burned.<br /><br />  I really like the look and feel to this movie.  The characters, especially our two leading ladies, were well rounded.  Liam Neeson turns in a fairly good performance but, sadly, still appears to be coping with the lost of real life wife, Natshia Richardson who died not to long before this film was completed.  It seems weird for Atom Egoyan to be helming this project.  This doesn't seem to be his normal subgenre.  You would think, giving the whole infidelity angle, that Chloe would be more up Adrian Lyne's alley which it does seem given that the third act does take more of a Fatal Attraction/Poison Ivy/Obsessed turn which, in my opion, drug the movie down.  Had he simply stuck with the idea of being lured in to Chloe's charm and powers of persuasion, the movie may have been a pretty successful hit.  Not saying that this movie was bad, far from it.  In fact, I'm surprised that this movie was released straight to dvd with such star power while Obsessed was given a theatrical run given that that movie had the whole feel of a D2D.  Still, its worth at least a peak.he simply stuck with the idea of being lured in to Chloe's charm and powers of persuasion, the movie may have been a pretty successful hit.

Mojo is excellent music and the surround mix is way cool, immersing you in the Heartbreakers unparalleled musicianship.  The songs are mostly good here, but the real joy of this recording is listening to one of the best bands out there interacting with each other.  You know you really love a band when you just enjoy listening to them play - anything, that is.  Very few bands merit listening for the sake of listening, but the Heartbreakers do.  Mike Campbell has been one of the best guitarists out there for a long time, and Benmont Tench simply IS rock's best keyboard player.  Great music making.  More, please.

0425206211|1.0|I read \\"Persuader\\" and found it so good I ordered the rest of the set and read \\"Killing Floor\\", and liked it. So \\"Die Trying\\" was a complete surprise, so different, so poor in comparison. There were several errors, I would hate to try to be a sniper and shoot according to the detailed version Child gives, I could hit nothing. Has he ever fired a sniper rifle? Then when it came to communications, trying to intercept modern transmissions, particularly burst or spread spectrum, well, I don't know if he he even knows there are such things. Those are only two errors, there are more but he is an author, an author can put anything he wants in his stories, the only requirement is that he captures and holds the interest of the reader. That must be why Reacher does not kill Borkin when he has the chances early in the story, there would not be a story of Reacher acted as his character seems to dictate from the other stories I read. With Borkin dead, what holds the plot together? What plot would there be? I found his details too boring, too long, and often incorrect. As an author he can do what he wants, but why bore us to death? There were areas of interest, does Child know what a northwest forest looks like? Also he should know the geology of the last glacial age, how and where they ground out the features. What a shame, I hope his other stories recapture his ability as shown in the other two stories I mentioned.
B000CNESU8|5.0|Watch this movie and then consider what has become of television \\"news\\" since the release year of \\"Network\\" (1976).  You will have to conclude that writer Paddy Chayefsky had a fully functioning crystal ball.      In addition to its pin-point accuracy in predicting the future of the television news industry, \\"Network\\" remains an enormously entertaining film.  A superlative cast and director in combination with Paddy Chayefsky's stunning screenplay make it one of the truly memorable films of the 1970's.  I always become a little ill when I consider that \\"Rocky'' received the Academy Award for Best Picture instead of this film or \\"All the President's Men\\" -- something for which I will never forgive the Academy in its abject stupidity.  It is for that reason that I have not, to this day, admitted \\"Rocky\\" into my movie collection.    William Holden, Faye Dunnaway and Peter Finch, for which he posthumously received an Academy Award, lead the fine cast.  But for me, it is Robert Duvall who is overwhelming in his brilliant portrayal of Frank Hackett, the corporate hatchet-man.  One must also acknowledge the superb performances of Beatrice Straight for which she won best supporting actress in a role having five or six minutes of screen time and Ned Beatty as the corporate CEO.  This film must be regarded as director Sidney Lumet's masterpiece.       It is easy to draw comparisons between this film and another brilliant film also written by Chayefsky, \\"The Hospital\\" (1971).  In both pictures the phrase, \\"I don't know what you're talking about\\" occurs again and again, signifying the failure of human beings to communicate.  A character in both films has an epiphany or vision that could be seen as a psychotic episode which, however, alters the course of the story.   Each film has a leading character who attempts to maintain the stability of the institution of which he is a part, that is nevertheless descending into madness and chaos.        \\"Network,\\" similar to \\"The Hospital,\\"is satire which tends to turn off many people.  The great playwright George S. Kaufman once observed: \\"Satire is what closes on Saturday night.\\"   In spite of that, \\"Network\\", thirty-fours years later continues to be a fresh and vital work of art as well as a warning as to what our culture may well, at this moment, be turning into.

It sounds like a lot of work, but I have a messed up shoulder and I needed something to keep me from injuring myself again.<br /><br />Soooo, unless somebody comes up with something better than this Post Office Shoulder Pad, I suspect that it very well may be the best thing on the market.

B000H30B2C|4.0|My review of Peter Jackson's King Kong remake will include my opinions about the film and discuss the extensive amount of bonus material on this extended three disc set, so if you're still interested grab a seat cause were just getting started.<br /><br />I've never had any special attachment to the King Kong franchise, but I have always found the premise intriguing and a joy to watch. I have seen the original stop motion cinema classic, the unappreciated 1976 remake and now the most recent 2005 remake by director Peter Jackson. And if I had to choose from the three, I would honestly choose this version. Now you may be angry but please let me explain why, I'm not saying this version is without its flaws, there are many but I personally found the bond between Ann Darrow and Kong better than the original classic. In the original film despite Kong saving her numerous times she's still terrified and screams almost constantly. But of course it was an older film and that film is still superior to most horror/adventure films to this day. And like I said, it was a horror film, in horror films women scream... a lot. But now times have changed and today's movie plot's have changed and I think this remake came at a good time. Another reason I appreciate this film is because Peter Jackson grew up a big fan of the original classic and he had a passion for this project, and you can tell by the finishing product. To me this film felt like following several different sub stories. Ann's struggle finding work as an actress, and her struggle to survive after being captured by Kong, Carl Denham's who is struggling as a film director and feels he has a chance to revive his career if he can find \\"Skull Island\\" and film it, Jack Driscoll's love for Ann and of course Kong's, who is a lonely animal and probably the last of his species. But there are also many other sub plots with the men of the \\"Venture\\" and they are also interesting to follow.<br /><br />But to me the most important reason why this is my favorite Kong film is because I became emotionally attached with Kong, I felt sorry for this beast that had no escape while fighting off the airplanes at the top of the empire state building and the reason is because of the incredible, and I do mean incredible special effects. King Kong and the creatures all look absolutely fantastic, and Kong's eyes really have emotion in them. But we can't give all the credit to special effects, many of Kong's life like emotions from the film came from Andy Serkis, who helped with the movements and facial expressions for Kong and there is some very interesting footage of Andy acting as Kong in the bonus material. You really have to see the creatures of Skull Island for yourself, to the gigantic insects or the mega ton dinosaurs they all just look so life like. But unfortunately I do have some complaints, but before I complain yes I do know this is a film from Hollywood, it's just a movie and King Kong is a ridiculous film if it's taken seriously. But how in the world does Ann not get crushed by Kong?! During the huge fight with the \\"V\\" Rex he's fighting three, THREE V Rexes while holding her during much of it. And when Kong, Ann and the V Rex family get tangled in the vines after they fall off the cliff she at one point is holding on to a V Rexes tooth. I mean, this makes the movie so unbelievable that you can't take any of these scenes seriously. And I also found all the fight scenes on Skull Island to get repetitive. At one point there is a creature attacking while the Venture crew is paddling across the swamp, the crew falling into a pit and getting attacked by huge insects, Kong fighting the V Rexes, and a couple other prehistoric type creatures that attack but it feels like it comes at you all at once. I understand these scenes being in the movie, but if shortened and spread out I think it would make the journey through Skull Island more believable and a little less repetitive. Oh, and don't get me started onthe islander's, I just found them annoying, and they just got tiresome and I'm glad they are not in the film much. Well I'm worn out, let's discuss the DVD set.<br /><br />For this DVD and this DVD only you get around thirteen minutes of extra footage during the movie that was not originally featured during its theatrical release, and that reason alone is a great reason to buy this DVD, but the makers of this DVD didn't stop there, but I'll get into that later. Now, the film is spread out on to two discs, as well is the commentary, but it didn't bother me at all actually. When you finish the first half of the movie on disc one you can just pop in disc two and it will have a menu that asks if you want to continue the film or commentary immediately or if you just want to go to the main menu, and really, are we all so lazy that we can't just place another disc in? We are?! Oh...well it probably won't bother you. The commentary with Peter Jackson is incredibly interesting as well, and pretty funny actually.  And also included are around forty minutes of deleted scenes with introductions with Peter Jackson. But that is just the beginning, there is also a hysterical gag reel entitled the Eighth \\"Blunder\\" of the World and there are a couple other goofy featurettes with the cast. But if you want to find out information about how the film was created, pop in disc three. There are so many lengthy and interesting documentaries you will just be amazed. In a category called \\"Re-creating the Eighth Wonder\\" the Making of King Kong, you will find several twenty to forty minute documentaries that discuss Pre-production, filming the Venture Journey, creating and filming Skull Island, creating New York In New Zealand and the crew's visit to New York, and of course the development of Kong himself. The information is so extensive that the approximate running time is around two and a half to three hours. And if you still aren't satisfied there are featurettes that pay tribute to the original King Kong and the resemblances with the original and the 2005 remake, there also is a featurette about the collectibles created during the release of King Kong, video galleries, trailers and some selected Pre-Visualization Animatics from the movie. And if you aren't satisfied after all of these fascinating bonus features...I'll be at a loss for words.<br /><br />Everyone has mixed feelings about this movie as do I, but I think Peter Jackson did an excellent job at capturing Kong not just as a ferocious beast, but as a caring and lonely creature, and if you want to find out how King Kong was made this three disc extended edition is a highly recommended buy.I just found them annoying, and they just got tiresome and I'm glad they are not in the film much.

B003EYVXYQ|5.0|Got my preorder in the mail the other today. I loved the movie. Maybe even the best Romero zombie film since Day of the Dead. Great themes in the film, perhaps the deepest themes in a Remero zombie movie yet. It's basically about human conflict and how people can not stop fighting eachother no matter how bad things get and how much they need eachoter. The human characters in this film are obviously far worse than the zombies. The themes on religion, family, and solving social ills were also good.     On top of that, it was just a lot of fun over all. Hek, even the special effects were good. The CGI looked very realistic, definitely a lot better than Diary of the Dead. The fire extinguisher scene was a bit iffy, but other than that everything looked great imo. I was kinda worried about that after all the groaning due to Romero's interview about the special effects, but I was proven wrong.     It also had great oldschool cinematography and I loved the over the top oldschool acting from the heads of the two feuding clans. Also pleased that Romero finally inlcuded a gay character in one of his casts.     I definitely think this film will be a success on the home video market, which means we'll be getting a follow up soon. I thought there was something up with the premptive nerd venom spat towards this film before it even came out on DVD, but again they are proven wrong as far as I'm concerned. I'm sure the sales of Bluray and DVD will outvote the people who have to hate a Romero movie untill the next one comes out. Then they get to position themselves as liking the previous entry while hating the current offering. That's how it has worked since Day of the Dead.

0399229191|4.0|In this pleasant sequel to [[ASIN:0399208534 The Very Hungry Caterpillar]], Eric Carle introduces a spider who, carried by the wind, lands on a fence post and begins to spin her web.  In each two-page spread, a different animal approaches her, inviting her to participate in an activity familiar to them: the horse wants her to go for a ride, the cow invites her to eat some grass, the sheep invites her for a run in the meadow, and so on.  The spider's response to each invitation is silence, because \\"She was very busy spinning her web.\\"  At the end of the story,, the purpose of the web is revealed when a pesty fly (which had buzzed around each animal in the preceding pages) meets its fitting end, and the spider settles down to sleep, satisfied after her busy day.<br /><br />This great toddler book has a lot going for it.  Farm animals introduce themselves with their characteristic sound and behavior, we learn about a spider's natural behavior, and each turn of the page page brings another pleasing repetition of greeting and silence that moves the story along nicely, while retaining the attention of preverbal listeners.<br /><br />The spider's example of steady, goal-oriented and satisfying work is a good model for children who need to grow up into productive adults.  While the book doesn't have quite the brilliance of [[ASIN:0399208534 The Very Hungry Caterpillar]], it is a good addition to a child's reading basket.

B002ZG9846|5.0|Well, you'll be happy to know that it won't be long before we are stuffing our faces with mutated popcorn slime (now with ginkgo biloba!) and cheering on our box office superheroes as they torture their \\"evil\\" victims with tactics that make waterboarding seem refreshing by comparison. That's about when Dick Cheney and his war machine will be celebrated for being ahead of their time on the empathy spectrum, currently undergoing recalibration -- y'know, now that kids are taking blood thinner to make cutting more interesting. And Shrub Jr. and the five-hearted Cheneyblob will rise to vanquish the pundits who were accidentally not paid off back in 2002, due to general incompetence (and not, contrary to popular belief, a liberal conspiracy -- which of course is an oxymoron, whereas \\"evolution theory\\" is a redundancy).<br /><br />So whatever is going to help us get this Republican agenda restarted is good with me -- be it putting weapons of mass destruction in the hands of 8-year-old girls and ordering them to kill members of SAG in juicy CGI detail, or teaching a dribbling sack of charbroiled hormones that he's only going to get his willy the wet wink if he puts a stop to bullying by becoming a bigger bully. As long as the bottom line is that the Grand Olde Party gets its keister back in the driver seat, so we can continue making the rich richer, and the poor poorer, faster!!

B000NU2CY4|5.0|One of the best movies ever. The blueray is expensive though, this is a classic movie they should make it cheaper.    It is very violent for a drama so be forewarned about that.
B003PIUC02|5.0|This was one of the best miniseries I have seen.  The acting fantastic and the story was great, kept you wanting to see more.  I think men and women will like it, it is gory,  but I loved it.  I thought the scenes were very well done.  Congratulations to the team that made up Spartacus !!
006136472X|4.0|Although entertaining, not nearly at the same level as \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" or \\"World Without End\\".  Takes what seems like a very long time to set up the plot and create the characters.  After that's accomplished, the real action begins. Or, let's delete the word \\"real\\".  The feats the hero accomplishes are so totally impossible, that not even the most powerful super heros would attempt.  Wow, can anyone really do that? The answer is \\"no\\". I like action narratives, but this is just beyond belief.  Should have been a comic book!
B001DPHDCY|4.0|This is a very cute movie that is great for the whole family.  However the ending came too quickly and suddenly and left me somewhat confused.  Putting that aside, it was great entertainment for a lovely afternoon with the family.
B000S1M9LY|2.0|I decided to try this book based on several good reviews and the fact that Time magazine had rated it as one of the 100 best books of the 20th century. I read over 400 pages of it before I gave up. If you enjoy 50 page descriptions of such obscure subject matter as competitive youth tennis or if you want to explore, ad nauseum and in more than vivid detail the world of overwhelming addiction, then this just might be the book for you. And if you are able to connect the youth tennis angle to the addiction angle, more power to you. I just couldn't do it. I was able to accept from the first few pages that this was a \\"weird\\" book that would require a lot of effort, but I could not keep up the effort for 1000+ pages. This is not a good book, despite the hype and the critical reviews. It might be an OK distraction if you have weeks and/or months to spend, but trust me there are much better ways, and better books on which, to spend your time. If you like quirky depressing fiction, try Chuck Palahniuk. His stuff is more in your face and brutal, but at least it doesn't waste your time. Or check out Lionel Shriver or Sam Lipscomb for more subtle offerings. This book is literally and figuratively a boat anchor. Stay away.
B001QOGYBI|1.0|I had high hopes for this movie, as the \\"experts\\" gave it glowing reviews.  Thank goodness I rented this from the library before buying it!  This has to be one of the worst movies ever created.  It was so boring I could not even make it through the first half of the movie.  The characters are flat and unmemorable.  The voices were uninterested and almost seemed bored themselves.  There really is no plot or purpose to the movie.  No wonder it did so poorly in the box office.
B002ZG997C|4.0|The music is haunting, the landscape stark, and the action sparse yet violent. Wandering through this wasteland, Denzel Washington is Eli, a machete-wielding stoic on a mission to carry a mysterious book to safety in the west. He travels alone. He encounters marauders and cannibals. \\"Stay on the path . . . it's not my concern\\" is the mantra running through his head, as he maneuvers this post-apocalyptic obstacle course.<br /><br />Carnegie is the man standing in his way. Carnegie, played by Gary Oldham with a fine balance between restraint and melodrama, is the self-appointed mayor of an outlaw town, where people barter for food and water, where terror rules. Carnegie is old enough to remember the days before the war that destroyed life as we know it, and he understands the power of one book to shape and manipulate the masses to his will. He calls this religious book \\"a weapon,\\" but he intends to use it for his own purposes. Eli, on the other hand, wants to use this weapon for good, just as he uses his machete to divvy out his own forms of righteous judgment. Along the way, he finds a friend in Solara, a young woman wanting to escape the madness of Carnegie's town, but only toward the end of the story does Eli realize that his own preoccupation with saving the book has blinded him to its central messages of love and self-sacrifice.<br /><br />The movie plods forward just as Eli does, step by step, slowly, methodically, but with purpose and faith. Some have called that boring, whereas I appreciated directors who treated us with respect and allowed us time to care about the characters and think over the themes. What may seem heavy-handed the first time through becomes more subtle and intriguing when watching again. There are layers to this story that move me emotionally. It's not a perfect film, but it's one that has the courage to pursue a purpose and do so artistically.<br /><br />I saw it in theaters, bought the DVD, and added the soundtrack to my wish list. This is one \\"book\\" that still means something new every time I \\"open\\" it up.means something new every time I \\"open\\" it up.
B00288KNL8|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  This is certainly NOT a child's movie however, as the themes are entirely too dark and scary for children - several of the characters are \\"murdered\\" by the \\"other mother.\\"  The ending was also extremely anti-clamatic and left me wanting more.  In addition, the 3D effects were nonexistant.  In fact, it was so hard to watch in \\"3D\\" that I ended up skipping the glasses and watching it without them for 90% of the movie.  Even in an extremely dark room there were hardly any 3D effects.  And on top of that, the glasses made the screen darker so the rest of the movie was hard to see with them on.  So skip the glasses, and watch the movie in \\"2D\\" for best enjoyment.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|Originally  I wanted give  this  opus 1 star  then  I asked  myself--how  come the  movie dont state the  reason why women dont  have  kids? And  as  I live  in USA I looked  around and  the  answer became  cristal clear--because women  dont  have  sex, thats  why.   In USA  sex is  commercial  enterprise  in which  men  have to pay  no  matter  what setup  they  are in and   somehow our  government likes it  that way. However this  lead to  unexpected development one  of  which  is alienation and instead of being busy with families men are busy with  fighting. And, as you may expect, this  flick avoid anything remotely connected to sex  as plaque. Great! Straght to garbage!

Katniss has matured and hardened. She has to face the realities of being \\"The Mockingjay\\". It's not something she can escape from just because the games are over. There are still those who want to use her and what she represents for their own goals, but this time she's in control. She also comes to the realization that she needs help, not an easy admission for her.<br />One thing I really loved about this book is that she has relationships with the other characters for once. The romance takes a back seat, as it should, although it is always looming in the background (and a decision is made) but in Mockingjay we get to see her interact with the others and expand her sometimes narrow views. Instead of being the loner, questioning everyone's motives, she has to work with a team to take down The Capitol. I liked that she was able to form a bond with her former tributes - Finnick & Johanna.<br />She's not the only one who has been changed by the games. Peeta, Gale, Haymitch, Johanna and Finnick are also profoundly affected by the manipulations of President Snow. They are not the same people we read about in The Hunger Games. We learn more about their backgrounds and just how evil The Capitol was in keeping an iron grip on the residents of the 12 Districts. The parallels to war and its effects on the psyche of its victims are the driving force in this, the last chapter to The Hunger Games series. Suffice to say it made for some rough reading at times.<br />The relationship between Katniss and Haymitch was the most profound to me. What has he been to Katniss? Mentor? Traitor? Friend? He has now become Katniss's conscience and the person who knows her best, because honestly - they are so much alike. Sometimes Katniss needs a whack upside the head! I love her but she can be incredibly self-absorbed. My heart went out to Haymitch as we learned about his past and I was happy to see his character get a bit more development.<br />And I'm going to give a little shout out to Buttercup - Prim's cat - yes Buttercup. Katniss's interactions with him provide a welcome respite from the relentlessly bleak backdrop and let us in on a vulnerable side of Katniss that we don't often see.<br />If I have one complaint it would be that Collins delved a little too deep in explaining certain things such as each line of a song but then hurried along at other (more important IMO) points. There were a few important conversations and scenes that I would have liked to have read but were left out.<br />Many of the themes and symbols from the first two books were carried through to the finale and most things are resolved. There are twists and turns that I'm sure you won't see coming. While a few things happened that people predicted, I'm going to go out on a limb and say most of you will be shocked by at least once during this book. I personally was stunned at the path she took - I expected something....different....more epic and yes I was a little disappointed after all the buildup.<br />I don't think this is my favorite book in the series but it is a fitting end to one of the best YA series I've read in years.

0439023513|3.0|I felt a little disappointed by Mockingjay, compared to Hunger Games and Catching Fire.    -SPOILERS AHEAD-    Collins seems to have abandoned focusing on even a little on the love triangle, leaving you to wonder throughout the entire book what she is thinking about them between the two.  When Peeta is rescued, Snow has brain washed him into thinking that Katniss is the bad guy -- and she just doesn't bother with him until Haymitch says something to her.     First of all, since when did Haymitch go from a drunk with withdrawals to the sweetheart? (Pun intended). And I don't think anybody wanted to imagine Peeta as a tough guy choking Katniss.    Also, she kills of so many main characters -- it kind of feels like she was trying to just get her point across that this was the end, and there couldn't be a happy ending. Finnick dies, right after he gets Annie back and is able to come out of his slump. Primrose dies in the end, which seems to defeat the purpose of EVERYTHING that Katniss has done. Also, she passes out during the battle in front of the capitol, leaving dozens of questions.     Literally, it's all gore and violence in front of Snow's mansion, and then, suddenly, Snow is captured.     Also, hearing Katniss say at the end that she supports the decision for the Capitol's Children to be forced into the Hunger Games kills me. In the end, Katniss goes back to District 12. Without Primrose and without her mother.    It ends telling the story of her life with Peeta and her children.    However, Collins still manages to hold me throughout the book because of her beautiful writing. She is amazing at making images colorful and vivid, and keeping you on the edge of your seat.

The crew of the 'Belle', a B-17 Fortress that could dish it out as well as take it, were the first crew to do so. This is their story mainly based on their final mission. The battle scenes are good white-knucklers that will make you feel the tension, the fear and the elation of feeling the wheels finally touchdown at home base. They were snot-nosed kids of 19 years or so when they left for the war, and were seasoned men when they completed their tour.<br />Look for Harry Connick Jr and his Big Band performance.

But the visuals and music, which are equal partners with the rest of the characters, are more intense.<br /><br />Watching the Blu-ray extras, the voice over by conceptual designer Brian Froud, who also did the voice over for \\"Labyrinth\\", we find that the title of this film might have been \\"Dark Chrysalis\\" as it is a movie about change.<br /><br />Take hart that they did not place a lot of coming attractions at the front of the DVD and that the Blu-ray extras sill do not get in the way of the film as some do.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00005MEVQ Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth]]<br />[[ASIN:B000R8YC1S Labyrinth (Anniversary Edition)]]<br />[[ASIN:B000EU1Q5E Jim Henson's the Storyteller - The Definitive Collection]]<br />[[ASIN:B000GFRI5E Jim Henson's Fantasy Film Collection - (Labyrinth / MirrorMask / The Dark Crystal)]]
0439023513|3.0|I was so excited to get this book in the mail. I had waited sooooo long for the book to come out only to putting it down with in the first 30 pages, thinking \\"what\\". The first two books were so intresting that even as a mother of 4 with a full time job I would spend all night reading and finish the books in one night. That was not the case with mockingjay. I have to say it took me over 2 weeks to finish and I only read the book when I was waiting for others to come in the mail, but upon saying that I do realize that maybe the first two books were just so good that this book had a lot to live up to, I don't know. I gave it three stars because I understand writing a series like this can't be easy, but it was not worth the money and time I spend on it.
038532653X|4.0|Michael is twelve years old, lives in his new house with his mom, dad and baby sister, who is very sick with a weak heart. One day while in the garage in his backyard, Michael finds an odd creature, a man, with a squeaky voice, bugs crawling all over him and tattered clothes.<br /><br />Michael tells his best friend Mina about his discovery, he wants to make sure that what he is seeing is real and not just his imagination. Mina is homeschooled and has a passion for William Blake's poetry, which appears throughout the story.<br />We later find out that this creatures name is Skellig and that he has wings. What he truly is or where he has come from, remains a mystery. He is clearly sick and Michael decides he needs to nurse him back to health.<br /><br />Michael's baby sisters illness is always on his mind, and he feels as though when he feels his own heart beating, he can also feel the baby's. I loved the thought of that.<br />I enjoyed this book very much. There's that bit of creepiness to the story, due to the way Skellig is described. And there is also that mystery as to what this creature really is. He seems to be angelic, but has features and habits that go against how we might think an angel would be.<br /><br />Michael is likeable right away, he has a kind heart. He wants to nurse Skellig back to health. He visits him and brings him food. The way he loves and worries over his baby sister is also touching. His baby sisters illness is a big part of the story, as are his parents and the way they deal with it.<br />All in all, a great read. Highly recommended.<br /><br />'Writing can be difficult, but sometimes it really does feel like a kind of magic. I think that stories are living things-among the most important things in the world.' -David Almond
B0019N8P2W|5.0|After such a long wait for this, I couldn't give the DVD set anything less than 5 stars!  Watching the series, however, I was disappointed that most of the music was missing.  I wouldn't really mind - I don't remember any specific songs to miss, however in several episodes the music was removed and no background was added, leaving parts of episodes with odd \\"white noise\\" in the background instead of music or sound effects.<br />Also, there really aren't any bonuses in this set.  You get the episodes, the movies, and some of the episodes have intros from the MTV \\"Daria Day\\" marathon they held.  That's it.  No behind the scenes, no interviews, no cheesy games. I guess you do get one Mystic Spiral music video.<br /><br />So.  The series is finally available.  It is just as awesome as I remember from my angsty teen years.  Just don't hope for any extra frills.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book had me hooked from the first page.  Collins has set the bar high for future authors in this phenominal end to a riviting trilogy.  She has used Peeta's gift of words and combined  thriller with love story and a dash of sorrow with a sprinkle of happiness.  Collins has put up yet another idea of what may happen to our world in the years to come and what may happen to our future generations.  *Spoiler*  I sobbed when Prim turned into a 'torch', was shocked when Katniss aimed for Coin instead of Snow, appalled when Gale and Katniss' mother moved on, and astounded when she fell for no other than Peeta Mellark.  J.K. Rowling better pack her bags.
B000E8NQU4|5.0|Yes disc 1 is in SACD. However, it is not 5.1 surround sound as other reviewers have said. Still it is an awesome recording, well worth owning. You can still hear seperation with the two front speakers. The bass does come out of the subwoofer. The sound clarity is outstanding, clean and crisp. This was one of the Moddy Blues' best recordings. Great music to listen to at anytime. I haven't listened to disc 2 yet, but I will in 7-channel stereo. I'm sure it will sound very nice as well....maybe not as clean as the SACD, but very nice as well.
B000001GX8|5.0|This 1968 version by Mr. Karl Boehm and his illustrious cast really posed a difficult problem to me - which is the 'best' recording of 'Le Nozze di Figaro'? Erich Klieber's, or Karl Boehm's?<br />I owned Kleiber the elder's set for quite some years without daring to try out Mr. Boehm's, largely unwilling to allow myself to yield to 'another' better version.<br />The truth is, I think, neither version outdid the other. Both are equally good and in many respects, both are unsurpassed.<br />I believe that Erich Kleiber's recording dates a bit further back than Boehm's. The casts are entirely different.  Kleiber lined up a cast that is partially Italian and partially Austrian. This mixture adds much to the idiomaticity of the enunciations by the singers.<br />In the lead role, Cesare Siepi's Figaro is a robust and witty character, verbally incisive. Hermann Prey for Boehm is a sunny character, also witty, but less biting. Perhaps, in terms of characterisation, Figaro's portrayal sets the tone for the entire drama. Boehm's 'Le Nozze' is clearly a more light-hearted version.<br />The Susanna for Kleiber, Hilde Gueden, had a slight edge over the almost equally good Edith Mathis, but for the latter's slightly forced articulation at times.<br />The countesses are well-matched in almost every respect. Apart from Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, it is difficult to imagine any other lyrical soprano to come up with a better rendition than either Lisa della Casa or Gundula Janowitz!<br />The main difference in these two sets lies in Alfred Poell's less than colorful Almaviva and Fischer-Dieskau's spiteful and chilly account. Undisputably, the latter has a much clearer vocal portrayal of this less than lovely major character.<br />Suzanne Danco and Tatiana Troyanos represent the differences between a soprano Cherubino and mezzo Cherubino. Either way, both offered an effective account of this secondary character.<br />Accoustic wise, DG's remastered 1968 vinyl recording of Karl Boehm has a clear edge over Decca's analogue early stereo recording.<br />At the end of the day, which set prevails is more a choice between two different visions of this forever-loved masterpiece.arly stereo recording.

It probably began when Captain Kirk first had sex with the green slave chick in Star Trek. Even people who never saw the scene have heard about that love-in.<br /><br />  Later on, Natasha Henstridge came into the sci-fi circuit with her depiction of Sil, a sex-crazed alien/humanoid man-eater, in Species. Many believe that this movie first spawned the notion that if there was ever a good way to go out, it would be during sex...with a boney-looking alien straight from a painting by HR Giger.<br /><br />  Then recently, countless fan-boys began re-watching Avatar in the hopes of catching Zoe Saldana bare a breast, since she seemed half-naked throughout the movie. Blue skin and four times the size of a human? Bah, who needs to be picky. This is a generation of fan-boys that watched the Snoo-Snoo episode of Futurama and thought, \\"Hey, that probably wouldn't be too bad.\\"<br /><br />  Which brings us to Splice.<br /><br />  The movie starts out fairly well. Two bio-chemists, Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast (played by Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley), are in the midst of a huge scientific breakthrough: the merging of the genetic code of every single animal class, except human. They have created male and female versions of what look like giant bloody sponges that move around on their own and create some sort of protein that will be used in pharmaceuticals. The scientists, of course, want to go further, and add human DNA to the mix. The company says, \\"No dice.\\" The scientists do it anyway, and create an ugly-looking gerbil with a wicked tail that, through nurturing and caring, evolves into Billy Corgan(played by Delphine Chan&eacute;ac) at an accelerated aging rate.<br />  The storyline is very thought-provoking, as Clive and Elsa struggle with the moralistic principles of using human DNA to create an organism, hopes for their future together, and some deep skeletons in the family history. You see the struggles of these people, both internally and externally, as their relationship with Billy Corgan (I mean, DREN) evolves.<br /><br />  Sounds intense, right? Well, it is. Until Adrien Brody decides to have sex with it.<br /><br />  Yes, in an apparent loss of judgement, Adrien Brody gets horny, and destroys any semblence of a serious movie by banging his creation, which is almost like his daughter, making it even more perverted. After that, I couldn't stop laughing whenever he came on-screen (mmph).<br /><br />  Not only does he have sex with DREN, but he gets caught by his screen wife, Sarah Polley. Then he returns home and tries to explain his way out of cheating on her with their mutant spawn. AND IT WORKS!!!!<br /><br />  From here on out the movie is pure comedy, as you can't help but giggle at Adrien Brody. It ends with DREN turning into a male, raping his mom Sarah Polley(who we learn used her own DNA to construct DREN), and getting pregnant.<br /><br />  I don't know where I thought this movie was going to go when it was good, but it sure wasn't here.<br /><br />  I give the movie 2 out of 5 Natasha Henstridge aliens.

B002ZG997M|2.0|Earth, post-apocalypse; radiation poisoning; Denzel Washington; Gary Oldman; cannibals. How can a movie go wrong with these elements? The Book of Eli shows us how.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />  The end of the world as we know it. It is such a morbid topic, yet pop culture embraces it so tightly. They also seem to embrace Jersey Shore and conspiracy theories with the same fervor, but it doesn't seem as saturated. In the past 6 months, we have had the opportunity to see 2012, Legion, The Tooth Fairy, and, our topic film, The Book of Eli. All four movies deal with some sort of \\"end of the world as we know it\\" theme(I'm guessing The Tooth Fairy does, since Dwayne Johnson in ballet tights sounds to be in line with rivers turning to blood and locust swarms).<br /><br />  I can only guess that the reason is to say to the audience, \\"Aw, you can't buy a new car after 2 years? Well, it could be worse.\\" Personally, I'd rather laugh at a decent comedy, but to each their own.<br /><br />  The Book of Eli takes place about 30 years after a massive war broke out upon the earth. Nuclear warfare apparently destroyed the ozone layer, and anyone taking a leisurely stroll in the park or walking their dog was burnt to a crisp. The lucky ones, who were inside watching Jerry Springer, survived, and did what they could to continue surviving for about a year, when they were finally able to go out into a barren wasteland the likes of the video game Fallout 3. At least, that's what \\"Walker\\"(Denzel Washington) tells us, along with some reflective Christian teachings and an anecdote about being wasteful and having more than you need.<br /><br />  Walker is a man who has been walking for over 30 years across the remaining United States of America to deliver a bible out west. The actual place he needs to go is unknown. All Walker knows is that he'll have a feeling when he arrives. Why it takes him 30 years to walk across the USA is something you learn later.<br /><br />  In his travels he forages for food and water, fights off ambush parties, listens to his iPod, and reads the bible. He comes across a town run by Gary Oldman, who has been searching for a bible to help control his little town. Obviously, Walker isn't going to give it up without a fight, because then there would hardly be any movie to watch.<br /><br />  So what's good about this movie? Well, the scenery is awesome. Anyone who played the video game Fallout 3 will feel quite at home with the landscapes. It's almost as if images were lifted from the game and shot live-action, begging for a live-action movie of its own.<br /><br />  The depiction of life post-apocalyptica is interesting, as well. Of course, we've seen most of this before in the Mad Max series, but it is thought-provoking just the same.<br /><br />  Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman do a great job with what they are given as characters. Anyone less would have probably made me walk out of this film. Sadly, there is only so much that talented actors can do to keep a film above water. Mila Kunis is good eye candy, especially in a movie where most people have weird growths coming out of their faces. The rest of the movie just gets drawn out and annoying.<br /><br />  For one, the \\"twist\\"(for spoiler-free purposes) of Walker is aggravating. If you look back on the movie, you can understand why he does certain things because of this twist, but at the same time there are other elements and shots that don't make sense. It seems that half the time, the director is fighting between storyline and scenery. Obviously, scenery kept on winning, making the movie pretty shallow.<br /><br />  The religious theme also irked me, but not as much as I'd thought. While Gary Oldman's interpretation as the Devil incarnate was fantastic, the use of theology to explain away how Walker keeps on trucking is tired and uninteresting. Granted, it's hard to do the movie without the book of Eli, but with the human side of Walker coming only at the very, very end, it's hard to take the religious overtones seriously.<br /><br />  In the end, I give this movie 2 out of 5 Pip-Boy 3000s.end, it's hard to take the religious overtones seriously.       In the end, I give this movie 2 out of 5 Pip-Boy 3000s.
B00005JKED|5.0|It's interesting how some of our best actors give some of their best performances playing thoroughly detestable characters.  It's as if they were able to tap into the dark side that lurks inside all of us in varying degrees, and play it to the hilt while enjoying every minute of it.  Richard Gere playing a venal cop in \\"Internal Affairs\\".  Ralph Fiennes as a loathsome concentration camp commander in \\"Schindler's List\\", and playing the ultimate bad guy as Harry Potter's nemesis Voldemort.  Humphrey Bogart as Dobbs in \\"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\\".  And now comes Denzel Washington, usually the squeaky-clean hero of whatever film he's in, giving a bang-up performance as Alonzo Harris, a LAPD detective who is rotten to the core.<br /><br />\\"Training Day\\" chronicles one momentous day, from dawn to midnight, in the lives of two cops.  Jake Hoyt is a newly minted detective, anxious to make the grade in Alonzo Harris's elite narcotics squad, who takes \\"Serve And Protect\\" seriously.  He rides shotgun with Alonzo for the day.  Alonzo is going to break him in to what being a narcotics detective is about.  But Jake finds out that Alonzo has his own code that has nothing to do with serving or protecting, and everything to do with exploiting the people he's supposed to serve and protect.  He robs the dealers and steals their cash.  He breaks into people's homes with fake warrants.  \\"I got 'em all under my thumb\\", he brags about the inhabitants of the Los Angeles ghettos.  We soon realize that Alonzo's superiors have allowed him to do pretty much whatever he wants to do as long as he doesn't embarrass them by getting caught.  But Alonzo has his own problems, which require prompt resolution -- a very expensive weekend in Las Vegas left the Russian mafia into him for one million dollars, payable by midnight if he wants to live to see the dawn, and he's not past doing whatever he has to in order to come up with that sum, including armed robbery and homicide.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke gives the performance of a lifetime as Jake Hoyt, the idealistic, impressionable young detective who very soon realizes he's riding a tiger he may not be able to shake loose.  It can't be like this, he protests to Alonzo. But Alonzo responds, that's how it is; deal with it.  And Jake is left alone to somehow find his way out of this mess and salvage his own integrity in the process.<br /><br />Along with Hawke and Washington, some minor characters give some outstanding performances.  Chief among them are Scott Glen as Roger, Alonzo's erstwhile friend who has something he very much wants; Cliff Curtis, a hitherto unknown Maori actor from New Zealand who gives a devastating performance as Smiley, the Latino thug from the Hillside Trece gang whom Alonzo sets up to waste Jake, once he realizes there is a limit to his venality past which Jake refuses to cross, at which point Jake becomes a liability; Eva Mendes as one of Alonzo's four babymommies, and Cle Sloan as Bone, the South Central gangbanger who makes Alonzo finally realize that maybe he doesn't have them all under his thumb the way he thought he did.<br /><br />The film gets off to a fairly slow start but after the first fifteen minutes it hits warp speed and never lets up.  Antoine Fuqua directed a great movie that is a star vehicle for two outstanding actors.  It's an ugly picture, and we want to protest along with Jake that it can't be this way, but we have to agree with Alonzo that maybe, sometimes, it is.<br /><br />Judy Lindformance of a lifetime as Jake Hoyt, the idealistic, impressionable young detective who very soon realizes he's riding a tiger he may not be able to shake loose.

B003TJ4YU6|5.0|I will buy this for the great memories. The picture has to be the performance of \\"She Loves You\\".    That said, Two things come to mind. Was it not in Ed's budget to give Paul and George their very own microphones? It worked out happily anyway. Later the band could afford many, many microphones.    Secondly, the drum platform is very small with almost no access. Did they fly Ringo in on a hook or was he able to get positioned with a portable stair before they moved all those arrows in? Or did Ed advise Ringo \\"This is 'shew' business kid, and this is a really big \\"shew\\". You'll just have to scramble up there the best you can.\\"   Loved the Beatles. Loved Ed Sullivan. Wish it came with a bonus feature of those plate twirlers running around to a musical loop of the \\"Sabre Dance\\" by Aram Khachaturia. Oh yes, and Senor Wences with his literal hand puppet.
0316098337|5.0|Some novels defy easy description,and are far greater than the sum of their extraordinary parts.  Some novels remind the reader why fiction exists, must exist, as the way to great truths. [[ASIN:0316098337 Room: A Novel]] is all of that and so much more. Emma Donoghue is an extraordinarily talented writer who uses language with grace and craft and boundless imagination. She is eloquent when that serves the story and her characters, brutal when that is called for, matter of fact when that can be the only response to the situation. You can read any of her novels and be in awe of her skill, but Room shows Donoghue at the top of her game. Room, which has been long-listed for the Booker Prize, is so astonishing, so brilliant, so moving, so terrifying, so life-affirming, so utterly real that you really have to stop reading this review right now, and read this novel. Yes, it not just that good, it is better than you can imagine.

Some brave souls have the courage to shout, in the words of Jon Lovitz, \\"It stinks!\\"      Well, reader, it stinks.  Not only is tbe book unfunny, but the main character, Ignatious J. Reilly, is the most loathesome characeter in literature.  Onboxious, self indulgent, belligernt and whiny, Reilly spends page after page either 'bellowing,' screaming or 'thundering' whevever he is asked to perform the most routine courtesy (such as paying a hot dog vendor after scarfing six franks).  The passages where is is not screaming are dedicated to his incessantly whining about his \\"valve.\\" Reilly takes a job as a file clerk and responds by throwing each document in the garbage and spending his days finger painting. He gets a job as hot dog vendor and eats all his wares then lies to and \\"thunders\\" at his boss, claiming that all the hot dogs were stolen and \\"how dare he\\" place \\"senstive\\" Reilly in such danger. Reilly's \\"valve,\\" of course, suffers.  Each chapter is a repetition of this theme. I finished the book hoping that it must get better, hoping that Reilly would learn, change, or die. None of this occcurs. He is as obnoxious in the final chapter as in the first.     Nor is Reilly the only obnoxious, melodramatic character. His mother, Eileen, insessantly complains to her friend about the \\"disgrace\\" and \\"dishonor\\" of Reilly working as a hot dog vender. Mrs. Levy (wife of a former boss) complains and whines about everything under the sun. Then there's George, the pornography peddling bigot: the reader is treated to George's vile diatribes against homosexuals and African Americans.       Like Reilly himself, Confederacy is, at heart, a bloated, malodorious waste of space.
1416596097|4.0|John LeCarre is one of my favorite authors, unfortunately his best work is now behind him.  This book is OK, but well short of the Smiley series. I do like the moral complexities, still not sure who is on my side in this thing.    A Most Wanted Man starts out in a most compelling way.  LeCarre introduces us in rapid succession to the lead characters -- illegal Turkish immigrants living in Hamburg, a failing but still-important banker, a young German female lawyer with a brutal sense of right and wrong, secret policemen fighting unseen terrorists in a murky post 9/11 world, and our protangonist, the starving, stateless, and homeless Issa, just off the train, truck, and boat from various prisons.     Almost immediately all these characters collide.  Issa is seeking his inheritance of dirty Russian mob money from the banker, while maintaining the moral high-ground. The banker knows his father was a crook in league with gangsters, so the claim is likely real. The banker also sees his wife slipping away from him, so he takes a shine to the lawyer. Issa takes up residence with the Turkish boxer/swimmer and his widowed mother, and gets free legal care. Fortunately everyone speaks Russian or we would never get through the complexities.     Next the policemen show up and start an alphabet soup laden territorial fight. Is this a matter for German security, German police, CIA, or British Intelligence.  All are still smarting that Hamburg was the cradle of the 9/11 terrorists. Eventually we learn that no one is who they say they are and there is no more trust or honor among the police than among the criminals.  The banker steps up, finds a go-between who will send Issa's dirty money to dirty charities. Of course this does not turn out well, when this amount of money moves this fast and far, everyone gets tainted.
B003JTHETY|2.0|Just wanted to add what most people are saying in that the album is amazing but the Mission Edition is really just terrible. It's a cheap aluminum case with the lyrics booklet just wandering around aimlessly inside of it.   The album itself is fantastic and it just keeps getting better every time I listen to it. It's amazing what this band has done and is continuing to do and this is just another bright spot in a long, storied carrier.
B00009YOQW|3.0|I bought this drum for my ten-month-old daughter. The top of the drum is carved out to make, roughly, xylophone keys (not sure how else to describe them) -- little tabs of wood of different lengths that produce different tones. Much like the Plan Toys Xylophone, which we also have, it's made of solid, thick sturdy wood. This is good because I feel pretty safe giving it to her insofar as I don't think she can wreck it at her age. On the down side, this also makes it heavy -- I wouldn't like her to drop it on her toe. Another effect of the thickness of the wood is that the shorter piece don't really sound musical, they sound 'blunt' or 'flat' more like tapping on a wooden table.     Another minor problem is that there are three little rubber feet on the base (I think four would have been better). When the baby leans on the edge of the drum, it tips very easily. As I said, it's heavy and solid, so I stick pretty close to her when she's got it, so she doesn't flip it (or herself). If you want a very solid, nice-looking drum that sounds very mild and quiet, this would be a good choice for you. I was expecting something that sounded a bit more like a musical instrument.

0439023513|3.0|I started reading this book with high hopes and was kept on edge for most of it. Mockingjay was entertaining, but unlike the first two in the series, it had three major flaws.    First complaint- Katniss is clearly at a breaking point in this book and since Mockingjay is written in the first person, it is sometimes hard to discern whether she is dreaming, delusional, or sane and I found myself having to reread a couple paragraphs to fully understand what was going on. But I suppose Collins did this intentionally for the reader to better understand the duress Katniss was under.    Second- The ending was abrupt and left me wondering, \\"huh...that's it?\\" My initial response was of complete disappointment. I wanted a happy ending. But the more I thought about it, the ending was quite fitting and appropriate for the underlying main message of Collin's series- the ravages of war and how nobody wins when there is merciless fighting. And she clearly points out how some damages are irrevocable, but life does move on. So, the ending was disappointing but appropriate.     Third- There were questions left unanswered. I found there were too many new characters who found just enough attention in the book but who were not fully addressed or explained. Mainly, I expected more information about President Coin and what her true intentions were, who she was working with, etc. But I'm thinking maybe there wasn't an underlying conspiracy with Coin but more of a display of how human nature does not change.     All in all, the book is entertaining and does give an adequate closure to the series. It's just not as thrilling or satisfying as the first two.

B002JVWR9U|5.0|I had my reservations about this series when I started seeing previews for it's first season, in the summer/fall of 2009. I thought it was going to be some Twilight rip-off, or a \\"90210 with vampires\\" type TV program.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong! I fell in love and was drawn into it from the VERY first episode. The characters are well-rounded, the story and plot are completely developed, the acting is perfect, the direction and production are both top quality.<br /><br />I'm sure, just like everything, this show has it's critics, but I honestly cannot find anything wrong with it. I can't wait till the premier of the second season in October 2010, and I look forward to many more seasons of The Vampire Diaries.<br /><br />Anyone who likes coming-of-age dramas, vampire tales, lite romance, or just plain good television, will definately love this show and this DVD set!!
0143118420|3.0|I was disappointed in this book.  I waited months to buy it, \\"do I want to read it?  Do I not?\\"  Now, I say \\"not.\\"  Couldn't believe the gluttonous behavior in Italy.  Nor the extreme Ashram thing (God can be found anywhere and He doesn't require that you sit without moving for 10 hours.)  Ridiculous that people pursue these practices and these scam artists who provide these non-Christian practices.  A dumb, dumb, dumb waste of time.  Go out and volunteer at a homeless shelter or a place for abused women.  You'll find God much faster and do more good.  I could have done without the almost explicit sex with the Brazilian dude.  This book spoiled my wish to see the movie.  I don't really care now.

B000056NX5|5.0|No doubt about it: the 1973 Norman Jewison's production is a very good movie. In Chile, it became a cult movie and ran for more than one year in the opening house. However, this 2001 theatrical revival stands as an excellent example on how to revive a musical in the screen, making it an original, fresh and vital experience. The performers are excellent: Jerome Pradon is great as Judas and Renee Castle as Marie Magdalene equals Yvonne Illman´s dramatism from the Jewison version The updated viewpoint to the story makes total sense and it does not manipulate or change the essence of the original. Photography, art direction and costume designs are first rate, and the music remains superb. An outstanding and spectacular version, different to anything you´ve seen before. Don't miss it!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I have heard people rave about this movie since it came out.<br />Every great director has at least one defining film.<br />Speilberg had....lots of them.

B00095NX9G|5.0|I have many BD DVDs but I like this one best. Rachel, amazing as always, has made a 2 disc DVD that includes easy yoga, an easy to follow exercise routine that is challenging (unless you are in great shape) yet very easy to work with, choreography steps that she builds the other moves onto and two performances, each to very non-typical bellydance music. If you like Rachel's style, and who doesn't, this DVD will certainly teach you how to achieve it. She narrates as well a giving a couple of little lectures. I think a beginner could use this product but having a little BD background would be better. I plan to use this regularly through out the winter months instead of hibernating in front of TV. There is certainly plenty of material to learn.    Highly recommend!

0790729342|5.0|In the barren wastelands of the post-apocalyptic future, one man stands above the rest: his name is Max, the Road Warrior. Introduced originally in the Australian trash and tumble actioner MAD MAX, creator George Miller transports his lead character into an entirely different environment for this second adventure. The world has been ravished by war, and all that remains are roving bands of marauders that scour the roads in search of fuel. Max, a lone warrior, battles his way through the packs of motor gangs with nothing to live for but revenge. His journey leads him to a remote oil refinery, whose leader acquires Max's help in leading his people through the treacherous desert in exchange for fuel. Miller's high-octane action sequences and explosive car chases across the Australian outback have served as a standard model for future filmmakers, with unforgettable scenes that have been copied and stolen repeatedly in the decades following its release. It is THE ROAD WARRIOR's wild costume designs and outrageous characters that set it apart from so many other imitations, especially seen in the frightening, larger-than-life villains Toadie and The Humungus that lead the feral hordes. Relics from the Old World are twisted and reformed to create the misshapen fortresses and gnarled body armor of the future. Although the plot and dialog are noticeably thin, Miller has drawn from the basic story structures used in cultures around the world to create an epic tale of good versus evil set in a futuristic landscape that offers a universal appeal to all viewers. Along with its predecessor, THE ROAD WARRIOR is a must-see film for all action and sci-fi fans, and a staple 1980's classic!<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B001KVZ6FW|1.0|A complete  disappointment!<br />The following has nothing to do with the movie nor the seller but with the information provided on the page.<br />Personally I have noticed as Amazon does not always fully informed about the languages and subtitles available for a film.<br />In fact and very often simply does not show any information, so I assume it is only in English, but in this case was very clear:<br /><br />Language: Français (Dolby Digital 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround), Spanish (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround)<br />Subtitles: French, Spanish.<br /><br />But the movie is only in English and no subtitle at all.<br />I think the company should put more care into these details.<br />I even think that there should be an email option in case of doubt.
B002RWKSII|5.0|How do you review a genius, much less two? The simple answer is...you don't. In the musical arena, you just sit back, listen and enjoy. Of course there will be the professional critics who can't resist mentioning that some 45 years later, Brian's voice isn't what it used to be.(Gee, what a revelation!!)There will be those who will say that this isn't the Brian Wilson that they know and love. Finally, there will be the unspoken majority who just marvel that at age 68, Brian Wilson continues to prove why he is one of the major musical geniuses of the 20th century. Brian, just keep singing.

0307454541|3.0|(!BE AWARE SPOILERS AHEAD!) The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is not the-end-all-be-all that a lot of people are making it out to be and it's certainly not the return of noir fiction that a lot of the critics were yammering about when it was first published. In fact, the book is only average in story and writing.<br /> Girl is on par with a John Grisham novel or a Patricia Cornwell novel in that everything is neat and easy. What I mean by \\"neat and easy\\" is that there is no thinking required in this novel. Everything that happens in the novel is spelled out for the reader. Unlike true detective stories, or the noir fiction of Dashiell Hammett, we are never left guessing that one possible out come is just as possible as another. There's never a zig when we thought we were going to zag.<br /> As disgusting as Girl can be at times, there's rape, mutilation, torture, and promiscuous sex just for good measure, we never really fear that our heroes won't find out the mysteryby the end the novel. Everything is solved by a keystroke or other weak plot devices that border on the absurd. Nothing is ever in question and we never fear what is around the next corner because whatever it is we know that our heroes will make it out alive.<br /> Girl is full of moments that make you scratch your head and pause for a moment. A keystroke reveals the whole mystery in the book, which was obvious early on in the novel. It took the male protagonist, super-reporter Mikael Blomvkist, moments to find clues in a picture that was over 40 years old. It's possible that the police and Henrik Vanger, the patriarch of the Vanger family who set the whole novel in motion, could have over looked obvious clues. However, we are told that both parties had studied everything in detail concerning the case. A few keystrokes later in the novel, after a pathetic set up, reveals that one of the many uncles floating around is...(hold your collective breath)... a serial killer. When I say serial killer I don't mean the Ted Bundy type of serial killer, but the Nazi in jackboots serial killer. When the secret is revealed, to a tied up Blomvkist, it's done in the most stereotypical fashion-the killer reveals everything and more because he has the hero of the story chained up in a chair! It's a corny let-me-tell-you-everything Hollywood ending. All that was missing was a diabolical laugh.<br /> Which only leads to another WTF moment in the novel. If Lisbeth was a computer hacker and all around whiz, why didn't she create a program that made it seem that money was being deposited in the account that Bjurman, her legal guardian in the novel, was in control of while her actual money was being deposited in an account of her choosing? Larsson went out of his way to tell us (another problem with the novel; we are told things, but never shown things) that Lisbeth, heroine extraordinaire, can hack into computers of multi-conglomerates and get away with it. A small program, like the one I mentioned, would be nothing to accomplish.<br /> Another problem with Girl is the girl. In Lisbeth Salander, Larsson has created a heroine on par with Wonder Woman. There's nothing wrong with a strong heroine in a novel. Larsson should be applauded for the attempt, but he goes way beyond the \\"I am woman hear me roar\\" mentality of the women's rights movement. He has created a heroine that can do anything and beat anyone at anything. This makes it hard to write situations that keep the reader in suspense. Lisbeth can literally do anything and beat anyone. Larsson hasn't so much created a strong female character as created demigod.<br /> The movie fares no better, but what can one do when the source material is weak? It doesn't help that the director, Niels Arden Oplev, had made a movie that is almost shot for shot from the book. There's a reason why most books made into movies are tweaked for the screen- not everything in the novel translates well to the big screen. Sometimes a director has to lose, or even add, certain things from a novel so that the movie will have a flow. Oplev does try does his best to ratchet up the creepy factor through flashbacks inspired by David Fincher's Seven. However, it only serves to remind us that the entire movie was doomed from the start.<br /> A lot of people get furious when someone they don't agree with is cast in a movie from their favorite book. Readers were mad when Tom Cruise was cast to play Lestat in Interview with the Vampire. Comic geeks were irate when Christopher Nolan went with Heath Ledger to play Joker. I'm not one of these people. I figure the director knows what's going on with their film. However, I have to make an exception in this case. In the novels, Lisbeth is described as being 24. So, whom does the casting agent decide to go with? That's right, an actress who appears closer to 40 than 24. The bad casting decision shatters any possibility that the Lisbeth Salander character had at being believable.<br /> The book and the movie do little to dispel my already cynical view that both the publishing and movie world cater to the lowest common denominator. However, the American remake may be better than the original. A lot of people won't agree with me because a lot of people subscribe to the bourgeois view point that if it's coming out of Hollywood it will be garbage. Even having Fincher direct the project won't change the minds of these pseudo-intellectuals. I, for one, can't wait to see the American remake. Fincher has directed some of the creepiest and grittiest movies made in the past fifteen years. Hopefully, Fincher will add a level of mystery and suspense that both the book and the original movie are sorely lacking.<br /> Just remember: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is not noir fiction, Stieg Larsson is no Raymond Chandler, and you have better things to do with the two hours it will take to watch the movie.

0439023513|3.0|This book had some very powerful messages, but there was no break from the darkness. It leaves you feeling depressed, confused and unsatisfied. I didn't hate the book, but I think that is only because I loved the other two books so much. If I would have read it on its own I am not sure I would have finished it. I had to keep putting the book down to take a break from it's over all misery. I give it 3 stars, because I still have no idea how I feel about it.
B00005JKNF|4.0|I wish Amazon allowed 4.5 stars.  That would feel more appropriate. Yes this is arguably not quite a great movie, but its certainly a very good, very enjoyable one.  Wonderfully acted by an amazing ensemble cast, and shot with delicate grace,  It may not add up to more than the sum of it's parts, and the murder mystery that takes up the last 30 minutes is more obvious and less graceful than what precedes it.  But its so full of funny and occasionally moving moments, wonderful bits of dialogue, and tremendous texture, that it's lack of a deeper punch, while slightly disappointing, takes little away from a terrific film.
B003JTHESA|1.0|I've been a Dutch Maiden fan since 1979, since the very first album. This album, like the past 4 albums, to me is the end of a great metalband, running out of ideas and charisma. To me, the first 3 albums were the very best, from which Killers topped this top 3. (Also, I'm more of a Paul di'anno fan but Bruce is really great on the number of the beast) The 4,5 and 6th album were okay, from which Piece of mind was great, but after 7th son...something happened. They got tired, tired of writing really original stuff, lost in a circle of repetitions and boring songs. It's so sad. I'm so sorry. I love this band they was they were. But I think, when it's over, you should stop and not end your career while going down. Thanks for the eighties, guys! When I was 12 I saw you guys with Kiss...was hooked immediately.

0930289455|4.0|I was expecting a graphic novel not a dinky little magazine. When I opened the package I felt ripped off. Basically the size is very disappointing. I'm new to the world of graphic novels, so, I'm used to getting a substantial book of sorts, which I've discovered is actually a series combined. Anyway - Decided to read it, and put it back up for resale.... After 30 minutes I put the appropriately named 'novel' right up beside my new collection including Year one and DKR. It manages to immerse you into the world of Gotham, quickly and efficiently. Then without compromise, and quite suddenly show you the true potential of The Joker.    It's a stretch to buy the hardcover in my opinion, unless you're diehard, but the softcover price was well worth the read. Not to mention, the Art is among the best I've seen in my short love affair of Graphic Novels.
B002VKE1K2|3.0|Banking on the added \\"realism\\" of using a home video camera, \\"Paranormal Activity\\" plays out on the screen in a fashion very similar to films such as \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" and \\"Cloverfield.\\"  Much like these two films, the success of this movie relies heavily on the execution of this gimmicky style of filming.<br /><br />The film opens with Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat) fairly settled into their new home.  Micah has purchased a camera in order to capture \\"paranormal\\" events that Katie believes are happening in the house.  She also believes that the \\"activity\\" has actually been following her around since she was around eight years old.  After a few scenes of the couple adjusting to life with the camera, we make it to the first night of Micah's experiment with the camera.  With just a few breaks in between, this is how the majority of the rest of the film plays out.<br /><br />At first, nothing major happens.  The couple catches a door swaying open and shut and catch noises hear and there.  After discussing the events with a psychic (Mark Fredrichs), the couple begin to part ways on Micah's experiments.  The psychic warns the couple that whatever being is in the home with them is quite possibly demonic and that they shouldn't taunt, confront, or open dialogue with the entity.  This only fuels Micah's desire to \\"catch\\" a ghost on camera or make contact with it.  Katie demands that he stop doing this, but Micah insists on continuing his tests.<br /><br />As Micah treads on despite Katie's protests, the events becoming more sinister and scary for the couple.  They call a recommended demonologist to help them, but he is out of town for a few days.  Instead, the psychic returns and immediately flees the home fearing that his presence might actually increase the activities going on in the home.  Who or what is the entity?  What does it want with Katie?  You'll have to check out \\"Paranormal Activity\\" to find out.<br /><br />Before I go any further, I want to say that I enjoyed \\"Paranormal Activity.\\"  It is a much smarter film than \\"Blair Witch\\" and I actually felt sorry for Katie as the events became creepier and more violent.  Micah came off as quite the jerk in the film and had I been Katie I would have shown him the door long before the paranormal activity got bad.  While Micah was a bonehead, he wasn't the type you'd typically find in most horror films.  He wanted to tackle the entity because his ego wouldn't allow him to fail.  Unfortunately, this caused a strain on his relationship with Katie and quite possibly fueled the entity's desire to terrorize them even more.<br /><br />While the characters were decent enough (and not too over-the-top), the film did have a few major lulls in it.  Shows like \\"Ghosthunters\\" and \\"Ghosthunters International\\" leave out the dull hours of footage where nothing happens for a reason:  it's boring.  In this film, perhaps to capture some of the \\"reality\\" of an actual investigation, we often get to see long segments of time where literally nothing happens.<br /><br />As for the investigation techniques, I did appreciate the fact that Peli allowed his characters to utilize cameras, digital voice recorders, and the assistance of a psychic for Micah's tests.  The use of powder to capture foot and/or handprints has also been used in paranormal research and allows for added creepiness in this film.  Peli also stayed par for the course on what supposedly occurs during a demonic haunting event by utilizing the attic of the house, the number of knocks heard during the night, and the disoriented state of Katie at times.  Kudos to Peli for researching the research.<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT***<br />With this praise given, I do have to knock Peli on two things.  First, while many paranormal investigators agree on the dangers of using a Ouija board, I felt that the \\"fire\\" event involving the board took away from the overall authenticity of the film.  Secondly, CGI works good in many films, but killed the ending of this movie for me.  I preferred the alternate ending on the disc.<br />***END SPOILERS***<br /><br />In summary, I applaud this film for attempting to give a very real and authentic look at paranormal research, albeit with just a couple of misteps that took away from the overall quality of the film.  However, much like watching a person tackle a virus on a computer, paranormal research can be very, very boring at times.  This makes \\"Paranormal Activity\\" suffer overall, and therefore I give it three stars.rred the alternate ending on the disc.  ***END SPOILERS***    In summary, I applaud this film for attempting to give a very real and authentic look at paranormal research, albeit with just a couple of misteps that took away from the overall quality of the film.

0439023513|5.0|It's not easy to come up with a fantastic plot and engaging characters, but it's harder still to bring a trilogy to a brilliant end.  Suzanne Collins accomplishes this with her moving and best book in the Hunger Games trilogy.  I finished the book 3 days ago and still can't stop thinking about the characters and about the ongoing theme of the book, which is war and the effects it has on all sides fighting.    Of course, my biggest question when I began Mockingjay was, \\"Will it be Gale or Peeta?\\" and thankfully that question is answered.  But even more beautifully than answering the question, Collins tells us the reason behind Katniss' choice, and that is probably the most genius part of it all.  The story goes from being a tale of one girl's struggle with survival in a brutal world to being more about the effects of the choices we make and the horror of what we become as a civilization when we continue to destroy ourselves.  This theme is incredibly poignant for the times we are living in.  It holds a mirror up to ourselves and you're left wondering what you would do given the same situation that our characters are in.      I truly hope the word gets out on how wonderful and IMPORTANT this trilogy is.  We are, after all, human, and our time on this earth is fleeting the more we work in dissonance with one another.
0525423842|4.0|I am done and tired of novels like James Patterson.   I have read so many of his violent cookie cutter novels, that I am done with him.  What I loved about Grisham is his great story telling abilities.  I think that one can argue over which of his books are great and which ones are lacking.  What I love about him is that he does try to build his characters made of themselves and not built on pure violence.  I don't waht to feel like I am watching a showtime special movie.  I want to feel like I am watching Law and Order.  Of course due to the subject matter there is always going to be some violence, but he doesn't over do it for the show of the book.      With that said I really did like Theodore Boone Kid Lawyer.  I loved his character of working hard, having goals for a career, being excited about something other than video games, excited that his parents and him invested in others and not just themselves.  I am excited that this young man worked hard.  He cared for his family and others and about the law.  As far as excitment goes, I found it just right.  Not every book is going to leave you wanting to stay up all night to finish.  It doesn't mean it isn't good.  I really loved this book and can't wait for the next book.  From the way he wrote this book you can tell it is meant to be set up for a series of storys.  I hope it is successful.!!!

I can honestly say this is the first time in my life that I got drowsy during a movie and even considered leaving. It was toooooo long, too shallow for something that pruportedly had adults looking for real purpose, and too full of people committing without ever committing. Richard from Texas was the only redeeming part, and he wasn't all that. I regret having spent the money and the time.

B002VECM4A|3.0|This means simply that, no matter how hard one tries to delve into the inner workings of another person's mind, it will ultimately prove itself to be a naively valiant but futile effort.  In this movie, a girl who has all the makings of a borderline personality or DID patient, in her odd little oblivion, retreats on occasion to a fantasy land, where she can be a singer, loved by everyone surrounding her, and yet has the ego strength to persevere.  This is certainly admirable in its own way.  Precious's mother can very easily be vilified, and in the end may have evoked sympathy from some people; I can say that the nice little bow they wrapped around her story to explain why she turned into such a feral creature is only the tip of the sunken ship.  Trying to understand it simply from that perspective, I would say that yes, there are Oedipal undertones, there was a defended regression and a concretization of symbolic struggles the mother was clearly facing; in attacking her daughter she was attacking vulnerability, devaluing her was her way of not only identifying with whatever nameless aggressor she had in the past, but it was also a way of self-injury by identifying with the vulnerable, frail individual her daughter represented.  Not much to say about the disdain shown to the mentally challenged child Precious bred, nor about Mariah Carey's inevitably stereotyped role as a bleeding heart who eventually swallowed the mother's primitive push towards becoming another rejecting external object.  Ugh... I think they wanted people to empathize with how this girl overcame the odds to push forth with her life, despite all these horrid adversities facing her.  That works too, but we can't understand her world any better than we can the mother's, and it says something of the viewers' ability to withstand realities that go against their own moral code without bringing out projections of their own.  It's hard to swallow such egregiously vicious personalities without responding with an equal dose of aggression.  But movies are interpretation, and mine is just one more amongst 6 billion.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I would recommend this cooler to anyone with a limited budget.  At 26 degrees Celcius room temperature, my i7-920 at stock speed stays at around 37 degrees, which isn't that good (almost same as stock cooler). HOWEVER, when I use Prime95 to stress my CPU, the load is only around 55 degrees. When I overclock my i7 to around 3.4 Ghz, it stays at 40 degrees idle and around 58 degrees on maximum performance.  Therefore, my conclusion is that while this cooler does not show much performance at low temperatures, its efficiency increases as the temperature goes up.  This cooler sells for around $30, and most people should be enough with this, unless you are going to overclock until your CPU becomes almost fried with extra voltage.  This cooler comes with its own thermal compound. The backplate was a little hard to install because the screws did not go through easily.  For installing an after-market cooler for the first time, it took me around 45 minutes to install.  The dual fan configuration does make a slight difference, but not so significant.  Fits almost any mid-tower case. I had an Antec Nine Hundred case, and this cooler fit in my case with over 5mm clearance from the top of the cooler to the side panel, although it blocked me from installing a side fan.    Another thing to note:  This cooler has a sleeve bearing fan. You CAN install it so that the fans are horizontal, but then the fans will be loud and have reduced performance and life. It is NOT RECOMMENDED to do so.  If you want to do the horizontal setting, either get a new fan with rifle, ball bearing or buy a cooler that comes with a rifle or ball bearing fan, such as Cooler Master V8 (Price: $70)

0812973992|2.0|My book club's selection, \\"Let the Great World Spin\\", promised to live up to its reviews and awards.  I found it a muddle of language with long paragraphs of description (one paragraph that took up half a page consisted entirely of phrases that began \\"Death by....\\")  Some of the characters were appealing, others shallow in both their development and world view.  They all seemed to be haunted by voices from the past--the Park Avenue matron whose grief over her only son's death was poignant but bogged down in detail--petunias, bagels, ashtrays, mezuzzahs, cigarettes).  (This writer should take a page from Hemingway and McCarthy and go for the pithy but succinct simple sentence.)      The writer's idiosyncratic use of punctuation and sentence structure seemed, after a point, just laziness.  The book didn't hold my attention for more than 10 minutes at a time.  After ten minutes, I put it down, annoyed with the lack of continuity and inadequate character development.     I've never been enamored of the glamor and grittiness of New York City.  I'm even less impressed now.  McCann seems better at describing Dublin where we get a definite sense of place and culture.  Lately, I've been 0 for 4 when it comes to new writers.  I hope my choices improve.
0439023513|2.0|This series deserved a better ending and so did it's readers. Our great heroin of the first two FANTASTIC hunger games books does not show her defiant face in this one. She spends a silly amount of time finding and describing hiding places and letting the other characters do the hard work. Similar lame devices- injuries, drugs, etc. are used throughout the entire book to move the story along without the heroin's involvement! She is passive and muddled. There is NO blossoming of her character, so don't hope for it. While there were a lot of really great moments in this book, it was mostly fuel from the first books that had me reading on as quickly as I did to see how Katniss' story would unfold, only to be completely dumbfounded by the abrupt and incomplete ending. The characters get where I would have liked them to, but in lame two page \\"wrap it up\\" ending.  I knew it was coming when I realized I had only a few pages left to read and the story was no where near a proper closing. I'm so disappointed, that in my current state (at 2 AM) I am so miffed, that I would say I might not have read the books at all if I'd known it would end this poorly.
1416550550|5.0|This is my first Kate Morton novel. I loved it. Great location for a story of this type. The map of the estate was a nice touch. The story had complexity and depth. Pathos and joy. Cruelty and cunning. Characters you despise and you grow to love. Once I started there was no stopping. The story grabs you and never lets go. It must also be said that Kate Morton is adept at the well-turned phrase. A fine mystery with a most satisfying denouement. If you have enjoyed Zafon, Eco, Pears, Bronte or Setterfield you will enjoy this novel. Seriously.

Even if you feel that not everything is working as it says in the book, there are enough lessons in it that will make it worth reading.     Personally, it has opened me to a happier, more relaxed and generous life. It has improved my relationships with the people around me, I'm achieving every goal that I set for myself and so much more.

0439023513|5.0|With Mockingjay, Suzanne Collins achieves what few authors ever achieve: each book is an improvement to the previous book, even though this seems hardly possible. once again, you dive right into Katniss world right after the very first sentence. If you thought the world of Panem was a desperate and gloom place before, wit until you read Mockingjay. The brewing rebellion of Catching Fire has become a full blown war. What I´ve always admired about Suzanne Collins as an author is her ability to create such deep, powerful and atmospheric scenes that always captivate you and put you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions. I also loved her use of First Person POV in her whole Trilogy, as all the emotions are even better transported and so much more personal through the eyes of Katniss.     Just like in the previous books, the characters we know change, evolve and grow and not always is the change for the better. It is however in every case masterfully written and skilfully designed by Suzanne Collins.     In the first part of the book, Katniss has to come to term both with her new surroundings and the role the rebels have designed for her. She definetly grows in this book, in every aspect: she grows up even more, grows into her role as Mockingjay (once she accepts it) and face/voice of the rebellion, but as the story goes on, she also grows slightly insane due to all the things she sees, does and has to suffer from. Some might argue that Katniss seems to be cold and unfeeling when it comes to her love interests, but I guess you always have to keep in mind the things she has gone through. No could come out of something like that undamaged.     Especially Gale changes in my opinion more to he negative. His sympathy for the rebels and their cause has always been known, but Mockingjay portrays him as someone who becomes rather ruthless.     I don´t want to give away too much about the story, but as always, it´s gripping, surprising and captivating.     Even though Mockingjayis a Young Adult book, Suzanne Collins is not afraid to picture war with all its cruelties. Also, just like in the previous books, the underlying social criticism and political issues send a message that can´t and should not be forgotten. This book seems to pose the moral question of \\"How far can you go in a war before you become what you fight?\\".     These two aspects however make me doubt the recommendation of th German amazon page, which recommends it to kids from the age of 12.     The end was not how I would have wished it to be but it is nonetheless the fitting and right end for it. It´s not a Happily Ever After, but not as horrible as it could have been.     Real or not real, Mockingjay is the perfect end for a remarkable, astonishing and thouroughly brilliant series? Definetly true. For me, it´s one of one of the best YA series I´ve ever read.
0439023513|5.0|EDITED below to add my comments in response to another review as requested by comments here.<br /><br />The most powerful book in the series, Collins dives straight in to the realities of rebellion and war. At times hard to read, Mockingjay unflinchingly portrays war as it is... characters fighting over how far is to far in war, loss of innocence and innocent lives, knowing which side you are fighting for, along with the role media propaganda plays. Collins set out to tell kids in a way they can understand, the realities of war behind the images we see on TV. She succeeded... and even more so she succeeded without a particular left or right wing slant to the book, which is rare for these types of works. It is dark for YA, but it is also real and in that reality is it's value as a read for teens, who in 5 or less years could be on frontlines themselves.<br /><br />What makes this book so powerful is the characters that Collins creates. Over the course of the 3 books you grow to know and love them, so seeing bad things happen to them, or them make bad decisions or grow apart hurts. But this speaks to the mastery of the work. If it wasn't so good, you wouldn't care so much. In a story about war the relationships will be tested, people will be lost, and yes, people will be broken. It could not have been any different and still be the story about the realities of war that Collins wanted to tell.<br /><br />Highly recommend this entire series.<br /><br />***************** Below my comments in response to Suzanne G's great review (link below): *****************<br />http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R6D1DAM9L0ZF/ref=cm_cd_pg_pg2?ie=UTF8&asin=0439023513&cdForum=Fx229UU4T33F95N&cdPage=2&cdThread=Tx2F3UH15I2LUG3&store=books#wasThisHelpful<br /><br />I think your review is one of the most coherent and thoughtful of the negative reviews, but I still can't bring myself to agree entirely with it.<br /><br />One of the more minor reasons is your use of the phrase \\"anti-war.\\" This book is anything but anti-war. It is clearly laid out in the two preceding books all the reasons there must be a war, that war is the only option. Life in Panem is greatly improved after the war. A true anti-war piece of literature would have found other options besides war, or would have made post war life bleaker as a result of war. I think to reduce the message to \\"anti-war\\" or \\"war is awful\\" cheapens it.<br /><br />Instead this book examines the realities of war, not just that war is awful but things such as the moral relativism that occurs in times of war. Gale's idea for the nut is a great example of this. For me this is where Gale crossed the line, but it could also be equally well argued that the Nut had to be either captured or destroyed for the rebels to ever win the war and since capture was impossible, Gale's plan was the only way to prevent further loss of lives and protect against the Capitol's rule. You can see this as well in the argument of the double bomb when Katniss is questioning Beetee and Gale about \\"playing from the Capitol's handbook\\" (at what point do we become the evil we fight against), but you also see her rationalizing it post-argument and wondering why she is so against it if it can defeat the Capitol. You made a comment about there being too much talk of strategy but I think in the strategy discussions is where you saw so much revealing info about who Katniss was and why, why Coin wasn't the solution, and why Katniss and Gale couldn't be together.<br /><br />The dynamic between Gale and Katniss is so interesting in this book because they have such different perspectives upon entering the war. One of the reasons Katniss is so impotent for part of this book (drugged, hiding, crying) is because she is terrified to make any decision at all. This is well in line with what I would expect of any character who had every decision she made in HG and CF backfire to unintended consequences that only hurt those around her. This puts her in stark contrast to her longtime friend, Gale who is not afraid of making tough decisions but has never had to live with the results of them (until the end of MJ).<br /><br />Gale has had to fight hard for the survival of his family, he has been forced to work in the mines he hates, been beaten and whipped. He has had to watch as the girl he loved fell for another because of the Capitol's games. Yet he has never been given the opportunity to know any Capitol people closely or to truly fight back and likewise has never had to feel the ramifications (particularly as they affect others) of his actions against them.<br /><br />Katniss, on the other hand, has had the opportunity to know what it is like after you kill. She understands the ramifications of her actions. She knows that your actions don't always bring about the intended consequences. She has had the chance to know, and come to care for people in the Capitol, thus humanizing her enemy. You said something about Katniss being in no position to judge Gale, but I never thought she was judging him. She understood his decisions even when she didn't agree with them (and found herself wondering why she didn't agree). I think she would have made the same decisions as Gale had she not had the experiences she had, that led her to understand things Gale could not (such as how it felt having to live with those tough decisions). But she did have those experiences, and having had them she couldn't ignore them.<br /><br />You said in one of your comments that you expected to see the bond between Gale and Katniss, and I think that bond was there in the way they felt comfortable challenging one another (something they had always done and that Katniss didn't do with those who didn't have her trust) and in Gale's knowledge of how Katniss worked. But here is a relationship that was built from day 1 on survival of their families, where they always differed in their extremeness against the Capitol (Gale always being the more vocal, more extreme). And now they are placed in an environment where food and daily survival are a given for their families (who are not actively engaged in the rebellion, and are receiving food and care regardless of if Gale and Katniss provide it), and where the battle against the Capitol is their primary concern. So their reasons for being together are less, and the things that separate them are more noticeable, all their tender moments together are based on past memories, not current feelings. In battle they are partners, because that's what they've always been, partners protecting each others backs. But when Katniss needs someone she seeks out Finnick or Haymitch, because they (having experienced what she has) will get it. Here again is where I think Gale and Katniss were always a tragic love story. Because, if not for Katniss' time in the arena, they may have grown to love each other equally over the years in district 12, but they still couldn't have been together because without the time in the games and the rebellion, Katniss (firm in her decision to never marry or have children) would have never allowed herself to succumb to the love and actually be with Gale.<br /><br />Another complaint of yours, I think, was the treatment of Peeta and that Katniss barely fought for him. One, I think the fact that Peeta was hijacked (while making the book harder to read because it contained less of the tender moments from the previous 2) was what made Katniss truly come to appreciate Peeta. It gave her the opportunity to want the Peeta she had so often taken for granted and we see this in Katniss' feelings as they travel on their mission throughout the Capitol. Two, As far as why she didn't fight harder to get him back... well Katniss wasn't the most emotionally self-aware person. In HG on the train back to 12 she breaks Peeta's heart. And in the beginning of CF we find her wanting to be close with him again but not doing a damn thing about it, although everything in Peeta's nature says hewould have forgiven her. So basically she spends 6 months letting Peeta mope, wanting him and doing nothing until Peeta makes the move to rebuild their relationship. Throughout CF we see her repeatedly pulling from him, because she doesn't think she deserves to have him since she will never fully commit to him (with the exception of the beach scene when she lets herself go but only to try and persuade him to save his life, and only temporarily giving in to her emotions). So no, I don't really find it out of character for her to not fight for him in MJ. I think it is completely her character. She thinks because she has decided on a life without a partner she has no right to fight for him. When hijacked Peeta confronts her about who she really is (you're a piece of work, aren't you\\"), she agrees with his assessment. So as much as she misses and wants the old Peeta who loved her and didn't see her cold, manipulative side, she can't find it within herself to particularly disagree with everything he sees in her now or to fight against that.<br /><br />This too is an interesting aspect of the story for me. Because yes pre-hijack Peeta loved her in a very self-sacrificing way. But what did he truly know of the real Katniss? He had loved her since the first time he saw her, without ever having an actual conversation with her, and by the time he got to know her, he was blinded to her faults by his love for her. Katniss only knew Peeta in terms of his loving her. She recognized his steadiness, and the hope and tenderness he brought to things, but it was always a given, she never sought to be good enough to earn it. Post-hijacking Peeta saw everything about Katniss her good, and her bad. Katniss couldn't take Peeta for granted anymore. So when they \\"grew together\\" IMO they grew to a much deeper love than they could have otherwise experienced.<br /><br />As far as Katniss's decision Peeta or Gale being made in the last 4 pages... to me it was clear from HG on that Peeta was always the choice... She felt things when kissing him she never felt with Gale, any moment of inhibition (sleep medicine, or semi-consiousness, etc) she found herself wanting Peeta, even after she so-called \\"chose\\" Gale in CF she was trying to talk herself out of wanting Peeta. So maybe that wasn't played out in the text officially until the last pages, but it is weaved throughout the books. I think from the moment you read the line referencing the meadow and \\"a place where Peeta's child would be safe\\" it is clear that the book will end with Peeta's child in a meadow. So even if it passed quickly in MJ it's was foreshadowed long before. I've read a lot calling it a \\"default ending\\" because Peeta was the one who came back. And true I don't think she would have ever chased him down. It wasn't her nature to chase a man, or to feel like she deserved a man like Peeta after all she had done.<br /><br />But after a time of healing (\\"slowly I came back to life\\"), and in particular healing alongside Peeta she is ready. I don't think anywhere is it evident that she is dead inside. For me, when she declares she loves Peeta that is her victory, her declaration that the war has ended. Because she never would allow herself to admit to love or have a partner under the Capitol's rule. It meant she had healed enough to allow herself to love and be loved and to have forgiven herself enough to have been deserving of love. She waited 15 more years to have kids because experience taught her that the incoming power may not be better than the old power. And to me I imagine those 15 years as the time it took to rebuild, and fully demolish the arenas and build the memorials (look at how we are 10 years past 9-11 with the memorial still under construction, rebuilding still happening, and the after effects still being fought, I think 15 years is realistic). Dead inside, means no emotions good or bad. Instead, Katniss very realistically has good days and bad days. She says \\"when the bad days come\\" (meaning that there are good days in between). She talks about the terror of being pregnant with her daughter (which is very real for someone having lost so many people she cared about), but she also talks about the joy of holding her daughter in her arms.<br /><br />Anyways, those are just my thoughts. I enjoyed your review and your comments a lot because it made me really examine why I felt the way I did about the book.would have forgiven her.

0786715103|5.0|Author LTGEN Romeo Dallaire has written an extremely moving, yet disturbing, account of his experiences as the Force Commander (FC) of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR).<br /><br />General Dallaire's extremely detailed account of his experiences capture the reader from the outset. He details places, people and events in such a way that the reader can actually envisage themselves as being with the FC, as he took on this immensely daunting task from the outset. His extreme descriptions of countless meetings and dealings with various people gives the reader the sense of the intensity that he felt as he continued to strive to keep things moving forward and attempt to get a sense of stability and put people on the ground in UNAMIR. He details the shortages of almost everything from vehicles and radios, to pencils and cash as he throws himself into this task with energy and absolute commitment. Coupled with this intensity from his side was the problem of getting support and enough people to take his task seriously. The continual slow pace of UNAMIR as it took off, probably gave the impression to all parties in the Rwandan conflict the impression nobody really cares. It also highlights the problem the UN is experiencing with over-stretch in its peace operations as the Department of Peacekeeping Operations attempts to keep pace with the resolutions from the UN Security Council.<br /><br />As the mission established itself, the plane crash that killed the Rwandan and Burundian Presidents act as the catalyst for the events that follow and General Dallaire details in somewhat horrifying and sickening detail, the horror that unfolded. One particularly gruesome account is of the Gikondo massacre; where Polish UNMOS and priests are forced, at gunpoint, to watch while men, women and children were massacred inside the church with machetes. As these internationals begged for the people's lives, they had guns forced into their faces to keep their heads up so they could see the events better.<br /><br />He also describes crossing a pontoon bridge where dead bodies are caught under the bridge and he looks down and sees their dead faces looking up...<br /><br />Romeo Dallaire emerged from UNAMIR with PTSD, he notes that many of the personnel who served with him in UNAMIR were likewise affected by what they experienced and had to confront on a daily basis.<br /><br />I was moved by this book, as it gives an extremely detailed account of one of the most atrocious events in modern history; it details the experiences of one man and his attempt at trying to make a noble cause work. He did achieve many things as FC of UNAMIR, perhaps the intensity of his commitment was to prove his undoing as he continually pushed himself to try and make UNAMIR work and try and bring the plight of Rwanda to the attention of the world.I also related closely to this book as General Dallaire put his mission first and he cites his personal battles with many situations-not accepting the best car in the Mission's vehicle fleet, for fear of giving out the wrong impression, not devoting himself enough to his family and other stressors that we tend to impose on ourselves in high intensity situations.<br /><br />In summary, an extremely well written and detailed account of one of the great tragedies of our time. One that still has many unanswered questions and one whose legacy continues to haunt those who were part of the tragedy. It took Romeo Dallaire seven years before he commenced to write this book. It is a book that needed to be written, because it needs to be read. Good on you, LTGEN Dallaire, well done!e events better.    He also describes crossing a pontoon bridge where dead bodies are caught under the bridge and he looks down and sees their dead faces looking up...    Romeo Dallaire emerged from UNAMIR with PTSD, he notes that many of the personnel who served with him in UNAMIR were likewise affected by what they experienced and had to confront on a daily basis.

B002HJ9PTO|3.0|The microphone had very low volume, on 2 PCs, camcorder & Sony dictation device. The phone and email support was top notch. They sent a replacement right away. The replacement mic was a little better but still low volume, and did not come close to the description in the video with the guy demonstrating it at the beach with a camcorder. I get much better results from a headset mic that cost me $5 less. Would suggest spending a little more for a good lavalier microphone. I didn't expect the best for $20 but expected it to be better. Returned for a refund.
B00004RJ74|4.0|This movie shows how Vampires are supposed to be, unlike that Twilight crap. This is the only Quentin Tarantino written movie that I like. The beginning is a little slow, but it gets a whole lot better. Seth and Richie are two  fugitive brothers on the run from the police. They kidnap Jacob, Scott, and Kate Fuller to smuggle them across the Mexican border. Once they get to a strip club called The Titty Twister, the doors are locked and everything all goes to Hell (literally) The strippers are vampires that feast on the men.

0439023513|5.0|I've thoroughly enjoyed the unflinching, brutal first two books of the Hunger Games series, but even so, I don't think I was quite prepared for how good Mockingjay is, both as a conclusion to the series and a brilliant stand-alone work. Whereas The Hunger Games and Catching Fire touch on themes such as the effects of violence and conflict on the participants, Mockingjay goes a step further, making the explicit connection that's been there all along and making the theme crystal clear: this is a series about the horrors of war, and what it does to all of us, participant and bystander, foe and friend. Mockingjay isn't an easy book, and those expecting even the tense violence of the first two novels may not be prepared for the brutality and cruelty on display here. Indeed, many fans of the series are rebelling against the final book, resenting its pessimism and bleak worldview. It's not a feeling I sympathize with. What drew me to The Hunger Games in the first place was its honestly and unflinching nature, and Mockingjay is a logical conclusion to that process, as the long-brewing rebellion erupts into full civil war and lines are drawn. There's so much here that I loved - the eschewing of the \\"chosen one\\" syndrome among books like these, the refusal to pull punches, the time spent on scar tissue both physical and emotional, the questioning of motives - that I wish I had more people who had read it just so I could have a big roundtable discussion about it. Suffice to say, with Mockingjay, The Hunger Games trilogy becomes one of the best YA series I've had the pleasure to read, and one whose impact can't easily be shrugged away or forgotten. It's not an easy read, but it's an honest one, and that, to me, is what makes it so brilliant.
B003RD5WRI|4.0|Yes, the original soundtrack, which was in ENGLISH, has been REMOVED and a FRENCH-ONLY dub put in its place.  WTF???  I have contacted the distributor and been promised a proper Original Sound version, REPEATEDLY, but none ever arrive.  I can only guess that someone screwed up at the pressing plant and we are the poor dupes who are shelling out good money for a broken product with no recourse for a refund.<br /><br />This would be great if you are deaf and only read French though!  Otherwise PASS, as this is the biggest FUBAR I have ever seen in a movie release to disc.<br /><br />Also, note that the Director's Release, i.e. this one, restores the Frenchman, Eric Serra's, music score, removing Bill Conti's music which was used in the USA release of this movie.  We can debate 'til the cows come home which score is better, but I personally wish they had included BOTH.  This is one of my all time favorite movies, BOTH versions, but this blu-ray release is a disaster not worth bothering with.<br /><br />2010-11-22 EDIT:  After over a year of complaining, and several responses from the distributor on some island off the coast of France, I did receive a re-printed edition of The Big Blue with the ORIGINAL ENGLISH SOUNDTRACK!  Woot!  They just gained THREE STARS!  :-)  (I ought to take off stars for having to spend a year of my life hounding people to make good, but whatever....)  Now, if they would release this in blu-ray with the USA cut as an extra, the one with Bill Conti's music that Luc Besson hates so much, this would warrant the elusive FIVE STAR RATING.  I'm not holding my breath.  I suspect this is as good as it gets.  Just be sure they don't send you one of the original batch with only dubbed French!  ;-)

0439023513|4.0|Plot: As the final installment of the \\"Hunger Games\\" trilogy opens, Katniss, her family and several other major characters from previous books, have been moved to District 13.  Peeta is being held captive in the Capitol by President Snow.  District 12 has been completely destroyed, and now Katniss has a new authority figure to deal with: President Coin of District 13.  As she has all along, she must struggle with being used as a pawn - even though she has power as the \\"Mockingjay\\" she, too, is expendable. As the body count mounts, the lines between friend and foe become blurred to the point where Katniss must question everyone's motive, including Gale's.    This book reminded me of the \\"Deathly Hallows,\\" because so much of it was unrelentingly depressing and so many of the characters I had come to be fond of were brutally killed.  Collins does a great job depicting the high cost of war and the trauma it inflicts. This war was doubly hard because Katniss had to be constantly aware she was being filmed - just like the other two Hunger Games.  And the Hunger Games may have been ended, but Plutarch is already looking ahead to another show to promote. It reminded me of the movie \\"The Truman Show,\\" in which viewers, having watched Jim Carrey's character go through a huge moral dilemma, nonchalantly change the channel for something else to entertain them.    The four stars are not because the book was depressing, but because of other things.  It wasn't that Katniss behaved passively in the book that bothered me, but that she was unconscious or disoriented while so many of the major events were going on.  Also, like many reviewers, I felt like Gale was disposed of kind of abruptly at the end.  I didn't expect him and Katniss to ride off into the sunset together, but the fact that they had a strong bond in the previous books - it seemed odd that she wouldn't eventually forgive him or see his actions in a less harsh light.  After all, she herself made a lot of unpopular decisions which resulted in people dying or hurt.  I wouldn't expect such maturity directly after the victory, but there was no sign of it in the epilogue.  And her mom - she was a heroine in her own way.  What did she take away from the war?
B003QNXPUK|2.0|Received my shield directly from the manufacturer today and spent about an hour just trying to figure out where the many little side pieces go on the iPhone 4.  THERE ARE NO INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE SIDE PIECES PROVIDED WITH THE PRODUCT.  It's a total guessing game as to what pieces go where on the sides of the phone.  The front and back... cake.  Went on smoothly and, once the micro-bubbles go away, I'm sure it'll be fine.  The side pieces are also tough to get off of the backing paper as some of them are tiny -- find someone with good fingernails.    Before you attempt to install the sides yourself -- like the dummy that I was -- go to their website (no links allowed here) and print the diagram they provide.  I only wish I would've seen that BEFORE I flubbed my installation.  My fault?  To some degree.  But I don't usually assume that I have to go to a website to find instructions for stuff I purchase.  I've asked Zagg to consider my case and replace at least the side pieces.  For now, I've used the scrap pieces from the front and back template to cut what I needed for at least the antenna side (which I understand helps with the whole dropped-call issue on the iPhone 4).    Anyway, not a bad product and not a great one either for the money.  They also used USPS to ship in a plastic envelope so my box was crushed as if someone stepped on it a few times.      Grab that diagram before you install the sides!!    UPDATE 9/8/2010: I ended up really hating the \\"rubbery\\" feel of this thing and my fingers were constantly dragging instead of smoothly scrolling, swiping, etc. the screen.  It may repel drills, screws and rockets, but it feels like it should too.  Zagg did offer a full replacement, but I went with another product that I REALLY love -- Search for Power Support USA... really solid products and their crystal clear cover is very smooth and totally invisible.

B001RTSPVY|5.0|In a time when you can download (ie, illegally pirate...) just about anything you see on tv or in the movies or hear on the radio, we start to question how much we truly value a show. If we can watch it whenever we want we kind of start to take it for granted, or at the very least appreciate it less. I have this dilemma with just about any type of media, is it worth paying for it when I can watch it free on youtube? But Breaking Bad had me so totally drawn in that I didn't even ask myself if it would be worth buying. It was, and I did. Vince Gilligan created a universe so real but so unbelievable that you have to see what happens next. Season 2 really picks up the pace and, along with season 3, it's just one \\"I can't believe it\\" moment after another. Just when you think, \\"there's no way they can top that\\", they top that. I just don't know what I'll do in this long wait to season 4. July can't come fast enough.
B001Q8FRMQ|5.0|Like most of my review cohorts, I don't know French.<br /><br />Then again who needs story. The absolute richness of Melody Nelson makes this more than enough for repeated listening. This thick, churning music is the perfect backdrop for Serge Gainsbourg's molasses voice, and the fact that I don't know what he is saying here only focuses me more on what a finely tuned instrument his voice is: both in terms of aural depth, and his ability to pace a narrative.<br /><br />I'll also single out for praise Jean Claude Vannier, who handles the arrangements. His work with guitars and bass to build Melody Nelson's cornerstone is amazing, but the absolute silky richness of the strings here are the real highlight of the album. Only on Elton John's [[ASIN:B001BLSEOG Madman Across the Water]] have I heard a full string section used with such conviction. If you like the arranging here, check out Vannier's [[ASIN:B000HLDF1S L'Enfant Assassin Des Mouches]]<br /><br />Melody Nelson is a touchstone for listeners of \\"other music\\" but this is one of the few times an album matches its reputation.

B000003S5H|5.0|If Portshead and Tricky were the dark, Air was the light. In the mid to late 1990s, these were the three artists who understood the best of electronica was not bleep and beats, but what you did with them.<br /><br />In Air's case, that meant outstanding composition and melody. Air embraced Bacharach and Scott Walker and high end lounge: an entire 1960s asthetic that was dismissed as art in the age of Hendrix and the Doors.<br /><br />Moon Safari is, of course, modern music, full of keyboard blips and techno beats. Air expands the melodies and harmonies of the 1960s music mentioned into long cyber caves. The tracks here, in some cases, work as dance music, but sway, not boom. While stepping, you will not feel the pound, but stop in wonder at the amazing grace of this music.<br /><br />For the head, for the heart, plug this in.

B002ZG999U|2.0|Synopsis<br />A bunch of aging action stars run around fighting each other and blowing things up. Really, I didn't get much more plot out of this.<br /><br />Review<br />The movie starts off with lots of closeups and wiggly camera shots reminiscent of a time before steady cams. Add to that every action movie cliche you can think of, and I'm not really sure if this movie is supposed to be a satire of action movies as a whole, or it Sylvester Stallone is simply trying to relive his glory days.  But either way, it really fell flat on it's face. I really, really wanted to care about the characters, but it I couldn't. Unless you have a desire to see what happens when Jet Li fights Dolph Lundgren, I'd suggest just renting your favorite aging action movies (my choices would be The Transporter and The Die Hard Collection) or watching The Losers if you want a pretty good action movie with spunk.<br /><br />My Recommendation<br />Unless you really miss the good old days of Rocky, I would skip this one and just watch an old favorite. I'm giving it a 2/5 - If it happens to be around, it's OK.
0439023513|3.0|I was excited and anxious to read Mockingjay. I preordered it from amazon.com and my copy arrived early last week. I finally finished reading it Saturday night. Which means, that while I did enjoy most of it, I didn't find it as gripping as the first two.<br /><br />What I appreciated most in the first two books was the adrenaline-pumping action of Katniss's adventures of survival during the Games. Mockingjay lacked so much of that. Katniss didn't get into real action until the last third of the book and then just when it was getting good, Katniss and the reader are left incapacitated and in the dark yet again.<br /><br />I didn't mind how the book ended. Really, it was fine. But I felt like the ending was abrupt. There could have been so much more. Ultimately, I was disappointed with Mockingjay. I didn't feel that the finale lived up to the first two books.

0439023513|3.0|SPOILERS***************SPOILERS*****************SPOILERS<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />S<br />P<br />O<br />I<br />L<br />E<br />R<br />S<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />Okay, on the one hand, I liked this book. Liked it enough that I couldn't stop reading because I NEEDED to know what happened--specifically to Peeta. I also liked what happened in the end...but...well...<br /><br />From the first page of The Hunger Games to the end of Mockingjay, the one thing, the one character that kept me reading was Peeta. I liked Katniss alright, but she wasn't what drew me into the series. Katniss, like many reviews are saying, was a pawn in this awful war. In the first 2 books she acted against the 'control'. She rebelled--which is WHY so many people looked up to her. Which is why they wanted her face to be the seal of their rebellion. It made sense. But here's where I feel Ms. Coillins made a grave mistake in Mockingjay...she eliminated the 'goodness' that had motivated Katniss to move forward even when she didn't want to during the games from her life.<br /><br />True, this whole series has been about fighting oppression and power. About fighting against a government set out to only make their own lives better, and I felt the first 2 books did that nicely. They were so dark, so horrifying, but inside all of that horror there was a spark of light, of sunshine, and that spark was Peeta and Prim--but mostly Peeta since he was there with her to remind her time and time again the type of goodness that was there to save.<br /><br />Peeta represented true goodness, love, compassion. He was what kept Katniss from falling over the edge into total darkness. He was her rock, her friend, and no matter how confused she felt--she loved him, even if she didn't know it yet. The failure in Mockingjay was that, Ms. Collins took that light away from Katniss. There was no goodness anymore, and therefore Katniss lost her own 'personal spark'. Yet, this was never alluded to in the story. We just saw Katniss growing weaker and weaker, and were never given a reason as to why. People are complaining about how 'soft' her character went and I completely agree. But what isn't being talked about is the reason why. The reason is that Ms. Collins all but removed Peeta from this story.<br /><br />I don't know about everyone else, but he was the only bright spot in this entire series for me. Everything was so dark and hopeless--except him. HE was the one the masses clung to. HIS words, HIS light, HIS goodness. He is what made Katniss look so incredible. It was his presence and words that did that. It is my opinion that she could not have risen to the level she was at without him--which is why she fell short in Mockingjay. The dynamic between them and what they accomplished together at both 'Games' was what drove the series for me. It wasn't even so much about the romance--although that DID add another human layer to this story which made it all that much more gut wrenching and true.<br /><br />All across the review boards, message boards, etc...the main thing people mused about was 'Who is Katniss going to choose? Gale or Peeta?' (And really, was there even a doubt as to who it would be? Who it needed to be?) Yet, we get to Mockingjay and the author COMPLETELY obliterated that theme. Sure, we all understand that the war was the main plot, but the HEART of any story is it's characters and their personal journey. Love being one that drives most stories. The love was all but absent here. Sure, we get a resolution, Katniss chooses in the end, but it doesn't FEEL good to the reader. We were given no 'reunion' scene. We were given no 'love-filled' embrace. We were TOLD, 'and this happened.' Not fulfilling. Not in the least. Readers need closure. It doesn't have to be a 'happily ever after' which would have been completely off base for this story. But we need to see that in spite of everything that had happened, everything that the characters have suffered, that it had been worth SOMETHING. That everything they fought for, everything so many people died for, was worth something in the end. I'm disappointed because it wasn't like that. It was more like 'Yes, I finally admitted to myself that Peeta was who I loved, then I had some babies with him because he wanted them.'<br /><br />Why, Suzanne Collins? Why? Why couldn't you let Katniss and Peeta be content afterward? Why couldn't it have ended with Katniss feeling at least somewhat like what they'd suffered had helped in some way. It ended with Katniss sounding just as depressed and unhappy as in the beginning--even though she had a wonderful husband and beautiful kids. I'm just...incredulous, I guess, that there couldn't even be a kernel of hope in the end. We all know this story wasn't a fairytale, and I prepared myself for bleakness. I just never imagined that I would get the ending I wanted (I was actually convinced Peeta would die and I'd be so incredibly mad that I'd throw the book into my fireplace), but that it would have such a sour note that I couldn't even be happy about it. I missed the dynamic between Peeta and Katniss so much. Only twice in the entire book did I feel ANY of that old spark (when he asked her, \\"You're still trying to protect me. Real or not real?\\" and when she kissed him to help him stay sane.) Twice in 400 pages. Characters and their relationship trump any and ALL fighting/gore/death--even in a war story because without that, readers don't care about the outcome of the war! This is where this novel fell short. The character relationships were completely annihilated. Gone.<br /><br />Ok, I guess I've ended my rant. I just feel like she could have ended the book the same, but could have made that hopelessness feeling go away just a little. Because what is life if there is no hope? This novel left the reader feeling empty, drained, and hopeless. Not even being able to care about what happened to those characters we'd grown to love.

006621131X|5.0|I just finished reading Patti Smith's book Just Kids and I loved it so much I just had to share this story.<br /><br />In 1973, my boyfriend was in the band Eightballs, and every Sunday night they shared the bill with the New York Dolls at the Mercer Arts Center in NYC.  I was in college at the time, but I would hop on the bus outside the school gates and take the 2 hour ride into Manhattan, pick up the subway at Port Authority, exit on 4th by the Waverly Theatre, and then walk the 8 blocks or so to the Mercer Arts Center. By then it was nighttime and in the winter it was cold.<br /><br />The night would open with an unknown poet named Patti Smith. She would sit on the floor playing a toy piano and read her poetry and sometimes sing a little diddy.  Her entourage included a woman I thought was her girlfriend.  Patti wore all black and had a beatnik vibe about her.  She was not friendly towards me or my friend Janet who was the girlfriend of the bass player of Eightballs,  (Janet and I are still friends to this day), and quite honestly, we did not extend ourselves towards her. In truth, Patti Smith seemed kind of scary and off limits.  After her set, she would take off, and a band from Long Island called Teenage Lust would do their set complete with red boas and black lingerie.<br /><br />My impression of Patti Smith at the time was that she was a lesbian drug addict.  What I found out from reading her book was that not only was she as straight as an arrow in both drugs, drink, and sexuality, the woman I thought was her lover was actually her sister.<br /><br />Patti Smith's book, Just Kids, is brilliantly written.  As she tells her tale of love and life with Robert Mapplethorpe, I am sorry I didn't take the moment to smile and say hello back in the days of the Mercer Arts Center.  I was 17 at the time, and more interested in dancing and boyfriends, and college life.  I had no idea what was happening in Patti Smith's world which was full of dedication to art and poetry. We really were existing on two completely different planes.  However, our paths did cross, and I am grateful I had a glimpse of her journey firsthand. It turns out that we are both from New Jersey (me, north, she south) and come from close knit and supportive families.<br /><br />Just Kids is truly a love story.  A love story where the leading character is art.  It is beautifully written and heartfelt.  I can still picture Patti Smith so vividly from back then, and after reading her story I feel honored that she opened herself up for all the world to see, hear, and feel.

B0034G4OU4|4.0|I read and loved the book, or more accurately, I bought the audio book and Elizabeth Gilbert read her book to me. From my vantage point on the other side of midlife, I can say that Elizabeth has the same problem a lot of people have, they are in an unhappy relationship and think the problem is the other person. Of course, it never is entirely the other person but usually one doesn't discover this until after the second bad marriage.    Elizabeth chucked everything and went on a journey to herself. If you pay attention to the subtleties of the movie, she begins her enlightenment when it stops being about her and starts being about other people. Richard, who lived up the highway from here until his death recently was certainly a real person and was portrayed in the movie very much like in the book.    The scenes in Bali were spectacular. The miraculous healing potions of Wayan were as described in the book.     When the movie was over, I felt that it was a \\"little too neat\\" in that some of the angst and agonizing were omitted as side plots and not important to the main story but in the book they were very interesting. My companion (another woman who had not read the book) remarked that she was glad it wasn't a \\"love story\\". In my opinion it was a love story about learning to love yourself and open yourself up to life. A lesson we all need to be reminded of.    Do yourself a favor, read the book, see the movie, read her next book. Enjoy!

1594202559|4.0|More Money Than God is one of the top ten best selling investment books on Amazon right now.  Half of the book is a history of the hedge fund industry while the rest of the book looks at their role in the investment world both good and bad.  Although the whole book is written in a narrative style I noticed this pivot about half way through it.    The author spent thousands of hours interviewing some of the top hedge fund players and his hard work shows.  This is the best book I've read on the topic of hedge funds.  It shows you how the industry started out with the first hedge fund created by Alfred Winslow Jones and continues up until the present day, with a penetrating discussion of the financial crisis, and interesting studies of the biggest and most successful hedge fund managers in between, such as George Soros, Michael Steinhardt, Julian Robertson, and Paul Tudor Jones.    Mallaby asserts that hedge funds are not the big villain that people make them out to be.  In contrast with the big banks that had to be bailed out hedge funds did not need to be bailed out in the financial crisis.  Mallaby believes that the best and brightest managers run hedge funds and unlike banks they put the bulk of their own money into the funds themselves so that the managers interests are totally aligned with their investors.  If their investors lose money than they will lose too.    This stands in start contrast to the Wall Street banks which saw management awarded with giant bonuses even after the banks they supposedly were managing went under and even after the trillion dollar government bailout was rushed into law over a terrified and manipulated body politic.    What is more hedge funds - except for the exception of Long-Term Capital Management - are never too big to fail.    If you spend some time reading Mallaby's book you'll get a good idea of the secrets behind the most successful hedge fund managers.  People look at them in awe and think of them as total genius, but one thing worth nothing is that none of them were right all of the time.  All of them had a year or two when they were positioned incorrectly or else made the wrong bet at some time or another - and these are the best of the best.  But what they all had was longevity and perserverance and knew how to take advantage of things when they were right.

A perfect album closing song.
0965773604|5.0|Book was in great condition. A must have for any book reader. The message will always be current. Buying this book was a great way to celebrate Harper Lee's book of 50 years.
B002GY9F9K|4.0|Many better reviews than I can write. This is a fun romp. If you liked Xena, Stargate, Firefly, and/or Farscape(the best of them all) then you will have a great time with this one.      Just want to say it was great to see Bruce Spence again. He was the best part of Mad Max II as the roto-copter pilot. Great work here as the Wizard.
B0012GMY64|5.0|CD in good condition as promised. If you a fan of Andy Williams, this was a CD worth having.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|At 29Mbps, the Blu-ray disc included in this BD/DVD combo plays back very smoothly. I haven't tried the DVD yet, but since I assume most people are getting this for the BD, I can assure you it works perfectly fine. No special features, which isn't a problem unless you really, really want them.
B002N3GD2Q|5.0|This six CD box set is worth every dime.  Morrison at his peak as well as the other band members.
B00003CXA6|3.0|From a movie-making and entertainment perspective this is a pretty good flick, but the portrayals of the Confederates is just plain weak. Robert E. Lee is seen as indecisive and a bit frustrated with the lack of his commanders' abilities to provide him with any useful information about the Union positions while the Union commanders appear to be cool, calm and collected, well-trained and able to make snap decisions. In fact, this imagery is consistent from top to bottom on both sides. The Union troops are all dressed in the same blue uniform and all show that they received good training before embarking on maneuvers. Even the 'deserters' are well-mannered men who fight valiantly. The Confederates, on the other hand, look like a rag-tag assembly of untrained farm boys who know nothing of disciplined fighting. Historically speaking the Confederates wore gray uniforms, but in this movie they wear just about every color under the sun and look more like a mob than an army. I realize that the North won the war and '...to the victors go the spoils...' but this is carrying it a bit too far. In one particular battle scene in the woods at the top of a hill the Union troops are badly outnumbered and are hoping to just hold the South off to give their other units more time in some battles below, but...voila! Here come those hillbillies running up the hill straight into the muzzles of the Union rifles just itching to get shot. Instead of digging in and engaging the Union from a secure position those 'rebs' just kept on running into the spray of bullets and died in droves. After several repeated drives the Union soldiers ran out of ammunition and had to use bayonets. Bayonets against bullets usually means defeat...but not when you're up against F-Troop. The movie is fairly well made and entertaining, but if you're looking for a more factual re-enactment, watch The North and The South.
B002DYKP8S|1.0|An artistic tragedy. Tarantino and Weinstein should be put in prison for what they've done to this masterpiece. First they delayed the release so it wouldn't compete with the garbage Kill Bill franchise.  Then they changed the original subtitles, dumbing down the story for the half-wits who control Miramax. Look for an Asian DVD release if you want to really see this work of genius. And please don't give your entertainment dollars to Quentin or Harvey, remember that they were almost done for, then a million morons paid to see \\"Basterds.\\" Now we have another decade of @*%&! to look forward to from these two hacks.
B001LXIDVS|5.0|The first Back to the Future movie was a funny set piece exploring a modern teenager at large in the 50s. The second explored a dark alternate present. So what do they do for a third? Go back to the old west, of course! LOL<br /><br />This time though, we have a time traveling Doc trapped in the past, and once again his younger self must come to the rescue to get the DeLarien fixed up and ready to go time traveling. In the process Michael J Fox will encounter Indians, ancestors, old time western bullies, and of course help the modern Doc in the old west to find a way to get the time machine up to 88 miles per hour so that they can return to their real time.<br /><br />The movie is light, funny, and fully lives up to its two predecessors. In fact, it might be my favorite of the three. The Doc's latest time machine at the end of the movie is a wonder to behold ... surprising and delightful. Michael J Fox, Christopher Lloyd, and the entire cast of supporting actors are spot on. Mary Steenburgen almost seemed to be typecast back in those days as the love interest of time travelers! LOL (Time after Time)
B003A4IFGY|3.0|What has happened to Tom Petty? Where is the energetic, yet thoughtful, rocker that I've come to love over the last 30 years? In his place is this wannabe Southern bluesman who seems to be putting on a hollow facade. In fact, Petty seems to be more of an actor now than a singer/songwriter. Even the Heartbreakers, who I've long thought to be the best BAND in the rock world today, seem to have had the life sucked out of them, and, consequently, just seem to be going thru the motions. Nowhere is this all more evident than on the exceedingly disappointing MOJO.<br /> Things kick off strongly enough with the rollicking \\"Jefferson Jericho Blues.\\" All wailing harmonica, blistering guitars, tinkling piano and rock solid percussion, the track is crisp and clever, a worthy heir to anything off of, say, SOUTHERN ACCENTS. This blast of energy, however, does not last.<br /> \\"First Flash Of Freedom\\" is a languid jam that seems nothing more than an outtake from 2008's MUDCRUTCH side project. The arrangement is all very spacy and loopy, while the lyrics (\\"Through a town with no name/Across painted hills that/No rich man can claim/Run the wild mustangs/That nothing could tame\\") are basic teen poetry 101. Ugh!<br /> There's a slinky, smooth groove to \\"Running Man's Bible\\" that totally works. Petty's vocal just sails along, cushioned by a relaxed arrangement. Toss in thoughtful lyrics (\\"I don't speak of the times I've nearly died/I don't speak of out lastin' those who are gone\\") and you have one of MOJO's best tracks.<br /> The same can be said for \\"The Trip To Pirate's Cove.\\" All ethereal and subdued, there's a haunted quality to the track that's mesmerizing. However, I can't help but feel that this track would have been even stronger with a female backing vocal (Say, Stevie Nicks, Melissa Etheridge or Rosanne Cash). Very good....but could have been great.<br /> Next up is \\"Candy\\", a cut that just doesn't go anywhere. This is filler at it's most blatant....the arrangement screams \\"demo\\", the vocal is just phoned in, and the lyrics are silly at best, inane at the very worst. One of the main cuts that makes MOJO such a disappointment.<br /> \\"No Reason To Cry\\" is probably MOJO's lovliest track....there's just a loose, liquid grace to the muted arrangement that's downright beguiling. The only real drawback? The vocals. Petty's lead sounds like his best Dylan impression to date, and I can't help but think some hushed female backing vocals ~ think Sharon Celani or Rosemary Butler ~ would have bolstered the cut even more. Still, another one of MOJO's finer moments.<br /> The same cannot be said about \\"I Should Have Known It\\", a bloated, noisy rocker that tries to be hard, but just ends up heavy (and there's a huge difference between the two). Heartbreakers = jam band? I don't think so!<br /> The misses continue with \\"U.S.41.\\" Mind you, I love the arrangement, instrumentation and lyrics ~ picture backwoods psychobilly! ~ but WHAT is with the Adam Sandler-esque lead vocal?!? To say that it completely jettison's the track is a total understatement.<br /> And then there's \\"Takin' My Time\\"....man, does he ever! This wannabe blues rocker just plods along, dragging on for what seems like forever. Petty's vocal is almost pained, while the instrumentation is uninspired and limp (Oh, O.K., I DO like the harmonica!). Another one of MOJO's less than stellar moments.<br /> It's the exact opposite with \\"Let Yourself Go.\\" This jazzy toe-tapper is, without a doubt, the album's catchiest number. However, as good as it is, I can't help but wonder what would have happened if Petty had followed his own advice and REALLY let himself go. A nice rocker that should have been a real rave-up, this is another really good track that could have been a great one.<br /> The same can't be said for \\"Don't Pull Me Over.\\" Where do I begin??? The faux reggae beat? The rediculous lyrics?? The insipid lead vocal??? This track is not only the nadir of MOJO, it could very well be the lowestpoint of Petty's career. I can't BELIEVE this is a Tom Petty song!<br /> \\"Lover's Touch\\" is the only time when this new desire to be an old bluesman really works...the track has a smooth, slinky vibe to it, while Petty's vocal is right in the pocket. Special mention also has to be made of Mike Campbell's stunning guitar playing on the cut, some of his best to date!<br /> \\"High In The Morning\\" is one of those cuts where it all comes together....a relaxed lead vocal, tight arrangement and smart lyrics (\\"Boy that power belongs to the devil/Better leave that power alone/Could be the devil gonna want it for his own\\") all meld together into an undeniable groove.<br /> Next up is \\"Something Good Coming\\", the disc's most honest, naked, REAL cut. This is Petty stripped of all the masks, attitudes or affectations...this is just a great singer telling a great story with some great lyrics and instrumentation. Sheer perfection!<br /> If only they had ended things on this high note. Instead, things wrap up with the overly dramatic \\"Good Enough.\\" It's not that it's a BAD cut...it's an O.K. album cut, decent enough filler, but as the album's closer? Nope, no way. Yet another misstep.<br /> And I hate to say it, but that's what the majority of MOJO is....one big misstep. I've loved Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers for over 30 years now, and while I'm all for trying new things (I'm one of the few people who look forward to new material at concerts!), I just don't recognize this group anymore. Here's hoping we can reverse this trend, or I may be doing something I NEVER thought I'd ever do....dropping Tom Petty from my automatic \\"Must Buy\\" list.

B003JTHESA|5.0|The Final Frontier grows on you as is typical of the last few Maiden discs. For the record, I think Matter of Life and Death is right up there with Number o Beast and Powerslave. This new one  ranks closer to Seventh Son, Somewhere In Time and Dance of Death. Solid discs all, but not perfect like the top 3 mentioned earlier. I'm not afraid to say when an Iron Maiden album sucks, ex. No Prayer and Virtual XI. Final Frontier is solid Maiden. Its your loss if you can't get into it.
1594202559|5.0|As hedge funds increase in size, variety and number, they also exercise growing power over central banks and national governments, as well as companies and industries. Unfettered by a fixed investment philosophy, hedge fund managers bank on the flexibility to buy assets and sell them short as dynamic markets dictate. Some hedge funds have succeeded spectacularly and some have failed, such as those holding too many mortgage securities when the U.S. housing industry collapsed in 2007. But over its history, the hedge fund industry's performance has been remarkably good. Here, business journalist Sebastian Mallaby forcefully argues that hedge funds contribute to economic stability by chasing the true value of mispriced assets. His richly detailed book centers on the successes and occasional missteps of famous hedge fund managers, including such luminaries as Stanley Druckenmiller, Paul Tudor Jones II, Michael Steinhardt, Julian Robertson and George Soros. getAbstract recommends this book as a vivid introduction to hedge funds for those who are unfamiliar with them, and as a valuable, often entertaining, reference for financial professionals. And if you want to know even more, read the illuminating footnotes.

030745455X|5.0|All three books in this series make exceptionally fine reading. It is a unique work in that the main character, Lisbeth Salander, upon which the book(s)is written, is unique: a brilliant/genius young woman who is a seriously flawed person. She is one who gets into life-and-death problems by being her own worst enemy. She is almost totally misunderstood by society, yet has found a small buy loyal following of influential friends who use their combined powers to bring about justice for this child/woman who has aggrieviously been abused and misused since the age of 13, when she became a focus of the government misabuse, when she set her father on fire in an attempt to murder him. She was driven to this because he had been hittin her mother until she was finally intutionalized with brain trauma. Micheal Bloomkvist is her main support and loyal friend. He has a problem, in that she has tried to expel him from her life and he doesn't know why.<br /><br />This is probably the last book in this series because the author has died. However, there is a rumor that he left a fourth unpublished book that we may one day get to read. The existing three books are a \\"sit-on-the-edge-of-your chair\\" suspenseful mystery. It is also a book about a brilliant woman, who probably has some form of autism. In many ways, the cards are all stacked against her, yet her redemption comes through the acts of people who she has touched and love her, often despite a lack of reciprocation on her part. This is a facinating study in humanity and society as well as an excellent mystery that pushes all the right buttons. Enjoy!
0743455967|5.0|This was an incredible book, a piece of literature that any self proclaimed bookworm cannot miss! I would wake up early in the morning, shower quickly and try to squeeze at least extra thirty minutes of reading and then think about it at work, read during lunch and pick it up right after. This is perfect for people who love to read, yes I said it, if you love reading then please read this, it will give you the tools on how to read better. Also I would recommend it to anyone who wants to write, people enamored with the idea of having a book out with their name on it or simply those who like to scribble mad stories in their journals late at night, hats off to you and make sure you read this piece of a gem before you begin, it's an endless pool of inspiration and motivation.     The beginning is an introduction into King's life, bits and pieces of information that help us see who he is, what he is about, about the gift of writing that he brings from his soul out into the world, I loved this little book and love his stories even more, anything written by this intelligent, kind man has been well enjoyed by yours truly. This is a part self memoir and huge bite of a writing knowledge sarcophagi ala amuse bouche (bite-sized hors d'aeuvre of literature) meaning a tasty bite that hits you with all its magic and knowledge, this was a real treat, especially from someone as talented as Stephen King. All the authors that I have met always recommend this, and I have to agree, it's a real treasure to have on ones shelf.  I have really enjoyed reading it and will be re-reading it many, many times in the future.    - Kasia S.
0470601787|5.0|David Sibbet's Visual Meetings is a wonderful resource filled with great ideas and very practical suggestions. David cites examples of situations and links them to the skills he teaches and creates. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn more about human interaction, systems thinking, creative problem solving, and graphic recording. It is amazing!!
0439023513|5.0|A great unexpected finish to the trilogy. It strips away expectations and leaves you with a grasp of the reality and consequences of war. It vaguely resembles some great war stories that I love like [[ASIN:006185414X The Bronze Horseman]] trilogy in depicting what war actually entails and also jeopardizes.<br /><br />While some may feel like it moved from the popular genre to plain preachy, I'd rather see it as Collins making a choice to stay true to what war really is all about instead of painting in vague grays and glitters that make light of the hardships people actually encounter after war. In this sense, it may have moved further from the young reader genre and closer to general fiction so people expecting light fluffy romance will probably be disheartened. As a whole though, I think I love the book even more in this new light.
0439023513|1.0|I looked forward to this book for so long and it was a HUGE disappointment!<br /><br />I ended up hating all the characters and didn't care about them at all, nor to what happened to them.<br /><br />What happened?  If I wanted a a sad, pathetic, no hero story, I would watch an Obama news conference.<br /><br />This sucks. I am so sad.  I wanted a conclusion I could root for, be excited about, and love.<br /><br />What I got was a bad taste in my mouth and an empty place where Katniss, Peeta, and gale should be.
0439023513|4.0|I finished the finale to the Hunger Games series feeling slightly lost... I fully blame that feeling on my own expectations for the conclusion, not on the wonderful writing of Suzanne Collins.<br /><br />She brought her saga to a close in a completely logical and realistic way, yet after all that Katniss and Peeta had been through I think that everyone was rooting for them to have a happy, peaceful ending at last. Collins makes brilliant points about human nature and the corruption of power, and we wouldn't be in Panem if the series ended with our heroes riding off on a unicorn into a cloud of sparkles.<br /><br />(spoiler alert!)<br /><br />My issue with the third novel is this: The main plot device used in all 3 books was essentially the same. Katniss and Peeta survive the arena in the first novel only to be sent back in the Quarter Quell. At first I was turned off to the idea, but reading and meeting the victors from the other districts was completely addictive. I was also eager to get a further taste of the relationships cultivated in the first book, between Katniss and Peeta and Katniss and Gale.<br /><br />When \\"Mockingjay\\" begins, Katniss has been rescued from the arena and taken to District 13, which everyone believed destroyed. She is then persuaded to continue her role as the mockingjay, or the symbol of the revolution. Peeta has been captured and is being held in the Capitol, and Katniss has suffered a mental breakdown. This causes her to trust in her own judgement of reality, and the goals of the rebellion never quite ring true. By the time Peeta is finally rescued, it has become clear that the Capitol has tortured and brainwashed him, and all of his memories of Katniss have been tampered with. He is now a danger to her and to himself, and anything but an asset to the rebel cause.<br /><br />The rebels gear up for one last assault on the Capitol, which itself has been designed liked a Hunger Games arena as a defense. For the third time, our heroes are forced to deal with traps, muttations and never know exactly who they should trust. This time, however, the romance subplot (which softens up the harshness of reality in Panem) is missing until the very end.<br /><br />In addition, Katniss is forced to watch her sister, who she tried to save by going to the Games in the first book, die at the hands of another power-hungry government. To the observer, it feels that her journey was for nothing.<br /><br />Though I was ultimately disappointed in the end of the series, Collins remained true to her characters and the world that she created, in which there are no \\"happy endings,\\" only learning to be happy with the peace that you can find for yourself.d never know exactly who they should trust.

0670021652|1.0|I hated EPL.  Did not get at all how that book became such a world wide phenomenon. The woman bores me, frankly. And the only reason I am reading Committed is because I found it at a church book sale for 50 centimes.  About 40 centimes too much as far as I can tell after 50 pages.  Just as dreary as EPL.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I was really looking forward to Mockingjay, maybe too much so, because I was disapointed.  It was really not as good as the first two books.  It was extremely violent.  It did not give you as much information/insight on the new characters.  The characters simply were not developed as well as the first two novels.  The book seemed a bit rushed to get to a conclusion.  I recommend reading it just to get to the conclusion of the trilogy but don't expect the same quality as in the first two.

0451205766|5.0|by Emily Placido, author of [[ASIN:1450027881 Julita's Sands: A Memoir]]<br /><br />I read this powerful book many years after seeing the film.  The movie is one of my favorites and I was leery about reading the book after loving the movie so much. I was not disappointed!  This book is absolutely terrific!! It takes the reader from the beginning of the Corleone Saga when Vito leaves Sicily and comes to America.  The story weaves together the two stories from the films, The Godfather, and The Godfather 11, with much more detail. There are things explained in the book that are not quite fleshed out in the movie, like where the name Genco Oil came from, and intimate details about Sonny. There are parts that aren't even mentioned in any of the movies, but that are important to the storyline. Mario Puzo's writing is real, down to earth, typical Italian American speech patterns. It is easy to read and keeps you  glued to the pages. MAfia stories are always a hit but this one is the biggest hit of them all!
B001GCUER0|5.0|Mad Men picks up in season 2 with Peggy managing to keep the birth of her child a secret from the office. This seems unlikely in such a gossipy place but I'm willing to suspend disbelief. Also, we learn more about the whole Don?Dick switch... I'm not sure I can suspend belief THAT much, to where I could believe that the Army wouldn't catch Draper's attempt to trade places with an officer he met. I mean, no one checked his records? Draper didn't know that his new identity is married?<br /><br />Nevertheless, the production values remain high and as escapist entertainment you would be hard-pressed to find anything better.
B002ZG9968|4.0|Great little movie for an hour and a half of simple fun. We shouldn't expect much more from a romantic comedy, and this is exactly what this one is. Two likable characters (he more than her) work on forming a couple facing the complication of a previous pregnancy by artificial insemination. It is a pity too many cuts were made which make the story feel choppy and the time line strange. But you can perfectly enjoy an obviuosly independent woman falling for the nicest (and most beautiful) guy ever, and a whole troop of great supporting characters helping (or not so much) in various funny ways.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I never watched this program before I got this set on DVD. I have to say that I am very pleased with it, although this isn't the kind of show I normally like. The opening scene of the first episode really served to hook me.<br /><br />The program is set in the early 1960s in Sterling Cooper, an advertising agency on Madison Avenue. The lead character is Don Draper, an executive and idea man who works at the agency. He has issues, as we find out further and further along in the series. Indeed, is he even who he says he is?<br /><br />The acting, writing and direction is excellent. I look forward to seeing more shows in this series.
0316044695|4.0|Before making my own review of this book, I glanced through a few previous reviews, and it seems everyone has arguments over this book over some reason or another. As a civilian, and currently in a relationship with a Navy man myself, I completely respect what these men (and women!) do for us and feel honored they put their lives on the line so that we may keep on living the freedom this country has fought so hard to win - and continues to fight for. True, Marcus's book was at times shocking - contemplating the lives of unarmed civilians, the way he kept blaming liberal media, etc. I managed to ignore his personal opinions and issues and kept focused on his mission and his struggle to get out of there alive. I loved this book - it was heart wrenching and it gave the reader an inside look as to what our military does to get the job done. While some parts of the book were a little too opinionated for my taste, I'm still extremely proud of our men and women who fight for our freedom and this book is just one example of that.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0557392233 The Last Saint]]
B002ZG977Y|1.0|In short 1981 was a romance/adventure story with real character development, whereas 2010 is nothing more than a cheap action flick watched once and quickly forgotten.     The Amazon Reviewer, Robert Horton, discredits the original 1981 version in many ways during his \\"comparison\\" of these films. The 2010 remake shows its lack of respect for the 1981 version quite clearly within the first twenty minutes when Perseus looks through the \\"trash\\" of old equipment and pulls out a replica of the 1981 golden owl and the head of the expedition tells him to just leave it. The golden owl is then tossed back into the crate like a piece of garbage, so was the great story and characters of the 1981 version.    The 2010 version harvests all the action sequences of the original and throws them together one right after the other non-stop with no breaks to really tell a story or advance character development. In this 3D state of the art film, the characters are left with all the depth of 1D stick-figures - especially compared to the 1981 version where their leads are fleshed out - even the golden owl of 1981 has more personality than 2010's Perseus.     My rec: rent this one then buy the 1981 version.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Great quality, shipped rapidly and am very pleased with the service.  I have ordered other dvds from other sellers and had to send them back because there was no image or it was defected.  I am very thrilled with the quality.  Thank you.
0439023513|4.0|Somehow it seems that this book was so much more draining that the first two.  When you think about it, in a world where The Hunger Games exist it only make sense that war would be even worse, but I still expected a bit more hope.       I will say that there seemed to be a fast tying up after one very important event near the end of the book and I wasn't all too sure if some of the ending fit the characters we watched grow so much in books one and two...    After three books, I'm still asking...what is the rest of the world like in Suzanne Collins' world?  Still seems so obvious that this is a small country for this to all take place in and I want desperately to know what else is out there...
B003TEO3EI|5.0|BG has exceeded expectations with EOT. They have pushed the envelope with writing, sound production, and innovation; yet have managed to capture the essence of all of their greatest work. Amazing!     I am currently awed by \\"Curse My Name\\" (Reminds me of a cross between \\"A Past and Future Secret\\" and \\"The Script for My Requiem\\", musically). This song forces you to learn the words and sing along. The vocals and percussion are indescribably magnificent. This song will be a crowd favorite, and I cannot wait to hear it live.    \\"Tanelorn\\", \\"Ride Into Obsession\\", \\"Valkyries\\", and \\"A Voice In the Dark\\", punch you in the face like BG tracks of yore. They just don't let up.    \\"Road of No Release\\" has become one of my favorite tracks and \\"War of the Thrones\\" is absolutely incredible.     \\"Sacred Worlds\\" and \\"Wheel of Time\\" have high production value and song length. I have left one of the songs off the list because I tend to skip over it, because I'm having trouble identifying with it.     This album has become my favorite in the BG catalog (over Imaginations...), and I can only hope that they continue to put out albums like this for the next twenty years. Honestly, I have become a bigger fan of Demons and Wizards due to the last release of BG. Thanks to Hansai and the gang for putting out this album. Absolutely AMAZING!
1438509480|3.0|I am looking for a review on the 2009 edition not the 2002 edition by Hays.  The reviews on the page of the 2009 edition relate to the 2002 edition.  This includes the offical Amazon review.     Any input on the 2009 edition?
0439023513|5.0|SPOILERS    This a gorgeous book. It's heartbreaking and depressing and leaves you unsatisfied, but it's gorgeous.    It turned out just the way I didn't want it to and you may be wondering why I gave it five stars. I gave it five stars because it fits. It fits perfectly into the first two books. The whole series is one big war story and I expected it to be emotionally realistic (I got what I expected), and the ending was so melancholy and bittersweet. Katniss is broken. She has lost almost everything. Her father, her home, her best friend, her sister... But she hasn't lost the one person she truly needs. Peeta. Now I DO NOT like Peeta. At all. But if you read the series over, you realize that personal opinions don't really count. The story ends how it should.    Hopeless, bittersweet and depressing. Disappointing. I loved it.    But I'm a bit of a masochist.
B001993Y3G|3.0|An excellent movie, it has all the ingredients a blockbuster film should have and holds up well to date. I am sure a better job could have been done restoring the movie but overall there was no grain in the print. Costner owns this movie in every sense. I don't really need the Brit accent to be sold on Robin Hood film as long as it captures the spirit of the story. You hardly see fun blockbusters like this anymore. The film also holds some fond memories for me so that works as a bonus. It has good making of features one which includes Pierce Brosnan. While I certainly love Ridley Scott's version of Robin Hood it really didn't have a fun/rouge like feeling.
