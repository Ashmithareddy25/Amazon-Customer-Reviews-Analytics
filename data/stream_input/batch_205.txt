B00005TT77|5.0|I have been anxiously awaiting this soundtrack, and it met every one of my expectations.  Howie Day's cover of &quot;Help&quot; was incredible.  He is so talented!  Sarah McLachlan also did a beautiful cover of Blackbird.  The other performers were also great!  This is definitely a soundtrack worth purchasing, especially for Beatles fans.  The artists, without a doubt, do the Beatles justice.
B00005ASOC|5.0|Finding Forrester is a story of friendship of two very<BR>different people where they growed and changed for<BR>the better because of this friendship. The plot is not<BR>unfamiliar (reminded me of &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot; and<BR>&quot;Scent of a Woman&quot;), yet it was presented well, <BR>with gentle humour inserted at the right moment. <BR>The newcomer Rob Brown acted his role very well. <BR>I recommended this movie if you want an easy, entertaining, <BR>and fun movie.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I thought this was a great, great album. I bought it right after I got my new CD player, while traveling to an aunts for Thanksgiving. With all my CD's at home, and nothing to do in the car, so I listened to this CD 20 or so times, without gettting sick of it. You know a CD is really great when you can do that.<BR>     This CD is great because while the tracks differ, not so much so that it wrecks her style.<BR>    By the way, the other reviews for this CD puzzled me. You seem to be saying &quot;well I liked her first, so you dont REALLY like her!&quot; Well, if you like Shakira, which I have never said incorrectly, then you would be happy for all her success. Ok? So dont say us Americans can't like her beacuse we just found her. I think you should be happy that she is gaining more fans.<BR>Like we learned in 1st grade- Share.
B00005RHGK|4.0|Ok,  whew, what a load off my shoulders!  After hearing SO many bad reviews from critics and other reviewers I put off waiting to see this in the theatre and just decided to wait for it to come to DVD.  Thats the last time I will listen to anyone elses reviews.  The movie, though not perfect, is still JUST as good as your regular scream flick like House on Haunted Hill, Halloween, or any other slasher.  I honestly didnt find anything wrong with the acting or the special effects.  You know what it did remind me of, (for all you film buffs), is Duel.  Y'know that old movie of that big rig following this guy around and he cant figure out why the thing is following him or how to stop him.  This reminded me of that.  Oh sure, in this case the thing is a monster who hacks people up and uses the parts he takes to further his own existence, but hey, Duel comes ....sorta close.<br />In any case.  Heck, rent it and say I'm not right. There are some holes in the plot like why does every 23 years for 23 days does this thing come out and feed.  If it can fly, why does it need a truck to chase people.  Seriously folks, if you are mad at little inconsistencys like that with all the action and suspense that is going on you shouldnt be even watching this.  This is just a good ol fashioned slasher horror with some flaws but DEFINATELY not enough to make it unenjoyable!
B00005TT77|5.0|Many great Beatle songs re-done by current stars without losing original character and charm! Great CD!
B00004YW6I|3.0|I've been a huge fan of PJ since &quot;Dry&quot;. I admit, I like her earlier stuff better, but I still have so much faith in PJ as a musician that I continue to buy each new album.<BR>  &quot;Stories...&quot; is a pleasant piece of work. My biggest gripe is the way it was produced. The recording/mixing doesn't do much for the rock songs, in fact I think it takes a lot away from it. I wouldn't doubt that this album sounds 10 times better live. The music barely eeks out my stereo speakers. <BR>  My favorite songs are 'One Line' and 'Horses in My Dreams'. They encompass the elements of PJ's new style that I like; the tunes are beautiful, melodic, inspiring, and heavy. The other songs are interesting at best. They don't evoke much of a response from me.<BR>  Despite the good reviews that &quot;Stories..&quot; got, I can't bring myself to say it's a great album. PJ is without a doubt a great musician and songwriter. I don't consider this her best work. If you want to turn on to PJ's best musical achievements you should check out the earlier stuff.
B00005RYLE|5.0|Just in from Anchor Bay are the final specs for their brand-spankin'-new special edition of Sam Raimi's cult classic The Evil Dead. Not one but two versions will be released on 3/5. The standard edition features a new 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer, English Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround EX and DTS 6.1 ES mixes, a French 5.1 Dolby Digital dub, audio commentary with Raimi and producer Rob Tapert and a second commentary with star Bruce Campbell, outtakes and deleted scenes, still gallery, trailers, and TV spots. <br />The full-on \\"Book Of The Dead\\" special deluxe edition is a two-disc set with all of the same features as above, plus a second disc with the all-new 26-minute documentary \\"Fanalysis\\" by Bruce Campbell and \\"Discovering Evil Dead\\" featurette, plus \\"Within The Woods,\\" the original \\"Evil Dead\\" short film that started it all.
0451457994|4.0|I promised myself that I would read this book before the end of 2001, and I did.  I enjoy reading books set at specific dates in the future to see how much the author got right.  The worst I can say about Clarke's vision of 2001 is that he failed to foresee the downfall of the USSR (even the CIA was unable to do that).  OK, so he sees us as having regular flights to the Moon and a colony on the Moon.  We have the technology to do so today--we just do not have the collective political will.  Many of his predictions, however, feel right, even if they are not dead on.  He has some great ideas for how to overcome the challenges of space, especially the lack of gravity (great when you realize that we had not yet flown a man to the moon when the book was first published).  For instance, he describes a space toilet that spins to create an artificial gravity using centrifugal force so that you can get your business to fall in the right place (makes me wonder what the Shuttle astronauts do now).  <br />Aside from all the predicting-the-future stuff, it is a great story, some premium science-fiction.  I was completely swept up by the idea that some extra-terrestrial life monkeyed (so to speak) with our species millions of years ago to start us down the road to intelligent life--and then set up a signaling device to let them know when we had arrived (the monolith on the Moon, for those of you who remember the movie).  Clarke also does an excellent job of describing what it must be like to travel within our own solar system for the first time--the feeling of leaving our sun, our life-giver behind.  And speaking of the movie, the book explains a lot that you do not quite get in the movie, so that is a bonus.  It also raises some other questions not presented in the movie at all.  While each stands alone as its own piece of work, the book and the movie really should be considered companion works.<br />I removed a star from my rating because this book never reaches the depth and complexity of truely great science fiction.  It just scratches the surface of a deeper story that you know is there.  I assume that the sequels explore these themes more completely.  Further, while the conflict between David Bowman and HAL is what most people remember from the movie, it actually plays a smaller role in the book, to the point where I did not get the sense of menace from HAL that I remember feeling from the movie.  I actually felt sorry for HAL.<br />Overall, though, a great book, and this edition has an entertaining memoir of Stanley Kubrick, his partner in making the film.
B00005QZWI|3.0|Works well in the movie, but listening to the soundtrack doesn't take you back to those scenes as it's playing.  Worth keeping around for something to listen to while relaxing in a hot bath, reading the book, and sipping a glass of wine.
B00003CXZ4|3.0|Telling the story backwards is a clever device, but the payoff once you get to the &quot;ending&quot; just isn't there.  When you find out what this movie is all about, you will feel somewhat disappointed.  If it was told forward in a normal forward fashion, it would be just another shlocky Sunday afternoon TV flick.<br />An intriguing and worthwhile movie, but it doesn't deserve the hype.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|This has got to be my most prized possesion of all time. And it's only a cd you say. Yeah, Right! I love dance, french, latin, rap and many more topics of music. I have to say Moulin Rouge has all of them. I crave David Bowie's song Nature Boy and I love to death Lady Marmalade by Pink, Lil Kim, Mya, and Christina Aguiera. Diamond Dogs by Beck is defientely a must. These are just few of the 15 songs on the soundtrack to a truly heart warming movie. I promise you, you will not be disappointed in this cd. It's got everything. I even bought the cd before I saw the movie which made the movie even more excellent. So if your looking for a good cd to bring on a plane than Moulin Rouge is the one for you!
B00005TT77|4.0|Nearly the whole Cd being Beatles covers, this album satisfies any age. The first time listening to the songs you enjoy just the mere fact of hearing the difference in the original recordings vs the remakes by an eclectic group of artists. For the younger generation there are many favorites such as a surprising sarah mclachlan who is taking a break from music at the moment, eddie vedder of pearl jam, the black crowes, and my favorite ben harper. This is one of those CD's that you can pop in and just listen to the whole thing without skipping a song. The CD is very mellow and mostly acoustic. For any Beatles fan, it isnt quit the Beatles harmonizing vocal sound but there are sure plenty of great covers on this CD and you should be overly satisfied. I would recomend, one of the better CD's I have bought in a while.
B00005RYKU|5.0|The movie is a wonderful thriller, not a dim witted slasher movie.  Thus the movie is well worth watching.  The story proceeds nicely with intelligible dangers.  It is obvious that the producers avoided dumb slasher contrivances.  The movie set ups are very good.  And the acting is excellent.  In particular the cast was led by Leelee Sobieski, one of the most beautiful and consistently talented actresses on the scene today.  I think the negative reviews come from individuals who have become jaded and insensitive to beauty and taste.
0064407667|4.0|It is a decent children's book, maybe exceptional given our feel good society and how this book counter balances that, for maybe 4th through 7th graders. It gave, what is really an old stereo-type, that actors are a bunch of drunken no good scabs.  Why we worship them the way we do, one wonders.  Maybe this book is a good remedy.  It has some good vocabulary, improving vocabulary is the only proven method of increasing one's IQ. The book gives men/boys the lesser of the admirable traits a character might have, and almost all the bad ones.  Although it turns an androgynous (man/woman) creature into a villian, yahoo. One gets the feel, in the end, that men should be men and women should be women, and smell and dress different.  So okay.  The one thing I did not like is that it makes good and evil too clearly defined, thus unrealistic.  Evil is typically people who think they are doing good but in fact are misguided evil people, which includes about 95% of the world's population.  Count Olaf is just pure evil. But evil is rarely so distinguishable, and even Count Olaf would probably say, without qualms, that he was evil.  I doubt Hitler or Rev. Al Sharpton would be willing enough to do that, in fact they would probably say they were good people.  So, the book is a good worthy punch in the face. Realistic? No. Evil is more evil than count Olaf kids, it is often disguised as good people who even think they are good. Watch out.
B0000029AL|5.0|Good evening people welcome to the show!  Aerosmith's first album truly is incredible.  It seems almost obvious now, upon listening to the album, that such an incredible career would be started off with such and incredible album.  THe thing about this album is, if you haven't listened to it before, you may as well be listening to new Aerosmith, because this stuff is never played on the radio.  Classics like &quot;Dream On&quot; and &quot;Mama Kin&quot; are just that, classic.  But what about &quot;Somebody&quot; and &quot;One Way Street&quot;?  Oh my Lord!  That is just incredible!  The solo's the two are incredible, who woulda thunk right?  Hah, no.  Joe Perry, Steven Tyler, Joey Kramer, Tom Hamilton, and Brad Whitford are definetly starting off great!  If you don't buy this, buy Toy's in the Attic, if you liked that, you'll love this!  Buy this album if you like Aerosmith!  Buy this album if you like music!
0446310786|5.0|This is the book that got me started reading novels. It is a great story of truth as told through a childs view of events happening in a small southern town during The Great Depression.  In dealing with adult subject matter this is not a childrens book  Right and wrong, good and evil are dealt with here better then any book I have read since. The movie is equally as good as the book. So if you don't have the time to read the novel,then see the movie, you won't be disappointed.
B00005TT77|4.0|It would have been 5 starts, but there were just a few songs that I didn't really care for.  But the rest of them  &quot;WOW&quot;!  What a great job all the artist did.  I especially loved Stereophonics version of &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; and Rufus Wainwright's &quot;Across the Universe&quot;.  I really enjoyed the fact that they used songs that didn't get enough attention when the Beatles did them.  Maybe now they can get the attention that they originally deserved!    <BR>A definate &quot;MUST GET CD&quot; if you like rare Beatle tunes.
B00004Z459|5.0|For starters, I'm an old guy.  I've never heard of Linkin Park prior to a few weeks ago, I don't watch MTV or listen to much new music.  For reference, my favorite band is X, favorite single performer is Jimi Hendrix.<br />A coworker of mine was playing 'Hybrid Theory', I heard it, liked it, bought it, and now I believe it's the best album I've heard since The Offspring's 'Smash'.  VERY impressed with the intelligence of the lyrics and diversity of musical styles.
B00003CXP1|2.0|I can see how some people can praise this as highly as they do.  I just can't do it myself...For those who honestly loved the movie, I can understand.  I just can't see so many people honestly enjoying something so disturbing.  <BR>I usually love movies where you are left feeling uneasy, left almost feeling afraid of the world.  That uncomforable feeling at the end of a movie is what, in my opinion, makes some films so great.  See Happiness.  See In The Company of Men.  See a lot of other films.  Just don't see this one.  <BR>The problem with this movie wasn't the actors.  The performances that were given were truely special.  On that level, I did like the movie.  I most especially enjoyed Ellen Burstyn, who does an amazing job with her character.  She gives a character without much to say some incredible depth, and you are left feeling her pain.  The direction of the film was very slick.  The drug scenes were at the very least interesting.  I've never shot up, and after watching this film, I can promise you I never will.  <BR>My problem with the film is that you aren't just left feeling uncomfortable at the end of the film.  You are dragged through it by your hair - over hot coals, and shards of glass.  It gives you that truely uncomfortable feeling throughout, and by the end you are truely happy that it is over, and left wondering why you didn't turn it off earlier.  You feel, throughout the movie, as if you were doing the drugs with the characters.  The story doesn't make all that much sense after a while, and the film tends to just drag on, so as to make you suffer with them.  <BR>A truely painful experience.
B00003CXHJ|3.0|U-571 is a throwback to the good old fashioned days of the Hollywood W.W.II submarine genre. U-571 has a very implausible plot but it still remains to be extremely entertaining through its execution of action and suspense. My only real complaint is that the film gives credit to the theatrically heroic Americans for recovering a German Enigma machine for decoding orders sent to their submarines. This was something that the British had actually accomplished and should be given credit for. The United States did not recover an Enigma machine till near the end of the war. That being said, a real highlight of this DVD is the incredible surround sound. Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton, Harvey Keitel and David Keith all give credible performances.
B0000024W3|1.0|There are as many reasons to speculate as to why this album is so bad as there are people speculating. One thing is certain though... They are right. Dylan is a genius. One of the top 10 most influential musicians to be produced by America in the 20th Century. But, in this case, the emperor is naked. And there is no excuse. Save your money. Or burn it. At least the pain will be over sooner.
B00005NWM3|5.0|What can I say....This CD rocks! Great CD to wake up with on the commute to work. A large coffee and &quot;Silver Side Up&quot; and I'm ready to go!! From beginning to end this CD seems to flow so well and not all the songs sound the same as some albums in this genre do. Nickelback's songs are well written--no cliche' wimpy ballads with some cheesy chorus on this one. Virtually every song has a great guitar hook that grows on you after several plays. You just have to crank up the volume for tracks like &quot;Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Where Do I Hide&quot; and &quot;Too Bad&quot;.  It goes way beyond the 1st two releases--This is NOT one of those albums where you find yourself only enjoying the song you heard on the radio which lured you into buying it in the first place. I only wish it were a bit longer--but hey, I'll take quality over quantity any day. Congratulations Vancouver on having these guys home to party with on New Years Eve!
B00005QY5Y|4.0|I've only known about Ryan Adams and Whiskeytown for about a year (my sister gave me Heartbreaker last Christmas), but I've spent that year getting my hands on everything related to him that I could.  This album was everything that I could have hoped for and I can't wait until his next release--they just don't come out fast enough for me!  The songs slowly work their way into your head and stick there.  Adams is a master of the deceptively simple turn of phrase.  Maybe you've heard &quot;New York, New York&quot; on the radio and you are wondering if you would like this cd or not.  I really can't say.  If you are just following the radio chum stream that this song got strangely mixed up in, I probably wouldn't know what you'd like.  But if you get a sense that this cd may appeal to you, you should give it a try because it is super.
1878424319|5.0|This book is absolutely the best I've heard.  (I have the audio tape).  I was told about this book by a friend and I listen to it in my car every day over and over.  The first time I heard it, I have to admit, I thought it was quite strange. But, I stuck in there because I trusted the opinion I had received about this book.  I am so glad I listened to the whole tape.  My life has changed because of my new way of thinking.  If you're looking for self-esteem enhancement, a motivational book or a new way of looking at life, this is the book to get.
B00005MP58|5.0|You don't have to be an adult to appreciate this wonderful story of Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy. I am only fourteen, but I absolutely love this movie. The acting is so good. Each and every actor/actress does a perfect job of being the sort of people you imagine them to be in the book. Jennifer Ehle does a wonderful job of playing Elizabeth Bennett, especially when Lady Cathrine de Burgh pays her a visit toward the end. Colin Firth does an excellent job of being the very misunderstood Mr. Darcy. However, the best acting comes from Mrs. Bennett. She is so hilarious!! This adaption of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is definitely worth buying and no DVD collection is complete without it.
B00005K3NY|3.0|As near as I can determine, we in the US have yet to GET &quot;Scanners&quot; as David Cronenberg imagined it.  The version I've seen is obvious hacked half to death, a few actors have OBVIOUSLY been dubbed or badly looped, and there's just enough missing that I can't buy this is what Cronenberg wanted.  <br />Certainly his taste and developing skill are on display here.  There are some very well-selected shots and clever imagery, as well as a focus on what makes the mind &quot;The Mind.&quot;  Of course, there's also the infamous gore; blood hounds will get their fill here, that's for sure.  I don't mean to make this sound like a bad movie.  It's not.<br />I just don't think it's what Cronenberg put together.  I think it's what the American distributors decided to turn it into.  This is fine as it stands, but when will we get the real &quot;Scanners?&quot;
B000002UAX|5.0|This is THE album. From the first second to the very last one, it's a rock and roll accomplishment as I've never seen before - and probably won't see in much time.<br />\\"Helter Skelter\\" is a favourite. Hard rock Beatles played so loudly and so intense, hence Ringo's famous quote at the end. \\"Dear Prudence\\" and \\"Cry Baby Cry\\" are two of the most beautiful songs this fellas ever made, as well as \\"Happiness Is A Warm Gun\\" is the trippy one.<BR> <BR>\\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" is Harrison's contribution, and one of the best songs the Beatles ever recorded. \\"Rocky Racoon\\", beautifully written and \\"Revolution #1\\" a classic.<br />Despite individual tracks, the whole thing is a masterpiece. You can't live without listening to this, 'cause in my opinion, this is the most influential album ever. \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" is a good one, but this, this is the whole shebang.<br />No doubt, my #1. As \\"Good Night\\" ends, sweetly sung by Ringo, the audience know it's over. Time to rewind and play it again :)
B00003CXA2|5.0|This movie is the ultimate feel-good movie you can ever watch. It describes how a person with a below average brain who's little dumb does so many wonders and goes through so many phases in life doing a great number of things unintentionally.<br />Tom Hanks has played the character exceptionally well and I bet there was no other actor who could've played his part. He was the best guy they could choose for the role. The special effects in the movie are just breathtaking, beautifully executed!<br />The DVD is nicely produced and one of the vital points of the DVD set is the additonal features DVD. The behind-the-scenes documentaries, special effects documentary and other personal interviews make this whole DVD set an asset to your collection.
B00005OWIU|2.0|For a composer of the calibre of Williams, I expected more than a bland rehashing of Harry's theme every two minutes in the soundtrack.  In other compositions, Williams executes variations that thrill the ears and engage your imagination.  Not so in this soundtrack.  Repetitive, overblown, and not what I expected from such a promising project as the Harry Potter movie.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Despite other reviews you may have read, I'm here to tell you that &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is NOT one of the worst movies of the year. It's unfathomable to even say it! Yes the movie's long, but does that make it bad? No way. Ben Affleck is in it...does that make it bad? No way. Unfortunantely those two reasons seem to be the ONLY reasons it's getting worst pic reviews. People keep compairing it to &quot;Titanic&quot; and I think that has a lot to do with it's bad reviews. Well, I'm going to tell you why I think it's one of the best and not the bomb most people are perceiving it to be.<br />After reading and hearing countless bad reviews of the movie, I decided to go and rent the movie and see for myself if it was really as bad as everyone was saying. I found the acting superb and the visual effects stunning. The bombing was so vivid that I thought I was right there in the middle of it. It doesn't look at all fake and it's hard to tell whether the scenes were shot on a lot or in the actual Pearl Harbor itself. And the casting was right on the money. Aside from the lead actors, you've got a supporting cast that consists of Jon Voight (in a dead-on FDR impression), Cuba Gooding Jr., Jennifer Garner and Alec Baldwin, amoung others.<br />I also enjoyed the love story between the characters portrayed by Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, and Josh Hartnett. It's so sad to see the emotions Kate's character, Lt. Evelyn Johnson, runs through when she thinks boyfriend, Captain Rafe McCawley (Affleck), has died. It's also very interesting to see the effects his return has on her budding relationship with best friend, Captain Danny Walker (Hartnett). The ending will surprise you, I promise. It's very touching and had me crying for about 10 minutes after the movie ended. The lifelong friendship between Rafe and Danny is so special and only adds to the movie's appeal. <br />Aside from the movie, the special features the 2-set DVD offers is amazing. You get the following: &quot;Journey ToThe Screen: The Making of Pearl Harbor&quot;, The History Channel's Documentary &quot;Unsung Heros&quot; (which in itself is worth the price of the DVD), and Faith Hill's soaring theme song/video &quot;There You'll Be&quot;. After watching the documentary and the &quot;Making Of..&quot;, I promise that you'll have a greater respect for the movie and more importantly the people who actually lived through the Pearl Harbor events. It's very moving to relive that day with survivors and to hear the stories of those who died. <br />In short, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is a great movie. So before you dismiss this movie, go rent it and decide for yourself like I did. I think you'll find that it's not one of the worst movies of the year, but one of the best. <br />God Bless America! Remember December 07, 1941!<br />Gennie Bailey-Rogers
B00000JGHM|5.0|Near-perfect, some reviewers have claimed that &quot;Heat&quot; is overlong, and over-violent. Actually, most of the problems with this film, if any, derive from the fact that the film is not long enough. Of course, you can't have a 5-hour film these days, but if there were to be one, &quot;Heat&quot; would be it. This film's only disappointment is Michael Mann's unfortunate inability to more fully develop the multitude of intriguing characters created in this crime-drama masterstroke.<br />The story is old, but boldly new at the same time. Crooks stealing things, and things going wrong in the process. And the &quot;Heat&quot; which ensues. Mann's story here is really cool, and original in its adaptation from a previous effort. Practice apparently makes perfect.<br />What truly makes this film are the characters which Mann has created. Both realistic, and necessarily stereotypical for a Hollywood film, Mann finds an excellent balance between the needs of the screenwriter, and the needs of the audience. Because of the large panoply of characters, all of which are essential to the picture, this film retains immense depth even after multiple viewings. As a production side-note, &quot;Heat&quot; is the stylistic mass-market high watermark of the 90's, but the effort does not rest on those laurels alone.<br />DeNiro, as usual, is both perfectly cast and fully engaging, and his performance as a professional criminal, while standing on its own, mainly lends credibility to the other performances: as such, DeNiro supports as much as he leads, which is no small feat. The neat thing here is that, because of the film's length, the audience actually gets some breathing room and quality time with the Master, in a spectrum of encounters with the various characters throughout the story. In &quot;Heat&quot;, DeNiro is a man with a mission, and it's truly gripping to watch the picture progress as DeNiro's character tries to hold everything together within a vortex which spins just atthe fringe of his control<br />An awesome, all-star supporting cast, including a somewhat-bizarre, but excellent Val Kilmer as DeNiro's prot&eacute;g&eacute;, and the gorgeous (and totally believable) Ashley Judd as Kilmer's wife, make massive contributions. Hank Azaria, as Judd's side-interest, is well-cast and loathsome. Tom Sizemore as the tough, but intelligent ex-con Cheritto lends bulk and backbone to DeNiro's heist crew.  Danny Trejo as the loyal, ultimately-star-crossed Trejo, meets the mark in a heart-wrenching exit.<br />Jon Voight, brilliantly made-up as Nate, DeNiro's go-man, also stands out in an understated portrayal. The multi-talented Tom Noonan as the handicapped hacker Kelso, fills out the outstanding cast of arch criminals on the crime end of this story.<br />But there are two sides to this 3+ hour coin. The crooks are met by the heat, namely Al Pacino as a disaffected, but dedicated, detective, on the 'downside of his third marriage' to the compelling and hot Diane Venora as Justine, who asks for nothing but connection with Pacino's character Vincent. Pacino, the hopeless cop, is unable to give, yet redeems himself later in an unique vignette of realistically-depicted teen trauma. With the Pacino character, Mann creates a sort of benevolent reflection of DeNiro's villainous image, and, therein, the basis for the powerful dramatic tension that makes this film a true classic.<br />Needless to say, Pacino utterly nails it. No surprise.<br />The scenes with Pacino and Tone Loc and Ricky Harris have been called over-the-top. Wrong! This is Pacino at his best.<br />But Pacino and DeNiro, while co-stars, co-leads, and synergistic prime-movers within the larger story, are again in many ways secondary to an even deeper supporting cast that also includes William Fichtner in a pivotal role as Van Zant, as well as the well-directed Henry Rollins as Van Zants' henchman.<br />As the story develops the audience is brought to the depths of even deeper hatred, in the form of Kevin Gage's fine performance as the scum-bag stand-in Waingro. Amy Brenneman, as DeNiro's new gal, adds an important twist in a great outing.<br />The only negatives are a patch containing very sour guitar notes in an otherwise-serviceable soundtrack, and a slightly over-made-up Pacino in what is to this date an unique scene featuring Pacino and DeNiro squaring off.  Minor drawbacks in a major-league success.<br />Own this movie! It's as good as it gets within the genre, and it will be until Mann remakes it, yet again, for the new century.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Best Movie of 2001, this outstanding and stunning piece of computer animation has been the most compelling one since<br />&quot; Toy Story&quot; and &quot; Toy Story 2&quot;. Mike Myers is at his funny best<br />as a Grumpy Green Orge who goes on a quest to find a princess<br />so he can get his Swamp back but the real quest that he hasn't realised is to find what trying to be kind is all about.<br />Must see movie and must own DVD cause it's got cool extras.<br />This movie also stars Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy, John Lithgouth as well.
B0000048V8|5.0|My son loved The Snowman when he was only a year old.  And two.  And three.  And now four, and he still loves to watch.  Some of my fondest memories will forever be snuggling up with him back when he was so tiny and watching The Snowman.  And his little voice saying, &quot;Owl&quot;, at the beginning, and being amazed that he knew that.<br />I am still enchanted with the wonderful animation and beautiful music.  I've probably watched it 100 times, and will probably watch it 100 more.<br />We have given away several copies as gifts.  It's a sure winner.
0783225849|5.0|It is my opinion that all modern horror films are, in some way, children of Psycho, particularly the slasher subgenre that dominated the late 1970s and 1980s. What makes Psycho work so well is that, like many of Hitchcock's best, it works on so many levels. When I first saw the film I was about 9 or 10 years old and I liked it because it had a very creepy atmosphere to it as well as a good number of scares. Now that I'm much older, though, I could appreciate the quality of the acting, how much Anthony Perkin's twitchy performance gave the film the qualities I liked about it as a boy. Also, Psycho is very funny in parts! Watching Norman bite his nails as he waits for the car to sink into the swamp always gets a chuckle out of me and the rich tycoon is gloriously over-the-top. (&quot;I declare!&quot; &quot;I don't that's how I get to keep it.&quot;)<br />It's a real shame somebody wasted their time and money remaking this film. What that attempt showed is that when it comes to combining suspense, fear, and humor, you just can't top the original.
B00005N9CV|5.0|so, i heard about diana krall - i even heard a song or two on the local jazz station. then i bought this cd - MY GOD !!!!<BR>the disc should be rated &quot;R&quot; just because she sounds that good. try it, you'll love it !
B00005O3VC|5.0|not only do you get everything mentioned above, but there are 3 unlist surprizes that await you on this DVD.<br />1. On the majority of DVD players, you can't stop the subtitles from popping up at timecodes that related to the Follow The Killer Rabit feature. It's kinda a fun game, keep the dvd remote close by becuase this disc will test your reflexs.<br />2. If you've seen the movie before, remember those silly captions during the opening credits? well Sony/Columbia has added another awesome feature. They removed the first one so that we can imagine our very own caption being there! My friends and I sit there competing to see who can come up with the funniest caption to replace the one that they removed, so far none has been able to beat, \\"Return this DVD immediately.\\" lol we are so silly!<br />3. If you don't like the 1. hidden extra, well Sony/Columbia will help you out there, simply mail them the entire DVD package. Don't worry though shipping at your cost added to the retail price is more then worth it. they refuse to think that anyone could dislike the 2. hidden extra (so that will still be there) and who could disagree!?<br />for the sarcasticly impaired, there are major defects with this disc. It is a great movie and the dvd transfer is excellent as wel as the Listed extras. However the defects really ruin it all. ... please remember, ALL the discs shipped with the errors, but the dialog subtitles poping up every so often ( 1. hiden extra ) doesn't effect every player. which is goods news if you are never going to buy another dvd player in your lifetime.<br />i don't know the rules on links in reviews and i won't risk posting one not knowing, but there is a online petition out there, please sign it so we can get all the glitches removed and own a truely fabulous DVD of this great comedic classic.
B00003CX5P|2.0|Doesn't anybody remember the Ewoks? Remeber when Lucas made Greedo shoot before Han? As good as Empire was, I still feel like I'm watching the muppets. Star Wars movies are basically for children. But even for a children's movie, this is a pretty bad one, and I'm not just saying that because of the hype. I really did try to like it. Any of those actors (minus the kid of course) are exceptional actors in their own right, especially when they are working with good directors and writers. They might have well been puppets, plus its hard to work in the shadow of Jar Jar, right. <br />Technically,the DVD looks great and has tons of extras. But, if you're like me, you don't care how it was made or even why. The 2 stars I gave are for Natalie Portman for being so beautiful.<br />I remember sitting in the movie theatre before it started thinking  how I wish my dad (who told me sometime in the future there will be 6 more Star Wars movies) was alive to see this. When the movie was done, I thought he was better off.
0553801481|5.0|When I finished Assassin's Quest, I was saddened and resigned to hearing the last of FitzChivalry Farseer.  While I was browsing in a bookshop late November, however, I discovered Fool's Errand and imediately grabbed myself a copy.  <br />It was the cover that first grabbed my attention.  John Howe's cover (not shown above) is spectacular.  Compared to his work on the Farseer Trilogy, Foll's Errand is 100% better.  It was one of the major factors of why I bought large paperback - I couldn't bear to have the ilustrations downsized.   <br />My other reason for buying it was the story itself.<br />Set about fifteen years after Assassin's Quest, Robin Hobb brings us back to Fitz, former assassin..., still living a simple life in self-imposed exile.  When Chade, his mentor, returns to Fitz's life, shortly followed by The Fool (one of my favourite characters), Fitz is drawn back to Buckkeep Castle.  Once again the the Royal family has need of his services and Fitz finds himself searching for Prince Dutiful, the son of his body and missing heir to Farseer throne.  The search soon leads him into the very circumstances he had fled and Fitz must confront both his past and the lure his magic heritage, the Skill.<br />In Fool's Errand, Robin Hobb provides a book that can be read by itself or as a sequel to the Farseer Trilogy.  Her writing is as good, perhaps better, than her fans have come to expect.  The running action present in the former series gradually builds up in Fool's Errand, leaving one pulling their hair out while waiting for the next book. Hobb manages to bring back the same characters yet presents them as more mature, a task in which many other authors have failed, their characters changing in personality from book to book.  Her take on the fantasy field is different, as well, looking at the downside of loyal service royalty when too often the benefits are the focus of authors.<br />Best of all, perhaps, is the length of Fool's Errand.  You won't simply be reading until late at night - its more likely you'll still be reading when the sun comes up.

0743216458|1.0|I was disappointed.  This book is just nothing like Ambrose.
0060930187|5.0|THE BELL JAR is often compaired to Salinger's CATCHER IN THE RYE. There is actually a certain basis for this: both novels deal with youthful characters who are completely disenchanted by the world. But beyond this the comparison breaks down, for where CATCHER is essentially a character study, Plath's BELL JAR presents us with a tightly plotted story concerning a young woman's descent into insanity, and is in my opinion considerably more successful in an overall sense than virtually anything Salinger ever wrote.<br />The novel is largely autobiographical, recounting one of Plath's most notorious mental collapses that led to a very famous sucide attempt. In dealing with this personally volatile material, Plath shows remarkable control, and gracefully walks the fine line between carefully crafted fiction and self-indulgence, creating in the process a modern classic indicative of America at mid-century.<br />Plath herself considered the book simply a commercial &quot;pot boiler,&quot; a project undertaken in the hope of generating some cash. It is quite true that book is clearly written as a popular novel rather than serious fiction; it is also quite true that the book generates enough heat to boil water. But Plath was a uniquely gifted artist, and her talent simply bursts the seams of the genre: the book is possessed of a stunning passion and numerous powerful images delivered in a singularly uncompromising tone. Highly recommended.

1577311523|4.0|I bought Tolle's book THE POWER OF NOW yesterday.  Once I started reading, I couldn't put the book down.  His message resonates with what little I know about Being, and with much of what I understand about Buddhism.<br />I fervently agree that the human race must awaken to a higher level of consciousness in order to survive.  The evidence is of impending calamity is flooding us -- violence, superficial commercialism, imbalance of opportunities and power, hunger, disease, and materiality as the measure of the person.<br />Social action only goes so far.  The real answer is that each one of must take responsibility for our own spiritual awakening, for when we have experienced awakening, we will emanate compassion and healing just by Being.<br />What I missed in Tolle's book was a deeper teaching on the myriad ways the egoic mind latches onto false identity.  He mentions some of the classic ways we create identity through racism, nationalism, and so on.<br />In particular, I was disappointed in the way that Tolle dealt with gender.  In truth, gender is but one more way in which the egoic mind latches onto identification.  But rather than encourage readers to explore the falseness of gender as identity, Tolle seems to bless the male/female dichotomy as one aspect of the physical world that has substance.  He does this by writing in depth about the problems and pitfalls of the romantic heterosexual relationship.<br />But if we are going to be true to the path, we must also view gender as an identity grasped at by the egoic mind.<br />If you want to understand more about gender, I highly recommend Martine Rothblatt's book THE APARTHEID OF SEX.<br />Criticisms aside, I think Tolle offers us a remarkable guide to finding joy through experiencing the NOW.
6305603847|5.0|I rented this DVD recently, and I must say I'm quite impressed.  I'd seen The Wall before but for some reason it never hit me like this time.  Most of the story is based on Waters' own life, and you can really feel some of his very personal fears and excitement coming through in the storyline.  The movie is incredible, and it'll take you at least days to get through all the extras on the disc.  One DVD well worth the money!<br />PS:  if anyone out there is a Tool fan, but hasn't gotten into Floyd...YOU NEED TO CHECK THEM OUT!!
B00005B4GU|5.0|Radiohead are underrated. Because they're such a reliable part of the musical landscape, consistently brilliant for years now, this album has been taken for granted a bit - decent reviews, and sitting in the bottom half of most critics' top ten lists.<br />This is the best CD of 2001 by a wide margin. There's a relentless musical imagination and a surety of touch throughout. Part of their power is not just musical - I think they're tapping into the spirit of the age, a portrait of the years when the structures of community crumble, while machines insert prefabricated distractions into atomised lives. It's scary stuff, but it makes for rivetting art.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|There are better versions of every song available, but put these performances together and what have you got?  Bippity, Boppity, Boo.  If you liked the movie, you'll like this soundtrack which moves in plotline order and whirls past faster than the dancing at Moulin Rouge.  As musicals go, this cast can actually sing a little, not just 'sell' the song on screen.  Hated the movie?  Try the 1952 version.  That soundtrack contains excerpts from some nice classical and easy listening pieces.
B00005NWRS|4.0|Okay, so his borrowings are obvious to the point of parody... In fact his morphing vocals are pretty comical: suddenly developing a quavering upper register for his Neil Young-ish \\"Wildflowers\\", over-enunciating his way through the Stones knock-off \\"Tina Toledo\\", then skipping across the words of the Van-esque \\"Answering Bell\\". Count our blessings that there's no Ryan-does-Tom-Waits-does-Louis-Armstrong on \\"Goodnight Hollywood Blvd\\".<br />And I also admit that this stuff is shallow as a petri dish, and it's just about passed its enjoy-by date in my household. But I can promise this disc will give you a hot 3 or 4 weeks, with no nasty side effects. Worth every penny.
B00005MP58|5.0|I first saw the mini-series on A&amp;E.  The moment I saw it available on VHS I had to have it.  I have since put quite a few miles on the six tape set and it is a bit worn out now.  I'm very pleased to find it on DVD.  The characters and performances are wonderful.

But with modern technology, well, Dre makes the greatest electronic beats in the history of the world. I'm not egsagerating when i say, in a few hundred years, Dr. Dre will be recognised in the same way that Beethoven and Mozart are now. No point going on about the content, listen to the clips. Then buy it. Not for Dre's under-par rapping skills, hes got the whole of aftermath rapping with him, but for the truly astounding beats.<BR>Incredible.
B00005RZTI|5.0|well, kylie's new album, fever, is already everything we fans could want and more...it successfully reflects kylie's increasing maturity as a talented artist while still giving us every reason to want to shake it like nobody's business.  but the australian release of the album dominates in doing it one better.  how's that?  this version contains the special track &quot;tightrope&quot; that is not available outside australia.  too bad for the rest of us 'cause &quot;tightrope&quot; is easily one of the best songs on the album.  it has the kylie pop that we all know and love and an exemplary expression of something deeper behind it as well.  good beats as always, and it's also evident that kylie puts every bit of effort into it.  the lyrics are clever and catchy without forgetting to be satisfyingly substantial.  kylie's the bomb...undisputed!  :)
0553801481|5.0|If you haven't read the Farseer trilogy my recommendation is that you read it first.  Not because you have to for this book but because you'll want to.  The incredible character and story development on which this book is built is simply too rich to step past.  Having said that, this book is sufficiently apart from the Farseer trilogy that new readers can step in here.  They will find a great book and one with less pain and desperation than the Farseer trilogy which is so much a part of the main character Fitz.<br />As Fitz and company seemed to be closing in on Price Dutiful it dawned on me that the predictable ending I was looking for was actually not in keeping with the Farseer trilogy and I felt compelled to finish the book in one sitting.<br />The Liveship Traders series only lightly touches this book and I found just three points that I wanted to look for when I reread the Liveship Traders series.<br />Fool's Errand seemed to be setting the stage for a sweeping tale in future books as characters and sub-plots come and go but unlike some trilogy books the story is whole and feels complete in this single book.
B00005RHGK|5.0|this movie goes back to the basics of fright.  setting the tone of the scary things to come.  trish and derry will get more than they bargainded for. ithe ending of this movie will get to you.  i know it did to me.  especially when the phsycic said, &quot;i hear that song and one of you is screamin the last screams youll ever scream.&quot;  doesnt that sound creepy, but you know what it was true.
0553801481|5.0|I read the description for this book before it came out, and I couldn't think of any other story involving fitz or nighteyes that could eclipse their last adventures in the Farseer trilogy.<br />I was wrong.<br />This book picks up 15 years in the future when Fitz (or Tom Badgerlock as he is called in this story) is 35 years old and feeling every year of it.  The book starts with Tom complacently tending his farm/cottage in the woods far apart from human civilization and still recovering from the  hardships the farseer line (chade specifically) had placed on him in the last series.<br />A series of visits alters Tom's simple life and he is flung back into the thick of things in a very different buckeep where he is charged in finding the missing Price Dutiful and (again) saving the world from disaster.<br />Sounds pretty commmon from that explanation, but this book is anything but.  Even though this land was thoroughly explored in the previous two trilogies Robin Hobb has managed to add yet more depth and breadth to her land while somewhat bridging the gap between the Farseer and the Liveship traders trilogies.  The fool reappears and again plays a central role, but the most amazing character aspect of this novel is fitz himself.<br />One of the reasons I praised Robin for her last series was the believability and real world harsh situations her characters were forced into, as well as their subsequent growth and maturing throughout the series.  I was very surprised with how well Hobb managed the aging of fitz, although in my mind I will probably always think of him as the brash and unrestrained 20 year old I first came to know, Hobb has handled his transition into the middle years in incredible style.  You can almost see the age in Fitz's character, and while his old heart and stamina sometimes shine through, at no point through the story did I mistake this fitz for the old one.<br />The characters have assumed a more mature stance, and I think that this is probably Hobb's strongest writing ability: the skill to create believable and loveable characters, and have them grow and still have them be great characters in their maturity.<br />This book deserves 5 stars certainly, and I await any more books that Ms. Hobb will write far more than many other authors in the fantasy world.ly Hobb's strongest writing ability: the skill to create believable and loveable characters, and have them grow and still have them be great characters in their maturity. <br />This book deserves 5 stars certainly, and I await any more books that Ms. Hobb will write far more than many other authors in the fantasy world.
B00003CX5P|2.0|Wouldn't it be nice if Lucas had put as much thought into making the actual movie &quot;Phantom Menace&quot; as he did designing a DVD to explain how he made the movie? As a DVD this is a good buy if you are a Star Wars fan -- and who the hell isn't? -- are interested in the filmmaking process' nuts and bolts, or want to see how a movie that is 80% special effects is really shot. The problem is the &quot;extra features&quot; don't hide the fact that &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; is a one-and-a-half star film riding the back of a five-star triology. Badly written, sluggishly paced, filled with one-dimensional characters, and frequent digressions from its own largely incomprehensible plot, this is easily the worst outing of the lot, and the only comfort for fans is that Lucas could scarcely do worse in &quot;Episode II.&quot; Laim Neeson is pretty good as the worlds-weary Jedi master Qui-Gon Jinn, though his character seems to have very little moral sense for a Jedi (&quot;I didn't come here to free slaves,&quot; he explains at one point....well what the hell kind of guardian of peace &amp; justice are you anyway?). The excellent Ewan McGregor is completely wasted as young Obi-Wan, though he does an excellent job of wielding his lightsaber. Natalie Portman (Queen Amidala) is cute as hell but either she can't act, which I doubt, or she can't choke out her dialogue without sounding like she's reading it upside-down in bad light on a moving train (&quot;Now...ambassador...we...will...discuss...a....new...treaty...&quot;)<br />and Jake Lloyd just plain sucks as young Darth Vader, though again it's hard to tell where his bad acting stops and the crappy script begins. Ian McDairmid is enjoyably smarmy as chancellor Palpatine, but since he's holding back his villainy for later episodes, he doesn't exactly steal the scenes he's in. And Samuel L. Jackson is strictly a cameo. The most striking character in the film, ironically enough, is Darth Maul, the super-badass Sith Lord who is Darth's precusor. Maul might as well be the Man With No Name for all the dialogue he gets, and those who thought he was going to give ol' Darth a run for his money as a villain will be disappointed. Maul is strictly a man of action, but what action! Actor Ray Park has some outstanding moves, and the lightsaber duel at the end is ALMOST, but not quite, worth watching the rest of the film. All in all, not worth the 16 year wait. My only suggestion, however, would have been letting Maul chop off Jar Jar Binks' head, preferably about halfway through the film, when it becomes painfully apparent this drivelling idiot is going to do his best to ruin an already flawed film. Hopefully somebody else will be quicker on the trigger in the next outing so we won't have to hear his stupid remarks or atrocious, space-rastafarian grammar.o is Darth's precusor.

B00005QZ7U|4.0|Well, it wasn't the best movie of all time, as has already been pointed out.  For one thing, the use of &quot;modern&quot; songs in Paris in 1890 (?) is a little jarring...  And yet it's pretty funny as well.  I'm a sucker for tragedy, so the ending really appealed to me.  What really surprised me about the movie, though, were the vocal talents of its stars.  I thought that Ewan and Nicole both sang very well for being actors who don't normally sing in movies--especially Ewan.
0446677450|5.0|I loved it.  If you want an accounting or economic text you're buying the wrong book.  If you want investment advice, he has other books.  This book is about redefining how you THINK of money.  If you've already read a get rich quick book, you'll be disappointed because he's not going to give you a roadmap; he defines the barries that will stop you.<br />I am a CPA and I've noticed that most of my clients who are doing well follow the principles in the book.  It's pleasure reading, but it makes money planning digestible.  It's a motivator and provides clarity for what most of us already know.  <br />The book focuses on a change in our definition of sucess and wealth to being financially free not to work if we didn't want to.  <br />It focuses on a change in mentality from an employee who will almost always be capped in their earning abilities.  It's the concepts he presents that are important.  He does reiterate them, but I believe that's part of the motivation.<br />I send the books to lots of my friends.
B00005ASOI|4.0|Called the \\"Italian Hitchcock,\\" Dario Argento has made some of the most memorable films I've ever seen. \\"Suspiria\\" is widely praised as his masterpiece, and it is a masterpiece in certain ways. It is full of all the things a horror film should have: Good shocks, an eerie musical score, exquisite lighting, and effective camera moves. Any director who's ever made a horror film knows that the camera has to become like the third character in a scene where two people are talking, and the music is the fourth. Creepy music and precise visuals make a horror film memorable. \\"Suspiria\\" has both, although the dubbed over dialogue (I still don't get why he does this, even if it is to avoid working with boom mics, having them drop into frame on accident or something) can get your bad attention, and the acting is somewhat subpar for the most part. But as a rule, horror films have never thrived on excellent performances (\\"Carrie\\" is an exception), so it doesn't truly matter. We have our final girl, who we care about, and the school that makes as an excellent backdrop for the film's terror.<br />The film centers around a dancer who has enrolled in a school of dancing somewhere in Italy probably. It is in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by woods for what could be miles or merely a few hundred yards. Jessica Harper is our final girl and she fills the role nicely, using her wide eyes and girl next door looks to capture our sympathy as things happen to her. When she finds out that the school is actually a front for a witch's coven, all hell breaks loose, and she may be the only one with the brains and the information to end it all. That's pretty much it. There are too many surprises to really say much more. The film begins almost immediately, letting characterization come along for the ride instead of wasting a half hour of valuable time on introductions to all the dancers and teachers at the school.<br />The real stars of the film are the music and cinematography, which when combined make a truly atmospheric and freaky experience. Dario Argento's personal Goblin group composed the music for \\"Suspiria\\" and they are in their highest form. Their score is equally compelling and wicked. Argento's camerawork is some of the best he's done, using his lighting to fill in the gaps of what could have been a boring scene. It's a real joy to watch a film like this which takes so much delight in scaring the wits out of you. Argento has real style, and it shows.d make a truly atmospheric and freaky experience.

B00005KFUM|5.0|Here, ye, here ye--please take notice, as the most innovative album of the new milennium has arrived!<br />I first heard Muse on a sampler CD my sister gave me.  Among less-notable tracks was the song  &quot;Feeling Good&quot;  from the album<BR>&quot;Origin of Symmetry.&quot;  It caught my ear immediately.  I knew I HAD to have the album. Even though it costs more than most CDs these days, I am so glad I bought it!<br />If you have never heard of this band, do not let that deter you!  All true rock lovers will appreciate their fusion of old and new to create an exciting, original sound.  Here's my best description of it:  take the vocals, piano expertise, and dramatic flare of Freddie Mercury  (of Queen), add a little Radiohead, throw in some space-rock sounds of Pink Floyd, and top it all off with the loudness and agression of Limp Bizkit, minus the rap.  Hard to imagine?  Maybe so, but believe me, Muse is an up-and-coming force to be reckoned with.  Apparently they already have a growing fan base in England, their native country, and in other parts of Europe as well.  <br />Muse is a band that definately deserves to be heard outside of the U.K.  Unfortunately, with American airwaves dominated by the likes of Britney Spears and other clones, this trio may not get its chance.  If you love good, loud rock music and are longing for a fresh, intelligent change of pace, you will find this album more than satisfies your cravings!
B00003CX9S|5.0|The true history of The Elephant Man, who's real name was actually &quot;Joseph&quot; Merrick, is one of degradation and misery, only momentarily relieved by his association with Dr. Frederick Treeves and his stay at the London Hospital.  His life as a sideshow freak was actually something he entered into voluntarily, as what he considered the only way he could stay out of the Poor House.  He was abandoned in France by the man who acted as his Barker when the show was shut down, and he did make the harrowing journey back to England much as is depicted in the film, but the mistreatment that he suffers in the movie I have to assume is meant as a composite sort of license taking, as he did spend his childhood in a dormitory for homeless boys, where it is assumed he suffered incredibly, as he would never speak of that time to anyone.  All in all, though, the movie gets it right more often than not, especially the circumstances of his death, which was the most poignant moment I can remember seeing in a movie in a long time.  You should read the book, if chance allows, but the movie is a pretty good substitute.
6304806426|5.0|I am always amazed at the dichotomy of opinion about this movie.  Either people love it and think that it is a classic or they hate it.  I have often judged women early on in a relationship by whether or not they liked it.  This movie is not for everybody. It is long and takes some patience. Those who are patient will be richly rewarded.  The love story is adulterous but it is beautifully portrayed.  The music is wonderful.  After reading the novel I wished that the love story between Hanna and Kip was better delineated but you can't have everything and I think that you do get almost everything here.
6300216268|5.0|Everything about this film is picture, absolutely, Perfect.  The character Harold is beautifully, yet realistically, acted by the talented Bud Cort, and Ruth Gordon makes the movie a classic with her portrayal of the life-loving Maude.  There are many things I adore and &quot;Harold and Maude&quot;, from the costumes to the hilarious lines to the ageless (literally) love story, but I think that it's ability to make an impression on people of any age, my parents love it and I absolutely adore it, is a rare quality in a film.  To the people who say that Harold and Maude's relationship is &quot;creepy&quot;, they obviously do not understand the point, or much else about life, I'm afraid.  I would say that this movie would be entertaining, and maybe even life changing, to anyone who contemplates death a la Harry Burns in &quot;When Harry Met Sally&quot;, likes the satiric and alternative look at the world as in &quot;Fight Club&quot; (without the violence), is un peu depressed, or just wants to see something really fabulous, uplifting, and incredibly delightful!
B0000021S9|5.0|For a group that's been around as long as Chicago (35 years and counting), there are not too many authorized live CDs available. There is, of course, the Carnegie Hall album, which I happen to like (despite the fact that many have panned it), and the numerous bootleg albums, which is taken from Chicago's performance at the Toronto Rock Festival. Then there's Chicago 26, which features their latest lineup. <BR>Live in Japan, however, featues the original lineup (Kath, Cetera, Seraphine), and they sound great. The sound is much superior to the Carnegie Hall CD, and there is even a Japanese version of Question 67 &amp; 68.  If you like early Chicago, or if you like good rock and roll with great horns, then you'll love this CD. This proves that the original Chicago could rock with the best of them.
6304259093|5.0|I think that is the main reason why some people say they didn't like the film. The Crow-City of Angels is not meant to take the place of the first Crow film. It simply carries the idea to another story; a different story. Brandon Lee is not being replaced. Instead, another chapter opens with the character of Ash, played by Vincent Perez. Perez offered a very emotional performance. Unlike the first one, where the character of Eric Draven is mainly angry, the character of Ash is mainly sad. He has a vulnerability that the audience can really feel. When he and his son are murdered, Ash comes back to &quot;make the wrong things right while the crow shows him the way.&quot; Instead of hunting down and immediately killing his murderers, he haunts them, offering a bittersweet revenge. The first Crow is great, however, the second offers more emotion and more complex acting. If you are a true fan of the Crow legacy, I don't see any reason why you wouldn't like this film. I highly recommend it:)
0064471837|5.0|The book was a delightful mix of fantasy dancing along the edge of realism.I'm am eager to read Garth Nix's sequel Lyrail.
0553712837|5.0|It is not John Grisham like everyone wants with the high powered lawyers and the one poor lawyer with a conscience who makes it all right.  This is a short story about how one poor man tries to go against the thinking of everyone of what his Christmas should be only to find in the end that it is not about money, lights or decorations but rather it is family and how when you least expect it, people that you may partially despise can show you what the spirit of Christmas is all about.  It is a light hearted and comical story that had me crying from laughing but at the end for another reason.  I bought several for stocking stuffers and at last account they had been read and passed along.  My entire family has read it and loved it.  Thanks John for once again showing us another side of your character.
6304936303|5.0|But it's supposed to be! Not a spoof of buddy-buddy action movies but certainly a bitter mimic. The humor does seem to hit a bit off base with the darker scenes about the football player's cocaine use and his wife and child's death. The bad guys are typical, but so are the heroes. The one-liners come so often that you get the idea that the script is not bad but simply teasing other buddy flicks. The over-anxious newcomer to crimefighting out for revenge, the hard-headed cop reluctant to help, the sleazy bad guys who are at once slick and disorganized. The important thing to remember is that this movie knows what it is.
0060392886|5.0|I read this book in one day! I could not put it down. These four guys prove that deep down inside, no matter how much money or fame, we are all simple human beings looking for the same things in life. They have all come full circle. This book will make you cringe, make you cry and make you realize that all the stuff you heard about this band is TRUE! The section where Vince talks about Skylar is a tear jerker. Nikki's childhood explains alot about why he was the way he was. Mick finally makes some sense and Tommy, well, he's self-explanatory. This was a really great book and I would recommend it for everyone who remembers what it was like to be a Crue fan in the early 80s.
B000002KBU|5.0|I always thought of Joni Mitchell as a bubblegum-pop/naive hippe type artist but last week I heard a clip off &quot;Blue&quot; on VH1 and I loved the line &quot;My old man/He's a singer in the park&quot;. I bought it and it blew me away. What an excellent album. Great lyrics. Great happily melancholy tone. An all around masterpiece. A great album parallelling the end of a relationship with the end of the Sixties. &quot;California&quot; is a great song about how the death of that Flower Power mentality does not nessacarily mean the end of all great change. In the song, she seems to be saying that she still has faith in California and all that. Altogether, an excellent album that makes me wonder whatever happened to the art of the album.
B000000WJZ|5.0|I will admit this now: I am more of a pop person. But this album just blew me away and I cannot stop listening to it or anything by the Smashing Pumpkins after hearing Siamese Dream for the first time. A long time ago I was a Smashing Pumpkins fan (after listening to Adore... no wonder I dropped the obsession soon enough), but I have rediscovered the passion for their (or rather... Billy's...) music and lyrical sense. The only songs I didn't like on this CD was Sweet Sweet and sometimes Luna. Those two songs got a 3.5/5 from me, but the rest of the CD is perfect. I am in heaven when I listen to this CD. Get this even if you're not yet an SP fan. You will become one.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I think the word missing from many of these reviews is &quot;FANTASY.&quot;  The film is a musical, yes, but above and beyone that it's a fanciful vision dedicated to the human ideals of beauty, freedom, truth and (most importantly) love.  There are plenty of fanciful images:  the moon sings opera, green fairies appear, pixie dust swirls around Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman as they sing on a floating cloud....  Come on, how can you take this movie seriously enough to hate it so much!  And how can you then be so upset when they start singing Madonna...  like the film was super-serious until Elton John entered the picture?  <br />My advice to anyone who likes theatre or Broadway shows:  relax, sit back, and enjoy.  The story and music may not be original, but the VISION is certainly worth attention!
B00005KARK|5.0|I got this for Christmas and watched it with my 6 year old neice that same week.  I had forgotten what a wonderful movie Dumbo is.  The DVD has excellent images and brings back that feeling of being in the movie theatre to see Dumbo.  Dumbo is the ultimate kids movie to teach them why you shouldn't make fun of someone just because they are different.  And it is funny to remember when going to the circus was such a big deal.  This is a must for Disney collector's and even if you aren't, this movie is excellent for children.  My 6 year old neice loved it.  And if you remember it from when you were little, you might just get a little nostalgic yourself.
B000021YQV|5.0|This CD is absolutely a great buy. From &quot;Prison Song&quot; to &quot;Aerials,&quot; it's one of those CDs that only show up once in a great while. This CD is a great pick for any heavy metal fan. Though the sound may be a bit different from their first CD, Toxicity is still great. I can't say that I dislike any of the songs on this CD, but in my opinion the songs that really stand out are &quot;Prison Song,&quot; &quot;Chop Suey!,&quot; &quot;Forest,&quot; &quot;Toxicity,&quot; and &quot;Aerials.&quot; (My favorite being &quot;Forest.&quot;) The unique vocal style of Serj Tankian and the out of this world guitar riffs of Daron Malakian just add to this great CD. You will never get sick of this CD.
B00005JKQX|5.0|&quot;A Beautiful Mind,&quot; A serious, comedic, educational, (and many other adjetives) work of art.  This is a movie that you think about for hours and even days after you saw it.  I recommend it to everyone, although, it is not appropriate for children under the age of 13 (by the way, I am 15).  For children under this age, it would be hard to understand and possibly a bit scary.  A ***** MOVIE!
B00004ZD69|5.0|Canadian nontet (give or take a musician or two) Godspeed You Black Emperor! have created an album filled with what is essentially the most beautiful noise ever recorded by man.<br />Lift Yr. Skinny Fists Like Antennas To Heaven, an album daunting even at pronounciation, is also possibly the most pretentious album ever created, which in part is why it's so impressive. GYBE! will cut no corners in creating what they view to be music taken to perfection, anyone who disagrees can go rot for all they care. This results in an album that is wholly unique in composition and execution. Also, an album that's, sadly, not for everyone.<br />This is music meant to create visions, this is the music of dreams, this is music that seeks to create emotion. Which it usually does, for better or for worse. The pieces are, with few exceptions, built around a slow, meandering crescendo that starts out with a few sparse instruments playing the simplest of melodies and ends in a screaming, cacaphonic landscape of compact noise, a landscape beautiful and disgusting, vast and cramped, harmonious and dissonant all at once. Then all crashes down like a house of cards and a new melody and a new rythm is slowly gathered from the pieces left. Spoken-word samples are sprinkled through the album with what I find to be good effect and the end result is something unlike anything you have ever heard before.<br />Of course, this music is not for everyone. Old men dreaming of better times appear not to interest some, the slow, methodic buildups take their time, the feedback and droning can sometimes grate on the most accustomed ears and the pretention rings true throughout, all of which can make this more than some can stomach. There are also those that find the buildup-crescendo-breakdown-repeat cycle gets boring quickly, a statement I personally think is a bit like saying that talking gets boring quickly because one must repeatedly use vowels, but I digress.<br />My personal opinion, in the odd case you failed to notice, is that GYBE! make the most harrowingly beautiful music today and anyone who can listen to the opening minutes of Storm and only feel boredom must've had their heart surgically removed at a previous date, but I imagine that the persons in question disagree. The end of the matter is that you owe it to yourself to try this album for a few listens. If you dislike it then that is that and I apologize for the time wasted, but if you refuse to even give Lift Yr. Skinny Fists Like Antennas To Heaven a try, you might be missing something truly wonderful.
B000003S09|5.0|This is my first King Crimson Purchase, as I find it oustanding and unique out of the whole progressive rock genre. The album evokes many moods in it's 45 minutes. It starts off with the fiery 21st Century Schizoid Man, which is just as insane as the namesake. It features heavy rock, combined with what I would call manic, in-the-heat-of-the-night jazz with an almost Frank Zappa feel. I Talk To The Wind is an interesting and mellow R&amp;B tune which is very ethereal, melodic and soothing. Love the flute playing on here. Epitath, a very absorbing extended tune with great vocals and mellotron. Once again, this track has an interesting crazed mix of psychadelia/R&amp;B/classical rock. Moonchild starts off like an almost bedtime lullaby, which I find beautiful and imaginative, then it segues into the most challenging part of the disc. The last 9 minutes of this song is nothing but instrumental experimentation. I don't personally find it awful as many others here have stated, in fact I find it enriching and mind-expanding, but still challenging. It especialy works best at nighttime. The Court Of The Crimson King, is probably my favorite, though it's hard to choose. This is the most symphonic on here. The ahhh...melody backed by the D-C-B melody is just phenomenal and too good for words. It's repeated many times throughout the song, and I'm personally pleased with that. The ending tagged on repeats that theme, without the words, and is also taken up two half steps to E-D-C#. I found that magnificent.<br />Please forgive my rambling and my self-proclaimed lack of objectivity. I'm just too pleased with this album, yet I hope this review contained enough information about the content on this disc that is helpful.<br />Thanks
0679457607|4.0|It is one of those books that concentrate on golf as a mind game. It is helpful in explaining why golf shots are difficult to repeat and we should not try to do so. Instead, look at every shot afresh and let the mind (called Self2)takes over. Self 1 is a critic and doubter and should be silenced if you are to improve your score. <br />While my score has not improved yet, I am beginning to enjoy my swings and putts better. Hopefully, I can do what the author did - play only once a week and still break 80.<br />Good read if techniques are getting you nowhere in your game.
B000002UB3|5.0|Although I love classic rock, I'm a Beatles novice.  Well, almost.  I've had R. Soul, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper, White Album &amp; Abbey Road for a few months now, and I've decided at long last that I like Abbey Road best, with Sgt. Pepper &amp; Revolver coming in right behind (I know White Album will grow on me, it's a little more eclectic obviously).  I can't see how anyone could find many holes in this album, it's near perfect.  Nothing need be said about Come Together, Something, and Here Comes the Sun.  There are few who wouldn't be able to sing them verbatim.  Awesome songs.  &quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&quot; got on my nerves at first, but it's catchy and the lyrics are deliciously morbid.  &quot;Oh! Darling&quot; is the kind of song Paul does very well, a nod to 50's rock.  It grew on me, though I still sometimes cringe when Paul starts screaming.  I love &quot;Octopus's Garden&quot;, I just can't help it!  &quot;I Want You&quot; is the key song of the first &quot;side&quot; and is altogether fantastic.  John at his very best.  Not one second too long.  I wish I had known this song when I was 13, it would have gotten my hormones through the day.  <br />After the bluster of &quot;I Want You&quot;, &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; leads off the second &quot;side&quot; brilliantly.  Harrison, as other reviewers have noted, shines on this album.  &quot;Because&quot; is highlighted by breathtaking harmonies.  I dig the primitive synth parts of this song and in &quot;Silver Hammer&quot;.  Tastefully played, like an artist's brush strokes fleshing out each song.  Probably coming from a machine built by Dr. Moog himself.  Some great lead guitar on the latter part of &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money&quot;.  I love the vocal at the end, &quot;1-2-3-4-5-6-7, etc,&quot; it's quite haunting.  The two suites that end the album, &quot;Sun King - Bathroom Window&quot; and &quot;Golden Slumbers - The End&quot; are damn impressive.  The first suite is the more rocking, for me right up there with &quot;I Want You&quot; as the album's high point.  More impressive lead guitar in &quot;Polythene Pam.&quot;  The second suite begins with the mellow &quot;Golden Slumbers,&quot; a lullebye sung by Paul.  Again, his screaming gets on my nerves, but the irony of this is not lost on me.  This segues right into the terrific &quot;Carry That Weight,&quot; with its catchy hook.  My other small (very) problem with this suite is the somewhat forced segue from &quot;Carry&quot; to &quot;The End.&quot;  &quot;The End&quot; itself is a grand finale, containing the famous axiom &quot;and in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.&quot;  True indeed.  &quot;Her Majesty,&quot; the last &quot;hidden&quot; track is a wonderful short acoustic doodle sung by Paul.  A very satisfying end to one of the masterpieces of the age.  <br />As I wrote in the beginning, I have loved classic rock for many years, mainly from the 70's.  Although I knew many Beatles songs, it wasn't until I heard these albums as a whole that I truly understood the breadth of ideas generated by this band and stolen by so many others.  Oh well.  I guess in music, being blatently ripped off is the ultimate compliment.  That and having your songs covered by Sinatra (as Harrison's &quot;Something&quot; was.)
B00005RFQ5|5.0|Prince has dropped another mesmerizing album on the nations! (Sad to say, the corporate owned radio stations will not play it!!) If you are a music lover who is tired of the corporate (...) (NSYNC, Michael Jackson, Backstreet boys,Brittney Spears, Destiny's Child, etc.), THE RAINBOW CHILDREN is your release from the corporate \\"sheep\\" music.  If you don't understand the message, listen to it ten more times.  If you still don't get, listen to it 100 more times. If you don't get it after that, well, you don't have taste!  <br />I read a lot of reviews stating that this album doesn't compare to PURPLE RAIN or SIGN OF THE TIMES. To an extent the reviewers are correct. THE RAINBOW CHILDREN stands out by itself by using a combination of jazz fusion, funk, and rock.  This album is a true classic!

B00003CXC6|5.0|This is Kurosawa's masterpeice.  He was the greatest director in the history of film(the head of the American Film Institute also shares this opinion...it is not ventured lightly)and this is the greatest of his achievements.  He probably made four out of the ten greatest films ever, but 200 years from now this is the one film students will study endlessly.  From the exquisite pacing to the stunning cinematography to the classic story of the terrible unknowable nature of truth and the effect of perception on it, it perhaps never will be equaled.  Go ahead and rent it and see for yourself.  Then, like me, you will want to own it on DVD.

B00005R23Z|1.0|I just picked up Gattaca (Superbit version), and I was extremely disappointed. Don't get me wrong, this film deserves 6 stars if there was such a thing, but the Superbit DVD is absolutely awful. There are no special features, only the movie and captions. No special features means no trailers, notes, commentary, or deleted scenes; just about everything that makes DVDs feel worth buying. Not to sound melodramatic or anything, but I feel so cheated and heart-broken by buying the Superbit version of Gattaca. So this is just a warning to everyone hoping to own this masterpiece on DVD: DO NOT BUY THE SUPERBIT VERSION!... BUY THE REGULAR DVD!... NOT ONLY DOES IT HAVE EXTRA FEATURES BUT IT'S ALSO CHEAPER TOO!...
B000007MVD|4.0|This two disc set, first released in 1994, was the first substantial officially released project, backed by the folks at Apple, that contained previously unreleased performances from the Beatles since &quot;The Beatles Live at the Hollywood Bowl&quot; in 1977 (which is still out of print).  Although many bootleggers out there already had much of this stuff, it was a gift to those who did not have the BBC bootlegs or simply could not afford them.  And here they were, some fifty songs taken from those weekend radio stations, all in one place, all at a semi-affordable, 2CD set price.  (Even though the set omits &quot;Lend Me Your Comb,&quot; it did show up on &quot;The Beatles Anthology 1&quot; in 1995).  Now, the music.  It is really a blast to hear the Beatles stomp through many of their favorite rock n' roll songs.  Covers of &quot;Young Blood,&quot; &quot;Lucille,&quot; &quot;Sweet Little Sixteen,&quot; &quot;The Hippy Hippy Shake&quot; and &quot;Ooh! My Soul&quot; are fiery and exhuberant, and rock with as much gusto as the early Rolling Stones records.  The highlight has got to be &quot;Some Other Guy,&quot; which is often featured in documentary footage of the Beatles playing at the Cavern Club in Liverpool.  There is only one original, previously unreleased Beatles composition here, &quot;I'll Be On My Way.&quot;  The song is easily one of the weaker Lennon/McCartney compositions (it even has a moon/june rhyme).  In general, the performances of their originals do not have the verve of their officially released versions of these songs (notable exceptions being &quot;I'm a Loser,&quot; and their covers of &quot;Baby It's You&quot; and &quot;Matchbox&quot;).  For instance, on &quot;A Hard Day's Night,&quot; the tricky piano solo, played by George Martin on the record, is inserted into the middle of the live performance here because Harrison had not yet figured out how to play that part.  Things like this simultaneously add and detract charm from this 2CD set.  While the live versions of many early Beatles favorites offer no improvement over the available versions, the exhuberance uncovered in the cover versions (as well as their humor in-between performances) make this set worth owning, even for the Beatle amateur.  When I first purchased this in 1994, it single-handedly made me interested in early rock n' roll, which I had previously (and stubbornly) dismissed as uninteresting.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I didn't think it could be done, but No Doubt have brought the early 1980's into the present. If you lived through the early 80's and saw the dawn of MTV and witnessed the birth of New Wave, then I would think you'd like &quot;Rock Steady&quot;. The first thing that struck me is how the sounds used here reminded me of the early New Wave music I grew up with (and so did Gwen and the rest of the band). Unlike many of the other reviewers here, I think &quot;Rock Steady&quot; is another jewel in No Doubt's crown. All the songs are approximately four minutes or less, there's a good deal of variation in the songs, they don't copy the past as much as they borrow it and make it theirs, all the songs are pretty memorable and catchy. What else could I want in a cd? Plenty of hits are here if radio is willing, like &quot;Hella Good&quot;, &quot;Hey Baby&quot;, &quot;Making Out&quot;, &quot;Underneath It All&quot;, &quot;Detective&quot;, &quot;Start The Fire&quot; and &quot;In My Head&quot;. Many of the songs reminded me of other bands that I grew up with and enjoyed like The Cars (Only In My Head), Prince (Waiting Room), UB40 (Start The Fire, Rock Steady, Underneath It All), The Specials/Madness (Making Out, Detective, Don't Let Me Down). No Doubt borrow, not steal, the past and tinker with it to make it their own, and I think the results are very pleasing. Also add the stellar list of producers like Prince, Ric Ocasek (The Cars), Nellee Hooper (Sould II Soul, Massive Attack, Madonna), William Orbit (Madonna) and you've got a recipe for great music. Gwen's lyrics are clever, though they may not be as personal as on &quot;Return Of Saturn&quot; or &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;, but I don't think the band wanted to do that this time. The cd sounds exuberant and upbeat, and it sounds like a tribute to the 1980's which was musically irreverant and experimental for a time. The enhanced features were interesting too. Particularly Gwen's narration of how &quot;Rock Steady&quot; was made and came together. Plus you get the video for &quot;Hey Baby&quot; which is entertaining. All in all, I can't understand why so many reviewers don't appreciate this cd.and came together. Plus you get the video for &quot;Hey Baby&quot; which is entertaining.

0553277472|2.0|&quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot;, by Robert Prisig just didn't click with me. After I completed the book I checked Amazon.com and browsed through some of the recent reviews. Many of the reviews were favorable. Some even hinted that the book was life changing. Personally I felt the book was extremely boring and at times I even found myself thinking, what the.... Well you know the rest. It wasn't until about three-quarters of the way through the book that I found anything interesting or meaningful in the story. For those of you who found meaning in Mr. Pirsig's book I appauld you. If not may I suggest another book with a simmiliar title called Zen and the Art of Archery by Eugen Herrigel.
B000002H5I|5.0|The song &quot;Fast Car&quot; is as insightful,poignant,and revealing as any Dylan or McCartney-Lennon song.Simply an incredible masterpiece that comes around every 25 or 30 years or so.The song has the most honest reading of any song certainly of the 80's and 90's when honesty didn't matter. That's why this song endures and thats why it took America by storm that year and freezes us in our tracks even today whenever we hear it played on the radio-no matter how much we try to deny it.
B000001U3K|5.0|This album is great.  Anyone who knows anything about good music and good creative musicians will own this.  You can't be a true music snob until you have this record.<br />It features Reed before he opens up into his very metallic and introspective Berlin phase.  Lou's lost the Velvets (for better or worse) and is looking to really get his name out there as a musical heavyweight.  He takes Coney Island and Time Square and rolls them into a hotdog covered with heroin and transexualism and asks you to partake in a feast of weirdness.<br />This work's most accessible tunes are &quot;Walk On the Wild Side&quot; and &quot;perfect Day&quot;.  While most people are familiar with these songs via recyclings of the songs Reed original interpretations stand as monuments to indie lo-fi recording.<br />Must have.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Pearl harbor is the best movie of all time. Not only does it have hot Actors in it. See i'm the kinda person he really doesn't get History but this movie i reamber the date it took place i reamber the speach Franklen D.

For me i liked both it is a very sad and happy movie together. I love this movie and i would rather watch a very good movie and if u need a good cry.
B00000JGOH|4.0|It's romantic, it's sweet, it's luminous and you don't have to turn your brain off.<br />If that's not enough to entice you away from predicable and sappy romantic movies to a higher plane I don't know what will.<br />Cozy up on the couch with your best girl and have a nice night.
B00003CXXS|3.0|Jurassic Park III would have been a decent movie, if it had just a little more originality.  The graphics weren't too much improved from the original Jurrasic Park, and the story was just downright unoriginal and boring.<br />I still liked III, it was a watchable flick, but I am glad that I only rented it, and not bought it.
B00005JKQX|5.0|Great acting by Russell Crowe combined with a great story and great direction make this a winner movie.  At times I was almost amazed at how well Crowe played his part... very real &amp; honest without overacting.  I wish I could express more.
0783225970|5.0|Coolest movie, ever.  No, don't even say it.  It WAS the coolest movie ever.  I do think children should see this movie just like Traffic (except the chainsaw scene in Scarface).  Next time you take a hit or toke up think about people who died and what they went through so you can have &quot;fun.&quot;
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Original and challenging, it deserves repeated viewing. As Kidman herself recognised, it's not for everyone, so why does every malcontent with a grievance insist on (unhelpfully) telling us how they failed to join in the fun and did little more than regret the emptying of their popcorn containers half way through? It may not be entirely successful, but bloody hell, I'd rather spend my money on something that took a real risk in this world of the generic and in the case of this movie wore its heart on its sleeve and recognised that a story about the past produced at the turn of the next millenium was going to be influenced by the culture (and pop-culture) of its own era. What's more, the Like a Virgin sequence, among others for that matter, is absolute inspired lunacy! For a moment I didn't know whether to be repulsed or to laugh. I chose the latter - but at least I was given the choice. And there are so many moments when the serious is juxtaposed or even expressed with apparent sincerity through material that seems curiously at odds with the seriousness of the drama. While the story line may be simplistic, no denial there, the role that the audience is meant to play in this piece is a complex and finally gratifying one. Thanks Baz for suggesting that as a film goer I do have something to bring into the cinema other than my wallet and bags of annoyingly distracting &quot;munchies&quot;. We'll be talking about this film long after many other &quot;worthy&quot; efforts have finished their reruns on pay TV. Terrific, would love to see more from this director. In all an honest film that highlights, rather than slyly disguises its artificiality and that of the musical; and of the motion picture for that matter. <br />NB. The DVD extras are the best you'll see anywhere.
B00003CXN4|5.0|I thought the pace/presentation of subject matter was intense.  The comic relief was wonderfully timed imho, and helped balance out the severity and seriousness of other roles.  The movie also did a great job of 'bringing home' the personal cost associated with the drug war.  Four point five stars.  Well worth the price.
B000002J6F|5.0|I discovered CSNY's Deja Vu and weed at the same time in my senior year of high school, when these four guys were reaching their creative zenith. Their power, intensity and passion in the early 70's was about at the peak of music as I knew it. I think I recognized (deja vu) right then that these men and their friends would be the soundtrack of my life. As I systematically collected all I could get my hands on of C's, S's, N's & Y's material over the next several years, I find that Steve Stills Manassas double album (along with Crosby's &quot;If I Could Only Remember My Name&quot;, Dave Mason's &quot;Alone Together&quot;, Wishbone Ash's &quot;Argus&quot; and the New Riders of the Purple Sage's &quot;NRPS&quot;) has withstood the test of almost 30 years of replay on my turntables, cassette decks and cd-players, and these five albums are at the top of my Desert Island Scenario. I was always a fan of what the Lords of Rolling Stone dubbed &quot;country-rock&quot;, so I was thrilled with the sound of &quot;The Wilderness&quot; (section 2 of this album) coming from one of my rock'n'roll heroes. But if I had to pick only one &quot;side&quot; of this multi-faceted lp as my favorite, it would be &quot;Consider&quot;......no, wait, it would be &quot;Rock & Roll is Here to Stay&quot;.....no, wait, I have to have it ALL! The hair on the back of my neck still prickles when I hear Stills on the wah-wah pedal (The Love Gangster, The Treasure), even though I know every note of every song by heart. Every man on this lp is a consummate professional, and the combination of talent became a force all its own, exceeding the individual efforts. Interesting that the liner notes say, &quot;In Tribute: Jimi Hendrix-Al Wilson-Duane Allman&quot;. For me, this music still sparkles, it's &quot;the treasure of the one-ness, that like sand becomes a diamond before the wind&quot;.....thru the years I've fantasized about being Stills' &quot;gypsy woman, deepest in the world&quot;. I've invested in aspare cd of this one, that I put away without even opening. It is beyond my comprehension why no classic rock stations give airplay to any of the songs on this album. This one will be a lifelong companion for me.
0453007902|5.0|This is an UNABRIDGED reading of the Steinbeck classic, and it is wonderful.  My juniors loved it, and so did I.  Can't wait until next year when I teach this book again!  Gary Sinise does an amazing job making distinct all the characters in this novel.  One would think other people are reading these characters, but it is all Gary.  The movie that Mr. Sinise directed and starred in is also wonderful.  We all loved it!
B000002MFN|4.0|I am one of the BIGGEST Madonna fans in the world and I think one of the best informed and sometimes one of the more critical fans. First off I need to say that this album is exceptionalal. To all those people that say it is not that good--do you know the term concep album? There are many stand out tracks on this album like Bad Girl, Waiting, Words, Rain, and so on. This album may be however her most detached work to date but that does constitute a bad album. This album is very tongue in cheek if you really take the time to listen. To anyone interested do not pass this one up--you won't forgive yourself
0446677450|2.0|Robert Kiyosaki discusses his experience with his two fathers. One of which is actually his father, while the other is his friends. Kiyosaki explains his experiences in his childhood through which he has learned different lessons from each father. One of which was rich while the other was poor. Each story that he tells has a lesson behind it. Even though both give Robert advice, he mostly takes financial advice from his rich dad. His rich dad has experience in business while his poor dad is highly educated. However, education does not account for much in business.  The poor dad explains how education is a fundamental in business, while the rich dad explains that street smarts are more important. A point is that people who want to be rich should do background and research in order to be prepared.<br />i enjoyed the book, however i am not a fan of authors who go extremely into detail....definetly dont buy it...check it out from a library...if you enjoy it...read the others as well
B00005RHGK|5.0|This movie is great, there is nothing wrong with it. Yes it has a story and a weird somewhat plot, its not too violent, yet in my opinion very scary. People today who are expecting this to be like friday the 13th,exorcist,scream, ect. will be dissapointed because it isnt. It is even way better then that, because this in my opinion is one of the most original horror stories ever especially the lay out of the characters. The actors are excellent, you can really feel their fear in this film. I mean just imagine seeing a creature like the one in this movie in real life, no matter what you say it would be terrifying. Anyone who doesnt like this movie, thinks its bad whatever, well this just isnt your type of film not because you thought it was a waste of time but because you didnt watch it like you shouldve and taken time to sit and try to get into it. I saw this movie 4 times in the theatre and the whole time the entire audience was quite, including the sometimes annoying youth. All eyes and ears need to be focused on this movie the whole time or you will lose it and not get it whats going on so of course it would seem like an odd show to you. And anyone who loves horror movies this has got to be a for you it is a true horror movie, and in a way is very realistic maybe not the creature but just the layout, the timing and the fear in these people that go through all this. Enjoy the movie if you enjoy roller coaster rides, and there is no point to ruin the ending but that is the only bad thing about this film is the ending but its still worth it, and there will be a sequel, can you say vengeance? lets hope so, anyway get this movie its outstanding.
0553801481|5.0|If I had to relate them to one of my other favourite things (food), I would say that Robin Hobb's novels are like a Black Forest cake. Bitter, yet rich and entirely satisfying. Of course, that's all a bit absurd, but then I would say that other generic types of fantasy are sponge cake by comparison. <br />FitzChivalry is not your atypical hero emboldened by unbelievable powers who becomes near-invincible and defeats the overwhelmingly evil and disgusting godlike villain (and thank god for that). Hobb has instead given him an individual voice, depth, complexity (flaws), and real heart. Much like most of her other characters. It is refreshing to say the least. <br />The storyline is engaging and conceivable, and although it does not contain as many threads as in the original 'Royal Assassin' trilogy, it is still absorbing - well perhaps 'absorbing' is an understatement; I read the whole book in a single sitting. <br />I am eagerly looking forward to the next instalment from this talented author.
B000056K04|3.0|Ok, so this is not the greatest Dave album ever released, but no one should blame them for this disapointment.  Every great band has a sub-par release and i guess that was the case for this album.  Sure, we all love the old stuff, and I'm sure DMB will return back to that in their next album.  However, we can't look past the fact that there are some amazing songs on this cd, like everyday. Ok, so we all feel like breaking the disk when I did it somes blasting into our ears, but take the good with the bad.  Look forward to the next cd from the greatest band of the present day.
0385505833|5.0|Again, Grisham shows his readers that there is another side to him!  I hope he continues writing books like this and &quot;A Painted House&quot; from time to time!
0375703764|4.0|This book is actually two books in one--one good, one bad. The story of the eerie house, with an immense dark space inside, like the immense, surreal world of dreams contained within each of us that is at the same time larger than the brain that contains it, is excellent, in spite of the second story's--the tattooer's apprentice/editor--worst efforts. The edginess and aspirations of the avant garde and the onion-skin layering of plots are interesting but, frankly, unnecessary. Ditto the warped page layouts that creep in as the book gets thicker--Shakespeare managed to write volumes of brilliance without once feeling the need to resort to typographical gimmicks. Nevertheless, the story is good enough to tell itself over the din of BS that Danielewski tries to drown it out with. It is one of the best newer books I've read. If Truant had been truant from its pages, it might have been one of the best books I've ever read.
B00003CXDV|5.0|When I first heard of the premise of Galaxy Quest it reminded me of &quot;The Three Amigos&quot;; actors trying to be their characters.  I didn't especially care for Tim Allen, and wasn't anxious to see it, but saw it on cable one night and enjoyed it.  I've seen it many times since then, and it just keeps getting better.  There are many lines and bits that make me laugh when I see them coming.  It is a great spoof on fading celebrity in general and Star Trek in particular. It definitely transcends its genre.
B00001QEE5|5.0|What a treat, to be as thrilled with a movie as my two year old is. PAN PAN PAN !  That's all we hear in our house now!
6305603847|5.0|There is no doubt that this DVD is one of the best musical stories around, but why their live, 1980 performance of &quot;The Wall&quot; and also the 1994 performance of &quot;Pulse&quot; are not published in DVD?
B00003CXSP|5.0|Good movie. Hopefully you make a good desicion and buy HANNIBAL on DVD. The movie itself gets four stars but the extra features are so good I gave it an extra star. Same case with THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, only I'd  give the movie 5 stars. BUY NOOOOOOOWWWWW!
B00004SU5J|4.0|.........at last, I have FINALLY figured out the marketing strategy behind the &quot;acid jazz&quot; movement.<br />I enjoy the sounds, to an extent, but the problem I have with this and other similar recordings is simply THIS----<br />There seems to be 2 distinguished sides to the acid jazz movement, the first, as PERFECTED by St Germain is the &quot;lowest common denominator&quot; approach, that is, TAKING A NICE 1 TO 3 CHORD VAMP WITH NICE CHORD INVERSIONS, PUT A FUNK, HIP-HOP,  TRANCE ,HOUSE ETC, whatever ya calls it... PERCUSSIONS GROOVE, AND HAVE A SOLO OR TWO ON TOP (OF VARIED DEGREES OF PROFICIENCY, FROM EXCELLENT TO THE MOST MEDIOCRE).<br />The &quot;composition&quot; seems to usually be heavily to completely sampled.<br />This describes &quot;Tourist&quot;, which has a different &quot;groove&quot; on each track. SAD , seems to me, friends--  that the  tracks on this cd, (except &quot;Montego Bay...&quot; which features the excellent guitar of Ernest Ranglin, the magnificent Jamaican jazz guitarist) goes anywhere, STYLE, but no substance--Huesitos sin ALMA, amigos!! I dont hear a person's &quot;soul&quot;, I hear a &quot;concept&quot;!<br />THIS IS DANCEFLOOR MUSICS, OR OTHERWISE REALLY REALLY HIP &quot;ELEVATOR MUSIC&quot; so It does have some validity to me.,<br />If i aint &quot;dancin' &quot;, I'll put the cd  on when I'm reading a book or doing some chore.<br />---DONT GET ME WRONG, this cd sounds very nice, it just seems to lack true fire and emotion for me, outside of the Ranglin assisted track I mentioned.  Maybe also the track &quot;So Flute&quot;, which can bring me to fond memories of my favorite flute practicioners, Hermeto Pascoal, Roland Kirk(Raaaaaaaaahsaaaan!!!!), and even Frank Wess!(Do you young guys know Mr Wess??-incredible alto/flautista!)<br />Anyway, I seem to like &quot;fase 2 &quot; of the acid jazz trip, the recycled funk jazz/soul sounds, as done quite NICELY by this fellow Bluey Maunick and Incognito! (Man, I LIKE what he is doing, even if it is derivative of ALL the style I grew up with). He's got the thing going! I think if the guy behind St Germain could put some &quot;soul&quot; into it, he would really be a winner.<br />Im givin him 4 stars anyway, for a good start. Some human emotion will really give his recordings a boost, but I think he's found his &quot;niche&quot;, and can give a good hoot what i think, hehehehehehehehehe.........even if it is derivative of ALL the style I grew up with). He's got the thing going! I think if the guy behind St Germain could put some &quot;soul&quot; into it, he would really be a winner.<br />Im givin him 4 stars anyway, for a good start.

B00005TT77|4.0|After hearing some of the songs on the radio, I wanted to get this album, and I wasn't disappointed.  Usually I like heavier music, but this is light without being cheesy or getting miles away from the originals.  Great album if you want to relax or read, something like that.<br />&quot;Two of Us&quot;: I think this is a very good cover.  It kept the jaunty beat, and I think whoever put this on the trailer of the movie was very smart, since I always think of the movie when I hear the song.<br />&quot;Blackbird&quot;: This song is OK, by either Paul McCartney or Sarah McLachlan.  It's not a favorite, though.<BR>&quot;Across the Universe&quot;: This is the best cover on the entire album!!!  Reminds me of a rendition in the Anthology, without the sitar.  I can tell Rufus Wainwright really loves this song; he blows the roof off of it.  It's pretty fun to sing harmony with him.  <BR>&quot;I'm Looking Through You&quot;: I like this, just because it's a little different than most stuff the Wallflowers do.  The guitar part is a little goofy, in a good way--it makes me laugh.<BR>&quot;You've Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot;: Eddie Vedder can sing?  I'm glad he doesn't sound like he does in that one Pearl Jam song about the car accident (ugh).  Here, he doesn't try to sound like John trying to sound like Bob Dylan.  I like this song, but it's starting to get overplayed here.  <BR>&quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;: The whole thing is good, with Ben Harper putting his own spin on the singing...until the end,  The end is too busy, but you can always just go to the next track before that happens.<BR>&quot;Mother Nature's Son&quot;: I don't know if Sheryl Crow's trying to sound like Stevie Nicks or what.  Otherwise, a good remake, esp. with the banjo, a good addition.<BR>&quot;Golden Slumbers&quot;: I thought Ben Folds would do something more about this, being on a piano and all.  I do like his vocals better than Paul's, though.  <BR>&quot;I'm Only Sleeping&quot;: This is favorite Beatles song.  I guess it's a good effort on the Vines's part, but it's too fast!  And I don't know if it's just my car, but there's too much high hat.  The ending isn't cool like the backwards guitar; they sound like they were pressed to figure it out right quick.<BR>&quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot;: I like this cover by the Stereophonics.  It's not too far from John's original, and the vocals express the same feeling.<BR>&quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot;: I don't know what Chris Robinson's problem is on this track.  Otherwise, the Black Crowes do OK with the whole &quot;on an acid trip&quot; feel.<BR>&quot;Julia&quot;: Chocolate Genius pretty much sinks this song.  <BR>&quot;We Can Work it Out&quot;: I've never thought that a woman could sing this, but Heather Nova does so pretty well.  <BR>&quot;Help!&quot;: The intro that Howie Day does is interesting, different from the original in a good way.  It's on the low side of OK.<BR>&quot;Nowhere Man&quot;: I was surprised how stripped down this song is compared to John's original.  I can see how Paul Westerberg's version fits into the movie, which is important for a soundtrack.<BR>&quot;Revolution&quot;: Grandaddy's version isn't as rock-and-roll as the one where John does that awesome thing with his guitar in the intro.  I think they should've slowed it down (like the first version) if the vocals were this toned down.<BR>&quot;Let It Be&quot;: Not really a good song to cover in the first place, and Nick Cave doesn't really make this a booming, huge song like it should be.<br />The album is huge in the beginning, but then it fades away with some questionable renditions and a lack of big names.  I think the bigger names (Vedder, Crow, Harper) might have been spread around the album to help carry it.  But all in all, definitely a fun album to have.  Usually, as a Beatles fan, I would stay away from this type of album, but it's a good tribute and a great soundtrack.
B00003CXB2|3.0|This movie is undeniably a classic.  But did they have to play the same music over and over again?<BR>And why 2 discs?<BR>The story, if we could make the fiction from the truth, would be interesting. Unfortunately, I am not much of an history buff.<BR>So, it is a good epic.  Epic being the key word.
B00005R87Q|4.0|Those looking for an anecdote to last year's lackluster exhaust dispenser &quot;Gone in Sixty Seconds&quot; should find a comfortable remedy in &quot;The Fast and the Furious,&quot; which practically ignites the screen in a blaze of frenzied excitement. The story behind the amazing action set-pieces and drag races is mediocre at best, but that's the extent of its shortcomings, as it grips us in a rocket ride of tension and suspense that makes Bruckheimer's flick look like a three-legged race. <br />The beauty of this movie is its ability to rise above the level of its premise, which any sensible person will be able to see through. It centers around Los Angeles cop Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), who has been given an undercover assignment to locate the lifters of stolen electronics. The manner in which the goods are stolen leads Brian to the street racing gangs that populate the night streets; their leader, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel), is skeptical of Brian's arrival, but takes him under his wing when he rescues him from pursuing cops after a drag race. <br />Then things start getting tricky: Brian finds himself falling in love with Dom's sister, Mia (Jordana Brewster), while also learning of a feud between Dom and a rival street racing gang led by Johnny Tran (Rick Yune). After finding gross amounts of electronic equipment in Tran's garage, Brian returns to his headquarters with his newfound information, but it turns out to be a mislead, and he must start facing the fact that Dom's gang is the one responsible for the thefts. <br />The plot is pretty basic, reminiscent of a dozen previous undercover cop movies in which a person's loyalty to his occupation is tested by a forged friendship with the enemy. Given the fact that Brian's undercover status must, at some point, be revealed to his new friends, the movie follows a fairly predictable route in which we know what will happen next. The FBI, as portrayed in the film, is also pretty lax in their efforts, and after a fewbeginning scenes, they are much better left discarded from memory. <br />Despite these minor speed bumps, &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; manages to engage the audience with a stunning array of stunts, special effects, and full-speed-ahead action that never stops moving until the blazing, rip-roaring final chase. In a way, the film's predictability works in its favor, allowing us to focus our attention on what's most important, and that is director Rob Cohen's amazing knack for intensity. Employing an edgy, hardcore techno soundtrack to accompany his magnificent visual thrills, Cohen supercharges each moment with raw, unrelenting suspense. <br />Take, for instance, the beginning drag race, which pits four drivers against one another amidst a terrific crowd of grunge teenagers and gang members. With the use of extreme quick cuts that take us from close-ups of the drivers to the blur of the cars as they pass bystanders, the scene is given a momentous amount of energy, expertly conveying the rush of adrenaline as each speedometer climbs higher. As the action begins to tie itself more to the story, we soon bear witness to such heart-pounding, breathless scenes such as the botched lifting of stolen goods from an armed trucker, and the final chase sequence, which crowns the film in a blaze of horse-powered glory. <br />The film's cast is equally involving, employing the talents of Diesel and Walker and using them to its full advantage. Walker's credibility as an undercover cop is questionable at times, but he gets the job done with credible results. It is Diesel, however, who steals the show: his brazen demeanor, from his bulging biceps and muscular build to his gruff voice and heavy-duty attitude, all give off the unstable intensity needed to make his character completely unpredictable in the face of such familiar material. His presence is felt with as much tension as the action itself, and this role, if nothing else, should prove his worth as a great actor who knows what he's doing. <br />As summer fare, &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; is a cut above the rest, and provides more than enough excitement for those of us who have found this summer's movie season to be somewhat lacking. The film has its shortcomings, but it doesn't concern itself with trying to cover them up or better itself. It keeps our attention, as well as its own, on the superb array of drag races, revving engines, and high-speed chases that are edge-of-your-seat fun from beginning to end.
B000005IU1|5.0|While some artists, like the Rolling Stones and the Byrds, moved away from psychedelia in the late 60's by returning to their country and blues roots, Iggy and the Stooges took music in a new direction - the road to nihilistic punk and hard core.  It all started here.  To fully appreciate this album, you have to remember that it was released the same year that Ringo Starr invited us to play in an &quot;Octopus's Garden&quot; and raindrops kept falling on B.J. Thomas's head.  There was some pretty fluffy stuff floating around.  Then Elektra records caught a whiff of the Stooges, and music would never be the same.  These apathetic wastes didn't give a damn about a damn thing, flushing romanticism down the toilet and disowning complex musical structures in favor of a following of high school dropouts (Iggy's admitted target audience).  Unfortunately, nobody bought the record in 1969.  Everybody just copied it later on.  Punk may have been chiefly British in the late 70's, but none of it would have happened without the Stooges and the Velvet Underground in America.  <br />The songs are nothing brilliant, and all about the same, with Iggy angry or apathetic about something, or wanting to get into some girl's pants, but the young savagery in the execution is enough to carry the album. The guitar work sounds jaded and reckless, and suits the songs perfectly.  The only unintentionally sour note is the ten-minute &quot;We Will Fall,&quot; an Indian-influenced groaner that doesn't capture the Stooges' strengths at all.  Fortunately, the rest of the set makes up for it.
B00005JKQX|4.0|&quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; proves just how much effective performances can carry a movie. Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly are the centerpiece of this biopic of John Forbes Nash, Jr, and throughout the movie's entire, they remain as such, due to the fact that director Ron Howard doesn't seem to have a knack for giving the film a steady pace. <br />This is a shame, given the incredible acting on the part of Crowe, who plays Nash's paranoia and delusional schizophrenia in a most moving fashion. Beginning with his years at Princeton University, we bear witness to Nash's constant roaming of his mind to try and come up with something original and important that will scribe his name in history. His roommate, Charles (Paul Bettany), urges him to get out more, to get to know the people he goes to school with, but Nash presses on until he comes up with the paper that gets him the credentials he needs to go anywhere in life. <br />After attaining a professorship at MIT, things are going well for him, until he crosses paths with William Parcher (Ed Harris), a government official who warns him of a Russian conspiracy that hopes to smuggle a portable nuclear weapon into the country. As he explains it, there are spies working within the United States, and communication among their network depends on secret codes and messages embedded within the articles of newspapers and periodicals. Nash, who rises to the challenge of cracking these codes, takes on the top-secret assignment. <br />Up to this point, Howard has done well to set up Nash's life in a manner that keeps us wanting to know more about him. His years at Princeton contain a variety of uplifting and downtrodden moments, and his government assignment carries with it a sinister, unknown element that sets up the film's second half. Nash's marriage to Alicia, while making him the happiest man on earth, throws a wrench in Parcher's plans, as Nash's married life and his forthcoming child requires more of his attention. He begins warning Nash that Russian spies are on the lookout for him; later, at a math conference at Princeton, he is taken away by strange men, all the while screaming for help in vain. <br />At this turn of events, the film becomes a powerful one, creating a very unsettling atmosphere that brings home the reality of schizophrenic delusions with effective results. The government assignment, Parcher, Charles and his young niece... all the figments of Nash's vivid and often nightmarish imagination. The men he believes to be the Russian spies he was warned about are, in reality, psychiatrists trying to calm the storm of his mind, while Alicia remains hopeful yet suspicious of her husband's stability. <br />Despite Ron Howard's camera trickery and treatment of Nash's delusions, Crowe's acting is the life force of his character's situation. The fact that life as he knows it has been called into question is very disturbing, and watching him hold onto these visions is even more tense. Crowe is able to portray Nash in such a way that we feel a great deal of emotion for him, and care for him enough to want to see him reach a certain sense of stability in life. <br />Jennifer Connelly, relatively unknown to most until this film, portrays Alicia Nash with the caring and supportive nature that is needed to balance her character's feelings of devotion with the unbearable need to break free. Her acting is strong and able, and when crossed with that of her costar, the two become the life force of the film, the source of all things important to the story. <br />All of this is put into extreme jeopardy, however, by Howard's inadequate pacing and awkward directing, keeping the film slow and melodramatic in places where it should be concise and intense. The entire movie is cast in a drab cloud of slow movement that is almost aggravating, threatening to bring down the film's many touching moments. Much of the second and final thirds is crammed with confrontations between Nash and his mind's eye, instead of developing his willpower as he struggles to recover without the help of medication. While this is a heartwarming move on the part of Nash, the film rushes it far too much, and lessens the impact in doing so. <br />In the end, just as its main character, &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; wins over its obstacles to become a better-than-average biopic with some very influential and touching moments, crowned by stunning performances from its two shimmering leads. It's a tearjerker that doesn't evoke too many sniffles, unfortunately, due to our growing sense of disinterest as a result of its deliberately slow pacing. In regards to his film, Howard's mind is in the right place, but his heart is elsewhere.
B00005U122|5.0|I've been waiting a long time for a dvd release of &quot;Pulse&quot;. Well, this will definitely hold me over until then. In fact, I'm not sure which one is closer to a &quot;Floyd experience&quot;.<BR>Just a great performance with awewsome production values.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Star Wars, you either love it, like it, or just don't get it.  <br />Liam Neeson and Ian McGregor together in the same film should be enough to put it over the top, but add in the phenomenon that is Star Wars and you have a classic of science fiction.<br />Neeson brings a depth to the Jedi that even the great Alec Guiness couldnt bring to them in the first movie.  His portrayal of the warrior/philosophers gives one the feeling of finally meeting someone who is what the fans thought a Jedi should be.  <br />McGregors protrayal of his slightly irreverent Padawan learner shows the energy that one would expect of Kenobi's brash youth.<br />If you're a Sci-Fi person, you can't help but go with this one.
B00000J7RZ|2.0|People who go to a store and buy a CD see Jennifer Lopez on the cover and assume she is the talented mastermind behind the whole recording. When in reality she is simply a puppet. A marienette whose strings are controlled by the folks that are actually musically inclined. She can't write, she can't produce and she has absolutely no vocal range to speak of. One thing she does possess is an ego the size of Montana. For the catchy beats, melodies, and rhythms open the cd jacket and recognize a myriad of talented producers, Rodney Jerkins, Corey Rooney, Trackmasters, Will Smith, Sean Combs, Rick Wake, ETC ETC. Sure, she is somewhat attractive, (ugly people won't make it in this high school mind set society) and follows directions well, (Someone taught her to carry a tune). But whenever the producers and songwriters jump on the next big thing and leave her high and dry she shall go the way of Paula Abdul, Debbie Gibson,Samantha Fox, and lets face it Mariah Carey. While you the CD buyer runs to the store to buy a copy of the 'Next big thing's album and the entire process starts all over again.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|For all of you incurable romantics out there, this one you've got to see.  It's your classic &quot;ugly duckling turns into a beautiful swan with the help of a charming prince&quot; story.  Just throw in a little Australian humor and of course the spectacular dancing style of Paul Mercurio and you have a flick that you can watch again and again.  It just makes you feel good, not to mention making you want to take up ballroom dancing.
B00004U2NX|5.0|Wonderfully filmed and deeply sinister (yet not gory).<BR>The classic Bram Stoker novel of 'Dracula' gets the German treatment in this 1979 classic. A worthy remake of the 1922 Murnau masterpiece. Klaus Kinski (who looks like a bald Gary Numan) plays the nefarious Count, a world-weary vampyre with a longing to love and be loved . Isabelle Adjani is the self-sacrificing heroine, a beautiful doll-like creature she is too!<BR>There is a scene in this where a horse and carriage is riding along by a river, yet the wheels are not turning. This is perhaps the films only flaw, but its not something that spoils the film. Yes, some say the pacing is slow, but just relax and take in the atmosphere of this deeply tragic, yet beautiful tale. This is absolutely one of the best vampyre films ever made. Relish it horror fans, this is a gem!
B00005NI5Y|4.0|4 and 1/2 stars<br />This really is timeless music.  Some of these tunes sound as if they were written long ago - based upon the feel of the tune rather than the lyrical content.  This retro-meets-the-present collage helps the album to flow seamlessly.  Bob's voice sounds better than it has in the last decade and the band is excellent.  This disc works better at home than in the car, at those times when one feels free to sit back and be absorbed into the music.
6305594252|4.0|When this first came out I was just beginning middle school.  I considered it my favorite movie.  When I gave my  little sister an amazon gift certificate I remembered likeing it and recommended it(I must be a jackass).  I watched it again and had forgotten how much I loved the effects and the mood of the movie.  This is a ver originol film and unlike most movies you'll see about egypt.  Since I first watched it, however, I have become interested in Egypt, taking courses in college, reading books and journals and even learning hieroglyphs.  I must say now that the writers did NOT understand egypt and their mythology AT ALL.  I know this is sci-fi and you wouldn't expect it to be realistic but this is way off.  The gods look all wrong and the ancient iconography and mythology is way off and misinterpreted.  But that shouldn't matter much.  After all, it's just a story and it's a pretty good one and it's got the visual effects to back it up.
B00004XQ83|5.0|This is truly an amazing album, encompassing music that is incredibly diverse and yet totally American.  While traveling from the field holler of &quot;Po Lazaruth&quot; to the rocking bluegrass of &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot;, the listener is taken on a journey that includes Delta blues, gospel, folk blues, bluegrass, old timey pop, a capella blues and virtuoso acoustic instrumentals.  T-Bone Burnette deserves many congratulations for the production of this soundtrack.  Many of the interpretations here differ significantly from previous existing recordings and I find these to be superior.<br />Most of the disc is top notch.  My favorites include: &quot;Down to the River to Pray&quot;, &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot;, &quot;I'll Fly Away&quot;, &quot;Keep on the Sunny Side&quot;, &quot;I am Weary&quot;, &quot;In the Jailhouse Now&quot; and &quot;Lonesome Valley&quot;.  The recording quality varies slightly from song to song but is excellent.  The sound stage on &quot;Down to the River to Pray&quot; is absolutely huge and if you think the power of the human voice is limited, crank up &quot;Lonesome Valley&quot; to 90 dB and think again.<br />Absolutely essential, desert island selection.
1558908358|5.0|This is a unique film.  I enjoy visual films and the scenes in this movie are amazing.  Never again will anyone make a movie with this unique look and feel(technology has come too far to make something like this again).  But the story gives you a mood that reminds me of the way people viewed technology in the 80s with vast grid like spaces and unthinkably complex computers that are so vast the form an abyss.  The look of the film though ...if we saw it all the time is definitely worth a look.
B00004Z400|5.0|...well next to Around the Fur and Aenema (TooL). Granted I have the silver copy that has no Back to School, but never the less this cd conveys more of an angelical emotion than Adrenaline or ATF. It's funny, I have never seen them on any countdowns or top this or that, but anyone who has heard their music that I have met loves the band. There is no comparison between the Deftones and any other 'nu-metal' bands or otherwise. <BR>As far as the songs go, to me the cd hits an apex at &quot;Change&quot;. It has always been to me kinda straight-forward what he was saying lyrically and the music is just dark enough to set the mood without becoming cheesy. Really though, the entire cd blasts with creativity and a feel that they play a style of music that always feels 'new'. No songs are reptitive but all are amazing, Feiticeira is particuarly great because of the fact that there is no chorus to the song (something that will never happen in most music, in fear that the song might be otherwise forgetble if there is no hook to stay in your head for days.)<BR>Overall this is the 2nd best, but only by a slim margin to ATF. If you don't own this yet I would DEFINATELY get the re-released version because Back to School is VERY good (with a cool video too). Or if possible to do what I did and get the red version as well(extra track being The Boy's Republic).
B00000DC7L|5.0|I am a queen fan.  If you like queen Brian May's unique methods and sound and his ability to rock and spit out emotion at you will make you happy.  It reminds me of queen but it is definitely very different too.  I'd like to talk about each track but there is just too much to say.  If buy this album you will sastisfy a desire to hear hard rock, emotional songs(well not very emotional so that you vomit.  just not emotionless)  and Brian's unique sound.  This is fancy.  Very desirable.  I am a better person having heard it.  Why if I could I would spit on my old self.
B00005U2LM|2.0|...first the fatboys breakup...and now this...<BR>to be honest, this might actually be an outstanding piece of american music...i just cant make it past the fourth track, i've tried and tried, but this sh!t drags....after this, it is official:  i am turnin in my wu-card.
B0000009TJ|5.0|Just from looking at the cover and tracklisting you know this album is good! Every period of Zappa's vast catalogue is covered by this CD and each is exceptionally done. The criticism of some earlier reviews saying that the CD lacks hard rock and soloing is true, but this is not a bad thing...Zappa's music was never always rock and solos. This CD adds a new dimension to the songs being performed. I was blown away by the imaculate performances on every single track. <br />Heavy Duty Judy is fantastic and actually has loud guitar in! wow. Ring of Fire is good as well, an interesting cover, as all the covers are (the Thing-Fish versions of Purple Haze and Sunshine Of Your Love are a bit messed up and could have been much more, but still worthy), but the best cover lies in the Stairway To Heaven solo. Totally transcribed for brass and followed with a guitar solo, this is astounding playing and one of the best moments in 'rock'! The slowed down version of Peaches that is incorporated into Cleveland is beautiful and for me is Zappa through and through. The playing on the start of Zomby Woof is astounding, as is the OSFA suite. The continual lambasting of Swaggart does get trying after a while, but to hear Burt again is great and Torture with horns is genius.<br />So, overall, there isn't really a dud on the 2 discs all the way through so this is a really worthwhile purchase, even if you are a casual Zappa fan.<br />If your friends cannot understand why you worship the man and have nearly 60 of his albums, play them this gem and they will see the light. Definately up there with his best, and better than the other '88 albums...although they are all essential!
B00005QDW1|4.0|I personally didn't like this album at all. I liked a few songs, but I found most of the CD to be quite blah compared to their previous albums. They really strayed from their ska background as well.
B00003CXDZ|1.0|What amazes me most about this film was that it did so much right. <br />Was it visually stunning? Indeed.<br />Was the acting good? It was great. I didn't believe Nicole Kidman could give such a performance. I still think a stunt-double must have done the acting parts for her.<br />Unfortunately, no amount of polish can make up for the fact that the framework of this film is rotten. The story is completely uninspired. And the songs, well... let's just say I was expecting to hear the cast break out into a Boz Scaggs tune at any time (that's NOT a compliment).<br />It amazes me that anyone could find this film enjoyable, and that is not sarcasm.
0064407667|4.0|This book starts of the Series of Unfortunate Events with wicked good fun.  The books are perfect for adults who have already read all of the Harry Potter books and want some light, imaginative reading.  I've read the first seven books in the series, often in between more &quot;serious&quot; literature - a good way to cleanse the palate!  Highly recommended for older children to adults.
6300215717|4.0|It took awhile, but I finally saw this film all the way through and, boy, am I glad I did. It's rare to find an onscreen couple with such great chemistry and magnistism. It's obvious in every moment of the film that Hepburn and Peck were having a marvelous time...or at least that's what they make you believe. This was Audrey's first major film role and it's not hard to see why she became an instant movie star. The camera just loves her and so will you. She plays Anya, a beleaguered European princess, who skips out on her duties just for one day and falls in love with an American reporter, played by the incredibly handsome Gregory Peck. This was the first film I've ever seen with a young Gregory and I have to say that I've really been missing something. I never released how handsome he was. They play off each other's strengths wonderfully, allowing you to really get under the skin of these two characters. <br />You never find out what country Princess Anne is really from, but that doesn't really matter. She's her country's PR person and her presence is in constant demand at every state function under the sun while she's visiting Rome. The strain of having every minute of her time scheduled finally causes her to have a breakdown. Her secretary calls the doctor who gives her something to sleep. However, she escapes the castle before it takes effect and wanders into her own Roman adventure. <br />She luckily finds herself in the very capable and honorable hands of Joe Bradley, a reporter exiled to Rome. He knows that one big story could pave his way back to the United States and once he discovers Anne's true identity he believes he's found his ticket home. What he doesn't anticipate is falling under her spell as she enjoys the only day of true freedom she has ever known. It's all about the money and fame at first, but in the end he just can't make himself blow the lid off her day of adventure. After all, she trusted him...and fell in love. <br />Anne and Joe manage to do just about every fun thing there is to do in Rome in a day and it's fun to watch they're escapades. Though this is a romantic comedy, there are some poignant moments in the film, especially when the couple is forced to part. They never speak of her true identity, but both of them knows that what they're feeling can never exist outside this one stolen moment. It's a film that would never be made today because many people would consider the ending to be unhappy. I just consider it realistic. I have to admit I wanted it to be different, but that's life. <br />It's a somewhat well-known fact that William Wyler wanted to direct this film in color, but I'm glad he didn't get his way. Black and white lends so much more style to movies. The way the light hits Audrey Hepburn's face is pure magic. It makes you concentrate more on the actors than the scenery. Wyler was considered one of the best woman's directors and this film is a pure example of why. This could have been just another hokey romantic comedy, but it's not. It stands the test of time because of the talent involved and the way the story is told. If you're looking for a realistic, fun romance ROMAN HOLIDAY is a must see. I can't wait to watch it again
B000001FKY|5.0|There are very few albums in my collection where I can play the entire album from beginning to end and listen to every song. This is one of them. Even though Def Leppard had changed their sound from Pyromania to Hysteria, this is by far their best album, before or since. They really worked as a team on this album, with very good lyrics and excellent guitars. Fifteen years after its initial release, I still listen to this album. I bought the CD when it was released in 1987, and is still in my &quot;must listen to&quot; catagory. If you buy only one Def Leppard album for your your collection, buy this one. You will be very satisfied.
B00005MP58|5.0|I won't review the movie itself, it's wonderful.  My comments are for the color quality of this new dvd version.  Mine is just fine.  I almost didn't buy it because of all the negative reviews on the color quality.  My dvd is just fine.  Yes, it is light in some scenes but you can certainly see the objects, they don't blend into one another.  Never having watched this on TV or any other format, this dvd is watchable and enjoyable.  I'm glad I made the purchase.  And Colin Firth, that man is HOT!
0385505833|5.0|In my opinion Grisham has written a brilliant novel. I'm sure in the next years it will become a award winning movie played by some of the biggest actors in this business. Grisham starts off by showing reality of everyday life and of a normal family having a hard time dealing with their daughter leaving for Christmas, but it ends up portraying this perfect image of the perfect Christmas in this perfect town. This is a great book and shows the ups and downs of Christmas times.
0671799320|4.0|Although this book is 10 years old and ends its analysis with the Gulf war, this book is invaluable to understanding why we still have troops in the Saudi desert which fuels the rage of Bin Laden and others. Even beyond the gulf war however, Yergen shows why and how we entered into the Faustian bargain of supporting the opressive and undemocratic regimes of the gulf in exchange for cheap oil.<br />As Yergen makes clear, because of our dependance on oil of the mideast and it is sometimes an impossible balancing act to both supporting our traditional ally Israel while at the same time placating oil producing states in which anti-semitism is both ingrained in the political culture and used as a way to deflect political dissent. This tension exploded in 1973 when the arab states embargoed our oil for our support of Israel in the Yom Kippur war. <br />If I were to falt Yergen for anything it would be that he never explains the tensions which run against the oil pressures. For example, he never articulates really any reason for why we supported Israel through the cold war, he just says that this support came under pressure from our need to have cheap oil. <br />More than anything, Yergen brings truth to the recent assertion that to be patriotic you shouldn't fly an american flag from your SUV, rather you shouldn't drive an SUV.
B000001EUL|5.0|LOVEDRIVE was the SCORPIONS at their best. I'm not too familiar<br />with the albums they did before this, but I've heard all the<br />albums they've done since and I don't think they ever topped this. For one, this a very well recorded album; it's very loud,<br />the drums are very crisp and clear and the guitars sound wonder-<br />ful. Secondly, and most importantly, the songs are absolutely<br />fab and show off the band's versatility; from the fast paced and<br />in your face rockers ANOTHER PIECE OF MEAT and CAN'T GET ENOUGH,<br />to the slower paced and melodic instrumental COAST TO COAST(fea-<br />turing some terrific guitar playing by MICHAEL SCHENKER), to<br />the ballads ALWAYS SOMEWHERE and HOLIDAY, to the very catchy<br />IS THERE ANYBODY THERE, which features some unusual(for the SCORPS, that is) percussion playing. My favorite tunes are<br />COAST TO COAST, IS THERE ANYBODY THERE and HOLIDAY.<br />ALSO, YOU GOTTA LOVE that original album cover. if you're a guy,<br />that is!
B00005OAIE|5.0|John has the most unique outlook on life.  I saw him about eight months ago in Salt Lake City with Glen Phillips at a tiny club.  John impressed me then if you get a chance see him in concert and buy his CD.  Don't buy a used CD either support the young talent and buy a new one.
1572522232|4.0|I don't like the violence - it is relentless, gory, blood soaked -  from noses and mouths the blood oozes, makes you want to puke or laugh - nothing in-between. Bloody Italians? Bloody Seventies slasher flicks I say. Accept it for what it is. I don't like the dubbing either but with the sound turned up (as it should be with this film) its not so bad. And I'm not mad on the ending. But how can you end a film like this? Let David Lynch remake it I say.<br />I loved the claustrophobic sets, the eerie lighting, the colours, the predatory move of the camera, the logic of the story which is the logic of a nightmare, that little Bambi creature in the lead with her big eyes that twitch and look around nervously when her friend whispers warnings to her in the dark but what is the big deal?, the scenes that slowly build with a nursery rhyme soundtrack that becomes some sort of creepy european rock, they go on and on and on it makes no sense but that's the beauty of it.<br />The modern day horror spoofs that are supposed to be funny but are more predictable than the films they are trying to parody and not half as frightening are only made because there is no-one around nowadays capable of making a proper horror film, like Suspiria. Well maybe David Lynch. For some reason I would still like to see him remake it.
0345413377|4.0|I have to admit from the start that I've never read Paradise Lost.  After reading this trilogy, though, I think I'm going to.  Pullman's take on the war between Heaven and Hell is refreshing, and made me rethink a number of closely-held beliefs.  I was very impressed with this book- it keeps up the action and suspense of the first two books, but doesn't keep telling the same story.  It covers new ground and expands its scope without becoming totally bizarre, like so many books do several books into the series.  This is one of the few series I've read that kept getting better and better the further I went.  This book has all of the makings of a true epic, even the bittersweet end (think Lord of the Rings, Narnia Cycle, or Prydain Chronicles).
B00005R2M3|2.0|I've liked Shakira since &quot;Pies Dezcalsos&quot; and have followed her work ever since. Unfortunately, even though I have great respect for her work I cannot in good concience give her anything more than 2 stars, or not offer a disenting view in the midst of all the glowing reviews.<br />When the news that Shakira was making an English album I was skeptical. I heard the Spanish version of &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; and I thought it was excellent for the genre.<br />Now for all her virtues as a singer in Spanish, she needs a lot of work in English. Her voice lost most of its impact, the words were completely undecipherable (I had to read the lyrics to understand what she was saying), and the choice of wording was not exactly the best. On top of that &quot;Ojos Así&quot; (&quot;Eyes like yours&quot;) was completely messed up in the reinterpretation.<br />Despite that I really liked all of her songs in Spanish.<br />Here's my advice:<BR>-If you're a hardcore (&quot;old&quot;) Shakira fan its a definite buy (even if you dislike the English songs the Spanish ones should compensate). <BR>-If you're a passive fan listen before you buy.<BR>-If you've heard it all (in particular the ones in English) ignored what I've said before completely as there is a diference of opinion.<br />-A

B00004RFFI|5.0|SPEEDY DELIVERY JUST AS PROMISED AND IN EXC. CONDITION!
B00005TT77|5.0|A fresh look at some old favorites - it's fun to hear some of my favorite artists of today interpret some of my favorite older songs.  It's an extremely solid lineup, including the lesser-known acts whose names you might not immediately recognize.  An enjoyable listening experience, beginning to end.  Some of my favorite tracks are the ones from Eddie Vedder, Aimee Mann &amp; Michael Penn, Sarah McLachlan, and Heather Nova.  All in all, this is definitely a must-have album for anyone who considers themselves a music fan.
B00005RHGK|1.0|I can not believe that there is one of these directors can produce this kind of movie. I can get angry at each character by their actions. I don't khow why when they (Darry and his sister) were getting scared, but stood still to look at what the monster doing, and asking himself &quot;what is this?&quot;. And many other stupid things they did that left questions to audiences. For me, I consider this movie as poor directed and the episode is unreasonable. People have not seen this movie, should not see it, you will feel sorry about it.
B00005UKKF|5.0|I happened to be going to a conference in Vegas the week that Britney was performing at the MGM Grand. I heard Rosie O'Donnel Say on her show that she had just got tickets for the Britney show in Vegas on the 18th of November. Not paying much attention I quickly forgot all about it. The following day I got bored at work and while daydreaming I remembered what Rosie had said and thought, what the heck, &quot;I'll check out the ticket prices&quot;, Figuring that they would be sold out for sure and I had no idea of when they went on sale. Much to my surprise they still had seats available, so I (just to see) typed in 2 seats and I could not believe that the seats were really good and not high priced considering what I have paid recently for concert tickets, like for Madonna. (well worth it though).<BR>Anyway, bought the tickets, went to the show and although compared to the majority of those around me, I felt like a grandpa(I am 30). Even so, as much as I tried to act my age, before I knew it, I was up on my feet and feeling the energy.<BR>I was not expecting much and have to say was embarrased to admit to anyone at home that I was even going. After her incredible show, I have admited to everyone that I am a fan of Britney Spears and you will be too, I guarantee it! I am sure the DVD will be less powerful than seeing it live, but just feel her amazing energy and see her for what she is, A young woman living out her dreams and allowing us to tag along! AMAZING!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|The format of the movie is very intriguing, the plot plays backwards, and you don't find the motivation for any of the characters' actions until after each scene plays out.<BR>This is one of those movies that leave you questioning what really happened; in fact, even more so, because the main character himself has to question what really happened since he can't remember!
B00005JKHP|5.0|I am normally wary of re-released films slapped with the title &quot;Directors Cut,&quot; or &quot;Director's Edition.&quot; I have been burned more than once with these &quot;buzzwords&quot; claiming that I am getting something better, grander, or more relevant than the original version.<br />&quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; is one of those films that fans know has several versions. There is a theatrical version, the 1982 television version with loads of added scenes that many fans thought made the film more watchable, and then there is this DVD; A re-release with new special effects that do not distract you from the film, but actually enhance it, and a different edit that clears up a bit of ambiguity in several scenes.<br />What you get when you buy this DVD is two-discs. I won't go into great detail about the features since they are listed on the main page. But I will tell you why you should buy this product:<br />1) Better sound, and a crisper, cleaner image than previous releases.<br />2) Deleted scenes that are SEPARATE from the actual film. That is, you can view deleted scenes that are not in the body of the film. On a side note, I wasn't too thrilled that some of the so-called &quot;deleted scenes&quot; from the &quot;Star Wars: Episode One: The Phantom Menace&quot; DVD were actually inserted into the body of the film. Why they didn't call it a Special Edition, I don't know. Maybe adding two more words to the title would have made it too long to put on a DVD box?<br />3) The Extras: I haven't even been able to see them all, and that is the hallmark of DVD. You will have loads of material to view with this DVD. I especially enjoyed the documentary section.<br />So, I hope I made a case for this film. If you aren't a Star Trek fan, it IS a Robert Wise film, and anyone who loved the director's work in &quot;West Side Story&quot; would need &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; to round out their Robert Wise collection.<br />As DVD's go, this one delivers the goods.livers the goods.
B00005RHGK|1.0|I rented this movie because I love a good horror movie and because the reviews on ...(this website) were so favorable. When I started watching it, I was reminded of Neve Cambell in \\"Scream\\" when she says people in horror movies always do the exact opposite of what they should.  The two actors in this film did a pretty good job with the pathetic characters they were playing. When the creature comes after them, they stand and watch.  When they should be going to the police, they go back to investigate themselves or sit in the car and again, watch the creature come after them. The whole way through the movie, I was screaming, \\"What are you doing idiot?\\"  I should have asked myself that for watching this stupid film to the end.
B00005QZWI|1.0|If you are planning of listening to this CD on your PC, don't bother because it won't play it.
B00004YMVG|5.0|This is a lovely album for anyone who likes simple and smooth voices and light jazz/bossa nova backgrounds (think Joa Gilberto and Luis Bonfa, but French).  The songs are very melodic with a definate air of melancholy. If you like this album see &quot;Chansons de Amour&quot; which is similar and as good. If you have fallen in love with Salvador be careful, however, because many of his albums repeat songs and a couple of his albums from the 60's and 70's are full of covers of stupid and menacing novelty songs, and the album that is part of a jazz series, &quot;Salvador Sings the Blues&quot;, or similar, is he singing very jazzy lounge stuff with a group, like Lambert, Hendricks, and Ross.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I don't write reviews, but I had to for this one.  I had heard a lot about this movie, good and bad, and now I don't trust anyone's opinions about movies that doesn't like it!  A new way of producing movies, Lurhmann presents us with an inviting, engrosing movie.  I NEVER buy DVDs, but I ran out and bought this one after renting it.  Highly recommend!
0375431624|4.0|I think this book is very well written.The author writes about a family who skips christmas because their daughter leaves for college.Its very well written and easy to read. Anyone that likes christmas can relate to this book.Its funny because it show the krank family's consequences of them skipping christmas and shows true reality of what people go through on the occasion.For example spending a large amounts of money on food like fruitcakes and spending lots of time decorating christmas lights.This story is also very suspensful because you want to know what will happen next.
B000002HJD|5.0|Jim Morrison is the best poet I have ever heard.  Even though his lyrics are a bit on the dark side, there is a certain beauty in them also.  The music that the surviving members have added actually enhances the poetry.  The two compliment each other beautifully.  When Jim died, the world lost a great talent-not only a poet, but a great lyricist as well and a very talented singer.
6303471714|5.0|I used this tape when I first purchased back in 1992, and lost 30 lbs during a reasonable time period.  The workouts tend to be a little fast, especially when you first start, but you can pause the tape and go at your own pace, or as Cindy mentions to do as many reps as you feel comfortable doing.  The big positive about this video is the importance of drinking water during workouts, and working out all parts of the body.  The music used fits well with the workout and is energizing.  I am again using this video, using both workouts (on alternating days).  I like the two workouts because it provides variety and keeps me motivated to exercise.  A little sore at first, but over time keeping with the workouts the soreness lessens, and you see results in energy, tone and weight loss.  Of all the workout tapes I've tried, this one is the best.

B00003CXS4|4.0|Folowing on from the very enjoyable and original low budget Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, this could almost be considered Lock, Stock part II as it reunites most of the cast and crew and it's another gangster movie set in London. However, although the stories are similar there are enough differences and new twists to allow this movie to be considered as a good and original movie in its own right.<br />Snatch starts with some jocular credits, and the robbery of an Antwerp diamond merchant's office by four thieves disguised as Hasidic Jews. Initially appear in black and white on a succession of CCTV screens, then when they reach their target, they're in colour as they grab the guns concealed on the chest of their leader. Seizing an 86-carat, size of your fist, diamond the robbers head to London to sell the stone and of course this is where the fun starts as all types of cockney and foreign misfits then become involved in the theft and counter-theft and attempted sale of said diamond.<br />Among the colourful array of characters on parade this time are jewish jewellers (Mike Reid and Dennis Farina), cockney hardman Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones), a truly disgusting underground fight promoter by the unlikely name of Brick Top (Alan Ford), a Russian hitman - Boris the blade (Rade Serbedzija), a fight manager - Turkish (Jason Statham), and Irish traveller Mickey O'Neill (Brad Pitt). Ultimately the surprisingly excellent Brad Pitt steals the movie as the boxing `yardy' nobody can understand but veteran British actor Alan Ford as the disgusting `Brick Top' runs him close for best performance kudos.<br />Like its predecessor Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch is full of twists and turns and plenty of black humour but unlike its predecessor it's a bit more violent and the language is even stronger. It will probably still be unfairly compared to Tarantino but its still a clever and fun movie. My only criticism of Guy Ritchie would be that he needs to learn that less is sometimes more; the movie doesn't need as many twists and it doesn't need so many alternative showy camera angles and film styles. Don't get me wrong, they're good, just a couple too many. This is a four star movie that could have been five.<br />Pretty much the whole world knows Guy Ritchie's name now. Sadly most people rather insultingly and condescendingly know him as Mr Madonna but just like her first husband cruelly christened Mr Madonna, Sean Penn, Guy Ritchie is a great talent in his own right. However, the acid test of Guy Ritchie's talent will come with his next movie starring `er indoors (as they say in cockney vernacular), the so far allergic to anything resembling believable acting Madonna. If he can get a decent performance out of Mrs Ritchie he truly will be hailed as a genius.t less is sometimes more; the movie doesn't need as many twists and it doesn't need so many alternative showy camera angles and film styles.

B00005U18E|4.0|But then again I almost always think the book is better than the film.  I miss the diary format of the book, especially the report on cigarettes and her weigh-in.  Daniel's role seems to expand in the video, I'm sure in part to justify hiring Hugh Grant.  <br />If you like the video, which any fan of the romantic comedy genre most likely will, read the book.
0553573403|5.0|I've stopped reading Fantasy for a while as writers just kept mining the same sources, ripping off Tolkien or making minor changes. But George RR Martin has bought out a new brand of fantasy that's brilliant and brutal, with no sentimental attachment to characters in a world that's coloured in shades of grey. Nothing is quite what it seems, and there's layers of intrigue and deceit. Definitely a series to convert non-fantasy readers and show that there's more than just Tolkien in the genre.
B000001G5H|5.0|This recording is hands down the best version of Chopin's Etudes currently available, and it's unlikely that any can surpass them.  Pollini plays these devilishly difficult miniatures with stunningly virtuosic technique that cannot be matched.  However, technique alone is not sufficient enough to play these etudes well.  Also necessary is incredible musicianship, which Pollini shows he has in abundance.  There is no Chopin player alive who plays these pieces quite as poetically as does Pollini.  Too often you hear Chopin played as if it were Beethoven with power and feeling but without poetry and lyricism.  Not with Pollini, whose impeccable technique and musicianship allow him to play the etudes flawlessly as well as poetically, like Chopin intended.  Just listen to the Opus 25 Number 2 and you can hear exactly what I'm talking about.  For incredible technique just listen to the Revolutionary etude, one which even the best pianists have trouble with due to the unusual virtuoso demands required by the left hand.  Not much more can be said that hasn't already been said by others in praise of this recording.  All I can say now is that if you don't already own this, get it ASAP.  You definitely will not regret it.
0684867621|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this book. It's well written, and gets exciting towards the end, but Stephen King takes a long time to get there and being lost in the woods for over a week is inevitably rather repetitive. The plot is negligible.
B000003EUL|5.0|It's a sad fact that Sviatoslov Richter didn't care more about his recorded legacy.  What he left are simply incomparable interpretations of pieces from a wide array of composers, but sadly the sound quality in most of the recordings isn't really up to par with the recordings of other pianists of the same era.  Luckily, we were left with a few gems that have good sound quality and are amazing interpretations.  This disc is one of them.  To choose a highlight is easy, it's clearly the Appassionata, a piece that Richter believed must be played at the end of any recital if it is to be played at all; if not, all pieces that came afterwards would seem weak and diminished in quality.  I happen to disagree with this statement except in Richter's case, who is really the only pianist on record to play the Appassionata well.  In fact, it is my opinion that Richter was the best interpreter of Beethoven this century.  If only he recorded a complete cycle, what a prize it would be.  The Brahms though, is not one to be outdone.  The orchestra and the pianist have a relationship and understanding of the piece unlike any other.  They really do make the Brahm's concerto sound new, invigorated and full of life.  This disc is an essential for the quality of performance and the price tag makes it a bargain.  If you're looking for amazing pianism, look no further, because you've found it.
0385486804|5.0|Many people may write off the subject of this book, Christopher McCandless, as a crazy, ill-equipped dreamer who got what he deserved, but I think that the kid had a lot of bravery to do what he did---and do it all alone. He followed his dreams which ultimately he paid a price for. He was young, naive and alone in the wilderness, but it was also his choice and his fate. Jon Krakauer did a tremendous job in trying to get inside McCandless' head and show us how and why he wanted to explore nature on his own. Krakauer manages to make his subject accessible and sympathetic, even though in real life it seems he had no use for human interaction. It's an excellent, tragic story.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park's 'Hybrid Theory' is just sheer class. Way better than Bizkit' starfish album. Best songs on the album are Crawlin, Pushin Me Away, the masterpiece Cure for the Itch and the magnificent debut One Step Closer. Cant wait for them to release their second album. ROCK ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0385505833|5.0|John Grisham's latest book, &quot;Skipping Christmas,&quot; is an excellent look at how one couple decides to just miss out on Christmas and the holidays, while eliminating all of the chaos and extreme spending that naturally goes along with it.  Being a high-school student, I was forced to choose a book to read; one of which I would have to write a research paper on. I chose this book, because I thought it would be an excellent read, just in time for the holidays.  I must say, I do believe I made a smart choice.<br />  Skipping Christmas flows very nicely, and is hard to put down.  Every chapter seems to have a new and exciting, sometimes comic adventure that Luther and Nora Krank must face.  This book is very relaxing, and the characters are very descriptive, thus they are easily recognized, and visualized.  They interact very well in real-life type situations.<br />  I recommend this book to everyone, as it is a nice, fairly quick read that will readily get you into the spirit of the holidays.  Grisham teaches the reader that our society is losing touch with the important things in life, such as social interaction, and that the material possessions are over-powering whats important.  Being a high school student that rarely reads, I must say that I really did enjoy this book, and would not have any second thoughts reading another by John Grisham.
B000000OTY|5.0|&quot;Secret World&quot; is the second of two live albums released by Gabriel, and by far the better of the two.  The first, &quot;Plays Live,&quot; was released twelve years earlier, and &quot;Secret World&quot; reveals an artist who had made tremendous strides in the meantime.<br />Truly great live albums should offer versions of the songs on them that are either substantially altered and/or substantially improved from the originals.  For the most part, that's what Gabriel includes here.  He was backed on his 1993 by a crack group of world musicians, some of them who participated in his &quot;Us&quot; studio album.  As such, it is the best meld of rock and roll with world music since Paul Simon's &quot;Graceland.&quot;  &quot;Us&quot; is represented by seven of the double album's fifteen tracks and nearly all of the songs top the six minute mark.  In fact, if there is a drawback to this album, it's that &quot;Solsbury Hill&quot; is the only one pre-&quot;So&quot; (1986) song to make the playlist.  True, Gabriel most likely did not want to repeat himself extensively from &quot;Plays Live,&quot; but this record is so good, it leaves you begging to hear the versions of his earlier material as he played them on this tour.<br />But that's a minor quibble.  This is a fantastic live album that also, unfortunately, represents the only rock album Gabriel has released in the last decade.  Here's hoping we haven't heard the last of him.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|It is rare that I walk out of a movie, or worse, stop a movie on DVD before its completion.  I was ready to chuck this movie out the window after about 10 minutes into it.  It came across like a really bad SNL skit and just got more annoying as time wore on.  After 20 minutes, I threw in the towel.<br />Yikes! What the hell was this piece of ... anyway? The weekly countdown of old pop tunes?<br />The story was incomprehensible, even if I could stand the ridiculous musical score.<br />Whatever it was, I would not recommend it to my worst enemy.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I was very pleased with this album from the very first time I listened to it.  As usual, Incubus has offered well performed songs with meaningful lyrics.  I agree with everyone else who says Aqueous Transmission is the best song on the album, even though I fell asleep during the one minute ensemble of crickets that trails at the end of the track.  Morning View has not left my CD player since I put it in for the first time, and I'm sure it will hold it's place there for quite awhile.
0448060191|5.0|This was the first book I have ever read by Lousia. Through the years I have read ALL her other books but this one remains my favorite. If you read it you will understand why it is a classic!!!
0393312836|5.0|The book is excellent.  However, at the time that I am writing this, Amazon lists it as a hardcover.  I purchased the book.  It is NOT a hardcover book.  Click on the closeup view of the front-cover and you can see that it ever SAYS that it's a paperback!  You've been forewarned!
0553801481|5.0|I don't usually take the time to write reviews of the books I read, but I will definitely make an exception for Fool's Errand.  I did not want this book to end.

This and the rest of the Farseer books are a must read for everyone.<br />And if Robin Hobb reads this interview, keep up the amazing work.  You are truly a gifted writer.
B00003CXAA|5.0|The Godfather series was done brilliantly.  You really can't ask for any more from the I and II.  There is a little more to be desired of Part III - but it puts closure to the whole family and the business, so it is necessary.  The presence of Robert Duvall is missed as well.  It is interesting to see the kids of all the family (Sonny, Tom Hagen, etc).  <BR>   Anyway.  Part I is amazing.  Brando does a magnificant job as Vito Corleone.  He plays the part perfectly.  The other characters are able to play very well off of the prestige he brings to the set.  Part II is another incrediable movie.  You see how Vito Corleone (DiNero) rose to power in NYC in the 1920s and you see Michael (Pacino) further solidify the power of the family in Nevada.  I find the 1920's portion to be very fascinating because you also see characters such as Clemenza and Tessio and how they aided Vito and how he helped them.  It just shows you the depth of the characters that are in the triology.  <BR>   The Godfather DVD set is a must for anyone who appreciates movies.  The actors are amazing in them: Marlon Brando, James Caan, Al Pacino, Robert DiNero, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Andy Garcia, and Bridget Fonda.<BR>   The DVD set only enchances what Cappola has done.  The special features disc is very interesting as well.  It is great for those who love the movie.

B00003CXXS|3.0|Jurassic Park III further expands the JP universe. I have previously seen Jurassic Park and this does not quite live up to the original but it's enjoyable nonetheless. The visuals and script are good while the acting is decent as well. I recommend JPIII and I give it a 7 out of 10.
B000002LVB|5.0|Fabulous. Fun classic tunes. Just good old rock &amp; roll. A perfect exercise CD for my bike rides.
B00003CXZ1|2.0|I saw this movie on home DVD and I am glad to say I didn't waste 7.50 to see it in the theaters. First off it's lack of real plot is very frustrating and seems just to be an excuse for action sequences for Angelina Jolie. Many who see and enjoy this movie will be men drooling over Ms.Jolie as Lara Croft. This is somewhat of a waste of cinema. The picture quality was great and supplemental features were slightly above average. But I'm afraid for the intelligent avid film lover and moviegoer, this will be predictably disappointing.
B00003CXRM|5.0|First off let me say the movie is beautiful. The cinematography is great and the faded and brown overtones, which the whole film is shot in, give it a really rustic and homey feel. THe movie was casted perfectly, and every character coems to vibrant life. It really feels like your travelling down south in the early 30's or 40's. The crowning achievement on the film is the soundtrack. Aside from the &quot;man of constant sorrow&quot; song, which is heard several times throughtout the film, the backround music as well as the songs sung by the supporting cast are all excellent. They really immerse the audience into the movie.  The disc itself is good as far as dvd's go. THe picture is very crisp, and looks beautiul on any tv. the sound wasn't mind blowing but was very good. Extras are there but they are kinda boring unless you're really interested in the computer generated elements of the film. The best extra is the music video which is fun but not stupendous. <br /> I'd say the majority of people will at least kinda enjoy the movie, even if they dont love it. In the same vein as the hudsucker proxy and Raising Arizona, O brother is a whimsical journey through the back country. Fun, Fast paced, and full of good music, if nothing else you gotta rent the film.
0064471837|5.0|&quot;Sabriel&quot; earned it's place on my bookshelf long ago. It's a book I reread over and over at least once a year. The world Garth Nix creates is extremely original. Hardly ever does one read about how in the same plain of existance there is a medival side and a more modern side. &quot;Sabriel&quot; is about an eighteen year old student by the name of Sabriel whose father is the Abhorsen (binder of the dead, like a necromancer in reverse). When he sends something from Death to give her his Abhorsen instruments, she knows something is wrong. She braves the Old Kingdom, where the dead freely roam and one of the Greater Dead: Kerrigor. The problem is she knows almost nothing about the Old Kingdom, having lived on the other side of the wall seperating the two kingdoms from each other. On her journey to save her father she meet a cat Moggot, who is not what he seems, and a young man who calls himself Touchstone. Well, is that enough to convince you to read it?
6305546789|4.0|John Carpenter's first true hit was Halloween.  This spooky movie is about Michael Myers, who escaped a mental institute 15 years after murdering his older sister.  He begins to stalk and slowly pick of anyone who gets in his revenge seeking way.  Jamie Lee Curtis started her scream queenish ways here as a nerdy teen haunted by a strange figure.  The truly amazing thing about this whole movie is how cheap it was.  An independent film, this horror classic was shot for far far less than 1 million dollars. Although there are some noticeable mishaps.  (Mountains and palm trees in Illinois?  Does the inside of the house look like the outside?)  The thing that is spooky isn't what you see like the newer slasher movies, it is what you don't see.  Still an eerie film to watch.
0385505833|5.0|John Grisham, the creator of straight-shooting legal thrillers, is carrying on the thrilling work of Ayn Rand, and he has outdone the master of &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; and &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; by taking the standard sentimental Christmas  redemption story and turning it on its head in &quot;Skipping Christmas.&quot;<br />Within its 177 slim, narrow-margined pages is a feel-good story about the residents of an upper-class neighborhood infused with themes of sexuality, racism and scathing criticisms of Christianity and Soviet collectivism.<br />It's Thanksgiving, and Nora and Luther Krank have sent off their daughter, Blair, to help Peruvian Indians for a year as part of a Peace Corp mission. After floundering amid the incoming tide of Christmas commercialism at the grocery store, Luther conceives the idea of avoiding the holidays by going on a 10-day cruise, beginning on Christmas Day.<br />Astute readers may wonder why they didn't simply avoid the holidays by leaving 10 days before Christmas.  But Grisham here is playing on our expectations. He knows, as does the reader, that the Christmas redemption story demands that the Kranks undergo a revival of the Christmas spirit. Having them take off 10 days before would make that impossible. That would be logical. That would make sense. But human beings are not logical, Grisham is saying. We're animals, creatures of flesh and desire, and values such anything as friendship, love and altruism are false. Ayn Rand would have considered Nora and Luther Krank as heroes.<br />So Luther arranges the cruise and buys time at a tanning salon. He convinces his wife to go cold turkey on Christmas. No cards, no gifts, no carols, no tree, no lights, no plastic Frosty statue on the roof. What follows is a series of encounters with neighbors and co-workers, and a parade of symbolically charged figures representing Capitalism enslaved into serving religion. With each encounter, through the phrase, &quot;So, I hear you're not (insert name of Christmas-related activity) this year,&quot; the Kranks are pressured into renouncing their Randian beliefs.<br />The mental torture must be immense. When asked, &quot;So, Nora, no Christmas Eve bash this year?&quot; Nora thinks, &quot;you crude little snot.&quot; With an ability to peer behind such simple facades, Grisham sees something more sinister behind such innocent comments.<br />Meanwhile, Luther is importuned by Boy Scouts selling overpriced Christmas trees, the police selling calendars, and firefighters selling fruitcakes, all to serve various causes. To each, Luther &quot;forgets&quot; his promise to his wife and rejects their overtures. Instead, he promises each that he'll give them money later. We can bet that Luther will also &quot;forget&quot; these promises.<br />But Nora is not happy. Despite being the wife of a proto-Randian hero, Nora is still and woman and thus doomed to succumb to societal pressures. When their daughter calls the night before Christmas from Miami to say she'll be there for Christmas with her fianc&eacute;, Nora gives in. She will reaffirm middle-class values and rebuild the facade that they spent the book trying to tear down. They will have Christmas with all the trappings, and she turns on Luther like an avenging angel. She had endured his stoicism and his belief systems long enough. She has been critical of Luther throughout the book, but this tirade outdoes them all, and climaxes with an echo of the sexual confusion that permeates the whole book:<br />&quot;This was your stupid idea. Well today, you're an idiot. We're having the party, Mr. Beach Bum, and we're putting up a tree, with lights and decorations, and you're going to get your little brown butt up on the roof and do Frosty.&quot;<br />Cowed by his wife's anger, Luther rushes about and gathers the fixings for the party, but not before noticing one thing:<br />&quot;Don't Peruvians have dark skin?&quot; he asked.<br />Nora froze for a second. They stared ateach other, then both looked away.<br />&quot;I guess it doesn't matter now,&quot; she said.<br />&quot;She's not really getting married, is she?&quot; Luther said, in disbelief.<br />But they must put their racism aside. They must get the party together, and what follows is a series of comic scenes reminiscent of the Chevy Chase &quot;National Lampoon&quot; movies: Luther buys a tree from the Scouts, who, being of high moral character, shafts him on the price. He borrows a decorated tree from a neighbor and gets the police called on him. Luther tries to &quot;do Frosty&quot; and slides off the roof, and is saved from destruction only by a stray rope around his ankle. Then, when he confesses the real reason to his neighbors, they agree to help, solely because they love Blair, &quot;who was like a daughter to them all.&quot;<br />And that's not all from the joy-master. The Kranks' fears about a dark-skinned Peruvian is abated. It turns out that he is a doctor capable of speaking English who was educated in London and whiter than Luther's tan. Grisham had set up the tanning-bed sequence with a double purpose, and he sets off the charge that results in an explosion of hearty laughter from the reader.<br />After giving away the trip to a neighbor he doesn't like whose wife has breast cancer and will die, Luther feels blessed. Despite being boring and selfish and a racist and having no friends whatsoever, Luther gets pulled out of a jam, not because of who he is, but because he's related to someone people love. Luther has come to realize that he can be a true Randian hero, knowing that he won't have to suffer the consequences because of his powerful position within the company, and because his neighbors are in the thrall of his daughter. He has no regrets for what he's done nor regrets for his beliefs. Although temporarily defeated, Luther reflects optimistically on the future, thus setting the stage for &quot;Skipping Christmas 2,&quot; in which Grisham will expound further on the merits of Objectivism. But with its brevity, its wit, and its deep undercurrents, &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; is a brilliant tour de force that will continue to inspire debate and deep furrowed thinking.ch other, then both looked away.<br />&quot;I guess it doesn't matter now,&quot; she said.<br />&quot;She's not really getting married, is she?&quot; Luther said, in disbelief.<br />But they must put their racism aside.

B00001U0DP|5.0|With Life as Beautiful Roberto Benigni vaults himself from the ranks of good funny man to great all around actor.  His wonderful use of physical and situational humor are astonishing.  Life is Beautiful is a delightful film about a Jewish man who chases his love through a series of happenstances.  The story then takes a dramatic turn as the Nazi's enter his city and he and his family are sent to a concentration camp.  This is where the film really makes itself memorable.  Benigni is unforgettable as he uses everything in his heart and his head to keep his son happy and alive, promising that all of the horror is just a game and if he can play it well enough he will win a tank.  The DVD isn't much of an extra benefit, but it does allow you to watch it in English or Italian.  Please, please watch it in Italian.  Hearing the emotions of the actors makes it worth the effort.
630179513X|5.0|This is my least favorite Back to the Future movie. I thought that they could have picked another time period because the old west just seems a little boring. The special effects were really good though. My favorite bttf movie is the first one then the second and finaly finishing in last the third one. My favorite part of the movie is when the push the DeLoran with the train trying to get it to go 88mph. Otherwise the movie was pretty boring.
B00005221M|3.0|This is one of the only movies that appears completely different in the two formats. The DVD version has a few scenes apparently added at random throughout the movie which add nothing significant to the story and, indeed, do not even appear to be as finished (i.e. no background score or seeming direction) as the rest of the film. These frames have seemingly been entered only to fill time missing from the mysterious deletion of many other and better scenes. The only one of these additions possibly worth keeping is the final soliloquy at the very end by &quot;the last of the Mohicans&quot;. On the other hand the VHS film flows together seamlessly, telling a complete story with a polished finish. Every scene is properly imbued with appropriate music, including the haunting melody performed by the Celtic band, Clannad, which was cut from the DVD version. That is why this rating is only average: the VHS version is an exceptional five stars; the DVD version is an unimpressive two stars. Ideally both versions would be available as options on a DVD. As it is the DVD cinema is merely a superficial and generic &quot;frontier flick&quot; while the VHS movie is a deeply compelling romance.
630151940X|4.0|I have been using the library copy of this video and it is excellent.  The problem I have is that there is constant reference to the written materials that go with it.  The library didn't have them and the copy I have coming from another site doesn't either.  It would certainly be easier to do the playing with the written music.<br />The video has very clear explanations and practice guidelines.
B00005R87Q|2.0|If you are into Asian hot rods (lots of new tricked out Mitsubishis and Hondas) this is the movie for you. However, if you are expecting to see tight old school cars...there are TWO in this whole film. Since I am orignally from Southern California, I could relate to the teen scene and street racing in industrial areas that are depicted in this movie.  My friends here in Oakland (Northern California) were very disappointed with this film because they expected to see some nice old school cars. The acting leaves a lot to be desired, and the script is so predictable that I laughed out loud at times.
B0000073NC|4.0|Okay, so &quot;Ulrich Roth&quot; doesn't roll off the tongue as easily as &quot;Eric Clapton&quot; or &quot;Eddie Van Halen&quot;...but don't let that detract you from picking up a copy of what may well be the prototype &quot;air guitar&quot; metal album! The Scorpions may have arguably reached thier creative peak on what was only thier second effort. Although released in 1974, &quot;Fly To The Rainbow&quot; dates very well, particularly on some of the dynamic, well-arranged epic-length pieces, which would almost sound at home on a Queensrhyche or Dream Theater album. That being said, you also have &quot;Speedy's Coming&quot;, one of the best side 1 / cut 1's of all time, (right up there with &quot;Baba O'Reilly&quot; or &quot;All The Way From Memphis&quot;) which I'm sure has inspired some &quot;Tom Cruise dancing on Mom and Dad's sofa&quot;  moments for more than one of us! Ulrich Roth's expressive and powerfully sonic lead playing should appeal to fans of Gary Moore, with whom I see some stylistic similarities. One of the rare metal albums that works for both &quot;headphone&quot;  AND  &quot; Hey...let's share this with the neighbors!&quot; moods.
0688170528|5.0|I was forced to read a fictional novel at school and this book was recommeded to me by a couple of librarians. I honestly never read and I can say that this wasn't a boring book at all. Jodi Picoult's novel is truly page-turning. You don't want to let go of the book because it is written in chapters of &quot;Now&quot; and &quot;Then&quot;. You want to find out what happened in the past and what will happen in the future. The main characters are about two children destined for a life with each other. Their innocent friendship blossoms into a lustful love. Everything they have together and could have had together ends with a single gunshot. Jodi Picoult focuses on family, relationships, and the balance of love by examining each character's struggle with guilt and sorrow. This novel is well paced and easy to read. Jodi Picoult's novel is in such detail. It makes you picture everything in your head. The Pact is a great book for young adults, especially teenagers. I was able to relate to the story better because I am a teenager myself. I'll probably read more of her novels. I highly recommend The Pact to others out there.
0345440757|5.0|This is a great book. She takes all the major baby-raising philosophies: Ezzo vs. Sears, Ferber vs. Sears, Breast v. Bottle...and compiles it into one useful volume. This lady seems to know a *lot* about babies...I can't wait for the &quot;toddler&quot; edition.

B00005LOUP|3.0|Thought the film was a right laugh. Just one thing: Why is it the Theatrical trailer on the disc is a lot richer in colour and sharper than the actual film? It appears as though the black level has been raised making the transfer appear foggy. I can only assume this was an error made during transfer.<br />Still... great film, great sound. Shame about the image.
0792151712|2.0|Director/writer Cameron manages to take one of the most horrific events in our history and turn it into an insipid &quot;love&quot; story that has more holes than swiss cheese.<BR>First of all, there was so much actual intrigue on this ship that there was no need to create some totally bogus romance in the first place, he should have just concentrated on what actually happened.<BR>Secondly, the story has no basis in reality as the 2 lovers shack up after only a few days. This is in 1912 and I'm sorry but that sort of thing just did not happen. <BR>Third, the lovers spend something like 45 minutes battling the rising water inside the ship, but act as if they've been in the hot tub. In reality, the ice cold water would have nearly killed them at this point, but this utterly ridiculous story ignores that minor little detail.<BR>Fourth, the story also ignores major details about other ships in the area ignoring the Titanic calls for help.<BR>The special effects were great, and the one scene of the lovers parting in the ocean after Leonardo has (thankfully) frozen to death was very genuine indeed. The sad part is that you had to sit thru 2 and one half hours of some of the worst movie making I've ever seen just to get to those 45 seconds of reality.<BR>To some it up, what happend on the Titanic was a dissaster, but it pales when compared to this ridiculous movie that goes out of the way to inject a 100% fictional and silly story into a tragic real event. <BR>The special effects are good, but they would have been much better if they had been based in reality.<BR>I can't for one moment imagine why the academy felt compeled to honor this egomania-show when so many other movies (such as Contact with Jodie Foster) were FAR superior in every way.<BR>If you're looking for a GOOD movie about the Titanic, order the version starring Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck.
B00005J6UP|5.0|I have loved this movie the first time I saw it on television I think maybe on HBO. I can only imagine how fun this would be watching it for the first time in the theater, must have been incredable for those who got the chance to. The movie is great the film is by the amazing Richard Donner. The story and every thing is done by the amazing Steven Spielberg who has a way with children and looking through the eyes of the adventure. The screen play is written by Chris Columbus! I mean what more can you ask for with those great men in Hollywood? How about an amazing cast just staring out you have the youngsters like Corey Feldmen who plays the loud mouth &quot;Mouth,&quot; Sean Astin as the kid who leads them on the journey to save their home town, Josh Brolin who plays the older brother and helps keep them out of trouble and other noticable faces. Not only was this movie full of comedy but it leads to a spectacular adventure we can only dream about as kids. With spectacular senery, and great special effects.<br />The DVD is amazing buy, the commentary by the entire cast is worth it to buy from but more on that later. The graphic's of the DVD is outstanding. It leads you through a cave like senery like in the movie with voice over's from the cast. The full length Cindy Lauper video that aired on MTV and was a number one hit &quot;The Goonie's Are Good Enough.&quot; Some cut scene's with the octopus scene, and a scene that was cut out where they are in a 7/11 type store and so on. And a short but sweet Making of the Movie with talk from Richard Donner, some of the cast, and a young Steven himself.<br />As for the commentary that alone is worth the buy. Everyone showed up. However, Sean Astin for reason's unknown walked out in the middle of the commentary and Richard Donner can't remember half of what had happened during the commentary of his own movie. However, a lot of it was saved by Corey Feldman and  and Martha P. You'll hear interesting tid bits like maybe the hat from Indiana Jones was taken for the movie from the last Steven picture at the time :), The Jackson's hung out around the set, funny and memerable moments from the rest of the cast. It's truly amazing and I have fun watching it over and over. Even though they seem to be stepping over each other a lot it's just really fun to hear what happened during the making it.<br />It's great for children maybe over 13 and great for adults to relive the adventure!
B00005RHGK|2.0|After seeing the really suspenseful trailer and reading some very good critics of this horror flick, I couldn't wait to see it. It seemed as if this one would be different from your usual slasher stuff, I really expected to see a piece of psychological horror. But it's not. I was so dissapointed when I left the cinema. Though not very original (it reminded me very often of \\"Duell\\" and \\"Joyride\\"), the movie began quite promising, there are some witty dialogues, and you get to know the two protagonists better than it's usual for scary movies, Gina Phillips's and Justin Long's acting was also good. But that's only the first half of the trip. After some great (really great!) psychological shock moments, you get to see the villain and after seeing him it all gets very ridiculous, it seemed to me as if I'm seeing a really bad unaired episode of \\"Buffy-The Vampire Slayer\\". The atmosphere of silent terror gets destroyed by this cheap, cheap, cheap monster make up. It's the most ridiculous monster I've ever seen. It's not scary at all! And so is the ending, though it's surprisingly pessimistic, it's not satisfying at all. The movie just stops...the ending just doesn't feel right. I don't have anything against pessimistic and shocking endings, but hello! This ending just looked like they had not enough money to bring the movie to an end! <BR>Though all in all disappointing, this movie is worth a watch (rent it first), the first half is one of the finest in modern teen horror history. This one could have been so much better, why do they always have to show the monster?<BR.....
0783225857|5.0|I loved this DVD and movie in general. I loved the book when they made us read it about in Middle School. Since it's been ages since I've seen or read either I needed to get this video and I recieved it as a wonderful gift for Christmas. Though, it took me a while to watch it. When I did watch it however, it really does make you think back to those times. And some things I didn't even catch when I was younger that I do as an adult. The story is told by a grown up Scout who was rather a Tom Boy. Her and her brother growing up with their father who's a lawyer. The story intellengently touches on perhapes three stories in one. One story is of the family in general, the second one is the story of the kids wanting to know about their neighbor Boo Bradley. The third and most thought provoking and sometimes hard to watch because of it being so dramatic is where the father defends a black man who is accused of raping a white woman. That scene in general was outstanding. It's easy to see that Gregory Peck won an academy award for best actor. The movie makes you want to read the book, which does give more detail. However, the great thing about this movie is not for the actor's but the fact that it really does follow the book.<br />As for the DVD it's self it was a pleasure to navigate around. Has a wonderful information on production notes. And the idea of an author (Harper Lee) loving a Screen Play is quite unknown so that just tells you how much this movie is loved. The only thing is that the sound was rather hard to hear, however I haven't been able to find a DVD or Video yet that had good sound with this movie. It's still worth the buy you won't be sorry, the picture is great for a black and white film and it's fun re-watching a child's adventure in the times of a depression. I recommend this movie for anyone who's old enough to understand this film, and I garentee after you watch the movie you'll want to read the book. I wanted to re-read the book after I saw the movie again :)
B00005JKES|5.0|Oh, boo-hoo-hoo...my Twin Peaks DVD set did not include the pilot episode. Wahhh! I am too stupid to read the insert card which present a detailed retelling of the events of the ill-famed but irresistably indulgent pilot episode. So I am here to complain to anyone who will listen and belittle a great production company that tried their darndest to secure the rights to the Pilot, but were unable to do so. Sniff, sniff...I am too stupid to know that a show's pilot episode is not intrinsically attached to the official first season, and thus I hearby accuse Artisan and everyone else who is selling this DVD of false advertising. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm about to sit down and watch one of the best series to ever see the light of day on network television: &quot;Hee-Haw&quot; Agent Dale Cooper has nothin' over them &quot;Hee Haw&quot; yokels!<br />In all seriousness, this is the best this fabulous show has ever looked or sounded and I am pleased as pie to own this damn fine DVD set.
B000002GB4|2.0|Crystal Ball, the title track off of Tommy Shaw's debut with Styx, is a classic. But the rest of the cd doesn't hold up to the test. Put Me On, is and interesting rocker, sung by JY. Tommy's other two songs, and Dennis three, are stale.<BR> Who would know,that this would be the superstar line, by listening to this cd? GRADE C-
B000009O8A|5.0|This movie among a few others is one of my favorite horror films. This movie is about revenge and I also believe it tackles an interesting subject-RAPE. Rape is a subject most often portrayed in a mild manner, however in this film it is portrayed in a very graphic nature. This is something that should not be taking place in the world- but it does.<BR>The movie may be offensive to some people because of the brutal and graphic rape sequences.<BR>Originally titled Day of the Woman, which fits the film quite well, is unequaled in my opinion by any other film in the genre.<BR>This is the most graphic and brutal portrayal of rape EVER brought to the screen.<BR>This film is quite good and I highly recommend it to anyone who thinks they can stomach it!!! This film is not for the squeamish.<BR>See it at your own risk!!!<BR>NOTE: This film was originally released with an X rating because of the graphic rape sequences!!!<BR>One must be open-minded when viewing this film. Let's keep in mind that this is ONLY a movie!!! However, it touches base with an important subject- rape. This portrays rape realistically(very violently) and in actuality it is that way. It is mean and hateful and one of the many bad things that take place in the world. So to portray it mildly would be incorrect!!<BR>I have never seen a more violent and vile movie, but I give credit where it is due- they got their point across!!!<BR>After watching this movie, you will come to know RAPE(as wrong as it is) and you will witness it first hand.<BR>Finally, you will never be the same again!! No one should ever have to deal with the pain of rape...but to disregard this movie as garbage is quite wrong!<BR>My advice is to view this movie with an open mind!!!!!<BR>In doing so, you will see this movie for what it is- ART!!!<BR>This movie is a work of art and the message is that rape is a terrible part of our society, but yet it is a part of our society and this movie helps us to understand that rape does happpen and most importantly, that it SHOULDN'T!!!!!
B00005R87Q|5.0|This movie is great, story just keeps flowing. Good cars *good for not V8's*, good drag scenes, and a sweet charger to top it off at the end. I was impressed with the sound, the DTS mixing is one of the best i have heard. I recommend this for sure, even if you dont like cars !!
B000002NHN|5.0|I, being a person who listens to hard rock and metal normally wouldn't listen to softer music. But Loreena McKennitt is a different story. Her voice is extremely beautiful. The first song I heard done by her was the Mummers Dance. But now my favorite song is &quot;Dante's Prayer&quot; a VERY beautiful song. The more I hear the CD the more I enjoy it. I HIGHLY reccomend this CD to any music lover. I'm positive they would enjoy it.
B000006YTN|5.0|TONS OF SOBS by Free was the group's debut, originally released in the U.S. by A&amp;M records (SP 4198) in 1969.  This ensemble's trademark clean and economical sound, the rhythm and counter-rhythms among the vocals, bass, lead guitar and drums and a strong selection of original blues-based tunes, make this an enjoyable listening experience for all.  &quot;Sweet Tooth,&quot; &quot;Wild Indian Woman&quot; and &quot;The Hunter&quot; (which remains part of Paul Rodgers' in-concert setlist to this day) are standout cuts, but the material fits together well throughout.
B00000IQC8|3.0|I don't normally post anonymously, but I really think that &quot;Clerks&quot; was not a very good movie, and I'd like to express my opinion without being savaged by hardcore fans. The film had a number of fun and interesting characters (Jay and Silent Bob were first introduced here), and some very funnily-written scenes, but the timing was way off in most of the dialog.<br />After almost every line in the film, there was a pause, as if to give us time to listen for a moment to the hiss of student film sound equipment and wait for the other actor to deliver his or her line without the least semblance of spontaneity. The bad lighting and grainy visual quality of the film don't do much for me, either. If, like many, you were completely taken up in the content of what was being said, you may have been able to overlook it, but if you look for the pauses, you will see them, then you will begin to predict them before they happen, then you will dread their inevitable appearance. I started noticing them early on, and it was all down hill from there. Timing is vitally important to me in a comedy.<br />I would love to see what this film would be like if Kevin Smith were to remake it today with better equipment, more experienced actors, and a better sense of pace and timing. I see the things that people like in this film, but I just wasn't able to get into the performances, for the reasons I describe above. Fix those problems, and this film would be worth the 5 stars it often gets.<br />As to the &quot;collector's edition&quot; aspect of the DVD, I'd rate this one better than most (and I'm rarely even slightly impressed by special features on DVDs). Kevin Smith gives a lot of good commentary, and the alternate ending was interesting to watch.
B00005RJ1U|5.0|Any body that didnt like this movie didn't really see it or they're brain dead. point blank.
B000001DWG|5.0|This is truly one of the most beautiful and sad albums to come out of Seattle. I'll echo what almost all other reviewers have said: a cloud raining &quot;what if?&quot; hangs over this whole album.<br />Andrew Wood...so brilliant, so tortured, so glam. His voice has a bit of that Led Zepplin/'80s metal tinge to it, but Andy's lyrics are timeless, especially if you know anyone who has stuggled with drug or alcohol abuse. Even if you're lucky enough not to, you'll still find an aching beauty in each of these epic songs.<br />I'm not sure if this album really qualifies as &quot;grunge,&quot; since Mother Love Bone really predated the commercial explosion that happened in the early '90s (Andy died in March of 1990, and most of these songs were written in '88 and '89). MLB influenced the genre, definitely, but isn't always as angry and thrashing as much the music recorded by Pearl Jam and Nirvana. Mother Love Bone is much more emotive and lovely.<br />After listening to this Mother Love Bone CD and then Pearl Jam's &quot;Ten,&quot; I realized that I actually like Andy Wood's voice better much more than Eddie Vedder's--a surprise for me as a Pearl Jam fan. All you have to do is compare the original version of &quot;Chloe Dancer/Crown of Thorns&quot; with the Pearl Jam cover (an Mp3 I downloaded). Eddie Vedder simply can't bring the magic to that song that Andy could...Eddie's voice sounds bleating and overdone instead of Andy's simple ease.<br />Stone Gossard's power riffs give me tingles, especially on &quot;Stardog Champion.&quot; But it's the lyrics that almost make me cry:<br />You ever heard the story,<br />of Mister Faded Glory?<br />Say he who rides the pony must someday fall,<br />I been talking to my altar<br />It says life is what you make it,<br />And if you make it death well rest your soul.<br />Away, away, away.
0783113943|4.0|WOW.... That's all I can say. Go for it guys. You may well react the same way.  But if you really want to see how good of an actress Angelina Jolie could be, watch &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot;.
B00005RYKU|5.0|Leelee is once again great!  I won't sum up the plot since others have, but I really enjoyed this film.  The sister-brother interaction is actually quite funny, even in this suspense film.  Great movie to see!
0790737973|2.0|When I read the book by Michael Crichton, I somehow felt that the story of the spaceship from the future and the story of the sphere were two different incomplete stories roughly merged to create a book. The story of the spaceship from the future was intriguing, but rapidly deflated and served only to lead into the second story about the sphere.  The basic concept underlying the sphere was borrowed from an earlier movie &quot;The Forbidden Planet&quot; made over 40 years earlier.  In the 1956 classic, the monster of Dr. Morbius' subconscious became murderously real through the use of alien technolgy.  In &quot;The Sphere&quot;, the giant squid and other menaces from the characters' subconsciouses became reality via the alien sphere.<br />After having read the book, I looked forward to seeing the movie, expecting a good performance by Dustin Hoffman and Samuel Jackson. But when I noticed the promotional poster only showed the faces of the cast rather than the sphere itself or the spaceship, I began to fear the worst.  The poor choice of Sharon Stone for her role was evident immediately, and was not overshaddowed by the disappointing limp acting of the others.<br />You must read the book and view the movie or perhaps just read the book and forget the movie, for the movie alone leaves out essential and vital details to understanding the concept of the sphere.  Or better yet, view &quot;The Forbidden Planet&quot; instead!

B0000089A1|4.0|Ray has always managed to turn personal disaster into potent musical poetry. Having mined his own nervous break down and jealousy of brother Dave for classic material, he spun his bitterness at the music industry, the experience of endless touring and his close encounter with a transsexual into music gold.<br />The playing is sharp throughout but the demo version of Apeman demonstrated that some of the best material never made it to LP. Dave's guitar solo gives the song bite and it's actually superior to the album version. Originally released on a single in Europe, this version of Apeman hasn't been heard in the US before.<br />Dave contributes two strong tracks with Strangers every bit the equal of Ray's best material on the album. After Lola the band's albums would show a sharp decline in quality. Both Everybody's in Showbiz and Muswell Hillbillies have their moments equal to the best the band ever produced, but both are inconsistent.<br />The mastering is an improvement here over some of the other Castle reissues (particularly Something Else) but not quite as good as the Japanese import released in 2000.
B000056WTH|5.0|This is easily one of the greatest action movies ever made (and, personally, I think it's one of the greatest movies ever made, period.)  It is also one of those rare movies that defines its genre, and yet, at the same time, transcends its genre.  Actually, you have three different genres being represented in this film that, in the years since, have become intertwined as the norm for this type of movie because of &quot;The Road Warrior&quot;'s influence.  You have the much-copied post-apocalyptic wasteland, populated by barbaric savages and helpless victims; you have the classic western and the classic western's &quot;reluctant hero,&quot; represented here by Mad Max, the drifting loner, scarred by his past, who only comes to the aid of others when it serves him; and, of course, you have the spectacular car chases, amazing stunts and crashes and huge explosions of the modern action movie.  &quot;The Road Warrior&quot; brought all three of these elements together, and you can still see them in movies today, such as the much-inferior &quot;Waterworld&quot; and &quot;The Postman&quot; (man, Costner must've liked this movie too--you'd think he'd get it right eventually.)  <BR>And, as an action movie, &quot;The Road Warrior&quot; has yet to be topped.  All of the stunts, chases, crashes, explosions you see on the screen are 100% real.  No computer enhancement, no technical junk -- when you see a guy drive into a car on a motorcycle and he flies about 75 feet through the air, it's real.  And when I say this movie transcends its genre, I'm talking about the style in which it's directed.  All of the action becomes almost operatic because of the expert direction and musical score.  It comes across as a beautiful-looking action movie, in spite of all the violence and carnage.<BR>  I wouldn't hesitate to rate &quot;The Road Warrior&quot; as one of the best action movies of all time and Mel Gibson's Mad Max as one of the greatest (if not THE greatest) action &quot;hero&quot; incinema history.  If this movie were made today, the writers would probably have him cracking lame one-liners throughout the film, but, instead, Max hardly speaks at all (the strong, silent type that also goes with the western genre) -- his actions speak for him.  I wish Hollywood at least attempted to make action movies and action movie heroes like this these days (well, come to think of it, I guess they did attempt it with &quot;Waterworld,&quot; and that became one of the biggest money-losers in film history, so I guess the moral is:  Don't try to duplicate perfection.)
B00003CXAY|5.0|I hope amazon gets this DVD released. Some people consider Baraka to be in similar vein but Koy is very much the better film. <br />There is a website which is organising a campaign to have the film released on DVD. It describes the legal wrangles involved as there are now several studios claiming the rights, so no one studio is releasing it.
B00005OWIU|5.0|this cd is now my new favorite cd. i love the music -it captures all the emotions that were in the movie and in the books it is the only cd in this genre of music that i will listen to from beginning to end. my favorite is hedwigs theme, but i also like the chess game. i also liked the reoccuring themes, to me it was tying everything together. while you listen to it you can imagine in your head what happened in the movie. its an awesome cd, really great. go out and buy it!!
B00005OWEG|5.0|An epic anti-war statement, Apocalypse Now is quite possibly one of the best movies of all time.  Loosely based upon the novel Heart of Darkness, it is set within the Vietnam war, where Cap. Willard (Martin Sheen), a disenfranchised and tired soldier who drinks too much, is sent by his leaders deep into Cambodia to find a rogue Colonel who's gone insane (Marlon Brando).<BR>    The movie's heart and soul is not in its plot though, but its intense characters.  A scent-obsessed surfing commander who sees a battlefield as nothing more than gunfire next to open surf, a New Orleans sensitive fighter, and (of course) Colonel Kurtz.  The characters all show a little of the insanity that goes with war situations, and enter you into the battlefield.<BR>    The plot itself is reason to show the horrors of war.  Brutality is the name of war, and we're constantly suprised while viewing at how cruel humans can be.  Even the main character is no hero, but a constantly flawed man, operating from pure orders.  Kurtz is a genuine madman, whose blown mind allows him to both read poetry to himself aloud, and decapitate innocents to prove a point.<BR>    Albeit disturbing and most-graphic, Apocalypse Now is an essential movie for anyone to see.  It is truly a message of what humans under specific circumstances are capable of, and the effect war has on the psyche.<br />I firmly believe in preserving the director's original vision, and this is why I've chosen to review the Redux edition.
B000056K04|2.0|DMB fan here who hates this album. Lousy short 3 minute made-for-radio songs. Angel is the most sickening song I've heard from this band. Never thought i'd use the word sickening to decribe a DMB song. One or two exceptions of course: Everyday and Dreams of Our Fathers have merits. That's it- nothing too articulate here. Just a quick review. Hope their next one is better!
B000003TAL|5.0|\\"You're it. No, you're it. Hey.  You're really it. You're it. No, I mean it. You're it. Say it. Don't spray it.\\"  Them's the first lyrics of this fine LP.  Hey, I'll tell you right now that I was digging hip hop in 1988 and didn't own this thing until later days.  I first heard it at a party (yeah, it was that kind of party) and purchased it on good old two sided casette tape.  I quickly lost the cover, never knew the names of the songs, and mis-understood most of the words.  But I'll tell you one thing:  It made me love rock and roll.  Now maybe if I'd owned the LP I would have sat in my room, stared at the candle on the cover (quite beautiful, no?), and contemplated all of the inner meanings.  Not me.  Over the years I have used this as the type of song to play when I'm wasted and want to drive my car 100 mph fast on the highway at 3 a.m. in the morning with the windows wide open, and this blowing out the tweeters on my rear speakers.  I once thought I saw Jesus 9:16 into the Trilogy.  Take it from me, it is particularly effective if you have lost a large sum of money playing craps.  I have bought most of their others c.d.'s and sometimes find Kim's voice grating (sic).  (Sorry Ms. Gordon).  But here she (and Thurston)'s voices become another instrument.  Everyone plays with confidence.  While the guitars weave in and out of the feeback and static and muckety muck, the drums just rock out.  I've always loved the drums.  Daydream Nation makes me think of Marquee Moon (the song itslef more than the other excellent New York Rawk Record itself).  Three questions for future reviewers:  Do you think that the band consciously used Marquee Moon as a model for the name?  How cool would it have been to have been friends with Mike Watt in 1988?  Do you think Lester Bangs would have dug these guys?<br />(note:  English is not my native language and I apologize for any grammatical errors that may have occurred.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I had heard mixed reviews on this &amp; the video store girl didn't like it, but me (I'm 46), loved it! I agree: you should be mature enough to understand movies &amp; life in general. One should realize the songs are not from 100 yrs ago, but from the 50s or later. So much energy! So much imagination! Almost too much energy in the beginning, but stay with it. It has 3 acts &amp; the final one will blow your mind. Terrific, terrific cast with Nicole especially great. If she doesn't win the Academy award, I can't Imagine, who will! Stunning from beginning to end! Took two yrs to film! If there's a better movie from '01, I'd love to see it!! Run, don't walk, to rent or buy this masterpiece.
B000059XYM|5.0|I have to admit, as sick as it sounds, violence in movies greatly amuses me. Which is how I got into the horror genre because to be horror films are so unrealistic and over the top I just have to laugh.<BR> This was the perfect solution. A scary movie that's meant to be funny. <BR>   OK some of the jokes are a little crude and juvenile. But the Wayans promise comedy not class. <BR>   And it takes real talent to pull of a project like this.<BR>So what if it ain't 'Citizen Kane'? <BR>  It's still a classic in it's own way.
B00005AFMT|5.0|An excellent piece of work!  It's hard to believe that this album was released over 20 years ago and yet it's as progressive and impressive today as it was in the 80's!  Inspiring!
B0000507PC|3.0|...I have a feeling that if The Cidar House Rules wasn't so out-and-out pro-abortion it wouldn't have gotten the positive attention it has.  Tobey Maguire wasn't particularly compelling in the lead role, and the Oscar-winning performance by Michael Caine was good, but not among his best.  The plot was emotionally manipulative in that the worst possible test case for abortion (incest) was used as the turning point for the protagonist's &quot;conversion,&quot; when in reality only a tiny fraction of unwanted pregnancies are due to rape or incest.  And any anti-abortion sentiments were given short shrift in the film.<br />When you add to these observations the rabid comments of some of the  pro-abortion reviewers of the film (the one below mine, for instance) and the remarks made by John Irving at the Oscars, thanking Planned Parenthood and NARAL, it makes one think that there's more to this than just a good film that happens to have abortion as one of its subjects.  What you have here is an average film being touted as a great one because it takes a politically correct stance (and a rather simplistic one, I might add) on a divisive issue.
0425180638|5.0|I have read most of P. Cornwell's novels and this series (Black Notice, The Last Precinct, ??) is the best so far.  I listened to this on audiotape (unabridged) and never wanted to leave my car.  I found myself going to fast food restaurants for lunch just so I could be in the car and listen to this book.  I don't agree with the many people who found this depressing or boring or disjointed.  I felt like I was there with Kay and Pete and Lucy, etc.  I felt like we really were able to see inside of Kay Scarpetta's head.  Sure she has a depressing job - how can being a medical examiner be happy?  And her lover was brutally murdered.  This is like life - sometimes it's depressing.  I cannot wait for the next book in this series!!
1558908358|1.0|The movie is interesting, but spoiled by poor presentation.<br />The DVD was non-anamorphic, which is very disappointing. Usefully a note could be in the specifications like: &quot;WARNING: THIS PRODUCT IS NOT UP TO THE STANDARDS FOR WHICH REASON YOU PURCHASED A DVD PLAYER. WE RECOMMEND YOU WAIT UNTIL SOMEBODY MAKES A REAL ONE UP&quot;.<br />Obviously I'm exaggerating, but next time I get one of these sub-discs I'll have to return it.<br />Releasing a movie like this one in NTSC non-anamorphic is very unsatisfactory. The number of lines of resolution approaches that of a VCR! Even with PAL, when the recording is not anamorphic, there are still too few lines for a good picture on a large TV.
B000002H33|5.0|When I feel like listening to Metallica, this is usually the album I grab.  I have all their CDs up to the black album, and this has got to be my favorite.  I really like all of their albums, but this stands out just a little to me.<br />A lot of people I know always wonder why I like Metallica, they think the music is only about beating on guitars and screaming.  Of course, they've never really listened to any of the songs, it's just their ignorance.  I think they would start to appreciate Metallica if they actually listened to how complex some of these songs are, the great development they have, and how they can instantly change moods.  There is so much good stuff in here.<br />These songs are really long though, compared to most of the 3 or four minute stuff out today, but they are never boring.  They don't just have a chorus and a couple of verses, there is a lot of development before they're over.  I won't give a play-by-play, other people have done that.  I will just say to get this album if you don't have it, I think you will like it.
0486211045|5.0|&quot;Constructive Anatomy&quot; is unique in that George presents the viewer a 'real world' application of the muscles, by telling you what each muscle does.  <br />I'd be wrong in saying this book is a one-stop source for learning to draw people.  Let's face it anatomy is tough and artists can use all the help they can get!  What this book offers that other's don't is different views and applications of perceiving the limbs, muscles, bones, joints, etc., of the body.  For the price it's listed out, ya can't go wrong!
B00004RFCM|5.0|I really enjoyed this DVD set. I am an avid Sex and the City Watcher.  I didn't start watching it until their 3rd Season, so I missed out on the beginning episodes.  I like seeing the characters in the beginning.  Seeing how they have changed from then to now. I bought the 2nd Season also.
6302293553|5.0|This movie is one of the funniest movies ever! The humor in the movies takes a minute to get sometimes, but it is still a great movie to sit down and laugh at. Whether it is the coconut horse sounds, or the knights who say &quot;NI&quot; this movie is great. If you need to laugh, or just want a movie that will take your mind off of the real world for awhile, this is the one!
0375431624|4.0|Luther's got it bad.  He's got the &quot;I-Hate-Christmas-Blues&quot; and has a brilliant idea on how to avoid the whole season.  But we all know what happens to the best-made plans and Luther's dream of ditching the holiday is shot to hell when his daughter calls from Peru.<br />John Grisham opened a new door for his readers when he wrote A Painted House.  Skipping Christmas shows us another side of Grisham -- the far side -- and like the cartoon, this side is delightfully funny.
6300248178|5.0|This is simply a superb sci-fiction movie. Directed at a cracking pace by John Mctiernan the film begins with a first rate screenplay. Arnold Schwarzenegger is the larger than life hero and absolutely in control. The character portrayed by him is a cool,icy commando respected by his team though mercenarylike. What holds absolute audience attention is the natural outdoor settings, no-nonsense special effects and the tense action. Dutch &amp; his group of loyal army buddies are out on a rescue mission in South America and out of the blue an evil alien who loves skinning its victims strikes terror in the dense jungles. Even the battle hardened team of tough guys are baffled at this almost invisible alien who simply kills &amp; disappears. A truly memorable film though not for the slightly squeamish. A must see Arnold special.
B0000027I6|5.0|This is the most significant album Roger has made since his split with the Pink Floyd. Technically and instrumentally it's an extremely complex album, with hundreds of overlayed sounds and several Floyd signature TV audio out-takes. It tackles the subjects closest to Roger Waters' heart, issues touched on in the Dark Side of the Moon, but revisited here in greater depth with more maturity: Money, politics, war and the frustrations and helpless feelings often evoked by living in the modern world. If Pink Floyd were still a ship steered by the emotional edge that Roger gave the band, this would be the product of the their labors. It's easy to listen to, and an album that's so full of everything a great album contains, that you'll find it hard to get fed up of this CD.
B00005RHGK|4.0|I did not watch this movie at the theathers, but some of my friends did and they hated it. I asked why and they had no explenation. But anyways when this DvD came out on release day I rushed and got me one and took it home. And before I started to open up the factory seal on it,,,, one of my buddies called me and told me to \\"STOP\\" and not open it becasue it would be the worste [price]spent on any DvD. He recommended me to rent it before I open my DvD. So me and my dumb self had to listen to him,... so I rushed over to my local BlockBuster and got me one and rushed home and watched it. <BR>All I have to say is WOW!!!! This movie was pretty creepy and I really enjoyed this flick. I think that majority of people why they did not like it because there are some things that can throw you off and ask certin questions. For Example: <BR>1). Where did this monster come from?<BR>2). Why did this monster kill people and for what reason??<BR>but I truly did understand this movie. infact its a keeper for a true horror movie collectors.<BR>I have to say please buy it and if you dont got the cash to own it.. please rent it and I can promise you you will enjoy this horror of an thriller movie!!! Jeepers ... creepers,,, where you get them peepers  (just remember this song)  :)  !!!!
6304466498|5.0|A spoof on star wars and other sci-fi movies, what else could you want? Mel Brooks is one of the funniest actors/directors in the buisness, all his movies are worth watching. This movie has a good story that keeps you laughing the whole way through. Whether it is the shwartz, or pizza the hutt, this movie is great. If you are a fan of Mel Brooks, or just want to laugh, buy this movie.
B00005R87Q|5.0|i am a 34 yr old woman and i just love the show fast and furious,it was interesting and i loved the cars and dominic he made the whole show with his bad boy image.the races was really good. i would suggest this movie to anyone. you wont be disappointed.
B000002WYT|5.0|I have yet to get tired of this CD and I have had it since it was released and can honestly say it is still my favorite. &quot;Two Step&quot; makes me dance around the living room on my tippy toes, &quot;#41&quot; makes me bluesy and seductive, &quot;Crash&quot; will make you look across the room at your SO and love them even more for just being in the same realm of you, &quot;So much to say&quot; and &quot;Two Much&quot; are the fun songs to sing-a-long ones on the CD. Overall a  MUST BUY and one that you will treasure for a while.
0525946284|5.0|This was so much fun.  Totally implausible, I think, but that's unimportant.  I loved the characters and the story kept me on the edge of my seat.  I kept mentally casting the movie.  Great opportunity for George Clooney to break out as a villain.  I think he'd be perfect as Dieter Franck. This is Follett's best since &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot;.
B0000062GK|5.0|I only just recently began listening to solo guitarists like Joe Satriani and Steve Vai.  After comparing the two, I have decided that I like Satriani's work better even though they are both about equal in skill.  &quot;Crystal Planet&quot; is definitely Satriani's best album.  It mixes incredible technical guitar work with memorable riffs and solos that will impress even the most shallow of music fans.  The song &quot;Crystal Planet&quot; is one of the most astounding guitar pieces I have ever heard, and songs like &quot;a train of angels&quot; and &quot;ceremony&quot; are equally amazing and could have done well on the radio.  If you like good guitar work with excellent variety and composition, then this album is a must buy
0141180870|4.0|&quot;The Beautiful and Damned&quot; vs. &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;-obviously the verdict reached by the general reader and critic gives the laurels to the latter.  But I don't think this book was meant for either, hence its low estimation in their minds.  It was meant for readers who, like the book's hero (or what we might nowadays call antihero), Anthony Patch, see clearly: the emptiness of all endeavors in life not involving beauty.  I was reminded in reading this work of Yeats' lines &quot;What portion can the artist have who has awakened from the common dream but dissipation and despair.&quot;<br />  The book is not even truly a novel to my mind but rather as Tolstoy said of his &quot;War and Peace&quot; -&quot;a great swath of life.&quot;  Only &quot;Anna Karenina,&quot; which parallels &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; in this<br />sense, did Tolstoy dub his &quot;novel.&quot;  This may be another way of saying that the book is what another reviewer denominates &quot;Naturalistic.&quot;  But, whatever it is, I much prefer its poetic lyricism to the arid artifice that constitutes &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; much as I infinitely prefer &quot;War and Peace&quot; to &quot;Anna Karenina.&quot;<br />  The flaws in the book (and the reason I gave it only 4 stars) arise when Fitzgerald veers from this three-dimensional writing style to the vapid and two-dimensional characterizations of many of Anthony's acquaintances: What is lacking is texture and background here.  Proust wrote about inane decadents as well, but did so in such a way that the reader gains perspective and insight into their condition.  This richness is sadly lacking in &quot;The Beautiful and Damned.&quot;<br />  But, aside from this somewhat technical flaw, the book's essential theme and philosophical import-that those who worship exclusively at the altar of Beauty must anticipate a high cost-make it one of the most important works of this century.  For beauty in all its earthly incarnations is quintessentially transient. This is nowhere made more clear than in Anthony's soliloquizing to Dot &quot;...you can't have anything at all.  Because desire just cheats you.  It's like a sunbeam skipping here and there around a room.  It stops and guilds some inconsequential object, and we poor fools try to grasp it-but when we do the sunbeam moves on to something else, and you've got the inconsequential part, but the glitter that made you want it is gone-&quot;<br />  Thus, the book is authentic tragedy, with a note of triumph.  I won't give away what other reviewers seem to find the controversial or ambivalent ending.  But I, for one, found the words of Paul coming to mind, &quot;I have fought the good fight.  I have kept the faith.&quot;ntially transient. This is nowhere made more clear than in Anthony's soliloquizing to Dot &quot;...you can't have anything at all.  Because desire just cheats you.

B000006OAM|5.0|This is one of those CD's you have to be in a particular mood for. I wasn't a die hard fan of hers until I actually purchased this CD and listened to some of the lyrics and hauntingly mellow music. Tracks 1 - 7 flowed just right together for me. I must say that &quot;Life is Sweet&quot; is such a telling song as well as &quot;Kind and Generous&quot;. I ido agree with what someone mentioned about it not being very positive but hey, sometime your just not in the mood for that. Although &quot;Kind and Generous&quot; and &quot;King of May&quot; wasn't to melancholy.<br />I have since bought the CD for others as well as let people burn my copy even recorded it on tape to listen to in my car what a find for me. :)
B00000K0DQ|5.0|Okay, must admit Penn and Sarandon aren't two of my favorite actors.  For that matter, I can't imagine someone like Tim Robbins creating high art and social commentary.  But this film has proven me wrong on all levels.  Not only is Robbins script and direction sterling, but both Penn and Sarandon are flawless in their portrayals or a true story.  Sharp, smart, and never once does this film pander.  Great filmmaking all around.
B00005BL2A|2.0|Sorry folks, this DM fan is with the nay-sayers on this album. Except for the vocals, it's weak by DM standards and lacks an essential element: music!<br />In my view, there seem to be three basic elements that make DM what it is (or was). <br />1. The vocals.<BR>2. The songwriting.<BR>3. The music.<br />We've always known who sings and who writes the songs, and with each new DM release, it becomes more apparent who was behind what came to be the classic DM sound. Take a listen to any song on this album, then pop on your copy of, say, Music for the Masses. Big difference?<br />There's no need to go through the songs individually; I've lost some respect for Gore with this one. The best songs on this album sound most like a rehash of Ultra's mellower tunes, and others lack DM's depth and sincerity. \\"I Feel Loved,\\" is a flimsy and genaric house-pop track; Madonna puts out edgier singles than this these days. It's weird to hear these '80s influencers who once carved their own path barely tagging along with today's mainstream.<br />Along with Wilder, I'd say the band also needed to work with a good producer. On Exciter, they seem to be working with a guy who's sitting in as producer and \\"oh by the way, could you fill in some music there?\\"- musician. <br />Gahan and Gore do a nice job with the singing as usual, but not any better than on previous records. People seem to be in a fit over these vocals since the songs don't offer much else; have they ever heard of the song \\"Clean?\\" <br />Oh well, cheers to these guys for persevering. It's still alright as Top 40 records go, and they've gotta make a living. They're in a good a position to make albums that will sell. I suppose the 80's fans just need to face the music...without Wilder, there isn't any.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|A truely fantastic movie. Full of drama, romance, & comedy. One you can watch again and again. A must for ballroom dancing fans.
B000001ESF|5.0|It's great having one to treasure with.
B00003CXCS|5.0|Whether you like or dislike this movie, that's up to you. Not everyone has the same taste. So, I'll just tell you what I like about this DVD version:<br />-The sound is awesome. They have enhanced it with the THX digitally mastered format.<br />-Disc1 has the movie, the DVD-ROM stuff and the audio commentary by Robert Wise. So as you play the movie, he tells you about certain scenes.<br />-Disc2 has everything a true fan would want. It contains documentaries, audio supplements, interviews, production stills, trailers, radio and TV sports and DVD-ROM games.<br />-The movie comes in widescreen format. On a big TV, this is no biggie. It's actually better because you are watching the movie as it was presented at the theater.<br />-The quality of the picture is ... well DVD quality. With that I mean, the very nice and sharp quality VHS lacks.<br />What I don't like?<br />Well, nothing. If I were to find something I don't like, it would be the option of having the widescreen and tv-screen versions included. I wonder if that would take three discs though. But I like it as it is offered.<br />Finally, I love the movie. I've watched it so many times, and I know I'll keep watching it forever. The only difference is that now I get to see it at such good quality and with all those behind-the-scenes extras I always wondered about.<br />:)
0385505833|5.0|I just finished this wonderful little book and enjoyed it tremendously! This is a parable about Luther and Nora Krank and their first Christmas without their daughter Blair (who has left to join the peace corps).<br />Nora is ready for the same old Christmas festivities - which they spent a small fortune on the previous year. Luther, an accountant, adds up the previous year's receipts and convinces his wife that since it is just the two of them that they should save their money and go on a cruise instead. They agree and forgo all of Christmas, no lights, no tree, no gifts, no parties, no hassles, no expenses. They become quite delighted with their plan to skip all the Christmas festivities and go away together on the cruise. They watch the days go by, go get tans in tanning booths, and skip gleefully through their days as their cruise vacation draws near.<br />Unfortunately, their neighbors and friends are shocked by their decision to go away and lay on the pressure. The neighbors turn on them, tease them, and mildly harrass them. Now, that all sounds awful, but what happens next will surprise and delight you. This book takes you through many laughs due to its satyrical nature as well as giving you quite a lump in your throat at the end. John Grisham has stretched his wings with this one and comes out on top! This is great fun to read, read it. You laugh like I did, you'll get choked up like I did. Get this book and enjoy it!
B00005NW02|5.0|Toxicity is easily one of the best releases of the year, in any genre. System of a down has taken heavy metal and interlaced it with melody and arabic influences to create an entirely new and different sound. It is heavy metal, so the faint hearted may find it a little hard to get past the sheer heaviness of the album. Daron and Serj's lyrics are at times very direct (&quot;Prison Song,&quot; &quot;Deer Dance,&quot; and definetly &quot;Bounce&quot;) and at other times quite mysterious (&quot;Toxicity,&quot; &quot;Chop Suey&quot;). Overall, a great album. They showed heaps of promise and their excellent but occasionally poor debut, and delivered on every sliver of it. Very highly recomended. High points on the album include &quot;Chop Suey!&quot;, &quot;Prison Song,&quot; &quot;Aerials&quot;, and &quot;Shimmy.&quot;
B00003CXTG|1.0|I am never one to trust the advice of critics. Although everybody trashed this movie for it's misplaced love story and excessive plot building, I had to see it for myself. I am sad to say that the critics were 100% right. I am a huge bruckheimer fan, and I think it was a disservice for him to make this movie. I know that Ben Affleck needed to go to rehab. It might have been because he was in this movie...
020530902X|5.0|I'm frustrated that this book is not a required read - no, the entire grammar text book - at my high school.  So many kids (myself included!) , even in the Advanced Placement English class, do not grasp many fundamentals Strunk puts across so tactfully in this book.  (I just used one of his most basic, &quot;Omit needless words,&quot; before submitting my review.)<br />I myself like the style the book is written in, since the style really makes me giggle once in awhile.  E.B. White's introduction is quite interesting, and really sums up the book quite nicely.  I highly recommend E.B. White's essays.<br />I hope more teachers will unleash this gem into junior high and high school classrooms around the country - student writing would be amazingly better, I have no doubt about it.
B000002VTE|5.0|&quot;There is a time with all passions when they are merely fatalities, when they drag their victim down with the weight of their folly - and a later, very much later time when they are wedded with the spirit, when they are 'spiritualized'.&quot;<BR>- Nietzsche, &quot;Twilight of the Idols&quot;.<br />A spiritualized passion is precisely what this record is about. Spiritualized, yet unbound, and carrying an overwhelming creative force. Hardly is it sensible to argue that every track speaks of this passion with equal eloquence; however, overall impact is undeniably potent. &quot;I Think I'm In Love&quot; is alone so brilliant it could redeem whatever insignificant (or even significant) flaws may afflict other tracks. &quot;Cop Shoot Cop&quot; is another highlight: resplendent with imagery, it is so emotional and vivid, one can almost &quot;see&quot; the music in all its splendor. The opening theme is struggling with looming instrumental chaos that for a moment seems to triumph, only to be ultimately defeated, giving way - or giving birth - to a melody, to music, which, as promised, is &quot;reborn&quot;. &quot;Broken Heart&quot; is yet another piece of elegant, stunning beauty. <BR>Originality, intelligence, seemingly boundless creative energy are but a few characteristics of this truly unique record. However, that its average rating is so unfairly low is nonetheless anything but surprising: remember, it takes time (and perhaps something else) for a passion to be 'spiritualized'.
B00005TT77|5.0|This soundtrack is the most awesome thing I have ever heard.  If you just like the Beatles, you will love this cd!!  Every artist does the songs more than justice and it's just so amazing!! Sarah McLachlan's version of Blackbird is one of the best songs I have ever heard!!
B000002JSP|5.0|First off, I would like to praise everyone else who gave this album 5 stars.  There are lots of people who don't like this album because of the silly &quot;no guitars&quot; response.  If you're going to be that way, then you are not a true Zeppelin fan, but instead just a Jimmy Page fan.<BR>To me, this album gives the 'other' member --John Paul Jones--his well-earned shot at showing the world that HE IS THE MOST TALENTED MEMBER OF THE BAND!!!  As a fellow bassist, I look up to him as one of the best.  But, all bass playing aside, he still plays keyboards (which are NOT evil if used correctly, which he did) and does arrangements, and does those well.<br />&quot;In The Evening&quot; - The 'classic' Zeppelin rocker is one for everybody to enjoy.  One of those songs that just gets my blood flowing with its guitar riffs and Plant's vocals, which aren't spectacular on this song, but still amazing.<br />&quot;South Bound Saurez&quot; - Now this song is the 'sleeper' of the album.  I bought the album not knowing what exactly this song would bring to the table.  It brought a lot, and that's all that is needed to say.  But perhaps I'm the only one who actually likes this one.<br />&quot;Fool In The Rain&quot; - This one would be better if I didn't hear it all the time on radio and such.  Still a great feel-good song, and makes this album even better.<br />&quot;Hot Dog&quot; - First things first: I enjoy every song on this album.  However, if I were to get rid of one track, it would take no time for me to dispose of this.  The bluegrass-country sound is hilarious, to say the least, but this song does not measure up to the other six.<br />&quot;Carouselambra&quot; - This is really more like three songs than it is one.  However, this WAS the song that, for me, promoted this album from 'Nice gift idea' to 'MUST BUY NOW!!!'  The first movement of this methodical epic has what I would call the second-best 'hypnotic repetetive rhythm,' falling only to the mighty &quot;Kashmir&quot;from Physical Graffiti.  This is probably the song where most of the disagreements between other Zep fans and I come.  I absolutely love it!<br />&quot;All My Love&quot; - In my opinion, this song is the best on the album, and may be one of the 5 best Zeppelin songs of all time, definitely in the top 10 with tunes like &quot;Rock And Roll&quot;, &quot;Kashmir&quot;, &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot;, &quot;Thank You&quot;, etc.  The song's beauty is matched only by that of Led Zeppelin II's &quot;Thank You&quot;, and I never grow tired of hearing this song.  All in all, you can't live without this one.<br />&quot;I'm Gonna Crawl&quot; - Robert Plant's voice prevails over all in this one.  I might consider buying an album where the words are simply 'Every little bit, every little bit, every little bit...' just to hear that sound.<br />To me, this album rounds out the career (I'm not counting CO DA) of the greatest rock and roll band of all time.  Not just hard rock or heavy metal.  Better than The Beatles.  Better than The Stones.  Better than Elvis.  I believe that Led Zeppelin is only one of three bands (the others being The Beatles and Queen) where you must have LOTS AND LOTS more than just a 'Greatest Hits' album to really have enough.  <BR>This album is NOT the best Zeppelin album ever (how dare we blaspheme Physical Graffiti that way), but that is a hard title to win.  I do think, however, that it is better than the majority of albums from any time period, and that gets it that fifth star that eludes many albums in my ratings.
6302293553|5.0|I just love this movie!  It is just too funny.  From Roger the Shrubber to Bring out your dead!  The only draw back is that is ends abruptly...almost as if they ran out of time.  But a wonderfully funny movie!
B00000IAU3|5.0|Dido's album kicks major rump!   Not only is it well written and well played, but it also is very easy to listen to.  The songs are emotional, inspirational, and they really make you think about life and your relationships that you make throughout life.  I can honestly say that I've never heard any other album like it.  Dido truly has her own unique style. Go buy it, and you wont regret it!
0800177363|5.0|It's hard to review a film that is so wonderful. You never had a reason to stop this film.  There was never a dull moment.  Though looking at an institution was very disturbing, meeting the people who live in one and the way they are treated was very interesting.
B00005QDW1|3.0|This Cd is a weird one to rate. <BR>     On one side, it doesn't really sound like No doubt. It is more of a Hip-Hop/Pop thing. People who are looking for the music they heard in &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; and &quot;Return of Saturn&quot; won't like this CD at all. They might get pretty mad about it too, the fact that they paid 15 buck for a CD they hate.(Like me, Ha Ha.) It isn't really the kind of music for those Ska, Rock, and Alt. fans at all.<BR>     On the other hand, it is an unusal sound. Not new, but unusaly diffrent and nice. If you like things like &quot;Pink&quot; you will like this. This CD appeals more to Hip-Hop, Pop, and Dance fans.<BR>      I didn't like this CD at all. But I was expecting more of a Ska/Alt. Rock sound, and its not that at all. and it isn't so detestable that I am ashamed to have the name Gwen. But it really depends on what kind of music you listen to.<BR>     I gave it three stars for half/half.
0671027344|3.0|The format of this story brings a whole new meaning to the idea of character analysis.  What regularly would be a typical deception of the life a high school student ended up being a total plot twister.  All the events that occurred in the story somehow ended up having a twist in them.  That is what makes this story so interesting.  One moment, you think something is going to happen but just the opposite occurs.  This adds to the ever growing plot of the story. Charlie's point of view on things is always interesting.
B000001OAA|5.0|This is one of those CD's that comes with me on long drives. You're guaranteed a great mix of songs. <br />If you feel like slow and spooky, there's A Stroke of Luck (&quot;Here comes the cold again, I feel it closing in..&quot;) and Queer (&quot;The queerest of the queer hide inside your head&quot;). <br />Extra brooding? Then try Only Happy When it Rains, of course (&quot;I only listen to the sad, sad songs&quot;), Milk (&quot;I am cruel, but I'd be love and sweetness, if I had you&quot;), or My Lover's Box (&quot;Send me an angel to love&quot;). <br />And when you're ready to get a little more upbeat you've got Fix Me Now (&quot;bring me back to life&quot;), to get angry there's Vow (&quot;I came to drag you down, I came around to tear your little world apart&quot;), for chiding there's Stupid Girl (&quot;Don't believe in anything that you can't break&quot;).<br />A great, great album.
1573228737|3.0|Reader, have a care.  This grim & claustrophobic tale by the author of Tipping the Velvet has none of that novel's raffish humor.   Sarah Waters continues to dazzle with her verbal skill & her mastery of plot; the brutal twist at the book's end comes as a true shock.  But prison scenes of graphic cruelty and a narrative voice from the point of view of a pitiable, deluded protagonist conspire to drag Affinity down, down, down.  Brilliant -- but excruciating.
B000002AGN|5.0|An incredibly novel concept at the time, Brubeck launced almost a whole different genre within a genre with TIME OUT.  The two most distinctive and famous tracks are &quot;Take Five&quot; and &quot;Blue Rondo a la Turk,&quot; without question, but the others stand on their own, as well.  If you programmed out those two tracks, the CD sounds great still.<br />&quot;Take Five&quot; sounds so natural in its odd time signature, 5/4.  Brubeck really takes a back seat on this tune, playing the same six chords in the first measure hundreds of times consecutively, while the other guys shine in solos and improvisational work.  Desmond is great on the sax, but Morrello really shines on the drums.  He does some incredible soloing over the top of Brubeck's repetitive piano work.  It was nice to see this song get some recognition and notoriety in an episode of ER a few years ago:  Doug Ross and Mark Green were driving out in California, and virtually the entire song was used as foreground music, not just a ten-second clip in the background.<br />The liner note explanation of the title of &quot;Blue Rondo&quot; is almost as fascinating as the song itself.  Al Jarreau, an irrepresible vocalist, put lyrics to it and recorded it on one of his CDs (Breakin' Away, I believe--it's very cool!).  The other tracks are great, even if a bit overshadowed by the big two.<br />Bottom Line:  Brubeck may be on the second tier of jazz greats according to many jazz critics and experts (some might put him even lower), but this CD stands in select company and on a very short list of great, influential, and accessible jazz CDs.  It is absolutely indispensable.  TIME FURTHER OUT, a follow-up CD is well worth checking into, as well.
0316776963|3.0|First of all, props to Sedaris for revealing so much about his life....  It wouldn't have been easy.  Especially about his dark days when he abused drugs and what not.  When I picked up this book, I saw all the quotes of reviews on and insides the book.  The reviews were very favorable.  They all said that this book is so funny that you won't stop laughing.  I guess it wouldn't be a lie if I said that I decided to read this book solely on the reviews.  Maybe that was my mistake.  Maybe I just didn't get what Sedaris was talking about.  The book did have some clever and funny parts.  But I didn't think that the book lived up to my expectations.  <BR>Me talk pretty one day actually pretty easy to read.  I liked how Sedaris did not use big fancy words to impress who knows what?  Oh, I appreciated how he talked about the drugs he had used.  It was as if I was right next to him when he was high.  Naturally, I promised again to myself that I really shouldn't touch any drugs. <BR>Even though his stories can get very strange, Sedaris does a very good job in painting a picture in readers' minds of what is going on in his life.<BR>The part of the book I enjoyed most was his childhood life.  His odd interpretation of the world was very interesting and also hilarious.  But I was disappointed as the story went on.<BR>I recommend this book to anyone who is open minded about life.  This book is amusing and makes you appreciate YOUR LIFE!  When you read this book, you just compare your life with Sedaris's and you will thank God you're not David Sedaris.
0425107469|3.0|Travis, the character that finds the dog, nearly killed me.  After reading that everyone that gets to know him dies horribly, I decided it is best to stay away from him.  Besides, his traumas grew humorous as they piled dead-body on dead-body.<br />Maybe I am too fearful, but reading about him made me scared I too might get jinxed.
B000056K04|2.0|Overproduced is putting it lightly.  Gone is the grassroots, guitar-based music that the DMB has always done best, replaced by some Alanis Morrisette-sounding emo-pop (no surprise, given the new producer).  After the adventuresome 'Before These Crowded Streets', I expected even further explorations in musicianship from the group.  Instead, it appears that Glen Ballard inspired DMB to produce an album almost completely without substance.  The group doesn't even have a keyboard player, yet from listening to 'Everyday', one would think that the band is centered around a synthesizer.  Down with Ballard!
B00000K19E|5.0|Great action and creative.  I can not wait until the next movies come out.  I would recommend this to all.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and on dvd.  I have worked in and studied musical theater for years and do not typically enjoy movie musicals, because you can never connect to a tv as you can to seeing something live.  During the first few minutes I was a bit overwhelemed by the camera shots but soon was able to get into the story.  I recomend seeing this movie twice, the 1st time you have to get use to the visual experience but when you watch it again you can fall in love with the story.  This movie is very different and refreshing.  The plot is simple but it is visually and emotionally stimulating.  Even my husband loved it and his idea of a great movie classic is James Bond or Adam Sandler.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|What a wonderful movie.  My 2, 5, 8 and 38 year olds love this movie.  I enjoy it as well.  It is very funny and can be watched over and over.  The extras are fun too.  Myers, Diaz, Murphy and Lithgow rule!
0385484518|5.0|This book is a true story between a mentor and his student. This book teaches you life's greatest lessons about love, life, friends, and family. In this book you meet Morrie Schwartz who was a sociologists at Brandeis University, and one of his many students Mitch Albom. After about two decades Morrie and Mitch are reunited. Morrie now has a terminal illness and spends some of his last months with Mitch. They meet every Tuesday in Morrie's office like they used to back in college. Even though Morrie is very sick he still teaches Mitch everything he has to know about life.
B000002NJS|5.0|This was the album that launched Madonna back into the public knowledge, receiving both commercial and critical success.  Dubbed the mistress of reinvention, 'Ray Of Light' proves this nickname right.  This album delves deep into Madonna's recent interests in Eastern culture, pondering several deep subjects but never becoming overly preachy.<br />No longer settling for simple pop, Madonna has collaborated with William Orbit to great effect.  The dance tunes such as the infectious title track, are well handled and fit well to Madonna's vocals.  It is is these tracks that she really comes alive.  However, that isn't to undervalue the beautiful, and surprisingly poetic, lyrics on the slower songs.  The last track, 'Mer Girl' is especially a revelation of what Madonna can do when she sets her mind to it.  It's not only wonderfully written but it's also peaceful and provoking.<br />Never before has an artist looked into such a variety of musical styles and brought them so successfully into the public's pop knowledge.  The electronica influence is never too overbearing and there are plenty of fantastic ballads here to create a good enough balance anyway.  Of these ballads, the singles are perhaps the best, with Madonna's vocals on 'Frozen' sounding even ethereal.  Of course, what really makes this album stand out is that it's different yet somehow manages to meld it all together successfully.  Or perhaps the best recommendation is that this was the first Madonna album that I've been persuaded to buy off the back of the singles.  Here Madonna has appealed herself not only to the club scene but also to adults.  This album made her cool again, and justifiably so.
6305841861|3.0|After reading the reviews, I thought I was in store for a gore-fest. In reality, Evil Dead 2 offers lots of blood flying around but very little visual gore. Many times there was a good opportunity for gore, but the camera just turned away. Even in the documentary they explain how they used black blood in one scene instead of red in order to get a better movie rating []. I felt ripped off after watching this movie, and it left me wondering what everyone sees in it. People say this movie is funny but I did not see it. The best part was when Ash's dead headless girlfriend came after him with a chainsaw, but once again the scene ended with the camera turning away...
0345440757|1.0|The back of the book says it all.  All of the reviewers are celebrities.  Her section on breast or bottle should be abolished.  Has she read any research on the benefits of breastfeeding?  Makes me wonder if she is paid by the formula companies.  Any person with sense should notice that she does not have any evidence or research to back up her claims.  Do not buy this book for a new mother.  Babies on schedules?  She is just a LA person trying to become famous.  I don't think she has any qualifications to write a baby book that could have a negative influence on parents and babies.
B000059PPN|3.0|Warning: spoilers ahead, if you don't want to know what happens don't read on. <br />I would rate this film a 4, but I had to subtract a star for 2 annoying characters (the dad and Bob), a long boring period in the first half of the movie, and an ending that was very unsatisfying.<BR>First off, the violence and gore is top notch- Fulci delivers the goods big time although you have to wait a while to get to the good scenes. Some of the highlights: knife through the skull, lady gets polked full of holes and her blood squirts all over the place in massive quantities (hard to watch), a guy's throat gets ripped open and blood gushes like a fountain, Dr. Freudstein is stabbed and globs of maggots fall out of his wounds, a girl gets her throat slashed and then (my favorite) her head bounces down the stairs. The deaths were very graphic and on par with the Beyond although very different. Dr. Freudstein is a great monster, and it was awesome when we get to see him for the first time. I have to say that the father was the biggest wuss and I cheered when he got slaughtered. The kid Bob deserved to die too because he was so stupid and annnoying. I felt cheated when he got away at the end. Overall worth seeing for true horror fans, and as with any horror dvd make sure you get the unrated version as I'm sure the R-rated one is heavily edited.
6305265666|5.0|Perhaps when you expect nothing out of a movie and get in abundance it leaves you spellbound. I watched the movie and since then I could think of nothing else. <BR>It is perfect...(the english accent notwithstanding). <BR>Drew Barrymore was great, so was Angelica Huston, so was Maegan Dodd.<BR>But how come so few of the reviewers are forgetting to mention Dougray Scott?! The man was fabulous!<BR>The dialogues were great...(\\"You're looking well Marguarite\\"...\\"You are Welcome to look your Highness\\") and some such.<BR>We want to see more of such movies! Cheers!
B00000IQMT|2.0|First, the track arrangemnt dosen't make any sense. Second, this CD contains pieces that were CUT OFF, and lacks so much of the finalized soundtrack found in the movie. Just listen to the first track &quot;Arrival at Naboo&quot; and then compare it to the movie. Listen to &quot;The Droid Invasion&quot; (my favorite piece in the movie) and compare it to the movie, it's different on the CD!. SOME OF THE GOOD MATERIAL WAS LEFT OUT, and the order of the tracks does not match the sequence in the movie. <br />It seems they had made this CD before the movie was even edited. Although it has the music on it, this CD was a complete disappointment for me, and if you'll notice the details - I'm sure you will agree with me.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This guy rocks. This CD rocks! Its amazing, the songs just stick in your head! Anyone who may be going through a quarter life crisis needs this CD!!<br />I rock out to this everyday - its a great mix between jazzy rock and jam...<br />The only thing better then the music on this CD is hearing it live played by John.
B00003CYLT|5.0|Pure enjoyable art.  Journey of Man will showcase your home theatre as well as any DVD you will find.
6304500831|5.0|As a child I saw this movie in a movie theater. When my daughter came along I could not wait to introduce it to her. She is now 5 and it is one of her very favorites. We watch this one as a Family a lot and it is a special delight to us. It is animated fun and my husband and I are still enthralled by the characters. When you see the people who did the voices and personalities of these characters you are really quiet impressed at the talent. And even a bit Thankful because they have brought so many years of delight to children and adults alike by bringing this story to life. It is a definite must have for every Family and do share it grab that bowl of popcorn and sodas and plant it in front of that television and watch your child light up and share the pure joy of the imagination gone fun. You will be delighted that you took the extra fun time too, to share. So will your child.
B00005AQGJ|5.0|2pac is simply the greatest rapper of all time!  This album proves it, this is 2pac in his prime. The whole album flows together as one, and every song is worth listening to from...First to against all odds. He was going through a lot when he was recording this.  This is his deepest album, and if you listen carefully you picture a man of great anger strength and genius. This album is very different from all eyez on me. All eyez on me was more of a party album, Makaveli is a personal album. The lyrics are amazing and the production is top notch quality. No track is slept on, no track fillers every song is bangin. I already have the album, but I'm thinking of buying it again the \\"Remastered\\" version. This is and will be his best album of all time. No matter how many more 2pac albums they put out this will still be the best!
B000002N3J|5.0|I think this is one of her best CD's - the songs in this album are very powerful and they apply to any mood under any circumstances in each person's life.  It's great!!!
B00005OWEG|4.0|The original Apocalypse Now stands as a great movie that I'd give 5 stars.  Redux served as a way for me to critique the editing of the original.  Coppola for years lambasted the edited original many have thought that the original was somehow lacking and that additional footage would have improved the flick.  Francis was wrong Redux is enjoyable but it gives us too much Captain Willard.  Willard was great in the original because he was not a likable character. <BR>The added footage of the surfing sequence was good the helicopter playing a recording of Duvall on a loop imploring Lance to return his surfboard is priceless.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|What is up with everybody saying how great this movie is. I sat in the front row with a friend and we couldnt stand it. It wasnt worth the money we paid to get in, much less our time even. I went to see it because it was getting raving reviews, and she wanted to see it. Well just giving you my review so maybe u can save yourself the time and money. There are so muhc better movies to see. Go see Oceans 11, Bandits or Pearl Harbor.
0920668364|5.0|This book was given to me at my baby shower by a very dear late friend. The first time I read it I cried my eyes out. The book is about the unconditional love between and mother and son until the end of life. Because it is so special to me, I now give this book as a gift at every baby shower I attend.
B000005YZM|5.0|This CD represents one of the top 10 CD's of the 60's. The Doors <BR>no doubt listened to these nerdy British guys A LOT!! If you dig Beatles, Kinks, Who, Pink Floyd, this CD belongs in your collection. Rod Argent was a fool to break up this band. Sorry Dude, nothing personal. <BR>BR
B00005MP58|5.0|This version does great justice to Jane Austen's work.  Casting was well done overall but Colin Firth's portrayal of Mr. Darcy is flawless.  This rates as the best film/TV production of P &amp; P that I have ever seen.  The special edition of the DVD has good picture quality.  You may not be able to stop watching this.
6304698526|5.0|Overall a great combination of writing, acting and special effects (high speed car chase) with a gritty realism that still holds up today. Two of the best muscle cars duke it out, Mustang vs. Charger, and the end of the Charger is high octane. Too bad!! If you are looking for action with some intense cool, then check out Mr McQueen (cool) and Robert Vaughn (greasy slick) in this great flick. Enjoy!!
B00003CXTF|3.0|The only thing this movie is worth to watch for is battle-scenes. <br />But there only something about 40 minutes of them. And another part is Titanic-like story of love. But worse. In every part you may predict what will be next. Too much of pathos. <br />3 stars with really big \\"minus\\". Only for battle scenes.
B00005UWB3|4.0|this movie has made it to the top of my list. Haley Joel Osment is an extremely talented actor. He beautifully portrays the love that a child can posses. Jude Law is a nice comedic touch. The effects that were used to make him look like a robot were magnificant. Truly a masterpiece!
B00005QK3W|1.0|This album was a huge disapointment. It simply lacks every element I am looking for in a well crafted album; melody, intelligent arrangements, production... I much prefer the Flaming Pie album, with the aid and influence of producer Jeff Lynne on some of the tracks.  Ironically enough Driving Rain is just a good example of someone who has gone dry artistically speaking.
B000002J23|4.0|This album has mixed opinions, even with me. When it first came out, I missed Jon Anderson and wasn't too crazy about it with the exception of &quot;Tempus Fugit&quot;.  However, Trevor Horn holds his own well on most songs, especially &quot;Tempus Fugit&quot;, &quot;Machine Messiah&quot;, and &quot;Does It Really Happen&quot;. Also, Geoff Downes has proven here to be a competent keyboardist, fitting in with the style of each song. &quot;Machine Messiah&quot; is the closest to heavy metal style guitar (and that's not a putdown to Steve Howe, one of the most versatile guitarists there are). Horn sings a little lower than Jon Anderson, who would probably have trouble singing the slow parts in the song. Also, Chris Squire compliments Howe's guitar licks with thundering bass. &quot;White Car&quot;, although includes some interesting keyboard work from Geoff Downes, sounds too much like a commercial jingle with its 1 minute limit. &quot;Does It Really Happen&quot; sounds more like the new wave style music with a cool bass lick by Squire and Alan White's drums sound pretty cool. &quot;Into the Lens&quot; is the only truly annoying song on Drama. Though Downes' keyboards are versatile and interesting on this track, the song is ruined by the cheezy &quot;I am a camera, camera, camera&quot; chorus sung ad nauseum. &quot;Run Through the Light&quot; sounds a lot like the music Asia would compose on their debut (which Downes and Howe would be a part of).  Horn tries to sound a little too much like Anderson but Squire's vocals on the chorus are a nice touch. The closing gem is &quot;Tempus Fugit&quot; in which everybody does a great job with White's fast and furious drumming, Howe's flanging guitar, Squire's bass, Downes' futuristic keyboards (which end the album with falsettoed &quot;Yes, yes, yes...&quot;, and Horn's vocals. Although not my favorite Yes album (Yes would temporarily break up after Drama), it gets better with listen. It also helped fellow Buggles Trevor Horn andGeoff Downes (then only known for the new wave novelty &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot;) to move onto bigger and better things for themselves- Horn is now a successful producer (he went on to produce ABC, Paul McCartney, Elvis Costello, and of course, Yes' &quot;90125&quot;) and Downes co-founded Asia (which is still together albiet Downes is now the only original member) and has put out some well produced solo albums.
B00004XMS0|3.0|All things come to an end, good or bad, we all know that. Batman, Batman Returns, and parts of Batman Forever hold up the lackluster star vehicles for Batman & Robin. The first two radiate with powerful storytelling and unerring capacity for mystery and intrigue. Batman Forever changes speed and flips to a comic rendition of Laurel & Hardy while introducing Robin. Some of Tim Burton's handiwork keeps it tolerable. Batman & Robin - well, the only good thing about is sexy Uma Thurman. I do toast a cup to Alfred who's remained a reason to see the last two films...
B000002B7W|5.0|In the words of Wolf Marshall &quot;[Randy Rhoads] left behind a few precious gems of guitar wizardry.&quot;<br />If he hadn't died in a tragic plane crash in 1982, he would've undoubtedly gone on to become the greatest guitar player on Earth.  His musical genius combined with his reputed good nature, made for one extraordinary human being.<br />I believe brevity will do the trick here:  <br />Randy Rhoads was an innovative guitar maestro.  This is the only album that does his memory justice by displaying his skill in a live setting.  Buy it for the guitar mastery, buy it because it's a collection of Ozzy's best songs, buy it because this is an elegy to an era of great guitarists and to a great guitarist.
B00005QK3W|4.0|McCartney, who just turned 60, brings a new life into his music. I had listened over this album once before, poorly reviewed it, but after watching \\"Vanilla Sky,\\" decided to listen to the disc over again. What may have eluded me about this album earlier, I believe, was the sincerity it possesses. Also, at the time of release, \\"Wingspan\\" was stuck in my head. I'm not going to say this is the best album he's ever done, though I will say that it is his most personal since \\"Flaming Pie.\\" McCartney's proven that he can stand the test of time and age by putting out some worthwhile material. I've altered this review, not to appease anyone, but to assess better than a passing glance on it. \\"Freedom,\\" is the one song so weak on the album it could have been pulled from a cracker-jack box. It's a nice catchy tune repeating the same words over some 20 times. \\"Give Ireland Back to the Irish\\" from his early 1970's days fits a cause better and sorry, McCartney was never John Lennon. No matter how much you want it to be so, he's not -not the activist, maybe not as crazy, and certainly not a martyr. Now before you bash me, let's talk about the rest of the album. As personal as \\"Flaming Pie\\" was for Linda, \\"Driving Rain\\" centers on his new wife Heather, it's that blatant. The title track, \\"Magic,\\" \\"Vanilla Sky,\\" are all about him and places he's been. Watch the documentary short on the \\"Vanilla Sky\\" DVD to see what I mean. Sir McCartney is putting out the music for the generations that have grown with him and staying true to his fans. He's not pretending to be anything he's not, or not anymore...maybe with \\"Freedom.\\" Yet I tend to think of \\"Freedom,\\" as a compassionate piece written at a very difficult time which will always be remembered. Now, I'm not going to hamstring you...I don't in my books, and I won't here...it's a catchy tune, but is it another \\"Imagine,\\" \\"Power to the People?\\" No, sorry folks, no. Overall, the album is a good addition to your collection and a welcome comeback.<br />***The reviewer is author of: Amber Spirit: Poems & Stories (Hats Off Books, 2001) and a frequent magazine contributor & short story contest judge. <br />Rated and reviewed by ROBERT ELDRIDGE
B000002UUX|5.0|Truly great heavy metal, much like any other type of music, is a culmination of imagination, creativity, musicality, technical ability, and endurance (meaning the number of times someone can listen to a song without getting tired of it).  Megadeth's 1990 release Rust in Peace is the pinnacle of all those aforementioned points, tightly synthesized into a ~40 minute package.<br />The high points of this album are &quot;Holy Wars...and the Punishment Due&quot;, &quot;Lucretia&quot;, &quot;Tornado of Souls&quot;, and &quot;Hangar 18&quot;.  Marty Friedman's and Dave Mustaine's guitar work is the zenith of rhythym - lead guitar cohesivess.  Friedman's solos are innovative and aesthetically pleasing.  Unlike many other metal guitarists who choose to remain within the same mode during a solo, Friedman's solos are unpredictable, yet melodic.  Many times, this is due to Mustaine's rapid fire rhythym guitar smoothly shifting from one key to another.  Fine examples of this type of amazing metal guitar work can be found on &quot;Hangar 18&quot;, &quot;Lucretia&quot;, and &quot;Holy Wars.&quot;  <br />To top off this duo of guitar histrionics, is the bass playing of Dave Ellefson and drumming of Nick Menza.  Dave Ellefson displays his prowess as a bassist on &quot;Lucretia&quot; and &quot;Dawn Patrol&quot; and provides the musical backdrop that allows Mustaine and Friedman to do their work.  Essentially, Nick Menza is the glue that holds the entire band together.  His superb drumming not only adds punctuation every phrase in each song but is varied and creative throughout the album.<br />Mustaine's lyrics are frighteningly foretelling. &quot;Holy Wars&quot; and &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; describe, in the most clairvoyant detail, the exact state of the world right now.  Although somewhat over the top at times, Mustaine always manages to effectively deride any sort of establishment ranging from big corporations to big goverment.  <br />Rust in Peace is a relentless attack that contains everything essential to a great heavy metal album.  Buy it, and you'll listen to everything that's good about heavy metal.<br />I also recommend:<BR>Megadeth - Peace Sells, Countdown to Extinction, Cryptic Writings<BR>Nevermore - Dead Heart in a Dead World, Dreaming Neon Black<BR>Opeth - Morningrise, Blackwater Park<BR>Metallica - Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets<BR>Ozzy Osbourne - Tribute, Blizzard of Ozz
B00003CX5P|2.0|Cheers and congratulations are in order for ILM's masterful work on this movie, but here's the problem: The story wasn't thought out enough and bores it's way to the Jedi duel. Lucas should have paid attention when constructing sets that look more modern than the original (Star Trek's Enterprise could do the same in some areas). There is too much backstory to be told and I'm sure the script didn't allow enough running time to delve deep into Anakin, the Jedi Council, or even Yoda. There are a lot of things we still don't know, and maybe would if the pod race & Jar Jar weren't taking up that time...
B000002B7M|5.0|This is one of my favorite rock/metal albums of all time. Everything that's good and devilish about Ozzy is wrapped up in this CD. In my opinion, this album is the essential Ozzy collection - if you only own one Ozzy CD, this should be it.<br />Memorable riffs with evil and clever lyrics are the reasons that this album has stood the test of time. Not to mention that Randy Rhoads' introduction to Crazy Train is perhaps the most recognized riff in rock today (along with Iron Man and Smoke on the Water). The driving force behind the aura and the spirit of the album is Ozzy's demented persona and world view.<br />However, the driving force behind the music is Randy Rhoads, in my opinion. Every time I think of him and what happened to him, it's very depressing. This album is the pinnacle of the guitar genius' art form. His solos will live on the memories of Ozzy fans and guitarists forever, and no guitarist will ever come close to executing the lightning-fast fills Randy improvised during his performance. Even if you're not an Ozzy fan, this album is worth buying simply because of the Rhoads factor.<br />With Blizzard, Ozzy showed the world that he could be bigger than Black Sabbath. Buy it and find out for yourself!
B00005JKHP|5.0|I recommend watching the original VHS version of this film first. After that, take a break and absorb what you saw. Now, put this DVD in and prepare for the new \\"Human Adventure.\\" The Directors Edition has plenty in the way of bonus footage, but let's get to the film...you haven't seen it like this. Aside from the obvious, that it is DVD, everything has been changed and the full story is told. This edition shows you a beautiful scene on Vulcan...and that is the only spoiler. Robert Wise has done a fabulous job of completing the story that he could not in 1979. Nothing is thrown in, or taken out, that didn't belong to bring the movie the depth it deserved. I don't want to spoil anything more...seeing is believing...
0767803434|3.0|This is a highly entertaining film in which Harrison Ford plays an American president who puts his money where his mouth his. Russian dissidents who believe in the old order seize control of Air Force One, hoping that the hostages will force the Americans to persuade the Russian premier to release a prominent Russian soldier. Once released, the threat of another cold war can only be the blink of an eye away.<br />While the White House ponders on how to deal with the situation, the president has remained on board Air Force One, determined to rescue the hostages.<br />This is a very good fil, well-paced and well acted. The commentary by Wolfgand Peterson reveals many interesting facts about the film including the professionalism of Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman.<br />My only complaint is about two sequences involving Air Force One - this is a personal thing. I hate action or stunt scenes which stretch credibility. The first scene, when Air Force One has just landed but the hijackers take off again is a little bit unbelievable. The second scene, at the end, is not only ridiculous and laughable, it is a very poor effect - looking as if the budget has just run out. Ironically, Wolfgang Peterson states that a lot of money was spent on this and he was impressed.<br />Still, if you enjoy a good action film which is also an edge-of-the-seat thriller, this is a good choice.
B00005QDW1|1.0|OK, major disappointment.  All the songs sounded the same.  I didn't think the lyrics or the music was very interesting or different.  I really liked 'Return To Saturn' - but, this doesn't even sound like the same band.
B00005QDW1|4.0|I'll admit right up front that I'm not easy to please. So when I went into the local cd store and asked two of the female sales clerks what they thought of the new No Doubt, and they gave me less than glowing reviews based on the single, I was VERY apprehensive. But when I put it into the cd player of my car for the drive home, I had a ... grin on my face that a plastic surgeon couldn't have removed! The group has matured and they are ready to take on more complex material while still having a helluva lot of fun! Everyone who has heard my copy has gone out to buy their own... except the intransigent fans of No Doubt's earlier work who just can't let go. No, it's not rock... but fans of Madness will instantly understand why ND's new release is called ROCK STEADY!
B00005O5CM|4.0|Legally Blonde is one of the craziest movies I've ever seen.  Reese Witherspoon shows that she truly has a knack for crazy blonde-moment comedies.<br />The movie centers around Elle Woods and her relentless pursuit of the man of her dreams, whom she had been dating until he told her (on the night she thought he would propose) that she didn't fit properly into his family's ideals for a suitable future spouse for him.  This is when she did what every rational woman would do...<br />Apply for admission to Harvard Law School--where her ex was supposed to attend.  She studied her butt off and finally got in.  Then, she realised that this wasn't going to be as easy as she had hoped.<br />Eventually, everything goes the right way for her, which wasn't exactly the way she originally planned...and everyone (well, almost) gets not just what they want, but what they need.
B00005OB0A|5.0|I can't blame you. This is one of the best pop singles ever... it has such a simple structure but once you've heard it, it will stick to your mind forever.<br />This album is definitely not as good as the flawless Light years... I'd even say that &quot;Dancefloor&quot;, &quot;Give it to me&quot; are fillers. But still, it's better than all the teen pop available in America.<br />No, there are no other songs that can compete with &quot;Can't get you out of my head&quot;. Still, my favorites are &quot;In your eyes&quot; (2nd single), &quot;Love affair&quot;, &quot;Fever&quot; and &quot;Tightrope&quot; (Australian bonus track). <br />Hopefully, the American release of this album will give Kylie the definitive worldwide recognition as pop princess.
0790720434|4.0|a very cute movie with really good actors! Note: the scenery is amazing! It makes you wonder if it is all real! I would highly recomend it.
B00005LOUP|5.0|I saw this movie and fell in love with it. I'm not the type to watch movies over and over but this was such a great movie that I could't help but watch hundreds of times. Jim Carrey did a wonderful job doing the grinch and Ron Howard has made a great movie that i will watch every year for years and years to come
B00005OM4N|5.0|I see all this huge letters for the reviews for Britney's albums. They go, I LOVE BRITNEY! or BRITNEY IS HOT! Me, I can't even begin to describe the wonderful emotions that I go through when I turn on her album. Her music is enjoyable, she is NOT afraid of taking chances, and her sexy dialouge really rocks! She is a terrific role model! Here is a personal review of the emotions you get when you hear her songs:<br />I'm a Slave 4 U - sexy, danceable, fun, and moreover, you slip into a trance for that special someone...<br />Overprotected - one of her best songs ever! It shows that no one should be treated like a doormat, and that you cannot let people handle YOUR life<br />Lonely - This song is really really fun! Upbeat hip hop rhythms that make you want to get up and DANCE!!!<br />I'm not a girl, not yet a Woman - ATTENTION ALL TEENAGE GIRLS!!!! THIS SONG IS A MUST, A TOTAL GUIDE TO LIFE!<br />Boys - What can I say? I'm a nice girl, and boys are just fine! <br />Anticipating - a flash of the old Britney in this song, like Soda Pop. The kind of song that makes you just wanna go out and party.<br />I Love Rock n' Roll - This sassy remix is an amazing spark of attitude that makes you go 'wow' each time you hear it. I really love it.<br />Cinderella - My favorite song. Pop and sweet, but far from teeny bopper. Britney is not a girl, almost a woman, and that shows even in her sweetest most fun little songs and tunes. She is very sweet though! Sugar and spice is how I describe Britney! I love this song!<br />Let Me Be - Leave me alone, get off me, expressive feelings that you get when you're mad at overprotective parents or annoying boyfriends. I adore this song and the new step that Britney is taking in music.<br />Bombastic Love - A very different kind of love, another one of those sugar and spice songs. Loving it, loving it, don't stop me now I'm on a role!<br />That's Where you Take Me - this song can truely make you cry. Not so much the words as Britney's mesmerizingvoice. She takes you away on a magical journey back to that special guy or girl. Dreamy and romantic. Very special. I always think of Britney's guy, Justin Timberlake. What can I say, I LOVE the guy! Just like I love this song.<br />What It's Like to Be Me - Turn up the volume! Yes, Justin sings in this song. A fun, pumping song. If you haven't heard it, prepare yourself for an experience like noneother. <br />I hope you enjoy this album as much as I did. It truely changed my life. Britney, I love you girl. We're with you. I am so devoted to you (and your boyfriend!) As far as music goes, you will always be on top.
B000002UA9|4.0|This is a fantastic debut album, but not one of the Beatles' highlights.  The music, although energetic, is often very simple.  Some people like this.  Some people don't.<br />The covers on this album are particularly good and include \\"Anna (Go To Him),\\" \\"Baby It's You,\\" and \\"Twist And Shout.\\"<br />In addition, Lennon/McCartney wrote some classics with \\"I Saw Her Standing There,\\" \\"Please Please Me,\\" \\"Love Me Do,\\" \\"P.S. I Love You,\\" and especially \\"Do You Want To Know A Secret\\" with George's distinctive and endearing voice.<br />Sadly, many of the covers and original compositions are of not of stellar quality.<br />This album is not essential, but if you buy it you won't be disappointed.  I recommend buying the Red Album and Blue Album (the \\"Best of\\" albums) first.  If you like the really early tracks from the Red Album, then pick this title up.  Otherwise, there are many other great Beatles' albums to pick from.
0679735259|1.0|I started the book several months ago and stopped reading it because I didn't like the style of writing. I started it again last month and struggled to finish it. Herr's writing style is awful. He talks and talks and talks without really saying anything. He may described, for example, a soldier's fear in the jungle. However, Herr gets so chatty with his word imagery that one cannot really follow what he is trying to describe. His style of writing reminds me of Dennis Hopper's character in Apocalypse Now - constant chatter without really saying anything and not understanding what he just said! I would not waste my time again on this book. I was expecting something akin to Caputo's \\"A Rumor of War\\". Now, THAT book was good. I recommend skipping Herr's \\"Dispatches\\".
B000002UAF|5.0|This is one of the stronger early Beatles albums despite the fact that it has only 30 minutes of music.<br />This is the one pre-1966 album that I can play without skipping tracks.  Every song is strong.  Unlike \\"Help!\\" and \\"With The Beatles,\\" this album has great songs that don't find their way onto the Red Album.<br />If you are a new fan and don't want to shell out the cash for a pair of double albums (I'm referring to the Red Album and the Blue Album, which are the \\"Best of\\" albums), then go for this one.  But, there are two exceptions...<br />1) if you can afford the double album price tag, buy the aforementioned compilations, then go for the regular releases.<br />2) if you know that you like the later material better than the early stuff (and can't afford the double albums), then buy Abbey Road.<br />This is a great album.  Eventually try to fit it into your collection.  It may or may not become your favorite, but it will add a nice dimension to your Beatles collection.
B000005HN6|5.0|When I first heard Opeth, I was mystified. The single, clear thought that swam through my head was, &quot;What the--!?&quot; &quot;In the Mist She was Standing,&quot; the first track on the debut Orchid, explains my reaction. Glorious but heavy guitars (care of Mikael Akerfeldt and Peter Lindgren), a deft &amp; tuneful bass accompaniment (Johan de Farfalla), the complex drumming (Anders Nordin), and the fierce growls and enigmatic poetry (again, Akerfeldt) makes it all seem like ordinary death/black metal. Strikingly melodic, yes. Intense, definitely. Poetic, of course. But otherwise conventional.<br />But listen more. The song is 13-minutes long. The band's apparent demeanor changes moods on a dime by dropping the heaviness for beautiful acoustic passages and softly sung vocal sections (this is done often). It's consistently very melodic. The lyrics are dark and romantic, not violent or Satanic. There's also the cover, with its nice pink flower. Quite a contrast from the blood-splattered, diabolic art of many bands in the metal section, eh? &quot;What the--!?&quot;<br />Few debut albums are written and recorded with such maturity and sophistication that they sound years beyond the incipient factors normally ascribed to a band's first release. Orchid is by far one of the most astonishing debut albums I've ever heard. The finesse and tightness embodying the band's progressive music this early in their careers is just unbelievable. I would have never guessed it was a debut if I hadn't known beforehand. I can't name many bands whose debut is this interesting...and even fewer whose debut is so original. The band has grown, obviously (their 2001 release Blackwater Park exemplifies their progress over the years), but this is still an astonishing release. Remember, it's a debut!<br />I don't think anyone can call this death metal or black metal. It's metal, yep, but otherwise it's impossible to pigeonhole. I agree with another reviewer that it is &quot;Opeth Metal.&quot; The music is heavy, but melodic. It is never brutal or abrasive like, say, Cannibal Corpse (which I hate and it makes me nauseous). There are no blastbeats, no Satanic lyrics about eating babies (yes, I'm stereotyping). This is just good, melodic progressive metal -- twin guitar harmonies, heavy riffs, reams of acoustic passages, and a blend of death/black vox and low, chilling clean vox. At this stage in their careers, Opeth's songwriting style is fairly unique. Their approach makes the beginning and end of each song almost arbitrary. Since each Opeth song is a sequence of musical &quot;scenes,&quot; the album could almost pass as one full song. Usually I would criticize a band for this lack of structure, but Opeth never loses my interest. I guess they must be doing something right. They've got a very different &amp; good thing going on here. (Starting on Still Life, their fourth album, they would start to introduce conventional things like &quot;choruses&quot; [what? choruses?] into their songs.) However, if any debut characteristic is to be found, it's the production. It's still pretty good, but sometimes the soft vocals are too quiet and the bass isn't as rumbling. But that's the only complaint I have...not bad for a first album.<br />It's hard to discuss individual songs because there aren't really any that stick out more than others, and they are all pretty similar. Well, &quot;Silhouette&quot; is different...just a short piano piece. Everything else (except the interlude &quot;Requiem&quot;) is pretty long, usually around the 10-minute mark, full of the band's characteristic diversity -- the acoustic sections, the heavy parts, the eclectic vocals....and the absolute beauty of it all. The lyrics are usually abstract musings on love. Combined with the music, they are romantic and often sad. The music often has a medieval touch influencing the melodies.<br />Look, I'll level with you here. I'm trying to make this album sound good so you buy it. It's truly incredible, but heck if I can eloquently convey this band's supreme greatness. It's impossible to dissect the goodness of Opeth's debut and articulate it. The best reviews for this album are those that express enthusiasm for the music without explaining all the songs. I don't do that too well...but it feels right to add my voice to the chorus of acclaim this band is getting.<br />Listening to Opeth is like falling in love with a woman who is beautiful in both body and mind. You are drawn to her exquisite appearance, but it takes time to really gain a full appreciation for the depth of her character. Over time, love grows, and the relationship gets more rewarding. Opeth is like that...it starts good, and gets much better over time. This is not a band that you listen to for a while then forget...it is an enduring experience, and a promise of reward. Listening to Orchid and enjoying it is like a gift that offers ineffable delight.<br />The true spirit of great music is here.ible, but heck if I can eloquently convey this band's supreme greatness.

B00005QZ7U|1.0|Add me to the list of those who &quot;just don't get it&quot;.  All of the superlatives one can read about the visually stunning sets and costumes, the quality of singing, the moxie needed to even conceive of such an anachronistic musical interpretation... forget 'em.  The irritation afforded me by these distractions negated any desire to develop an appreciation for the sappy plight of the characters, the too-confusing plot, and the mediocre singing. I struggled valiantly for an hour, waiting in vain to reach some plateau of even minimal enjoyment, before stopping the DVD and my misery.  I've loved many films that required the total suspension of disbelief, but this wasn't one of them.
B00004S96B|5.0|(The review title is a bit cheesy, but it sounds good, right?)<br />This is the first 24 karat gold disc that has become a part of my collection. It was also the only one I really wanted. However, I delayed for a long time. After all, Empire is one of the best recorded rock albums ever (and one of my favorite albums). Could the gold disc be that much better? It professes to &quot;reproduce the ultimate sound of a classic recorded performance without the digital harshness and irregular plated surface of standard aluminum discs.&quot; This is supposed to have a great effect on the recording. (Until recently I foolishly thought these discs were just funky items for ostentatious collectors.)<br />I received this CD as a gift, and now I can assuredly say I was stupid for the hesitation. As good as Empire was recorded before, this is way better. Every last instrumental ingredient is remarkably strong and identifiable. The hard rocking songs, like &quot;Empire&quot; and &quot;Jet City Woman,&quot; have so much more punch. The clarity of the rumbling bass, coruscating guitar lines, and shivery hissing cymbals call even more attention to the band's superb instrumental ability. (I've gained much more appreciation for Scott Rockenfield as a drummer because of this). The &quot;human instrument,&quot; Geoff Tate, has never sounded better. On &quot;Silent Lucidity&quot; it sounds like he's in the same room with you. On the same song, the orchestra's cadence glimmers with ten times the intoxicating power. Beautiful!<br />The greatest effect of the gold disc is heard on one of my favorite 'Ryche songs, &quot;Anybody Listening?&quot; It is definitely the best song ever written about being in the spotlight. I like Queen's &quot;The Show Must Go On,&quot; Rush's &quot;Limelight,&quot; and the pertinent songs on Marillion's Afraid of Sunlight album, but this is way better. The heavy, textured arrangement sounds more visceral and penetrative, increasing its emotional resonance.<br />More casual fans may not be willing to buy the gold disc, but anyone who loves Empire should definitely invest in this indispensable release.re casual fans may not be willing to buy the gold disc, but anyone who loves Empire should definitely invest in this indispensable release.
B000002LOE|5.0|I love this CD. The upbeat pop sound mixed with rap of &quot;Radio Song&quot;, and the absolutely fun &quot;Shiny Happy People&quot;, both are great songs to listen to. And of course, the hit &quot;Loosing My Religion&quot; which speaks volumes. I also enjoyed the vocals on &quot;Low&quot;- they are quite different and add variety to the CD.
B000002H97|5.0|With this album Metallica got so famous that until today this album sold more than 30 million copies. This album as you all know came out in 1991 and because of the success of this album Metallica signed a contract of 2 years of live shows all over the world. The major reason to the success all over the world of this album are &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; and &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot;. &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; is the most famous song of nineties, period. &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; was also a huge success and has the greatest riff ever. But let's not forget all the other songs on this album. &quot;Wherever I May Roam&quot; is one of my top-5 Metallica song ever. &quot;Don't Tread On Me&quot; and &quot;Sad But True&quot; (&quot;Sad But True&quot; really reminds me &quot;Devil's Dance&quot; from Reload for some reason) are just such a fun to listen to. &quot;Through The Never&quot; is fast and fiery, &quot;Of Wolf And Man&quot; has a great riff and musically it's just great, &quot;The God That Failed&quot; has incredible bass and lyrics, &quot;My Friend Of Misery&quot; is another good track and &quot;The Struggle Within&quot; is the perfect closing for any album. This album is more than great but hardly the best of Metallica. BUT, this album is what I call maturity. Metallica grew up as a band and this album shows it.
630281474X|5.0|This is one of the best, if not the best, Hammer film. It's tasteful, intelligent, erotic and fun. Kinda like me.<BR>If only the others had kept this high quality, tightly directed format. <br />Get it.
B000002JKA|5.0|At first, I didn't like Awake very much, since it bears less than a passing resemblance to DT's previous masterpiece, Images & Words.  However, the DT of Awake still retains all which made I&W great, but with a heavier, less flashy sound.  This new style works to incredible heights on songs like \\"Lie\\", and \\"Scarred\\" as John Petrucci rips and wails on his seven-string.  \\"Space-Dye Vest\\" is a superb song, based around a nice piano riff, building to an atmospheric chorus; it is one of DT's best ever.  The only reason I don't like this album as much as I&W is that while nearly every song on I&W incredible, a fair number on this disk aren't quite on that level, being \\"merely great.\\"  This is DT's second best work, so pick it up today!
B00003CXRM|5.0|I like this film. While predictable, the take on the Odyssey adds a depth that satidfies intellectually while increasing the comic element.<br />The characters are casted wonderfully. Clooney, with his winsome smile and fast talking, while not exactly Odysseus (a man of many turnings and ways) is terrific and entertaining. The supporting characters, though, is what makes this film delightful.<br />Good for the whole family
6301955609|5.0|my love for jodoroswky has begun with his books rather than his movies... I expected a lot from this movie and all my expectations have been fullfilled. it's a suberb work of photography, costume design, settings, screenplay everything is perfect in this movie. the diversity of references (from the mystical religious world to modern american culture influences at some stages) are here combined with splendour. with some resemblance of fellini -almodovar but possibly at a greater level. i wouldn't classify this as an horror movie. it's a piece about life and emotions, greatly curated on a psychological level too.<BR>beautiful and daring piece of art, as art should be.<BR>try this if you are looking for something new made in respect of many precious traditions.

B00005QB9A|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Its story is original, touching, deep... it's a wonderful movie!
B00005BJ2O|3.0|As the title of the CD itself says on the front, &quot;Music from Baz Luhrmann's film Moulin Rouge&quot;.  NONE of the score (what little there is) made it on this CD (ie: the end credits roll didn't make it), and the tracks which do exist sound different than the music heard in the film (often times, you'll hear an extra vocalist in addition to Ewan McGregor or Nicole Kidman, apperently in an effort to &quot;improve&quot; the music somehow-- this in fact detracts from the music, in my opinion).  Missing sequences includes any sequence involving the &quot;Sound of Music&quot;, or any sequence including Nirvana's &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; (the long dance sequence towards the beginning of the film).  A worthy buy if you REALLY enjoyed the music listed in the track listing, but if you're looking for any of the music I've listed as missing above, you'll need to look elsewhere.  (I've seen on CDNow that a new Moulin Rouge CD is due out sometime in January '02, but can't find it on Amazon-- perhaps this newer CD will address these issues.)
B0000028RR|5.0|This is completely different than the hardcore/punk I usually listen to, but this is truly amazing stuff. Zach de la Rocha can really spit out awe-inspiring lurics, and Morrellos guitar riffs are nothing short of fantastic. These guys are extremely political, one of the big reasons I'm into them, and they also just plain rock hard. Sometimes its nice to take a break from DOA or the Anti-Flag to start your own little mosh-pit while listening to 'Killing in the Name of' ( F**K You I wont do what ya tell me!). The best tracks are Bombtrack, Killing in the Name Of, and Wake Up. You have to start moshing when listening to De La Rocha scream WAKE UP at the top of his lungs. Try it out, whether you're a punk or a Limp Bizkit boy or whatever- its fun for the whole family.
B00003OSSL|1.0|This movie features two miscast actors in an otherwise inferior story-line. I think I'll read the novel that it was based on to see where the writer/director/producer went wrong...I would recommend that to you as well before renting, or buying this Turkey.
B00005A1VG|5.0|Why is this not on AFI's Top 100 films list??  The best action/adventure movie of all time and still stands up to any current day attempt at great filmmaking.  I am looking forward to a legit DVD release but until then I will continue to enjoy my 'imported' Tawain DVD.....
B00005RHGK|2.0|The shame is, the movie was doing fairly well with me for the first 1/2 or so, but then started going tradgically wrong!  <BR>The movie pretty much starts with a good chase scene, that really does raise some goosebumps.    <BR>The movie then goes into a bunch of classic horror movie cliches, and even acknowledges the fact.  The sister says something to her brother about how there is a point in all horror movies where someone does something stupid, and that's what he was doing.  Would have been funny in Scream, but not here where they weren't trying to be a spoof.  The scenes in the church basement were disturbing enough to be scary, but then the movie turned into a really, really bad made-for-tv movie.  <BR>You never really care about the main characters in the movie.  You never really care about the monster, or how or why he exists.  One line in the entire movie tries to explain The Creeper.  One line?  To explain a flesh eating monster who can't be stopped?  Um, alright.  <BR>The performances were terrible.  <BR>I am a fan (not a big fan, but a fan) of the horror movie genre.  What makes them fun is being scared, being grossed out, and believing (if even slightly) in what is going on in the film.  You get none of the above in this one in the second half.  The first half was decent (hence the two stars) but the second half ruins any of the good they did earlier in the film.  The end was pathetic, but I was at least glad it was finally over.<BR>I remember when this came out, I was thinking that it would be a good rental.  It wasn't even worth the rental fee.  <BR>Avoid this at all costs!
B000002J1S|5.0|Just like the title's namesake, the concept is based on a street kid named Rael who goes through various transformations, possibly to get into heaven, like one reviewer stated. This story is nearly impossible and difficult to figure out totally, but...it's also quite a scary album. It's dark, moody and mesmerizing. The many times I've listened to it, as well as reading the lyrics (Lilywhite Lilith/The Waiting Room, Riding The Scree/It, etc.) I wind up feeling somewhat frightened.<br />Anyway, musically it has tons of melody and variation ranging from classically influenced rock (The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway)<br />heavy prog-rock (Counting Out Time, Lilywhite Lilith), absorbing and moody instrumentals (Hairless Heart, Silent Sorrow In Empty Boats, Broadway Melody Of 1974) and downright idiosyncratic numbers (Cuckoo Cocoon, In The Cage, Back In N.Y.C., Here Comes The Supernatural Anaethetist).<br />Also, there is a narrative in the sleeve by Peter Gabriel, which explains exactly what's going on in each of the songs, so the narrative is essential in getting a slight grasp on the story.<br />If it's a challenge you want, a challenge is what you will get.
B00005R87Q|5.0|I don't know what I was expecting, but I know that what I got was a lot more than I had anticipated. I remember seeing the preview and thinking I'd MAYBE rent it, because it just looked like a cookie-cutter action movie, with low-rent talent. I now wish I had taken the opportunity to see this on the big screen.<BR>What a pleasant surprise of a movie! There was a pretty good story to it, with a few nice little twists to keep your mind occupied. I can't talk too much about the storyline without giving away the twists, but definately has more to offer than just car racing and women. I am someone who needs a good storyline to go with my action, or I get bored. I was NEVER bored watching this film. <BR>One of the reasons I avoided this film was because of the actors in it. JA Rule? Vin Diesel? And quite a few actors that I had never seen, nor did I care to. Going into it, I thought the highlight would be Michelle Rodriguez, who is one of the best young acresses around (see Girlfight for proof). Were there bad performances? A few, yes. But not out of the actors that I was trying to avoid. Alright, JA Rule was nothing special - but he wasn't in the film long enough to matter. Vin Diesel though gave a pretty good performance, and Paul Walker did a very nice job as well. Both of Paul Walker's bosses gave pretty cheesy performances, but you don't see too much of them anyways. <BR>The action in the film is top notch, and the film just looks great. On top of the great film, you do get some great bonuses with the DVD. I rented this, and flipped through the extras.... THREE PAGES, and not much fluff material here! I only had a chance to look at a few things, but what I saw was great! <BR>I highly recomend buying this movie immediately... and that is coming from someone who a week ago had no desire to even see it!
B000001EXR|2.0|I'm old school. I like the original three. I liked Alive! and Destroyer. I started getting uncomfortable during the Hot in the Shade/Unmasked period. This album is heavy on songs written by Gene. You can tell he manufactured the thing from beginning to end. (Not that that's entirely bad, I happened to like his solo album, and &quot;Going Blind&quot; might be my favorite KISS song.) But here he seems to want to capitalize on that Alice in Chains-Soundgarden vibe, and it just ends up coming off so derivative and kinda pathetic. Quite frankly, it's a little Rob Halford-esque. KISS is SOOOOO much better than this. I long for the days of &quot;She's a dancer, a romancer/ I'm a Capricorn and she's a Cancer...&quot;  and &quot;Baby, baby, don't ya hesitate, cuz I just can't wait...&quot;  Humor. Fun. Remember them?

B00005RHGK|5.0|This is definately one of the few horror movies that lived up to my expectations. I first saw it opening day and was mildly entertained, it was good but the theater I saw it had a poor sound system. The movie was still worth the purchase. I just finished watching it on dvd and man, what a difference, the sound track is pulse pounding and the movie made me jump on many occasions, it was almost a completely new experience. please do yourself a favour and pick up this dvd, unless you feel that supporting a child molesting director is wrong.
B00005QZWI|4.0|Excellent music, but audiophiles will definitely notice the distortion in a few tracks where the recording equipment was simply driven too hard. It's only in a couple places, and doesn't detract much to an otherwise excellent score. (The very emotional music at the end of &quot;The Bridge of Khazed Dum&quot; and &quot;The Breaking of the Fellowship&quot; are both especially notable)<br />I can only hope a more complete CD with additional music is released in the future - this CD leaves you wanting more :-)
0671015206|4.0|While this book confirmed what I already believed to be true about people's spending habits. The authors made this book a fun read, especially for those who fit into the PAW category! I like their approach to research and think their results intuitively make sense. I recommend this book, especially to those who spend a lot of money keeping up with the Jones'!
B00005R87Q|1.0|I saw this movie in the theatre. Naturally there were 100's of Honda/Acura and various imports there with their classic low profile tires, euro lights, and oversized exuast tips. All of them thinking they are bad ass speeding through a parking lot that kids were walking in. Just ignorant. I finally got into the movie to find out the plot was the most unrealistic stupid thing I have ever heard of. Like a little coffee can import is going to run a semi off the road and rob him? Give me a break! Just lame, just like the people that drive these cars. All well most import drivers are under the age of 20 and don't know too much about cars other than, &quot;My Integra sure does look neat with my new Acura emblem.&quot;. I think it's been said before but there's no replacement for displacement, and there's always someone out there with something faster. Instead of wasting your money on your expensive wheels, go get an education. As for this DVD, total waste of money, unless you like Saliva or Ja Rule, I am told they have a music videos on here.
0062502182|5.0|&quot;The Alchemist&quot; is one of those few literary works that change the way you look at your goals and direction in life.  It's unbelievable that such a simple little parable can teach us so much about how to get the most out of our lives.  Beware, though, because after reading it, you'll be hard pressed not to throw caution to the wind and chase that seemingly impossible dream of yours.  This is the book that first hooked me on Paulo Coelho, and I've been a fan ever since.
B00000JPYD|5.0|NOTE: only the original tracks are reviewed here.<br />A truly unique record for all time, 'Bridge of Sighs' is perhaps the best non-Zep heavy offering of the period. Although many considered Trower's sound here to be merely Hendrix-esque, it was, and is, unique.<br />1974 was a bit of a no-man's land for hard rock. Zep took a big break, and Cooper's 'Muscle of Love', while great, left a massive opening for Trower and this record. 'Bridge' was THE heavy record of the year. But it was, and is, much more.<br />Completely original tonal dynamics, brilliant songwriting, and letter-perfect musicianship are the hallmarks of this fantastic effort. Every song is, at once, mellow and heavy. This goes not only to outstanding production, but also to perfect conception and execution on the part of  the Trower power trio itself. Rock somehow came of age on this record. It owes nothing to any other band of the time; in that alone, this album is an unqualified success.<br />A disc without 'hits', this album was, nevertheless, the stalwart of AOR DJs during the summer of  '74, and beyond,  and was a surprisingly-smashing commercial success, sold by the millions at stores for approximately $5.00. Go figure.<br />For those seeking the Roots of Rock in the 1970's, buy this one, for sure...<br />'Day of the Eagle' opens the record, and a new time: a time when every great new record destroyed what came before. A real groove, clearly distinct from Zep, Sabbath, and Aerosmith in all ways, this song gets right down to business immediately without pretense, and crushes previously-standard time signatures in deference to a truly new sound. This fact cannot be overstated.<br />With its rolling pull-off start, the title track follows. Nicely-depressing, droning, and slow, the stage is set. If you were stoned, young, and 'there', this was IT. If not, the album may lack some meaning, but it's still awesome. A  tricky fade gives rise to the next, slower than molasses, bluesy track, and all that follows: rare, utter perfection.<br />An awesome A+ collection ensues. This is neither Plant nor Osborne, Page nor Blackmore. Here, Trower shreds through his new sound, but always relinquishes before becoming self-indulgent. Everything flows like the perfect trip. <br />Perhaps the greatest compliment that can be given to this record is the fact that no one of note attempted to copy it. It was, in some critics' eyes, the capstone of a very brief, but incredibly cool time. <br />Trower's original chord choices continue throughout. Bluesy, but not blues, the buzzy set takes control, with heretofore undone syncopation, and the album-wide restatement of the birth of a new phase-shifted sound. Andy Summers, for better or worse, eat your heart out. <br />For you kids, this is a must-have. Everyone else, you've got it, rotting in your basement. Rediscover it on CD.
B00005RHGK|1.0|I don't particularly go for these teenage horror films that have been popping up ever since SCREAM came out. Now don't get me wrong, I like horror films, but my taste lies more in the vicinity of Dario Argento, George Romero, Clive Barker, and Luci Fulci. But I sat down to see JEEPERS CREEPERS with an open heart, and the film started out pretty good. The story goes as follows; The two siblings, Trish and Darry, are on their way home to visir their parents, on a college break, when they are suddenly harassed by an eerie looking old van, whilst driving along a deserted stretch of American highway. It's all very much like THE HITCHER. After a short while the van drives on and dissapears, until Trish and Darry comes across it again, this time parked in front of an abandoned church. As they drive by, they see a person dumping what appears to be bodies wrapped in white sheet into a pipe in the ground. Unfortunetaly, the person also spots Trish and Darry; Another car chase follows. Trish and Darry manages to escape again, but this time Darry gets the brilliant idea that they should backtrack and see if anybody needs help. Valiant, sure, but stupid. &quot;Haven't you watched enough horror movies?&quot; Trish asks Darry, and it's bad luck for Darry that he obviously hasn't, because we all know what Darry doesn't; Never, ever, under any circustance, go back... So far the film is fairly exciting. There's even some pretty nice camera work to behold. But it doesn't take long before the plot pretty much skyrockets off the face of the planet. Now this is okey if you can maintain credibility, but JEEPERS CREEPERS certainly can't. Things become ridiculous, and when stuff gets ridiculous they seize to be scary. I started out thinking that &quot;boy would this be creepy if it happened to me,&quot; and I ended up thinking &quot;what a totally awful film this is,&quot;
B0000B1OE7|5.0|In 17th century fedual Japan, there was a disease that have killed all the people in a village as a masterful ninja named Jubei is hired to investigate the happenings going on. While he is at it, he joins up with a sexy but literally dangerous ninja girl named Kagero and a wise old man to find the mysterious Shogun Of The Dark and his army of demons that want to overthrow the Japanese government. Could his old friend now turned foe named Gemma has came back from the dead? is his past coming back to haunt him?<br /><br />One of the best Japanese animated movies of all time and the best animated movie of the action/fantasy genre. There is some sleaze thrown in with a brief but not too subtle rape scene (Not as bad as Urotsukidoji though) with animated nudity at times and of course graphic animated gore/violence galore such as head slicing and dicing like you've seen in \\"Fist of the North Star\\", this movie is truly director Yoshiaki Kawajirri's finest movie besides Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust and a worthy anime feature. The film is kind of sleazy at times yet even graphic on the violence at times but this movie provides non-stop action you would see in a Hollywood movie and there's amazing sword fight sequences that will blow your mind and the animation is excellent as well. Kagero is quite a tragic woman as she has the unique ability to poison anyone who sleeps with her or makes love with her though she has feelings for the poisoned Juebi as there is a heartbreaking moment that will touch your heart. I also like that this is a love story that is subtle yet not too sappy as this movie is everything that a guy and anime fan needs.<br /><br />This special edition DVD provides both fullscreen and widescreen editions with cool extras like itnerviews with the cast and director, history of Juebi feature, character snyposis and photo galleries, English and Japanese in subtitles versions and trailers to this and other Manga entertainment releases. Now if this was released on Blu-Ray i would love to see it in high-definition.<br /><br />Also recommended: \\"Princess Mononoke\\", \\"Urotsukidoji: Legend of the Overfiend\\", \\"Akira\\", \\"Ghost in The Shell\\", \\"Shogun Assassin\\", \\"Beowulf\\", \\"The Last Samurai\\", \\"Seven Samurai\\", \\"Ran\\", \\"Fist of the North Star (1986)\\", \\"Vampire Hunter D\\", \\"Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust\\", \\"Perfect Blue\\", \\"The Patriot (2000)\\", \\"Braveheart\\", \\"Elektra\\", \\"Ninja Assassin\\", \\"Wicked City\\", \\"Demon City Shinjuki\\" and \\"Kill Bill 1 & 2\\".d love to see it in high-definition.

0380713802|5.0|I was born and raised in Europe, but I grew up in America.  I have since been back to travel thru Europe and Bill Bryson is right on target when he makes hilarious, witty, harsh, and yet exact comments about the way Europeans are.  <br />All the criticism about Neither Here Nor There is coming from people without a sense of humor!  Lighten up!  If you are a traveler, you'll understand where he's coming from.  He talks about the experiences that you think about, and will tell your friends and family after your return home, but his sense of humor and a cocky attitude make such a normal thing, like crossing the street in Paris, an event!  This is a book that makes you laugh out-loud!<br />This is a great book for anyone who traveled thru Europe, or would like to go there. If you have never been to Europe, this book will give an idea of what traveling thru Europe really is like!
0802136834|5.0|Weir is my favorite non-fiction writer.  This is my 2nd favorite of her works, after &quot;The Life of Elizabeth I&quot; (see my review of that work too.)<br />What's best about &quot;Six Wives&quot; is that Weir is in firm control of the elements of the lives of these very different women.  Through telling their stories, Weir gives a coherent history and an excellent account of Henry's reign.<br />This is serious popular history -- and is well researched and accurate.  But Weir's best attribute is her readability.  She makes history a page-turning pageant -- without resorting to overblown or overly romanitic drivel.<br />I've read all her historical works.  I suggest beginning with 'Elizabeth I', then &quot;Children of Henry VIII&quot; followed by this work and then her latest 'Henry VIII: The King and His Court.&quot;  Though she writes of the same period throughout these works, she manages to reveal something new with each -- and is never, ever dull.
B000055ZB8|5.0|That's the question you'll be asking yourself after viewing Max Shreck's performance as the titular character in Nosferatu. A film once nearly lost to us, Nosferatu is perhaps the film that best represents the creepiness and terror of Stoker's Dracula. Murnau successfully utilizes all the tools and techniques at his disposal to create a film thick with atmosphere. What he is unable to do with dialogue, he does with clever special effects and effectively framed shots and sequences.<br />This DVD presentation of the film is very good. It offers two musical soundtracks. The first is a simple organ meant to show how the audience would have experienced the film 80 years ago. The second is a modern orchestral composition that I feel better serves the film. It has a haunting, gothic feel to it that fits the action on-screen like a glove. There is also a commentary track by noted film historian Lokke Heiss. While Heiss is clearly a very learned scholar, he is one dull commentator. Honestly, I have an appreciation of silent film but his droning on without the benefit of a musical backdrop nearly put me to sleep. Heiss also narrates a much shorter featurette on the present-day sites of the film that is a little easier to swallow.<br />I urge you if you are either a film enthusiast or a fan of the horror genre to pick up this well done presentations of one of the best films ever (silent or otherwise).
B00005OWEG|4.0|Francis Ford Coppola has proven his consistancy in producing films that keep the viewer on the edge of their seats. Coppola, although twisted, has one of the best imaginations and styles that has ever occupied the director's chair. This 1979 classic movie shows that Coppola's films are here to stay. He creates characters that are well developed. His imagination contributes to the vividly creative characters he has portrayed in his films. I look forward to many more movies directed by Francis Ford Coppola.
B000002GK1|5.0|This is more like old Black Sabbath than grunge. In fact, the grunge acts didnt even want to be called that. To me, it's more like new punk and heavy metal. Anyway, this is Soundgarden's greatest. Superunknown is great, but this is excellent. Sure, the songs are a bit long, but give them their time. They know how to rock. My drummer writes lyrics and it's kind of like Chris Cornell's lyrics where it makes sense, but then, it doesn't make sense. Outshined is the best. It's in 7/4, and it's very basic. I love their flirtations with odd time signatures. Searching with my Good Eye Closed sounds like 1971-era Sabbath. Chris's singing remindes me of Robert Plant. Very good stuff. Enjoy.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|What can I say but great things come from down under.  This hilarious, saucy take on the world of competitive ballroom dancing has something for everyone.  A great soundtrack,  perfect casting,  and terrific costumes.  Anyone with a competitive spirit will appreciate and fall in love with this film!
B00005V1Y0|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies, and I don't care a whit about ballroom dancing. The film is an off-beat spoof of the truly bizarre sub-culture associated with competitive ballroom dancing in eastern Australia. The central love story of the film is predictable but nonetheless charming, and the dancing chemistry between the two principal characters contrasts sharply with the superficial intimacy of other dancing pairs portrayed. The film is tremendous fun and, yes, loaded with terrific dancing.
B00005R2M3|4.0|Shakira's &quot;Laundry Service&quot; is an amazing album, but there is one problem. It is being marketed to the &quot;TRL/Carson Daly/Teeny Bop&quot; crowd, and it shouldn't be.  &quot;Service&quot; is a rock album, it is not a pop album. So if you are a 14 year old girl who thinks Justin is soooo dreamy, DO NOT buy this album. Save that hard earned allowance and go buy Britney's latest. <br />Now don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to be mean to 14 year old girls or anything, I just don't want them to waste their money.<br />I highly recommend this disc to anyone else. &quot;Eyes Like Yours&quot; is my favorite song of '02. <br />And one more thing, Shakira's thick accent is what makes this album good. Her accent makes her music different than anyone elses. Just imagine if the the Beatles didn't have their accents, or if Shaggy didn't have his. So quit crying and just look up the lyrics in the liner notes.
B00005QDW5|1.0|if you are a true fan than there is one thing that you'll realize. pink floyd's discs are all individual, with all of the songs flowing together to create a beautiful harmony.  putting them together as a best of takes away from the story of each cd, ie dark side, wish you were here, and the final cut, to name a few.  its like reading the cliffs notes on a great story, you only cheat yourself of the experience.
0684867621|4.0|When I started reading this book I thought it was a joke. After all how can you write a 260 page novel out of story of the girl who talks to herself and nature? However it turned out an exiting book and even conversations with her other self seem not only normal, but even exicting. I guess it is important to speak to a smart person once in a while. This story starts, endures and ends in the forest. Basucally very enviromentally consience novel. A girl who gets lost tries to get out of the forest for days and eventually almost feels sorry there are trees still left standing.In the process of making this journey she battles her fears and stupid ideas her other self gives her. Her other self should get another novel to fully unveil itself. It is seem to have much more fun than a girl herself. She tells everything straight to your face without hiding the truth and even jokes with the girl. She even got herself in the swamp and made her to go throught the deadly place.<br />Overall I have to say the book turned a big suprise for me and turned into interesting and exiting even thought it had basically only one physical character.
B00005RHGK|1.0|I was stunned to see that so many people had even given this movie more than one star as I would have opted for 0 stars if given the option. Face it... this is NOT a scary movie... well, it is scary that such horrible films are released... or the stupidity of all the characters in the movie, which boggles the mind. In this movie, in any given situation, the protaganists acts and decides in a manner opposite any human being with more than one brain cell would act. The movie is filled with so many \\"I hear a noise, let me go check it out by myself and if I don't come back, you come look for me, by yourself\\" stupidity.<BR> The ending whereby the protaganist is killed and skinned (no one in the theater was sad to see him go) is so abrupt because you were kind of expecting an attempt to rescue him. Instead, we were greeted by sudden credits. Trust me, there was no other movie where I heard so many people slapping their foreheads in exasperation or laughing at the sheer stupidity of the movie.<BR> This movie was painful, literally painful to watch. After watching the movie (and cursing that I wasted my time and money), I felt nothing but absolute disgust. The only thing more scary than this movie was the rumor that they are making a sequel... ...
B00003CWTH|5.0|Paul Thomas Anderson is a powerful new voice in American cinema.  With BOOGIE NIGHTS, he crafted a story which centered around actors in the porn industry and focused not on their profession, so much as he revolved the narrative around the people themselves. We see them at their best and at their worst. We see them wallow in the depths of sin, and then we watch as they seek redemption. BOOGIE NIGHTS is basically a dramatic retelling of Hebrews 11:24-26, and the message sears your memory and stays there. Paul Thomas Anderson's third feature film, MAGNOLIA, is no different in the uncompromising approach to Biblical themes of epic proportions.    With MAGNOLIA, Paul Thomas Anderson solidifies his stance in Hollywood as a modern Bergman, someone who understands and can accurately capture the human condition on celluloid. As Ingmar Bergman tended to present crises of faith and redemption that reached down to touch the depths of your soul, Anderson does the same thing, and like Bergman, the message comes across technically and artistically through graceful tracking shots, meticulous editing, and powerful performances from a talented ensemble cast.    The film interweaves nine separate storylines that collide with one another by way of coincidence, chance, and divine intervention. It centers on six different characters during the course of one day in San Fernando Valley, California. The interactions between the characters are so intricately woven into the narrative and so complex that an attempt to elaborate in this review would definitely lead to spoilers for those who have yet to see the film.    The characters presented in this film are all going through some sort of personal crisis. Most of them seek redemption throughout the course of the film. Some of them find it. We see them as they struggle to mend torn relationships, find love, and search for acceptance. We see them communicate with God and search for God, until ultimately, God finds them in the most miraculous and spectacular of ways.    This is a film that has the power to either change lives or change the way you perceive the world and those around you.  The strength of the film lies not only in the masterful direction, but in the performances. With a cast that includes Tom Cruise, John C. Reilly, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jason Robards, and Philip Baker Hall, Paul Thomas Anderson achieves the extraordinary. You care for these people. You want to see them succeed. When they do, it is wonderful. When they do not, just as in reality, it is a crushing blow that you feel in your heart.    As for the films controversial finale, it is one of the most memorable moments in the history of cinema - a pure example of the way in which God finds his way into modern cinema. Whether or not this was Anderson's intention is immaterial. It is an inherently personal moment, a different experience for each individual - and the perfect ending to a perfect film.    MAGNOLIA is 189 minutes, and is rated R for pervasive language, drug content, violence, graphic sexual dialogue, and brief sexuality.
B00000J6AG|1.0|The only half decent song on this CD is &quot;South Side,&quot; and probably the only reason that song is half decent is because Gwen Stefani sings most of it. The other songs are just plain horrible. No excitement, no nothing. Listen to more than two minutes of this and expect to be asleep. Moby can't even sing. This CD is pure trash. I'm sorry I ever bought it.
0790729350|1.0|I have owned the director's cut of this on VHS for years and the VHS version is superb visually and the sound is excellent.<br />I bought the DVD so I could have chapter access to each performance. Indeed, the DVD does have that, but it is all for naught.<br />The picture on the DVD is vastly inferior to the VHS. Images that can be clearly seen on the VHS don't register many times at all on the DVD, i.e the outline and some features of a guy dancing are clearly visible on the VHS as they were on film in a theatre. On the DVD, you just see the outine of the figure with a hint of subtler visual attributes. The sound on the DVD is the worst I've heard on any release from a major company. I've seen and heard better on second-rate VHS's and DVD's from the likes of Laserdisc.<br />Boy, will I read those ratings on visual and sound quality from now on. The review on Amazon's \\"technical information\\" for this DVD is absoulutely correct.<br />I will never buy another DVD or VHS from Warner Bros without first renting and previewing it. So I still watch my 2-tape VHS of this landmark film of this one-time phenomenon.<br />The DVD is on one two-sided disc, which doesn't even break at the intermission, to rub salt in this inexcusable mangling from Warner Bros. First, they blew their initial Kubrick set and now this disgrace.<br />If you want this film on video, get in the well-done and tecnically superior VHS double tape. Incompent .... Jack Warner would have kicked who ever is responsible for this rip-off DVD most deservedly in the teeth...
0452282152|4.0|I really enjoyed this slice o' life historical novel.  It's more spare than usual for the genre, which I found refreshing.  Still lots of good detail about this fascinating young woman and the odd social and moral constraints that make up her daily life.  Good painting trivia and a properly enigmantic portrayal of Vermeer and his circle of friends.
B00003CX5P|5.0|I was a kid when the first Star Wars movies were released. I have been a fan of the movies ever since. When the first prequel came out, I had the joy of taking my young daughter to see it. With all the talk of its not being as good as the first three, I was apprehensive. My fears were unfounded. Episode One, &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; is (for right now at least) by far my favorite Star Wars movie.<br />The story begins before the coming of the Empire. The Republic is still around, as are the Jedi and their temple. Looking into the world of Star Wars before the time of Vader and the Emperor was half the joy of this film for me. The viewer is introduced to all kinds of new alien races and creatures. We get to see two new worlds (Naboo and Coruscant).<br />The story centers on a young Obi-Wan (still an apprentice) and his master Qui-Gon Jinn. Together they get involved in a planetary conflict and stumble upon the boy who will one day become Darth Vader.<br />The casting and acting are quite admirable. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are outstanding as Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon. Frank Oz as usual, is awesome as Yoda. While one can see how the guileless Jar Jar might have rubbed some the wrong way in the midst of the cynical last days of the twentieth century, the very concept of a computer generated character opens all kinds of interesting doors. Finally (as far as acting goes), I'd take Natalie Portman over Carrie Fisher any day.<br />The action of the movie is really quite mind blowing stuff. The pod race, the grand battle and the duel between the Jedi and the Sith are all amazing. Ray Park as Darth Maul is particularly impressive.<br />This is a movie that leaves me impatiently awaiting the sequels.<br />Luckily, the DVD has lots of cool stuff to play with while I wait. I cannot believe all the stuff that comes on disc two. Some of the documentaries are movie length themselves. I won't go into all the stuff included (it would take too long), but some of my favorite stuff here is: The &quot;making of&quot; documentary (even though the sound deteriorates towards the end of it), the &quot;tone poem&quot; t.v. spots, the music video for &quot;Duel of the Fates,&quot; The deleted scenes documentary, and the featurettes from the web.<br />There is SO MUCH STUFF here! I give the movie and all the DVD add-ons my highest recommendation. Get it!ff here is: The &quot;making of&quot; documentary (even though the sound deteriorates towards the end of it), the &quot;tone poem&quot; t.v. spots, the music video for &quot;Duel of the Fates,&quot; The deleted scenes documentary, and the featurettes from the web.<br />There is SO MUCH STUFF here!

B00000IQC8|4.0|I had the fortune to see Clerks before I saw any of Kevin Smith's other movies.  The grittiness of this little film would indeed have been murkier had I compared it to its glossier decendants.  Since it was a sketchy, low-budget-type movie, it would understandably be deemed &quot;unrefined&quot; in light of Smith's big-money movies like Dogma. <br />Being twenty-something, I found a lot of the humor was based on pop-culture I was in tune with (there's a a couple of funny dialogues about the Star Wars trilogy, for example). However, those who are averse to vulgar locker-room language should probably skip this one. There's plenty of talk about sex, porn and drugs. Those who aren't thus offended will find good one-liners and witty exchanges.  The acting, I'll admit, was somewhat cheesy.
B000007SPT|5.0|This CD was my introduction to the songs of Tim Buckley and Big Star. Howard Devoto's vocal perfomance on Holocaust is just plain brilliant. Intense and sad.
B000000H5K|3.0|Sepultura's last album with frontman Max Cavalera proved to be a somewhat commercial sucess.  A lot of kids my age who listen to Max's new band Soulfly either think that this is Sepultura's best album or Sepultura's only album.  Well, neither are right.  Sepultura's older material was dark, death metal that got your blood flowing and your head banging.  While &quot;Roots&quot; is heavy, abrasive, and loud, sometimes they sound too much like Korn.  Any longtime Sepultura fan would probably agree with me on that, I recommend Sepultura's older material like &quot;Beneath the Remains&quot; and &quot;Arise&quot; rather than &quot;Roots&quot; or any of Soulfly's stuff, but &quot;Roots&quot; is decent, and was Max's last hurrah with his old band.
B00005AAFS|5.0|Having thoroughly listened to Herzeleid, Sehnsucht, and Live aus Berlin, I can tell you that this is Rammstein's best yet. The guitar riffs and vocals remain consistent and powerful throughout, something they didn't achieve as well in their previous albums, and the overall quality of the music is excellent. <br />One of the biggest differences in this CD is the lyrics. They were &quot;shocking&quot; and &quot;controversial&quot; in Sehnsucht and especially Herzeleid (i.e. weisses fleisch), but seemed pretty toned down in Mutter. Except for Rein Raus that is, which happens to be nasty as hell, but classic Rammstein nonetheless. The lyrics range from the enigmatic (Sonne), the fast paced (Feur Frei), and the bizzare (Zwitter). <BR>This is how I would rank the songs:<BR>1.Sonne<BR>2.Mein Herz Brennt<BR>3.Nebel<BR>4.Adios<BR>5.Spieluhr<BR>6.Ich Will<BR>7.Feur Frei<BR>8.Links 2 3 4<BR>9.Zwitter<BR>10.Mutter<BR>11.Rein Raus<BR>The integration of orchestra and a soprano are something that you wont find in any other rock group, which is unfortunate because it sounds wicked with Till and the 'boys. Only Rammstein could be so innovative. The songs on this CD will be stuck in your head for days, but thats actually a good thing. Overall this disc is worth your money. A good buy for any Rammstein fan.
B00005QZWI|5.0|That would be awesome, ... but it's still just appsolutley amazing!! The dark beauty of the strings, choirs and brass sections are just awesome. The flute soloist on Concering Hobbits is really good. Some pieces on this soundtrack are very light and peaceful sounding, others are very haunting, like the scenes with the Nazgul or the battles. If you hadn't read the books yet, you've got a problem on your hands!
B000050FEN|5.0|Seven takes you on this pyschological thrilling ride throughout the movie. It has you on the edge of your seat ever single time you watch it. <br />Fincher is one of the best director's around with The Game, Fight Club, and Seven. <br />Brad Pitt gives his  best performance ever, as well as Morgan Freeman. <br />I recommend this to everybody out there who wants to enjoy one of the greatest thrillers ever made.
B000002LIM|5.0|If you are a fan of the genius composer Danny Elfman, then you will undoubtedly love this truly amazing gothic, dark, mysterious and sometimes humerous score.<BR> This is Dannys best score in my opinion and the Batman &quot;Theme&quot; truly encaptulates the true meaning and style of Batman which is Gothism only ever being achieved by the amazing director Tim Burton. This is a must have for any film music fan and im sure after listening, you will have more of his soundtracks on your shelf in years to come. Also see: &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; &quot;Bettlejuice&quot; &quot;Batman Returns&quot; and &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;
6300163423|4.0|Director Alan Parker said once he wanted to work in every genre of film before he died. He might as well have retired after making \\"Angel Heart\\" because the movie exists simultaneously as film noir, a 50s pulp detective story, a horror movie, and a supernatural thriller. Mickey Rourke is outstanding as Harry Angel, a down-on-his-luck (is there any other kind?) private eye in post-WWII New York who gets hired by a sinister and enigmatic \\"businessman\\" named Louis Cyphere (Robert DeNiro, looking almost exactly like his favorite director, Martin Scorsese). Cyphere wants Angel to track down a crooner named Johnny Favorite who owes Cyphere....something. Angel goes from New York to New Orleans on his quest for the missing Johnny Favorite, and on the way becomes progressively more unwashed, unshaven, bleary-eyed, sweaty, beaten up, and desperate as his seemingly routine mission uncovers a hidden world or voodoo, murder, and identity theft. Rourke never had a better performance in his Hollywood career than his turn as the fallen Angel, though he was largely stereotyped after this film to play only scumbags or sex freaks, so maybe it wasn't worth it....we all lost a fine actor....anyway the cast is excellent all around, particularly Lisa Bonet, who should have stayed in feature films but like Rourke took more flack for her intensely explicit sweat-and-blood love scene with Rourke than she got praise for her performance as Epiphany, Angel's sex-interest. \\"Angel Heart\\" is an absolute must for fans of detective fiction, horror and most especially, film noir -- Parker does a superb job of creating not only the time period, but a brooding, stylish atmospehre. The flick took a major beating from some critics for being too ugly, too dark, too shocking, too sexual and too disturbing, but I think they miss the point. It's suppposed to be, and it is. Highly recommended.
B00005QW5X|1.0|Did I see the same film as the rest of the reviewers? This is overblown tripe without even the saving grace of decent music. You don't care about any of the characters, and the only positive feeling I experienced in the whole movie was a warm sense of satisfaction when it finally finished. <br />Mitchell beats you over the head with trite metaphors until your ears bleed - just count how many times Hedwig says he was born in a divided city!<br />If this is the rebirth of the musical, God help us. Give me Busby Berkeley and &quot;Singing in the Rain&quot; any day.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This is one of the most confusing and twisted movies that I have ever seen.  I hated it at first, but once I was through watching it and started thinking about everything that I had just seen (and took some aspirin for the headache it gave me) I started to understand and enjoy it.  I have now watched it several times and each time I see it I discover something new that I had not seen or noticed before.  It is truly an awesome movie that will keep you guessing long after you have turned it off.  Plus, all of the acting in it is fantastic.  Plan on spending an entire night watching and rewatching this one.  Enjoy!!!!  (get that bottle of aspirin out!!!!)
B00005R87Q|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST ACTUALLY THEY REALLY CATCH THE ACTION OF WHAT THESE CARS CAN DO. I LOVE THE BEGINNING WHEN THEY HAVE THE FIRST HUGE STREET RACE. SURPRISINGLY THIS MOVIE IS UNDERRATED AND I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY ITS EXCITING JUST TO SEE THE CARS TOP OUT AND THEN THEY HIT THE NOS (NITRIOUS OXIDE) I CANT UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE ARE GIVING ALL THIS FALSE CRITICIZM ITS A GREAT MOVIE THAT I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD OWN.
B00005RHGK|3.0|Let me apologize first by stating that I am one of those people that wants there to be resolution at the end of a movie.  I want to know what the hell is going on and why.  There is one exception to that and that would be Blair Witch Project.  Unfortunately, this movie does not supply me with any useful information about what and why everything is happening.  I also want a movie to deliver when it claims to have the scariest opening sequence and the gutsiest ending.  This movie does not deliver on either one of those claims.  If simply leaving the movie unfinished and open at the end is gutsy, then I say NO to gutsy endings.  And if a movie does not have an opening sequence scarier than Scream or doesnt even come close, then dont make the claim that it is the scariest.  On the other hand, this movie had so much promise, it did have me scared, it did have me nervous and on the edge of my seat.  That is until the ending came.  I was so furious and angry that it made me hate the movie.  Also, there was really nothing that frightening about the monster.  If they wanted to leave something to the imagination, they should have let us imagine him.  My own image would have been far more frightening than him/it or whatever it is.  And what the hell is it anyway?  Not knowing what it is or what and why it is doing evil things does not scare me, it only aggravates me and ticks me off.  Loose ends just dont work and only make it seem that the person directing or producing is just sequel hungry.  Ugh!!!!!  Well, that's what I think and feel about this movie that had such promise and no delivery of the goods that we so desperately seek in horror/scary movies.  But I guess once one has seen Scream, all others pale in comparison.  Scream is a hard act to follow and I am sure everyone knows this.<br />Thanks for taking the time to read my ranting and raving.
0345440757|5.0|I think this is an awesome book and a &quot;must-read&quot; for any expecting and/or new parent.  It helped me to regain my sanity which I thought I was losing by the time my son was 3 months old.   I think I would have had a much easier time with his newborn infancy had I read this book before delivery.  It gives such practical information and tips on everything!<BR>However, despite what many other reviewers have said about this book &quot;not working&quot; unless you use it from day one, that is simply not true!<BR>Another new mom recommended this book to me, as she had used it with her son from the time he was 2 months old.  I had also met two other new mothers who had read the book and successfully used  the author's methods with their babies.  I haven't met anyone who has read this book and not liked it and/or has not had success with it.  <BR>We didn't start using her methods, including the EASY routine, until our baby was three months old.  Up until that time, he had been sleeping with us in our bed.  He would not sleep in his bassinett.  Every time we put him down in there, he would wake up.  When I tried using his crib, the results weren't much better.  I was at my wit's end trying to get him to sleep.  My husband wanted to let the baby &quot;cry it out&quot;, as (in my opinion) so many inhumane parents do with their newborns.  This book gave us a method which we both agreed upon.<BR>Granted, it did take a lot of persistence to incorporate the EASY routine, but within a few days, he had learned to go to sleep on his own at night without even fussing or any anxiety.  It did take much longer - probably about 3 weeks total - for him to learn to go to sleep on his own at naptime.  However, we never let him &quot;cry it out&quot; like so many mothers do.  Every time he cried, just as Tracy Hogg advises in the book, we picked him up until he was calm.<BR>I do think it would have been much easier to follow Ms. Hogg's methods right from the start, and that's what Iintend to do with my next baby.<BR>It just goes to show that IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO LET YOUR BABY CRY IT OUT!!!<BR>I highly recommend this book to anyone who agrees with the author's &quot;middle of the road&quot; approach:  no co-sleeping, and no &quot;crying it out&quot;.
0385505833|3.0|While this book will never be considered  a masterpiece of American Literature, it is well written and fun to read.  A perfect choice for one of those lazy post-Christmas afternoons.
0316779237|4.0|I'm a bit of a scrooge anyway, so these stories were the perfect December read for me, with their odd combination of cynicism and holiday spirit.  Like Sedaris' other work, these stories are often laugh-out-loud funny, so read with caution and be prepared to share bits with whoever happens to be sitting nearby, because Sedaris' writing is too big and bold to just lie there passively on the page.  Enjoy!
B000055Y0X|5.0|First, it's Kubrick and it's a dark comedy.  <BR>Secondly, it is black and white.<BR>C, if you know nothing about the cold war, it may be a complete waste of your time.<BR>If you do not like any of the above points, then forget about this movie.<br />If you are still reading, then you either know as I do that this is one of the funniest film ever made, or you need to purchase it immediately to remind yourself of this fact.  <br />Outside of having a terrific sense of timing for drama, comedy, horror, dialogue, cinematography, Kubrick was able to create a dark comedy about a real US mentality that significantly defined the second half of the 20th century.  <br />If you are under 30 and have not been exposed to the issues based aroung the cold war, this may seem an absolute waste of time.<br />This is a must for any DVD library.  It can be watched over and over again.
0316776963|4.0|Enough has been said about this book that I don't really need to tell you I laughed out loud constantly, or that Sedaris has mastered that rare feat of being funny AND literary all in the same book.  My only regret is that I didn't get this on audiotape so I could hear him reading these himself... Sedaris' own voice lends a unique dimension to all his stories.  Looking forward to experiencing more great stuff from him!
B00002MZ2C|5.0|It is hard to describe &quot;Battle of Los Angeles&quot;,  it is such an intense collection of music showing a band at thier apex that I have a hard time describing it. Every band member is in full force here from the pounding drums, to the surging bass, to the most phenomenal guitar work ever by Tom Morello to the fire spitting vocal's of Zach De la Rocha. Every song has a certain intensity to it, each different. My personal favorites are &quot;Guerilla Radio&quot;, &quot;Testify&quot;, &quot;Mic Check&quot;, &quot;Sleep Now in the Fire&quot;, &quot;Born as Ghosts&quot;, and &quot;Maria&quot;. The Giutar on &quot;Mic Check&quot; and &quot;Maria&quot; is as amzing as anything I have heard before the sounds that it makes are amazing, Tom Morello truly is the best guitarist there is. This album has to be heard so pick it up immediatly.
0780020685|3.0|I bought this DVD with the idea that The Criterion Collection produces very high quality DVDs. Though I understand this is an old film, I was very surprised to find that the quality of the print was inferior to the DVD of the same film published in the UK by the British Film Institute (available on amazon's UK site). The UK release was transferred from a new and seemingly flawless print of the film. Perhaps this Criterion edition was from an older print - at least there were regular artifacts all over the screen, and in most of the brighter shots, for example where a lot of sky is visible, the picture pulsates. This is a familiar sight to anyone who watches old movies, but I was surprised to find it on this DVD, especially considering the perfect picture of the BFI release, which is so good that it looks like the film was shot yesterday. I also found the commentary was a little bit of a let-down. I found there was too much only slightly interesting trivia, and not enough analysis. That being said, the commentary on the UK DVD was completely worthless. <br />...
B00003CXS4|5.0|This movie is one of the best I've seen in a long time. The story and the directing was amazing. The cast and characters are what makes you fall in love with this movie. Brad Pitt's &quot;Piker&quot; is well acted and makes you laugh at his gritty-ness and his manner of speaking which is completely understandable. Benecio Del Toro as a small part, but he is important to the story. Ilike how every time they tell him not to gamble, it shows him with a cigar and cards and Elvis singin Viva Las Vegas. Tommy is just the goofy side-kick. But my favorite person in the movie would have to be Boris &quot;The Bullet Dodger.&quot; Why do they call him the bullet dodger? Because he dodges bullets.
B00005B3Z6|4.0|I first bought this British version because it was available in my local DVD store.  I really enjoyed it, and appreciated the producers breaking ground and presenting this type of show as a TV series.<BR>Then I bought the American version through Amazon, and am totally blown away by it.  The acting in the UK version is okay, but in the US version is much superior.   The characters are more attractive, and I think their personalities are better developed.  The sex is much more explicit.  It's better all the way around.  You've gotta buy the US version - you won't regret it!!!
0441003257|5.0|Excellent!  Fabulous!  A little Sinful...  This book may not be for everyone, but for those who don't take life too seriously, dig right in!  Here good vs. evil is just another day at the office, and the end of the world is just around the corner.  This book is entertaining, witty, and intellectually stimulating.  Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett play incredibly well off of one another, as do the agents of good and evil in this tale.  Highly recommended!
B00005RYQO|5.0|Someone tolde me I wouldn't like this movie cuz I'm a girl. I think he needs to find his brain.<br />This movie is about a cop  Brian, (Paul Walker) who works for the FBI, who is trying to bust a robbery ring. The FBI suspects the elite street racing gang of the robberies. So Brian gets sent undercover to the streets of downtown L.A. as the new street racer.The problem is getting into the gang, you have to win a race against the best of the best Of course he's not gonna win even if his car did cost $15,000. and on top of that the gang doesn't like him very much on the account of getting caught flirting with the gang leaders sister Mia (Jordanna Brewster), But luckly after the gang leader Dom (Vin Diesel) meets Brian (and after they both get shot at by a rival gang) he decides he likes Brian so he's in. Gradually Brian becomes more and more sure that this gang is not responsible and after a date with Mia he's almost positive that it's someone else. The problem? he's wrong. But he doesn't know if he can face turning in Dom who he has become very good friends with. On top of that he finds out that Dom has been in jail once already  and he'd rather die than go back. Now Brian must choose. Turn in the best friend he's ever known, leave Mia and the gang behind with out a backward glance and get his promotion to FBI detective. Or let Dom go, Say goodbye to Mia,go back to the police station as a cop and kiss goodbye to his dreams of being a  FBI detective. <br />Filled with action,suspense,fast cars,hot guys, and a little romance this is the film of the summer. Forget the one with the little blonde lawyer. SEE THIS MOVIE!!! buy it,rent it,barrow it,steal it,watch it. but whatever you do DON'T miss it!!<br />It is a little unrealistic, I mean I live in L.A and its crawling with cops and traffic even at 3:00 A.M. There is no way that they would be able to race down a public street without getting arrested or getting in an accident.
6302491940|3.0|A must see for Noel Coward's prison queen and some terrific car stunts. That's about it.  But hey...it's fun and relatively cheap.
B00003CXTG|3.0|This film wasn't actually about Pearl Harbor but about a love story centering around flat characters that I didn't care about. Cuba Gooding Jr. didn't get much more than five minutes onscreen which was somewhat of a letdown. However, I must say that the actual attack was spectacularly well created.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is an amazing piece of work.<br />Fatboy Slim's editing of the dance numbers is worth the price of the rest of the film. Even Kidman's detractors must admit, she does a great job. Ewen MacGregor is just delightful.  Baz 's handling of the musical elements is just unlike anything anyone else is doing on the planet.<br />I dislike Kidman a lot and I am buying this one.
B00003CXN4|3.0|While the shaky editing of &quot;Traffic&quot; took some time to get used to, I nevertheless enjoyed this movie.  Most of the stories being told within the film are interesting and the cast was superb.  Benicio Del Toro deserved his Oscar and Don Cheadle and Luiz Guzman were hilarious as DEA agents. While &quot;Traffic&quot; can get boring at times, it still lingers in memory.
B00003CXB7|4.0|I'm so glad 20th Century Fox has finally released MASH on DVD! The Movie itself is excellent, the restoration makes the film clearer than I ever remeber seeing it and the sound is top notch! (It really enhances Robert Altman's use of overlapping dialouge.) But the reason I gave it four stars instead five is the director's commentary; Boy what a hypocrite!! sure he directed this hugely successful movie, and the commentary has alot of interesting facts. But what bothered me the most was his bashing of the TV Series. (I'm a fan of both) in the commentary he never mentions the series by it's name or as the TV series, only as &quot;That Show&quot; and you can tell he hates it. later on he tells you why, He feels the show was extremely racist. I scratched my head wondering how he could say that when the film has many slurs itself. anyway thats my only compliant with the DVD set. If you want to watch a great film, and see what the TV series was based on definitly grab a martini and buy this DVD!!
6300213749|5.0|This 1982 buddy/cop classic launched Eddie Murphy's career in the movies. Nick Nolte does a fine turn as a brutal and racist cop but Murphy upstages him and steals every scene he is in. The two have great chemistry.
0062502182|5.0|This book doesn't aim to tell you what to do to be happy. It merely points out that happiness is just a step away and that you can achieve if you set your mind to it, because when you really want something, the whole universe conspires so you can have it. It didn't make me start a journey, it didn't change my life, but it is a reassurance to me of how much you can accomplish, and a &quot;read again in case of emergency&quot; type of book for those moments when life puts you down. I'll keep it close always and will surely tell everyone I know about it.
6302787068|5.0|This is Disney during its peak in producing animated films. Robin Williams and Gilbert Gottfried are absolute scene-stealers.
0871137380|5.0|Yes Black Hawk Down is a great book.  For serious readers who want to hear the soldiers in their own words there is a video available.  I hope Amazon will allow me to let readers know that here is a great resource to go along with the book.   <BR>As always the award winning documentary series &quot;Frontline&quot; is ahead of Hollywood (with all apologies to Mr. Ridley Scott).<BR>I urge all readers interested in this account of our involvement in Somalia to go to the PBS web site and search for the &quot;Frontline&quot; video entitled &quot;Ambush In Mogadishu&quot;.  This is a riveting account of the Somalia incident. I would advise buying and watching the &quot;Frontline&quot; video before paying to see the movie.  Every American should watch this video and hear the soldiers in their own words.  This video is of the same quality as the award winning series &quot;Vietnam: A Television History&quot;.<br />* Check your local library, they may already have a copy of the PBS video available.
B00000G3PL|5.0|The &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; series is one of the most explosively entertaining action series ever, and not just because of the explosions and stunts, but more importantly the chemistry of the entire cast. Mel Gibson and Danny GLover were meant to work with each other. Their chemistry is just rare. Joe Pesci and Chris Rock are hilarious, Rene Russo makes a formidable love interest for Gibson, and Jet Li is one of the most electrifying villains on the screen, period. Enjoy the ride.
B00003CXS4|4.0|this is such a fast-paced movie with so many over-the-top characters that you can't help but pay attention the whole way through.  the dvd even has an option for special subtitles that only appear when brad pitt's character mickey is speaking, how funny is that?  bottom line: cool story, cool music, cool characters, and a cool dog...what else do you need in a movie?
0385505833|4.0|This is my first Grisham book, and I liked it quite alot.  I found it to be quite funny, much of it just in the subtleties of the neighbors' conversations.<br />My main problem with the book was the way they completely abandoned their cruise plans when Blair decided to come home early with practically no warning, and even lied to her about it.  It reminded me of the much overused sitcom plot where the story basis is a lie grown out of control.<br />But the ending and the message I got from the story left me feeling good.
B000002J1O|5.0|As far as vintage PG-era Genesis goes, this is about as good as it gets (depending on what your opinions are on _Lamb_).  In terms of musicianship and band unity, I don't think the members of Genesis were ever tighter and more prominently on display than on this masterpiece.  The first two songs pack quite a punch - &quot;Dancing With The Moonlit Knight&quot; starts out with a gentle beginning, before launching out into an all-out assault.  Hackett is all over the place on this track, and you'll hear his mastery of polyphonic technique here YEARS ahead of Halen.  The song fades beautifully into brooding mystery. The eerie and whimsical &quot;I Know What I Like&quot; rears up next, posessing a great, propulsive, almost funky sitar-led riff at its heart.  More traditional prog-rock territory is covered on &quot;Firth of Fifth&quot;.  Here is found Steve Hackett's greatest moment on guitar as a member of Genesis, highlighted by a long, majestic, legato solo which rides Tony Banks' swelling synths like a sandpiper on the crest of a wave.  &quot;More Fool Me&quot; marks the very beginning of Phil's long and disheartening journey into the heart of Adult Contemporary music, however his balladeering here is more minstrel-like, innocent and welcome in the context of the album.  (He took a similar pastoral turn on Anthony Phillips' solo album _The Geese And The Ghost_.)  Again on the jaunty &quot;Battle of Epping Forest&quot; Genesis choose to display their whimsy - no band ever packed a song with as many sly winks as this band did, seemingly satirizing modern gangland warfare by comparing it to medieval warfare.   Peter puts several of his different voices on display here, continuing the tradition of musical theater.  After the fine &quot;After The Ordeal&quot; there's another &quot;Suppers Ready&quot;-like exercise, &quot;The Cinema Show.&quot;  Like &quot;Supper&quot; many elements of Greek mythological imagery are synthesized and contrasted with modern elements - the two-song cycle ends with &quot;Aisle Of Plenty&quot;, a musical shopping list.<br />I like what another reviewer pointed out with regards to the satirical and modern societal elements of Gabriel's lyricism and its parallels to contemporary British events. Im not sure that the parallels and critiques of modern society are as prominently on display as well as they are on _Lamb Lies Down On Broadway_, but there is something to be scryed here between the rubric formed by PG's scattershot mythological imagery and Shakespearean references.  &quot;Cinema Show&quot; and &quot;Battle Of Epping Forest&quot; hold especially well up to such lyrical scrutiny.  <br />John Burns' note-perfect production, while reaching an early zenith with the fantastic and bubbling &quot;I Know What I Like&quot;, is a bit too sterile for my tastes towards the end of the album.  This album also features, IMHO, some of Genesis' more meandering instrumental indulgences.  Production quibbles aside, there's no denying Hackett's performance is masterful and this is a mandatory purchase for any fan of Genesis.  I think a lot of fans of their later poppier years would do well to start with this one before tackling _Lamb_ or _Foxtrot_.  The new edition features both remastered sound as well as song lyrics.
B00005JKQX|5.0|Having only seen the previews for A Beautiful Mind before seeing the film, I was nothing short of stunned when I left the theater. Stunned that a book absent from the public eye focusing on a brilliant man, A Beautiful Mind could be brought to the screen only with a cinematic and heartfelt commitment. Impressed that Russell Crowe, who is quickly becoming one of the best actors of all time, could portray a man so full of cerebral electricity that he himself became John Nash in a sense. And certainly I was left breathless that Ron Howard could return filmmaking to its basic roots, telling a story without lots of flash and special effects. A Beautiful Mind moved me perhaps more than any film in most of my life. To delve deep into the troubled yet passionate mind of John Nash through Crowe's eyes is an inspiration of life itself. I dare say that this film will sweep the Oscars, and even if it doesn't, it garners the honor of being a classic for all ages.
0451527712|5.0|Set in remote European landscapes, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein transports her readers into a gothic tale of sympathetic characters driven by success, revenge, acceptance, and grief. A great book to have on a snow day with hot tea and a cozy blanket.
B000002LCU|4.0|I can't believe no one has reviewed this album yet.  <br />If you are at all interested in George's solo work, you MUST give this album a listen and make up your own mind.  The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is beacuse I admit my bias and I wouldn't want to oversell the album to someone who is just starting to listen to Harrison's solo work for the first time.<br />Got My Mind Set On You and When We Was Fab were the two hits from the album.  This Is Love was also released as a single.  Other strong cuts include Cloud 9, If That's What It Takes, Devil's Radio, and Wreck of the Hesperas (sp?).  There really isn't a bad song on the album.  If and when they re-issue it, I hope they include Lay His Head (b side of Got My Mind Set On You) as a bonus track.

Better yet see the movie if possible.
B0000009OP|4.0|The complexity of this album juxtaposed with a very straightforward sound is overwhelming at times.  I recommend this album quite highly to practically everyone I know.
B00005RYKU|2.0|I was hooked on the trailer, and I was looking forward to seeing this movie.  Unfortunately, the best part of the film WAS the trailer.  My problem with the movie was the convenient moments of incredibly nonsensical behavior.  Just when a bit of tension was building, our heroine fails us.  I watched the movie with a group of 12 friends, and we all were shouting at the film at the same times.  &quot;Duh... call the police!&quot; &quot;Um, could you be any more obvious?&quot;  By the latter part of the film, we were all cheering the bad guys on.  Our reason?  &quot;Anyone doing things that stupid deserves to get whacked.&quot;<br />Bottom line - Revved the engines but failed to engage the gears.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Aside from the rather liberal historical modifications, I think Ridley Scott did a smashing job with this film.  Definitely in leagues with other &quot;masterpieces&quot; such as Blade Runner and Alien.
B00005JKT8|3.0|I saw this movie with my sister, since we both love romantic comedys.  It isn't one of Meg Ryans best but we both really enjoyed Hugh Jackman's acting and character.  The movie in general is &quot;cute&quot; and we were left thinking, &quot;why aren't men more like Leopold?&quot; Meg's brother and her ex-boyfriend also did a fabulous job on their characters - I just wish Meg Ryan would have been more enthusiastic as she has been in other films.  I would recommend it as a fun, I-feel-like-laughing film.
B00005OWEG|5.0|Not all re-releases with extra footage are worthwhile.  This one is imho.  I enjoyed all the extra detail.  It's one of those chances to see more of an already awesome classic that you probably don't want to miss.  One caveat: If you didn't honestly like the original version - i.e., the emotional tug-of-war between the real and surreal, which from what I've read is a pretty darn accurate portrayal of the historical event for many - then you probably won't enjoy the added footage.  I most certainly did!
B000001ESF|5.0|Let me start with the line - &quot;This is a great album&quot;... Well not as great as Moving Pictures may be. Actually I have only 2 of Rush's album. 2112 and MP. 1st buy was MP in May, 2001. I was very impressed and was looking for Permanent waves since then in the music shops out here in India. Alas, I found every single Rush album but not PW. I gave up and bought my next target &quot;2112&quot; and I am haapy with the quality. Yup Rush is GREAT. I really do think they deserve much more attention than they have got and this (their 4th album) album virtually started it all for them.<BR>Title track is obviously great, has its high, has its low. sometimes accoustic, sometimes electric and moderately sound effect driven. I do agree with everybody. It's great. Time goes so fast while listening to this track.<BR>But I can't agree with people who says the rest are fillers. I find  great songs. Specially &quot;Tears&quot;, how can it be a filler? It's so nice. &quot;Something for nothing&quot; is also a good rocker, but so is &quot;A passage to Bangkok&quot;. Even &quot;A twilight zone&quot; and &quot;lesson&quot; are good. So where is the filler??? I could not find one.<BR>Anyway opinions differ and moreover I am new to rush and yet to find more of this exciting band.<BR>If somebody's waiting for my opinion about buying this album. Please don't wait for year 2112 to come. I say don't wait for even 2112 second. RUSH to Buy this album now. (While I go searching for PW, and if still not found, going for Signals/ A farewell to Kings/ Hemisphere. Any suggestions???
B00000IIXH|4.0|Bruce was already a local hero when I first heard some of these songs as a teenager in the Philadelphia area in '73. If your memories of Springsteen go back that far, or even if you're a relatively recent fan of his music (and the E Street Band), then this is a very good CD to add to your collection. <br />To me, it's worth the purchase just to get clean copies of The Fever and The Promise.  And Trouble River is an EXCELLENT rocker (regardless of what the other reviewer says).<br />I couldn't bring myself to buy the long box set. These 18 tracks were enough to satisfy my appetite for songs that couldn't fit onto other albums, either due to timing, contractual, or artistic issues.  Not all of the 18 are my favorites, but on balance, this is a really fun CD to listen to if you're a Sprinsteen fan. Definitely recommended.

B00004TDRD|5.0|In the pantheon of all-time great horror and suspense films, JAWS is not merely a quarter-billion dollar box office blockbuster, but excellent cinema to boot.  From a popular novel by Peter Benchley, this quickly became a legendary film--and it's not hard to see why.  With Steven Spielberg as director, and a trio of leading men who give high-caliber performances, it's no wonder that this remains one of the top movies of its kind.<br />The film's plot is well known: Amity Island is beset by a series of attacks carried out by a mysterious Great White shark, and the powers-that-be don't want to cause a panic and destroy the summer tourism season.  Roy Scheider is Amity's police chief Martin Brody, whose calls to temporarily shut down the beaches until the shark can be killed are thwarted by a mayor (Murray Hamilton) and a town council more concerned with making bucks than saving people's lives.  Richard Dreyfuss is the shark expert who confirms the presence of a Great White in the local waters.  Robert Shaw is Quint, the local fisherman who is half-crazy from the start and just itching to have his own Moby Dick-like showdown.<br />When the shark causes a total panic on the beach on the 4th of July, it is up to these three men to hunt down the elusive fish.  But once out on the open water, these three hunters also become the hunted; at one point, the shark jumps out from the water, and frightens Scheider so much that he tells Shaw, famously: &quot;You're gonna need a bigger boat.&quot;<br />After taking an endless pounding from the shark, Shaw's boat the &quot;Orca&quot; begins to flounder.  Shaw is eventually eaten whole by the shark, and Dreyfuss is temporarily lost under water.  It is up to Scheider, a man with a severe case of hydrophobia, to kill the shark.  He shoves a scuba tank into the fish's mouth, aims, fires, and blows the shark into a million pieces.<br />The making of JAWS was extremely arduous and difficult.  Spielberg was faced day after day with problems involving the mechanical shark that was used on location; the thing refused to function properly half the time.  The budget and schedule swelled to the point that Spielberg almost got fired.  Ironically, even though the shark was to be seen throughout the film, because of the technical problems, Spielberg resorted to the tried-and-true method of mere suggestion.<br />This turned out to be the smartest thing.  Now JAWS was no longer a standard-issue monster movie.  Like Spielberg's 1971 suspense masterpiece DUEL, it was now very much in the tradition of Alfred Hitchcock, specifically the Master's 1963 film THE BIRDS.  Spielberg's use of Hitchcock's suspense-building techniques, combined with the fine performances of Scheider, Shaw, and Dreyfyss, helped to drive JAWS to the top of the box office charts and onto three Oscar wins: editing, sound, and John Williams' now-legendary, cello-driven score.<br />Although followed by three vastly inferior sequels and a lot of lousy imitations, JAWS has lost none of its gut-grabbing power.  It is essential viewing to this very day, especially for horror and suspense film buffs.
0767903862|5.0|Bill Bryson is not so much a travel writer as a teller of shaggy dog stories. He has travelled to Australia a number of times and this is the recounting of adventures that he had on one longer trip where he rented a car and drove huge distances around the country. <br />Each place he visits gives rise to a story. Thus he visits a small pub in the Norther Territory which used to be a stop of air strip in times when planes had shorter ranges than they do now. He gives a description of the &quot;town&quot; and some background and then recounts the exploits that he had staying there. The device he uses is to describe waking up and having a coffee with his travel companion. Both are hung over from a solid night on the booze and they work out what has happened by looking at the items they have in their pockets. As they do so the memories of a rightous and funny night come back. <br />One of the other great stories in the book are the description of listening to five days cricket commentary when Bryson is completely unaware of the rules of the game. His attempts to work out what is happening from the jargonised language of the broadcast is a classic. <br />The only slightly strange thing in this book is Bryson's gentleness in talking about Australia. He can be a little more biting but in this book he is rather complementary.
B000000W5F|5.0|While not quite up to the mammoth standards of Exile or Sticky Fingers, Tattoo You marks a rather glorious conclusion to the Stones' contribution to rock 'n roll history. It was all downhill after this one, and so the promising return to roots showcased on Tattoo You proved to be, ultimately, a false dawn, but what a dawn it was. The album is not just remarkable for its revival of the muscular rock anthems the band delivered so plentiously in their prime, but also in its occasional but brilliant departure from the Brown Sugar days. &quot;Start Me Up's&quot; instantly familiar riff launches the album into a series of similarly gritty and great rock tunes, particularly the epic &quot;Slave,&quot; on which Keith's raunchy guitar explodes melodically for nearly 8 minutes, and a lip-smacking 8 minutes it is. &quot;Limousine&quot; is classic Stones blues, replete with every element of great blues-rock; the shrieking harmonica, rollicking blues guitar licks ala Chuck Berry, Jagger's confident drawl, it's all there, and it's one of the greatest blues songs of the Rolling Stones oeuvre, up there with &quot;Parachute Woman,&quot; &quot;Midnight Rambler&quot; or &quot;Love in Vain.&quot; A few tracks here--&quot;Hang Fire,&quot; &quot;T&amp;A,&quot; and especially &quot;Neighbors,&quot; foreshadow the uninspired noise the band favored on later 80's records. &quot;T&amp;A,&quot; at least, offers some delicious drumming and the tongue-in-cheek vulgarity that characterizes the Jagger/Richards songwriting style, but &quot;Neighbors&quot; is just noise, absent of melody and full of empty rage, and &quot;Hang Fire&quot; is just plain rock filler. The unfortunate part of legend status is that everyone knows when you're underachieving, and the Stones certainly know they can do better than &quot;Neighbors,&quot; but, as happens with most artists who end up putting out four decades worth of albums, they just don't have the energy to care. As I mentioned, though, the album is catapulted onto top ten Stones albums lists when it wanes gracefully to its sweet conclusion with ballads such as the ethereal &quot;Heaven,&quot; &quot;Aint No Use in Cryin',&quot; and the chart hit, &quot;Waiting on a Friend.&quot; Whereas previous (and later) departures from their rock roots were abysmal failures--the disco-tinged &quot;Emotional Rescue&quot; and the Regae disaster, &quot;Black 'N Blue&quot;--these unusually atmospheric, heartfelt and hypnotizing tunes tactfully expanded the Stones' musical vision. &quot;Heaven,&quot; in particular, bloated with grace, beauty and authenticity, might be the most successful Stones &quot;experiment&quot; of all. These ballads, along with above-mentioned rock classics, make Tattoo You an essential purchase for even the most casual Rolling Stones fan.onto top ten Stones albums lists when it wanes gracefully to its sweet conclusion with ballads such as the ethereal &quot;Heaven,&quot; &quot;Aint No Use in Cryin',&quot; and the chart hit, &quot;Waiting on a Friend.&quot; Whereas previous (and later) departures from their rock roots were abysmal failures--the disco-tinged &quot;Emotional Rescue&quot; and the Regae disaster, &quot;Black 'N Blue&quot;--these unusually atmospheric, heartfelt and hypnotizing tunes tactfully expanded the Stones' musical vision. &quot;Heaven,&quot; in particular, bloated with grace, beauty and authenticity, might be the most successful Stones &quot;experiment&quot; of all.

B000002KET|5.0|This is the Black Sabbath album that will prove to ANYONE wholistens to it, that Sabbath were real artists. The music is a complex steamroller that chews you up and regurgitates you like the chopped liver that you really are. Throw away your Metallica and Megadeth and get this. Before Ozzy became the cheez wiz master of 80's hair metal, he was a poet, a prophet, and a philosopher. This album is proof...
B000002MY3|5.0|This is the best CD I have listened to in a VERY long time.  If you're into alternative rock, and you're sick and tired of bubblegum pop (ahem...no names mentioned), and you don't have this already (WHERE THE F**K HAVE U BEEN??), you should definitely buy this.  JLP sold 28 million copies and went 16x platinum for a very good reason - it is legendary. This CD deserves to be in your collection. Here is the track by track breakdown:<br />running time - 57:31<br />1. all i really want (4:44) - ***** VERY very good.  When I first heard this I immediately fell in love with it.<br />2. you oughta know (4:09) - ********************+ this is THE song (if you know what i mean).  this song (among others) made it for alanis.  it is about a girl getting back at a lover for cheating her.  Absolutely classic (in the video she looks like a angry monster).<br />3. perfect (3:07) - ******* This song is my life. It's about how parents love their children but only if they are perfect. It's from the parents' point of view (it's sarcastic).<br />4. hand in pocket (3:41)- ***** When Im down and depressed, I put on this song. It always puts a smile on my face.  Its the kind of song that says no matter what happens, there will always be a brighter side to things. very optimistic<br />5. right through you (2:55) - ***** this is one of the harder songs, and i love it. its from the point of view of an oppressed person.<br />6. forgiven (5:00) - ****1/2 - i never really figured out what this song means, but its VERY good.<br />7. you learn (3:59) - *****  lol. the video for this song was VERY funny. anyways, it's a very good song.<br />8. head over heels (4:27) - ******* breathtaking } what else can i say?<br />9. mary jane - (4:40)****1/2 a lot of people can relate to this song. Its tight.<br />10. ironic - (3:49) ******** if you haven't heard this song and you were alive and well in 1996, you were either deported to some remote place in the middle of nowhere, or you have and you don't know it (many of my friends did but they didn't even know it was called &quot;ironic&quot; and it was by alanis.  &quot;it's like rain on ur wedding day its the free ride one uve already paid...&quot; <br />11. not the doctor - (3:47) **** Good.<br />12. wake up (4:53)- **** Good.<br />13.

It's the perfect way to end the CD. When you hear it, you'll realize this is no fake, Alanis can really SING!<br />Point blank - BUY THIS<br />NOW!!!!!!<br />Also I recommend :<br />Alanis Morissette - Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie<BR>Alanis Morissette - Under Rug Swept
B000001DQI|5.0|The two records that made ELTON JOHN an international pop star still delivers after all those years.What amazes me here is the variety of songs in styles that ELTON is able to maintain.It is a perfect showcase for his talents as composer.It starts with a progressive song complete with an overture(FUNERAL FOR A FRIEND),and along the way ballads are featured(CANDLE IN THE WIND,GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD)country delights(SWEET PAINTED LADY,ROY ROGERS),reggae(JAMAICA JERK-OFF),and rockers(SATURDAY NIGHTS ALL RIGHT FOR FIGHTING),and even a cute dummy tune(BENNY AND THE JETS).There is absolutely no fillers here.This is a perfect offering;a great double set like very few.Double albums of the time were often disapointing, because they were overstretching a lot.Everybody will find songs that they enjoyed here.A must
B00005LC1H|4.0|You hear lots of constricted breathing, swallowing, phlegm swishing, slurping of drinks, scratching or other playing with oneself for sometimes minutes at a time, chain smoking sounds, clogged nasal passages, etc. It's truly revolting, and I'm glad I got through them all and plan never to turn the commentaries on again.  (This information got lost from my first review attempt.)
B000001EGA|5.0|A very enjoyable concept album about ELTON and lyric writer BERNIE TAUPIN&quot;S early days in the music business,at a time when they were not worldwide names.The added singles of the time only make it more enjoyable,even if they do not fit well,but this is only a detail.Most artists try at one time or another to remember their early days;the difference is that ELTON AND BERNIE have succeeded in doing it, and have managed to remain creative in the project.Belongs in the top 5 category of the singer.
B000021YQV|5.0|This is probably the most original recording I have heard in the past year since their self-titled debut, which might I add should not be forgotten because in it is System of a Down's original hard rock sound. blah blah blah, don't want to bore you guys, this CD is for those of you who are tired of buying those rock cds that all sound alike, this one is a lot more than can be summarized in the genre of rock. blah blah blah go buy it, or pirate it, whatever your thing is. and get their first cd afterwards
B00005RFQ5|5.0|Jazz, funk, soul, cabaret, (jazz)rock, ballads: it's all there, and the performance is too good to be true. This album comes very close to perfection. It's always exciting, surprising and Prince's singing is superb. Yes, we hear Curtis Mayfield and Carlos Santana and James Brown and D'Angelo, we even hear Frank Zappa, but it's unmistakenly Prince, and he's in topform. Hard to say which is the best track, just play the whole album and enjoy every minute of it!!
B00005A46T|4.0|Better thought and written than their 1999 debut LP, &quot;Iowa&quot; will establish Slipknot as a household name in the metal scene, worldwide. Sure, their music has rap-metal cadences, and their sound owes a lot to Korn's. But don't be fooled. The fierce noise attack delivered by this band has enough muscle to allure extreme metal fans as well. Frequently, Slipknot's brand of rock and roll is closer to death metal or to grind core than to &quot;nu-metal&quot;. In fact, numbers like &quot;Disasterpice&quot; pack enough sonic wallop to humiliate many death metal acts. Melody is kept at a minumum in &quot;Iowa&quot;, but when the band gives it a go on &quot;Left behind&quot; and &quot;My plague&quot;, the results are equally compelling. Even the &quot;slower&quot; numbers will blow your mind. Both &quot;Gently&quot; and the title track sart in a relatively calm manner, stay in that way for a minute or two ... and then BOOM!: chaos bursts out all over again. Singer Corey Taylor doesn't rap: he screams his heart and his soul out. But the real stand-out is Joey Jordinson, perhaps the most manic drummer in metal today. Alas, the weak point in &quot;Iowa&quot; are its poorly written lyrics which, predictably, include tons of swear words and tell little more than being very angry and having a miserable life. Nevermind. They get lost amid the furious metal mayhem of this terrific album.
B00005A3KS|5.0|Don't get me wrong, I have liked some of like Keanu's movies, but this may be the worst single perfomance in the history of celluloid.<br /><br />Update - 7/31/2013<br />While I still think this is the worst single performance in the history of celluloid, I am changing my overall grade from 3 to 5 as I now love this movie. It has grown on me over the last decade and I now own it on Blu-Ray. I think this is a film ripe for a remake, although I would like to see perhaps a more dark gritty styling for a remake (think Fincher styling).
B000002HJD|3.0|This is composed of recordings of Jim Morrison reading his rather dull poems set to background music and sound effects.  I'm a Doors fan, so a friend of mine who owns this let me listen to it, but I must say I was disappointed.  I was expecting reptilian saturnalia, surrealism and horror, whereas this is quite tame.  In fact, it's boring.  Segments of live performances are included to liven things up, but the music on here is also included on the fantastic IN CONCERT two-disc anthology, so there isn't much to recommend this.  Those looking for Jim freaking out and channeling bizarre imagery should get IN CONCERT instead.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I would say that this is the most original movie I have seen in a while and by far the best movie I saw come out of 2000. Great screenplay, acting was right on and (most importantly) the movie genuinely allows us to see what it is like to be the protagonist, Mr. Shelby. NOTE: You will HAVE to watch this movie more the once to understand it all. <BR>That being said, I also want to respond to Afaf's question about the pinch/insulin shot: It was definitely a pinch and he did not O/D his wife like Sammy. Based on the guidelines presented for Leonard's disability, he would recall everything up to the truama. This would inlclude the fact that his wife was NOT a diabetic. Mr. Shelby states this, although in a barely audible mumble. If you watch the movie again(which I had to..) it will become obvious.
0385501560|1.0|I've been saving up CHOKE for months for a needy moment, which came this morning when I expected to be spending a couple of hours in a doctor's waiting room. After plowing through fifty pages, however, I decided it would be more fun to just stare at the walls, which is what I did. It's an ugly book about the sort of people you'd cross the street to avoid if you saw them coming in time. Maybe it gets better. I don't intend to find out.
B00003CX95|3.0|Before you slaughter me for giving Braveheart only three stars (actually I'd give it three and a half), let me start by putting my review into some kind of perspective. Not only am I Scottish, born and bred but like all Scots I am extremely patriotic and proud of my country's heritage and its history, particularly the likes of William Wallace. I also acknowledge that Braveheart (and Rob Roy) undoubtedly gave our tourism industry a great boost, particularly with the number of American visitors and for this I am truly grateful BUT, not only is Braveheart a historically questionable account of the events surrounding William Wallace's rebellion against the English in defence of Scotland's 'Freedom!', the modern and truly cheesy dialogue totally spoilt this movie for me.<br />I could give you a very long list of historical inaccuracies to justify why I'd only give Braveheart three stars: First off, there is the fact that Mel Gibson is about a foot shorter than the great big hairy man that was William Wallace (but that doesn't actually interest me). Or the fact that the actual battle that Wallace defeated the English was called the Battle of Stirling Bridge, yet there is no sign of a bridge in Braveheart. Or, what about the fact that the `prima nocta' (legislation allowing English overlords to sleep with Scottish women on their wedding night) just did not exist. Perhaps the most ludicrous suggestion is that Princess Isobelle's child (the future Edward III) was sired by Wallace. Not very likely unless she was impregnated at about the age of four and had a twenty year long pregnancy. Actually there are so many historical inaccuracies I could go on and on BUT I DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT THE HISTORICAL INACCURACIES or the dodgy Scottish accents. I can even forgive the fact that Robert The Bruce (Scotland's greatest ever king and much more famous Scottish hero) is portrayed here as quite a weak, indecisive and possibly even cowardly character. I can also forgive the misguided patriotism that Braveheart has stirred in the uneducated and uncultured part of Scottish society, who didn't even know who Wallace was before Braveheart, and the fact that the councillors of Stirling have erected a horrible tacky dwarf sized statue at the foot of the Wallace monument that closely and embarrassingly resembles Mel Gibson.<br /> What bothers me most, and detracts from my enjoyment of Braveheart, is the truly awful dialogue. I don't think I actually realised just how cheesy it was until I saw it second time around but it really makes me wince. Blame for this lies solely at the feet of Randall Wallace (no relation) who wrote the screenplay. This is the same man who was subsequently responsible for The Man In The Iron Mask (with Leonardo DiCaprio); its dialogue is also far too modern and also extremely corny. It's so bad it's almost on a par with Titanic.<br /> Don't get me wrong BRAVEHEART IS AN ENTERTAINING MOVIE and I'm very glad Mel Gibson made it, but it just isn't culture and it just isn't brilliant. It's a good entertaining movie, better than average and it has a lot of other things going for it. For example, good supporting performances from the likes of Patrick McGoohan,  Catherine McCormack, Brian Cox, Sophie Marceau and James Cosmo). THE BATTLE SCENES ARE EXTREMELY DRAMATIC, EXCITING, WELL FILMED AND DIRECTED. The music is also excellent, the scenery is beautiful (although some of it was actually filmed in Ireland because it was cheaper). As a patriotic Scotsman, I'd truly love to say this was the greatest movie ever made and I wish I could but unfortunately I just can't get past the truly awful dialogue and personally in terms of Scottish historical movies I'd have to recommend Rob Roy.<br />***1/2 stars.triotism that Braveheart has stirred in the uneducated and uncultured part of Scottish society, who didn't even know who Wallace was before Braveheart, and the fact that the councillors of Stirling have erected a horrible tacky dwarf sized statue at the foot of the Wallace monument that closely and embarrassingly resembles Mel Gibson. <br /> What bothers me most, and detracts from my enjoyment of Braveheart, is the truly awful dialogue.

0684803356|4.0|First of all, I recognize that this is a classic novel by one of the most highly regarded writers of the twentieth century. Hemingway was very good; sycophants made him sublime. To criticize this work and not rhapsodize over its poetic beauty and its insightful symbolism would seem to be almost in bad taste. But I will do so anyway. <br />Overall I would have to say that the story is good but not great: Robert Jordan is an American fighting for the communists in the Spanish civil war. He is an instructor in Spanish at a Montana college who has taken a sabbatical  to secretly come to Spain. He wants to fight to liberate the workingman. Jordan is sent by his Russian controller to join  a band of guerrillas behind Fascist lines. His mission is to blow up a bridge; this is timed to precisely coincide with a Republican (communist) offensive. Anselmo, an old man who is the most reliable guerilla, takes him to the band of rebels. The band is led by Pablo, an uncouth peasant who has gone from fervent murderous radical to a man who only wants to survive. Pilar, Pablo's woman, is the unifying force in Pablo's band. There are assorted other rebels and Maria, a refugee who has been raped by the fascists. Maria and Robert Jordan fall in love immediately and are soon fornicating like rabbits. The bridge is attacked and destroyed but this leads to the death of Anselmo and to Robert Jordan being mortally wounded. He orders Maria to go on without him and he bids her to escape and enjoy life; thereby he will live through her.  <br />The book does give a good picture of the issues of the Spanish civil war. The fascists are portrayed as decent people backed by Nazis and Italian fascists. The Republicans are controlled by Russians, as are puppets on a string. Hemingway makes a point to say that the top Republicans all speak Russian, having been trained as revolutionaries in the Soviet Union. The individual peasants Jordan fights with  are mostly portrayed as decent people with a few savages thrown in for good measure.<br />I had several problems with the book. I understand that Hemingway uses the archaic thee and thou to indicate that the dialogue is being spoken in Spanish. He omits this when Jordan is speaking in English or thinking to himself. This takes some getting used to but is tolerable. It is the awkward translation of Spanish obscene phrases that is done in a silly and annoying way. The phrase \\"I obscenity in the milk of your father\\" appears dozens of times.  No one speaks this way. It is patently unnatural and just about ruined the book for me. I understand that this is a literal translation of the Spanish oath \\"me cago en la leche...\\" I understand and don't care. It would have been better to leave the obscenity implied but unsaid without resorting to this awkward device. <br />There is a painfully awkward page where Robert Jordan discovers that Pablo has stolen his detonators. On page 368 he says  \\"Oh muck my grandfather and muck this whole treacherous mucking country and every mucking Spaniard in it on either side and to hell forever\\" and so forth ( in lieu of the word that is an acronym for \\"for unlawful carnal knowledge\\") about two dozen times. I understand that in 1940 that word could not appear in print but did it have to be replaced by something so witless. Funny how that word still can't appear in Amazon.com book reviews in 2002.<br />There is another especially awkward scene that sticks in my mind. Hemingway describes Robert Jordan's feelings at having reached orgasm with Maria on page 379: \\"Oh now, now, now, the only now, and above all now  and there is no other now but thou now and now is thy prophet. Now and forever now. Come now, now, for there is no now but now. Yes, now. \\" and so on for half a page. Give me a break!<br />There is also the problem of some of the poorly drawn and unbelievable characters. Robert Jordan is too perfect to be true (is he Jesus in disguise?). He goes from a mild mannered rural college instructorto a stone killer and demolitions expert in a matter of months. He doesn't have any personal stake in the Spanish conflict but quickly becomes a cool yet eager killer in the service of the Soviet side. His inner dialogue tells us that this is because he has always wanted to do something for downtrodden workers of the world. It is also in part to prove that he is as much a man as his (U.S.) Civil war hero grandfather. The relationship with Maria is unbelievable to the point of being absurd. Jordan is a thirty-something who has never been in love. He and Maria, who is 19,  fall in love at first sight. They immediately decide to have sex ; they plan to get married and live together happily ever after. He is fully aware that he has been handed a suicide mission and is completely unconcerned. How did he live for this long if his own safety is of no interest to him?<br />Much has been made of the fact that this book illustrated the concepts in the Donne poem No Man is an Iland. Well then why do we need nearly five hundred pages of this book when that poem says it so well in a few lines.
0783225857|5.0|It started with the gift of Harper Lee's magical book, a gift to literature., indeed. Then came the movie, a gift to cinema that withstands the test of time.<br />Just look at the opening credits, quite possibly one of the most ingenious and modern looking segments in cinema over the last forty years. It's simplicity absolutely captures the film, while setting the magical mystery on its course, the world of children in a box.<br />Then move on to Gregory Peck's most moving, strong, amazing performance; it's quite possibly the perfect match with role, actor, screenplay. His dignity shines through a dignified role.<br />And then there are the kids, two unknowns, who do their best acting by just being themselves. Mary Badham is absolutely charming and stunning in her innocent portrayal of a terribly difficult role.<br />But what shines most is the story... the story of a black man unjustly accused of a hideous act, the story of a spooky man who lives a life of hiding, ultimately, how we judge others is how we are judged.<br />And that is the lasting gift of this movie, and this DVD.<br />Note: the bonus documentary on the DVD is amazing, long, and very informative, worth all of your time.
B00005JKT8|5.0|Whew Ladies!  We gained the right to vote, and to smoke in public...opps, sorry that's been taken away too...This movie is a breath of fresh sunshine. This movie speaks to me on sooo many levels, Ladies, whether we are really the tougher sex or not, some part of every female really wishes men still stood when a lady walks into a room, felt protected and admired.  I find myself holding doors open for women, and while I'm standing there, men walk into.  Amazing!  I for one felt Ms. Ryan played her part to the hilt, cold, efficient, ever grabbing for the next step up.  She played the modern woman perfectly.  We have become so immune to good manners, that it is an absolute foreign subject to us modern women.  Leopold was a dream, oh where have all the Leopold's gone to? I for one would like to have them back!  Yes!  Kate & Leopold was fantastic, when I saw the movie, men and ladies were clapping at the end of the movie, just like in the \\"good ol' days\\".  Do yourself a favor, don't miss it!
B000001ESF|5.0|2112 is Rush's 1976 orchestral masterpiece. Okay, well, they didn't actually use an orchestra for this album--and that makes it all the more amazing. For nearly the entire 39-minute length of this CD (with the only exception being the synthesizer that opens 2112's &quot;Overture&quot;), the music consists of just 3 instruments: Guitar (both acoustic and electric), bass guitar, and drums.  That's it! Of course, the players happen to be among the greatest ever in their respective instruments. 2112 is also Neil Peart's lyrical masterpiece; it is the first album on which he writes all of the lyrics, and they are nothing short of poetry at its best and most interesting. Welcome to the vision of Alex Lifeson, Geddy Lee, and Neil Peart, in all its wonder and splendor. :)<br />The first half of the CD (actually a bit more than half) consists purely of the epic title track, which at 20:34 is the longest song that Rush has ever done, even to this day. It is also the greatest in the band's history, and this is a band with a long history of great songs! It is the story of a civilization (Human or alien; you decide), set in the titular year, that has sprung up long after nuclear apocalypse.  Everything is run by priests who control &quot;the books you read, the songs you sing&quot; and everything else. Then, one day while out walking in the barren wasteland outside the Great City of Syrinx, a young man discovers a guitar left over from the &quot;elder race of man&quot;. As he begins to strum it, he hears the beautiful music it makes, and it opens up his eyes. As he plays it, he believes that he has made a momentous discovery that will be well-received by others, one for which &quot;the priests (will) praise my name on this night&quot;. Unfortunately, when he brings it to the priests in Syrinx, they immediately dismiss it as &quot;another toy that helped destroy the elder race of man&quot; and a &quot;silly whim&quot;, and bark at him, &quot;Don't annoy us further!&quot; Dejected, the young man goes home and falls into &quot;a fitful sleep&quot;. He dreams that he is sent to an oracle who shows him the various beautiful facets of the former world, and shows him that, eventually, the ones who left after the nuclear holocaust will return to reclaim the world.  He wakes up, now totally hopeless that he will ever see anything beyond his present world. He realizes how lifeless his sanitized world is, and he simply cannot go on living &quot;this cold and empty life&quot;, and he ends it by committing suicide.  <br />Musically, the song &quot;2112&quot; begins with &quot;Overture&quot; which is comprised of pieces of all the successive parts (and comes closer to classical music than anything else done by any other heavy rock band up to that point), and it ends with Geddy Lee softly singing the immortal line, &quot;And the meek shall inherit the earth&quot;, before blazing right into the barn-burner &quot;The Temples Of Syrinx&quot; where Geddy screams his lungs out for 2 minutes before surprisingly ending with 10 seconds of soft acoustic guitar.  Things then go back to square-one with &quot;Discovery&quot; which is a soft acoustic number. &quot;Presentation&quot; alternates between soft (as the voice of the hero) and hard (as voice of the priests in anger), before turning into a speed-metal workout, with a blistering lead guitar solo. &quot;Oracle: The Dream&quot; turns upbeat and hopeful as the hero finds out how the world once was, &quot;Soliloquy&quot; is gloomy and dark, and it represents the despair the hero feels after awakening, ending with his final act of suicide. &quot;Grand Finale&quot; is an ultra-blistering 2 1/2 minute instrumental that sums up, I think, the chaos the world falls into as a result of the hero's death, ending with the final conquest of the world by the former inhabitants who announce (in the spoken voice of Neil Peart), &quot;Attention all planets of the Solar Federation...we have assumed control.&quot; What an incredible piece of musical storytelling this is!! There has not been anything like it before or since.<br />Although 2112 is only one-half of a concept album, the remaining 5 songs, while not tied to this or any other concept in particular, follow up very well with songs about travel &amp; adventure, sci-fi, lessons, tears, and self-determinism. My favorite is &quot;A Passage To Bangkok&quot; which is a heavy-metal excursion into the land of adventurism on the rails; it's a cool travelogue into which your mind supplies the pictures from the lyrics and music. I also love &quot;Something For Nothing&quot;, which starts out with a nice, soft melody but then whips itself into a heavy rock song where Geddy Lee screams the advise &quot;You don't get something for nothing / You can't have freedom for free&quot;, which incidentally, is especially true these days!  That's what makes Rush a truly timeless band, for they were both of their time and ahead of their time. 2112 has cemented its place as one of the most important musical works of 1976 and in the history of rock and roll. It's also among my top 20 favorite heavy-metal albums ever! It's great either as an introduction to Rush or after one has been introduced by way of MOVING PICTURES and PERMANENT WAVES. Either way, MOST RECOMMENDED
0783226128|5.0|Scarface is clearly the epitomy of everything that is great about film-making. Al Pacino shines as Tony Montana and shows why he is the best actor in the world. The supporting cast is also amazing especially &quot;Manny&quot;. The only thing I could find to say is wrong with the film is the music, it's so 80's but then it was made in the 80's.<BR>The first time I watched the film I was glued to it and was deeply shocked by the chainsaw scene. I would definitely recommend the film on DVD for fans of the film as the quality and extras are great. There are deleted scenes also that I can see why they left them out.<BR>There are so many quotes to recite from the film which shows how good it is. From the outset you wouldn't think you would like Tony Montana but with Pacino's natural charisma and Stone's at times humourous portrayal you cannot help it. <BR>Scarface IS one of the best film's ever made.
0802114970|5.0|Ms. Weir did an excellent job on this book! Her research was, I thought, impeccable. Ms. Weir has succeeded in bringing to life this 'larger than life' king and his many wives, while keeping to the facts and writing in an unbiased fashion.

(along with &quot;Marie Antoinette:The Journey&quot; by Antonia Fraser, &quot;The Life of Elizabeth I&quot;, Alison Weir, &quot;The Princes In The Tower&quot;, also by Alison Weir to name a few)<br />Thank you Ms. Weir, you've done it again! Remarkable!
B00005JKQX|2.0|Ron Howard took a story with great potential and turned it into a sentimentally formulaic film that the stodgy Academy will most certainly adore.  Too much time is spent leading up to Nash's breakdown.  Howard rushes us through 30 years of Nash's life in 30 minutes time.  The drama and true depth of this story can be found in Nash's lifetime attempt to manage his disease, and not simply in the events that lead up to his hospitalization and relatively brief treatment period.
B00004Y6O9|4.0|Generally speaking, I lean more towards Bon Jovi, Megadeth, and King Diamond. But even if you are not really a Van Halen fan, this record should really be in your collection. (We all have our favorite groups, but that doesn't mean there isn't value to be found in other groups too.) This record has a nice edge that is a gem in the 70s. It will grab your attention right away with 'Running With the Devil.' Van Halen follows this up with the memorable instrumental 'Eruption.' Diamond Dave's vocals then return with the energetic 'Girl, You Really Got Me Now,' and 'Aint Talkin About Love.' 'Jamie's Crying' is a little softer, but it has a nice sound. The energy comes back with 'Atomic Punk and 'Feel Your Love Tonight' 'Ice Cream Man' has kind of a PG 13 undertone, but that's alright seeing that it's accomplished without the use of obscenities. And the record offers a great finish with 'On Fire.' This record has great guitar work, a good consistency, and some of Diamond Dave's greatest efforts. If you like 70s-80s rock, you will enjoy this record. Even if you have to take a trip to a 'you name it, we got it' place, get this record for your collection.
6304698542|5.0|i was so excited to see this on DVD, and with all the interviews of the stars who are still alive.  I saw this movie just when I graduated college, and it's still the best of Liza, and perhaps one of the best musicals ever on film.  Tho I know the movie version was much different than the original Broadway play, I love it.  and I'll watch it annually or more often to enjoy the production numbers, and remember the message, so somber against the music.
B00004Z459|5.0|I'm 38 and I take exception to teens saying that I would not like this CD. I love it, my nephew has gotten me into Staind and Linkin Park among others, and Linkin Park is now my favorite CD, I play it every where. I say if you ever liked Rock and Roll, rather it be Led Zepplin in the 70's or Van Halen in the 80's, then I can't see anyone suddenly not liking today's Rock. It is all Rock and Roll. I will be rocking when I'm 80!! (and not in a rocking chair).
0060934913|5.0|This is how it really can be in the restaurant business. Perhaps the best book I have read in a long time. Though being a chef I have not had much time to read other than the quick reference of a few cookbooks. Hats off to Boudain who can not only cook but can write text interesting, funny and captivating. Anyone who has worked in restaurants can identify with this book. You Know who you are!

B000002MUN|4.0|By the release of &quot;Wildflowers&quot; it was apparent that Tom Petty was never going to record the universally acknowledged masterpiece album of which all his fans have thought him capable.  The closest he ever came was the adventuresome &quot;Southern Accents&quot; in 1985.  Since then, Petty has settled into a comfortable groove, recoding albums that feature twangy giutars, his signature nasal vocals and a few pop gems.  The best tracks here are the title song, &quot;You Don't Know How it Feels,&quot; &quot;You Wreck Me&quot; and &quot;A Higher Place.&quot;  All four will be fine additions to his next Greatest Hits album.  Between those highlights are plenty of pleasent filler material, with the occasional clunker, &quot;Honey Bee&quot; in particular.<br />Overall, &quot;Wildflowers&quot; will please any Tom Petty fan, but it is unlikely to win him any new converts.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Gee... I Don't know where to start. This CD is brilliantly written and sung. Many say this is the best album of the 90's, and I think it sure lives up to that. I REALLY enjoy every song, and my favorites are Paranoid Android, Karma Police, No surprises, and Lucky. And my favorite songs keep changing because all of them are amazing. I've only had this for 5 months but in that 5 months I've listened to it just about every 2-3 days and I love every song and I haven't grown tired of it yet and I never will. It is the most addicting album I've ever bought because whenever i listen to one of the mp3s on my computer I just havae to listen to the whole album and whenever I listen to it, I just want to listen forever. Even when i think about the album I have to go play it. I have loved it more and more each time i listen to it, even when the number of listens goes into the thousands. You won't realize each and every song is amazing until you listen to it at least 20 times. \\"Paranoid Android\\" is my favourite Radiohead song. It is 6:23 in length and I love every single second of it. (and the video is interesing no matter what you say!) I suggest this to ANYONE! If you like it, I suggest purchasing Kid A, then Amnesiac, then The Bends. All Classics. After buying it you will realize why everyone says Radiohead is the best band and this is their best album. I am so glad I discovered it and chose to buy it. It just takes time to completely understand.
B0000009TK|5.0|Being an avid Zappa collector, this is one of my personal favorites.  In fact, this is the 3rd time I've purchased this CD.  No more lending of THIS one!<BR>Jazzy, Jazzy, Jazzy.  This is a fine example of the '88 touring band that (in my opinion) blows the rest of the bands away.  A great mix of live shows with fantastic orchestration.  Jazzy, Funky, typically weird, and always done with a smile, this is an excellent CD, especially at this price.
B00005NP04|5.0|This cd is full of her best hits! I did not know she sang some of those songs!  They are my favorites! I urge you to buy this cd!You'll be satisfied, guanteed!
0786867973|5.0|I bought this book for my girlfriend as a christmas present.  I also gave her a rolling pin, so I suppose I can be grateful she didn't hit me with it.  Anyway, she has always expressed an interest in Baking so I thought this would be an ideal introduction to this often intimidating form of cookery.<br />So far, all I can say is the results are amazing.  She's tried the white bread and the American style pancakes and they are fantastic for a first effort - which must be a testament to Nigella's recipes and excellant instructions.  My girlfriend can testify that much of the inspiration (which is so important with non-essential cookery like baking) is taken from the mouthwatering photos that are on nearly every second page.<br />All in all, a well written, comprehensive, no nonsence, introduction to the art of baking.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is what DVDs were created for. This two-disc set is simply crammed with all sorts of juicy behind-the-scenes details, as well as hidden &quot;green fairies&quot; and &quot;red windmills&quot; that you can find to glean even more dirt. And that's just on disc two. <br />Disc one, which contains the movie itself, gives you an option to watch the movie in full, but find the &quot;green fairies&quot; within the movie. Each green fairy that pops up on the screen gives you even more juicy tidbits about the scene that you're watching. (Warning -- if you actually do this, it'll take a good 3.5 hours to watch the movie. :)
B00005N9CV|5.0|My, but it's been amusing to read the reviews that rip apart Miss Krall. Lighten-up! If not, tuck your warped and scratched vinyls of Billie Holiday and Diane Schuur under your arm and please leave the rest of us alone. To the rest of you: BUY THIS CD. What's wrong with full orchestrations this time around? Or sensual liner photos of someone this gorgeous? Or does Miss Krall's genuine beauty somehow make her talent less legitimate? Know this: her CD-bin at the record store is almost always empty and her live performances are always sold-out. If it's your first time with Miss Krall...you'll only love her previous offerings all the more. I'm glad this CD has motivated you to pull back the curtain to discover this artist. Again: Welcome! Meanwhile, some of my compadres in this list of reviews give the jazz/blues genre a bad name... I'm disappointed by those compelled to use this forum to commiserate in an elitist fashion as to who among them is the &quot;truest&quot; jazz aficionado. Don't be so silly. Shed thy &quot;snooty-ness.&quot; All that matters is musical stylings, soothing vocal interpretations and a sound that just,...well,...makes one feel....wonderful. The blessing of great music. And this disc does just that. It's lovely.
B000059PPN|5.0|I am a big fan of the Lucio Fulci-movies. The house by the cemetery is one of the most bloody. It is about a family, Norman Boyle, Lucy Boyle and their little son Bobby. They are gonna move to New York, for Norman have to do researches for his job. They are gonna live in a house by a cemetery. Its live in by a crazy medical man, Dr.Freudstein for over 150 years, and he stays to be alive by human flesh and blood. He lives into the cellear under the house for over 150 years. At that moment, strange things happens and he tries to catch and murder the family by a violent way.  <BR>The music of the film is great; it is been composed by Walter Rizatti and Alexander Bloncksteiner. It conserns the opening titletrack and the closing.
0792844793|5.0|Despite its notoriety as a weird or kinky film, &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; should be both structurally and thematically clear to anyone who has read a narrative such as Hawthorne's &quot;Young Goodman Brown&quot; and who has at least a moderate interest in Freud's ideas about love as well as Nietzsche's thoughts on the Dionysian self.  It's also a film that pays constant homage to Hitchcock's best work, notably &quot;Rear Window&quot; and &quot;Psycho.&quot; <br />The most important lines occur early in the film when the protagonist, Kyle MacLachlan, tells Laura Dern that he needs to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding Isabella Rosselli because &quot;knowledge requires risk&quot; but with the possible reward that &quot;you might learn something.&quot; By the end of the narrative, MacLachlan's character should have learned a lot, but here's where Lynch flinches, much like Robert Altman in the conclusion to &quot;The Player.&quot; MacLachlan emerges neither a sadder nor wiser man from his rite of passage and his descent into the dark corners of the psyche. Instead, Lynch commits the ultimate cynical sin, reprising the film's innocent opening and throwing in the viewer's face the hopelessly artificial, Pollyanna-ish, pastoral idyl that is most likely the preferred reality of the American mainstream movie consumer.<br />This is not the place for a detailed analysis of the film, though some of the following may help the viewer make sense of the narrative. Jeff confronts first mortality (his father stricken by a life-threatening stroke), then a severed, decaying human ear. The ear, the organ of hearing, is also the sense that fully awakens only in the dark, granting access to the Dionysian, the deep intuitive wellsprings of the self. But the ear we see on screen has become a diseased, useless instrument in a &quot;sunny&quot; culture whose idea of music is Bobby Vinton's version of &quot;Blue Velvet.&quot; Rossellini's alternative version of the song, with all of its sensuous, alluring darkness, will draw MacLachlan in to the same degree that it repells girl friend Dern (contrast this relationship with that of Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly in &quot;Rear Window,&quot; where Kelly becomes increasingly drawn to the voyeuristic and &quot;ghoulish&quot; activity initiated by Stewart). Soon MacLaclan will discover the love substitutes embodied by both Rossellini and Hopper--the sadism and masochism, fetishism and scopophilia that, like it or not, are present in every son and daughter who has inherited from birth and learned from upbringing the pleasure/pain principle that underlies even the most well-intentioned, &quot;selfless&quot; love (the absence of any shown feelings between MacLaclan and either parent is another tip-off to the basis of his attraction to the dominitrix/sex slave character played by Rossellini). <br />Certainly Lynch must know, along with every other artist who has dealt with the theme, the risk along with the necessity of making touch with these feelings in order to achieve a fuller, richer, more knowing life in the time one has left. MacLaclan tells the naive and shielded Dern from the beginning that it's extremely dangerous business (think of Mann's &quot;Death in Venice&quot;). But the alternative is a Salem where everybody is &quot;good,&quot; a Lumberton where people get sick but never die, a Disney fantasy that can exist only in artificial movies. Lynch may have thought he was being ironically clever by giving his viewers the &quot;escape&quot; they probably crave. I'd say &quot;cowardly&quot; is more like it. This film (in fact, most any other film since 1980) is easily eclipsed by his own &quot;Elephant Man,&quot; where both the screenplay and the circumstances of the historical John Merrick insured the right ending. Unfortunately, someone let him write his own script for &quot;Blue Velvet.&quot;
6305627401|4.0|Alright...South Park is not my cup of tea. However, I bought this DVD for my 25 year old son at xmas along with a new DVD player. He also has this movie on VHS. After talking to him about the DVD...he told me he and his roommate watched it 4 times the first day he had his DVD player hooked up. I guess this means it's a hit!? I have another son who was rather upset that he didn't receive the South Park movie also. So I'll be ordering again.
B00005QDW1|4.0|This No Doubt album is different from all the rest so I am going to review it just as a CD by itself and not comparing it to anything else. Track-by-track here goes-<br />Intro.- This is only about 30 seconds long so I guess you can't really call it a song. It's kind of slow and the melody is not all that great. Although some may be able to deal with 30 seconds of this, it's something worth skipping altogether.<br />Hella Good- Considering this is the first &quot;song&quot; on the album, I would have to say it's a bad start. The beginning of the song is pretty neat but is soon drowned out by the chorus. After the second verse the chorus comes back and doesn't seem to go away. With the same beat and some pretty empty lyrics, this doesn't rank very high on my favorites list.<br />Hey Baby- Almost everybody has heard this song on the radio, and it's pretty good. It's catchy and gets stuck in your head (in a good way). This is a favorite, probably because it's so fun, but I have to admit the endless &quot;Hey Baby&quot;'s get a little annoying after a few listens. A favorite.<br />Making Out- This is another good song on the album. The beginning starts out with a really good beat that makes you want to continue listening. This is a song that you can't help but sing-a-long to. The chorus is fun and doesn't get dull. Great.<br />Underneath It All- This song is like reggae. It's pretty good, definitely not comparable to Bob Marley, but still good. The whole fun of it is the reggae sound. Good.<br />Detective- This song is great. The melody is pretty good and the lyrics are pretty good. It's not poetry but hey, we could all use a little fun in our lives. It's so different yet fun with the whole &quot;Hey girl, save the liar, can't you see his pants on fire?&quot; part. <br />Don't Let Me Down- This song is O.K. Not really a favorite yet I don't not like it either. It's one of those &quot;I can deal with it temporarily&quot; songs. <br />Start The Fire- This is a song I don't like. To me, it's boring and never caught my attention. However, it does have it's occasional good parts.<br />Running- This song starts out sounding like a Nintendo game. It however, is a really sweet song. What is kind of interesting is that it is called &quot;Running&quot; but it is really slow, relaxing, and kind of like a lullaby (in a good way).<br />In My Head- This song is a good song for days when you feel down. It's pretty fun though and I like it a lot. Probably because it's done differently than a lot of what you normally hear.<br />Platinum Blonde Life- This song is another &quot;temporarily&quot; songs. It's a song that's easy to get sick of except for a few melodies that are pretty cool and good to listen to.<br />Waiting Room- Strange song. It reminds me of &quot;Hella Good&quot;. Another song that just is kind of plain. It's good experimentation though. <br />Rock Steady- A pretty good end to the album. Has the &quot;Intro.&quot; part in it, but it's still pretty good.<br />Overall I think this album is pretty good. It has a few &quot;under-satisfactory songs&quot; but enough good songs to kind of cover it up.
0060934913|5.0|I can understand how other reviewers may find Bourdain's ego and bad boy history a bit over the top... but you have to understand that it is dead on.  That's how life is in the New York restaurant scene-- at least a major part of it (which Bourdain nicely documents in the Life of Bryan chapter).<br />If he comes off as having an ego the size of Manhattan and a history that would make most criminals cringe, it is because *that's what it took* for him to succeed (and he is a success).
B00000K0DT|5.0|Spacey, in a role written for him, delivers in a complex and engrossing film that has to be purchased, as repeat viewings are mandatory for this exquisite film.<br />I won't rehash certain elements, as I'm sure you can find all you need in other reviews.  But, if you are a fan of films that require you to engage your brain, then this movie is definitely on your must-see list.  The performances are all filled with subtexts, and the story is tight as a drum!<br />Also, the ending is the reason DVD players need a 'review' button.  I can guarantee you will be glad you bought The Usual Suspects, rather than pay rental fees multiple times.
B00005JKQX|5.0|This is a masterfully made movie. What it lacks in historical accuracy, it balances with imagination, suspense, and outstanding performance by the entire cast. Making a movie about a mathematician for the mass market is a daunting task, but Ron Howard, the cast, and the entire crew more than met the challenge. Everybody here is a potential Oscar nominee, and if the make up crew does not get one, something is rotten in Hollywood. The approach chosen in this film is to show the effect of schizophrenia from the inside, from the perspective of the genius-sufferer John Nash. The director uses this manuever to full advantage, including the use of a fatal car chase and some gore, which of course would have been impossible without Nash's paranoid delusions.<br />Perhaps purists, who demand historical accuracy, will be less than satisfied with the film, but I do not believe that Howard could have made a more historically complete choice and still kept his audience. For one thing, Nash was neither as pathetic, nor as lovable, as he is portrayed in the film. In his younger days as a student at Princeton, his arrogance and sarcasm overshadowed his aloofness and early symptoms of incipient schizophrenia. This is not quite what the movie portrays. Second, Nash's real life story is far more complicated than a two-hour uplifting life/love story that is the movie. Many important details about him are left out for the sake of idealistic aspirations of the movie. For example, there is no mention of his early homosexual tendencies; his brief life with his mistress and the child they had together; his work for the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica (yes, Nash did have a security clearance and access to classified information, which he lost soon after he made a pass to an undercover police officer in a public bathroom--in this sense George Michael is a case of dejavu); the fact that he and Alicia got divorced after Nash fell ill, even though Alicia did take him back in 1970; the fact thathis second child, which he had with Alicia, became mentally ill in his teens and remains so to this day, as far as I know; the fact that when Nash experienced spontaneous remission he again became overly critical and even sometimes cruel toward those who loved him. I think you get the picture: Nash's life story is complicated and is less idealistic and uplifting than the movie. Even his paranoid tendencies were less rational and humane than the movie shows. As far as I remember, his problem did NOT lie in seeing nonexistent people. After all, how terrible is it to have an imaginary friend, an overzealous government employer, and to fear Russian spies? In truth, Nash believed that space aliens made him the King of Antarctica, that the U.S. and NATO hated him for some reason (he traveled to Europe and tried to give up his U.S. citizenship with amazing persistence), and that it was alien messages from outer space, not Russian codes that he had to decipher. But if you want to know more, read the book by the same title. The movie stands alone as a superb work of cinematography and as an uplifting, if not entirely true story. The basic premise however is true: Nash was a mentally ill genius and Alicia was a saint.
6305972591|5.0|Children of The Corn is probably one of my favorite films based on Stephen King books. It has everything we'd expect from a great novel turned into a better film and it didn't need visual effects. I recommend this to any fan of Stephen King.
B0000549B0|4.0|James Stewart gives yet another sterling performance as Elwood P. Dowd in Harvey.  Elwood is a bit of a drinker and his companion is a six foot tall rabbit named Harvey that only he seems to be able to see.  Of course everyone around him thinks he's crazy and blames the booze, especially his sister played by Josephine Hull.  The script is a little flimsy, but Mr. Stewart is a genuine master and he digs deep into what could have been a toss off role and exposes the heart and soul of Elwood.  Ms. Hull is excellent and she took home the 1950 Best Supporting Actress Oscar.

B00003CXSP|4.0|when you watch this movie, and you'll understand it.  I loved Hannibal...and had several friends who hated it, because they expected a true SOTL sequel.  If you understand that Hannibal is from the viewpoint of Lector, and the imagry is lush and refined, much like Hannibal would demand.  If you think you are getting a by the book sequel, you will be dissapointed.  If you think you are getting a look into the mind of one of the most intriquing characters created in the 20th century, you will NOT be dissapointed.
0897500482|5.0|As there are many reviews, I just wanted to add my personal experience with this book. I purchased this book when I first started martial arts (Tae Kwon Do and Filipino martial arts). It was interesting and had much good stuff. Seven years later, and a couple weeks ago, I started reading it again--5 minutes here, 10 minutes there. My view is very different now! Bruce Lee's notes and insights have a new meaning for me as I have a different perspective gained by my experience. In any case, it has continued to inspire and motivate me, as well as giving me hints for certain nuances in my training. Get this book ASAP and browse it. They are Bruce's personal notes, so you can read them a little at a time and gain knowledge each time. Let those little tidbits of wisdom rattle around your subconscious mind for a while, maybe seven years like me. The pick the book up again. The understanding and enlightenment you receive will be like a lightning bolt! Then perhaps you too will write a positive review like mine.
B00005AACC|5.0|I was not a big fan of the first Mission Impossible but when I Saw Part 2 I thought it was better than it. Tom Cruise had a lot more to work with more stunts,action and a better looking love interest than in the first. Also Ving Rhames was better. I recommend this film for anyone who likes good action and an all in all great piece of cinema.
B00005Q2RZ|4.0|Many people are basically hammering Ryan Adams, even going to the point that the new CD &quot;Gold&quot; is too long, and overproduced. Well, I would agree with that if &quot;Gold&quot; was really bad and long...But this CD is excellent for most of the way through. <BR>The first four songs are just incredible....You can't take that away from Ryan. As a matter of fact, there is not a bad song until the overlong, but not too annoying &quot;Nobody girl&quot;. This song is very different from all the other songs, and seems to go nowhere. The worst song on the album is probably &quot;Enemy fire&quot;, which is surprising because it was written by Adams and the very talented Gillian Welch. What was she thinking?<BR>The emotion this guy gives on this album sounds genuine, unlike what some reviewers have mentioned. Just absolutely beautiful touching songs like &quot;La Cienega just smiled&quot;, &quot;When the stars go blue&quot;, &quot;Sylvia Plath&quot;, &quot;Wildflowers&quot;, and &quot;Harder now that its over&quot;, aspire to the likes of Neil Young, Bruce Springsteen, and Jay Farrar. <BR>The second cd is also really good and sounds more like older Whiskeytown. The only complaint I have about Adams music is that he references bars and smoking way too much in his lyrics. He needs to write more Sylvia Plath like songs..I know he can, because he has the capability of being one of the greatest songwriters of his era. For now, &quot;Gold&quot; is really good, but it still places second to Whiskeytown's &quot;Strangers Almanac&quot; , which is one of my all time favorites.
031286504X|5.0|I don't normally like short stories but this book is full of great short stories! Each one has a wonderfully horrible twist'ed' ending. I found myself unable to put the book down. The novel &quot;I am Legend&quot; was outstanding. You really got into Robert Neville's world and I found myself wondering what I would do in his position. This is a must read!
B00003CXFV|4.0|OK....I've always found Julia Roberts pleasant, but figured her acting range was probably somewhere in the same force as a Daisy Air Rifle (I DID see Mary Reilly, after all!).  I was amazed.  She fleshed out a seriously flawed character and gives her warmth, charm, and grit.<br />My one flaw with the movie is Erin's full-force bravado that comes with little reproach.  She manages to fire off some SERIOUSLY mean things, but yet is never really heald accountable for them.  Hard to suspend my disbelief when most real life situations calling for this would probably get you belted.<br />Overall, a seriously well acted film that horrifically depicts the corrupting power of a large corporation and it's ripple effect on a community and on lives.  But it also shows how much power one person really can have.
B000002JOH|5.0|Hey, this is to all the people who gave this a 1-star review and said these guys have no talent. I'm sure you're right! Yeah, one of America's premier thrash metal bands has no talent and a singer who can't sing. What did you say was better? 98 Degrees and the Backstreet Boys? OK, OK, NO! What have you been on, people? Pantera rocks! Listen to \\"... Hostile\\" and \\"Rise\\", then tell me you didn't at least bang your head, short of break furniture and thrash around. You have to be inhuman to play music like this! It's too brutal and too fast. Just try and keep up. I dare you. I doubt even Mudvayne or Slayer could play at this intensity and speed. Oh, and if you think these guys swear a lot, remind me to introduce you to Limp Bizkit and Insane Clown Posse, not to mention almost ALL (c)rap bands alive. Each of these bands and styles have single songs that contain more curses than this whole CD. How squeamish are you? Go back to your ... CD. Before you pollute this website with stupid reviews, you need to think first people!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Sure there's a psychotic looking bunny-rabbit-suit-man with an eerily sweet voice, but that's just a detail; it's all about time-travel and destiny.  It is just so darn good.  It will either make you depressed, happy, or really confused depending how you interpret the film.  Plus there is just some truly classic American humor. See it, love it
B00005JKQX|3.0|Andrew Sarris, the dean of the Auteur theory of film criticism said recently that &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; was the best film he had seen on the condition of mental illness.  And I would have to agree, in that along with the requisite &quot;snake pit&quot; type shock treatments and patients running about frothing at the mouth, there seems to be clear, concise minds behind the conception and implementation of this film...i.e Ron Howard and Akiva Goldman, the screenwriter.<br />And it doesn't hurt to have Russell Crowe around to essay the role of John Nash, the real life Mathematics genius and Nobel Prize winner.  But I think it is Jennifer Connelly who really, finally comes into her own as an actress after many fine<br />performances in films like &quot;Inventing the Abbots&quot; and in particular, &quot;Requiem for a Dream.&quot; As Alicia Nash, she gives a persuasive, eloquent performance of an intelligent woman who &quot;loves not wisely but well.&quot; She is John Nash's only support and backbone who doesn't lose faith in him when all signs point to her taking the proverbial hike.<br />Sarris was obviously referring to the scenes in &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; in which John Nash is literally confronted with his demons and chooses to ignore them as a way of coping and perservering. Nash knows he's schizophrenic and conditions himself to cope with it. These are scary scenes, heretofore unseen in any film I can think of, and they are genuinely moving.<br />This is the most successful of Ron Howard's serious films and he is to be congratulated on making this one as realistic as he could without descending into the ridiculous and maudlin.
0449002632|5.0|Edward Rutherford's &quot;London&quot; is a monumental epic that spans a two milleniums in one of Englands oldest and exciting places: London. From the Invasion of the Romans to the Glorious Revolution to the present day, Rutherford manages to trace important historical events by followimg several London families throughout the ages. The scence changes from chapter to chapter, never letting the reader have a dull moment. Although the chapters (and the book) are quite long, you will be captivated at the incredible tales and characters that you find. These tales of adventure, intrigue, murder and love are all realistic and yet at the same time extraordinary as are the characters. Some, like the Silversleeves, you will learn to revile and others,like the Duckets, you will learn to love and root for. I recommend this book to anyone who likes learning about history and likes a riviting story at the same time.
0375805613|5.0|Both the 2 y/o and the 35 y/o males in the house LOVE this book.  Because of this, all of the children within the extended family (under age 5) received a copy of this book and it's sequel, &quot;Another Monster at the End of This Book&quot;, for Christmas!<br />This is book is going to read over and over and over again!
B00005O3VC|5.0|I once read in a review that one had to either love or hate the Pythons, that there were no in-betweens.  Well, that was wrong.  My opinion was of them was somewhere in-between, at least until seeing this movie.  I'm totally in *LOVE* w/the Pythons now! The Holy Grail is so freakin' hilarous that I was literally rolling on the floor laughing. I took a course in Medieval History and to have everything I was taught made fun of, saterized and totally torn to pieces (and done in so great a way) was fabulous. A great movie for anyone who wants a great spoof on medieval lore or just wants to have tons of fun.
0618154043|5.0|Like The Silmarillion but even more so, this book is an unusual form of fiction. The pieces in this book range from short philological essays to full narratives, and range in completeness from scattered fragments that conflict with one another, through polished tales that end abruptly, to more complete works. But if the appendices to The Lord of the Rings were your favorite part, and you want even more of the intricate backstory behind Tolkien's stunning narratives, buy this book immediately without fear of disappointment.<br />Unfinished Tales fleshes out in more detail what is only alluded to elsewhere. Here we get fully written stories, if incomplete, of Tuor and T&uacute;rin, whereas in The Silmarillion their tales received much briefer treatment. We learn more about N&uacute;menor: a map of the island, a chronology of its kings, and a story from early in its history. We find a well-written account of the ambush of Isildur at the Gladden Fields, and get a hint of what the power of N&uacute;menor was before its waning. We learn more about the Rohirrim. More about what else happened during the War of the Ring. And most tantalizing, we get short (if fragmentary) essays on the Wizards, the Palant&iacute;ri, and the Dr&uacute;edain.<br />Remarkably consistent, most of these works appear to have been written late in Tolkien's life, by which I mean after The Lord of the Rings was published: he's filling in details rather than establishing the basic structure. (Even the empty lands of Enedwaith and Minhiriath get histories.) One exception is the conflicting histories of Galadriel, whose role, it seems, Tolkien was still trying to work out.
B000002U6E|5.0|The music of Enigma and lyrics are great. The style of this album has changed from the first album. I think these have been known by anyone, even someone isn't Enigma fan. But there is one big confusion about one of the song in this album I must clarify here, its name is Return to Innocence.<br />This 1996 Olympic theme was released with in the Cross of Changes in 1993. Soon it hit the chart in US and Europe. This song has great dance rhythm, fine lyric singing and, of course, impressive vocables. Because MC never told where this vocable chant was from, so that became a gossip for people who have heard that song.<br />Searched for more than a hundred websites, what I found, from India to American Native (American Natives have more than hundreds of singing styles, people who insists the vocable was from NA couldn't tell which one was that), were all wrong. The chant was recorded in France while Mr and Mrs Kuo, two Native TAIWNAESE (Ami(Ah-mei) Tribe) Aboriginal singers performed in Paris 1988. <br />Mr and Mrs Kuo didn't get the credit or direct pay from Enigma, but some people find this fact out and result a CNN interview for Kuo's before 1996 Olympic. I myself don't hate Enigma, because if they didn't use the vocable, the Native Taiwanese voice won't even be heard by Taiwanese....because of them some Taiwanese artists started to use the singing, rhythms from Native tribes. Just use without even telling the original owner is known as stealing. But this album deserve a 5 star because of its music.<br />Read lots of review, including the Amazon.com one, all misrecognize the origin of this vocable; I think I should stand out to tell the truth. Even it might be sharp to hear. Also, hope amazon.com's reviews will change their review, too. A wrong written history will have bad influence on people who see them.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|If I could explain this movie in two words, i would use confusing, and great.<br />It stars Guy Pearse(L.A. Confidental, The count of monte crisco)Joe Pantiliano(The Matrix, The sopranos television series) and Carrie Anne Moss(The Matrix).<br />Gur pearse is a man who has no short term memory, so he cant remember anything past 15 minutes.To remembe things, he takes pictures, wirties notes on them and also get tattos on his body.Joe Pantiliano plays a man who is friends with guy pearse, but you never truly know who he is.Finally Carrie Anne Moss plays a mysterious women, who doesnt turn out to be who she really is.<br />Sounds simple right?Well its not. The story is told backwards.it gets very confusing. For example:lets say that a scene begins with guy pearse getting dressed, that scene will play and then the movie will go to black and white and he will be talking on the phone.Then, he stops talking another scene happens, and that scene would end with him getting dressed.it continues like that until the end.For most of the moiv, you dont know who he is talking to, but when you find out, you wont be disapointed.<br />The movie is rated R for Violence, Language, and Some Drug Use, so the movie is not for everybody.This might be a movie where you need to watch it more than once to understand it.If you can stay with the plot, the ending will mesmorize you, it's so great how its connected to the beginning. I suggest you go see this movie right now.
B00005OM4N|4.0|This album is a step for Briney. I buy the album and I am happy with the purchase.  I'm A Slave 4 U and Boys has a new pop style.  I love Let Me Be. (it is a song with a lot of power).  Anticipating is a song that reminds me the Britney of Sometimes .  <BR>  <BR>I hope to love the other song accompanied by the video or the promotion. For this reason my stars are 4 * * * *
0425107469|4.0|I don't read much horror, but I used to read a lot of Stephen King when I was in my 20's.  However, this is still my favorite horror novel.  A government experiment produces a super-smart dog as well as a smart monster, they escape, and mayhem ensues.  I've only read a few of Koontz's novels, but his writing ability never ceases to impress me.  Horror, sci-fi and fantasy (and probably mystery, romance...) authors are often not considered to be great writers, but that's a mistake.  This book has horror, romance, action, and the special animals.  One warning: the movie based on this book is TERRIBLE.  I can't over-emphasize this.  I think I read that Dean Koontz made them remove his name from it - that's how bad it was.  The main character was changed from being 30-something to a teenager (because teens are the biggest horror movie audience), and what was perhaps even more crazy and laughable, 1 good and 1 bad<BR>character from the book *were combined into one character in the movie*!!!
B00005OM4N|4.0|Britney boogies like no one else and this is her album. So why not pack it with dance toons and &quot;rock n roll&quot;.  She always seems to impress me with her remakes, like the one featured in this album, I Love Rock And Roll.  Originally sung by another great singer, Joan Jett, I believe.  For any teenage girl going through the change from girl to woman will be albe to relate to this album more than ever.  She hits those hits on target.  Talking about being &quot;Overprotect&quot;. &quot;Anticipating&quot; for your moment.  Explaining that you are &quot;Not Yet A Girl, Not Yet a Woman&quot;.  Or the wonderfully explained &quot;Boys&quot; oh yes. Don't we all love those boys!  I have to admit that this album is a change from her previous ones.  The change is good, growing up with Britney is our slogan.  :)
B0000399WI|5.0|This is officially the greatest movie ever.I loved it, and it was entertaining from beginning to end. At first i thought i would not like it but i did.It is my favorite movie of all time.I had 5 friend over one day and we were bored so i made them watch it.They didnt want to but i made them.All of them loved it.Two of my friends agree with me and say its their favorite movie ever, and my other three friends say it was great.<br />The cast is amazing.It stars Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.Tim Robbins palys Andy.He is a banker who is accused of murdering his wife, so he is put in prison for life.Morgan Freeman plays Red, the first person in prison who makes friends with Andy.The movie is simply about all of the things that happen at the prison including new inmates, and working in the fields.The plot seems boring but it is not. There is never a dull moment, and the ending is simply mesmorising.<br />The movie is rated R for language and prison violence.If you are in the mood for a good movie, and dont mind an R rating, i suggest that you see this movie as quickly as possible.Go!! Hurry up!!! Go see it right now!!!!!!!!!!
B00005RHGK|5.0|Great movie!  One of the best!  I don't care what the spoiled film brats say, it is a teriffic movie.

They have taken a great movie, and put it on a great DVD.  The picture and sound quality are pretty good.  I also recommend you get the album for Bennett Salvay's original score.  This movie, although given a lot of disrespect by fans of the genre, deserved the treatment!
B00000JY1X|5.0|What a delight to find such great lyrics - and so many songs in one package.  Definitely the best of 2001.<BR>I particularly liked 'Reno Dakota' but at least 60 of the 69 songs are winners.
B000051VWW|4.0|First of all I have to say that SADE is my favorite artist.  PERIOD. <br />However, I do feel that so much of the ROOT sound of SADE as a group was missing in this CD. With previous CDs, each CD took you to another level of appreciation of how she and the group could somehow transport you with their music, skillfully fusing the various real instruments with her unbelievable voice.  Its this sound that made us fans feel like we had been transported to exactly where she was. Sometimes another setting, sometimes another mindset.<br />For me, its not about wanting her to sound the same and clone each album.  I understand that its like knowing a good friend (through her music and lyrics that she wrote and produced) and after an 8 year absence there will be considerable change.  I didn't expect her to be the same, but I feel that this album came down to everyone else's level as far as artistically in the majority of its tracks. <br />I will say that &quot;King of Sorrow&quot; I did absolutely love and no one else could have sung that song with the same type of subtle, matter-of-fact, yet passionate conviction that was in her voice. It was as if she spontaneously sung her thoughts out loud when she recorded that. &quot;Somebody Already Broke My Heart&quot; had a hint of the Sade root sounds with the violin strings bursting in for their remarkable effect like they did in some of her earlier work. Although I am a HUGE fan of what I recognized as slight Jamaican and hip-hop influences in some of her songs, I have to admit that I missed some of the more Latin influenced R&amp;B that seemed to be the root of her earlier work. But I guess that work reflected more of the time in her life when she lived in Spain.<br />Previously, SADE as a group was hard to put in a R&amp;B or Smooth Jazz box, they were what I then considered Alternative R&amp;B, but I think this latest release can definitely be classified as R&amp;B with Hop-Hop influences. Not that that is bad, its just that shehas no need to come down to everyone else's level when they still have yet to get up to hers.  <br />**A true SADE fan will not have to review anyones else's opinions in order to decide whether or not to purchase this CD.  A true fan will already have the CD, just because its another stage in a friend's life that they wouldn't want to miss out on.

B00005JSGK|2.0|the animals or the veldt.<br />I usually like John Wayne movies, and I bought Hatari! because I thought I remembered watching it as a kid.  I'm certain I did see it, but my positive memories were some sort of temporary mental abberation--and I didn't see the whole thing.<br />I'm definitely not an &quot;animal-rights activist&quot; (mmmm, beef), but watching this movie makes me want to contribute to PETA or Sierra Club or something; it's a real shame to see people chasing after animals in jeeps.  The humor is tired and worn, and I don't think I've seen so much smoking in a movie since The Towering Inferno. (It appears to me the movie's been sponsored by the tobacco and African safari companies.)<br />On a moral scale, I'll give the movie 5 points for saving baby elephants and a big -500 for the various jeep-chasing scenes...no point in mentioning the poor monkeys.<br />I'd have a hard time recommending this one.  It's slightly better than Donovan's Reef, but only because of the goofy rocket bit and the music.  There are many better John Wayne films, and tons of better movies in general.
0385505833|5.0|I got this book because I loved the jacket.  My copy has a Christmas tree on it, red background.  Anyway, I was so intrigued with how this couple would accomplish skipping Christmas that I didn't stop until I finished the entire book.  Well okay, it took me two days to finish it because it was at the height of Christmas when I read it.  It was a relax read and I had a good couple of laughs.  I guess that's what I needed to relax and feel Christmas... and realized that Christmas should never be skipped... ever.<br />I've recommended this book to my friends and told them not to expect the typical Grisham book.  It's light... a perfect breather from our busy lives.
6304178352|1.0|Who's the REAL Eliza? Shout it out now: JULIE! JULIE! JULIE!<br />&quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. Thats all one needs to say to get the attention of millions. But who is locked in the public's mind as Eliza Dootlittle?: Dame Julie Andrews. Deservedly so. She took Broadway by storm in My Fair Lady. Making covers of &quot;Life&quot; Magazine and more in 1956 etc. No one-and i mean no one (that includes Audrey Hepburn) should have been allowed to destory the Eliza that Julie created. Jack Warner destroyed Eliza buy hiring Audrey Hepburn. Ofcourse we all know it didnt hurt Ms. Andrews' career. She got a LITTLE gig called &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;...I'm sure NONE OF YOU have heard of it, right? And then a tiny little thing called &quot;the sound of music&quot; only the most popular movie of all time. AND she got her Oscar for Best Actress for Mary Poppins. Go, Julie! She showed them. Even Jack Warner admitted that he voted for Julie Andrews in the Academy Awards. ANd It has been said by MORE than a few that &quot;passing up Julie Andrews for Eliza ruined Jack's career and was the worst move he ever made&quot;. Audrey Hepburn was a terribly weak Eliza Doolittle. And thet world knows it--come on, admit it. Most of you have heard the Julie Andrews version from the my fair lady broadway cd 9or the lndon cast, ms. andrews did both) and it is SO true that she was much better. her accent is way believable. ANd her singing voice is unmatchable. (four and a half octaves--which is more than i can say about Audrey's dubber Marni Nixon). Well, Rex Harrison was wonderful on the upside. He pleaded with Jack Warner to use Julie. But, now that i think of it no one &quot;uses&quot; MY julie. They can &quot;use&quot; her talent, yes. of which she has much. but julie makes her own desicions. and when jack warner asked her to reprise her Broadway role of Guenvere in the movie version Camelot, after a long process of thought (and because Richard Burton and Robert Goulet, who lpayed oppisite her onBroadway had both declinded) she said &quot;No.&quot; GO, Julie! Atleast Jack had the sense to ask the real Queen to be the queen in his movie. I guess he didn't wanna make the mistake he made with my fair lady again, huh? Yup.<br />If we were in 1964 right now. If i were to go back in time. I would have barged into jack's office and screamed my lungs out until he promised to fire Audrey. :) innocent little me. but it is well known that Julie's career outlasted Audrey's. Yup-yup. For Julie is still decking out major movie hits as we speak--and Audrey well, I loved her in &quot;Breakfast At Tiffany's&quot; and may she rest in peace. From what i know, which is a lot when it comes to julie andrews, Audrey and Julie got along famously. Now dont get me wrong. I dont HATE Audrey, she was just very wro0ng for the part. I like Audrey very much. not NEARLY as much as i love julie andrews but...i think the world agrees when i say that its much easier to fall in love with mary poppins than holly goliightly whom ONLY &quot;Fred&quot; REALLY loved with all his heart. Julie just has that efffect on people that audrey doesnt possess. well, we cant have it all can we? We've got &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; and &quot;The Sound Of Music&quot; so soften the blow. If Julie had done My Fair lady, she WOULD have been able to do Mary Poppins but she WOULDNT have been able to do &quot;The Americanization Of Emily&quot; or &quot;The Sound Of Music&quot;. and let's face it, Can anyone here actually imagine &quot;The Sound Of Music&quot; with anyone BUT Julie ANdrews? Honestly, no. Toodles and Long Live Queen Julie Andrews!'<br />~*~*~*Julie Andrews Always,~*~*~*~ Skye
B00004RFFI|1.0|There are movies that can be carried by special effects or star power in the absence of good direction/script/SUBSTANCE.  Twister wasn't one of them.  Star Wars Episode 1 and Final Fantasy at least had great eye candy to distract you from the fact that the movie itself was really weak.  Twister had... CG flying dirt.  That combined with one of the most obstinately dumb scripts I've seen outside of MST3K adds up to a movie that I'd sooner drink sour milk than see again.<br />Unless Mike/Joel and the 'bots were sitting in the front row.
B00005R87Q|4.0|(...). It's not \\"The Road Warrior\\" either, but it's the closest thing to it within (almost) the last 20 years in regards to providing the same high-octane thrills as derived from that ultimate 20th Century form of human self-expression, the severely customized automobile.<br />><br />Paul Walker (who looks like a cross between C. Thomas Howell and Timothy Hutton, but maybe I'm dating myself here a bit) and Vin Diesel's relationship make what has been routinely slagged off as a \\"Donnie Brasco re-telling\\" a lot more interesting than just some dialogue in between stunt driving scenes (said stunt driving scenes in themselves are worth the price of ownership, however). An empathy for both characters develops without the viewer even being aware of it...the result is a series of plot twists and something of a surprise ending that leaves the door open for...yes, a sequel franchise. Couldn't you just see it coming?<br />><br />Maybe the first decade of the 21st Century will compete with the 1970's for the right to be remembered as \\"The Golden Age of Car movies\\". There are enough homages to prior films (adequately covered in Rob Cohen's fantastic commentary track) to suggest that this movie was more than just an exploitation flick for motorheads...it comes across as a director's labor of love. Seriously.<br />><br />Oh, and with a nod of respect I personally appreciated all that much more, the \\"baddest ride\\" in this video showroom of vehicular art IS a relic from the Age of Muscle Cars (and Steve McQueen's \\"Bullitt\\"), the manliest car ever built, the Dodge Charger R/T, including (if the gods are kind) the supercharged 426 hemi. Can I get an \\"AMEN\\" (or at least a \\"HOO-WAH\\")?
B000055Y0X|5.0|There aren't many comedy films that stand up to repeat viewing and even less that get better the more you see them. \\"Some Like It Hot\\" (justifiably voted the funniest movie of all time) is one and \\"Dr Strangelove\\" comes in a close second. The acting is superb, with Peter Sellers' three character \\"tour de force\\" & George C. Scott's performances ranking up there with the very best, the cinematography is brilliant, generating real tension through clever cutting and the use of hand-held sequences, and the essentially horrific storyline is tight, believable & wholly effective. The verbal and visual gags flow thick and fast and the last scene's chillingly languid marriage of Vera Lynn's nostalgic wartime anthem \\"We'll Meet Again\\" with repeated nuclear explosions perfectly reflects what has gone before: satirical black comedy at its most inspired. And... to cap it all, the theatre trailer on this DVD version is a small, perfectly formed cinematic gem in itself.
0792841344|5.0|This spine chiller will give you shivers like you never thought you could get. Don Coscarelli has created a backdrop for one of the scariest series ever, using the meager means of a low budget seventies production.

B00000INEX|5.0|My son is so enchanted by their videos, he has to sleep with one of the video boxes every night (we own allt heir videos, toys, etc.).  He will be turning two, and already knows some Japanese, Spanish and Russian, and can actually read some words.  I use these videos as reinforcements for my teachings to him, but they also supply INCREDIBLE entertainment if I need to take a quick shower or write an email or cook.  Absolutely the highest recommendation from the pickiest of parents!
B00000JG4N|5.0|In The Crue's auobiography &quot;The Dirt&quot;, Vince Neil writes that no one goes to a Motley Crue concert expecting a really heavy, thought-provoking experience...people go to a Motley Crue concert hoping to get a (session of oral pleasure) in the back seat of a car.<br />&gt;<br />These guys made a career out of making music suited to just such a purpose, and they never did it as well as on this CD.  The yardstick to whether a strip club is any good can STILL be determined by the number of Motley Crue songs you hear within the first hour (if it's less than two, you probably don't really want to be there).<br />&gt;<br />So, to &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot;, then...Title track:  Some seriously heavy &quot;dropped-D&quot; tuning (this is used a lot on this CD...Soundgarden gets most recognition for it, but The Crue had 'em beat by years) and one of Tommy Lee's best-ever drum tracks.<br />&gt;<br />&quot;Slice Of Your Pie&quot;:  My favorite track...psychedelic intro and an homage to Steven Tyler in the credits for the drum track (likely to keep from getting sued...it does sound a helluva lot like &quot;Rag Doll&quot;)...and the fade-out pays a solid tribute to The Beatles &quot;I Want You (She's So Heavy)&quot;.  if you're gonna rip someone off, you could do a lot worse than Lennon-McCartney.<br />&gt;<br />&quot;Rattlesnake Shake&quot;:  More latter-day L.A. glam-funk influence with a cool horn section and a nice bass break by Nikki Sixx (sobering up DEFINITELY was worth it as far as his playing goes).<br />&gt;<br />&quot;Kickstart My Heart&quot;:  Adrenaline personified.  Not my favorite (MTV played this video WAY too much), but a Crue staple.<br />&gt;<br />&quot;Without You&quot;:  My personal favorite &quot;power ballad&quot; from a time when all metal acts were required to record at least one (except for Aerosmith, who don't seem to record anything else).

B00005RHGK|2.0|What a hype machine this is. Its been hailed as the return of Horror movie monsters to scary films. Those who hated the &quot;mock&quot; horror films such as Scream and company, claim this movie as the big horror come back. Someone even said this movie isn't a satire, if thats true, why does the girl say &quot;you know that part in horror movies when someone does somethign really stupid and everyone hates him for it, this is it&quot; Could you be anymore obvious and self-knowing? That line alone, totally blows whatever fictional world they want you in. From that moment on you KNOW this will be nothing more then typical horror dribble.<br />The Creeper is NOT scary, not even that ugly. His form is just not surprising, and falls short of a vampire bat wannabe.<br />The kill scenes are non-existant with little to no blood. Theirs no psychological thrills because everything is painted right in front of you. The use of the song is silly but serves some kinda purpose but holds no candle to freddy's song. <br />The characters are acted as well as they can be, but they have nothing to work with. All they do is run and get scared. Its so short that literally by the end, not much of anything has happened. <br />Don't waste your time, if you hated Scream (I luved it) please don't say THIS is better. <br />The Ending is different and can be applauded for its no-holds-barred approach, but by then you just wanna turn off the movie.
B00003CX5P|1.0|I saw it in theatres and it made me laugh... not a good laugh either.  Jar-Jar Binks is the worst screen character, digital or otherwise, to have ever been created.  Stan Winston's gnome in &quot;A Gnome Named Gnorm&quot; is the only character that I have ever seen that comes close to Jar-Jar in annoyance.  The kid (Annakin) can't act, and Lucas can't direct.  Visuals are good, but overrated.  Good actors (Portman, McGregor, and Neeson) flounder under Lucas' direction.  The story is great on paper.
B0000057C5|5.0|Sehnsucht means lonliness in German, and it is also the title of a piece of music by Schumann arranged for male voices previously recorded by the University of Michigan Men's Glee Club. Did anyone know that other than me? no, but this CD is the best rammstein CD, go buy they and slay, virtually I mean.
B00003CXDZ|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, but it was not one you could watch while doing 5 other things.  I sat down ready to watch a good movie and I was not disappointed.  It was in no way what I was expecting but I found myself laughing and amazed at the way the most appropriate songs were thrown in at the most appropriate time.  My husband could not get into the movie for anything, he's not into the singing/dancing type thing.
B00005RHGL|4.0|Well, I haven't gotten this yet, but I did pre-order it and it appears that I will be getting it on its release date.<br />I have been wanting a Widescreen version of this film every since it was released on VHS many years ago.  Now that I have DVD and have learned that the original DVD version of this film was lacking, I am glad that it is now in a Vista Series director's cut  format with all the additional extras.  Can't wait to check it out next Tuesday.<br />I always loved the personal conflict between Doc Holiday and the Michael Biehn character (sorry forgot the character name).  &quot;I'm your Huckleberry.&quot;<br />Plus now we get a 134 minute director's cut version that hopefully includes some more gunfight scenes or something.
B00000295A|5.0|This jamiroquai album is probably their best. I own all of their CD's and this one has more funk, jive and groove. Perfect to drive, work, or dance to.
B00005TT77|2.0|of any c.d. coming out in the last while, I thought this one would be the best. As others have said, the artists stay close to the original for the most part. This is my problem. <BR>The Beatles genius was in the creation of the music, not in the technical ability to play it. So , if you're not going to find an interesting spin on a particular song, I really don't see the point.[unless your are in a bar band]<BR>It's funny , but I purchased the McCartney tribute a few weeks ago , expecting the worst. What a surprise. Refreshing, passionate, innovative takes of his songs.<BR>I find the Lennon tracks harder to cover than the McCartney. The Lennon tracks seem to need HIS voice and magic. McCartney's tracks are more musical, and seem to be more easily covered. I really like Blackbird and Mother Natures Son. Great vocals really work here. <BR>I thought Eddie Vedder's cover was weak. I mean , I could have submitted that track with my limited musical ability and vocal range.<BR>You want to hear an interesting cover of something by a Beatle[or ex Beatle] check out Coming Up, Junk or Maybe I'm Amazed on the McCartney tribute album.
B00000J2KX|5.0|A most-see-and-collect movie.<BR>On of the best horror movie ever made.
0792844793|5.0|'Blue Velvet' is a Douglas Sirk melodrama recast as a Surrealist film noir.  I had thought that the film might have dated, that David Lynch's bugs-beneath-the-smiling-small-town-facade worldview had long since passed into self-parody, but Lynch was never much interested in social criticism.  What may be fascistic violence, misogyny and abuse of physical vulnerability in the film's surface crime narrative becomes liberating when seen in its true dream colours, as elements of the hero's unconscious.  The film begins with the hero's father, connected to candy-coloured images of suburban, robotic conformity, suffering from a stroke.  Freed from this paternal authority, Jeffrey begins exploring the dreamscape of his own desires, falling for women under male control (trying to assert Oedipal primacy), testing various kinds of sexual experience, facing a world of metamorphosing identities and locations.  This only remains possible so long as his father is in a coma - once he resumes control, the deviant can be suppressed, and automated complacency restored.<br />'Velvet' is a frightening but hilarious black comedy - from the dog gulping hose water over a stroke victim (a different - or related? - kind of unconscious) to earnest medical discussions about a severed ear to Dennis Hopper's pre-camp violence to Isabella Rossellini's 'Bride of Frankenstein' strapping to an ambulance stretcher.  Andre Breton once defined black humour as the key Surrealist characteristic, and 'Velvet' is, after 'Vertigo', the greatest Surrealist film of the American cinema, from its interior spaces evoking the paintings of de Chirico and Magritte, and the dream-imagery of corridors, stairs and doors (as portals to another world; as embodiments of (female) sexuality, especially Dorothy's bathroom and her urethral nightclub stage) to the dream-logic of the plot, with its emphasis on the nocturnal; on unconscious walking; on repetition; on the fetishised focus on items of clothing, lips, colours etc.; on the existence of various worlds in a circumscribed space, like the conflicting desires in our mind.<br />'Velvet' is Lynch's most successful film because it is structured by genre.  At one point Sandy asks Jeffrey whether he is a detective or a pervert; both types are defined as voyeurs.  Jeffrey belongs to the great tradition of anti-detectives headed by 'Vertigo''s Scottie Ferguson, men who believe they are solving a crime in the external world, but are really getting lost in their own mind.  The detective might seem to be the 'reality principle' opposed to the liberation of Surrealism, but there are points in common - the interpretation of visual clues, the search for an elusive ojbect, the playing with time and space.  Ultimately, however, the restitution of order must mean death to Dream and Desire.  <br />What makes 'Velvet' more successful than most Surrealist films is character - although Frank (surely an outcast from Celine, or the Wizard in this twisted return to Oz?) and the rest are figments of Jeffrey's unconscious, they are fully-formed and compelling in their own right.  Lynch's visuals are so unforgettable and potent, it is easy to overlook the unnerving genius of his sound-designs, the hyper-reality of 'real' or background sound, the menacing atmospherics and Hollywood pastiche in Badalamenti's score or the brilliantly destabilising use of familiar pop standards.  'Velvet' was the first 'serious' film I ever saw - looking back at it over a decade later, I hadn't realised how much it had infiltrated my own unconscious and private mythology.
B000002UVX|5.0|What this album lacks in # of tracks, it certainly makes up for in the awesome mind-blowing blues rythem and timing of this amazing trio.  This is my favorite off all my Hendrix Albums, Jimi just seems more relaxed, he is able to flow; and you can sense it in his music.  You can relly feel the music, it makes you wanna just start freaking out.  Hendrix has done it again.  <br />Stay Free...
B00004Z459|5.0|I love all types of music, but I am a huge rock fan.  When I got Linkin Park's cd, it never left my cd player.  EVERY track on the cd is amazing.  Plus, it keeps me pumped while I'm working out.  Do yourself a favor, and check this one out.
B000056NX5|3.0|It's nice to have a Dolby 5.1 soundtrack, and the cinematography and visual aspects of the sets and actors is good overall, but almost all of the performers are pretty weak in either the ability or motivation to vocalize their parts well.  It's worth buying if you're a JCS fan, but if you don't have a JCS DVD/tape yet I'd find a community theater playing it and go see it in person.  The little group I saw in Buffalo a few years back had more singing talent than the people in this production.   The older DVD isn't bad either, I'd rank it slightly above this one overall.
B000002AS3|5.0|In short, this is rock.<br />Oasis didn't rise to fame because of their pretense and troubles in the press-- they are superstars because they have what rock and roll needs: beautiful emotionally-sung words set to beautiful guitars.<br />This and 'Morning Glory' are excellent. I am reminded of T. Rex, Big Star or early Kinks. They have drop-dead gorgeous throwaway lyrics and perfect little guitar tunes that won't leave your head.<br />If you consider yourself a rock fan, do yourself a favor and get a copy. It's bloody excellent.
0385505833|3.0|Why was this ever a book?  Grisham should have not published this but instead skipped straight to making this a TV movie.  It had no depth but had a lot visual comedy that would look good on screen.
B00005QXDD|5.0|I have been a fan of Tenacious D for a few years now and I must say that this album is a step in the right direction from their live act.  While nothing can replace the unforgivable error of not including Sasquatch, Jesus Ranch or Bowie on this recording, it is still worth the money for the glorious rock that bleeds from their souls like wine.  Every note of their music is carefully placed so as to increase the total amount of rocking possible.  The consensus amongst my friends is that \\"Wonderboy\\" is officially the greatest rock song of all time, closely beating out \\"Stairway to Heaven\\"  That's how good this album is!  So, buy this album and find some of their bootleg live shows.  Study their every detail so that when your children in the near distant future comes home from school, you'll be able to talk with them about the \\"D\\" and even read over the multiple chapters about them in your child's history books!
B000002OR4|5.0|This soundtrack has to be one of the best I've ever heard. It's so sweetly sad...there's really nothing that equals it in true pathos. And with Itzhak Perlman playing the solos, and John Williams composing it's no wonder. As a violinist, I have learned the main theme and &quot;Remberances.&quot; I know I can never match Perlman's playing, but it helps bring the feeling closer. This is a must-buy for any violinist or music-lover!!!
B00005U2LM|5.0|Seems to me that both Nas and Wu needed to get back to the greatness of 94.  Nas failed miserably with an album that is rife with contradictions (act like a thug on one track and then a prophet on the other.  Kissing pac and biggies ass even though while they were alive it was a different matter).<br />Wu-on the other hand-hit a home run here.  They take the stance that so many in their positions are afraid to, Pro America.  They support the country that has made them millionaires, and they have done it while returning to the style that made 36 chambers so great.  Dope hooks, philosophical yet rugged content, and of course the type of energy that is normally found only in the underground (y@kballs, Arsonists, J-Zone).   Buy this album, and leave Nas alone.
B00005N83M|5.0|Jlo is really great, and this album just blew me out of my chair!Parents, don't be so overprotected of your kids. I think that it is great. aside from the 'mother ...' part of play, the only song you gotta watch out for in this album is Come Over. Much *sexual content* and Secretly is a sweet song and isn't very sexual. Here is a full review of the album:<br />Love Don't Cost A Thing - very good song, very good message<BR>I'm Real - excellent! not my favorite though<BR>Play - this song is danceable and fun<BR>Walking on Sunshine - welcome to Neverland! very imaginable, and very mature<BR>Ain't it Funny - the best song on this album tied with....<BR>Carino - they are both so excellent! Carino and Ain't it Funny are singable, danceable, and have a very sugary spanish sound! Loving them!<BR>Come Over - Nothing against the song, just a little over the top.<BR>We Gotta Talk - I can never remember the lyrics to the song. It's a bit boring. <BR>That's Not Me - WARNING! THIS SONG WILL GET YOU IN A WONDERFUL CONFIDENT MOOD SO PREPARE TO LIKE THIS!!!!!<BR>Dance with Me - a little bit of the same boring ;tip toe; sound here.<BR>Secretly - very very sweetly edited!<BR>I'm Gonna Be alright - this song is cool!<BR>That's the way - alright....<BR>Dame (touch me) - ugh, not my type!<BR>Si Ya Se Acabo - this is not really my type either, but it's fun to dance to. Just not my signiture is all.<BR>I'm Real Murder Remix - Jlo, what were you thinking?? this remix ...!<br />overall, wonderful work. If you like this, I would reccomend Britney Spears very highly. BRITNEY ROCKS AND I LOVE HER WITH ALL MY HEART!!!
B000006JQ5|5.0|This double CD is an excellent compilation of the things that Iron Maiden did from 1978 to 1996. It contains very good material from all their albums, the CD artwork is excellent and it has the lyrics from all the songs there. I think that true fans maybe disappointed for the omission of \\"Flight Of Icarus\\", \\"Revelations\\", \\"Infinite Dreams\\", \\"Killers\\", among others, but people new to Maiden will really enjoy this magnificent compendium of songs.<br />My favorite songs are here, including the epic \\"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner (Live)\\", \\"Aces High\\" and Di'Anno's years masterpiece: \\"Phantom Of The Opera\\". \\"The Trooper\\" stands out along with \\"The Number Of The Beast\\". The \\"Running Free\\" live cut is awesome, even better than the original one (Bruce proves that he is an excellent singer on stage).<br />The 90's stuff has a lot of power on it. \\"Be Quick Or Be Dead\\" is a true Maiden song and \\"Fear Of The Dark\\" was recorded with an audience that the band hardly will never forget.<br />The Bayley's songs are outstandings. They show the full writing ability of the band on \\"Virus\\" and Harris's supremacy on \\"Sign Of The Cross\\".<br />This CD is a sample of some of the best Maiden songs ever, despite several tracks missing, such as: \\"Children Of The Damned\\", and the aforementioned ones.<br />It's a shame that this CD is out of print. However, try to get the live albums for a true Maiden experience. \\"Live After Death\\" and \\"Rock In Rio\\" are just OK!
B00005RFAI|2.0|It doesn't suck. I think that Pink is pretty cool and I love her philosophy and the fact that she loves Britney Spears and N'sync, the best people around! I also love her song 'Get the Party Started' it is cool, but overall I wouldn't buy the album. I know she doesn't think she's pretty but she is. I don't totally hate it. It's okay.
B000003S0F|4.0|In contrast the synth-infused, electric ambience of their progrock peers, King Crimson created a distinctly organic sound on 1971's Islands. Founding members and general KC conceptualizers, Robert Fripp (guitar) and Pete Sinfield (lyrics) lead newcomers Boz Burrell (bass, vocals), Mel Collins (flute) and Ian Wallace (spectacular percussion) through a lush, hypnotic, dreary, classical-infused wash of sound. Throughout the easy-flowing arrangements, the band melts together splendidly. From  Mr. Sinfield's pagan-inspired lyrics to  Mr. Burrell's sensual vocals to  Mr. Collin's gentle flute and so on, each member seems to compliment the other. Specifically on the jangley &quot;Formentera Lady&quot; and the dreamy &quot;Ladies of the Road,&quot; they sound like one beast with many hands. It is surprising and unfortunate that they were a one-time-only fixture. Together they produced a finely crafted, gently invigorating work that stands as Crimson's must subtle albums and also one of their best. There was no need for a sonic assault here. Islands contains the kind of musical power that is gently inhaled by the listener then intoxicates him or her.
B000056K04|4.0|by no means have they.<br />Still not quite sure what all the hub-bub was about with the first single off this &quot;I Did It&quot;, what's the problem?<br />So, I adore  this CD, but I adore Dave Matthews.  All of the tracks are what you would expect from this caliber of a band and songwriter but in my opinion, &quot;When The World Ends&quot; is an amazing song.  It's slightly different than what you are used to and the lyrical delivery (not to mention the lyrics themselves) are breathtaking..I don't mean breathtaking in a &quot;classical sense&quot; more like...did he say that? and..would he please say it again.  Girls, you know what I mean!!<br />I still prefer the Under The Table Dreaming which is on my top 10 CD list of all time but this one comes close, better than Crash in my opinion. <br />The thing about Dave is, he just can't go wrong.  Very talented along with the rest of the band.  Unlike the Grateful Dead, there is a reason this guy has a strong following of fans. Buy it..you'll like it.
B00000634J|5.0|If you ask me, the golden age of rock and roll started in 1965 when Bob Dylan went electric on Bringing It All Back Home and the Beatles expanded their sound on Rubber Soul and ended in 1980, when Led Zeppelin broke-up and John Lennon passed on. While Zeppelin kept hard rock ablaze after Cream, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix and the Doors all became history, Mr. Lennon kept rock's intellectual nature alive after the burnout or shift in focus of various 60s songwriters. Mr. Lennon's solo songs meant so much to rock music. He was the first songwriter to so fearlessly dive into the grimiest of social and personal issues on tracks like \\"Mother,\\" \\"Working Class Hero\\" and \\"Cold Turkey.\\" With songs such as \\"Imagine,\\" \\"Instant Karma,\\" \\"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\\" and \\"Power to the People\\" he set the tone for the genre's sense of idealism after the dissolution of the hippie dream. Latter classics such as \\"(Just Like) Starting Over,\\" \\"Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)\\" and \\"Nobody Told Me\\" showed that rock could settle into middle age with dignity and vitality. When Mr. Lennon was tragically murdered in December of 1980, the very soul of rock music was lost forever just as its sparkling fierceness never fully survived Led Zeppelin's break up in the same month (Listen to a majority of 80s metal for confirmation). There have been enjoyable moments since (I thoroughly enjoyed the rise of alternative rock and the reformation of the careers of Leonard Cohen, Neil Young and Bob Dylan), yet the fire of rock and roll was never more alive and the possibilities never seemed as endless as they did during those glorious sixteen years. Lennon Legend is an excellent collection of some of the most wonderful contributions John Lennon, as a solo artist, added to that magical era.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I must confess that i like the music of No doubt,this cd rocks, is simply the best, its even better than Tragic Kingdom and Return of Saturn, Gwens voice sounds really good, all the songs are great specially Hella Good, Hey baby, Making out, Detective, Dont let me down, start the fire and Rock steady, AWESOME.
B0000009SG|1.0|I bought Overnight Sensation under the impression that Frank Zappa was a witty satirist and an outstanding experimental guitarist. Only one song (&quot;I'm the Slime&quot;) even relatively meets his reputation. The rest of the album consists of trashy, unamusing novelty songs (&quot;Dinah-Moe Hum&quot; &quot;Dirty Love&quot;) or tracks too senseless to even warrant that modest title (&quot;Fifty-Fifty&quot; &quot;Montana&quot;). The guitar-playing is sublime, laid-back and funky. Unlike the songwriting, it is acceptable, but nothing any two-bit hack, leftover from the psychedelic movement could not do. Did I buy the wrong album? Is Mr. Zappa really that overrated?
1572510714|5.0|This book is deep, as expected. Some of the reviewers claim it to be a bad book, but they don't explain why they believe this book to be bad, they only mention that it was confusing. Like anyother good quality book, theater, music, or painting, this one is complicated. If it was obvious and simple, than it would not be brilliant, but common. It is ok for people not to enjoy this book, as long as they have understood it entirely and are able to explain their criticism. For those who hate it for the simple fact that it is confusing, I recommend these people to re-read it and be focused. This is no Judy Blume book. This is more like a book by Kafka, where you have to sit back and take the story to another level and not just look at it superficially. <BR>What I most found amazing about Vonnegart is that he is able to write an anti-war book like no other man has. For instance, if you get JOHNNY GOT HIS GUN which I particularly enjoyed, the book has a a morbid, enraged, and sad tone and mood. Vonnegart does the contrary. Instead of describing a sad, violent, and unfair event with the obvious emotions that he felt, he chooses to describe the bombing of Dresden with sarcasm and humour. Interestingly enough, his humour has a much bigger effect on the reader. When he talks about being unstuck in time, he is basically saying that the events that occurred during the war still lives in his mind. The Tralfolmadorians are really one of the best things Vonnegart has added to his book. The symbolism is great. I will not say my interpretation of them because that might interfere and ruin it for others. That is all I have to say, this is an amazing book and everyone should read it. If you have not understood it, read it again. It is worthwhile.<BR>What is there to say about a massacre but &quot;Pooteeweet?&quot;...Vonnegart is simply brilliant.
B00005AFMT|4.0|King Crimson blasted onto the music scene in 1969, jumpstarting progressive rock. The band lead a legion of rockers who were more interested in engaging in wild experimentation than bopping along in the three-minute pop song format and whose nights were more likely spent in the library than the juke joint. Crimson's leader, guitarist, Robert Fripp, however, grew tired of the movement that had branched from his band and disbanded King Crimson in 1974, exclaiming his disdain for the pomposity and indulgence in clich&eacute;s that had infiltrated much of progressive rock. Seven years later, Mr. Fripp presented a new King Crimson line-up, including long-time drummer, Bill Bruford and commended session musicians, guitarist/vocalist, Adrian Belew, and bass-player, Tony Levin, with 1981's Discipline.<br />The LP stayed true to Mr. Fripp's verdict about progrock, even dodging many of the formulas that Crimson, itself, had pioneered. The band was restarted from scratch. Gone is the influence of classical music; gone is the epic sense of enormity and gone are the cosmic themed lyrics. Instead, the 80s-era King Crimson was defined by a wavy, self-possessed arrangements, Talking Heads-ish funkrock and Mr. Belew's slyly neurotic rants.<br />On tracks like \\"Elephant Talk,\\" \\"Frame by Frame\\" and the simply gorgeous \\"Matte Kudiasi,\\" Mr. Fripp and Mr. Belew engage in beautiful, subtle, fluid guitar-interplay. On \\"Indiscipline\\" and \\"Thela Hun Ginjeet,\\" Belew employs a theatrical, distraught, hair-ripping persona. Both songs are exceptional. Two of the most memorable moments in Crimson's recording history are the rickety game of call and answer between the swirling arrangemebts and Mr. Belew's yowls on \\"Indiscipline\\" and the hilarious spoken word section of  \\"Thela Hun Ginjeet.\\" The album closes with two instrumentals, the imminent, easy-flowing \\"The Sheltering Sky\\" and the all-out groove of the title track. Throughout Discipline, a genuine air of experimentation and inspiration permeates as King Crimson explores new ways to look at oddball rock.
B00004U28G|4.0|Cannonball Run is a guilty pleasure.  No one would ever say it's a good movie, but it's a like train wreck, you find yourself staring.   Burt Reynolds tries to live his glory days of Smokey and The Bandit, bringing along the same Director, Hal Needham as well as a slew of falling stars to prop him up.  Its as if all of them knew their careers were sliding and it was one last ditch effort to make a great noise.  Don't get me wrong, many of these people are talented.  Lets explain the premise first.  The 'Run' is an auto street (or highway) race, based closely on a real race that was run throughout the 70s that went from New York to California.  It was highly illegal, and probably a lot a fun.  There is even an appearance by one of the original drivers, Brock Yates, who is now an editor for Car &amp; Driver Magazine and makes an amusing appearance as the MC, explaining how the race goes.  Reynolds is JJ McClure, a former race car driver and mechanic who is the standing champ in the race.  Eager to keep his title, he is desperate to win again.  In this race though, that doesn't just mean going fast, anyone can go fast, but sooner or later, you will get stopped.  JJ and his strange friend, Victor (Dom Delouse) adopt a personality of two paramedics driving a patient cross country.  Apparently this worked in the actual race one year.  The supporting cast of competition includes Jamie Farr as an overzealous Sheik in a hopped up Rolls Royce, Roger Moore playing a comic version of his James Bond character driving his popular silver Austin Martin, Mel Tillus and Terry Bradshaw playing a couple of southern boys cruising in a stolen race car and my personal favorite, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. playing womanizing, gambling hard drinking priests driving a red Ferrari (they aren't really priests).   All this adds up to a movie where every scene you see a star.  Dean and Sammy steal the show in almost every scene they're in, they are class acts adding something unattainable inmost pictures of this caliber.  The racing antics are not quite as funny as the beginning scenes where all the characters are introduced, but it is entertaining.  The best part of the movie comes at the end though where the bloopers are shown during the closing credits.  It's worth the price of the DVD alone.  Don't expect a great movie out of Cannonball Run, all you can really expect is a good time, but isn't that what it's all about?
B000002UA5|5.0|Pink Floyd's collossal ability is showcased here, on this phenomenal double album. As a musical statement, it is often misunderstood, but it's brilliance lies in its striking originality. At just over 86 minutes long Ummagumma is the Floyd's unique exposition on the capabilities of experimental music. It consists of one live disc and one studio disc. The live album blows away all competition in a dazzeling explosion of glorious space rock-Pink Floyd style. The studio album allows each member to record individually. The results reveal deep talent and imagination and it's a shame that so few people bother to listen to it.<BR>The live album is just too cool not to be Floyd. The four tracks, extended versions of \\"Astronomy Domine\\", \\"Careful with that Axe, Eugene\\", \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\" and \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\", all achieve such incredible sonic depth that it's difficult to imagine that sound coming from any physical object or being. Few bands had the intuitive chemistry of the Pink Floyd and, in my humble opinion, none had the composing ability or distinctive sound. In all honesty, the Who were probably THE greatest live band of all time, but my personal preference is for the Floyd (but I still think \\"The Who Live at Leeds\\" is the ultimate live rock'n'roll album).<BR>The Floyd's brand of psychedelic jamming is unique and these live cuts are a treat for the enlightened listener's ears. The instruments are at one with the muscicians and the musicians are at one with each other. Roger contributes pulsating bass, hearty whacks to a gong and some terrifying screams. His whispered vocals on \\"Set the controls...\\" are suitably mysterious. Dave goes at his guitar like a demon and his wordless vocals on \\"Saucerful...\\" are exceptional. Rick's keyboards, both the sinister soloing and the shimmering chords, are integral to the sound and Nick lays down more dynamic grooves than you'd think possible in just four numbers. The track selection is faultless (notthat they were spoilt for choice at this stage in their career!). \\"Astronomy Domine\\" is the perfect opener, with its many explosive climaxes. Daves guitar seems to roar gently inbetween notes but there is nothing gentle about his playing on the fearsome \\"Eugene\\", where his wall-of-sound approach, which kicks in after Roger's famous scream, consists mainly of menacing powerchords, punctuated by high-pitched feedback shrieks. The hypnotic dirge, \\"Set the controls...\\" builds up to a frenzied clatter of drums and various edge-of-the-universe sounds. Then the band treat us to a truly memorable rendition of \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\". It begins with the sombre bass and organ soundscape of the first movement (titled \\"something else\\") before the first glass-splintering organ licks signal the start of the chaotic second movement (aptly titled \\"syncopated pandamonium\\"). The third movement, \\"storm signal\\", is dominated by Nick's insistent drum pattern. The final movement, \\"Celestial voices\\", is a beautiful dreamscape that lifts the soul with a sensational mixture of drums, bass, organ, guitar and soulful wailing. This is the pure undiluted sound of Pink Floyd putting all of their effort into making music and never bothering with a lyric when a murderous scream will do.<BR>On the studio album, each member does his own thing, sometimes to jaw-dropping effect. At other times they are content to merely make the listener aware that some sounds exist that nobody ever made before. It begins with Wright's keyboard-orientated, avant garde classical instrumental, \\"Sysyphus\\". It's indulgent and over-serious but brilliant and it proves what an excellent composer Rick is.<BR>After the classical grandeur of \\"Sysyphus\\", Roger gives us the wonderfully mellow ballad, \\"Grantchester Meadows\\". It really does bring \\"sounds of yesterday into this city room\\". The birdsong, trickling water, acoustic guitar, smooth singing and soothing lyrics create a dreamy seven minutes of relaxation, which ends withthe sound of an unfortunate fly being swatted (typical of Water's humour). Roger's other composition is the mad piece of entertainment: \\"Several species of small fury animals gathered together in a cave and grooving with a pict\\". (the pict is almost incomprehensible but I'm sure he says something about \\"the wind cried mary\\" and \\"Bob is dead!\\"<BR> Dave created something wonderful with \\"the narrow way\\", a three part epic that begins with a tuneful acoustic guitar section that has heavenly backing vocals and weird effects in the background that jump beautifully between the guitar notes and gradually get louder and then sink into a dark and unnerving riff that sounds like Tony Iommi playing \\"set the controls...\\" on a worn out telecaster with only three strings. Part three is really classic though. The singing is really good and the fact that Gilmour uses keybourds, bass and drums as well as guitar make it sound more like a group effort than the other studio cuts.<BR>\\"The Narrow way\\" would have made a climatic ending but as an encore comes Nick Mason's effort. \\"The Grand Visier's Garden party\\" is a complex sound collage, which builds layers of percussion and stretches recording technology to the brink. It makes an interesting listen and the drum solo at the end of part two is superb. Nick closes the piece and the album with unassuming flutes. <BR>Ummagumma is a monument of couragious sound experiments that has every right to the respect it never gets. Incidentally, \\"ummagumma\\" is an English euphemism for shagging.
630280082X|5.0|I'm giving it 5 stars based on the excellent guitar duel at the end. Steve Vai is a great player, and if you are a fan of his this is a must see. I disagree with the person who said Steve Vai is just a &quot;technique player&quot; and lacks creativity. Vai is very creative, and he puts more emotion and heart into his playing than anyone. By the way technique is a good thing, you can't penalize someone for knowing how to play well! Vai can play many styles from classical to rock to blues. In my opinion Hendrix couldn't touch Vai.
B00002E233|5.0|This movie was very good.<BR>From start to finish the movie delivered action and trillers.<BR>I had a great time watching this movie in the theater and on DVD.<BR>The film did not go the same route that many other horror/trillers have gone in the past.<BR>There are a few surprises and its just one of those films you watch to be entertained.<BR>I liked it and if you have not seen it yet, I would recommend that you do.<BR>There are a few shots in the movie, the sharks does look fake, but there are many other scenes of the sharks that look great.<BR>(Those few shots are not a big deal)<BR>Give this movie a try, especially for those that love a violent survival to the finish movie.
B000056K04|4.0|I enjoy all the DMB albums and this one is no different.  I liked hearing the guys take a different approach and think they hit on some very good material.  It's not my favorite DMB album and some of the songs aren't very interesting... but other songs are fantastic and I hold this album as just as 'important' as any other, in its own unique way.  It's a strong whole with some real nice songs and a brand new sound.
B000002J03|5.0|led Zeppelin II proves there are just as many possibilities for artistic sophistication within the realm of &quot;simple&quot; blues songs as there are in more obtuse and expansive songwriting efforts by performers like the Beatles or Bob Dylan. Despite the various titles that have been on thrown on various hard rock bands, Led Zep truly IS the thinking persons Metal. Jimmy Page's natural feel for built-to-last guitar riffs is mirrored in his equally essential ear as a producer. Every arrangement is one finely crafed slab of solid rock that asserts it's unequivocal masculanity on all levels: swaggerring rhythms, over-driven amps, and lyrics of a crude passion devoid of pretense. This is the essence of rock&amp;roll.

B00003CXQX|1.0|<br />I wanted to see Castaway.  I really did.  But I had to take my little brother, and my dad was the one paying for the tickets, so I HAD to see it.  Plus, it had good reviews from the critics, so I figured it couldn't be all bad, right?  WRONG.<BR><br />\\"The Emperor's New Groove\\" is unfunny, simplistic, and stupid.  Despite the talent that went into it, it was awful.  The best character was the squirrel, I swear.  The jokes weren't funny, and I found myself constantly praying that the witch, would catch Kuzco and kill him.  The film was so Un-Disney I almost cried.  The reasons why:<BR><br />1. Lack of music.  There was no music!  Disney was one of the last film companies to make musicals, and now it is no more.  I guess the musicals are a lost genre, which [...stinks], because Disney really did have great music.<BR><br />2. Lack of terrifying bad guy.  Look at all the past Disney classics.  You have Ursula, Millicent, Cruella DeVille, Scar, and others.  What do they all have in common?  They're all terrifying.  However, in an attempt to make the witch (I don't even bother to remember her name) funny, they just made her unscary and totally retarded.<BR><br />3. Bad animation: I totally loathed the animation.  Where was the detail, the beauty, the grace that all other Disney movies had?  Nowhere!  This movie was badly drawn, above all things.<BR><br />I don't know what Disney was thinking.  But whatever it was, it wasn't about making a good movie.<BR><br />And you know what the worst part is?  My little brother got to see Castaway anyway.
B00005LOUS|2.0|<br />&quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; is a classic story by the master storyteller Dr. Seuss.  It has an anti-commercialist message, but isn't overly preachy.  This, however, is disgusting.  It's hypocritical in the way that it was over-commercialized, and the plot totally strays from the book.  In an attempt to lengthen the book's plot into a two-hour movie, it was mutilated and convoluted.  Not only did the costume manager manage to make Jim Carrey thouroughly disgusting, she or he did so with the Whos too.  The only good part was the sets, which were pure eye candy, from the bright colors of Whoville to the dank musty caves of the Grinch.<BR><br />All in all, get the original animated version.  Don't waste your precious cash on this travesty.
B000056K04|3.0|On the grand scale of music this cd ends up making the cut. It's not bad, if you spend some time with it it'll grow on you, definately. BUT, compared to any other DMB cd if falls drastically short. No song breaks the five minute mark. There's not jamming there's no REAL impressive musical talent. Lyrically Dave busts them out again with incredible lyrics, but the music just falls short compartively. Over all a good CD, but not compared to any other dave stuff, especially including the lilywhite sessions.
B00003CX9E|3.0|You can pretty much tell a good deal about people by what film they consider to be the greatest film of all time. Some say &quot;Godfather&quot;, others &quot;The Matrix&quot; (usually adolescent males), &quot;von Stroheim's &quot;Greed&quot; (my own choice), &quot;The Bicycle Thief&quot;, etc. Those who like &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; tend to be very, very liberal and a bit anti-american (either by being snobs or by being anti-capitalist) as they relish its story of how money and power corrupts, as if money and power can only corrupt Americans (Hello? Has anyone heard of the Medici's?). These fans of the film gleefully point to the film as some kind of indictment of the american dream. It is nothing of the sort. It is the indictment of one man, a fictional character who never existed. Any attempt to condemn the real life Hearst because of the film &quot;Kane&quot; is grossly unfair. For one thing, Heart's mistress, Marion Davies, was a talented comedienne (See the video &quot;Show People&quot;) not the no-talent dummy portrayed in the film. Rather than being a major anti-capitalist statement, the film is simply a very lukewarm melodrama. It is also absurd and just plain silly, also. I won't tell you what &quot;Rosebud&quot; is (so as not to ruin the film for you if you haven't seen it) but it has to be the stupidest plot device and conclusion in film history. Anyone who doesn't finish watching the ending with either hysterics, or a deep sense of resentment that such a build up should have such a major let down needs to have their head examined. As far as the film techniques in this film go, many of them are not only unnecessary, but downright excessive. I would not even put &quot;Kane&quot; in my list of top 100 films. I find it nothing but a moderately engaging curiousity.
6302409365|3.0|I saw this movie once and I thought it was ok but I was also a little bored and it's not one of those movies that I could watch over and over again, I just don't have the urge to watch it again and though the old classic TV show is not my favorite old classic TV show I think it's far superior to the movie!
B00005LW3J|4.0|The collection is of the titles: 1) Weather Women, 2) Ladies Phone Club, 3) Terminatrix, 4) Tokyo Decamaron 5) Undressed for Success and 6) Sumo Vixens.<br />Each DVD is in it's own case, and all are stored in a cardboard box. To determine if this set is right for you, you should look at the reviews for each title before dropping this kind of cash. But, if you like what you see, it is a good bargain as seperately these titles would run in the neighborhood of $125.00.
B00003CXP1|1.0|You think life could not be any worse.  Take all the bad things in this world drugs, prostitution, abuse, hate, anger, addiction, and pure fear and roll them into an &quot;in your face reality...then call it Requiem for a Dream.&quot;<br />I had to put another movie on after this movie ended finally. I did not want to go to bed with this film on my mind.  I truly fear what my sunconscious has done with it.  It will leave you in a bad mental place.  I do give him credit for his direction and editing as the ONLY good things about this film.  It case you did not get it. I don't like this movie nor would I ever recommend this film to anyone unless they are meant to be tortured.
B00000JCOV|5.0|.... I think that this band is great and they are MODERN DEAHT METAL AT ITS FINEST. the only band that is heavier by a long shot is slayer and they are great to. So if you are getting into the heavy metal world i would suggest this cd. also check out, MuDvAyNe Slayer Black sabbath OZZY deftones etc. REMEMBER just because a band is new and maybe a little different doesnt mean they are a poser death metal band.
0891411194|5.0|I felt the author did an outstanding job telling his story of war.  Mr. Sledge shows that being an infantryman in a war zone is one of the most difficult things that one could be asked to do.  His descriptions of the battlefield and horror of war overshadow everything I had ever seen or heard.  Also, I see the comradship that he formed with the other men he served with.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading his book and would recommend it to anyone.
B0000009N1|5.0|First, I've read many of the other listener's reviews here and wish to say that Zappa fans are a bit more discriminating than your average &quot;Rock&quot; listener and a sight more literate too! Now, about Hot Rats: The first time I heard this glorious record (on vinyl, natch) I was immediately taken! As it happens, a fire engine was riding by outside with the siren going while Willie The Pimp was playing and it blended perfectly! I was already a young, budding Zappahead at that time - the mid 70s. A friend's brother-in-law had Hot Rats. He was the kind of guy who wasn't really a Zappa fan, but EVERYBODY who loves REAL music MUST own Hot Rats! He did, and I was lucky enough to listen to it that first time. Other reviewers here have lamented about the discrepancies in the CD version compared with the original vinyl mix. I, too, am very disapointed with our dear Uncle Frank for messing it up. Sorry Frank, rest in peace. The music on Hot Rats should really be listened to in it's original mix. I don't know if it will ever happen. After much complaining about We're Only In It For The Money and it's replaced drum and bass tracks, another version pretty much identical to the original vinyl mix was released. Who knows? I remain eternally hopeful. I read somewhere that during the guitar solo in Gumbo Variations, the musician's union official was tapping Zappa on the shoulder with his trusty #2 pencil, trying to get his attention. If that's true, Zappa probably used the tapping as a metronome to play those hot licks by. Anyway, BUY this CD and look for the vinyl in used record stores. Even through the scratches you will find GOLD in them grooves!
B00005U2LM|3.0|Well, I kind of have the same problem with this Wu Tang album as I had with their last (The W). I don't enjoy every beat, as the matter of fact I don't like most of the beats! When I red some of the reviews 'bout this CD [...] I expected this to be a huge succes and the \\"come-back\\" of the Wu-Tang Clan but when I purchased it I was a little disappointed. I expected a little more, I guess I'm not on the same level as the Wu or something like that because I really don't like the beats on this album! There are a few I like wich are \\"Rules\\", wich is my personal favourite, \\"Soul Power\\", \\"UZI\\" and \\"Dashing\\" (note: the last song I mentioned I can't play anymore 'cause my little sis made a huge scratch in the disc and now it's damaged) anyhow, those are the best songs on the album! Well, the lyrics and the flow are prety much the same as on their previous album, actually the whole atmosphere is kind of the same! If you liked \\"the W\\" you'll probably like this too, if you didn't you won't, it's that simple...
B0000029DD|5.0|Simply put, this is the best CD i have in my intire collection.<BR>Jeff was an incredible songwriter, and an awsome singer. This is probably the best first album everyone ever made. Wonderfull songs like GRACE or LOVER YOU SHOULD'VE COME OVER, combined with a breath taking version of Leonard Cohens Hallelujah make this a must have CD for any music lover.
B000001FGG|5.0|When Eric, Jack, and Ginger entered the studio to record &quot;Wheels of Fire,&quot; they knew what they wanted to do.  They wanted to record an album that showed what Cream had grown to be over the past two years.  Mission accomplished.  Leading off with the classic &quot;White Room,&quot; this song was a fine example of what this band could do.  Starting off with decending chords backed by Ginger's tribal drumming, this is a psychedelic masterwork.  Clapton's wah-wah solos and Bruce's vocals drive this song.  Also pay special attention to Gingers drumming.  He is all over the kit creating an amazing rythmic structure.  Next comes &quot;Sitting On Top of the World.&quot;  Clapton's guitars are amazing here.  In the back you have sludgy power chords with a heavily distorted lead churning out blues lick after blues lick.  1960's heavy blues doesn't come any better than this.  Ginger's song &quot;Passing the Time&quot; comes next.  For one of Ginger's songs, this is quite good.  The middle jam is awesome especially with Jack ripping line after line on his SG bass.  Jack's &quot;As You Said&quot; is a little flat, and is more appropriate for his 1969 solo album Songs for a Tailor.  Ginger's &quot;Pressed Rat and Warthog&quot; is horrible, but listening to Jack's basswork is great.  &quot;Politician&quot; is a lost gem.  This is pure Cream.  A heavy riff, great syncopated drumming, and awesome lyrics.  The middle solo is beyond words.  A triple overdub on guitar, Jack's monsterous bass, and ginger's drums driving the riff on.  I can imagine how fitting this song was for the 1968 presidential election.  &quot;Those Were the Days&quot; is decent but far from great.  &quot;Born under a Bad Sign&quot; is just awesome.  Great lyrics, great playing, great song.  &quot;Deserted Cities of the Heart&quot; is a hidden classic.  With gloom and doom lyrics set a moderate pace, this is a unique Cream song.  Clapton comes to life in the middle solo with a heavily distorted solo.  Payspecial attention to Ginger's double bass drums hammering it home.  The studio album is great for '68, but the live album is before it's time.  The whole live album is immaculate.  You can almost hear the audience stading up to applaude Ginger's Toad.  Do yourself a favor, buy this album.  Listen to it as a whole, then focus on each musician's playing.  You will have an amazing respect for these guys and what they succeeded is creating-a landmark rock album.
B00003CXXJ|3.0|Maybe the tremendous press about this film ... word-of-mouth, reviews, hype, etc. .... raised my expectations too high, but personally I don't understand the fuss over this film.  Animation is mostly nice, yeah, but the human characters are not as lifelike as what some enthusiasts would have you believe.  Personally, I think the creators went a little overboard trying to make the humans _too_ human -- a little stylization would have helped with the suspension of disbelief.  There are some nice bits sending up Disney, like the exploding bluebird and like Cinderella fighting with Snow White over the bridal bouquet.  But the nice bits are sporadic, and this movie steals more from Disney than it ever pokes fun.  The transformation scene, for instance, is nearly identical to the transformation in Disney's Beauty and the Beast.  Sure, Eddie Murphy's a joy, but this is the same performance he turned in for Mulan.  Sure, the merry men are cute, but their musical number is less inspired than Men In Tights, from which they stole the idea.  And am I the only one who wonders why the swamp-dwelling Shrek has a Scots accent, or why Robin Hood is French?  Shrek is an enjoyable hour and a half but best of its kind, it ain't.  Any Pixar movie has this one beat, hands-down.

B000002N3N|5.0|i never heard or had knowledge about enya until i heard &quot;anywhere is&quot;. this is such a great album and it makes me wonder why a lot of people don't like it that much. they say that this is below watermark however, i disagree. watermark is a great album but this is better. the only enya song that i never liked that much is Orinoco flow. now going back to the album... i loved they way enya presents the wisdom and power of nature. the cover is sublime! her voice is very beautiful and my goodness the songs are very good, okay they are the best! every song is a perfect &quot;memory of trees&quot;.
B00003CXXP|5.0|When I first saw the A.I. trailer on television, I didn't think it would be my type of movie. Science Fiction?? Robots?? I've never liked either. However, I do like Steven Spielberg and Haley Joel Osment, so when my friend asked me if I'd like to go to see a movie, I recommended we see this one. <br />It is about a robot boy named David who is programmed to love. David is taken in by Henry and Monica Swinton, whose real son is in a coma and not expected to live. Miraculously, their son awakens from the coma and rejoins the family. After the occurrence of a few events that really are harmless but seem to the parents as if David was dangerous, David is abandoned to fend for himself. The robot is desperate for the love of his &quot;mother,&quot; and thinking that Monica would love him if he was a real boy, he sets out on a mission to find the Blue Fairy (from the Pinocchio story). He joins up with Gigolo Joe, a -ahem- different type of lover robot and sets out on his journey that will expose him to the darker side of future human society. <br />I loved it this movie. It was not only entertaining, but also made you think. Watching the movie made me ask myself some questions that I had never thought of before. <br />What makes us human? Is a world like this possible? This movie presents both in a thoughtful way. <br />I cried during the more sensitive scenes in the movie and was embarrassed because the friend I saw the movie with was very emotionally stalwart. When I looked over at her, I was surprised to see her crying too. This movie presents raw emotion in a noncomplex way that really gets at you. The acting is fabulous and heartrending and particular scenes will stay with you for a very long time. <br />In the end, I found it ironic that Monica could be re-created out of one strand of hair--in the beginning of the movie, she said something like: &quot;In the inside, he's just like all the others. But on the outside...&quot; and Henry responded with: &quot;Yes...100 yards of material, like all the others.&quot; when all it took to make Monica was one microscopic strand of DNA. Speaking of that, is the re-created Monica real? Aren't humans more than just DNA--are our personalities made of something more? As I watched, it occurred to me that maybe her appearance could be re-created, but she could have acted the way she did because David wanted her to.  <BR>--Just something to chew on for all you people who've already seen it... <br />This movie touched me in a way that only a few other movies and books ever have. It made me think, it made me cry, and, most importantly, it made me FEEL.<br />I recommend this movie wholeheartedly.
B00005U122|5.0|No, this DVD is not like being there.  I say this because it's physically impossible to sit in the dead center of an arena to get perfect sound and walk around on stage getting the fantastic filming shots this achieves at the same time.<br />What a spectacular DVD: in short, this is the best concert DVD I own.  I was slightly disappointed with the somewhat muddy sound quality of the &quot;In the Flesh&quot; audio CD release, but this one blows all of that away.  The Dolby digital is great, reproducing as well as can be expected the complexities that went into the sound production of each live show.  For instance, during the keyboard/synth solo of the glorious 17-minute performance of &quot;Dogs,&quot; the dog barking effects are coming from all different directions.  It's as if you're in section 5, dead-center of the floor, with the house sound system coming at you in all directions.  Jon Carin's masterful work on keyboards and synth swirl it all into a psychadelic masterpiece.  Meanwhile, at stage-center, Roger and his three guitarists (Andy Fairweather-Low, Doyle Bramhall II, and Snowy White) play a game of cards, all of which you can witness from an up-close perspective - so much so that you can hear them ribbing each other.<br />That incredible sound quality I mentioned hits you right from the opening number, &quot;In the Flesh,&quot; impeccably reproduced here to mimic the effect those opening chords had on you as you sat in anticipation to Graham Broad's drum cadence, Roger looming in the darkness on the catwalk behind him.  It'll have you in awe throughout the performance, from the beautiful voice of Katie Kissoon during &quot;Mother&quot; to the overwhelming arena sing-along of &quot;Perfect Sense Part Two.&quot;  If that one doesn't give you shivers down the spine, nothing will.  Roger pleads with the audience as he marches across the stage, arms out wide, &quot;Can't you see, it all makes perfect sense, expressed in dollars and cents, pounds, shillings, and pence?&quot;<br />To answer any questions you might have about the filming, I couldn't imagine a better job.  There aren't too many shots from the crowd's vantage point, there aren't so many close-ups that you forget it's a live performance, there aren't just two or three camera angles as there seem to be in Neil Young's &quot;Red Rocks&quot; disc, there isn't any of the quick-cut editing you'll see in Cream's Farewell Concert.  This is a beautiful production that matches up with the music very, very, very well.  Cameras sway in between them at the right times, give you enough of an audience perspective to take it all in, and blend mixed shots and fades flawlessly.  It's perfect!<br />Now for less technical thoughts: *any* Pink Floyd fan from the curious newbie to the fanatical completist will enjoy this disc.  Roger's vocals aren't what they were in 1977, but they're much stronger here than they sounded in 1992's &quot;Amused to Death&quot; album.  What you get is an intensely moving sequence of his works from 1968 (Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun, complete with an all-out psychadelic guitar attack courtesy of Mr. Snowy White), through the highlights of Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, and of course, The Wall.  Roger's solo material isn't covered in a lot of depth (there is one track from 1984's Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, none from 1987's Radio KAOS), but what's there is superb.  The tracks from Amused to Death have never sounded so fresh, so vital, and oh so good.  The title track of that album comes alive here, evidenced by the grin shared between White and Bramhall as they begin the wave of guitars that close out the latter half of the song.  Roger's new tune, &quot;Each Small Candle,&quot; provides much hope for his next album, which will probably come out in less than 20 years.<br />Those who worry they'll miss David Gilmour will grow to appreciate both the new touch Doyle puts on Gilmour's guitar licks (he hits all the right notes and then some, and his interpretation of the solo in Time makes me want to listen to nothing but this version) as well as his bluesy, silk-voiced vocals.  And what's to be said of Snowy White, who does a marvelous job throughout the disc of covering many of the tracks he played with the Floyd in 1977 and 1980, including &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond,&quot; &quot;Another Brick in the Wall Part 2,&quot; and a virtuoso duel on the aforementioned &quot;Dogs&quot; and the show's closer, &quot;Comfortably Numb,&quot; which ends with the young gun and the seasoned veteran transcending generations to battle each other and share a few smiles of respect on the catwalk as everyone else looks on.  Andy Fairweather-Low is a genius out of the limelight, substituting in on bass for Roger at certain times and nailing the rhythm guitar job.  His lead highlight comes during the three-pronged guitar attack in &quot;Money.&quot;  A look at the faces of Jon Carin, who sits back, folds his hands together and watches with a big smile; and the rest of the bandmembers says enough.<br />I'm rambling too much - now for a quick word on the extras.  The lyrics are a nice touch for new fans but for those of us who've known all the words for years, they can be turned off.  The still images are all quite nice for the occasional glance, but won't be something I return to as much as I do the rehearsal footage.  Now, this isn't the half hour it promises (more like 18 minutes), but what you get is an insightful view from within the band.  You share the stage with them as they get their act together in a high school auditorium in New York.  You're in the dressing room with them before the show, as Andy defiantly proclaims that he won't go on without socks, Roger sarcastically compliments him on his suit while strumming an old 40s-ish tune, Graham Broad amazes us with his juggling and scooter talents, and Doyle does his best Elvis imitation while wife and backup vocalist Susannah Melvoin tells him he'sgot &quot;a wig thing going on.&quot;  Priceless.<br />BUY IT!!!!!!
B00005OM4N|4.0|At first I didn't think I would like this cd. My friends bought it and were trying to convince me to get it and the songs were really cool. My friend left it at my house on accident when she was over so I put it in, curious as to what was on it. Surprisingly it's really good except for a couple songs. I've found myself listening to it. Just try it.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I first stumbled across Incubus the summer of '99 and fell in love with their music (wasn't it a nice surprise for Brandon to be easy on the eyes:), but that has nothing to do with the album.) I anticipated this CD so much, and was so pleased with it.  It was in my stereo for about a month straight! <BR>Okay, so everyone else is reviewing every track so I will too...<BR>1. Nice To Know You...Amazing song! The pre-chorus is not expected and remarkable.  Awesome song!<BR>2. Circles...This song rocks, period. Really great lyrics.  A great tune. &quot;I saw you standing in my headlights.  Blink, blink, blink&quot; Love that!<BR>3. Wish You Were Here...Just makes me happy.  A great song that is doing awesome! <BR>4. Just A Phase...Some people don't like this one very much, but I love IT! You don't know what to expect from it.  Instead of keeping the chorus at the same levels it bulids up and explodes.  Absolutely fantastic!<BR>5. 11am...Again, not well recieved by some but it has a great laid-back feel and painfully beautiful lyrics.  &quot;I never thought I could want someone so much / Because now your not here / And I'm knee deep in that old fear.&quot; Beautiful.<BR>6. Blood On the Ground...This is probably my least favorite song on the album.  Seems old and a little too angry at the begining.  But totally redeems itself at the end.  I love this one too.<BR>7. Mexico...I expected to like it more than I do.  I guess I feel that the lyrics don't fit the actual instrumentation as well as I'd like.  Don't get me wrong, it's still a great song!<BR>8. Warning...Oooh, oooh, ooh! My ABSOLUTE fav on this album! When they performed it live I thought I was going to die! It is just an amazing song! Lyrics, melody, EVERYTHING! &quot;I suggest we learn to love ourselves before it's made illegal.&quot; Heed their advice!<BR>9. Echo...A sweet, sweet love song.  Dosen't really stand out in my mind but is a great track nevertheless.  <BR>10. Have You Ever...Again, this one is often listed as not a &quot;favorite&quot;, but I beg to differ.  This song shows you how Incubus can take the lyrics of a love song, throw them against a rock track and make it work.  &quot;My problem is you make me melt, and I don't want to be frozen anymore.&quot; The best line on the album and it is in a song that kicks some serious you know what! Great song!<BR>11. Are You In...Simple lyrics with awesome turntables! It is a great song and just kinda makes you feel good.<BR>12. Under My Umbrella...This song rocks! Not one of my top songs but still a great tune to listen to! <BR>13. Aqueous Transmission...Here's the diversity again! It's fantastic that the sitar is back in business in rock 'n' roll! I love this song with it's flowing melody and beautiful lyrics.<br />I guess that's my take on the album.  I feel like this album can connect with anyone that listens to it.  They do some amazing things and do them so well.  They jump in and out of genres and do it with ease.  An unbelievable album from an amazing band!
B00005V1Y0|5.0|One of the most egregious and unforgiveable DVD absences is set right at long last. There are no tech details listed yet, so I can only hope the studio intends to handle this release like the jewel it should be -- including background on the original stage production and giving the film itself the full-tilt digital treatment.<br />If you're a 'Moulin Rouge' fan who's not yet experienced the gleefully malfeasant, candy-colored universe of the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix Amateur Championships, you're in for a fabulous treat. If, like me, you've been anticipating this DVD release above many others, go us!! No, it's not cinematic rocket science or brain surgery or even really a gourmet meal, but from the opening 'documentary' to the final steps, unless your curmudgeon status is chronic and immutable, it's simply not possible to maintain a bad mood while viewing. For a movie like this, that's all you really need to know.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|I bought this for a friend last year... and she loves the Beatles... I on the other hand... yuck! But, good CD.
0671027344|5.0|Would you like to know how some teenagers deal with high school? If the answer is yes then this is the book to read. It gives you a good idea of what goes on in a typical high school. I am a high school senior and I was able to relate to some of the issues the characters dealt with. There were also parts of the book that were unusual and would not necessarily relate to all the students in high school. The main character was a high school freshman named Charlie. He befriends two seniors named Patrick and Samantha and all his high school adventures begin! They take him to parties where he deals with issues of drugs and sexuality.  Charlie is learning how to deal with friendships and relationships.  The book was written in a unique way.  Charlie was writing to an unknown recipient who he refers to as \\"friend\\".  This was very clever and it helped to reader to understand how the character truly felt and exactly what he was thinking.  I felt like I knew the main character by the end of the book because you learn so much about his emotions.  He is very intelligent and sometimes faced depression when he thought about his aunt and his best friend, whom had passed away.  His family also plays an important role in how he deals with the issues in his life.  Charlie has two older siblings and his sister is rather distant.  When his sister fears she is pregnant Charlie helps her to deal with her fears.  This brings them very close together and in the end helps him through a depression he faces when he realizes the kind of relationship he had with his aunt.  I would recommend this book to teens in high school because it makes you feel like your not the only one facing the hardships of growing up!
B0000033OT|5.0|Donny Hathaway is one of the most vital figures in 1970's soul music.  This album is nothing short of excellent, with the heart-moving &quot;I Love You.&quot;  In this day in age where male r&amp;b singers get more and more trendy, we need a vocalist like Hathaway more urgently than ever.
B000001E2W|5.0|I think this is one of the best CD's I own, it's a great live album and most of Anthrax's classics are included.The sound quality is pretty good, some people think it's not so good,but I think it's fine.The first 8 tracks were recorded live in Irvine Meadows, California in 1991, the last 4 tracks we're recorded live at Electric Lady studio in 1992.If you like Anthrax then you owe it to yourself to pick this CD up!
0062502182|3.0|A book worth reading, very simply written and has an extremely moral message. But I think the book could have had more depth. Quite religious - if you like this kind of 'spiritual' stuff, a high recommendation. Some parts are really quite lovely.  And I like the ending. Overall, worth a read!
630575067X|1.0|To those of you who can actually enjoy pathetic acting, an idiotic storyline, bad directing, and bad editing (that's just the tip of the iceberg, however) this film is most definitely for you. Directly from the start, with the &quot;bad guys&quot; who look like some form of mutant insect and talk as if they've just stepped off the set of &quot;Barney Meets the Power Rangers,&quot; this film took a steep nosedive. Two of the only redeeming aspects of this entire film are 1) the musical score playing in the background, and 2) good special effects; and even both of those, when used improperly, can be infuriating. Take the latter example, for instance. The special effects are good, certainly, but Lucas uses them to the point of insanity. They are, simply put, too much. Another major mistake Lucas made was casting Jake Lloyd as Darth Vader's previous self. Jake Lloyd stumbles through his lines as does the rest of the cast, creating an ugly and embarrasing atmosphere. Lucas deserves a swift kick in the seat of his pants for this atrocity.
B00005LC1H|5.0|What can I say - simply the best EVER comedy series made! Incredible writing and execution makes Fawlty Towers unparalelled in its comic brilliance. Thank god they never made a third series for fear of spoiling what was already perfect. Although an episode revolving around the Major would have been fun. A great box set although an interview with Connie Booth wouldn't have gone astray. An absolute must have box set for any fan of genuinely brilliant comedy.
B00005TT77|3.0|When i get a tribute album (while yes they call this a &quot;soundtrack&quot; it is in a maner of speaking a tribute album) I like to see the artists iterpret the songs their own way.  I am a Beatle maniac, even though i was born about 30 years after Sir Paul and John (RIP) met in a churh.  I can see their influence even in todays uninspierd music, and much of this falls into that category.  While yes all the songs are just fine, non are bad or even sub par, but very few stand out as anything special.  Paul Westerberg puts an acoustic country flavor on Nowhere Man.  Ben Harper makes Strawberry Feilds a beautiful, soulful R&amp;B tune.  Chocolate Genius does a very interesting version of Julia which doesn't quiet deliver.  The one person on the whole cd i had never heard let alone heard of delivers the goods, Howie Day does a phenominal version of help (John still does it better), there is also the rather cooky version of Revolution by the indie kings Grandaddy.<br />I don't hate this album but i do wish that people like eddie vedder and the black crowes didn't do &quot;loving tributes&quot; but did somthing with a little more balls...for lack of a better expression<BR>Worth the listen for all beatle-maniacs maybe not worth the money, it all depends on you.
B000024D4R|5.0|Growing up with Floyd, I've played The Wall and Dark Side hundreds of times, and I don't care if I ever hear them again.  There's better Floyd, anyway, and this is the best of them all.
0767849493|5.0|The fourth movie by writer/actor/director Kevin Smith, 1999's &quot;Dogma&quot;, is a hilarious look into the ideology behind organized religion, specifically Catholicism. With a great cast and laugh-out-loud humor, you can not go wrong with this movie.<br />The storyline of the movie is pretty interesting: Two angels (Ben Affleck and Matt Damon) are trying to re-enter Heaven through the usage of a loop hole in Catholic Dogma. Their re-entrance would mean the end of existance. The movie brings in and questions many of the beliefs behind religion, such as the gender of God (played by Alanis Morissette), the ethnicity of Jesus (as told by Chris Rock's character, Rufus, the 13th apostle), descendants of Christ (Linda Fiorentino), and the infallibility of God (as told by the Voice Of God, played by Alan Rickman).<br />The best part of this movie, as well as the other Kevin Smith movies, is the involvement of Jay And Silent Bob (played by Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith, respectively). Jay's vulgar mouth and passion for getting high combined with the mystery of Silent Bob just makes the movie all the more funnier and entertaining. <br />This movie is a comedy delight for those who love this kind of humor (pot jokes, swearing, and all around stupidity). If you like this movie, you should also check out the Kevin Smith movie &quot;Mallrats&quot;.
0345440757|5.0|This method works, but it is not without work.  Any book that proclaims that their method is &quot;easy&quot;, is mistaken.  **However** life for the child is more predictable, diagnosing the meaning of a baby's cry is easier, and things just make more sense.  This book provides guidelines and tricks of the trade.  If you read the Sears and the Ferber books, as well as that &quot;Babywise&quot; book, you'll see that there are some commonalities as well as differences between Hogg's book and all of them.  It's good if you want a middle ground to bring up your child in a healthy, loving, respectful environment.  My opinion is that this book is the best of the others.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Iron Maiden's 2000 release, Brave New World, is a return to style and form. After a 6 year absence of Bruce Dickinson and a near decade without Adrian Smith, they return to Iron Maiden to revive the successful career they had in the 80s.<br />Iron Maiden has had a definitive sound and style since &quot;Number Of The Beast&quot; and this album continue that trend. With the return of guitarist Adrian Smith (played from &quot;Killers&quot; to &quot;Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son&quot;) as well as the continued membership of the two guitarists that were still in Maiden, Dave Murray and Janick Gers, the band has become a three-guitar assault of power chords and awesome solos . With the return of the &quot;Air Raid Siren&quot; Bruce Dickinson (played from &quot;Number Of The Beast&quot; to &quot;Fear Of The Dark&quot;), the band is at the top of their game and sound like they did nearly 20 years ago. Bassist Steve Harris continues his prowess of powerful bass lines and lyrical contributions while drummer Nicko McBrain shows that he is the man and does not let up on this 67+ masterpiece.<br />The first track, &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; comes in with a bang and is reminiscent of a regular Iron Maiden rocker. The next three songs, &quot;The Ghost Of The Navigator&quot;, the title track and &quot;Blood Brother&quot;, are incredible songs that are very much unlike anything Iron Maiden did when Dickinson and Adrian were still in the band. The songs sound like they could have come from Virtual XI or X Factor with Dickinson on vocals. The rest of the tracks are very good and leave me thinking about how great a band Iron Maiden is and how musically amazing they are as a group. The one track that stands out the most is &quot;Dream Of Mirrors&quot; which starts off soft and eerie and evolves into a powerhouse of music with a near insanity in the lyrics.<br />This is a must have for any and every Iron Maiden fan around the world. This revives the excellence the band showed at their peak with a few new suprises. Fans of bands like Metallica should be pleased as well. This album amazed me when I bought it. Let it do the same for you.
0062502182|3.0|I'm not sure if its the writing style or the translation, but this book makes you feel like you're in Nursery School.  But then again, I felt the same way about Siddartha by Herman Hesse.  Very basic concepts that illiterate people find profound.
B00004RYZT|5.0|This DVD is awesome! the overall quality of the songs is great! it makes a fabulous addition to anybody's DVD collection. And Rammstein ROCKS!
B0000560X3|5.0|I have a number of DVD Audio Disks and DTS 5.1 CD's (as they are called). I currently do not have a DVD Audio player but I have heard one on a good system. The Dolby Versions on this disk and Brain Salad Surgery sound absolutely fantastic (especially Brain Salad Surgery). You will not believe the difference from the original. If you don't have DVD Audio yet buy these disks anyway for the Dolby Surround track. You won't be disappointed. By the way, DVD Audio is in another state of flux in that a  Digital connection is now being developed as the standard to replace the 6 analog inputs currently used. When this happens the theoretical maximum sampling rate of 192 kbit standard will be able to be used and bass management will be incorporated. DVD Audio is nowhere near it's naximum capability at this point with the analog connections. Unfortunately this means that you will no doubt have to replace your DVD Audio player as well as your receiver to benefit from these changes. The short of it is, you should think about why you should buy a DVD Audio Player now when in 6 months it will be outdated and incapable of producing the higher resolution sound. It will be bad enough to have to replace your receiver.

B000002LMM|5.0|One of the sometimes-forgotten keys to the success of David Lynch's films is his use of composer Angelo Badalamenti.  Badalamenti's moody compositions -- with their almost introspective, otherworldly sounds -- often times seem to be the key to lulling visitors into the world of Lynch's imagination.  Often, Badalamenti's music so perfectly matches Lynch's images that it becomes impossible to seperate the two.  Certainly, this is true of the score Badalamenti composed for Lynch's groundbreaking TV series, Twin Peaks.  Even though Twin Peaks was cancelled over ten years ago, the minute I hear Badalementi's haunting theme music, I can automatically the deceptively placid opening images of the series' opening credits as clearly and perfectly as if I had just seen the show last night.  Twin Peaks, as with most of Lynch's work, dealt with the chaos that usually raged beneath the safest exteriors and Badalamenti's score -- serene yet strangely ominous and always suggesting soemthing lurking right around the corner -- perfectly captured that theme.  With soundtracks growing more and more bland (especially television scores, which are usually designed to be as unmemorable as possible lest a viewer be turned off), Badalamenti's work on this soundtrack serves as wonderful evidence of what a truly talented and individual composer can do even within the confines of the soundtrack genre.<br />Also, note should be made of singer Julee Cruise's contributions to the soundtrack.  Much like Badalamenti, Cruise's music has an otherworldly, slightly melancholy feel to it but whereas Badalamenti takes you back to the series' sense of menace, Cruise's songs serve to remind you of the romantically hopeful idealism that occasionally surfaced as well.  If Badalamenti created a world where Laura Palmer could be murdered by her own father, Cruise's songs remind you that it was also a world where Leland Palmer could find forgiveness for his crime.<br />All in all, an amazing soundtrack for fansand nonfans of the show alike.  When listening to both Badalamenti and Cruise, even the most common of sights takes on new depth and meaning.  To me, the sign of a great recording is whether or not it changes the world around you while you listen to it.  This soundtrack certainly does so.
B00004X01U|5.0|Whats to say about Madonna ? She is always outdoing herself. And her &quot;Music&quot; CD is her best to date. I loved the dance beats on &quot;Music&quot; and &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; that brought back memories of her disco days. Then there is the ballad &quot;I Deserve It&quot; which talks about &quot;this guy&quot; - you wonder if it is her husband that she is talking about. The upbeat pop of &quot;Amazing&quot; is fantastic. And &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl&quot; is a great song even though Madonna talks with an english accent - but she is Madonna and she can do anything she wants. A &quot;must&quot; for any Madonna fan.
B00005JKQX|4.0|The movie cinematography, casting and story line were wonderful. Quite interesting. I walked away feeling sympathy for all with mental illness.
B00002MZ12|3.0|Alanis is outstanding on this CD. Hearing these songs<br />&quot;unplugged&quot; is an interesting way to listen to them. I really loved the cover she does of &quot;King of Pain&quot;. But I wish they would have recorded the talking in between songs. It annoyed me when I would hear the audience applauding, then dead silence as they cut over to the other song. There was too much dead air on this &quot;live&quot; CD for my taste.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I bought these for my Sony mini-disc player, and they are quite the powerhouse! The sound that comes out of these little guys is amazing. These little phones are a tad awkaward (FOR ME),though, because I always snag the wires on something, but it's my fault. I am never too careful with wires. Speaking of wires, the cable has a volume slide-control whuich is very convenient for when you don'r feel like pulling the player out of your pocket to turn up the volume. That is, when not using the remote.<br />Sony always makes good products, and like always, I am pleased with my purchase. With good compactability, I can pack these guys in my backpack, and because they are so flexible, they still retain their shape and excellent sound and performance standards.<br />Let's talk about bass. The bass expansion is great and because of the volume control slider, you don't have to go deaf because you forgot to turn down the volume (on your player) prior to using it.<br />Not only ismodel MDR08L great for MD players/recorders, but it's also great for cassette and Discman's too! Especially when you don't want a heavy, cumbersome headset weighing you down while on the go. And, the plain black color goes well with any of the portable players today.<br />So, for the price and the brand, get this headset or something similar by Sony today.<br />Hope the review helped you.
0060977264|5.0|This is an excellent combination of love and a higher calling.  It challenges the reader to question their own preconceived notions of love and spirituality.  I could not put it down.  Coelho takes you to Spain and leaves you longing to be by the river experiencing the beauty of the Goddess.  I recommend this to anyone who considers themselves to be a romantic, regardless of your spiritual walk.  Also, I recommend it to those who consider themselves to be spiritual warriors.  It speaks to both the same and touches the soul.
B00005AAFS|5.0|In an age where a band has to conform to the American Market by singing in English, Rammstein has not followed that path. Instead they have remain true to their sound and style and continue to do what they enjoy to do while still enjoying success in the states. All this and singing in a foreign but awesome language, German. That speaks volumes.<br />&quot;Mutter&quot; is their best album to date and is a cross between their previous albums &quot;Herzeleid&quot; and &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; but with an added freshness to bring in 2001. I recommend anyone who likes their past material to check this album out! They even turned my wife on to them and she isn't the greatest fan of heavy metal. Once you push play, you will get a surge of energy and adrenaline you haven't felt since the early days of Metallica.<BR>Lang Lebend Rammstein! (Long Live Rammstein!)
0743442539|5.0|Arguably the best spy novel ever written.  It was out of print for years.  I envy the readers who can now buy this newly printed copy.  I had to make due with a decades old moldy copy that fell apart as I read it.  Not that I'm complaining--I loved the book!  Le Carre knows his spy stuff.  This is not some techno-filled, action-packed, lets-throw-in-a-plot-twist-for-the-h@ll-of-it book.  This is a tightly-packed page turner that will lead you by the hand in the beginning and then drop a piano on you at the end.  Le Carre's heroes are not Bond, they are overworked, overweight, underpaid, highly intelligent characters who love their country.  This book was one of Le Carre's first books, and I feel his very best.  The &quot;winners&quot; and &quot;losers&quot; are blurred in the spy game, and this book clearly illustrates that point.  If you want to get a feel for what real Cold War spy work was all about, read this book.  Highly recommended.
B000001GPX|5.0|If you have listened to Beethoven's 5th symphony a thousand times and not listened to this recording, you have been missing out on one of the most singular listening experiences there is. The Vienna Philharmonic is as alive and as inviting as I have heard them on disc. The strings soar; the horns shout in defiance!  Without a doubt, one of the 10 greatest recordings of any work ever recorded.  Why there isn't a complete Beethoven symphony cycle from Klieber and the VPO is truely one of recorded music's biggest tragedies.  When I bought this recording as a teenager I hesitated because it only had a little over 30 minutes of material (only the 5th) at full (not middle) price. The seventh, included in this release, is a nice compliment to the 5th. The amazing thing is you get both at a better price than I happily paid for many years ago. Don't hesitate.
B0000028VT|5.0|&quot;Music Box&quot; is one of Mariahs strongest albums to date. This album produced three number one hits for her but there were also songs that werent released that were amazing. &quot;Never Forget You&quot; is one of the many ballads on this album that touches the heart. For anyone missing a loved one this is the song for them! and &quot;All I've Ever Wanted&quot; this ballad is truly and deeply amazing, I words cant describe this song. All together this album is the best album ever in history.
B00005R87Q|1.0|If this were 1957 and Roger Corman had made &quot;Fast and Furious,&quot; it would have been entitled &quot;Hot Rods From Hell&quot; and shown up in your local RKO at the bottom of a bill that featured &quot;Creature From The Black Lagoon&quot;<br />What can you say about a movie whose most compelling line of dialouge is &quot;I  bet there's at least 10 grand under that hood!&quot;<br />I know a 23 year old college student who shaved his head bald, so impressed was he with the Vin Diesel character.<br />It's a good thing he didn't go to see &quot;Shrek&quot;

The most strongest and best tracks on here were &quot;Split Personality&quot; &quot;Love is such a Crazy Thing&quot; &quot;Private Show&quot; and the best ballads of all time aside from Mariah's ballads, &quot;Stop Falling&quot; this ballad is absolutly powerful and it shows of Pinks vocal chords. You simply have to buy this album!
B00005ASQ1|2.0|Despite the talent of its main actors, this movie was nothing but cliche. Every section of the storyline was predictable (e.g. the boy is told not to do something, and he does it), not to mention tacky Hollywood sub-plots (the boy's love interest, the man's sorrowful past, the school wanting the boy for his basketball ability). Half of this movie feels like deja vu, after 'Good Will Hunting'.<br />And it's such a shame, because Rob Brown (the lead actor who wasn't even an actor when he got the part) is so very talented. Let's hope he gets another chance to make a good movie. Thumbs down.
B00005N83M|5.0|I must admit that I am not a big fan of Miss. Lopez's singing but I am of her acting. I bought this album because I had the first and once you get the first you have to get the rest. This album I really liked. Jennifer has what is called &quot;the studio voice&quot; and that studio voice really worked for this album. This is the perfect album to dance to. Songs like &quot;Love Don't Cost a Thing&quot; and &quot;Play&quot; are extremly good but the best songs on this album are &quot;That's Not Me&quot; &quot;Aint It Funny&quot; &quot;Dance&quot; and &quot;Thats The Way&quot; are the best and most highligted songs recoreded on this album. I am one satisfied customer!
B00005R87Q|1.0|(Studio Exec.): \\"Hey, let's make a \\"Point Break\\" remake, but this time with 'Cars' instead of 'Surf Boards'! They (the average movie-goer) will never know!\\"<br />Let's see, Paul Walker (Keanu Reaves), is an undercover cop (FBI Agent), who is trying to solve Car Thefts (Bank Robberies), so he befriends a likely suspect, Vin Diesel (Patrick Swayze), the member of a street racing cult (Surf Boarding Gang). The movie was not well done, poorly acted, written, directed; you name it.  Here's a few rants about this debacle:<br />>>> Are there any police in this city?  They race all over town with no law enforcement in sight.<br />>>> Not only that, but for argument's sake, let's say that there's actually on ongoing investigation for these people.  Don't you think it'd be easy to spot these neon, six-figure racing cars in town?  \\"...okay, I've spotted a lime-green, orange Porsche Turbo XLT with turqoise striping...\\"  Run an APB on this or something?  Come on.<br />>>> By the way, how can you race down dozens of city blocks in the middle of the day without a single bystander or car in the way? \\"...alright, guys, the coast is clear...\\"\\"<br />>>> \\"...he's a burned out cop, and the only chance anyone's got...\\"  Please.  Paul Walker is maybe 20 years old, and he's an undercover cop?  Doesn't it take like 10 years + to get promoted to this level?<br />>>> Who are these women?  Do chicks really dig undercover racing cults?  And are they all drop dead hot?<br />>>> These racers are all 18-21 years old, yet somehow able to afford $(...)racing cars?<br />>>> The special effects were unforgivable.  I could have sworn some of the close ups were actually animated.<br />Anyways, I know, I know, \\"don't fight the movie,\\"  it's just mindless entertainment.  Well, it failed at even accomplishing this.  Rent \\"Point Break\\" instead.  It's a classic action flick that actually has some compelling moments and interesting characters and dialogue.  \\"The Fast and the Furious\\" lacked everything possible.  Save your $4.

B00000FCBC|5.0|Some might say that the new covers are out of character for Metallica.<br />NO WAY IN HELL!!<br />Take \\"Astronamy\\" for example. It was written by Blue Oyster Cult and influenced Jason Newsted the most. If you read the booklet, you will find that Jason saw those guys live many times one summer. The only reason Metallica covered Turn The Page was because of the lyrics. Lars said, \\"That song had James Hetfield written all over it.\\" Now, Die Die My Darling is pretty heavy, and is most likly a tribute to Cliff, since that was all the band listened to on their way the Master Of Puppets photo shoots. <br />I'm sure I don't have to comment on the second disc because it has been out for a while on other releases. Except for the live Motorhead covers. This was done in '95 as a tribute Lemmy, and his 50th birthday. What else can I say...?
B00005QZ7U|5.0|It was good. I think they could have taken out 30 minutes of singing. I really liked the basic love story. There was a lot of Drag and crap like that they could have taken out.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Regardless of what kind of music you listen to, this CD will reel you in, hold your attention and steal your heart. This is one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. The tracks play in the same order as the film score, which explains the duplication of &quot;Constant Sorrow&quot;. In addition to the Soggy Mtn. Boys tracks, the songs with Alison Krauss are the highlights on this CD.  Thanks to Joel and Ethan Coen and to T-Bone for making a landmark CD.

B00005TT77|2.0|I only purchased this CD for the cover of &quot;Hide Your Love Away&quot; performed by Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam. It, along with the Aimee Mann's &quot;Two Of Us&quot; are the only two songs worth having. The other performances are either overproduced, or the vocalists are forcing themselves to try and sound like Lennon. Had I realized the entire CD was Beatles covers...<br />I give the CD a 0, with Eddie and Aimee's tracks as a 5. If there were a CD single, I would have gotten it instead.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Whoever compares Shakira to Britney Spears is seriously disturbed! Yes, putting her in the same category might help with record sales -- but this Latin chick's music is not bubble gum fluff. Her lyrics speak volumes and her music is unique. I have been listening to her music since she first came out and she is more like an upbeat version of Alanis Morrisett.<br />A mixture of pop and Latin rock, Shakira's Laundry Service offers the formula for crossover success without losing her roots. &quot;Whenever, Wherever,&quot; the CD's leading single, is my favorite track. I also love &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot; and &quot;Objection (Tango).&quot; Her songs make you dance, appreciate the lyrics and her vocal talent at the same time.<br />Are you in the bargain for some great music? Do you like Shakira? Then what are you waiting for? Pick up this CD! Listening to the entire collection will make you realize that Shakira is no Britney Spears -- and that is a compliment!

B00004U28G|5.0|The best comedic car race movie ever; even when you consider some action scenes from Driven and Days of Thunder.<br />First watching this movie, you know your in for a treat as almost every actor and actress of the all-star acting cast allowed themselves to conduct parodies of their best movie roles. Burt Reynolds played a character very similar to has acclaimed role in Smokey and the Bandit. Roger Moore, best known for being 007 and The Saint, used his debonair qualities to create a hillarious series of self-humilating scenes having fun with the staples of his career. <br />Although other great talents have also thrown themselves behind The Cannonball Run. Farrah Fawcett, a drop-dead funny two-thirds of the &quot;Rat Pack&quot; with Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean Martin as well as a younger Jackie Chan driving a Japan entry to the race.<br />Start your engines for of race of humor.

Besides, we weren't really expecting oscar material, right?  Looking at the other reviews on this site, apparently girls only need a couple of hot guys in the movie to be happy.  So sad. Maybe this is actually a chick flick?<br />Anyways kiddies, review these lessons and use the enclosed coupons on your Toyotas, Hondas and Acuras.

B00003CXXP|2.0|In my book, A.I. was a huge disappointment. Not to say that I don't recommend it, because it is a very interesting film. But when the only message you take away from the film is that &quot;People Are Bad, Mean, and Selfish,&quot; how uplifting are you going to feel after you watch it.<br />Many claim that the film teachs us about the dangers of technology, and if we make it too realistic, if we program machines to love us, can we love them back? The anwser the film gives is no, but you're asking the wrong question.<br />Haley Joel Osment's David was programed to love Monica, so when Monica decided she didn't want to love him anymore, David HAD to keep loving her. He didn't have a choice in the matter, because that was his programing. He never felt what it was like to be a human, because he could do nothing but try to find Monica. It's not about the robot's love, because he never really loved her. He was TOLD to love her.<br />Everything else in A.I. revolves around this, but if we're suppose to care about David the robot, why couldn't David had actually cared about Monica. Finding her was only to complete a task in his programming, and would not actually give him any emotional pleasure.<br />David was emotionally disconnected from Monica, and I was emotionally disconnected from this film.
0790729652|5.0|Batman is a wonderful story, people tend to forget that stories in the world of cinema start right off from frame one, rather than creating a story. Tim Burton's visual mastery in Batman is perfect. Batman is one of those perfect movies. Great all the way through. Jack Nicholson, Michael Keaton and even Jack Palance all help this movie become a living, breathing essence! And to not mention Danny Elfman's best score of all-time bar-none, would be of criminal caliber. Best superhero movie ever!<br />I saw this three times in the theater, and hundreds more on video.
B00003CX5P|2.0|Well, I received a copy of this DVD for Christmas, and I must admit I enjoyed all the many extras such as the extended pod race, the documentary, and so on.  But it's still the same mediocre film, clearly designed from the start with marketing toys to 10 year olds rather than paying homage to a wonderful series of films.  Now it's been said that Lucas intentioanlly made the first film a light one, in anticipation of the much more darker films to follow.  That's fine with me, but the problems still continue to leap out at me evry time I watch it.  It's clear Darth Maul is a professional swordsman (which is why he has little dialogue), unfortunatly it becomes all to clear in the fight scenes that this guy could easily take out our heroes in about 3 seconds.  Midiclorians??? Why in God's name does Hollywood think we need an actual explanation for the force?  It was the force's mystical and unknown qualities that made the first films special in the first place.  And don't even get me started with Jar Jar.  It's quite possible this film could have been right up there with the others were it not for him.  Let's hope the second installment gets the story back on track.
B00003CXXS|4.0|This was a very fun movie, seeing Sam Neill back was great, but as a fan of the first two movies, Jurassic Park III seemed too short and didn't seem to have very satisfying action, except for the short but sweet airplane attack by the Spinosaurus. The Spinosaurus Vs. T-Rex fight was very cool, but also too short. <BR>The best shot in the movie however, was when the raptors were shown running in the open field. Jurassic Park is my favorite movie, Lost World was a great sequel, but Jurassic Park III didn't quite capture the magic of those previous dino-fests.
B00005JKQX|5.0|My favorite thing about this film, next to excellent directing (yet again) by Ron Howard and another camillion role by Russell Crowe, is the way it so beautifully illustrates an important issue.  We all have things that we have to &quot;deal&quot; with inside ourselves - some more blatant than others.  And each day we have to choose how we are going to deal with that thing today - it never goes away.  For some of us, it is an addiction that we are dealing with.  For others, it may be a behavioral pattern that we have developed.  Every time a temptation or a situation arises to test that particular thing, we have to decide how we are going to deal with that.<br />Nash, the character that Crowe plays, has to deal with such a problem.  And in this film we get to see how he chooses to deal with it - each and every day.  Many of us like to think that these issues will just go away.  But what most of us find, is that they do not go away and we have to choose over and over again how we are going to deal with our issues.
B00004U8JV|5.0|I rank this as one of the best sequels ever made. First off, Spielberg loads tons of action in here, great scenes ranging from the trailer scene to the San Diego incident. Spielberg has crafted a pop-corn ride of a movie far more entertaining than any boring Romance movie.<br />The T-Rexes in this one contain poignant moments in special effects history. One of my favorite shots is when Sarah tries to help Kelly up to rush into the water-fall, with the female T-Rex nearly snatching them. Other great CGI moments are the raptor shots and ofcourse the round-up sequence. The raptors sounded a bit different from the last film, aswell as looked more tiger-skinned than the plain grey. The stegosaurus moments were exciting aswell.  <br />Steven Spielberg made this film for the fans like me, and I personally think it delivered in spades! When I first saw this <BR>in the theater I wasn't quite sure wether it was my all-time favorite movie, topping the first Jurassic Park. It was so much fun.
B000002LCU|4.0|No doubt one of George Harrison's best solo efforts., Cloud Nine is full of memorable album cuts like &quot;Devil's Radio&quot; and &quot;That's What it Takes&quot;, and includes 2 hit singles; &quot;I Got My Mind Set On You,&quot; and &quot;When We Was Fab,&quot; George's anthem about the Beatle years. The album has seemed to be in short supply lately so pick it up now while you still can.
B00000K2SC|2.0|This movie is the most disappointing film that I have seen. That doesn't mean it was the worst, just disappointing after such high hopes for it.  <BR> It has horrible actors. Keanu Reeves should really not be allowed to play any parts that involve speaking.  The lines Trinity (Carry-Anne Moss) are rather uninspiringly lame, akward, and sound so unnatural when she speaks.<BR> The story is based on an interesting idea, that challenges our idea of life. However, the way that it was developed was so terrible.  The movie focused more on something that would have cool effects, than something important. The ending was probably the worst. It was dumb, horribly disappointing, and it almost seemed as the director was shooting for generic.<BR> Even most bland action movies at least had cool action sequences if nothing else. The millions of dollars for computer special effects actually detracted from the movie. Most things in the movie, like  the fight scene between Neo and Morphius, looked slow and very synthetic.  You do have to hand it to the special effects department for some cool looking graphics. <BR> In summary: horrible story +story development, uninspiring script, terrible acting, and slow and artificial action.  If you still believe in a good story over overpaid visuals, you should definetly stay clear.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|How old are the people writing the bad reviews? Even my 50 year old father enjoyed this movie emensly! I watched the movie knowing what to expect from Baz, my friend however did not. We were both completely blown away! Everything was amazing, the colors, the costumes, the sets, the characters! You loved and hated the right people in all the right spots. You laugh, you cry, you cheer! What more could you ask from a movie? This is by far one of the greatest movies I have EVER seen! And the more you watch the more you find that amuses you! (Watch it again and don't be afraid of the rewind and pause buttons!) It just doesn't get much better than this!
B00000721J|4.0|It's always interesting to me how albums appear in retrospect, many years after their initial release. I first purchased this recording when it was originally out in 1970. I was blown away by &quot;Maybe I'm Amazed&quot; and liked several other songs on it. But I was a little disappointed at the time by this recorded-at-home offering. It lacked a certain polish that would be expected of one of the Beatles. Now, however, looking at McCartney's entire career and seeing this album as part of his history and evolution as an artist, I've come to regard it a fine effort and a worthy addition to anyone's CD collection.<br />Paul plays all the instruments here, making use of a Studer multitrack recorder he had parked in a corner of his living room in order to overdub the various parts. Standout tracks include the beautiful and plaintive &quot;Junk,&quot; as well as its instrumental counterpart &quot;Singalong Junk,&quot; &quot;Hot As Sun/Glasses,&quot; &quot;Every Night&quot; and, of course, the aforementioned masterpiece, &quot;Maybe I'm Amazed&quot;--which alone is worth the price of the CD. These days, it's the live version of the latter, which became a hit in the late 70s, that seems to get all the airplay. But the original version will always stand out for me as the definitive and best one. Even the somewhat odd &quot;Kreen Akore&quot; has a wonderful, searing lead solo. (Paul is a much-underrated lead guitarist.)  For me, the only real clunker here is &quot;That Would Be Something,&quot; which isn't bad; it just doesn't have much going for it. There are several other nice numbers to round out the CD. While not on par with his very best effort--&quot;Band on the Run&quot;--which was yet to come a few years later, and though intentionally under-produced in comparison with the average studio recording, this CD is a must have for any McCartney fan. Buy it and enjoy!
B00004U2GH|5.0|How punk is Johnny Cash?  That is what I kept thinking listening to this completely awe inspiring performance.  My tastes have always tended more towards the Dead Kennedys and this is the first country album I have ever owned but I can't wait to get Live at Folsom Prison next.  You have to be seriously hard to pull something like this off.  Watch out Green Day, if more young kids get ahold of this you're out of business.

B00005NW02|3.0|well, first of all, who is this malakian guy?  I dont seem to remember him on the first album...but ok, I guess he is the leader of the band now.  anyways, the music is decaying.  I think they are trying too hard for it to sound melodic.  Each song has the System sound, but it doesn't take you anywhere.  the first album, just about everysong moved you, emotionally and physically because the songs were so dynamic, but now, this cd, the songs are all structured the same way, it seems that system has niether improved nor moved on with their sound.  there are a few songs that are really good, those are &quot;Shimmy,&quot; &quot;Chop Suey!&quot; and &quot;Aerials&quot;  those are the ones that I would reccommend, others on this album are just as good, ifnot worse than the first album.  I would much rather listen to the first album instead of this album.  To me it just seems like they quit writing dynamic songs.  thats just me tho.  I think if they kicked out this Malakian guy they might have a chance at creativity again.  Something is definitely different about this album.  Maybe after listening to it a hundred times more might help me like it more.  It almost seems like they didn't learn anything new, and they just made a part 2 to their first cd, which isn't bad, but then again it isn't good.<BR>-winston
B000003TAL|5.0|DN is so great. I love all the songs in it. All of them is excellent. My fav song in this album is the sprawl. The sprawl is 1 of the best song i ever listened in my whole life.
B00005JKQX|5.0|It's one of the best movies that I've seen in a long time.  Russell Crowe is very believable in the lead role.  He should be nominated for an acamedy award.

All things must pass indeed but I think people will be listening to this music for as long as the human race survives and we have ears. In whatever format. This is a wonderful disc. I think George's best solo work and right up there with The Beatles. I REALLY REALLY LOVE the instrumentals they flat out ROCK. You really MUST have this disc. Thanks George goodbye
6300263673|5.0|Dirty Dancing is one of my favorite movies. Its a lot like Grease. I don't know which one I like better. It has great songs, great acting, and great dancing. Thats probably why they named it Dirty DANCING. It is very fun to watch and you could never get sick of it. This is one movie that will live on.
B00003CXTG|3.0|By announcing itself as absolutely, irreproachably authentic and realistic when it is obviously anything but, PEARL HARBOR doesn't so much invite invite criticism as flat-out begs for it. Both story and script are a mixture of Hollywood stereotype and bad dialogue. At one point during the attack at Pearl Harbor, a character says, \\"I think World War II just started!\\" and this is rather typical of the movie as a whole: obviously improbable, assuming the audience knows nothing, and flogging every clich&eacute; to the nth degree. Even so, the lead actors have enough appeal and some of those stereotypes and cliches are still powerful enough to keep the film watchable, and the battle sequences are visually impressive.<br />PEARL HARBOR is a soap opera concerning a love triangle between two friends and a beautiful navy nurse. This plot line, which occupies the first third of the film, asks us to believe the proverbial six impossible things before breakfast and predictably reaches a peak just in time for the Japanese attack. The second third of the film shows the attack itself. I cannot say how accurate the film is in its details of the assault (although I did have enough sense to wonder what happened to the second wave); it is, however, excitingly filmed and it is easily the most successful portion of the film. And yet, it is here the film falls completely apart by allowing our two male leads to usurp the roles of the two real-life men who actually managed to get planes off the ground. Predictably, our heros perform all sorts of acrobatics, blow Japanese Zeros all over the sky, and survive to return to the woman they love: Hollywood unreality at its most ludicrous.<br />The last third of the film is total nonsense. Our two pilots (who have by now been childhood friends, gone to flight school together, become pilots together, fallen in love with the same woman together, and survived Pearl Harbor together) are now asked to volunteer for the Doolittle Raid on Japan--and by this point viewers may actually begin to wonder why they are bothering with the nurse. They seem more like lovers than buddies. Ultimately, the film is affecting almost in spite of itself, but you have to put your mind on total hold to enjoy it. It isn't \\"THE\\" Pearl Harbor film--that title still properly belongs to \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\"<br />The DVD contains a History Channel documentary re Pearl Harbor that is very good, a \\"Making Of\\" documentary that is disgracefully and distastefully self-congratulatory, and a number of other extras, some of which you will need a computer to access. The picture quality and sound are excellent throughout. Sadly, the movie itself is not.nt viewers may actually begin to wonder why they are bothering with the nurse.

B00003CXXI|5.0|Anyone who has seen this movie can't help but be charmed by it. My 19 month old daughter and I watch it every night (literally) and have done so every night since receiving it at Christmas.  It's charming, funny, and filled with many positive messages.
B000002UEB|5.0|It is.  Concept albums seem to cycle in popularity; everyone likes them, then they don't.  Operation mindcrime bucks that trend.  This one is great all the time and has all the elements: murder, cultism, social revolution, treachery etc.<br />This album is intense and is one heck of a story!!
B000002KBU|5.0|No album is more important to me than Joni Mitchell's 1971 masterpiece &quot;Blue.&quot;  As is rare with most albums, Joni has created each song to be a classic work of art in itself, telling stories that transcend generations of thought.  I feel this to be Joni's most personal and reflective work.  It has to be-- her lyrics and intricate melodies come across as though she is singing us a series of paintings about her life.  These songs have to be real-- no one could even begin to imagine the senses she brings across on this album.<BR>   My personal favorites onthis album are the two songs that I consider to be her best songs ever.  &quot;A Case of You&quot; is my very favorite song of hers.  What can one say about it?  It is sheer beauty listening to her heart spill out to this guy in the song.  I also love &quot;The Last Time I Saw Richard.&quot;  Only Joni could take something that would just cross most people's minds as a mere thought and turn it into the most beautiful song.<BR>   But even though these are my two favorite songs, I believe every song is wonderful!  &quot;All I Want&quot; is the Joni telling the world how much fun she is.  (I wanna wreck my stockings in some jukebox dive...)  &quot;My Old Man&quot; is such a very personal expression of love at its rawest form.  (We don't need no piece of paper from the city hall keeping us tied and true.)  &quot;Little Green&quot; is perhaps Joni's most personal song ever, expressing her grief over giving up her daughter.  (So you sign all the papers in the family name, you're sad and you're sorry but you're not ashamed.)  &quot;Carey&quot; is a great song about love and sacrifice.  (My fingernails are filthy, I've got beachtar on my feet, and I miss that clean white linen and that fancy French cologne...)  &quot;Blue&quot; can take you absolutely anywhere you want it to, which makes it a great lonely night song!  (Blue, there is a shell for you, Inside you'll hear a sigh, a foggy lullaby.  There is your song from me.)  &quot;California&quot; is my personal vote for Joni's most fun song, revealing change.  (I'm gonna see the folks I dig, maybe I'll kiss a sunset pig.)  My third favorite song on the album is &quot;This Flight Tonight&quot; about regret and love's confusing realm.  (Up got the flaps, down go the wheels.  I hope you got your heat turned on baby.)  And finally, &quot;River&quot; is the best example of Joni's longing for better things in the world.  (I wish I had a river I could skate away on...)<BR>   I could go on and on about Joni's &quot;Blue&quot;.  Just get it and you'll understand why it is the most essential album in my collection and in my life.
0792833201|5.0|POLTERGEIST remains one of the all-time classic horror films ever created, credited no doubt to Tobe Hooper and Steven Spielberg.<br />Here we meet the all-American Freeling family; the parents (Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams), older daughter (the late Dominique Dunn), younger brother (Oliver Robins) and little Carol Anne (the late Heather O'Rourke).  Things become strange when storms and household occurances wreak terror over the household, culminating in the abduction of Carol Anne through a portal in the closet.<br />A kindly investigator of the paranormal (Beatrice Straight) and medium Tangina Barrons (Zelda Rubinstein) are called in to clean the house of the spirits that plague it and to rescue Carol Anne from the &quot;TV people&quot;...<br />A heart-stopping adventure with breathtaking special effects.  Followed by POLTERGEIST II-THE OTHER SIDE and finally POLTERGEIST 3 which was released after Heather O'Rourke's untimely death.
B000002O7C|5.0|Wow. This is a must have. You like Conan the Barbarian? Well, you'll like this one too. What that score did for fantasy adventure, this does for Russian patriotism and action.<br />From the rousing and beautiful &quot;Hymn to Red October&quot; to the great variation of the theme in &quot;Nuclear Scam&quot;, which also serves as the end credits music from the movie I believe, each piece is a pleasure to listen to. &quot;Putin's Demise&quot; has a dreamy quality to it, despite being way too short, and &quot;Chopper&quot; is probably the most electronic sounding of the selection. &quot;Ancestral Aids&quot; also has a great variation of the main theme as it is played along, and &quot;Red Route 1&quot;, being one of the longer tracks, has some beautiful tunes as well. There is a great lyrical quality to it at parts and some harps can be heard in it. I believe this music plays in the film as the submarine is maneuvering itself along the bottom of the ocean, but unfortunately it ends pretty abruptly. &quot;Plane Crash&quot; starts out quiet and has a very loud and harsh part that just screams disaster.<br />Even if you don't like the briefness of the short tracks (two are under one minute), you still must get this CD if only for the main theme in &quot;Hymn to Red October&quot; and &quot;Nuclear Scam&quot;. Its for any fan of Poledouris, any fan of the movie, any fan of Russian sounds, and any fan of great film score music.
B000002U9L|5.0|both the movie and the soundtrack bring back pleasant memories of my chilhood. the soundtrack is perfect, a labyrinth fan couldn't ask for anything more.
B00004RFFM|4.0|This movie is very entertaining and suspenseful. It's one of those movies that never stops shooting out action. However, it IS alittle hypocritical: When the underground palace is filling with water, one minute LL Cool J is looking at a porno magazine wishing to stay alive, then the next minute he's clutching his crucifix praying that he'll live. <BR>If you want an exciting, action-shooting shark attack advanture, then this is the movie for you.
0451191153|5.0|If you want to read this book only to entertain yourselves then this book will not serve you. If you are traditional and like the idea of following what your previous generations have done and followed and treat them with awe or consider them respect without reasoning them out then this book will help you an encounter with a totally opposite realm of ideas. I will not say that it will be interesting to you. It is either possible that you undergo a paradigm shift or you hate the ideas presented in the book and write up a review loathing what is presented in the book. If you are moderate and do not have strong conviction on any idea then you may find the book whimsically nice and not pragmatic. And if you are the person who does not believe in tradition, culture or anything for that matter except reason then this book is a must read. If you are an architect irrespective of what genre you belong to it will serve you better to read this book. <br />The philosophy of the book is simple but strong.<br />Just by virtue of the fact that man is born in a society it should not mean that he is a slave of the society by blindly accepting whatever the society thrusts on him or his ideas. He or she should think for himself and have his/her own convictions on things. An illustrious point can be, just by virtue of your being born to your parents, it should not mean that you should learn the subjects your parents choose for you or marry <BR>the girl/boy your parents choose for you, and so on...<br />The individual should live for himself; he should have his own ideas; he should do things for himself. Only if there are such individuals can a society improve. <br />The words selfishness, egotism and collectivism used the book are in a subtler sense and do not carry the popular meaning and have to be understood from the context. Even in this age when team-work is the word of the day the ideas presented <BR>in the book will still hold good, for without individuals who can stand their ground there cannot be a good team. The denunciation of collectivism is only in the spirit of saying that &quot;too many cooks spoil the broth&quot;.<br />I feel that the plot and the characters in the book have been fastidiously built to bring out the philosophy of Ayn Rand which pitchforks individualism and reason to the top of all ideas and beliefs.
B00005NNT1|5.0|This movie is a wonderful classic that is now remade in to a clearer view.  You'll love Snow White and those seven little dwarfs.  Everyone has got to at least seen a clip of it.  When the new version was released, everyone got up and about to buy it.  Please, I recommend that you either buy or see this wonderful masterpiece.  I heard that their starting to lock up Snow White for another decade.  The movie will be very limited.
B00005TT77|5.0|I am one of many who believe the Beatles are the greatest band ever and it saddens me that they can no longer record their music  This group of songs gives me hope for the future.  The various renditions are true to the originals without being mere apings.  The artists allow their own musical styles to surface while paying respect to the originals by not changing the overall tone of the songs.  Blackbird by Sarah McLachlan is the best version I have ever heard, and is worth price of the CD.
B00003CXXP|5.0|I AM STARTING BY PROUDLY STATING THAT AI IS THE MOST AMAZING MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN. THE MOVIE WAS AMAZING AND IT LEFT ME ALONG WITH THE ENTIRE THEATER IN TEARS. TEARS IN A GOOD WAY BECAUSE THE MOVIE TOUCHED MY HEART. NEVER BEFORE HAVE I BEEN SO AFFECTED BY A MOVIE. THE ENDING OF THE MOVIE WAS MY FAVORITE PART AND THE PART THAT TOUCHED ME THE MOST. I SAT NEXT TO MY SON AND THE TEARS FLOWED DOWN OUR FACES FOR THE LAST 1O MINUTES OF THE MOVIE. BEING A MOTHER OF AN 8 YEAR OLD, THE ENDING STRUCK A CORD IN MY HEART.ANY MOTHER WHO TRULY LOVED HER CHILD WILL BE ESPECIALLY MOVED BY THE ENDING. MY 8 YEAR OLD WHO ALSO LOVED THE MOVIE TOLD ME IT BROUGHT HIM CLOSER TO ME AND I FEEL THE SAME WAY. THE MOVIE SHOWS HOW QUICKLY LIFE PASSES YOU BY AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO SHOW LOVE TO THE ONES YOU LOVE. I LEFT THE THEATRE WITH A FEELING OF PEACE AND CLOSENESS TO MY SON. I WAS AMAZED AT THE EFFECT AI HAD ON ME. AI IS FOR THE EMOTIONAL MOVIEGOER AND THE ONE WHO IS NOT AFRAID TO OPEN THEIR HEART. THIS IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME AND I AM COUNTING THE DAYS UNTIL I CAN BUY THE DVD. I WILL CHERISH IT AS I TRULY CHERISH THE THEATRE EXPERIENCE.
B000003RCY|5.0|This album kicks, pure and simple. It is a hard rockin' pulse poundin' CD that you're sure to love.
B00005MP58|5.0|Five hours plus of Colin et al., need I say more...  I thought this was just a wonderful DVD set.  The color and picture quality on my DVDs were just great, perhaps I have a different edition than the people who have been disappointed in that regard. The Featurette was a nice surprise - women who love &quot;Darcy's Dive&quot; will be happy to see the extra shots of Colin filming that scene (it's not my favorite, but I certainly understand it's appeal!).  If you loved the miniseries this DVD set is a must have!
B0000057C5|5.0|This has got to be the best CD out there.  I love it.  It all started a couple of years ago when someone in my German class played &quot;Engel&quot;.  I thought it sounded really cool, so a little while later, I went and bought this CD.  Now I am hooked on Rammstein.  And it really is not music you can get sick of.  All of my other music, I'll listen to for a while and then it sits around and collects dust until I decide I need to listen to it again.  Not Rammstein.  I'm always listening to it.  I might actually wear out my CD, a very hard, next to impossible task.  From my personal favorite, Engel, to the popular Du Hast, to the softer Klavier, to the english song Stripped (not even mentioned in the contents; it's just there at the end of the CD), there is something you're bound to love.
B00005A1PR|5.0|This CD is absolutely amazing. The acousic, vocal, and rythmic aspects of this album stir my heart and soul. She is just fabulous and is so unique. You have to get this CD-I know all the words to all the songs. Also, I never get tired of it. So inspriational, so great!!
B00005AAFS|5.0|This is a very good album of Rammstein.  It has a different sound than what we may be used to out of them.  It isn't quite as harsh as their other two albums, so those of you who listen to Rammstein for the harsh music and growling lyrics may be a little disapointed.  But I enjoyed it as much as the others.  It is still Rammstein, pure and simple.  They just happen to bring in a few extras to give it a little boost.  Buy this album, you won't be disapointed.
B00005O5JV|4.0|When I first saw this movie with my teenage son, I admit that my expectations were not particularly high. Was I ever pleasantly surprised by this delightfully funny comedy! Reese Witherspoon does a star turn as the not so dumb, California airhead blonde, Ellie Woods, who is dumped by her college sweetheart, Warner, before graduation, instead of getting the anticipated and expected marriage proposal. It appears that he has political aspirations and an ostensibly dumb and flamboyant blonde is not what he envisions having for a wife.<br /><br />Seeking to prove herself worthy and knowing that he is planning on attending Harvard Law School, Ellie, a fashion major, also seeks admission with dogged determination and studies her charming buns off in order to do well on the LSAT, the Law School Admission Test. Her high LSAT scores, coupled with her hilarious admission video, and her perfect college grade point average, albeit in Fashion,  get her through the portals of Harvard Law School, and the games begin in earnest.<br /><br />What happens to her at Harvard is hilarious, as Ellie tries to get her former sweetheart back. She discovers, instead, something about herself that ultimately makes others sit up and take notice of her in a positive way. Reese Witherspoon is delightfully funny doing a comic turn and will have the viewer laughing almost immediately, while rooting for her. The supporting cast is likewise enjoyable. This is a funny, wacky comedy that is never mean spirited and is, instead, surprisingly uplifting.
0446310786|4.0|A homegrown novel that tells the story of several children living with a single father in less than desirable conditions. The novel carries a powerful message.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|Tomb Raider is a film you must see.  Angelina was the perfect Lara Croft.  It has lots if action.  It is a non-bloody film, that would probably be ok for most kids older than 10.<BR>  It has a good story to it.  And they used the real father Jon Voight.  See This.
B000021Y77|5.0|Very inventive movie and reminds me of Kieslowski, without the Catholic baggage, in that we see how randmom life is<BR>and how small encounters and slight changes in timing can significantly alter one's life and others (without our even being aware of it).<br />This is an interesting ( but not new  ) idea to think about, yet it is cleverly presented in an aesthetically pleasing manner in this film.  This movie has all the elements of a classic cult film.
6305127638|5.0|Someone tell me again WHY they aren't all this good?<br />What GOES on at Paramount that the every other one is soul-less.<br />This and Wrath of Khan are by far the best of the entrie string.<br />Got PLOT, great dialogue, action, humor, its' not missing on any pistons.<br />Instead of watching the bad ones watch the good ones over again.
B00005B36H|5.0|Not having heard any of Tool before I bought the album, I am pretty new to their music and all I can say is that if any of their other albums are half as good as this they all deserve 5 stars aswell. Lateralus is a trip the whole way through, emotionally moving. My personal favourites are &quot;Lateralus&quot;, Parabol/Parabola&quot;,&quot;schism&quot;, &quot;reflection&quot;, &quot;the Grudge&quot; and &quot;eon Blue Apocolypse/The Patient&quot;. The only song I skip over is &quot;Ticks and Leeches&quot; and that is only because I can't listen to it ever time I listen to the CD. As this release is an HDCD the quality of it is astounding, brilliantly layered. As someone so rightly said Tool is the Radiohead of Metal Music
6305263248|5.0|Amazing car chases through some very beautiful scenery.<br />Deniro is completely believable as an old spy, Jena reno is equally great as always. Both on the same screen is just a bonus.<br />Sean Bean as a creepy wanna be.  Frankenheimer still has what todays directors need to learn.
0385505833|5.0|This is a totally new genre for Grisham..... but I was not at all disappointed! I was given this book by my friend to read during my flight from Chicago to San Antonio. What a great way to enjoy my trip! It had me laughing aloud to the point of tears! It was so easy to visualize the scenes.... it would make a great holiday animated cartoon! Don't miss the opportunity to truly be entertained!
B00003CY0V|1.0|Putting a bad film on dvd, doesn't make it any better.<br />Just be greatful you aren't trapped in a darkened theater with it.  If you wanna see Halle Berry and Hugh Jackman in various states of undress..and who doesn't?  It's worth renting.<br />But it's a big mean loud vulgar and abruptly violent film. Hardy a redeeming value, when there is better ultra violence to be found just about anywhere else.<br />Go buy HARDBOILED it's loud and violent without the meaness.
B00005JKQX|5.0|Definitely the best film I have seen in the past year. It will change you.<br />This is the true story of a brilliant mathematician, Dr. John Nash, who distinguished himself before he was 30 as an incredible mathematical theorist who disproves a postulate that has been followed and taught for over 150 years when Nash comes along.<br />Math in itself may not intrigue you, but the movie will. The story is delivered in a way that the most inept in mathematics can follow.<br />After receiving his PhD, he becomes a professor and he works at MIT Wheeler Labs, helping the U.S. government with code problems during the Cold War.<br />Everyone knows him to be a bit odd and eccentric and no one, not even himself, realizes he has been battling schizophrenia for years.<br />I suspect that Paul Bettany may receive a nomination for best supporting actor as the college roommate that helps to socialize Nash (Russell Crowe) and pull him out of his reclusive shell so that he could meet the love of his life, Alicia, magnificently portrayed by Jennifer Connelley.<br />Jennifer Connelley has proved herself over and over again in previous films... hopefully this year the Academy will remember her and give her the nomination she deserves. She is fantastic in this movie.<br />Needless to say, Crowe's performance is definitely deserving of a Best Actor nomination.  The acting in this film is so real, you forget you're watching a movie. The movie takes the viewer on an exciting ride that will have moments of humor and heartbreak. There are many times throughout the film that you can not tell if you are seeing a hallucination or the real thing and you will be put in the shoes of John Nash for a brief time... is it real, or is it in your head?<br />The film's score is also worthy of recognition.<br />&quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; is a beautiful film. The characters are real and moving and the experience of seeing the film may change the way you perceive those with mental illness... and it will definitely stir the heart of anyone who does not have a heart made of cement. Fabulous. This is another one that will go into my DVD collection when it becomes available.efinitely stir the heart of anyone who does not have a heart made of cement. Fabulous.

B00005O5CM|3.0|Fish out of water gag wearing trendy clothes.<br />She's pert &amp; perky and platinum to boot. Reese does her job well and is very beguiling. However there is nothing original to see here. Not a bad way to waste 2 hours if there is nothing on TV.
0792162803|4.0|Saturday Night Live star Molly Shannon brings her character Mary Katherine Gallagher to this comedy blast. Mary Kaherine Gallagher just wants a romantic Hollywood kiss. Mary Katherine decides that the only way to be kissed is to become one of those people getting little kisses around campus a lot. When Catholic Teen Magazine holds a talent show at her school, Mary must prove that she has many talents that others have overlooked and she just might fulfill her dreams of becoming a Superstar! Will Ferrel also co-stars as the school popular hunk that all the women faint over and adore. This movie is great for any fan of Mary Katherine Gallagher on SNL or any person looking for a fun-filled riotous comedy.
B00003CY5J|4.0|Three of the best actors ever, wasted puttering around inside a caper film. Angela Basset should be awfully insulted by having been cast the role of 'the girl.' Brando does give a nice Sidney Greenstreet performance.  Worth seeing but one should have to buy it.
B00001OH7P|5.0|Seriously, this is one of the most essential rock albums ever recorded... If your into punk, classic rock, art rock or what ever, this album is one that will grace your turn table or CD player over and over again.  This is Bowie at one of his greatest points and you can see why he inspired so many artists of today and yester-year.  I greatly recomend this album to whoever like pure Rock 'N Roll and to those who just enjoy great song writing.  The lyrics and music are both beautiful and neither cancel each other out.  This album is a good starter for those who wish to get into Bowie a bit more and a no-brainer for those who enjoy the artist's other albums.  Not a single song on this piece are weak, all being pure classics
B00003CXZ1|3.0|There isn't a whole lot to choose from in the women kicking butt category. This would have been a great film if it was edited better. Granted the plot is convoluted and hard to follow, but she looks great. Too bad you can't see her half the time. They spend so much on the special effects you have to cut em faster than the eye can see to get all the money onto the screen. When the sequel comes I hope they slow it down.
B000003TA4|5.0|The life of Kurt Cobain and his pain and strife comes out in his music.This CD is one of my favorite CD's still today,after eleven years after it has been released.The legends live on in their music.....
B00005RFAI|5.0|I am a MASSIVE R&amp;B fan and this Cd, although isn't the genre I love is a great collection of hard-hitting tunes. A lot of people writing reviews of this seem to say \\"If you either like RnB music or loved her first album, then this CD is NOT 4 u\\", this isn't a true statement. I can play this Cd hundreds of time and only skip one song. Here my list that is very faithful to the songs (some people will write anything to get on the net!)<BR> <BR>1. MISSUNDAZTOOD- **** the first of 3 RnB songs on the album. Lyrics are good and catchy, but the last 90 seconds of this song get on your nerves after she say &quot;Uh&quot; about a thousand times! <BR>2. DON'T LET ME GET Me- **** the first rock/pop song on the album. Hilarious lyrics, very true to life and a brilliant reference to Ms Spears. <br />3. JUST LIKE A PILL- *****- This song will get to number 1 if released just for the chorus!, the metaphor of a pill as a man is great and works really well, this song will constantly be in your head! <br />4. GET THIS PARTY STARTED-*****- The second RnB single with a 70s techno sound, currently riding the Billboard charts, a great dance song which encouraged alot of people to get this album. <br />5. RESPECT ****- Last RnB song, that has P!NK doing her very own &quot;rap&quot;, with hilarious consequences. Calling boys &quot;horny&quot; and saying &quot;mirror mirror on the wall, Damn i sure look fine&quot;. Another great chorus and a brilliant intro <br />NOW WERE GETTING TO THE STUFF RNB FANS WILL BE SHOCKED WITH................. BUT WILL IMMEDIATELY FALL IN LOVE WITH!!!<BR> <BR>6. 18 WHEELER-***** - Second best song on the album that has a great chorus that is truly addictive, all about not getting down when ur getting dumped by someone. Has both the girls and boys side of the story. <br />7. FAMILY PORTRAIT- ****- First &quot;ballad&quot; that is brilliant , in my opinion this is a RnB ballad as it has some heavy tunes that end with a brilliant chorus from some children that state &quot;In our Family Portrait we look pretty normal, lets get back to that&quot; <br />8. MISERY- *****- Featuring Steve Tyler, this is another brilliant tune which will get u thinking, kind of mid tempo but isn't heavy rock. <br />9. DEAR DAIRY- ****- Another mid tempo song that has a twinge of R&amp;B in it. A talk about her \\"secrets\\", very interesting and the chrous is catchy. <br />10. EVENTUALLY***- Brilliant song but gets boring after a while. A true ballad however that u can chill to. <br />11. LONELY GIRL-*****-Brilliant!!!! This has to be the HIGHLIGHT of the album, stick this on repeat all you R&amp;B fans you are in for a treat!, Linda's lyrics are so raw. <br />12. NUMB- ****- Heavy tune with some very rockish lyrics but repeats the word numb about a 100 times!, Good song to wake up to on a Saturday morning. <br />13. GONE TO CALIFORNIA- ** This song I have to skip because it is so boring and depressing but there's always one, now album is ever perfect, don't let this bring you down though, you may like it, this is just my opinion <br />14. MY VIETNAM-****- Brilliant song but takes a few listens with great lyrics similar to #2. (DON'T be put off by the title) <br />Enhanced CD includes extra track CATCH 22 ***- not the best but a hilarious bunch of lyrics! <br />Overall if u: <BR>1. Loved her 1st album then get this anyway<BR>2. Love RnB music get this<BR>3. Want a temporary new sound in your CD collection <br />Hope my review helps<BR> <br />Jason xxx
B00000K31Q|5.0|You just HAVE to see this movie! It's one of the best I have ever seen in my life! Julia Stiles made the person that she played beleiveable! It's cool that it's the same plot as the Shakespeare The Taming of the Shrew. I saw 10 Things I Hate About You over and over! It's THE BEST MOVIE!!!!!!
B00004WGYA|5.0|Since there was some discussion in earlier reviews about the different versions of Rio, I'll explain that first.<BR>When Duran Duran's Rio was released in the US in 1982, more than half of the album was remixed for a special US version. This was the only version that was ever released on vinyl or cassette in the states. When the album made its premiere on CD, the label went with the UK/worldwide master, leaving US fans wondering for years what had happened. The US only album version has never been released on CD. This is the UK/worldwide version of the album. This may not be Duran's best album, but it is the best representation of the style that brought them success. An essential album that belongs on the shelf of anyone who likes/collects/studies alternative/new wave/modern rock music. A masterpiece!!! The only way to improve it? Put the US mixes (which, aside from Hungry Like The Wolf, are actually different than the Night Versions) as bonus tracks.
014028009X|4.0|I was slightly apprehensive about reading Bridget Jones's Diary at first. I'd heard numerous good things about it, but feared that Bridget's man, weight, and self-esteem problems would make her a terminal whiner. To my surprise and delight, I found this book laugh-out-loud funny and much more clever than anticipated. <br />Bridget is a 30-something, single career-woman, dealing with the ups and downs of dating, a career, and life in general. She's constantly nagged about her relationship status by her eccentric mother and numerous family friends. You can imagine that she's tickled pink to finally be woo'ed by her boss, the charming and rascally, Daniel. Well, needless to say, nothing goes completely smooth with Daniel...if it did, this book would be much shorter. The antics that Bridget finds herself in, along and with an entertaining group of friends, are nothing short of hilarious.<br />I was also surpised and impressed by several blatant references to Pride and Prejudice (there's a Mr. Darcy in this book). I was even more surprised to see many parallels between the two stories as I read along, so keep your eyes peeled for these amusing similarities.<br />This is a wonderful book that I will keep close at hand when I need a laugh.
B000003TAR|5.0|This is a powerful album.  Nirvana was the greatest band ever, and this is their peak.  Its raw, cynical, angry, and depressing.  Everything I like.<br />Highlights:<BR>&quot;Heart Shaped Box&quot;  &quot;Rape Me&quot;  &quot;Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle&quot;  &quot;Very Ape&quot;  &quot;Milk It&quot;   &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot;  &quot;Radio Friendly Unit Shifter&quot; and &quot;ALL APOLOGIES&quot;<br />Well thats basically all the songs on IN UTERO.  rock on.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Obviously, there is little I can add about what a great move Citizen Kane is.  The DVD has a great picture and comes with two specal features:  commentaries by Roger Ebert and Peter Bogdanovich.  Both are insightful and reveal all sorts of things I never knew about the film.  There is also a documentary on the making of the film.

B000021Y7X|5.0|I own and have seen quite a few Musical DVD's and this is my favorite. I would go see this at a theatre!! Even if you don't really like Talking Heads you must have respect for the how excellent this dvd truly is. David Byrne is a genius and his creativity is only amplified by director Jonathan Demme. <BR>    It starts out with Byrne walking out with a guitar and boom box in a dirty warehouse which looks it is getting remodeled. The brillance? You can only see below his knees until a verse in, Its amazing how he taps his feet and bends his knees to the music wants to get you moving. When a new song starts a new band member comes out too till they are all there and do a stunning rendition of &quot;Burning down the house&quot;. Simply Amazing! Setting amplifies the mood with excellent lighting which causes the band members shadows to become giants on the board lining the back wall! Pictures show in the background on approiate songs and David Byrne voice is simply amazing as he changes his voice from a great higher pop sound to a low dark song one after the other. This is the standard by which all concert Movies should try and measure up too. The only musical talent that even comes close to Byrne is Ben Folds, Who also has a DVD with his previous band Ben Folds Five, Which by the way is a very good DVD just not nearly as artistic as This (but nothing is). David Byrne's Solo albums have been great everytime and I still think he is the most talented,original,creative person alive on this earth today. No questions about it. Here is to Talking Heads and all the joy they have brought me over my life. I have been watching them with thier video Story telling giant since I was 2. I should also mention im 15 years old and that even if there music isnt the same as most today, The sheer talent shines through and reaches me like no other. Don't delay buy this DVD today.

0140143505|5.0|I woke up early on Saturday January 13th. 2002, just in time to miss the first twenty minutes of 84 Charing Cross Road, on A&amp;E T.V. in Calgary Alberta. I do not usually watch a movie at 5 A.M., but I just checked for the weather and then I flicked a few channels, and happened upon the movie &quot; 84 Charing Cross Road&quot;. <br />I am a writer, and the first scene that I saw was the one of Ann Bancroft at the typewriter writing a letter to Mark &amp; Co., Booksellers. This kept me on the hook for the rest of the movie. <br />Usually, in the past, I have turned off movies that have the English look to them, but not this time. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I could not find record of another presentation on television, so, I surfed the Internet for the book.  I paid my money and I am now waiting for the arrival of the hard copy.<br />I thought that the story was so down to earth that it brought the past into view for me. I saw people who cared for people in sincere fashion.  I saw people who formed a relationship of love: Long Distance. People who never saw each other, loved as though they met on some focused romantic adventure. A physical connection existed as though it were a match made in heaven.<br />I liked the part where a friend of Helene Hanff's went to London to explore the Marks &amp; Co., Booksellers store to give Helene a mind picture she could relate to. She saw Frank's office and all the neat things about the antiquated shop. <br />On another occasion, Helene's friend stopped in and left some nylons on a desk in MARKS &amp; CO. They were for Frank's family. This left the people in the bookstore in a quandary. They could not figure out how this happened. This gesture was just another one of those expressions of love that this book is about.<br />Frank observed another visit by Helene's friend; he watched her as if thinking that if may be Helene herself. The anticipation seen in his demeanor was worth the thousand words a picture is supposed to represent. I thought that he was going to go over and introduce himself, and give her an English hug.<br />The bookstore family of MARKS &amp; CO., Booksellers was unable to secure some of the luxuries of life in the fifties. I loved it when Helene and her friends in New York sent these items through a parcel by post system. There was so much true love portrayed in this movie, which I expect the book will revisit for me when it arrives by post. <br />Helene had a dream to one day cross over to England and visit the people she had such a great relationship with. She never got there as long as the book sore was still alive. Frank, her key connection in the whole story also died as did some of the others. She never met Frank. It was as if fate kept them apart.   If she had met him, the story might have taken on a sordid twist. <br />There seemed to be such a relationship of love that had developed through their correspondence by letter, that if they had met, it might have destroyed the good marriage relationship that Frank had with his wife. Frank's wife realized that there was something of a love affair, which had developed because of simple requests for books by letter. The love of books both Frank and Helene shared was so strong that it bonded them together for life. <br />I was nearly moved to tears when news of Franks death was brought to Helene. She was as broken up as one is when they lose the closet thing on earth. It was as if she lost a piece of herself, when Frank died. <br />Circumstance had kept Helene from visiting earlier in the twenty year relationship, but she finally put everything aside and went to see Marks &amp; Co., Booksellers, on 84 Charing Cross Road, London England for herself. It was empty now, but she saw Frank's office, and she smiled. This was another picture worth a thousand words. <br />Well, there is much more. You will have to get the book, and see:  \\" The Rest of  The Story\\". <br />Wonderful Story!
B00004Z459|5.0|Before hearing Hybrid Theory, I never thought I liked hard rock. But now it is my favorite kind of music. I like many artists like Rage Against The Machine and Van Halen, but Linkin Park is by far the best of them all. The song &quot;In The End&quot; is great and impossible to get tired of. A Cure For The Itch is entirely instrumental, but is still a great song. If you subscribe to BMG Music Service or just need to start your CD collection, then make this your first choice!

0345409671|4.0|This is not a bad book, but it isn't a good one either.  At times it becomes boring, but the path of logic that Anne carries out is very scary and that's what kept me reading the book. It's not as easy to read as other of the her books and there are better books by Anne Rice.
B00005OM4N|3.0|Listening to this album seems like a game of 'spot the producer'. Rather than go with her old recipe of making every song sound similar, each song on this album has an original sound. Unfortunately, they all sound like the sort of 'original' songs you hear at McDonald's or KFC.. namely, cheap R&amp;B.<br />The easiest way for me to review this album is to say that it starts off excellently, and goes down from there. Her awful cover of an even worse song 'I Love Rock &amp; Roll' is just a small blip half way down the slippery slope to Eurovision-Song-Contest style 'Before The Goodbye'.<br />Best songs are tracks 1 through 6. But the amazing thing is how so many of these songs sound like they were written for other performers.. 'Anticipating' sounds like a Janet Jackson song. 'Let Me Be' is Destiny's Child. 'That's Where You Take Me' is Jordan Knight. And 'When I Found You' sounds like it was lifted from Garbage's 'Beautifulgarbage'.<br />So, this is a pretty nice album to listen to once in a while, but it's not going to be sitting in the CD player for long. Enjoy the great tracks, avoid the dull generic ones, and this album is just about worth the purchase price.
B00005B4GU|3.0|Radiohead has done it again - put out an album that's about as cold and emotionless as any music I've heard.  Sure, it's a bit more structured than KID A, but it sounds as if Thom Yorke has had it with the world today, and seems content to lose himself in the latest musical technology the world has to offer.  Maybe that's his take on what the world has become.<br />Sure, we're more removed from daily life like never before.  As a society we sit inside our hermetically sealed homes in front of a TV or a computer screen, seemingly determined to avoid any kind of human contact whatsoever.  We order out food and barely look at the delivery guy when he shows up.  Or we use grocery delivery service.  We do our shopping online.  We have caller ID.  We stare at our TV and watch increasingly hysterical news reports of rising violence in the world.  And when it all gets too much, maybe we'll take drugs or drink ourselves into oblivion.  Anything to avoid human interaction or feel too much.<br />This album captures that feeling of isolation through technology.  I can see where Yorke and his band are coming from, but it's not the world I want to live in.  I don't want to give in to that.  I'd rather hear music that makes me feel something, that uplifts, enrages, or makes me wallow in sadness.  I'd rather feel alive than robotic.<br />I'll give Radiohead this.  Their last two albums accurately reflect the rapidly numbed feelings of the digital-age world we live in.  Disembodied voices, ghostly computer sounds, music that sounds as if it was churned out of a giant unblinking machine instead of by living breathing people. It makes me feel nothing, and I fear for the direction this music is heading.<br />Maybe I should give AMNESIAC more stars if it sparks this type of reaction in me.  But I'm not sure this is as much a &quot;rebirth of rock&quot; as it is one man's chronicle of just giving in and giving up.  And I can't enjoy music like that.
B00003CXAA|5.0|I agree with other reviewers that this is a great DVD set.  Over the last 30 years, I have watch the videos at least once a year.  So it was with great anticipation for me when Godfather III was released.  <br />It was a dissapointment for me for reasons other than Coppola's comments.  First, I think the casting of his daughter was just fine.  Some persons in the industry who may have had it in for Coppola obviously hurt him personally, but I think he should have ignored it.  It was a low blow and who can fault his casting anyway. Sophia, you were ideal.<br />I haven't seen this observation anywhere, but I was struck how all three films were cast in shades of brown, even Kay's bronze satin suit in GIII matched the mahogony panneling.  I think the intent was to lend a sepia cast like an old photo.  It was striking and inovative.<br />The big problem I had with GIII was the change in Michael's character.  After all the personally cruel things he did, he finally got religeon.  Not believable to me.<br />The most unbeleivable item for me was the last scene.  How in heaven's name did they take this ivy league college boy and alter him into an ethnic stereotype.  I hated his haircut.  Older men with this hair style wear their hair this way because it was the style in the 1950s and they never changed.  This was not Michael.  To top it all off, he is wearing that silly hat which would have been worn by a fruit peddler in 1900.<br />The story line didn't run true and I think they should have stopped with GII if they couldn't come up with a better story.
B000000OTU|5.0|Aerosmith has done it again! What a fantastic CD. All of your favorite songs packed into one CD. Dude Looks Like A Lady, and Janie's Got A Gun to name a few. I received it as a gift and I listen to it every day. Great Gift, and a Excellent CD.
B000002ADT|5.0|What can you say about this album... it's considered one of the best jazz albums ever... This was my first jazz album, and I've owned it for several months... I like it... it's very nice and relaxing... check out track 3, the title of this review applies here... this is nice for sitting down and relaxing after a long day... I'm listening to it now, and it is late at night, and the music is really striking a cord with me... I have always liked it, but never loved it... After buying a listening to other classic jazz albums since buying this one, I decided to give this one another listen tonight, and I'm loving it... great great music... This is the kind of jazz I like... it's swing jazz, it's slower more laid back jazz... not fast and crazy like A Love Supreme... On A Love Supreme I find the solos are too fast for me to get anything from them... but with this one, the solos are slower, are never rushed... this is a great place to start if you don't own any jazz, and get ready for some great music...<br />also check out Time Out by the Dave Brubeck Quartet... very very good...
B000001FDQ|5.0|As someome who has studied every note on this album for 15 years allow me to say what makes Yngwie's playing so amazing is the fluidity, the naturalness, the way the notes emanated from his fingers as if conducted by a Viking diety on high, with Yngwie as his conduit. Dare I say genuis: on par with other humans that are simply the 'best' (possibly in the world) at something. Near perfection yet human all the same.<br />As others have mentioned, there are guitarists today faster, tighter and cleaner than Yngwie at his peak, but something in his vibrato,his supreme confidence with his instrument, the licks that flowed endlessly, each one having Yngwie's signature on them, this is what made Yngwie great.
B00005MP58|5.0|I've owned the two tape VHS set of this finely made BBC miniseries for several years and had practically worn it out with repeated viewings. I held off converting to the DVD version mainly due to the high cost, and am I ever glad that I did! This newly released 2 disc set is a vast improvement over the previous one if for no other reason than it is letterboxed in 1:85/1 format which really brings the story and characters into much sharper focus. One of the features I love best about DVD is the ability to review old favorite films with a clarity of image and sound which makes the entire experiance new and rewarding, and this beautiful version of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is a great example. Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth seem born to assay thier roles, leading a sterling cast of great British character actors in a spirited romp through the magnificent English countryside. Like Emma Thompson's award winning adaption of SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, this film really breathes life into Jane Austin's tale. It was well worth waiting to see it in this DVD transfer.
B00005LC1H|5.0|While installing cable for Cox Communications in Orange County California I met many interesting people. At one house I installed for this British couple who could not say enough good things about this show. Once they started talking about Fawlty Towers they could not stop smiling. It was the first time I had ever heard of the show and ever since I could not wait to see them all. So for what this is worth. Buy It!
B00005KHJR|5.0|There has been a great deal of go-round about the video and DVD versions of this film, all of which is amply and somewhat wistfully explained in the very well produced featurette which is included on the disc. This is still an incredible film, very much a product of it's time yet able to provoke strong emotions in an audience 30 years after it was made. For the record: The &quot;Theatrical Version&quot; disc is minus the entire opening segment and the sequence which introduces Christopher Lee's character early in the film (and contains one of his best lines as he watches two snails copulate). Britt Ekland's famous nude dance is intact, but moved forward in the editing which creates a continuity error in the films narrative. The short &quot;morning after&quot; scene between Ekland and Edward Woodward which follows the nude dance is only in this version and not the expanded one. The &quot;Expanded Version&quot; returns all the sequences to their proper places and is a much more coherent and understandable print. Even though the &quot;missing footage&quot; was culled from other sources, I found very little drop in image or sound quality on the DVD and frankly it is so wonderful to finally be able to see clearly a film I have loved for decades that I really didn't care. Unfortunately the Expanded Version is only available as part of the boxed set which is a bit pricey for most, but this film is well worth having and I was completely satisfied with the transfer to DVD.
B00005RFVL|5.0|at first, i thought it's a totally new album, but looking at the list, some of the songs r rather familiar, well, may be he's doing a cover, then i knew that i was wrong as this album may not be a \\"robbie\\" album but it's sure is his best effort yet! different from his previous performing style, this album possess a smooth side of him in delivering oldies in the soft and gentle ways, \\"i will talk and hollywood will listen\\" is killing me as it's the first track of this album, so, hollywood, better listen to what robbie will say to u! if u'r a \\"rock-robbie-fan\\", u might not like this but as for a music lover, u will be amazed!<BR>\\"somethin' stipid\\", a duet with nicole kidman, it's the song that was arranged so nicely and plus the string of guitar, that make makes this song a sound smoother and u will swing when u'r listening!\\"mack the knife\\" n \\"mr. bojangles\\" r some of the fav of my list!<BR>the selection of the songs in this album might not be those well known but it's something really freshened up the industry, so, if u'r the old generation, u just gotta get this, if u'r the young generation, don't miss this, if u don't like it, then give it to ur grand parents, sure they will luv u more than ever!!
B00005UW85|1.0|Please read reviews for the other Good Times releases of MCLINTOCK and don't be fooled into buying this set either. Only the Authorized cut of this film put out by the John Wayne Foundation is the theatrical release print! The Good Times version is a full 45 minutes shorter and contains a completely different music score. This DVD is pan&amp;scan as well, not the full Panavision widescreen image. Hopefully the Wayne Foundation will soon release the full cut on DVD, but until then the authorized VHS version is the only acceptable video available.
B00005A46T|1.0|Slayer is better, the Haunted is much better, Slipknot thinks they are heavy but Iowa is not as good as the first one, I returned my copy and exchanged it for Opeth. It's good, but from what I've read I was expecting a real metal album, not this.
B000021YQV|5.0|System of a Down doesn't happen to be very talented, but they're very unique.  They combine metal, cult, indie, asian tunes, and acoustic backups to form their band.  If you like any of those kinds of music, you should try this out.  I myself am more of an alternative, punkrock person, but this does it for me.  Pretty much clean, except for drug abuse (Psycho) and refrences to sex (Bounce.)  This may not be your cup of tea, but if you're a rocker, you should try this one out.
B000002GB9|5.0|This is it, the greatest Styx cd, and one of the best cds in rock history. Not a bad or weak song on this disk. And it shows Styx at its best, as a group, and this is a group effort, from the opening title track, to the last.<BR> The first track, The Grand Illusion, is a heavy metal anthem on the illusions of life, for the rich or poor, the common man or the superstar. Come Sail Away, is the best track, about looking back on life, about your dreams. As it slowly builds from its piano opening, to its rocking ending, this song as you singing along with. Dennis also has two other songs on this disk, the mystical, and haunting Castle Walls (love the keyboard work in the middle of the song), and the Grand Finale.<BR> Tommy, also has some his best work, Man in the Wilderness, has a great guitar solo in the middle, and Fooling Yourself, with acoustic guitar and keyboards, makes for an interesting song. Superstar, is the only song that really doesn't hold up to rest, but it's still good.<BR> JY's one song, the rocking Miss America, is his best work, and the song that he is best know for. If all of this songs were like this , he would only need one song an outing.<BR> Blazing guitars, a sea of keyboards, and a wall of harmonies, all hidden behind lyics about life, this makes for a awesome concept album. The songs, all fantatic, listened to by their selves, or on the radio, cannot do the album the justice, of sitting down and cranking it up, from start to finish. GRADE A+
B00005QG9J|1.0|I remember a day, not long ago when Incubus was my favorite band. They had the most insightful thought-provoking lyrics I had ever heard from &quot;New Skin&quot; to &quot;Vitamin&quot; and &quot;Favorite Things&quot;, Incubus was the most sincere group of the time.<BR>Those days are now few and far between, due to this 'new' Incubus that has suddenly played the pretty boys of MTV doing the little Diary of Incubus TV show thing and toning down their anti-religious, free thought scream into a wimper. I saw it coming when DJ Lyfe was fired or left the band (whichever the case), and Brandon cut his dreds (wouldn't be suprised if he did it soley to become more acc accessible to the mainstream).<br />The music on Make Yourself was less original, and the lyrics from S.C.I.E.N.C.E were toned down. The music was also focused on being more 'mainstream rock' as opposed to the work done on earlier releases. Then I found out that Kilmore took over on the DJ position and the music was less influential BUT Make Yourself was still a pretty good cd. <BR>Then this thing came out. What happened? Brandon Boyd has a great voice, you wouldn't think that after listening to &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; in which it sounds like a whine. And the lyrics? &quot;I dig my toes into the sand, the ocean looks like a 1,000 diamonds strewn across the plain&quot; YaK! They are SO corny, what happened to &quot;The things that make us human are my favorite things&quot;? Insightful lyrics about the question of reality and the state of our minds, now this cheesy-refined-steamlined-for-the-TRL-crowd-ick. It saddens me that even their attempts to regain that very emotion feels watered down.<BR>Don't rate this cd based on WHO they are (wheather they're intelligent or not, because I KNOW they are), but what they're doing, musically. It's bad, don't be fooled by their previous work, this is horrible. If you're gonna buy an Incubus cd get S.C.I.E.N.C.E., it is worth EVERY PENNY! It was full of heart and packed with emotion, but now those days are long gone.
B000008GEF|5.0|With this release, George Harrison shows just why his songs were some the best in the Beatles catalog.The sound quality of this CD is great and has many great harrison hits.
B000005L86|5.0|Of the 350 reggae CD's I own, this is easily one of the top 5. It's real music from the heart - don't expect any ego-rapping or other pseudo reggae BS on this.

B00005Q4CS|3.0|***1/2 Anyone even remotely contemplating getting involved with drugs, either legal or illegal, would have second thoughts after seeing \\"Requiem For a Dream,\\" a cautionary tale brilliantly directed by Darren Aronofsky and starring the magnificent Ellen Burstyn in an Oscar-nominated performance.<br />In confronting the issue of drug addiction, Aronosky (who co-wrote the screenplay with Hubert Selby Jr.) has chosen to tell two stories that, although they run along basically parallel tracks for most of the film's duration, do occasionally intersect.  That point of intersection is the mother/son relationship between Sara Goldfarb, a lonely widow living in a rundown tenement in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, and her son, Harry, a ne'er do well loser hooked up with a couple of junkies, one of whom is his girlfriend, Marion.  Harry and his friends are well on their way to becoming addicts when the movie opens and, until the supply suddenly peters out, the three of them are having the time of their lives.  Unfortunately, once they hit hard times, all hell breaks loose and their lives quickly become a downward spiral into withdrawal, crime, prostitution, illness and prison.  This is the more conventional side of the screenplay.  Where the film really charts new territory is in the concomitant half which is focused on Sara, a well meaning woman whose obsession to lose a few pounds results in her becoming addicted to doctor-prescribed amphetamines.  For Sara, this leads to an eventual descent into disorientation, hallucinatory episodes and, eventually, madness.<br />Some may find Aronosky's blunt directorial style to be overemphatic, hammer-like and off-putting.  To approximate the feeling of dislocation caused by the various drugs, the director employs a wide variety of cinematic techniques at his disposal: sped up motion, jarring quick cuts, visual distortion etc.  Though it can become a bit much at time, one has to admire the effort to bring the viewer as much into the minds of the characters as is conceivably possible using the resources of filmmaking.  The film is both unsparing and unflinching in showing the physical and psychological damage drugs can cause.  The last section of the film, though it could be accused of lacking subtlety, nevertheless becomes a harrowing journey into a world filled with confusion, despair and pain.<br />Burstyn makes Sara a compelling and sympathetic figure from the very start.  Alone in her drab room, she watches T.V. all day, dreaming of the time when she will matter to someone again.  Burstyn does a brilliant job in showing how, thanks to her increasing addiction, Sara slowly loses her grip on reality and slips over into schizophrenia and madness.  And though we are appalled by the anti-social behavior both of her son, Henry, and of his cronies, we come to see even them in three-dimensional terms, especially through Harry's obvious love of his mother and the tenderness that develops in Harry and Marian's relationship.  The revelatory moment occurs when Harry realizes that his mother is also addicted to drugs, yet how hollow his words sound as he admonishes her to kick her habit.  Even he can do little but break down in tears during the cab ride home and return to his own self-absorbed drug addicted life.  (This is the last time we ever see them together as their lives diverge to follow their own paths towards mutual self-destruction).<br />Special note should be taken of Clint Mansell's subtle and haunting musical score, which brings an air of melancholy uneasiness to this strange world of the drug-addicted mind.<br />Brilliantly acted and superbly directed, \\"Requiem For a Dream,\\" though not always easy to watch, reveals uncompromising truths that cannot be ignored.the characters as is conceivably possible using the resources of filmmaking.

0060001941|5.0|This book has so many pearls of wisdom.  It's very simply written, so do not expect this to be a typical NYT bestseller like the one you read last week.  I believe this book was written in the '40s, and although much of the vernacular in the book is obviously of a different period in time, it has a timeless and universal appeal.  I haven't even finished it yet, but have already decided, enough with the library version, I want my own copy so that I can use the advice it offers later on in life.  Don't miss this one, and make sure you tell your friends about it, so that they can come and thank you later, and you can say &quot;I told you so&quot;.
6301016866|1.0|I purchased this item for my friend who speaks fluent Spanish.  The description read &quot;dubbed in Spanish&quot;.  After speaking to my friend after Christmas, he told me that the movie was in English, with Spanish subtitles.  I was embarrased, but he obviously didn't want to hurt my feelings, so he just said it was OK.  I just let it go but I think the description should be changed.  It just was so embarrassing for me.
B000021Y77|5.0|This is the second film by the director. His first film although interesting was rather static. This film is full of energy and never stops for a minute.<br />The basis of the plot is fairly simple. The heroine's boyfriend has lost a large amount of money belonging to gangsters. Lola has a very short time to get the money or her boyfriend will be killed in an unpleasant way. She has to run from her flat and work out some scheme to raise the cash.<br />The film intertwines a series of different plots and endings which could have arisen from that one scenario. Each is in its own way amusing although some are grim.<br />As Lola desperately searches for ways to raise the cash there is a grinding techno beat soundtrack which pulsates with energy. Lola herself is played by an actress with total charisma and screen prescence. The only slight negative to the film is that one wonders how she could end up with such a jerk. The film also uses animated sequences and still photography and is quite inovative in style.<br />Not only do Lola and her boyfriend face different fates in each scenario but so do the bit players that they meet. One of the more interesting and dynamic films in years.
B000002LSV|4.0|I understand that a lot of the long time ZZ Top fans feel that this collection missed a lot of the classic, older tracks.  I feel the same way when I listen to something like Def Leppard's best of collection, as I feel that there is not enough focus on the early, hardest rocking stuff.  But from my perspective (i.e. growing up listening to '80s music), this ZZ Top collection is just about right, as it has just about all of the songs by this band that I grew up listening to.  <br />My one real complaint about this collection is the remastering/remixing of such classics as &quot;La Grange&quot; and &quot;Legs&quot;.  Why do the artists and/or record companies believe that we would want anything different from the original versions on a greatest hits collection?  I also would like to see the song &quot;Stages&quot; from the &quot;Afterburner&quot; album--as it was a mid-'80s radio favorite of mine.  Overall, though, this collection rocks.  From the crunching riffs of &quot;Give Me All Your Lovin'&quot; and &quot;Got Me Under Pressure&quot; to the classic '70s rock of &quot;Tush&quot; and &quot;I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide&quot; to the more recent but still enjoyable &quot;Doubleback&quot; (from &quot;Back To The Future II&quot; sound track originally), this album gives a great taste of this classic blues-based rock band.  Also enjoyable is the raunch of &quot;Pearl Necklace&quot; and &quot;Tube Snake Boogie&quot; as well as the rare slow ZZ Top track &quot;Rough Boy&quot;--also a mid-'80s favorite.<br />In summary, this is a fine collection to get an overall taste of what this band was about in their prime.  Definitely a recommended purchase for any '80s fans of the band and '70s fans of the band who still enjoyed them when they became popular later on.
076790382X|4.0|After Bill Bryson returned to America he wrote a column for an English newspaper about his experiances. These columns have been collected togeher to make up this book. Thus the book is not one of his travel books as such.<br />The articles are written for an English market and most of them make gentle jokes about America and how different it is from England. There are discussions about shoping malls, drug policy and a range of other things. <br />In general it is classic Bill Bryson with most of the articles being very funny and also most containing acute observations about the American culture. <br />Some Americans may not like the book as the articles sometimes are a little critical and are destined for reading behind the irony curtain.
B000002AE3|4.0|Toto's hits stopped at the end of the '80s, but the stellar musicianship and albums continued and in fact expanded in the '90s.  Like so many others, I lost track of this band for much of the '90s but got reaquainted with them through the Internet.  This was the first of the '90s albums I listened to.  Since then I have bought both their last album &quot;Mindfields&quot; and 1992's entirely overlooked &quot;Kingdom Of Desire&quot;, both of which I now like even better than this album.  Nonetheless, this album is the one that made me fall in love with Toto all over again.<br />&quot;Gift Of Faith&quot; is a gorgeous, over 7-minute anthem to lead off the anthem.  Melodic and somewhat guitar-driven, this song gets the album off on the right foot.  Next comes the sad and yet beautifully haunting ballad &quot;I Will Remember&quot;.  Steve Lukather, who does most of the lead vocals on this effort, shines here as he does on all Toto ballads.  The same can be said for later ballads on the album like &quot;The Other End Of Time&quot; and &quot;Just Can't Get To You&quot;, both of which are also very endearing songs.<br />While this album doesn't rock as much as its predecessor, the aforementioned &quot;Kingdom Of Desire&quot;, there are still some rocking tracks here as well.  Songs like &quot;Drag Him To The Roof&quot; and the instrumental &quot;Dave's Gone Skiing&quot; are examples of that.  There are also gorgeous mid-tempo tracks like &quot;Slipped Away&quot; and &quot;Time Is The Enemy&quot;; these songs, like many others here, can bring goosebumps with their layered, fantastic melodies.<br />&quot;Baby He's Your Man&quot;, while probably my least favorite track on this album, is worth a mention due to its different direction.  This is &quot;Toto does R&amp;B&quot;, with drum loops and female vocals rounding out a very unusual sound for Toto.  Not bad, I guess, once you get used to it.  One more track to mention, &quot;The Road Goes On&quot;--the last track on the albumbesides an unlisted one--is another gorgeous anthem/ballad with fantastic lyrics....&quot;Now I see it all through different eyes; where I'm going, where I've gone.  All I know - I'm still surprised that the road goes on and on.&quot;  Enough said.  For sure, I hope the road continues on for Toto, one of my favorite bands of all time.
B000002UA2|4.0|Iam a fifteen year old Pink Floyd fan with a vast knowledge of the band for my age. Im very keen on all classic rock, basically because most of today's stuff is just not good enough. I'm guessing you've probably heard THE WALL, OR DSOTM, This album is very different in its construction compared to these landmark albums, but it shows the growing songwriting talents of Gilmour, Wright and Waters. Overall a neseccesity for all Floyd fans, but it might sound a little different compared with later albums.
B000000OPZ|5.0|This album was among &quot;the best of the best&quot; of all the great hard rock albums that came out in 1987.  The combination of classic and melodic hard rock make this an all time mainstream rock masterpiece.<br />&quot;Still Of The Night&quot; is, beyond a doubt, one of the best hard rocking tracks of all time.  Clocking in at just over 6:30, this song just doesn't let up!  Begins and ends heavy with a slight slowdown in the middle for dramatic effect.  Obviously the two huge radio hits &quot;Here I Go Again&quot; and &quot;Is This Love&quot; are fantastic--the epitome of a time when pop radio was listenable.  &quot;Give Me All Your Love&quot; is an underrated track--I particularly love the exploding drums at the end of the track.  &quot;Cryin' In The Rain&quot; and &quot;Children Of The Night&quot; both are great heavy rockers, and &quot;Don't Turn Away&quot; is an excellent anthem to end the album.<br />Quite simply, there is not a bad track here.  Nearly 15 years after its release, this album is just as rocking and enjoyable to me today as it was when it came out.  Absolutely an essential purchase for fans of '80s melodic hard rock.
6303908306|5.0|This movie was suggested to me by a friend of mine, and so I rented it. I had no idea what I was getting into. This movie has all around the best acting, directing, writing, cinmetography, and sound editing I think I've ever seen in a film (and I've seen tons of films.) This is a movie you will want to buy so you can watch it repeated times. But I warn you, you will never completely figure it out. Kevin Spacey and everyone else in the movie is awesome. This is deffinately one of the best films ever!
6302402824|5.0|This is one fine collection of slick and savy vids. Great sound and picture quality but where the hell is the DVD version. This collection has been available on DVD in Europe and elsewhere for years but the US and Canadian versions have yet to see the light of day. C'mon guys give us the goods. Perhaps an expanded US version is in the works including bonus vids like &quot;She's Just Killing Me&quot;, &quot;Doubleback&quot;, &quot;Pincushion&quot; and &quot;Breakaway&quot;. One can only hope. This collection is recommended!!
B00000DQSZ|5.0|This is the most haunting music I've ever heard. I only knew Kraftwerk by name, then I read some reviews and decided to start with TEE. Today, unlike at the time it was released, their music sounds tremendously trivial, and that's its beauty. I just can't stop listening, for it is so CATCHING. The beat is so hypnotizing that you unconsciously shake your body following it. Indeed it's repetitive, but so what? Sounds very very pleasant. The highlights are the beautiful Europe Endless, the hit Showroom Dummies and the heavy TEE/Metal on Metal.
B000001FMX|5.0|This album is the place to begin.  I first heard it some twenty-five years ago and said.... when do the solos end, meaning, When does Johnny finish? Do his solos ever GET TO THE POINT? Or beyond one note? Little did I know that that his style would influence me beyond any other.His solos would become a joy--what Kris Needs called his cliff-hanging terror. His simple perfection.This is seminal stuff. As influencial (among those who matter) as any record of the last 25 years, this sings, in fact, it sneers. Jerry Nolan shows what the backbeat is about---holding his loaded, image-obsessed, YOUNG comrades together.This IS rock and roll. Buy it to know that Brittany didn't invent it. (Blech.)

B00000K19E|5.0|I didn't see the Matrix in a theater, and I'm dissapointed that I didn't. My friends said it was an excellent movie. I'm in high school, and they thought it was great. I rented it when it came out on video, and the first time I saw it, I wasn't sure I even liked it. The whole idea was new to me. I watched it again and was blown away. The \\"dream world\\" was done so well with the bullet time and even though the plot was good, the dialogue had a chance to become cliche and obvious, but it didn't. I can't say much here to tell someone about the movie, they have to go and see it to get what I mean. [...]
0345440757|3.0|While I do believe babies need a routine, I think it's unrealistic and unfair to baby to be on a flexible routine from birth.  In my opinion, a good time to encourage your baby to fall on a routine is around 2 months of age when baby and you are settled in.  I think she does a good job of explaining on how to read your baby's cues.  One of her programs E.A.S.Y. is about getting your baby on a structured routine from day one. (E-Eating, A-Activity, S-Sleep, Y-You)  I do agree with her on how a baby needs to sleep in his/her own bed.  She also mentions that a mom is and should have some &quot;me&quot; time without feeling quilty.  <br />In the book, there are tips throughout the book.  Her other program which discusses your baby's cues is S.L.O.W. (S-Stop, L-Listen, O-Oberve, and W-What's Up)  There is also a chart included which explains a baby's language and facial expression,  <br />In the book, the author also discusses in detail on breastfeeding and bottlefeeding, a section on childproofing and wheather or not to use a pacifier.
B00005JKQX|4.0|If you want to be entertained, moved, and possibly inspired, &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; may do the trick - it is well-crafted, with superb, understated acting from its stars despite occasionally schmaltzy moments in the script. But if you want to learn about Nash the Nobel-winning mathematician, read the biography of the same title by Sylvia Nasar. <br />I really enjoyed this movie in the theatre. Unfortunately, when I read Nash's biography, I realized just how much had been sacrificed to create this tale of one man's triumph over madness. Nash's bisexuality, his earlier relationship and illegitimate son, his years of estrangement from Alicia, the combination of paranoid and megalomaniacal delusions that characterized the full-blown stages of his illness and the solid work he accomplished during treatment... all had been swept under the rug. Leaving them out made Crowe's Nash a simpler, more sympathetic hero, but in my opinion does a disservice to the equally humorous, tragic, and heroic story of the real Nash's life.
B00005QK3W|5.0|For those who are giving this record negative reviews, are we even listening to the same disc?<br />This is simply the best new album Paul has put out since Tug Of War!  This record is more guitar driven than the previous few efforts, but it's a pleasant surprise.  Paul rocks the house down with several songs.   Driving Rain is certainly more upbeat than his last effort, FLAMING PIE, and the music sounds optimistic &amp; inspired. The production sounds crisp &amp; modern, and he made an excellent choice by enlisting David Kahne as the producer.  Driving Rain shows an artist who still feels he has something left to prove to himself and his audience. Instead of creating laid back, elevator music like many of his contemporaries, Paul is still willing to take risks creatively. <br />Driving Rain has a bit of everything.  From superlative rockers like &quot;About You&quot; &amp; &quot;Rinse the Raindrops&quot; to sentimental songs like &quot;I DO&quot; to catchy, beatle-esque songs like &quot;Tiny Bubble&quot;, it has something for everyone to enjoy. I highly recommend this record to old &amp; new fans alike.  Paul proves that he still has the magic.
B00000DGUG|4.0|i must say i don't understand why it was considered uncool by so many people to like Alanis's music... to label her as unoriginal or even a puppet is an ignorant statement by anyone who is aware of the fact that she ACTUALLY writes her music! which is more than we can say for the other pop divas who have been classified as unoriginal packed material. her lyrics are awesome, and though she can whine with the best of them i think her vocal skills are also under-rated. from what i've heard of this album it's really slaps everyone in the face that has tried to pin her in the 'angry girl' catagory, it's worth a good listen.
0394721780|5.0|I have been using this book for over 20 years. It is my cooking Bible. I learned most of what I know about cooking from Julia, her TV show, and her books, but this one is the best, bar none. The recipes are simple. There may be a lot of ingredients, but the dishes are excellent.  Her quiches are unmatched, her Pork Roast melts in your mouth and the Clafouti impresses your guests. My book is falling apart and stained because it has been used so much. I highly recommend you buy it!
B000001ESJ|3.0|...in certain sections of this album. Others I'm still not quite sure about. Now that I have your attention, let me say that Rush's A FAREWELL TO KINGS (1977) does represent a musical step forward in some ways, particularly in its greater use of keyboards and Moog synthesizers than on previous Rush albums. However, compared to its immediate predecessor, the masterpiece known as 2112, it doesn't quite cut it. For one thing, 2112 was a much more cohesive work that shone on all levels, from the 20-minute magnum opus of &quot;2112&quot; all the way to the ferocity of &quot;Something For Nothing&quot;. A FAREWELL TO KINGS is more experimental, and it suffers for not really knowing what--or why--it is. This tends to make it not as much fun to listen to as 2112; however, it does have some very strong moments. Since it marks Rush's first prolonged experimentation with keyboards in general and the Moog synthesizer in particular (after they first briefly appeared on 2112), this remains a very important Rush record. It shows the band in transition between their former raw, heavy sound and the more streamlined, polished sound that they would display in the '80's.<br />A FAREWELL TO KINGS starts out promisingly enough with the beautiful, lilting 1:11 acoustic guitar intro to the title song. However, all hell breaks loose after that, and even though the rest of the song displays the expert off-kilter bass-and-drum signatures of Messrs. Lee and Peart, and the masterful guitar lead breaks by Alex Lifeson, it kind of goes all over the place, and doesn't quite come together in the way that &quot;Overture&quot; did on the previous album. As title songs go, &quot;A Farewell To Kings&quot; just doesn't quite cut it. However, things get much better from here.<br />The two best reasons to buy this CD are the next two songs: the eleven-minute masterpiece &quot;Xanadu&quot; and the under-three-minute classic &quot;Closer To The Heart&quot;. The former is the kind of song you need to sit back and relax with the slow, brilliant five-minute-keyboard-and-synthesizer-laden instrumental that begins it. The latter just makes you want to rock out, period! &quot;Xanadu&quot; is very atmospheric, but don't let that fool you. It does display many sudden time-changes, but it all seems very cohesive and doesn't make you lose interest. &quot;Closer To The Heart&quot; is only the second commercial-sounding song that Rush ever did (&quot;Fly By Night&quot; was the first). It is catchy, concise, and brilliant, all at the same time. Both songs are great!!<br />&quot;Cinderella Man&quot; is the only song on here whose lyrics were written by Geddy Lee. It is actually a well-made mid-tempo rocker that shows Lee with some restraint on his usually-screaming vocals. Most of all, it shows much growth in his lyric-writing skills. Considering that he wrote &quot;I Think I'm Going Bald&quot; just two years earlier, this song is a major step-up for him. &quot;Madrigal&quot; is a beautiful, acoustic tune which, at only 2:35, is the shortest song on this album. Don't know why it's so short; after all, the entire album (which consists of only six tracks) is only 37:30, despite the presence of two 10-minute-plus songs. So, it's not like they wouldn't have had room to stretch &quot;Madrigal&quot; to, say, four or five minutes.<br />The closer is &quot;Cygnus X-1&quot; which, like &quot;Xanadu&quot;, also has a brilliant five-minute-opening instrumental. However, this one is frantic with synthesizers and guitar. This song sets positively scary during the final salvo which has Geddy Lee's screaming vocals enveloped in the surging and whirling of the Moog synthesizer and Alex Lifeson's fast &amp; furious guitar work. It takes at least a few listens to get used to it, and I'm not quite there yet.<br />A FAREWELL TO KINGS is not a CD for the casual rock fan who knows just a few songs by Rush. If all you know by Rush is &quot;Spirit of Radio&quot; and/or &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; and/or &quot;Limelight&quot; and/or &quot;Subdivisions&quot; and/or &quot;Distant Early Warning&quot;, then please buy the albums PERMANENT WAVES, MOVING PICTURES, SIGNALS, and GRACE UNDER PRESSURE first. Then buy this. Of course, you will then want to buy 2112, and possibly the rest of their early catalogue. However, if you're already a big Rush fan and have most of their stuff AND already love &quot;Closer to the Heart&quot; and &quot;Xanadu&quot;, then this is an absolute must-buy. MODERATELY RECOMMENDED
B00005OM4N|4.0|This one is actually good!  My personal favorites are:<BR> <BR>&quot;I'm a Slave 4 U&quot;:  You may be thinking this is the Britney Spears sexual discovery song...and you'd be right.  But it's still got an infectious beat that you can't get out of your head.<br />&quot;Overprotected&quot;:  Even though the topic is indeed calculated, it's still a good song.  Very girl power-inspiring.<br />&quot;Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman&quot;:  OK, so it's a ballad AND it's on the soundtrack to her first movie, but it's still a sweet song.  Probably not indicative of Ms. Spears own feeling, but still a good song.<br />&quot;Anticipating&quot;:  This one reminded me of a Janet Jackson tune or something.  Very upbeat, very light-hearted.  <br />&quot;Let Me Be&quot;:  Again, independence-driven song with a beat that just makes you feel empowered, even if the singer doesn't.<br />OK, so this review is kind of half-bashing Britney Spears and half applauding her.  Just buy the album, and see if YOU can stop listening to it.  Even if you don't like her all that much.  :p

B00003CXZ4|4.0|This film has one thing that makes it really, truly great - the end clears up the central plot completely and will surprise the audience (MAYBE you can figure the \\"what\\" but NEVER the \\"why\\" until the end) while leaving room for interpretation of subplots by the audience. However, lazy viewers beware - the central theme of this film is how we restructure our own past via our memories to make sense of our lives. As in life, not every \\"memory\\" you will see is \\"true\\". The cinematography gives the only clues - there is absolutely no atmosphere at all in the main storyline, but the \\"flashback\\" sequences are stylized based on time, location and condition to help the viewer make sense of the film as a whole. Given some EFFORT, viewers will figure out what is \\"true\\" in the context of the film. The structure and complexity of the film can throw off a viewer unaccustomed to paying close attention - the story is told backward, each scene followed by the scene that precedes it chronologically, allowing the viewer to share the main characters disorientation. Guy Pearce plays a man who cannot make new memories - he forgets everything he has been through since a horrific incident that cost him his memory and his wife. He keeps himself aware of his progress on the quest for his wifes' killer via scribbled notes, annotated Polaroids and tattoos of the most crucial \\"facts\\" in his quest. Viewers adapt quickly and the technique actually increases suspense. It also makes the film hysterically and unexpectedly funny in places. The acting is understated - the characters act like people, not actors - quite refreshing. Guy Pearce is perfect trying to convince everyone, himself included, that he \\"knows\\" what he's doing and has his \\"facts\\" straight. Carrie Ann Moss is GREAT as a bartender who helps Our Hero - more or less. The only thing keeping me from awarding 5 stars is that the DVD extras are pathetic. You get trailers, a couple (literally, two) pictures of the tattoos of the main character, the film website, a copy of \\"Memento Mori\\" - the excellent short story on which the film is based - and an interview with director Chris Nolan. The interview is very good, but the only extra worthy of the name. I would have paid extra for an option to play the film in \\"real time\\", just for kicks. However, the film is excellent and a definite \\"buy me\\". Finally, I leave with a primer for the unobservant:<BR>** Black and white sequences of Guy in his hotel IMMEDIATELY PRECEDE the film time frame and move in NORMAL time (i.e., forward). All other \\"flashbacks\\" are keyed to specific time frames and types of events, but to discuss them, I'd reveal too much. Suffice to say, there is a logical scheme to the flashbacks that will tell the careful viewer exactly what happened - more or less - by the end of the film. (...)

B000002J1S|5.0|What more can I possibly say that has not already been said among the many excellent reviews posted here? I never had much of an appreciation for the band Genesis, but that has definitely changed. When I was growing up in the '80's, Genesis, to me was known mostly for the sound that they had with Phil Collins as the lead singer. At the time, I had no idea that Gabriel was once the lead singer for Genesis, and for a long time I was still clueless to the fact. But I was never really a Genesis fan back then. <br />I'm older now and a lot more musically mature. These days I do not like so much of the new music that is out there and so I find myself looking to the past. Gabriel Genesis is just one of my recent discoveries and I could not be more pleased. This album has been in my home stereo for two weeks now and I do not think it will be leaving anytime soon. As stated before, this is one of those albums that has a bit of everything. I think my only complaint is there are a few songs that are too short, that I wish had been extended. For example: The Rapids - One of the last songs on the album and an awesome song that seems to end just a bit too soon. There is also some funky/corny keyboard playing in certain spots of the album that seems somewhat appropriate for its time, but it seems somewhat out of place on the album. Even so, there are just too many good songs on this album to let the small hang ups that I have about it taint it at all. It really is that good.<br />What a great band Genesis was with Peter Gabriel. That is not to say that Phil Collins did not have his moments when he took over as lead singer, but Genesis just seems like such a different band with Peter Gabriel singing. It almost makes me feel like they should have changed the name of the band when Gabriel left. If you aren't familiar with what I am talking about, do yourself a favor and check out some of Genesis' early works, but most of all, GET THIS ALBUM!

B00004Z459|1.0|... This is by far, the best example of a MTV band. NOTHING sounds original with this &quot;band&quot;! <br />1. Throw in distorted guitars. Not TOO heavy. Wouldn't want it too heavy or it'll hurt everyone's ears!<br />2. Add in a rapper(make sure he's white), and a DJ(who has no idea what he's doing)<br />3. Get a singer who has a lot of &quot;angst&quot;, and have him write songs about his horrible childhood. (&quot;I never got a pony for Christmas! Now I hate everything! Oh! And I'd like to thank my mom and dad and...&quot;)<br />4. BONUS! The singer sounds like a member of N'Sync!<br />But of course, this band will probably win a Grammy sometime or another. It did sell a lot of records you know. After all, that's all the Grammy awards pay attention to. Who can sell the most. This band'll disappear. While that does not mean a band loses talent or anything like that... in this case, however, it'll be a blessing.
B000059TPI|4.0|Jimmy Stewart stars as Elwood P. Dowd, a very ordinary man except for the fact he sees and talks to a large white rabbit (a pooka, actually).  His overwrought sister Veta can't take it anymore, since he is ruining the chances of her daughter Myrtle Mae finding a suitable husband.  She wants to get him committed to the Chumley Sanitarium.  And that's when things begin to get very complicated for all concerned.  As comedies go, Harvey isn't one of those riotous, laugh out loud howlers.  It does have some laugh out loud moments, mostly supplied by the inimitable Josephine Hull as poor Veta.  She's extremely funny, with her quavering, fluttery voice, and expressive eyes.  The comedy is more gentle and rooted in human nature.  Stewart hits all the right notes as Elwood, a terminally calm and happy man who seems much more at peace with himself and the world than the apparently sane people around him.  He and the film leave you questioning what the harm is in a man who sees a big white rabbit, but loves life and making friends and who really disturbs no one.  After all, don't we all have our own oddities and quirks - myself excepted, of course ;) .
0385505833|5.0|Rarely do I laugh out loud while reading a book.  The last half of this book is absolutely hysterical - I was crying!  And I found the ending to be quite touching as well.  This book is a quick read with the easy flow of all Grisham novels.  But there's more to it than meets the eye - some great commentary on modern life.  Sure it's a bit exaggerated, but hello, this is a novel, not reality!  I strongly recommend this book.  One of the best books I've read in a while.

0140288503|5.0|I had heard alot about this book and was starting to see the movie promos on TV when I decided to read it.  Man, I could not put it down it was that good.  What can I say that 340 other reviewers haven't said already?  All I can say is read it before the movie comes out because Bowden's writing produces imagery that would probably be spoiled if you see the movie first.  This book is destined, if not already is, to become a classic story of modern war.
B00000JHAU|5.0|Cruising home in the '81 Caddie and listening to NPR, caught a review of B &amp; S's Boy With the Arab Strap.  Listened once, didn't think much.  Listened again, never stopped.  Bought the entire catalogue.  Got hooked BIG TIME on If You're Feeling Sinister.  Going from &quot;I want a drink of whiskey so I pick up the Major&quot; to &quot;the snow is falling&quot; is so creative and beautiful I want to grab a harmonica and scream it out - though I'd have better luck using the harmonica to strain peaches.  In Like Dylan in the Movies, the line &quot;I will love you&quot; reminds me how deeply I love my wife, my kids...hell, all of humanity.  Buy it?  That's not enough.  Cherish it.  Why isn't this group the most popular in US pop right now?  I don't know, but when my '81 Caddie Piece'o Junk chugs and pops with a new set of problems, I plug in B &amp; S and let it soothe my ride home.  If we don't make it, I'll have something grand to listen to while I wait for help.

0671688782|1.0|I am a psychoanalyst, and so is my husband.  The only reason we own this book is because we brought our children to an intensive workshop held by Martha and her followers.  It was by far the worst experience of my life, my husband's, and my two daughters'.  The children there were forced to lie on mats, and the parents lay on top of them, no matter how small the child was.  This is what Martha means by &quot;holding time.&quot;  The children were practically suffocated.  Then, the parents were told to lick the childrens faces.  That's right - LICK THEM!  These people were so desperate, they were ready to try anything if there was any chance it would make their family lives better.  My children were scarred for life.  They will not forgive me for taking them to this awful place.  My husband, the children and I all agree that this is by no means a helpful organization.  It is a cult, and we are currently looking into shutting it down.  In the book Martha says so many things i disagree strongly with, and could mention here, but I will mention only the first that comes to my mind....<BR>In Holding Time, Martha says that, using her technique, parents can bypass certain stages of childhood.  She states that the terrible two's and teenage rebelion are avoidable.  With the help of her book, or her therapy, or her intensive experiences, Martha says that children can become so connected to their parents that they really do not have bad feelings towards them ever.  All tantrums can be fixed by &quot;holding the child.&quot;  And this is the way to a succesful person growing out of your child.  But I look at succesful people today and I can't imagine that any of their parents were able to skip the hard parts of life, skip the terrible twos, skip puberty.  I, as a mother and a psychoanalyst, think it is more likely that the adults now who used to be a &quot;model child,&quot; who never had one fight with their parents, or never rebelled at all as a teenager, are the least succesful ones today.  Teenage rebelion is completely natural!  Those who avoid it are avoiding their feelings, which is never a good idea.  There are so many more things wrong with what this woman says in this book, I want to keep writing, but I can't possibly name everything.  In any case, I hope you take my advice and disregard anything Martha says in this book.  In fact, please do not buy the book - the more money she has, the more lives she can ruin.
0767802519|5.0|The opening shots of this movie are a bird's eye view flying over New York city and flying into a quaint, locally owned restaurant in the heart of Little Italy.  Therein two men are talking business, and it is not of the establishment in which they are conversing.  A man's life is being discussed, and in the most chilling ways possible.  The mysterious gentlemen accepting the hit is Leon (Sean Reno), and as he hides behind a pair of reflective sunglasses and a foreign accent, he becomes demonized as the viewer realizes he is a cold-blooded killer, a &quot;professional&quot; if you will.<br />And yet he stops by the store on the way to his slightly dilapidated apartment building for two quarts of milk, and then proceeds to iron his clothes, water his plant, and shower while wearing a face of torn emotion.  The demon killer shows a human side, and the viewer is left puzzled.  Even more so is the viewer when this very hitman saves the life of a young girl named Mathilda (young Natalie Portman) from corrupt DEA officers, headed by Gary Oldman, after they massacre her family.<br />The majority of the film is concerned with the development of the relationship between Leon and Mathilda, and Luc Besson could not have done a finer job.  The circumstances are awkward at first for both Mathilda and Leon, and yet as time progresses a unique bond begins to form itself between the two.  Sean Reno as Leon is brilliant.  His accent (said to be Italian, but it sounds awfully French to me), rugged visage, and cold-yet-expressive eyes convey a man with many secrets.  And for all his calm demeanor, he obviously struggles with himself.  Natalie Portman shows herself in her debut as not just another child actor, but someone who, in her own right, displays a natural acting competancy that few adult actors can achieve.  As young Mathilda she walks a razor's edge between projecting herself as a scared little girl that has seen and felt too much pain, and a mature young woman with emotions and understanding belying her age.<br />While violence has become something of a widespread staple in the modern action movie, rarely have there been such powerfully cinematic displays of the consequences.  Luc Besson does not insinuate that he who has the gun is God, but rather that whoever does hold's a god's responsibility.  Almost every significant character in this film that sees violence as an answer see that it only brings pain and more questions.  As fire attracts a moth, so do the worlds of these men bring suffering even as they seek to overcome it.  Additionally, the growing relationship between Leon and Mathilda set off warnings to the prudish viewer of impending sexual relations.<br />One minute this movie incites light-hearted laughter.  The next it could be demanding your ire, only to bring tears afterwards.  The adrenaline joy-ride this movie provides is only topped its roller-coaster of emotions.  The cinematography, while not ground-breaking, is effective in conveying the mood in key scenes.  A brilliant and disturbing portrayal of DEA officer Stansfield by Gary Oldman create a true villian worthy of cinematic infamy for years to come.  Indeed, this movie is much more than the sum of its components, and while the squeamish and easily offended may find themselves tempted to turn this film off early on, those that sit through their discomfort will find not-so-typical tale of two outcasts suffering with little for solace but each other.

B00004XPPB|5.0|Working undercover as a jewel dealer Joe Pistone (Johnny Depp) earns the trust of Lefty Ruggiero (Al Pacino).  Lefty vouches for Joe and brings him into his mob family.  What was supposed to be a three-month assignment for Joe turns into several years.  Joe begins to drift away from his own family and deep into the mob.  He and Lefty form a strong bond and a father son relationship.  When the investigation is coming to an end Joe realizes that his only way out of the mob is to betray his friend.   <br />The film is presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen.  It is a very nice transfer the only flaw I noticed was a hint of grain occasionally.  A Dolby Digital 5.0 audio track is provided.  The surround speakers are hardly used.  When they are its mostly only for music.  With a movie like this that is mostly dialogue its understandable.  This special edition DVD has several extras.  The highlights are a director's commentary, two featurettes, deleted scenes and trailers.  The featurette titled \\"Donnie Brasco: Out of the Shadows\\" was excellent.  It gives a lot of background on the film and contains several interviews with the cast and crew.  The deleted scenes are nice to see but I can understand why they were cut from the film.<br />For those of you thinking this is just another mob movie, you are wrong.  Instead of showing the top of the crime family tree like many other films this one shows the bottom.  It shows soldiers that are scraping at the bottom of the barrel and are just trying to make ends meet.  This is a film that stands on its own on many levels.  It was perfectly cast with Johnny Depp, Al Pacino, Michael Madsen and Anne Heche.  If you like mob movies or just fine acting this is one film you need to see.
B00001QEE9|5.0|The world was still marveling at the astonishing accomplishments the Disney stuido had made with 1937's &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; when this second feature film, &quot;Pinocchio&quot; (and the third, &quot;Fantasia&quot;), came along in 1940.  Quite like most of the other early classics and quite unlike some Disney efforts today, this one never grows old and will continue to endure forever.  <br />The enchanting story of a little wooden puppet who wanted to become a real boy is here told with what is still stunning anamation and real, emotion-filled characters that will warm your heart.  This will not only provide an enjoyable 88 minutes of entertainment but also some wonderful lessons -- lies grow and grow (here, literally); bravery and love always will conquer; do right instead of wrong; bad things happen to you when you do bad things and make bad choices; and, most of all, as Jimminy Cricket says, &quot;Always let your concience be your guide.&quot;<br />The DVD itself only contains one bonus feature -- the original 1940 theatrical trailer -- and while many people are quite upset about this (and the fact that the VHS contains a new behind-the-scenes doccumentary whereas neither the rare OOP Limited Issue or current Gold Collection DVD has this), I myself think that the truly timeless animated classic that is the disc's centerpiece is reason enough to want to add this wonderful movie to your collection, regardless of the lack of DVD extras.  But act quickly - the majestic Blue Fairy and her coworkers at Disney will work their magic once again on January 31, 2002 and discontinue any further printings of this timeless movie for approx. another ten years.  So now is the time to make sure that you own all the magic and fun of this amazing animated feature for the next ten years -- and forever.

B00005BHOG|4.0|This nice little addition provides lots of fun for children who want to drive vehicles around and through their train set. The ramps on either side make it easy for trucks to drive over the tracks. The look is realistic enough that children familar with crossings will recognise and appreciate it. <br />It's not as durable as some Brio train accessories. The plastic arms will not take a lot of abuse. Design-wise, they are appropriate, but if carried around by the gates, I suspect they'd quickly break. <br />It took a bit of practice for my 3.5 year-old boy to correctly press the buttons to raise and lower the crossing gates. For him, it was well worth the effort to play with this fun toy.<br />The magnetic trigger that automatically lowers the gates when a train passes has some problems. Although they're not large ones, they're still disappointing to my son.<br />First, our BRIO Autostop and Start Engine (the green, battery operated engine) doesn't consistently cause the gates to close. This happens frequently, and often for four to five consecutive times. The same problem occurs with other engines and cars, but not to the same extent. <br />Second, each arm triggers independently. When a train rolls past the beginning of the first gate, the magnetic wheel triggers the first gate to close. So far, so good. Then the train drives all the way across the crossing while the other gate is still up until it reaches the far end of the second gate. The magnetic wheel then triggers the second gate. While this provides a good teaching moment to show the child how the toy works, it is NOT the way a *real* crossing operates. Although I understand why the toy is designed this way, attempting to explain it to a 3.5 year-old proved tricky. It definitely bothers him that it doesn't function the same way the real ones do.<br />Even with these two problems, my son still enjoys playing with it. When and if I consider buying another crossing, I'll definitely consider Brio's other offerings.

B00005MAM2|4.0|Akira, as it was for many, was my first introduction to the world of Japanese Anime. It has always held a special place in my collection, and I'm still searching for the anime production that compares. Needless to say, I wholeheartedly recommend this film.<br />As for the review of this release, it is much like the old ivory soap ads.....99.44% pure. I love the original Japanese dialogue. I loved the feature that translates graffiti and other writing. I loved all the behind the scenes extras thrown onto this disc. One thing that I cannot understand is the decision not to include to original english dialogue.<br />While I understand that some people weren't happy with the original dubbing, I must admit that it was one of the things that drew me to the movie originally. Yes, it didn't hold as closely to the Japanese translation as the new dubbing does, but if I wanted the real translation I would have happily watched the subtitled japanese version! Fortunately, I like the Japanese language version, because that is now the only version that I can bring myself to watch. To watch it in English without the old voices that I'm used to is like trying to watch new muppet productions....Kermit just doesn't sound like Kermit! I'm sorry, but it's all I can focus on.<br />Bottom line: If you've never seen Akira, or if you've only seen it once or twice, this version will surely please. But if you grew up listening to the Colonel say, &quot;It's not a soldier's job to make policy. I follow my orders,&quot; you may be disappointed by the new english dialogue. I know I was.

0156012197|5.0|This is one of those lesser known books which falls in the must-read category. The books author, Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry, was a WWII pilot from France. He wrote this book with two sets of readers in mind - the children and the adults. After reading this book the children should vow not to become like adults (which unfortunately they all end up becoming) and the adults sigh and hope they were children once again (which they unfortunately cannot become). The book evokes childish curiosity and selflessness while openly ridiculing adults (and rightly so).<br />The book, illustrated by the author himself, is the story of an Airman's discovery in the desert of a small boy ('The Little Prince') from another planet. The Little Prince recounts his intergalactic travels where he meets kings, conceited men, drunkards, businessmen and lamplighters. All these 'types' of people have some characteristic or the other which the author uses to parody adults. According to Saint-Exup&eacute;ry, all grown-ups fall in one of these categories. The Little Prince's stories only reinforce the Airman's view that all grown-ups are very odd and that they are only concerned with themselves.<br />I read this book whenever I am feeling down and it never fails to lift my spirits up. Of course I moan the fact that I did not read this book when I was a child. Then I might have tried harder not to turn into this conceited, mechanical grown-up with meaningless pursuits.

B00004U8JU|4.0|Jurassic Park is a movie you will never forget. Steven Speilberg has done it again. Although not as good as Jaws, it's a movie that stands on it's own. Sam Neil, proabably the best preformance in his career, is a Dinosoaur reseraching, along with his girlfriend. They are both invited to Jurassic Park. Very good scenes makes this movie a classic.

B00005JKQX|5.0|I've seen this film twice, the second time, taking my elderly mother since she is a big Russell Crowe fan. It was really a pleasure to watch her face as she watched Russell's riveting performance and then see her cry, when &quot;John Nash&quot; received his pens. She was truly moved and of course, so was I.<br />I then came home and &quot;Gladiator&quot; was on HBO, and I sat there, nearly stunned, watching this very same man play an entirely different kind of role and realized what a true chameleon and utterly brilliant film presence Russell is. His ability to encompass a character to the point where he seems to change his skin and color, like the chameleon, is truly amazing. And I challenge anyone who sees this film to not believe they are looking at Russell at age 70. I have NEVER seen an actor age beyone his years more convincingly. (Did anyone think he looked just like another brilliant actor, the late Jason Robards?)<br />I've read a lot of critiques on this film and some have said it oversimplifies or somehow makes light of the illness. I challenge that and say this: when a film works, it works at the level of simplicity, it works when the story is told in the simplest way to achieve the inner truth of its characters and this film does this in spades. The visual way in which Ron Howard and of course, Russell, show us Nash's delusions and paranoia is at its simplest, and therefore we connect and understand. What can be better than that? I also could see so clearly how love can keep a man alive, and Jennifer Connelly was also amazing in this movie. There are also little cinematic touches (e.g., lights) that continue to show us Nash's mind. I say, bravo, Ron Howard.<br />See this film, then watch &quot;Gladiator&quot; and tell me you are not amazed (or, at the very least, &quot;not entertained?&quot;). If there is any doubt as to Russell Crowe's ENORMOUS talent after seeing this film, I say &quot;what exactly are YOU watching?&quot;
B000002NHN|5.0|I absolutely love this CD. I bought it when it first came out but it is still one of my favorites. The music is so relaxing and moving. Whenever I hear it it calls out to me to grab a good book and a cup of coffee and go snuggle up in a big cozy chair. That is quite amazing actually when you consider that we also played this CD during the birth of my first child! It is just that amazing.
0385505833|2.0|Clearly the only reason that this book is on best seller lists is the name John Grisham.  I have read and enjoyed all of his previous books, but this one was boring.  I really cannot think of a redeeming feature.
B00005JKQX|2.0|Perhaps not such a great picture. This is perhaps the dullest movie I've seen since Random Hearts.<br />The story (about a brilliant mathematician who faces his own inner demons) has potential, but director Ron Howard fails to capture much of the spark of earlier films. There is little of the emotional warmth of Apollo 13 in A Beautiful Mind; were it not for the talents of the brilliant (and admittedly beautiful) Russell Crowe, this would not BE a movie. Crowe manages to carry it off, but the film fails to make an emotional connection with the viewer.<br />Especially disappointing was the performance of the actress who plays John Nash's wife. She plays her role with too much stoicism: several times one can see Nash reaching out to her, trying to establish an emotional connection, but it never quite makes it.<br />All in all, this is one film that proves that even a great actor can't make a film great.
B00003CXXI|5.0|What do a smelly ogre, a talking donkey, and a beautiful princess have in common? When they come together, they will make you fall of your chair, couch, or whatever you are sitting in, trying to catch your breath from laughing so hard! Shrek is a fast paced, funny, thrilling, emotional, roller coaster ride that will make you laugh, cry, and worry about the characters as they face a love sick dragon, a rather short dictator, and try to live in a world where fairytail creatures are being banned from their homes.<br />What starts as a adventure to get his home back, Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) finds himself thrown into situations that he has never faced before. He must open his heart, and his home to those who grow to like him. The donkey (voiced by Eddie Murphy) is Shrek's likeable and laughable sidekick on the trek.<br />To get his home back, Shrek must find the princess of an evil &quot;wannabe&quot; king's dreams. With a series of quirky adventures, Shrek finds himself facing something that an ogre has never faced before...Love.<br />But is there something more to the princess that meets the eye? Buy this movie and find out. The laughter is almost nonstop, you find yourself forgetting that these characters are animated, and care for them. It is a good family film, one that everyone can sit down, watch, and enjoy.

B00005OW5V|5.0|In April of 1981, after 12 years of ups &amp; downs, Uriah Heep collapsed in a heap of broken dreams. Ken Hensley who had held the keyboards position, and had been main songwriter had left the band, after more rangour in the ranks, and his replacement Gregg Dechart had definitely not worked out. The last two albums, Fallen Angel (78) &amp; Conquest (79), had been Heep's weakest, the final tour being very difficult for the band (support band \\"Rage\\" had blown them off the stage every night) and quite frankly, agony for the paying public. On the last night of the tour drummer Chris Slade left to join Gary Numan and, after realizing he had set his sites a little low, later joined \\"The Firm\\" with Paul Rodgers &amp; Jimmy Page before taking over the drum seat with \\"AC / DC\\". Bassist Trevor Bolder joined Wishbone Ash, talented vocalist John Sloman was let go after trying to take over the show, leading the band in a very unheep like direction, leaving. The only remaining founding member Mick Box, with the name, but no band.<br /> After a couple of months of staring at the inside of the bottom of a bottle of vodka, band agent Neil Warnock coaxed Mick out to give it one more go. Mick's first telephone call went to long time cohort drummer Lee Kerslake (who'd only originally left the Heep over a falling out with Ken Hensley) having just been fired by \\"Ozzy Osborne\\", Lee was glad of his old job back and became Heep's 5th &amp; 7th drummer, although to be fair he has been with the band 28 years in total now. Also just sacked from Ozzy's band was the great \\"Bob Daisley\\" on bass, (Heep's 6th Bassist), so he was dragged along by Lee Kerslake adding his considerable songwriting skills to the party. Mick Box had always admired the skills of keyboard player John Sinclair from the disbanded \\"Heavy Metal Kids\\", so he became Heeps 3rd keyboard player. The final part of the jigsaw was put together when vocalist Peter Goalby (Heep's 4th) was lured away from \\"Trapeze\\".<br /> The new band then retired to the studio with producer Ashley Howe to emerge 2 months later with ABOMINOG, a classic in hard hitting melodic rock.<br /> From the moment Mick Box's guitar riff hits you on opener \\"Too Scared To Run\\" you know you are in for a sumptious ride. Goalby's vocals are perfect for the Heep sound, Sinclair's keyboards fill up all the gaps and include some truly exciting solos, Bob Daisley's songwriting skills have never been better shown off, Mick Box stomps his authority all over the guitar parts, wah - wah there, slide here, &amp; as many twenty note a second solo's as any heart could desire. It's perhaps Lee Kerslake who's the real star here though, as his drums drive Heep on to glory.<br /> Incredibly the album was a great critical &amp; commercial success, including hit singles, two of the covers \\"That's The Way It Is\\" by Paul Bliss, &amp; the stomping \\"On The Rebound\\" by Russ Ballard.<br /> Abominog was the spur that put Uriah Heep back on the tracks, and they are still going today, although only Kerslake &amp; Box remain from this line up, long may Mick Box lead his warriors into action.<br /> For those of you wondering what an Abominog is, it's an Abominog of course.<br />Mott the Dog.etired to the studio with producer Ashley Howe to emerge 2 months later with ABOMINOG, a classic in hard hitting melodic rock.<BR> From the moment Mick Box's guitar riff hits you on opener \\"Too Scared To Run\\" you know you are in for a sumptious ride.

B00005QZWI|5.0|Having Howard Shore compose the score for the Fellowship of the Ring was a gamble, and it paid off. The score is filled with powerful emotion, and Shore manages to impart to the listener the inner core of the film (and, of course, Tolkien's story) which is the waging of war between good and evil, but not always with the most apparently powerful of things.<br />&quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; is probably my favourite track on this CD - it has a special simplicity to it that is simply wonderful. Also great is track 17 - The Breaking of the Fellowship - which features stunning and heartrending vocals by a boys choir, with Edward Ross as soloist. Enya also does a good job; singing Howard Shore's arrangements rather than her own maintains the continuity of the work.<br />This a film score that can be listened to and enjoyed on its own, filled with simple beauty and cathartic vocals, nobility, power, and suffering - it's all here. Howard Shore has done great justice to Peter Jackson's and Tolkien's visions.
B00005B36H|5.0|Lateralus rivals the wonder that a fan hears when listening to &quot;undertow&quot; and &quot;aenima&quot;. The lyrics and music of this cd are absolutely amazing, and true to the power that TooL has always shown on the music scene. <br />TooL has been around since the mid to late 80's and they are still very much liked by the younger fans today. Their cds are always as good as the one before, if not better, and this one is no exception.<br />With songs like &quot;parabola&quot;, &quot;schism&quot;, and &quot;ticks and leeches&quot;, along with many other songs with as much power, this cd definately shows you the side of TooL that we have been missing since &quot;aenima&quot; came out what seems like so long ago.<br />Maynard has one of the greatests voices in the music industry today. His voice will bring you into the cd, and not let you out until the final second of the last song ticks away. Lateralus is definatly a high mark on TooL's already impressive resume.
6304712936|5.0|Movies about the lives of the great composers are very few.  On those occasions when they are released they are often so exaggerated that they can not be credible as biographical accounts.<BR>&quot;Amadeus&quot; is a movie about Mozart, and while a great liberty has been taken (about Salieri killing Mozart) it still has enough information to be credible.<BR>If you know the life of Mozart well, you would know Mozart died of some kind of fever, not in the hands of Salieri (although in actuality Constanze, Wolfgang's wife, did support rumors of Salieri's guilt over her husband's death).  Mozart had two children (not one),  three of Mozart's students and friends: Eybler, Freystadler, and Suessmayr finished the Requiem (not Salieri), And Mozart's sister in-law, two dotors, Herr Suessmayr, several musicians (helping to finish the Requiem Mass), and his wife Constanze were all with Wolfgang on his death bed (not just Salieri, and Constanze was not in the Baden spa due to dysfunctions with her marriage- which also is pure fiction. She actually went to that spa due to a foot ailment months before the death of the composer).<BR>Despite these small liberties Amadeus still has enough biographical items to be praised. (The bad relationship between Leopold and Constanze, the timing of his father's death, Mozart's disagreements with the archbishop, Joseph II's ban on the play Le Marriage de Figaro, etc.)<BR>&quot;Amadeus&quot; is also a beautifully filmed work.  The choice of locations and costume seem to accurately reprent Europe in the eighteenth century.  The acting is deeply felt (Abraham's Salieri is superbly acted).<BR>The flow of this movie is never tedious, not even for a second.  The action is natural and you feel you can watch this movie many times.<BR>The soundtrack is excellent (even if you do not perfer Rococo/Classical/Romantic music) and it is a necessary companion to the purchase of &quot;Amadeus&quot; on VHS or DVD.
B00005QZWI|5.0|One of the things i really loved about the Lord of the Rings movie was the wonderful soundtrack. I has many great themes, but my favorite is the one heard in &quot;Concerning Hobbits.&quot; It is very light and upbeat, but with a melancholy tune. I think this is the best soundtrack written in my entire life.(But I may have to change my mind...I'm only 13) If you cmpare this soundtrack to Star Wars, it is much more interesting musically. Star Wars has only one theme hear in each song, while this one has at least three heard in different parts of the movie. While listening to this you can visualize the scenes that each song comes from. Now that is really a good soundtrack!
B00004WG2X|5.0|It is obvious that fans of Jane Austen are divided on the subject of movie adaptions, especially with &quot;Pride and Prejudice.&quot;  My father brought this film home from the library when I was 8 (I'm 18 now) and we all sat down and watched it.  Since then it has become a staple in our movie library.  Why?  Let me explain.  There are a few characters in P&amp;P that really make or break an adaption if they are cast poorly -- Elizabeth, Darcy, Mrs. Bennet, Mr. Bennet, and Charlotte are a few I find important.  In this 80s BBC version, Elizabeth is played perfectly in all ranges of emotions (whereas the later A&amp;E version's Elizabeth is just horrible and boring), Darcy softens before your eyes, Mrs. Bennet makes you love to hate her for all her nerves and nagging, Mr. Bennet is a perfect partner to Mrs. Bennet, and Charlotte really works well as Eliza's older friend.  All the characters I have mentioned are terrible in the A&amp;E version, even though certain plot elements are present that are not present in this 80s adaption.  I really think it is important for any adaption not to feel hurried because it needs to capture the slowness of daily life that is only interrupted by planning for parties, throwing parties, and gossiping after parties.  If you feel that the Elizabeth in the A&amp;E version falls flat, then I suggest you try this adaption.  The costumes are lovely, the scenery (especially at Pemberly) is beautiful, and Darcy and Elizabeth have some wonderful scenes together.  In another review it was mentioned that Garvie captures Elizabeth's sharpness and I would add, her quick wit.  I think your preference of adaptions depends on which characters mean the most to you from the perspective of the book.  I never liked Jane, for example, so I was glad to see her pushed somewhat into the background.  One thing I really miss from all versions is the commentary that is made by Elizabeth about her father, the point where she realizes what he has done to his family when with his intellect they could have all been so much more.  I also miss Lydia's letter in the end of the book, it always makes me chuckle.  Overall, I urge you to try this film out, the second part of it is superior to the first in my opinion but maybe I am just in a hurry to see Darcy and Elizabeth grow closer.ily when with his intellect they could have all been so much more.

B00005JKQX|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen this year. A great performance by both the leading man and woman. A great storty with both action and drama, no needless violence or sex. An adult movie, good direction and great story telling. So many movies seem to be just a showcase for special effects, but forget the story is the thing that makes a movie, without a great story all else is lost. A must see.
B00003CWL6|5.0|This movie really moved me.  Some movies do it, others go by the wayside.  Unfortunately, it has taken me two years to notice this film, but wow!  Spacey gives another great performance, and the rest of the cast isn't bad either.  The director played out his vision in the most beautiful manner.  Everyone owes it to him or herself to witness this creation of brilliance.  Those that find themselves disappointed with it don't understand what the film is about.
B000050XEI|2.0|I don't know but where i come from people have to talk loud to be noticed and this is no exception. I thought it was poetic, even sad, and downright unbearable as some of the songs. when it started out the first song i could barely stand the loneliness of the feeling of the song. but i wanted to hear how she sound LIVE without the benefit of the voice overs and studio sound enhancement. i dont think that she would sound very good live. The cd was short but it fit into the context i guess sort of like a mini play or a project. it did work together with the placement of songs. But i dont think she would sound very good live. Celine Dion needs to show her a lesson in singing live. She needs to open up her throat-hole and EMOTE EMOTE EMOTE. Thats the secret of Celine's success. You ever heard the expression 'The squeaky wheel gets the grease', well enya needs to sing LOUDLY. Celine needs to groom her.<BR>Thank you.
B00003CXB7|5.0|I grew up watching the reruns of MASH on TV and I loved the tv show...so I went out and rented the movie.. Since 20TH Century Fox has put the movie and the first season out on DVD I went out and got them both..Im glad I picked these DVDs up
B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty was quite a delightful surprise when I witnessed it.  First off, I came into the movie with no insight whatsoever as to its content.  In fact, I had hardly known of its existence other than the cover until tonight.  Anyhow, this movie was simply wonderful.  The acting was superb.  Spacey stands as one of the most rewarding actors of our time, and his performance here remains strong.  The rest of the cast delights as well.  What's more important than the cast, though, is the sheer brilliance of the directing and the actual subject matter at hand.  All I can really say is bravo to the staff and team responsible for making this film happen.  Rent it, buy it, see it.
0783226063|2.0|In these days, most people talk about the difficulties of bringing J. R. R. Tolkien's epic tale, LORD OF THE RINGS, to the bring screen; We all know that doing the same with DUNE is numerous times more difficult.<br />Even DUNE has its moments, most people will say, and that's true. There are glimpses of stunning visuals that occasionally makes this movie a worth-while experience, but in the end (and that's what counts) this is a complete &quot;mishmash&quot; adaptation of Frank Herbert's classical science fiction novel. There are several things that's wrong with DUNE, but, most importantly (I think), the film just hasn't been given enough time to tell its story. This should have been a three hour movie; 131 minutes just isn't sufficient time. In addition, Lynch has decided, for some reason, to use his prescious time introducing several things that were never in the original story, and they don't make much sense. Dino De Laurentiis wanted DUNE to be his STAR WARS, but instead he ended up with one of the great &quot;turkeys&quot; of the eighties. From what I've read, the only reason why David Lynch agreed to direct this film was so that he'd get full creative control on his next project, BLUE VELVET. Hmm... Perhaps that's reason enough why we shouldn't badger David Lynch too much about doing DUNE.<br />I wouldn't recommend DUNE to anybody save for Lynch fans who wants to see or own this film strictly as a curiousity.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I'm not a musical movie fan (I cared very little for 'The Sound of Music...but I did watch it), so I approached this movie with trepidation.  My biggest regret now, is that I didn't go see it on the big screen; I'm sure it must've been even more dazzling than the DVD on my little TV.<br />The musical story surrounds the life of a young man named Christian (played by Ewan McGregor) who comes to Paris in 1900 in search of life's inspiration (sounds kinda corny, I know, but keep reading) and finds it at the Moulin Rouge --- a famous dance hall of the period that really existed.  He stumbles upon Louie Lautrec (forgive the spelling, please) who was a brilliant poster artist and general artist (and doomed alcoholic) for the Moulin Rouge but here is given a larger role as a bohemian actor.  And from here Christian comes into contact with Satine (Nicole Kidman), a beautiful cortisan who aches to be a true actress.  Christian is immediately taken with her but so is another that night: a Duke who is deathly jealous of anyone who 'touches his things.'  He soon considers Satine 'one of his things.'  Initially Satine mistakes Christian for the Duke and unknowingly falls in love with him.  But soon she discovers that he is NOT the Duke, but it's too late.  She loves him, but he has no money...and the Duke does.  He can make her the actress she's always wanted to be.  What's a girl to do?<br />The story is as old as Romeo and Juliet (star crossed lovers forced apart by greater circumstances).  There are obvious parallels to the recent movie 'Shakespeare In Love' as well.  But that's where similarities end and epiphany in Hollywood began; Someone left a director to his/her own devices!  And look what happened...BOOM! instant success and a possible classic.<br />The filming of the sequences is dazzlingly and dizzingly perfect!  The sets and costumes were perfect!  And the acting was incredibly engaging (even for Kidman!).  The mesh of music, past and present, gave it a surreal quality---as if you were relegated to another plain of existence.  The dance scenes were...well...they left me speechless.  The scene with 30 couples doing the Tango left my mouth agape (dancing to an incredible version of Stings 'Roxanne').<br />I was initially worried that the combination of music from the present with footage of 1900 Paris might be too close to another failed movie (A Knight's Tale), but this was not so.  This is on an entirely different level.  A level that I, as of yet, have seen no equal in the musical movie making industry.  I'm buying this one!lity---as if you were relegated to another plain of existence.  The dance scenes were...well...they left me speechless.

B00005RFAI|5.0|Pink, who is fresh into her 20's, makes a big stride over the street pop that is now vanilla and uninspired (Destiny's Child, Mya, 702, Monica, Brandy). She instead pursues bigger &amp; better things, with a lot more depth for listener's to get something from. You can experience the gut-wrentching pain she lets loose on &quot;Family Portrait&quot;, a story of how torn her family life was. I know gut-wrentching sounds a bit dramatic, but try listening to this song after a big argument with your mother or father. You can FEEL Pink. I also love the uplifting and more positive tracks like &quot;18 Wheeler&quot; (although you can't avoid getting run over, never stay down) and &quot;Missundaztood&quot; (I can relate, I hate the social standards society places on youth). Did I mention Pink sings like an angel when she wants, and can also rock out with a gritty and growly low voice??? She's so versatile and talented. Highly, actively recommended.
0451204530|2.0|The story wasn't bad, but I was appalled at all the anachronisms and mistakes.  People making Xerox copies in 1958 and working for National Public Radio 15 years before it goes on the air. Most glaring is Neil Armstrong's walk on the moon in 1968, one year before it happened.
B000056N8X|1.0|I loved the first 3 and own all of them on DVD.  If given this one, I'd throw it away.  Completely disregarded the story line for the first 3.  The entire Highlander premise was popular and this dismal effort was made only to capitalize on the popularity.  They've ruined any possibility for another movie.
6300213668|5.0|I have seen Grease and Grease 2 so many times, I know every last line in each movie.  I have always loved those 2 movies.  I have been watching them since I was in elementary school and I'm a grown woman now.  Those 2 movies are classics.

B00004Y6Q5|5.0|Darren Aronofsky's adaptation of Hubert Selby's Requiem For A Dream manages to pull off a rare trifecta in media today: great book, great film, great soundtrack. On the soundtrack, Clint Mansell (formerly of Pop Will Eat Itself) takes centre stage, and he creates the perfect aural companion to a spectacular book and a mindbending movie. It's flat-out amazing.<br />What cinches it is the performance by the formidable auteurs Kronos Quartet. If ever there are a film made that suited Kronos perfectly, it's this. Their combination of subtlety and outright cacophony is both gorgeous and jarring. The Quartet's music meshes perfectly with Mansell's electronic experimentation, and the cd is presented as a suite, with three movements, just like the book and the film. There's the menace below the surface in Summer, the impending doom of Fall, and as for Winter, well, brace youself, and prepare to get a major case of the palm sweats. The last twenty minutes, with its arresting screeches inspired by Bernard Herrmann is some of the most riveting music I have ever heard. Play it loud late at night, and experience some incredibly intense music. And pleasant dreams...

B00005KHJR|5.0|The Wicker Man takes you on a journey to a fantastic island where sexual orgies exist, naked women leaping over bonfires, and a beautiful Britt Ekland singing and dancing naked--a strange scene but beautiful to watch. What you have is a film that is a musical, horror, drama, mystery--it is everything. And it contains a surprising ending that will fool the first time viewer the same as how the protagonist was fooled in the film. This limited edition DVD is definitely worth the money. If you are a true film lover, then you will not be disappointed with your viewing of The Wicker Man.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|A ground breaking revolutionary film that is just as revolutionary as a DVD. Baz Luhrman gives us a full DVD plus more of fabulous extras. Buy this DVD!

B0000004V2|5.0|This is the one and only album I would want with me on a desert island.  It has been my favorite CD since it was initially released and it remains at the top of my CD pile today.  I strongly recommend it to any music lover.  The first few bars of \\"She Bangs the Drums\\" has the ability to instantly put me in a good mood and \\"This is the One\\" still sends shivers up my spine.  Buy one copy for yourself and one as a gift for someone you love.
B00005QDW1|3.0|This CD was worse than &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;, but somewhat better than &quot;Return of Saturn&quot;. There are a few OK, melodic, catchy songs. My fave was &quot;Hey Baby&quot;, which is saying something, because it's not an unforgettable song. But some of the songs, like &quot;Detective&quot;, were the stupidest I've ever heard. Some of the songs go into a sort of reggae feel, and some are almost-rock. They all have a bit of an electronic feel, but overall, this CD is not very good and not very bad. It's all right. If you think you like the electronic stuff, go for it. Depending on who you are, you may or may not like this CD.
059035342X|5.0|The Harry Potter series had me up all day and night. I couldn't put it down. I, personally felt attached to the characters. The author is superb in keeping you guessing and wanting for more when the book is over.<BR>I highly recommend these books not only to childrens but to adults as well!
B00005Q66T|3.0|I returned this CD at the store. I was disappointed their were no mixes like the one's in her singles.  Most of the songs were ok but I wasn't too thrilled with the way the songs were laid out. Perhaps settling down didn't agree with her career. She needs to come up with new music that can have more club like mixes so she can let her beautiful voice be heard. It's like her potential isn't at all in this album. She can do better. Perhaps this album was made when she was busy or not in tuned with her fans. So overall I don't recommend this CD if you are looking for music to play while you drive unless you enjoy hearing her old stuff without any added background music to enhance the songs. I could've made a tape or CD by combining all her albums too. It is no wonder I was disappointed.
B00004U2G4|5.0|If you can't, then you don't appreciate rock'n'roll at its toughest.  Jeff Beck is arguably the rock world's No. 1 guitar legend, next to Hendrix that is.  This was his first solo gig after he left The Yardbirds (and by the way, it was Beck who made that band, not Clapton!).  This is simply a pedal to the metal, 4 on the floor, all-out work out.  Joined by a then-unknown Rod Stewart and Ron Wood, Jeff reinterprets old favorites and reinvents the blues, with such standout numbers like &quot;Shapes of Things&quot;, &quot;Blues Deluxe&quot;, and the superb &quot;Rock My Plimsoul&quot;.  Add to this some unique twists such as &quot;Old Man River&quot;, &quot;Morning Dew&quot; and the mesmerizing &quot;Beck's Bolero&quot;, and you've got an album that can't be topped.  When I was in college, I played this album nearly every day. Over 20 years later, I still do.  When my son gets older, he'll listen to it every day with me. It is a must have if you are a fan of guitar-driven rock and blues.<br />The digital remastered CD adds new richness that was only hinted at on vinyl.  A must have for any serious collector.  Forget Zep, forget Slowhand....this guy wrote the book that those others only dreamed they could have written.  One of the 15 best rock albums ever recorded.  As the liner notes say, PLAY IT LOUD.  And that, my friends, is the TRUTH.
0790743523|5.0|I would like to see this movie colorized. It is such a great adventure movie, I think color would enhance the experience. Humphrey Bogart's performance is tremendous, as is Walter Huston's.  This is another one of those lost treasure/buried treasure flicks I have a weakness for..but the best of the lot. Starting with panhandling in the streets in Mexico, to high drama in the Sierras, it keeps you on the edge of your seat with suspense. Of course when the banditos come, who can forget the now cultish saying: &quot;Badges?...We don't need no stinking badges!&quot; Great performances by all, and Bogey at his best.
B00003CXWV|4.0|Its easy to feel compassion for George Jung, and BLOW, certainly tries to stoke compassion, but the true quality of this movie is the way it tells a classic American tale about ambition and greed through an everyman, a small man. This is no hero, more a stooge of larger forces, like the Columbian gangs he introduced to American markets, and American law.<br />Johnny Depp gives his character the raw edge, the off-center determination to succeed at all costs, but also poignancy. Only we never learn where his flair for ideas comes from. His dysfunctional family makes him human, but there is a dimension to his character that is missing. Is it just middle-class industriousness twisted into illegal ambition for lack of another outlet?<br />Paul Rubens gives the movie some notoriety, but his role is not that pivotal, nor his role memorable. It is Depp, operating in his character's mystery zone, that delivers and carries the whole effort. The story is the heart of the movie, and could perhaps have been more documentary and less personalized without losing its focus: the American fairy tale
B00005NWM3|5.0|This album is great. It is a combination of groups like 3 Doors Down and Creed. All the songs are great. My favorite songs are How You Remind Me, Too Bad(awesome), Just For, Woke Up This Morning, and Good Times Gone. Anyway all the songs are GREAT.I think my favorite 2 songs of this magnificifent album are How You Remind Me and Too Bad. Man they rock!.. They dont need lousy and loud riffs. Great lyrics and good melodic riffs that fit the song make this album awesome. The main riff of &quot;Just For&quot; reminds me of Nirvanas &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;. Dont miss this album.
B00003CXAA|5.0|THE GODFATHER is a phenomenon, commercial and artistic, and is proof that art can influence life. Its a mythic contribution to the search for the perfect American fairy tale, about greed, ambition, family, and guilt. Only in its soap-opera-esque potrayal of the multi-faceted world of organized crime does the film have its strength and weakness. By simplifying this world using iconic characters it makes the mafia approachable, but it also avoids the ugly, inconvenient details.<br />Each film has its own quality. Part I and II compete in most viewers' hearts for favorite status, and Part III is universally regarded as substandard. But, as the documentary shows, all three are flawed, due to artistic compromises. Scenes in the first two films are now iconic, such as Santino's Assassination in Part I and the epipany in Part II. Each film is story-driven, but, like the &quot;Abortion&quot; scene in Part II demonstrates, it is also a story with characters, something disappearing from film in general.<br />However substandard Part III may be, it is necessary, because the movie, as a whole, is not about gangsters, but Michael. Numerous other films, inspired by THE GODFATHER and starring Al Pacino, have portrayed organized crime more realistically, but THE GODFATHER is the simple tale of one man trying to be an American.<br />The deleted scenes provided in the fifth disc are gems that flesh out characters even more. The documentary also inserts the movie in the corporate politics of the movie industry that is a part of the American fairy tale. This is the second time (later, in APOCALYPSE NOW) Coppola's wife has examined a film by her husband, and almost outdoes him for clarity and succinctness. <br />What makes the film so engaging is also so disturbing. That viewers indentify with characters only proves the power of the American fairy tale on Americans. THE GODFATHER is a mirror on our souls.
B00004NRWH|5.0|I don't know what's with all the 1 star reviews saying they're copying other rockers.  That's ridiculous.  All rock sounds about the same just like all pop sounds alike. Nickelback is a rock group. They might have similar voices as other bands, they use guitars (yeah if they didnt it wouldnt be rock), and awesome background vocals &amp; cool melodies.  Yes they happen to sound a little like Bush, but i cannot stand Bush mainly because of Gaven's voice.  Don't say they are copying other bands when there really is no such thing.  Rock is rock, pop is pop, rap is rap, its all practically the same thing.  Nickelback has good music, a fine voice, &amp; reasonable lyrics.  If you don't want a rock album go buy Britney Spears.  Anyways, this cd is awesome.  Everyone has their own taste in music artists so i can't guarantee you would like it....but you should definitely give it a listen. Rock is rock...and this ROCKS
B00005QZ7U|5.0|MOULIN ROUGE ROCKS!... Literally!  The music used in the film was made famous by other artists, but they seem completely new when sung by Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman.  Baz Luhrmann, the director and co-writer, used the lyrics from famous songs by The Beatles, Madonna, Sting, Elton John, Marlyn Monroe, etc., to tell the story and what the characters are thinking.  Unlike some musicals, the songs actually move the plot forward.  The songs are the story.<br />Ewan McGregor (Star Wars Ep. 1) and Nicole Kidman (The Others, A <BR>Far Off Place) have excellent, excellent, excellent chemistry in this movie.  Kidman plays a prostitute that never lets herself love anyone because it will interfere with her work.  McGregor plays a boy obsessed with love.  Both of their voices blew me away, especially McGregor's.  I never would've thought that they could pull it off.  I expected Kidman to have a screechy Mariah Carey wannabe voice, but I was very wrong.<br />Baz Luhrmann (director of Romeo and Juliet + Strictly Ballroom) has made an incredible piece of art.  The visuals alone deserve to win a few Oscars, which I'm sure it will.  He has made a movie targeted to the VH1 audience with the MTV effects.  Together they make a stunningly beautiful film.  I was in awe and still am.<br />This movie is a modern classic that is definitely worth the time and money.  Buy it!
B00005NP04|4.0|This album is an example of a perfect `Greatest Hits' collection.  It shows such sensitivity towards old fans, understanding of what newcomers and casual fans want, and respect for Martina's music.  <br />The fans are rewarded with 4 new songs that are good enough to be on this collection (rather than the throwaways they could have been), plus some gorgeous photographs and thoughtful, revealing comments on every song from Martina and long-time producer Paul Worley.<br />The 18 songs are an excellent introduction to Martina, almost spanning her career and representing all aspects of her music - heartfelt ballads ('Strangers'), fun rockers ('When God-fearin' women get the blues', 'Wild Angels'), upbeat love songs ('I love you', 'Safe in the arms of love') and impassioned issues songs ('Independence Day', 'A Broken Wing').  Even if you don't like some tracks, there are enough for this to be great value!  The chronological order and informative commentary put the songs in perspective, and it's also great as a sampler, with info on which songs come from which album if you want to explore further.  <br />Martina's careful role in the project is obvious.  I love her charmingly honest notes on which songs she doesn't like so much, and inclusion of a non-single fan favourite.  <br />Her first album and Christmas album aren't covered so this isn't a comprehensive set, but that way it maintains quality.  This is a five star album for fans of contemporary chart country, and I hope others like me who aren't into `mainstream country' enough to want individual albums discover this set and Martina's wonderful music!
1573225517|4.0|I saw the movie before I read this book, and I liked the movie version, but it was sort of hard to figure out whether I liked the movie for itself, or because of the cool feeling that went along with knowing the chicago neighborhoods and landmarks shown throughout the film. In any case, I liked the film enough to go out and try to find the book. Now, I usually don't like both reading the book and seeing the movie, but in this case I'm glad I did. This book was a lot of fun to read. Guys, read this book, because its a rare male perspective on things that seem like they're always written about by women. You'll find yourself completely understanding how Rob thinks and acts, seeing shades of yourself, and maybe even get some perspective on how our typical guy behavior appears to outsiders. Females, read this book just to get some insight into the world of the guy mind, a place governed by its own separate set of logical rules and axioms, that make complete sense and are valid to themselves, but sometimes with no real connection to the external world. Maybe you'll be able to figure out some of your crazy boyfriends. And thats as good a reason to read a book as any.
B000003TA4|5.0|I believe Nirvana was one of the greatest bands of all time. Some may say Kurt wasn't a good guitar player or whatnot, but listen to the lyrics of this album and try to figure out exactly what they mean. It's in the lyrics and how they're delivered were Smells Like Teen Spirit starts to shine, Kurt is an amazing composer and vocalist who left before his time, take a moment to listen to any of the songs on this album, I think they're all good especially lithium, which is personally my favorite song of all time.As long as your a fan of good music this cd is definetly worth buying.
B0000508U6|4.0|Coldplay has one of the best American debuts of the year with this CD, a disc full of touching songs, true meaning, and wimpiness a lot better than Five For Fighting's fake inability to cope with the world. No, Coldplay does it better-and I'm waiting to see the Radiohead comparisons come on out.<br />Songs like &quot;Shiver&quot; and &quot;Trouble&quot; show oh-so-well the ability of Coldplay to sing about their relationship troubles without sounding like they need to head off to preschool. &quot;I never meant to cause you trouble,&quot; a lyric in &quot;Trouble,&quot; is clear/apologetic/believable too. The piano in &quot;Trouble&quot; is one of the most unforgettable progression of notes since George Harrison's guitar weeped in the Beatles' &quot;Something.&quot; <br />Why do we like &quot;Yellow&quot; too? Well, it seems to me that Coldplay's earnestness has to do with it. The song itself doesn't make much sense, but the feeling put into words such as &quot;it was all yellow&quot; is almost tear-inducing (in a good way).<br />All in all, it is that earnestness that brings Coldplay one of the best CDs to beam over from Britain lately. As long as they show that they mean what they sing (and dangitanyway if they don't), they should prosper in the States.
0385486804|3.0|Krakauer is a strong writer when writing from first hand experience, as Into Thin Air and the reflective chapter about his younger years in Into The Wild show. This reflective chapter, though it adds little to the story, is a gripping account of Krakauer's ascent of the Devils Thumb in Alaska, and the writing style is leagues ahead of the rest of the book. But perhaps the subject of Chris McCandless's adventure made writing this book harder. Though interesting, the subject matter is hardly gripping, really just quite a common story of young rebellion going horribly wrong.<BR>The best part of the book is that it does encourage you to reflect on what went wrong; was Chris McCandless trying to push his limits to the edge like many young people do and simply went too far, or was he a naive youngster whose arrogance led to his death? Unfortunately I can't recommend your time in reading this book to answer the question. Read Into Thin Air, it's excellent, but skip this one.

B00003CXN4|3.0|This movie really reinforced my concern of Hollywood trying to depict realistic areas of the country. I know Cincinnati was portrayed in such a way to add drama to the film, but it really made me squirm to sit and watch a movie that was supposedly showing what life was like in downtown Cincinnati. I know a lot of good folks who come from urban areas of our city, and although it isn't the easiest place to live I don't think everyone there is the scum of the earth. Unfortunately the scenes in the movie made me feel like thats what they are supposed to be in the eyes of the audience. Maybe I've been very naive in the viewing of my surroundings, but I felt like my town was made uglier than it is. Just like any other major city, we have poverty and drug problems that need to be remedied. But I've never seen High school students in blue blazers and I've never seen drug dealers yell out like ticket scalpers to passing cars. I would assume anyone who wants to stay on the street more than a week has to be a bit more subtle when peddling illegal wares.<br />Some may think I'm being nitpicky, and I admit that its been a while since I've seen the film. But I guess it was more of an eye opener because the film was shot in my backyard. It makes me appreciate the reality of documentary as opposed to Hollywood interpretation.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I won't go too much into the details, but let me say that this might well be my favorite movie of the 90s. Seen from the perspective of insanity, the movie does an excellent job at letting us (me, anyway) sympathize with the protagonist's cynical stance on society. Excellent visuals and acting (I knew about Norton, but I frankly didn't think Pitt was this good), this might well be Fincher's best work to date. The DVD is one of the most complete around!
B000002LK1|5.0|When I got this album I was absolutely blown away. I had heard only 3 songs of DM's, &quot;People Are People&quot;, &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot;, and half of &quot;Policy of Truth&quot;. This album is just a masterpiece; SO worth your time and money!!!<BR>It starts off with the dancy, awesome &quot;World in my Eyes&quot; and the lyrics in this song are so cool. Right when I heard this I got up and started bouncing around the kitchen and clapping my hands in excitement.<BR>&quot;Sweetest Perfection&quot; is slow and seducing, something to calm you down after all the energy in &quot;World in My Eyes&quot;. Dave Gahan's voice sounds really nice in this song too&lt;=)<BR>&quot;Personal Jesus&quot; is so funky! I love it! It combines the synth sound with actual guitar. The song is almost edgy but makes you want to grin too. The end is AWESOME too,totally danceable!<BR>&quot;Halo&quot;-what a song, what a song. You get the feeling that maybe a guy and his girl got into trouble and have to pay the price but their love will get them through. It has such a cool, intense beat and will inspire you!<BR>&quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot;-their famous song, and you can see why. Extremely danceable and appealing, it rings with a kind of dedication and love~&quot;Can't you understand, oh my little girl, all I ever wanted, all I ever needed is here in my arms...&quot;<BR>&quot;Policy of Truth&quot;-this song has just a terrific beat and witty, catchy lyrics that grab your attention and make you think. This song has a neat bridge in it and is great for dancing around to.<BR>&quot;Blue Dress&quot;-I really love this song because Martin Gore's voice is SO romantic and sincere and simple (why doesn't he get to sing more songs?! lol), and I love the other-worldly sound and continuos beat. The thing I like about this song is that you never know what the heck he's singing about until you read what the title of the song is. You're like, what does he mean when he sings, &quot;Put it on&quot; over and over? That's the cool thing about DM...never ordinary!!<BR>&quot;Clean&quot;-I never really cared much for this song until one night I wanted to hear something other than their usual stuff and so I went to track 9 and here was this cool song! I like the melody and the fact that you keep waiting for a beat to break out in the song but it never really quite happens. It leaves you holding on. <BR>GET THIS ALBUM!!! It appeals to almost everyone I think because has everything packed in it: romance, lust, dance songs, slow songs, happiness, depression, etc. And every sing sounds different than the last! So what are you waiting for?!:)

B000002LCI|5.0|This is a GREAT album, no question about it. It's a little heavier than &quot;Violator&quot; which I also have (I need more DM CDs!! Sob, sob...) but that's why it's so cool. I think that DM was experimenting on this album with some stuff, but the result is fantastic!! I absolutely cannot get enough of the &quot;Never Let Me Down Again&quot; remix because the beat is so...so big and in your face, and oh my gosh it's just such an intese, dancy song! <BR>I also really like &quot;The Things You Said&quot; because it's slow and pensive and quiet. &quot;Strangelove&quot; is also terrific (especially the end...you'll see if you get this CD!); &quot;I Want You Now&quot; is just flat-out provocative and daring (another cool song, great for listening to with the one you love, hehe...); &quot;To Have and to Hold&quot; is dreary and depressing, yes, but oh-so-powerful. I love the mutterings in German at the beginning too, and when the beat comes in it sounds angry, determined. A definite favorite of mine. &quot;To Have and to Hold&quot; sort of melts into the perky &quot;Nothing&quot; which is a totally ironic song. It's all about how life is full of, well, nothing, but Dave sounds so light and casual when he sings it. The rest is a blend of strange, wonderful melodies and sounds that are what make DM so loveable and original.<BR>&quot;Music for the Masses&quot; has something for everyone on it. It will inspire and stimulate you, make you happy or pensive; all in all, it's just terrific.
6305897786|5.0|The promotions for this film made it out to be a fast-paced, rock video devil hunter yarn.  Instead, it is has a relaxing pace and a fairly quiet tone while still keeping the audience on their toes.<br />The biggest complaints about this film always come from the MTV generation.  If you want more action and demon-fighting, watch Spawn or End of Days.  I actually enjoyed those two, but that's another story.  There are always those who complain about films that don't take off as soon as they begin and last more than 1 1/2 hours.  Here's my advice to them: just sit still and pay attention for Christ's sake.<br />I always love a break from the pure, fair-haired, boyish hero type.  The Ninth Gate gives the audience a protagonist that some may dislike, but grow to like him as he actually becomes an even worse person during the film's progress.  No actor on this earth could have portrayed Dean Corso better than Johnny Depp.  The gifted Depp seamlessly blends sarcasm, violence, style, and charm into the mercenary book detective.<br />Corso's ally (Emmanuelle Seigner) appears in the form of a beautiful but plainly dressed wandering college student with supernatural powers.  With time, she proves herself to be a trustworthy protector and a perfect match for Corso.  Seigner's performance is comparable to Depp's, as her character's personality parallels Corso's to a certain degree.<br />Frank Langella is also noteworthy of his portrayal of business tycoon Boris Balkan.  Langella lends a strictly professional and calm attitude to his character, but also gives him a hint of eccentricity and a cold, forbidding, and dangerous side that Corso crosses midway through the film.  <br />The plot is very original and only grows greater with a well-written script and an eerie, beautiful soundtrack.  The acting is superb, as already described.  The special effects are masterfully done.  Most do not understand the film's finale, and the commentary by Polanski makes it clear that he desires it to remain a mystery.  In a nutshell, though, the image of Corso walking toward the castle suggests that his adventure is just beginning and he is entering even more dangerous territory than before.  Corso's &quot;angel&quot; even tells him near the end that the game is over for Balkan, but not for him.<br />In conclusion, this film is incredible and highly recommended to those who enjoy a leisurely paced thriller.
B00005TT77|5.0|Over the years many artists--talented or not--have tried to cover the Beatles, with very little success. I'd come to the conclusion that the Beatles just couldn't be improved or even changed. This CD has altered my opinion, and I'm happy for that. While I won't say that the tracks here are better or worse than the originals, they are certainly beautiful renditions.<BR>Of the 17 tracks:<BR>Two I don't like--Rufus Wainwright's &quot;Across the Universe&quot; and Nick Cave's &quot;Let It Be.&quot; <BR>Three are interesting, but not anything special--Black Crowes' &quot;Strawberry Fields,&quot; Grandaddy's &quot;Revolution,&quot; and Chocolate Genius's &quot;Julia.&quot;<BR>The remaining twelve songs are truly amazing, because they are more than just copycats. They are unique and exceedingly evocative, but sill adhere to the spirit and quality of the originals.<BR>The other thing that should be mentioned here is the song selection. They all have similar tempos and stylings which makes for a very even paced, cohesive compilation.
B00005631D|5.0|All tracks on this album are fantastic!  This album is truly one of the innovators of the jazz fusion genre.  First time I listened to this was back in the 70s in vinyl.  My uncle introduced me to it and from then on, jazz has been my favorite type of music.  The CD format is very hard to come by.  I had to wait more than a month before I finally received it.  Well worth the higher than average price of a CD.  Truly a must for any collector!!
B000007O9L|5.0|One of my favorite Stones CD's. I have a twelve disk changer and this one does not stay out of the car long.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|this movie was absolutely horrible...it made no sense and was just too weird...i mean, c'mon, they were singing madonna and nirvana songs in 1899??? nah.
B00005QXDD|4.0|A little subtlety would make this epic. Timing and delivery are great. This is one of the best parodies ever.  Long live The 'D'
B0000022WA|5.0|The Parent Trap starring Hayley Mills, Maureen O'Hara and Brian Keith is one of my favorite Disney movies and probably my favorite of Hayley Mill's movies and this movie proves that a good Disney movie doesn't always have to be a cartoon! I think this is such a sweet charming movie and I highly recommend it!
0618002251|2.0|So you've just seen the film and you absolutely can't wait for the next cinematic installment so you buy the book in the hope of quenching your curiosity. Naive consumer I blame you not. But before you purchase the book consider this. Obviously theres lots and lots of pages to this work so first ask yourself- is this something I'm really interested in persuing? Am I ready for this level of commitment in my life? Secondly theres literally hundreds of charcters in this work which in itself requires a superlative mnemonic feat on part of the reader. Then there's those numerous prolonged descrpitive passages which do very little to move the story along and are such a tremendous bore. And those maps? All rather silly and contrived really. Their inclusion in the novel, far from enhancing the story, is quite distracting and only makes the reader self conscious of the fact that they're reading a work of fiction. Kudos to old Tolky though for writing what is basically a sound storyline even if his ambition ultimately exceeded his ability to realize it. Person who will enevitably click &quot;not helpful&quot; button I have but two words for you- Mervyn Peake (he did the whole fantasy schtick soooo much better).
6302869390|5.0|This is a great memoir about George Harrison.  This was the greatest thing he's ever done.  I wish it would come out on dvd.  I miss George Harrison very much and also John Lennon.
B00005NW02|4.0|I must correct myself from the last review I wrote of this item, sorry to the masses for the mistake I made.  I obviously learned my lesson to research my ideas before letting them loose on the population.  well, everything I said still stands, but I now know that Daron Malakian is the guitarist, and has been ever since Soil, I apologize for my remarks on how bad he is, but I still think that he is trying too hard to be noticed, I noticed his name as an interruption rather than a member of the band.  sorry everyone, I will not make that mistake again.  good album, I'm liking it even more.
B000002UDB|5.0|Frankly , I've read some of the tepid and negative reviews on this site about this album/cd and have to counter them. NOBODY was producing the quality and innovation coupled with the fact that it was still radio worthy pop music, like the Beatles were and also true with this one. I think it was Engleburt Humperdink's (sp ... whatever!) &quot;Release Me&quot; that kept &quot;Stawberry Fields&quot; from going number one on the charts. If that's an indication of the taste of the rest of the country at the time and the competition... I rest my case. It's not a sound track album. It's not intended to be. It is a collection of songs put on an album just like all the other ones were at the time and basically still are. So what's wrong with that? All the songs stand on their own very nicely , thank you. If you don't particularly like the Beatles then why are you here? This album is a TREASURE! It has been VERY influential to many artists and I hear it's influence to this day on the radio by current artists. When I first heard the initial releases from it way back when I have to admit it sounded differant than anything out at the time. Again the Beatles had decended from the clouds to lay a new layer of possibilities on top of pop music. <BR>This album was released in America alone and in the UK they released a smaller version called an EP (extended play). The American release (and the UK) had a nice booklet inside full of silliness about the Magical Mystery Tour and it's inhabitants. It was really a lot for the money. The kind of thing you don't see anymore. I don't recall a &quot;weak&quot; song on this album. I like &quot;Flying&quot; for what it is, a little instrumental song (well, some la, la's too) break and a segue to the next song really. I like that it is unique in that it's writing credits go to all the Beatles (I think that is unique in Beatldom). &quot;You're Mother Should Know&quot; isn't an acid rock song, or a heavey metal, or a ... I don't know what it is...it's just a GOOD song. I like it. It's well done. <BR>&quot;Penny Lane&quot;, &quot;I Am The Walrus&quot;, &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot;, are just classics hands down. I can't think of a reason to pan any of the Beatles scant releases during the decade of the 60's except that is unless you really never really were and are not really now.. a fan of the Beatles music. (But then I'd like to know what the heck you DID think was great at the time?) If you're young and looking to discover some of the music by the Beatles that isn't played to death already on the oldies radio stations you will find some jewels on this CD. &quot;Baby You're a Rich Man&quot;, &quot;Fool On The Hill&quot;, &quot;Blue Jay Way&quot; more... This CD shows the Beatles expanding and experimenting in the studio. Their techniques were way ahead of what was going on everywhere else at the time. Alan Parsons and Pink Floyd and others were .. listening and learning. It's something to remember that the Beatles went their own way here and OTHERS followed where they went.. not the other way around. 6 STARS
B00005R87Q|1.0|What is wrong with Hollywood? This movie coupled with 'Driven' have come to represent some of the most offensive filmaking ever. Where can you start...this is not \\"Plan Nine from Outer Space\\" bad...it's bad BAD. REAL BAD. <BR>Let's take the lighting for example. Every shot tries so hard to be glossy perfect. There are no blemishes. The cars always sparkle. The muscles of the meathead actors emphasized too much. In no way does that portray the grit and grime of the streets to any extent. It's like mall parking lot racing.<BR>The plot is crud. It was crud when it was \\"Point Break\\". By the way who wrote this dialogue? Who in the world TALKS like this? Are you people that liked it that oblivious to the language that is used here?  <BR>I wonder if the jounalist who stumbled onto this \\"new\\" world, has ever looked into the '50s drag racing scene. That's pretty much all this was. No earth-shaking thing here... In fact isn't the NHRA based out of California?<BR>The editing must've been done by a production assistant because anyone with any storytelling knowledge wouldn't have let ANY of these scenes on to the final print.<BR>The MOST offensive aspect is that it panders to a dumb audience, so that more of this drivel, \\"fast-food\\" movie making can be served up to you the [person] who keeps getting suckered by 500 :30 spots an hour on MTV.
B0000508U6|5.0|Long ago, when the world was young, a group named Radiohead gave people in the US a glimpse of what their British cousins had been doing since the Beatles broke up. Now, Coldplay is ready to show us more. &quot;Parachutes&quot; is what I believe to be the best album of 2001 (or 2000, or whenever).<br />With the electric guitars and haunting piano melodies, Coldplay takes the genre mastered by Radiohead and Travis and gives it new melodies, quite possibly more ambient and etheral than anything those other two acts have done. Don't get me wrong, though. Radiohead and Travis are two other wonderful British acts. It's just that in the case of Coldplay, to be so good at making music on a debut album is an achievement unto itself.<br />I mean, take the gorgeous &quot;Trouble&quot;. Its masterful piano strokes and wandering lyrics would make it the highlight of the album. The problem is that every song is as good as this one, if not better. From the chorus of &quot;We live in a beautiful world&quot; on &quot;Don't Panic&quot; to the guitar/piano duet that is &quot;Everything is Not Lost&quot;, &quot;Parachutes&quot; is a satisfying album that will leave you speechless.<br />The only problem is the albums length. 10 tracks...and the title track is, humorously, only forty seconds long. I have come up with a neat solution, though. Rip a friend's copy onto your computer, download some of their extra tracks like &quot;Careful Where You Stand&quot; and &quot;See You Soon&quot;, stick them at the end of the album as hidden tracks and then burn it onto a CD-R. Just an opinion...
B00005B36H|4.0|I  have had Aenima sitting on my shelf for some time now, without much play. I never considered picking up Lateralus until I saw Tool perform live in San Antonio a few months back. The sound was great, and I admire the attention and focus that this band gives to thier music. I like the free feel that the music has, which keeps your ears and mind from anticpating the whole song within the first thirty seconds. It is amazing how tool pieces their music together. I am only an intermediate guitar player, but  I can pick out this guys riffs in a few minuites, as well as the bass. Once it is put together, though, it sounds huge. The ace in the hole is the drummer. Without a great drummer, this band is dead. I admire his ablility to incorportate his whole kit, and  full use of the toms. No disco or urban beats here. Solid drumming that will outlast current trends. I am a new listener to tool, but  I feel that Lateralus is a better album with far better production. It is more clear and concise. I would have given this album five stars, but I will not. Tool fancies themselves as artists. Take your music seriously, but not yourselves.
B000001EUR|4.0|Maybe this was the last great Scorpions album, and their bestseller, for sure. After openly approaching a more commercial direction when guitarrist Ulrich Roth was replaced by Matthias Jabs, Scorpions finnally perfeceted their own formula of AOR metal, hitting the stride at last with BLACKOUT, and then making an even more succesfull album in LOVE AT FIRST STING. The CD is really good, altough Herman Rarebell drumming sounds flat, uninspired, dead and robotic. The nine tracks are strong, altough I agree with one reviewer that said that THE SAME THRILL is below the others. Anyway, the good ballad STILL LOVING YOU pointed the way the band was going, without turning back: pop-metal with love cliches.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|''The Best [Darn} Movie'' in the world.This movie is better than littie nicky.
B000002KIT|5.0|I would say nothing. Lynott, Robertson, Gorham and Downey at their peak. A little overdub for perfection's sake, then you have one of the best live albuns ever. Enough said.
B00005OCMR|5.0|TRON remains timeless because it (along with the early 80's video game technology it is based on) doesn't operate within the bounds of photorealism - consequently, its surrealistic look &amp; style don't have to compete with the ever-evolving computer graphics that are quickly becoming impossible to discern from reality. This Anniversary Edition manages to &quot;fix&quot; the only problem I've ever had with this film : the cheesy synthesizer musical score has been eliminated...HOORAY !
B00005QXDD|5.0|If you like Adam Sandler (I do) then Tenacious D will be a huge step up. The songs sound thought out, instead of just the first three chords they could think of, like Sandler. Don't get me wrong, Adam Sandler is funny, but The D is just better in the musical department.
B000003TA4|4.0|Though there's no denying its cultural impact, this CD is highly overrated as a rock album, as Nirvana were overrated as a band and Kurt Cobain as a musician. While Nirvana are usually seen as the leaders of the Seattle grunge scene, they were not the best grunge band around; both Pearl Jam and Soundgarden (who also preceded them as the first band to come up with the grunge sound) were both more sophisticated in their playing and compositions. Instrumentally, Nirvana were very restricted, not only because of their challenging three-man lineup (with which some incredible things were done before - note Cream, the Police and Rush) but also because of the bandmates' limited instrumental abilities, most notably Kurt Cobain's powerful but very simplistic guitar (note his obvious, pointless solos especially). Dave Grohl's drumming is solid but banal. Bass player Chris Novoselic is the only member of the band with a recognizable playing style, but while his bass-lines are quite powerful and memorable they are also sometimes annoying.<br />But Nirvana's biggest failing is also their biggest strenghth; the simplicity of their sound makes Nirvana's music extremely powerful, and what Kurt didn't have as a musician he made up for in charisma and showmanship. Cobain's weary, angry, nasal voice was the voice of a generation, and it put into words the feelings of that generation. That's what made Smells Like Teen Spirit such a huge hit, and so important and groundbreaking. It's beacause of Kurt's personality that Nirvana had a much bigger following than Soundgarden could have ever had. It's their simplicity and straightforwardness that was groundbreaking and turned this album into a classic.<br />Listening now, ten years later, it's difficult to be impressed by Nirvana's original sound, since it was copied so many times before; and when appreciated in a vacuum, as a music album and not in its historical context, it's really not that breathtaking, certainly not as good as Ten or Superunknown. As good as Smells Like Teen Spirit is (and it is, it really is), some of the other songs sound a bit too much like it, and the whole thing becomes a bit dull after a while. I rarely listen to the entire CD from beginning to end; there are several songs on the album which are truly excellent, my favorites being, besides Smells Like Teen Spirit and the equally good Lithium (I just love the bass here), In Bloom (Kurt's only great guitar solo), Something In The Way (the beautiful cello sound adds a lot), On A Plain (note the beautiful ending, as everything fades out except for the backing vocals) and the bone-chilling minimalistic Polly, a frightfuly effective song. Several other songs, though, I find skippable, namely Come As You Are (boring, obvious, overrated, annoying bass-line), Territorial Pissings (noise) and Drain You (just plain boring).<br />In case I haven't made myself clear, I don't think Nirvana were a bad group. Nevermind is an extremely powerful album, even if not as it was ten years ago. It's obviously an absolute essential in every well-balanced collection, if not as a rock album then as a cultural artifact. It should be on your shelf even if you won't listen to it more than once. But try an album by another grunge album (I recommend Pearl Jam's 'Ten') because grunge made some good music, and it doesn't all come down to Smells Like Teen Spirit. If you want to hear Nirvana at their musical best, though, try their MTV unplugged live show (Kurt shows surprisingly good control of an acoustic guitar, even if not as inspiring as that of a master like Clapton), which shows a  softer, more sombre, more mature Nirvana, and also includes their versions of selected classics (most notably their excellent version of Bowie's 'Man Who Sold The World') and not only Cobain songs, which tend to get boring after a while. Still, for the phenomena that is Nirvana, Nevermind is the no. 1 essential.
B00005RFQ5|4.0|I have listened to the majority of Prince's catalouge since &quot;For You&quot;; The Rainbow Children is simple the end to the Sex Drugs &amp; Rock n Roll...here we a have record have great significance but undermined by the man behind it...Prince = Sex...nothing else, nothing more in the eyes of the world...and he simple can't shake that LoveSexy/WecanFunk/EroticCity/LubricatedLady image...and why should he?  Anyway give TRC a try...if your in mid 20's - 40's and trying to fill the void in your life...Prince will provide you with the new translationz...of the modern day biblical code.
B00005LMBK|5.0|THis CD is one of the most abstract and best cd's i've gotten in a while. Each song I've listened to is different, so if you don't like Clint Eastwood or 19-2000, don't judge the whole album by those 2 songs. 5/4 (Track 2) is a really good song. Not like the other 2.<br />PS: Does anyone know what they really look like?<BR>There are no pics in the booklet, and all the videos are cartoons.
0064431789|5.0|One book on the list of books every child, in every country, should be familiar with.  As a mother, a grandmother and a teacher I can verify the popularity of this book as well as the on-going memories of the pictures and the text. A book for generations of children and their parents, grandparents and teachers.  Unforgettable.
B00005OM4N|4.0|No Im not one of those teeny-boppers or anything but I went over a friends house n so we jus listened to the CD. I bought the first n 2nd CD n I hated them. But this CD is totally diffrent. And half the people that really hate her only because they like to diss pop or just hardly have taste. Im really into all diffrent musics but Im surprised I found this CD to a liking. One of the 5 good songs are &quot;Im a Slave 4 u&quot; &quot;Not a girl not yet a woman&quot; &quot;Cinderella&quot; &quot;Boys&quot; and &quot;I love Rock n'Roll&quot; So I would recommend this CD!
0156012197|5.0|I, having loved The Little Prince for several years now, will not attempt to put into words how I feel about this book nor the amazing respect I have towards its creator.  Anyone who loves The Little Prince as I do will understand my silence. I do however have some things to say about the translation of Mr. Richard Howard.<br />     Having read The Little Prince in its original French version I was astounded by the inconsistencies of the previous standard English translation by Ms Katherine Woods.  She reconstructed many sentences and used the words \\"child\\" and \\"little man\\" interchangeably and the error that angered me most: Ms Woods completely eliminated the sentence [...] from the description of the repeated landscape.<br />     As readers of the English language we all can agree that \\"Time soothes all sorrows\\" hits harder than \\"Everyone eventually is consoled.\\"  But no one can deny that the later is a more precise translation [....]  One may find Ms Woods' version more poetic, but it lacks the authenticity of Mr. Howard's.  <br />     I encourage all readers of Ms. Woods' translation to pick up a copy of Mr. Howard's.  It will anger you, I guarantee it.  The words that comforted you for years, the lines that seemed to change your life, no longer exist in this novel.  But if we truly want to love The Little Prince in the way Antoine de Saint-Exupéry envisioned him (without taking the time to learn the French language) we must open ourselves up to this, in my opinion, much better translation.
B0000024Z7|5.0|I bought this album when it first came out and have always respected this album as Carlos's best sound of guitar and percussion.  He wails and so does the percussion; particularly on &quot;Every Step of the Way.&quot;  I wore this groove out on my orignal album in the days of vinyl.  The album has a mystical, spiritual flavor to it in lyrics and instrumental.  The album flows and it got little or no air time, but the sound is outstanding.  Worth letting yourself surrender to the music!
B00005U2LM|4.0|This album is so much better than \\"The W\\" <BR>I'm an avid Wu fan...I have been satisfied as well as let down...and lately I have been about to give up on the Wu...especially after Cappadonna's \\"The Yin and the Yang\\" WTF was that??? The Pillage was good...anyway...<BR>I wasn't let down by \\"The Iron Flag\\" and that's a breath of fresh air...it's not even near touching 36 Chambers...but none have and none will. Don't get me wrong, I love the Wu so much...but I'm just tryin to express how they have been kinda dissapointing lately...but this album didn't dissapoint me...that's my point...this album is good. Maybe the Wu aint dead yet...praise the lord, cuz I am not about to deal with this commercial smack runnin the music world.
630575067X|2.0|If special effects could save a film this might have been interesting. The music, cinematography, and scenery are all excellent. Unfortunately the young Jake Lloyd &quot;Anakin Skywalker&quot; is no Haley Joel Osment. He has the look but no substance, I couldn't wait for him to get off the screen. Jar Jar... needed to be reigned in a bit. I was expecting a lot from this movie. The story is very weak and this was a waste of a good cast. I doubt if I will play the DVD more than once.
0743420373|3.0|What the authors say is that we can all be millionaires if we would only stop spending. But can we? Surely if everyone behaved like this the economy would grind to a halt, and no one would get rich. And the Scots are frugal? Their economy never seems to grow like England's, and always seems to have more unemployment. Any link?

B00005QJDG|5.0|If you have the least bit of interest in Dream Theater or prog rock buy this album.  Dream Theater plays through their entire 'Scenes from a Memory' album, as well as 'A Change of Seasons' and many other great DT songs.  John Petrucci, Jordan Rudess, Mike Portnoy, and John Myung are smokin' on this album, and James LaBrie isn't half bad either.  All in all, if you are looking for a starting album for Dream Theater this is it.
0688170528|1.0|I read this book twice just to make sure i didn't miss anything the first time.  It kept me coming back to see what the characters would do next!
6305252521|5.0|This is simply an excellent film overall, with a surprisingly touching and underrated love component thrown in.  However, the most underrated aspect of the film is Jim Carrey's incredible performance.  I'll put it bluntly and very seriously: for Carrey not to have won a Best Actor Oscar for his work in this film was a complete injustice (although not a surprise whatsoever to anyone familiar with the Academy).  He was robbed.
B00004Z459|3.0|Limkin Park iz a really good band that isn't trying to copy Limp Bizkit or anyone else. I like Limp Bizkit and have his albums also. Come on why else would this be the top selling album of the year??? BUY IT!!!
0140185232|4.0|A synopsis is unnecessary with this many reviews. The immediate impression I had while immersed in this thought-provoking book was that I was reading what seemed like mere character essays of a circle of family members, friends and acquaintances. Only one of the character surveys, if you will, was truly worth reading about. The others were there simply to contrast the views, words and deeds of Larry Darrell. These experiences Larry had (as told to the author within the scope of the book) are extremely well conceived and passionately described. Larry's noble pursuit for ultimate truth and spiritual clarity places the conventional approaches to life (as chosen by his friends and former fiancee) in a perspective that is worth observing by anyone interested in the nature of Western culture and the patterns of the Western mind. <BR>  Uncle Elliot, Isabel, Gray Maturin and Sophie all appear to represent a wrong turn made by the human spirit that in modernity has perceived himself to be free. Larry symbolizes an unquenchable desire to turn back and find that fulfilling and peaceful path of pure consciousness and deliberate awareness that has been largeley eschewed by capitalist, democratic societies of the twentieth century. <BR>  On another level, I found Isabel and Sophie to be compelling characters. Elliot's portrayal was interesting only in comparison to that of Larry's (Elliot was basically a tedious individual who strived for empty modes of personal satisfaction). And could someone (Maugham's ghost is welcome to chime in) please help me to understand why Suzanne was included, even mentioned in this novel? I just finished the book a few days ago so her pretentious purpose in the story has yet to materialize for me. But acquainting myself with the captivating and fittingly incomplete persona of Larry Darrell was worth reading every word of this book.
0618164413|5.0|I absolutely loved Curious George when I was a child. It is so thrilling to watch that same excitement in my 3 y.o. daughter. She practically begs me to read her a story from the book every night. During the day, she loves to flip through the book looking for her favorite pictures. It's not often that children enjoy the same things that delighted their parents as children. I am so happy to able to share these stories with her!
B00003CXRM|5.0|The characters and dialog were to die for...The actors were skillful and intense...George Clooney and John Turturro (who I didn't recognize) and Tim Blake Nelson, who I didn't know, were all cast perfectly and blended together so well it seemed so easy for them and fun!   <br />Happy to see near the end they all decided to seek the treasure (within) and were saved by a &quot;miracle&quot;
B00005TT77|5.0|Ok, i just bought this album and heard it only twice and already i think it is so killer. Sometimes I have to hear an album more than a few times to really get into it. This album though, i loved first time around. Maybe it is because it is comprised of classic beatles songs that i have already heard and loved for years. I bought it for the Eddie Vedder track. I happen to LOVE Eddie and You've Got to Hide Your Love Away happens to be my most favorite Beatles song ever. I also am a big Sarah McLachlan fan and i am a fan of the song blackbird. So i went into this thinking i had two gold songs and instead I have found that the whole album is just better than ice cream. ;)<BR>If you are a big fan of 90's alternative pop, then i think you will love this album. It's fun and light and also filled with talented artists doing amazing songs. Liking the Beatles doesn't hurt either. I guess the combo of the songs chosen to be covered and the bands covering them...it's just a golden combo. I can't rave enough about each and every track on this soundtrack. It's a must own.
B00005QY5Y|2.0|I don't get the hype surrounding Adams. If I wanted to listen to this kind of music, I'd pull out my old Bob Dylan, Rolling Stones, Black Crowes....and a dozen other white man blues/rockabilly/R&amp;B albums. Nothing new here!
0812550706|4.0|Ender has become an entity in my class.  The book has become a phenom.  It's amazing, a definite page turner.  I finished it twice over one weekend.  Ender's game is almost impossible to put down.

B00005QY5Y|5.0|I was never real impressed with Whiskeytown, and thought his last one,'Heartbreaker,' was pretty good, but Ryan Adams has hit his stride with 'Gold.'<br />The opening line of `La Cienega' quotes Van Morrison, the guitar from `Gasoline Alley' plays in `Rescue Blues,' and `Stars Go Blue' has a lick from `Lady Jane.' Chock full of influences, which only enhance some original songwriting and a great voice. Best new, young artist in a long time.
0553106635|5.0|I've read a lot of books over time, this series is contending with the Wheel of time series in my honest opinion. After countless dissapointing books from terry goodkind, and other such authors starting off with good books but then giving out sad sequels in the rest of the series, George Martin has yet to dissapoint. I've believe I've finally found my niche. =P
6305364613|1.0|On the one hand, I applaud the risk taking in this cruel and creepy rendition of &quot;Romeo and Juliet.&quot; With movies being so commercially uniform and predictable these days, it is nice to see someone attempting to answer their own muse. Sadly, this particular adaptation of the play is really awful. In my view, Luhrman completely misses the soul and heart of the original. What a conundrum-- Bravo Boldness! Bravo Art! Boooo The Movie!
B00005ASHM|5.0|There's not much I can say about this album that hasn't been said millions of times before.  These compositions are simply amazing, and incredibly beautiful.  The vocal melodies, arrangements, lyrics, virtually every thing about this album is perfect.  For those familiar with the material (and who isn't familiar with at least some of it) but not familiar with this latest version, the new stereo mix is fantastic.  It makes great use of the stereo seperation, but without blatantly changing the sound of the songs.  Its the only version I listen to, but the original mono recording is included as well for purists.  <br />A note to detractors, and those making unfavorable comparisons to Sgt. Pepper:  Sgt. Pepper is an equally brilliant album, arguing which is 'better' is pointless.  Still, you naysayers would do well to consider that Pet Sounds was released a year earlier, and that The Beatles did Sgt. Pepper as a direct response to Pet Sounds in an attempt to top it, and they had a vast amount of money and the help of producer George Martin with which to do it.
B00005QDW1|5.0|....Or maybe its just me?  I liked Tragic Kingdom because it was fun, bouncy, and had good lyrics.  Return Of the Saturn was really in depth with great lyrics but all Gwen did was whine and ....it just brought you down.  But Rock Steady still has the good lyrics, but No Doubt has crossed into techno beats and a little electronica stuff.  True there are no huge guitar riffsand huge huge drum beats like the previous two albums but Rock Steady is still a good album.  Gwen's voice doesn't sound as whiny as Return of Saturn and No Doubt sounds more polished all around.  I feel that by exploring different sounds in music, it proves that No Doubt is improving as a group.  So don't give this cd a bad rating just because it isn't as &quot;rock, ska&quot; infused as their previous albums.  Basically if you like &quot;Hey Baby&quot; then you should get the cd.  Because Rock Steady is as different sounding as &quot;Hey Baby&quot;.
B0000542D1|4.0|This movie was really great!  They are so goofy and funny and the music is great!  Deffinitely a keeper!
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney Spears (excuse my pun) has done it once again, in a whole new way. With help from some new faces like The Neptunes (Mystikal's \\"Shake Ya Ass\\", Fabolous \\"Youngin'(Holla Back)\\") Justin Timberlake (Nsync) and Wade Robson (choreographer) and Dido (she co-wrote \\"I'm Not A Girl...\\") her sound has transformed. But don't forget the oldies like Max Martin, Rodney Jerkins, and Rami. Plus, Britney cowrote 5 songs for herself, and popped up the classic song \\"I Love Rock N Roll\\". The best songs are as follows:<br />\\"Boys\\" - So funky and catchy all at once you'll be sucked right in<BR>\\"Lonely\\" - Also very funky, but has a very rock guitar in the background<BR>\\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" - How can you not love it??<BR>\\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\" - Ok, its not the greatest song, but you can finally really hear her voice, so there all you haters!<BR>\\"What It's Like To Be Me\\" - The chorus is catchy as hell and Justin's beatbox gives the song a perfect finishing touch<br />The albums only mishap:<br />\\"That's Where You Take Me\\" - The music-box music does not blend with the opening of moaning ..... It's catchy all the same, but i wouldn't want that coming out of a childs toy

B000059TPN|4.0|In Michael Bay's action film &quot;The Rock,&quot; a disgruntled retired Marine general takes hold of top secret biological weapons in an attack on the United States government's ignorance of its fallen soldiers. If this sounds contrived to you, trust me, you're in the right territory. Almost every aspect of this film is bogus, unbelievable in its logic, but here's the good part: it never really matters. <br />With producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Bay at the helm of the project, &quot;The Rock&quot; whips its ludicrous story into shape with the very adept use of special effects, a witty and serviceable script, and a trio of lead actors who bring it all to life with a combination of zest, charm, and supercharged intensity. It's got the guts, the ammo, and the brains to make us forget about its story holes and pay attention to the thrill of everything going on before our eyes, and man, it never stops moving. <br />The action begins when U.S. Marine general Frank Hummel (Ed Harris) uses his military status to penetrate a high-security armory and lift dangerous biochemical warfare missiles. Once in possession of the weapons and a crew of devoted Marines, Hummel makes his way to Alcatraz, where he takes a group of eighty-one tourists hostage in a revenge plot against the American government for their refusal to grant compensation to the families of his men who died in Operation Desert Storm. His terms: a delivery of $100 million to be divided among the families of those who lost loved ones, or the missiles are to be launched into the heart of San Francisco. <br />Hummel's knowledge of military intelligence is baffling to the FBI, who agree to his order for compensation while secretly devising a plan of catching the band of Marines offguard. To do this, they call in Dr. Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage), an expert in biochemical weapons whose main objective is to diffuse the missiles on the island. Leading the team of soldiers is convict John Mason (Sean Connery), whose imprisonment and escape from Alcatraz decades before is vital to their successful entry into the now-defunct facility. <br />Mind you, this is not one of the most intelligent thrillers ever made; there are illogical occurrences and events that are not to be believed as realistic. Hummel's ease in attaining his arsenal is one such point: if these missiles are as dangerous as everyone keeps saying, then the security surrounding them would be triple the amount of what the movie portrays. Also unclear is the way in which Hummel and his men bring their weapons to the island, and it's also very unlikely that a trio of helicopters could land on the island without so much as a questioning eye from civilians of San Francisco, who are never made aware of the threat that awaits them. <br />These elements aside, this is a movie that is jam-packed with action, one of the finer examples of a thriller in years. Any inhibitions (and they are few) give way to tense sequences of explosions, exchanges of gunfire, and the race-against-time factor as the deadline begins to reach its completion. Bay knows just how to work his audience into a frenzy of suspense, with tightly-knit scenes of incredible energy and pacing that keeps the movie at a feverpitch. He keeps these scenes coming one after another while also working them into the sequence of events, so that they have a purpose rather than just being there for show. <br />The terrific casting of Cage against type and Connery in one of his best modern roles is another one of the movie's assets, to say nothing of the brilliant performance handed in by Harris. Harris is able to portray Hummel as more than just a one-dimensional character; as the time draws closer to the launching of the missiles, we can see him becoming more frantic and unstable. Cage is supremely funny as Goodspeed, who has no knowledge of combat; when crossed with Connery's performance as Mason, who is a self-proclaimed escape artist, the result is some of the wittiest and sharpest humor in an action movie to date. <br />&quot;The Rock&quot; isn't stellar moviemaking, but its grand entertainment with a very nice touch from its cast and crew. The acting zeal adds greatly to the softening of what could have become a serious, and seriously boring, action film, while the scenes of action themselves are charged with incredible energy that results in nothing less than sheer excitement.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I found this movie refreshingly funny.  The type of movie you can and want to watch over and over again.  A must to own.
B00001ODHJ|5.0|Often referred to as &quot;The Three Stooges vs. The Evil Dead&quot;. This is the third and hopefully not the final installment in the Evil Dead Trilogy. We find our hero Ash (Bruce Campbell) sucked into a vortex which sends him back in time to 1300 AD. The Wiseman John knows that Ash is the one written about in the Necronomicom , &quot;he who is sent back to deliver them from the evil deadites&quot;. But King Arthur suspects he's one of  Henry the Red's men.<br />After doing battle in the pit, we get a glimpse of Ash's sensitive side. He is able to strike a &quot;deal&quot; with Arthur that if he retrieves the book, they will send him back to his own time. He is instructed that he must say three little words before retrieving the book. If said wrong....he would release the Army of Dead. <br />While traveling to retrieving the book, he has a little run-in with his evil side. When he finally happens upon the book, he tries to say the words right, really. But, as you can probably surmise from the title, the dead march. Along the way, Ash must do battle with his possessed medieval girlfriend, the Army of Dead, and even himself (as Evil Ash and little Ashes). The end battle scene is a laugh a minute. Complete the trilogy, buy this movie.
0783222475|5.0|We love this movie so much, we have two copies. We don't get tired of watching Pierce Brosnan defy the laws of nature, and the heroic efforts of the Grandma who jumps in to the acid soaked lake to pull her grandchildren to safety, only to have her legs melt away to nothing! We loved it, we want to see it again, and again, and again.
6305095442|5.0|The movie begins with our hero, Ash (Bruce Campbell), having survived his hellish night of battling the evil dead. Ah, morning's here, time to escape. Wrong! Just as Ash is preparing to leave, the last remaining demonic spirits rocket him through the woods in a very comical scene. Crashing into a tree, Ash regains consciousness only to be possessed by the evil dead, but eventually the morning light chases these spirits away, sparing our hero. <br /> Ash then falls unconscious, only to awake as dusk is setting in. . . . ROUND 2. During the ensuing night, Ash battles his dead girlfriend, his own hand (which he lops off with a chainsaw), and more evil dead than you can shake a shotgun at. They are looking for fresh souls. Who can stop these little bastards? I won't tell-but as you can see, there is a sequel.
B000003BF4|5.0|Three words: Honky Tonk Women.  The live version of this song was actually the first that I heard--I put this record on my parents' phonograph and lost my breath when I heard the first chord of that song.  The studio version just doesn't compare--it's too upbeat and lacks the raw sonic groove found on this version.  &quot;Honky Tonk Women&quot; is not meant to be an upbeat song; I love feeling each chord, a feeling I just don't get on the studio cut.  I'm also partial to the second verse that Mick sings in the live version; &quot;strollin' on the boulevards of Paris, as naked as the day that I will die&quot; just exudes rock poetry.  The rest of the album is uniformly excellent--you really feel like you're at a 'Stones concert, with Mick asking the crowd whether they want to see his trousers fall down after the opening &quot;Jumpin' Jack Flash.&quot;  I do agree that the studio version of &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; is better than the live version present here, but this version of the song is definitely worth listening to.  While I'll have to listen to that Allman Brothers album, for now this is the best live album I've ever heard and certainly one of the very best albums in general.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|The story is a simple one. Five college students venture into the wooded mountains of Tennessee to spend a weekend of fun in an isolated cabin. Is this your standard weekend of sex, drugs, and rock n' roll? No...unfortunately, our heroes find the \\"Book of the Dead\\", play a tape recording of demonic incantations, and unknowingly open a portal to the netherworld. <br />The \\"Book of the Dead\\", bound in human flesh and inked in human blood, contains the ancient rituals that cause the spirits of evil to awaken and possess, one by one, the poor innocent students. As the survivors see their friends and loved ones transformed into hideous, murdering demons, they learn that the only way to kill the possessed is to dismember their bodies. <br />Who will be next possessed by the evil dead? Will anyone survive this night of terror? I won't tell. Buy this movie, you won't regret it!... The Greatest Horror Movie of All Time!...
0780020685|5.0|I had always heard about Seven Samurai, and what a great movie it is. For whatever reason, I never saw it until recently. The only word to describe it would be &quot;masterpiece.&quot; It works on so many different levels, and explores so many different themes, that the viewer becomes completely absorbed throughout it's 3 and a half hour run time. Director Akira Kurosawa has long been hailed as a genious, and here's the proof. It's hard to find any fault anywhere in this picture. It's absolutely perfect from it's groundbreaking cinematography, to the ensemble acting, to the the intense action sequences. I love the way Kurwosawa uses the elements like wind and rain to intensify the power of a scene.<BR>The story itself is classic, and is the basic storyline of many American westerns, including &quot;The Magnifficent Seven,&quot; which is a remake of this film. In 16th century Japan, a poor farming village besieged by bandits, hire seven samurai warriors to protect them. For merely a handful of rice a day, the seven men agree to help the villagers. We meet each samurai one by one, and learn of their personality traits and their various reasons for joining up. As the leader of a stellar cast is the legendary Toshiro Mifune, who plays Kikuchiyo, an orphaned peasant pretending to be a samurai as he searches for revenge.<BR>Some viewers might shy away from the movie because of the subtitles. The themes this film deals with, like comedy, trajedy, and action are all themes that transcend the language barrior, and this movie should not be missed because of it. Every scene counts, every battle more spectacular than the last, and every performance is right on target.<BR>The DVD is an exceptional restored version of the 1956 epic, with pretty good sound. Also features a pretty interesting commentary by film expert Michael Jeck. Don't miss this one!
B00000IMCW|5.0|The story begins with a continuation of the theme from &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;: the dead have arisen and are now stalking the living. Four strangers, fleeing in a helicopter, head north looking to escape this horror. Running low on fuel, they happen on one of America's social enigmas; the shopping mall. One problem , zombies seem to like the mall too. After cleaning out the deadbeat shoppers in their new home, our heroes are about to begin to live the life of luxury, right? . . .  WRONG! Unfortunately someone else has their eyes on this prize:a gang of looters led by bad-boy, Tom Savini. <br />This movie is a basic requirement for the completion of your horror degree, without it your grade is &quot;I&quot; as in incomplete. Don't flunk out of Horror U. See &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; and receive your degree in zombie-ology.
B00003CX8V|5.0|They just don't make movies like this any more. It's perfect in every way from the acting of the late great Jack Lemmon, to the writing/direction of Billy Wilder. Everything adds up to an immensely enjoyable movie, worthy of multiple viewings. <BR>Lemmon stars as C.C. Baxter, a worker drone employed by the nation's largest insurance corporation. In hopes of climbing the corporate ladder, C.C. lends his cozy little apartment to his bosses for entertaining their mistresses. Baxter's life as a bachelor seems empty, until doors begin to open up for him at work, and he begins pursuing lovely elevator operator Fran (Shirley MacLaine), who just happens to be the ex-mistress of his boss (Fred MacMurray) who would like to rekindle the romance with her himself. Baxter must decide what is more important: success or the woman he has fallen in love with. <BR>The movie features some hilarious situations, including Baxter's nosy neighbors, who think he's a real playboy judging by all the racket coming from his apartment every night. Again, the acting is splendid all around, from Lemmon to the beautiful MacLaine. You'll be hard pressed to find a movie as charming as this one. In beautiful black and white.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Though I was somewhat confused as to where it was going during the first 30 minutes of this film, I hung in there.  Boy, am I glad I did!  Wonderful performances, dramatic flair in costumes and props, soaring operatic musical scores telling the story of two lovers who should belong with each other, except for that nasty villan....  The newest and best of &quot;rock&quot; operas since &quot;Tommy.&quot;
0618077367|5.0|I discovered this story only a few years ago, but it is far and away my favourite christmas story. The illustrations are beautiful and the story never fails to make me cry - perhaps I'm soppy, or perhaps its just a great story.<br />Never stop believing.
0553106635|5.0|this book is a solid a+. The plot is perfectly meshed with the story. Mr. Martin does what so few writers of any gendre can do. After convincing you after several hundred pages that you know for sure whats white and whats black he changes your mind. Not in the classic style of pulling the rug out from under your feet,but building his characters to be more than 2 dimensional. He performs this feat with style and a skill thats pretty hard to find. He defintely is the king of anti-hero. Does the book answer every question posed in the first two books? nope. Who cares? not me .
B00005QHPQ|3.0|I purchased this CD for my wife. Although I am not a fan, I did decide to give it a listen and try to be unbiased. I was pleasantly surprised by what I heard. Sounding somewhat like Ace of Base (on some songs), the tunes were catchy and were enjoyable to listen to. That is until I got to track 11. It really bothers me when artists include re-mixes of songs that are already on the CD in another language. If Enrique wants to be a cross over artist, he should produce an English CD  for the North American audience and a Spanish CD for his Latin fans. Or at the very least include three songs that are not already on the CD in Spanish.
B0000020C4|3.0|This is an ok album, but I personally like the OLC and the CSR better. Colm Wilkinson is PHENOMINAL in this CD and Philip Quast is as well, although I personally prefer Michael McCarthy, who isn't on any CD as Javert, but who is the foreman in this CD.<BR>Ruthie Henshall isn't my favorite Fantine - she just doesn't convince me of being a mother, but it is to my understanding that she was sick the night of the performance, so maybe that had something to do with it. At least she looked the part. ALun Armstrong and Jenny Galloway are worth listening to and make a wonderful, comic pair, even though Barry James and Gay Soper of the CSR are slightly better. Michael Ball, is wonderful as Marius and Michael Miguire is a handsome, convincing Enjolras.<BR>Lea Salonga, however, could have been better - she was a bit<BR>too mean to be Eponine in my opinion. The chorus is wonderful, being made up of top London actors, and Judy Kuhn's Cosette is<BR>touching, her voice lovely as always. This isn't the best CD, but it certainly overrides the Broadway one! This is a great CD for new Les Mis fans - it was my first and it did teach me a lot about the play.
0446608955|5.0|This book is definately worth reading.  I would recommend it to all of you.  I read it all in one day because I just couldn't put it down.  Don't forget your box of tissues, you'll need them, but it will all be worth it in the end.
B00005A1VH|5.0|Sergeant York is the best movie of all times.  It shows the simple life of an American and what American values we use to have and would still like to have.  The story shows how a man became humble and came to believe in God.  It shows a love story with his family and girl friend. A man that was caught between good and evil.  How he struggled with right and wrong and the decision he made was perfect.  He had to kill to keep people from being killed in a war.  The language of the Kentucky hill people was great.  I enjoyed this movie over all other movies that I own.

B00003CXAA|5.0|This, along with Citizen Kane, in my opinion is the reason DVD players were made. Having all three of these movies along with one disc devoted entirely to extras is a treat in every sense of the word (Is there more than one? Oh well.).  This film, along with other great films on DVD (Jaws comes to mind), is finally getting the justice it deserves by being available in widescreen: the way the filmmaker intended.  You'll never want to watch it on cable again.<br />Of course we have a great story with great actors in a great looking film in the first Godfather. Who can forget the opening first shot as the camera slowly moves backward over Brando's right shoulder? On the extras disc we get an alternate opening to Part III that used a similar shot where Coppola wanted the camera to do the same thing over Pacino's shoulder while being asked an important favor by a Catholic bishop. However, he decided to scrap the opening, deciding that the focus should be on family, not business.  The film itself is great as we watch the daily goings-on of the Corleone family, the violence that can't be kept out, and the end of one Don and the rise of an unlikely other.<br />Part II is longer and also has a compelling story, but just isn't quite as good as the first. Don't get me wrong, it's a great film and I like it a lot, but the charm of the first film is lacking as we see Michael fully in charge and working with a ruthless efficiency to get what he wants.  By this time, the family has been forced out of New York (due to Michael's massive hit on the other families) and are controlling hotels and shady gambling operations in Las Vegas. One of the last scenes of the film, which is a flashback to earlier, happier days as the family is about to give a surprise party for Don Vito, is one of the best in film history. <br />Part III, which was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar in 1990, is still a pretty good film, and worthy contribution to the continuing story, although it's not quite up to the caliber of the other two.  Here we have Michael trying to keep the family operation in legitimate businesses only, but as fate would have it, every time he thinks he's out they pull him back in (sorry, I couldn't help myself). The final scene, which is supposed to echo Brando's death scene in the first film, doesn't quite work because it seems so short and rushed, almost as if Coppola was saying let's hurry and get this shot because we have to have it in the movie.<br />The extras disc is packed with quality stuff including a great &quot;making of&quot; documentary that pulls out all the stops. There's even a screen test of Martin Sheen reading for the part of Michael(!).  There's also Oscar acceptance speeches, an original 1971 featurette that was shot while the first Godfather was in production and many, many deleted scenes from each film, along with lots of other stuff.  Anyone building a serious DVD collection must have this. You won't be disappointed, unlike Michael with Fredo.
B00005TT77|5.0|This is the kind of album you want to take the time to listen to all the way through while wearing really great headphones - it's tender, personal and packed with details that might get overlooked if you were driving or otherwise engaged.<br />I've been a Beatles fan forever, so I was intrigued but prepared to be disappointed by covers.  I was pleasantly surprised to discover a beautifully conceived and delivered album.  Nearly every performer (except maybe Grandaddy with a tepid &quot;Revolution&quot;) manages to stay true to the Beatles' original while still adding a little something of themselves to the song, a testament to the strength of both the songwriters and the performers.<br />The album features an eclectic bunch, from the Black Crowes (with a trippy &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot;) to Paul Westerberg (lending new depth to &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; with his seen-it-all-but-still-hopeful time-worn voice).  It's especially nice to see lesser-known performers like Heather Nova and the Vines getting space here as well.  The common thread seems to be a genuine passion for the music - the inside cover of the CD jacket says simply &quot;all you need is love,&quot; and this album really does feel like a labor of love.  Most of the songs have a mellow, dreamy quality; listening is sort of like being wrapped up in a warm blanket.<br />Michael Penn (brother of &quot;I am Sam&quot; star Sean Penn) and his wife Aimee Mann start things off with a tender, Simon-and-Garfunkle-esque duet of &quot;Two of Us.&quot;  Sarah McLachlan's &quot;Blackbird&quot; is pretty but doesn't add much to the original, which is probably a good thing.  Rufus Wainright's &quot;Across the Universe&quot; - with its timely refrain of &quot;Nothing's gonna change my world&quot; - is passionate and plaintive.   <br />My favorite is the Wallflower's rendition of &quot;I'm Looking Through You,&quot; one of the more lively songs on the album, with jangly guitars and those familiar Beatles harmonies.  <br />Other standouts include Eddie Vedder bleeding his soul into a growling &quot;You've Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot; and Nick Cave closing out the album with a slightly darker take on &quot;Let It Be.&quot;<br />Overall, this album gave me a renewed appreciation for the Beatles' song-craft and the timeless ability of this deceptively simple music to reach deep into the soul.  It's also a chance to hear from some of today's top artists as well as brush up on some other great musicians who don't get as much mainstream exposure.
B000002GGW|5.0|This album, the first to be recorded without guitarist/vocalist Roger Hodgson stands out for a couple reasons:<br />1. It was a massive improvement on their previous album, &quot;Famous Last Words&quot;<br />2. It has a darker, jazzier sound than any of their other work. <br />Granted that most of their previous material had been largely upbeat, majoy key compositions, many die hard Supertramp fans simply don't know what to think of this, hence the bad reviews. But this is a brilliant album. Possibly one of the best released in the horrendous decade for music, the 80's.<br />4 of the six songs are dark, minor key and somewhat slow in tempo, except for the danceable, infectious &quot;Cannonball.&quot; The remaining two songs have a happier feel. The title track is very different for Supertramp, and the most progressive work they've done to date, alongside &quot;Fool's Overture.&quot; In terms of structure is it somewhat incohesive, but overall it has brilliant music moments in it that make it a true masterpiece, a standout in the bands repertoire.<br />The melancholy &quot;No Inbetween,&quot; is quite slow moving, but still holds your interest. &quot;Better Days&quot; is somewaht dramatic and emotional and has a cool jam thing in the end. &quot;Still in Love&quot; is more traditional Supertramp fare, with it's catchy sax lines and jumpy piano. &quot;Ever Open Door&quot; is sort of a slow, tender kind of song, and a nice warm way to close an album.<br />For people who aren't fans of change, skip this. For those who are, buy it for sure. The darker, piano-dominated sound is certainly a change, and definetly a welcome one. True, the loss of Hodgson is lamentable, but don't worry about it too much, because without him, Supertramp is alive and well.
B00005A1PR|5.0|Oh, I love this CD. On a particularly harsh, loveless day, I bought it &amp; the song &quot;Video&quot; turned me from a sniveling wretch to a smiling human in no time.  (&quot;Am I less of a lady if I don't wear pantyhose?/My mama said a lady ain't what she wears, but what she knows...&quot;)  The song &quot;Strength, Courage &amp; Wisdom&quot; is also a special delight.  This CD invites us to stop heeding society's advice to be shallow &amp; neurotic, but it also SOUNDS beautiful.  A lesser musician would make lyrics like these sound like some preachy feel-good thing, but India.Arie has a voice you can crawl into and live in for a good long time.
B00004Z459|5.0|I first heard of Linkin Park in late 2000, beofre they got huge and became overplayed. I got this cd right away, and instantly i loved it. I've been listining to it nonstop since then(wich is a long time) and i still love it. They have a genre like limp, but you cant even compare them. Linkin Park is sooooo much better it blows you away. Theyr rap/rock mixes are great(points of authority, cure for the itch), they have the best dj in the music industry, and it shows (cure for the itch, points of authority,), and some good kinda slow songs, too(by myself) anyways, linkni park is the best. if you like limp, well, lets jest say u wont like them for much longer. If you like system of a down, ull like this.<BR>     In the end, i admit is a little over played, but its still great. papercut is a great song. u kno wat, i wont bother to tell you how great they all arere. jest kno this: just becuz a hole bunch of posers like them, doesnt mean u shouldnt like them. this is great rock/ rap, and who cares is ppl like them, that means theyr good, rite? so go rite noe an buy this wonderful cd thats my favorite cd of all time
B00000ADG2|5.0|When this first came out, I was listening to a piece about Lauryn Hill on the radio and they played a clip of her song &quot;Everything is Everything.&quot; (&quot;Everything is everything/What is meant to be will be/After winter must come spring/Everything is everything.&quot;) I couldn't wait until I got off work that day to rush out &amp; buy it.  The zippy beat, her lush voice and clear enunciation, and the soothing lyrics that encourage you to hang on to the wild ride of life meant that this never left my tape deck until it started to sound crackly.  An especially beautiful piece that didn't get a lot of play is &quot;To Zion,&quot; a song to her son.  In it, she makes clear that she didn't intend to have a child then and that she was under pressure not to.  But then he was born and she was in love.  Although few people are in the situation of becoming a single mom vs. advancing a career as a famous singer, it is a paean to the unexpected love that can spring from the things we didn't expect.  What a beautiful person she is!  But we need another CD from her, right away!
0471413909|4.0|This is the best book on paleo nutrition since Ray Audette's Neanderthin.  It brings Audette's information up to date with science from this burgeoning area and will serve as an introduction to the only diet that is totally attuned to our physiology.  That's what's so neat about it.<br />But it is also what is so difficult for people to get their minds around.  As Robert Ingersoll said: \\"In nature there are neither rewards nor punishments, merely consequences\\" and we are inclined to regard our dietary preferences as matters of taste (in all senses), or even of ethics - as do vegetarians and those who point out that grain-based diets are far less demanding on the environment than meat-based diets such as those advocated by Dr Cordain.<br />But this misses the point.  Cordain is telling us what is natural, not what is ethical.  If a meat-based diet takes more land for each consumer than a grain-based diet, that is a consequence of human population numbers, it is not a reason for dismissing a paleo diet.<br />It also misses the point to say that, if we are to adopt a paleo diet, we should return to stone tools and a totally paleo life.  Cordain's thinking is clearer than this and the book has many stimulating ideas and insights about our evolutionary inheritance.<br />Cordain also tells us that the human species has barely altered since grains were first cultivated 10,000 years ago.  We are hunter-gatherer bodies in a post-industrial world.  Much of the book is devoted to explaining how diabetes, cardiovascular disease, food intolerances, osteoporosis, asthma, heartburn, Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome, constipation and many other modern diseases derive from the extent to which we have departed from the evolutionarily-proven lifestyle.  For this reason alone, this book deserves to be taken seriously.  As Ingersoll implies, there are natural consequences to our behaviour; our cultural preferences are irrelevant to the truth.<br />The author also contrasts modern activity levels with paleo activity levels and presents an exercise routine to complement his dietary advice.  <br />Dr Cordain devotes a part of the book to pointing out how meat, fish and fresh vegetables can be contaminated and he gives some guidance in avoiding such contaminated foods and whether the contamination levels are serious.<br />I'm a paleo eater and exerciser myself and I've been looking for a book like this for ages that I can pass to my friends to explain why I eat and exercise the way I do.  I bought two copies.  Great stuff!
0553801481|5.0|Okay, here's the dish. This is one GOOD book.<BR>I started out reading Robin Hobb's second trilogy, The live ship traders. After being thoroughly blown away, I read the Farseer trilogy. I found it to be completely unlike anything else I had ever read. She creates a world that isn't based on the great balance for good and evil, with the hero having no faults what so ever (He's an assasin for lord sake). Instead she brings upon a world where people are human. They make human mistakes and they feel human pains. I've cried far too many times reading these books yet I keep coming back for more with doubled enthusiasm. <br />The Tawny man opened a door I didn't think could be opened at this point. One can see Robin Hobb has only gained knowledge and expirience after writting the Farseer and Liveship trilogies. That knowledge is expressed through this book. It has all of the pain, love, sense of duty and realism as the original Fitz books, but it adds a greater sense of mystery and intrigue that we see with the liveship traders. All in all this is an awesome book that keeps you itching for more. It's beautifully written keeping all of it's secrets till the end, and some have still yet to be revealed. Bottom line: I can't wait for the next book.<BR>I recomend this book for just about anyone, serious fantasy readers, and anyone else who wants to envelop themselves in another world for a time.
6304510861|4.0|I have only watched this film once, but I have a couple of comments to make.  First, just as with &quot;Blue Velvet,&quot; this film is cursed with poor acting.  I had the dispiriting sensation that the actors were simply reading a script, and not even understanding it at that.  Totally inadequate for themes as sophisticated as Lynch's.  Second point, don't takes this film literally!  Other reviewers have made the point about so-called dream-logic, and there is certainly no rational logic afoot.  I noticed many interesting themes, such as Pullman-Getty and Arquette-Blake being just different aspects of the same person or dream character and the possibility of time being like a circular prison (Pullman leaves a message for himself at the end of the movie that he hears at the beginning), but the film is focused on none of those themes, for that in itself would make it too narrow to achieve the effect that it does.  This is one of the more cerebral films I have seen and treats its themes infinitely better than shallow and oxnoxious garnish like &quot;Fight Club,&quot; but even so I find myself alienated by the feeling that this movie is essentially insular and not really relevant to life in the way that all genuinely great works are.  An ambiguous effect, but I can now understand the obsession of the David Lynch-ites that I know.
0871137380|5.0|This book is truly amazing.  It will put you right in the middle of the action and gets you very excited.  You are happy when something goes right, and sad when it goes bad.  I would highly recommend this book.
B000056V73|4.0|Here is another movie that I was not eager to see but was glad that I had the chance.  This story is truly about Sex, Drugs and Rock-&amp;-Roll.  It is NOT a family movie though.  Being a product of the 80s, I think I was more able to appreciate the subtleties of the story better.  Certainly my Mother &amp; Father wouldn't understand it quite as well.  <br /><br />What I liked best about the movie is the ending.  That is where all the parts come together.  That is where we, the audience, really get the opportunity to &quot;know&quot; the characters for who and what they are. <br /><br /> I don't own this movie and don't really plan on buying it.  But I am certainly glad to have seen it..once.
0375431624|5.0|THOUGH QUITE OUT OF CHARACTER FOR GRISHAM, THIS STORY WAS A PLEASANT DIVERSION.  IT WAS AMUSING ENTERTAINMENT FOR A RAINY AFTERNOON AND A GOOD SOURCE OF BELLY-LAUGHS.  I LIKED THE ABSENCE OF ANY DEPTH (NO DEEP, DARK UNDERCURRENT) AND NO SINISTER SUB-PLOTS TO CONFUSE THE READER....JUST WITTY DIALOGUE AND GIGGLE-PRODUCING DEVELOPMENTS.  A REALLY FUN, UNPRETENTIOUS PLOT WITH FEEL-GOOD HUMOR--WORTH IT!
B00005ASQ1|5.0|I received this movie today for my birthday.  I said the usual &quot;Oh, Thanks&quot; and set it aside.  Then we watched it.  What a terrific movie, story, plot, acting...it all was simply wonderful.  'Finding Forrester' is the ultimate story of finding friendship, gaining honor, and growing up.  Sean Connery is his usual wonderful self (I do forgive him for the James Bond thing..he does get better with age!!).  <br />I highly recommend this movie to any and all.  I don't get the 'R' rating, though there is some language..the obligatory 'F' word here and there.  That notwithstanding, I think that this movie is great for early teens as well as the 'mature audience.'  It is never too early to learn how to be a friend.
B00004XQ83|5.0|If you like old-timey music without a &quot;Hillbilly Symphony Orchestra&quot; for backup, this is a great CD.  Even the new songs sound old.
B00005RFAI|5.0|From the purposely cheesy new wave retro cover to the choice of guest artists (Linda Perry, Steven Tyler), this is a work of cunning and calculation that musically quotes everyone from Elton John to Prince to Aerosmith. But guess what? You'll love it anyway. I have no doubt that the fun-loving, self-doubting, put-upon young woman she portrays herself as is part pose, but both the lyrics and the singing are heartfelt enough that she convinces me there's a great deal of Pink here as well. After her good-not-great debut, this one is strong enough that it has me wondering if she could pull off a thematic double album a la Prince. Come on, Pink, where's YOUR &quot;Sign 'O the Times?&quot;
B00005JKOV|5.0|When I saw this film, this chimera, this animated marathon philosophy slam, over a quarter of the audience walked out in the middle of it. Some may have suffered motion sickness from the perpetual fluidity of the images; this isn't a movie best watched from the front row. But as I sat transfixed by the magic on the screen, (just one long parade of talking heads - but what talk! and what heads!) my fleeing comrades put me in mind of the teenagers at the prom in Back to the Future, recoiling in horror from a guitar played in Hendrix style. Those Chuck Berry hounds thought they knew what rock 'n' roll was; and we think we know what movies are. But Linklater is here to teach us different.<br />I could write a dozen reviews, trying to explain what's unique and wonderful about this film, without repeating myself. What follows is a random sample.<br />The title embodies a triple pun, reminiscent of the layered meanings of the title &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;. Like Joyce's skewed opus, &quot;Waking Life&quot; examines life, on a huge canvas, from the perspective of a dreamer, a dreamer caught up in a seemngly endless stream of babble. Like Joyce, Linklater uses an elaborate artistic form which attempts to duplicate the structure of dreams - in particular, the way that every dream is a palimpsest, in which dim and dimmer meanings underlie the ones on the surface. Where Joyce tried to pack the multiple meanings in by using jumbled and confusing &quot;portmanteau words&quot; that sounded like several words at once, Linklater lets a series of monologues, each one straightforward and some even obsessionally single-minded, mirror and bounce off one another until each is undergirded by the three dimensional scaffolding of all the rest. <br />Ostensibly the subject of all this talk is dreaming and waking up. But it's also about waking to higher consciousness, about speech itself, about movies themselves as a form of speech and a form of dream. Taken at a literal level, the movie isa little paradise for anyone who really enjoys *listening* to people. Even though the talk is all of abstractions, in each case it's about ideas with which the speaker is deeply and personally engaged; so that lives are spread before us and souls laid bare. It's like having Studs Terkels' &quot;Working&quot;, with its varied gallery of talkers from every station of life, as a documentary rather than as a book, except that now the working title would be &quot;Thinking.&quot;<br />Sure, much of the talk is sophomoric. A sophomore is a wise fool, and all Linklater's talkers qualify; whether &quot;wise&quot; or &quot;fool&quot; is the operative moiety of the oxymoron is up to the viewer. But it is revelatory, in each case, of the person we're listening to; and the polyphony melds into a symphony that beggars its parts. All these voices - together with the lovely self-effacing score - make the soundtrack into a coherent poem cycle that would be worth the price of the DVD on its own.<br />Visually, Linklater has succeeded in putting on screen for the very first time a &quot;dream sequence&quot; which is genuinely dreamlike -- not like the romanticized image of what dreams are like in old tin pan alley tunes, and not like Freudian or Jungian symbolfests. Mullholland Drive raises such conventions to a luminous new level, but even in Lynch's hands they remain film conventions without the real feel of dreams. But this film is like the dreams we actually have each night, or would if we were much smarter and more interesting people. For example, dreams seem photographically real while we're in them - but are in fact lacking in almost all the detail of the waking visual field. Linklater duplicates this experience with his rotoscoping: a photographically real substrate is drained of its detail by drawing flat cartoons over it. And that's just one of many authentic dream characteristics cannily built into the celluloid here.<br />It remains to be seen whether this scrumptious tour-de-force, once it's begun to be absorbed, will change the way movies are made in the future, or whether it will stand forever as the only member of its genre. But if any film made in 2001 is still admired, studied and taught in 2051, it will be this one.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|To say that this movie is terrible is to be an insult to all things terrible.  Once again Hollywood shows that they will put ANYTHING on film.  Kidman is beautiful as always but we already know this.  But using modern musical tunes as the dialog is tiresome.  It would have been a better sell if they had set the movie in current times.  But the people who did this piece of crap decided to set it in 19th century France.  This just does not work it come off as silly.   Steer clear of this movie if you have an IQ of over 40.  But if not rent it and be entertained, sort of.  But above all dont buy it you will be sorry.
B0000009RX|5.0|Looking at the album cover (a parody of &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;), and listening to songs like &quot;Who Needs the Peace Corps?&quot; and &quot;Bow-Tie Daddy&quot;, the casual observer will see this album as an assault on the hypocrisy of the squares and the self-impotrance of the freaks.  But there is also in this album  profound insight (as in &quot;What's the Ugliest Part of Your Body?&quot;), genuine pathos (as in &quot;Mom &amp; Dad&quot;), and surpisingly sophisticated song structures (as in &quot;Let's Make the Water Turn Black&quot;).  It may not always be easy to see Zappa's genius behind the silliness, but it's there.
B00005RJ1U|2.0|but the best way to watch this movie is to turn it off half way through. I know that no one reading this is actual going to turn it off in the middle of the movie...but if you want to walk away from this movie and not want to scream, break the tape or disc, and hope something very bad happens to the makers, shut it off at the point where the brother and sister enter the police station. So my review will consist of 2 parts; before this scene and after it.<br />The first hour has all the makings of an excellent, original, and scary movie that might give you nightmares for weeks. Horror movies in the past 5 years haven't really been scary at all, and most should be direct to video B movies. The acting is top notch. The characters are involving and you start to really care about them. The villain will give you the creeps, and even has a personality (whistles while he's throwing bodies in his truck). There are some &quot;do NOT do this in a horror movie&quot; instances that occur, but one can live with this. Jeepers Creepers appears to the best horror movie in a long time.<br />The second part of the movie, about the last 30 minutes, will leave you very mad. It seems as though they got bored with the movie and wanted to wrap it up quickly. There are some characters introduced for no reason (pyschic woman), gigantic holes in the story, and parts of the story that are never explained (bodies in the church basement, why haven't they decomposed, and why does he return every 23 years). After the last scene and the screen goes black, you are thinking (you would bet money on it) that the movie is not over. I watched a few minutes of the credits just to make sure, plus I was in shock on how bad the movie ended.<br />Now after reading this review, I know you'll watch the whole movie, but you'll ask yourself &quot;why didn't I listen to that guy and turn it off half way through?&quot;. This is the first review I have ever written. I've seen movies that were bad and just not care to write one, but I feel cheated from this movie. I love horror movies, them being my favorite genre (sci-fi's my 2nd favorite). I hated that this movie stunk. Would someone please make a good horror movie?!!
0385505833|1.0|If you've got money to waste, treat yourself to something else.  Grisham should be ashamed of charging for this subliterate drivel.
B00005TT77|5.0|As a fan of The Beatles, I at first was skeptical if any other songs would be good besides Eddie Vedder's cover of You've Got To Hide Your Love Away. I was pleasantly amazed as I listened to the whole cd though. The cd starts rocking in the very first cover, Two of Us, and continues on through to Let It Be. By far most of these songs are a 5, but there are a few 4's at the end.Grandaddy's cover of Revolution is a weird rendition, and Nick Cave's vocals on Let It Be are a bit hard to listen to.I definetely would reccomend this cd to any Beatles fan or anybody whos likes the bands on the cd-you wont be displeased.
B000059XY5|5.0|A great movie. Dark, gothic with a great plot and a fantastic cast.<br />Michael Keaton returns to play a great Batman/Bruce Wayne. Batman has a new costume in this movie.<br />Michelle Pfeiffer plays a seductive Catwoman and s geeky Selina Kyle who, for some odd reason, is a secretary. By the way, can anyone tell me what happens when she fell out of the window?<br />Danny DeVito plays the Penguin who, worryingly, IS a penguin.<br />But other than a few raised eyebrows, this a great sequal, completely on par with it's prequal. Buy it!!!
B00004Z459|5.0|Hybrid Theory is the greatest album ever released, and in my opinion even better than Nirvana's Nevermind. I would rate all songs a 5, except for #11 (all sampling by the DJ). I would give this track a 4. My friend hates rock altogether, but he loves the rapcore flow of this album. I have bought this CD on two occassions. (I lost it once LOL) This album is perfect for a person who has lots of drama in their life, cuz they can relate to the lyrics. Let me tell ya, I can understand where LP is coming from. My favorite tracks are Crawling, Pushing Me Away and With You. This CD only leaves my CD player when I am taking it somewhere else to play, wheter its a discman, a friend's house or the car. I can't leave home without this CD, except for whe I got basketball. LOL But I just hope that no one forgets to pick up this CD. What other album would be ranked #2 on the charts after it's been released for 60+ weeks?!
B00005QZWI|4.0|Howard Shore's score for The Lord Of The Rings has it's fault but is, overall, an extremely atmoshperic and engaging score that enhances the movie in an often uncouncious but powerful fashion. It does contain some cliche's but these are balanced by several fresh idea's like those heard in 'Concerning Hobbits' ot 'Lothlorien'. When compared to other film composers like John Williams, Shore's score doesn't seem quite as polished or intricate but does contain some fabulous and emotional themes like those heard in 'The Breaking of The Fellowship'. As for Enya's work, her contribution to 'The Council of Elrond' is very beautiful and sung in elvish which adds to it's mystique and flow. 'May It Be' isn't as good but is better than most songs written to accompany a movies closing credits. Overall, The Lord Of The Rings is a wonderful soundtrack that I would highly recommend to anyone wanting to relive the magic of the film.
6302914191|5.0|This series has been descibed as a 'surrealist's soap opera', but in actuality it more like a soap opera's dream.  There are better production values, the characters' have many dimensions to them and are as real as possible and this series is far sexier than any soap opera.  Add to that the fact that those elements of soap opera are only a fraction of what the series accomplishes.  It's a soap opera, it's a mystery, it's a small town comdedy, it's even a fantasy/sci-fi story. If that isn't enough, Twin Peaks stands as a precursor to a similar show that you may have hear of, 'The X-Files.' David Duchovny even appears in this series as well.  Basically, it served as a show that would lead you to expect one thing and then hit you with something that many couldn't immediately explain. The show was co-created by David Lynch who is known for his surrealistic endeavors and this carries some of that for people who dig it.  There's a big difference between this and Lynch's other material and that difference is that in his other movies things would happen and the viewer is forced to interpret what is happening without any explanation from the film (at least through verbal dialogue).  Since this is a series that he had co-created for network television he is forced to eventually reveal, through verbal dialogue, the meaning of his surrealistic imagery.  As such, this is the perfect place for a person to be introduced to the world of surrealism and its sometimes confusing imagery/symbolism, in which, every detail is important. It isn't exactly a perfect introduction to Lynch's work though, because he only writes and directs certain episodes so the rest of the episodes are basically written and directed by other people based on his and Mark Frost's blueprints.  Even though this is true, the series was and still is a great example of the possibilities when you create a postmodern mix of different genres. I loved the fact that when I was done watching the series, it would have beenfar from over if the network hadn't cancelled it and this forces me to consider the possibilities had it continued.  <BR>As for the technical aspect of the VHS collector's edition, it's recorded in the EP mode so the sound doesn't come out as good on my old TV, but it sounds good on other new TV's.  If you're worried about that then just buy the DVD collection of the first season.  The only other bummer is the fact that they didn't include the feature-length pilot, but it's still worth the money. I wholeheartedly recommend this.

B00005QZWI|5.0|Can a soundtrack be better?<br />&quot;The Lord of The Rings: The Fellowship of The Ring - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; brings together intense classical and quiet jazz stylings, and is far more than background music to an amazing movie.<br />Enya's voice shines in &quot;The Council Of Elrond&quot; and &quot;May It Be&quot; should become more than just soft jazz hits, but hopefully will be heard on classical, folk and adult listening stations. For those of you who enjoy Christian music and are unfamiliar with Enya, she has a sort of John Michael Talbot spiritual depth to her voice, except she extends it more as an etheral instrument than a mere voice.<br />Buy this CD, crank it up, and let it flow through your rooms or in your car. The digital strength of the recording is profound.<br />How will they follow this up with the next &quot;The Lord of The Rings&quot; movie?<br />I fully recommend the soundtrack to &quot;The Lord of The Rings: The Fellowship of The Ring.&quot;<br />Anthony Trendl
B00005O5JV|4.0|I thought this was a pretty good show. For what it's worth, I thought Reese Witherspoon's two ex-roommates from her fashion design school days were a little tiring. I also thought the moment when the accused killer reveals the truth as to where she was when the crime took place - actually having liposuction - was overdone a bit too. Once could also argue that the witness revealed her guilt too quickly once her lie was exposed on the stand by Reese, which is a black mark against the script. Overall, however, the movie works. It not only reinforces the message that people shouldn't be judged by their appearance or first impression, but also has several very funny moments. Personally I liked this show way more than Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles (3 laughs for the whole movie) or America's Sweethearts (no laughs at all). <br />It was a nice change of pace to see a movie that did not rely heavily on profanity.
B00003CXN4|4.0|I thought this could be the movie that would offer some gritty commentary on the drug 'war', but it isn't. It's directed by Stephen Soderbergh, which means it's stylish and tautly-paced. Three stories are held together by the common theme of drugs, but the only one worth mentioning is the one set in Mexico, a place where \\"law enforcement is an entrepenurial activity\\". Benecio Del Toro plays a police officer in a force where kickbacks are perks of the job, while corruption keeps the cartels in power. When he has the chance to turn those tables, pay close attention to his motivation, and the closing scene of the movie. It just adds another dimension to his character. \\"Traffic\\" blending of fact and fantasy is too much to digest. Some outlandish turn of events left me shaking my head. The film is depressing, but was interspered throughout with some wry humour and snappy banter. Different colour tints are used in various scenes, effectively establishing the mood and setting but it also made it easier to distinguish between each story. Despite some gripes I enjoyed this movie and recommend it.
0385505833|4.0|As a huge Grisham fan, I'll read anything he writes.  I have always preferred his more traditional courtroom novels, and bought &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; expecting that it probably wouldn't be as good.<br />I was wrong.  It was just as good as most of his courtroom novels and was a perfect afternoon's laughfest.<br />Who knew this guy could write such fabulous comedy?  Actually, I did -- his comedy is really quite good in places in some of his other books.  But this one is an out and out sitcom and enjoyable from beginning to end.<br />One word of warning.  The book gets off to a slow start.  I would call it more &quot;amusing&quot; than downright funny for the first half.  Then a specific event occurs which starts the laughs flowing, and it's hysterical from there.  So for those who may have started this book and put it down a few pages in, you really owe it to yourself to give the book another try.
B00005K3OT|5.0|&quot;Chocolat&quot; proved to be my favourite film of 2000. Based closely upon the novel by Joanne Harris, &quot;Chocolat&quot; is much like a fairy tale. It possesses the same sense of magic and whimsy, and the added bonus of beaucoup de.... scrumptious chocolate in every shape and form: moulded nudes, suns, Aztec temples, nipples of Venus, thick hot chocolate with cream.... all of these delicacies, when paired with Vianne's (Juliette Binoche) kindess and knack for guessing favourite chocolates, change the townspeople profoundly.<br />&quot;Chocolat&quot; is a simple, delicious tale of the human heart, of the value of laughter, compassion, and chocolate of course. The DVD does have a making-of featurette and a few deleted scenes, one of which should have been left in the film (Armande's letter to Vianne) as it clarified and added a great deal of meaning. The feature on the film's costumes was also interesting. If you are a fan of romantic comedy/drama, period films (post WWII rural France), or chocolate, this is a wonderful little film in the tradition of &quot;Como agua para chocolate (Like Water for Chocolate)&quot; that blends romance and magic with culinary delights.
0790729725|5.0|I'll give GOODFELLAS five stars. As ma matter of fact, I'd give it six or seven if I could. This film is seminal in the Gangster genre, and deserves to be on the top shelf right next to THE GODFATHER I and II (as Carmela Soprano said, &quot;The Godfather III? What happened?&quot;).<br />The story concerns the doings of one Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), a lifelong wiseguy turned government informant, and how the lousy rat flipped on his friends to save his own pencil neck.<br />The movie is based directly on Nicholas Pileggi's excellent book &quot;Wise Guy,&quot; which chronicles the downfall of the Vario crime family of Brooklyn. Why Scorsese and Pileggi decided to fictionalize some names in the movie (the Varios become the Ciceros) is beyond me, since the book uses real names.<br />Scorsese's directing is so effortless that the movie becomes a literal glimpse through a glass darkly into the real world of organized crime.<br />This movie lacks the operatic overtones of THE GODFATHER, skips the fedoras and the pinstripes,  and focuses far more on the day-to-day low-end extortion, strong-arm, and petty rip-offs of a crime family really struggling to survive in a changing post-war world. Their one big score ultimately proves their undoing.<br />David Chase (creator of THE SOPRANOS) credits GOODFELLAS as his &quot;Koran,&quot; and the GOODFELLAS influence on THE SOPRANOS is immediately obvious.<br />Lorraine Bracco (&quot;Dr. Melfi&quot; in THE SOPRANOS) plays Karen Hill, Henry's long-suffering wife who ultimately becomes his main accomplice. Spectacular performances are handed in by Robert DeNiro (&quot;Jimmy 'The Gent' Burke&quot;) and Paul Sorvino (&quot;Paulie Cicero&quot;).<br />Liotta is wonderful as Hill, a human barometer of the effectiveness of the Mob. Hill's decision to turn rat has no moral scruples to it, it is strictly selfish, and Liotta manages to capture both Hill's fear (of both cops and robbers) and his absolute self-centeredness exquisitely.<br />Michael Imperioli (THE SOPRANOS' &quot;Christopher&quot;) has a small role as &quot;Spider,&quot; a slow-moving waiter who runs afoul of &quot;Tommy&quot; played by Joe Pesci in an Oscar-winning performance. Pesci is so frightening as the psychopathic Tommy that nerves jangle every time he appears on camera. The fact that Tommy is also, ironically, murderously funny, only increases the fear factor.<br />The one failing of this DVD has nothing to do with the film.  It is the only DVD I have seen in years which has to be turned over in the middle. Why this phenomenal film hasn't been reissued in a Special Edition, or remastered to fit on one side of a disc, is absolutely unexplainable.  The break is ridiculously distracting. Until WB reissues it, stick with the VHS format.ichael Imperioli (THE SOPRANOS' &quot;Christopher&quot;) has a small role as &quot;Spider,&quot; a slow-moving waiter who runs afoul of &quot;Tommy&quot; played by Joe Pesci in an Oscar-winning performance.

0812550757|5.0|Thought this book was more than great, very mind expanding.<BR>The title Speaker for the Dead makes it sound like a horror story or something morbid, which is misleading. The lead character Ender was a child general who lead an intersteller army in the distruction of another species which he didn't know because he believed he was just doing battle simulations at the training academy.  Afterward he calls himself the speaker for the dead - the dead being that lost species. When a new intelligent species, the &quot;piggies&quot; are discovered he finds the opportunity to redeem his past. The books moves along alittle slow at times, action wise(Ender's Game the prequil is more fast paced an action packed), but this book is deep.
B00005U122|5.0|This is a fantastic concert DVD from Roger Waters and his all star band.  The material covered showcases many of the highlights from his career with Pink Floyd, as well as material from his solo career.  Most notable are the live renditions of songs from &quot;Amused To Death&quot; - his last full-length solo album.  These songs are performed with an enthusiasm and passion that far outperforms the studio versions.  In fact, what this show has is an incredible dosage of &quot;heart and feel&quot; - the band clearly love what they are doing and, despite being shot in relatively large arena, the DVD shows all the intimacy and subtlety of a small venue performance.  <br />The sound mix is superb (although some may find the back up singers a little loud in the mix) and the concert sounds far better in 5.1 than on the CD version of this concert (released some months beforehand).  Given the ambient, grandiose nature of Roger's music this observation is probably not to surprising to most people familiar with his music. <br />The concert footage is well edited and directed and didn't bombard me with MTV-style cuts and edits that can be so distracting and &quot;schizophrenic&quot;.  Instead the longer, and I believe better thought out shots, allowed me to absorb what was going on.  In fact, it is through these well thought out visuals that you see the passion in the performances and the repect between the musicians.  Something that I felt was lacking a bit from Pink Floyd's &quot;PULSE&quot; concert (although still a favourite).<br />The extras are fairly standard (a half hour documentary about putting the tour together; photo stills; lyrics as subtitles option; etc...) but delivered well and make for nice additions to the actual concert footage.<br />All up this IS the best concert DVD I have seen!  This IS a must for any Floyd/Waters fan.  GREAT STUFF!
B00000IBRX|5.0|Terrific film. I loved it. The acting wonderful. This nearly lead me to tears. This movie and patch adams is one of robin williams best roles. I remember in 1998 when my family watch this at crown casino we just loved it. The special effects are the best. It's like half of heaven is like a painting and the other half is real. It's really wonderful. I hope robin williams does another film like this. It's really a sad film. The actors did a beautiful job. I wish this film won an oscar for best picture, best actor robin williams, best speical effects and best director.<br />Rent this film, watch it, buy it.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|The colors in the restored version jump out at you -- particularly the purple in the Queen's robes, and the glittering jewels in the mine scenes.<br />The extras on this disc are stunning. My four-year-old does a better job with Dopey's Wild Mine Ride than I do. The history of Disney and its Snow White release is a fascinating program, and the unfinished and deleted animation gives an interesting look at where else this movie could have gone.
B00003CXXP|1.0|I disliked this movie so much I wanted to write a negative review about it.  I thought that the story was terrible and the acting wasn't much better.  In the last 30 minutes I kept hoping that it would end, but it continued to drag on painfully.  If you liked in in the theaters go ahead and buy it, but if you haven't seen it I would recommend renting and get some drinks because you'll have to be loaded to watch it.
B000002KON|1.0|... I guess I must be a strange Kinks fan, because I found this CD to be very disappointing. I don't believe there was a single track that I found interesting/entertaining.<br />They've done SO much better...
0060975768|5.0|I've been reading a lot of books featuring stories of combat forces lately:  Black Hawk Down, Ghost Soldiers, Flags of Our Fathers, and now this book by Lt. General Moore.  I guess what I'm looking for is some sense of what this abstract quality is that causes men (and now women) to place themselves in harm's way and potentially give up their lives and their futures for their country.  I'm not sure I've found it yet in these books, but I've seen hints of it.  The only thing I know for sure about this quality is that I don't have it and the men in this book do.<br />Lt. Gen. Moore, the author of this book, was the commander of the 450 men of the 1st battalion, 7th cavalry when they engaged in combat in the Ia Drang valley in November, 1965.  This was very early in the war and these men were not sure what to expect.  This book tells the story of the horrific battle that followed from a very human standpoint.  While there was significant carnage, General Moore treats not a single casualty as a statistic.  He describes every soldier in the most human of terms, who they were, where they were from, and their actions in this battle.  The tactics and flow of the battle are described flawlessly, but mostly this is a human story.<br />One of the closing chapters of the book is given to the families of the men who died, to tell their side of the story of losing their husband, son, or father.  I'm not a man often moved to tears...but I was moved to tears.  Battle can never be considered casually.  The cost is just too high.<br />I don't think I've found the answer to my question yet and probably never will, but this book moved me a step closer.  At the very least, I've concluded I'm a selfish idiot with a comfortable life whose biggest concern is whether to order the chicken or the fish.  The people who wear the uniform...are heroes.
B000001DTM|5.0|This is a great CD. I just bought it, and it's awesome. I have always liked U2. I'm just not into what the other girls are listening to, and I probably never will. Bono and the rest of U2 really deserve 5 stars. I bought it only for &quot;One&quot; and &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot;, but wound up loving the whole entire CD. U2 might not be a &quot;new group&quot;, but they sure do know how to rock (Even my dad remembers U2, and he likes them a lot also)! The song &quot;One&quot; is a very sad song and I like to listen to it when it's raining or if I'm just in a bad mood. If you've bought any other CD's by this incredible rock band, you definitely should get this one!
B00005U8EM|5.0|[....]<br />This is Bill Murray's best movie (along with Ghostbusters & Mad Dog and Glory) and also the best movie of Harold Ramis (as a director).<br />When I saw the movie for the first time, it was like a breath of fresh air among all other Hollywood releases at the time (boring, stupid, predictable). Why? Because you knew how it's gonna end (obviously, it's a romantic comedy), but you didn't know WHEN! and believe me, you don't want it to end... <br />Worth noticing is also the fact that movie sparks genuine feelings for the characters (even sporadic ones), otherwise absent from other Harold Ramis/Ivan Reitman/Bill Murray/Dan Aykroyd movies. The quartet (working together or not) mostly have interesting ideas how to amuse people and make them laugh, but they often fail to make us care for the characters involved.<br />For those of you from other planets, the plot involves a conceited weatherman (Murray) stuck in time on the worst day of his life. So he has to live the day again and again (see the title) until... Well, you know. Not even death can stop his misery. Andie MacDowell is lovely as a producer/love interest and all other performances are funny beyond words. The funniest, of course, is Bill Murray himself.<br />This is much better than \\"Multiplicity\\" (Harold Ramis directed this after Groundhog Day with Andie reprising her role, and Michael Keaton replacing Murray), and funnier than \\"12:01\\" (a TV movie with a similar premise, also very good - check it out!).<br />I hope there will be many deleted scenes or outtakes in the special features part of DVD, because I think they had so much fun making this movie...
6302150930|2.0|To say I was let down by this film is an understatement. We go from Tess being a farm girl to a noblewoman in 5 minutes. We go through her meeting her &quot;cousin&quot; Alec, the affair (on screen a one time interlude), and the birth &amp; death of their baby at lighting speed. Nothing is clearly explained and it's all confusing. Enter in her heart breaking marriage to Angel and one must say just how bad can this movie get. While Nastassja Kinski and Peter Firth are an extremely attractive couple they lack any sort of on screen chemistry. To watch this movie is to spend 3 hours in the midst of the most miserable heart break and despair. This is NOT a feel good flick.
0525946284|4.0|I think that this is Ken Follett's best work in <BR>a long time.

0385505833|4.0|Never skip Christmas, it could happen as the book,you should never risk it.Having lived in suburbia in the sixtys and again in the mid 80's I had to laugh aloud. I see the one upmanship still happens,of course,that is the basis of the story. A great little story,it assures me that our decision to live rural was a very good one. I did feel this was far off Grisham's usual.I had to wonder if his name was there but he was not the 100 percent Author.
B00005R2M3|3.0|Ok, so i admit that laundry service is not Shakira's best album. i like it ok but in comparison to the standard she set with Donde estan los ladrones in '98, this latest album definitaly falls short.  However, i want to set one thing straight. Shakira is NOT POP! pop princesses JLo and Britney have never even touched an instrument, let alone written their own lyrics.  Shakira might not always triumph in the music world, but she is ALWAYS an original. so go ahead and buy this disk if you want-Objection, Poem to a Horse, Eyes Like Yours, and Fool are all good songs. But if you want the best of a truly great artist, buy Donde estan los Ladrones.
0767802470|5.0|This film is simply the best war film ever made.  The filming, sound, and acting is flawless.  This movie must be seen in German to appreciate its power and potency.  You do definately feel like you're a member of the U-boat crew when you watch this.  After a while you really don't need the subtitles to understand what is going on.  You find yourself praying for these men and hoping they survive.  In the end you realize that common humanity is more important than nationality or politics!  A must see for all!
0780622553|5.0|A remarkably well done story and a giant in it's genre.I rate this DVD number 1 in my top 10 list of greatest, must own sci-fi and/or film noir.&quot;The Matrix&quot; was a badly done rip off of this very idea,but it can't compete.I do own &quot;Matrix&quot; but for completely different reasons and would not put it in the same category.One of my favorite parts was the ending,which was a good one AND came off well for a change.My favorite scene:when shown exactly where the &quot;city&quot; existed in &quot;space&quot;.Great stuff.No one's collection can be complete without this DVD.
0786867973|5.0|I heard about Nigella from English relatives last summer. Then I caught her show on the Style Network. She's a great cook, beautiful, and she truly does flirt all the way through. It's all done with a bit of kitsch, so it's OK in my book. I ordered my copy of this book from Amazon.co.uk, so the version I have has English measurements and ingredients, so be warned that that's the version I'm reviewing.<br />Nigella is first and foremost a brilliant writer. Even if you aren't planning on cooking anything at all from this book, it's enjoyable to have, as the prose is a pleasure to read, and the photography is beautiful.<br />Here in the US, we have this view of English cookery as being bland, boring, and not worth our time. Nigella will quickly put those views to rest. She is, like me, an avid cookbook junky, and she always cites her sources, so you're getting recipes filtered through Nigella from sources all over the place.<br />I have this book on my coffee table, and my husband and I are both always leafing through it. The Nigella recipes I've tried have always worked out, and I've been able to choose with confidence, since each recipe is described in painstaking detail. You know what to expect. And you often have a photo to check out, too.<br />Most recipes are intended to be easier than the resulting dish would have eaters believe. So, less work, more praise. Hell, maybe she is overcompensating for something else in her cooking, but more power to her. We're the better for it. She does it knowingly with beautiful irony, especially in the title.<br />Love Nigella. She's going to take on the world.
B0000062S0|3.0|Page and Plant seem to have bought into their own press. _WiC_ shows them coasting on their rep, having brought in a couple of amateur punks as their rhythm section. \\"When The World Was Young\\" is sheer beauty; \\"Blue Train\\" is a mellow ride. \\"Most High\\" could have been on a Plant solo album. The rest are unremarkable songs that sound alike. We'll never know why Robert wouldn't bring Jonesy back; more's the pity. Check out _Zooma_ and _The Thunderthief_ instead.
0446608955|5.0|My friends and I all wanted to read this book before we go to see the movie, and every friend of mine that has read it has read it within a few hours!  It is such a wonderful book, none of us could put it down!  True, the main story is rather predictable, but it's the little surprises thrown in that kept me interested.  I have never laughed out loud during a book, nor have I ever cried as much during a book that I did this one.  You become truly engrossed in the entire story.  I can only hope that the movie will be as good as the book was!  I know I'll return to read this book again, and I strongly reccommend it to anyone looking for a good book to curl up and read!
0345448898|2.0|I feel like I've been mugged.  Seriously, these books were a scandal, and they have caused me pain that I never want to feel again. I will admit that I wanted Will and Lyra to fall in love, but not 50 pages too soon.  Such a struggle to read through... such agony...  By the end of this saga, I didn't care.  I had trouble remembering why I loved The Golden Compass.  I have forgotten the mastery of The Subtle Knife.  Indifference. pure horrible indifference.  The worst pain of all!
B00003CXRP|5.0|Last year at the Oscar's, I was worried that Russell Crowe or Geoffrey Rush would lose to Tom Hanks for the best actor Oscar.  Don't get me wrong, Hanks is a phenomenal actor.  Most consider him to be the best actor of our generation (after all, no one else, besides Spencer Tracy, has ever won back to back Oscars).  But him picking up a third trophy for Cast Away?!?  Come on.  He was a hundred times better in the Green Mile, and he wasn't even nominated.  But....Cast Away recently premiered on HBO.  Thank God I decided to watch it again.  My opinion of this film has drastically changed.  This movie did extremely well at the box office, but I still think many people missed the gist of the film.  Perhaps I did, because my first reaction wasn't all that great.  I believe Cast Away is one of those films that has to grow on you.  The more you watch it, the more you'll &quot;get it&quot;.  The whole movie, in my opinion, can be summed up in the last thirty seconds of the film.  Hanks is standing in the middle of the intersection and looks directly into the camera, with this worried, yet hopeful look on his face.  A terrific way to end the movie.  It says so much without saying anything at all.  As for the DVD itself, it's great.  A double disc packed full of extras.  Pick it up.  If you have doubts about seeing this movie, don't worry.  So did I.  But I think after you watch it a few times, you'll be able to appreciate it more.  When I first watched it in the theater, I really couldn't understand why it received all of the accolades it did.  Now I know why.  Any actor's performance who can carry a movie without hardly any dialogue is worth a look.  Hanks is superbe, the music is heartwrenching, and the underlying moral is great.  In fact, the movie Cast Away isn't even really about a man deserted on an island----it's much deeper than that.  The beginning can be slow at times, but the movie itself is worth a viewing --- especially for the scene in which Chuck must say goodbye to Wilson.  Some may poke fun at it, but they were missing the entire point.  Cast Away is a movie that should have us all thinking about what we value in life.  As Bob Zemeckis said, &quot;Surviving might be easy, but it's living that's tough&quot;.
0780631684|4.0|Don't know why they needed so many script writers to lift the plot of 'The Dead Zone'. This is a puerile film and I'm embarrassed to admit I loved almost every minute of it. It really gives you the heebie geebies. You'll scream. You'll laugh. You'll be nervous taking the rental back to the shop. You'll buy the DVD so as to avoid having to take the rental back to the shop. You'll still be nervous taking it out of the DVD. Superbly directed by James Wong, the garage bit at the end is over the top though. Bit like saying the Pope's Catholic, I suppose. Also, the John Denver reference was tasteless, he does have relatives, you know. This film has a vibe that can really drive you nuts and the fact that there's a dead link that takes you nowhere when you press the 'see all editorial reviews' below doesn't help. Is it a sign? &lt;Tremble&gt;
B00005QZWI|5.0|Howard Shore, now-famous for scoring innumerable movies, and Enya shared the honors of providing music to the epic based off the J.R.R. Tolkien, &quot;The Lord of The Rings.&quot; The result is a very nice blend between a sound like that of the most memorable epic soundtracks (the like of James Horner's &quot;Braveheart&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot;), choirs much in the style of John William's scoring of the &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot; and the soothing sounds of celtic music. You will certainly enjoy it, just as much as I'm sure you'll enjoy the movie.

0679882820|5.0|I have been reading this book to my son since birth every night. He loves it. He is now 4 months old and loves to help turn the sturdy board book pages. The different noises that Mr. Brown makes are very intriging to babies and it gives them something to try to imitate. He also likes looking at the colorful illustrations in this book. It is one that we will be reading/reciting for years!
B000002BQK|5.0|This CD is where Mariah Carey lost a lot of her fans! The dreaded music faux pas; the transition from Pop/Mainstream to Hip-Hop/R'n'B! Most artists when attempting this will fall flat bang on their mainstream face, but, Mariah Carey has surpassed herself, presenting almost a cracking debut in itself, a new album in a new style from a happy and sexy, recently divorced woman! <BR>Expecting a full blown heart touching ballad to begin the album would leave you shocked when a banging Hip-Hop tune thumps into play. &quot;Honey&quot; the first single taken from this album went straight to number one as most of hers had done in previous years. It's slick, with a classy array of artists, including P. Diddy, Bone Thug's and Harmony, Da Brat and Jermaine Dupri. Other guests who contributed to the album non-vocally include Prince and Missy Elliot. My own love of R'n'B came from this album because it showcases so many different musical influences that she had suppressed because of Sony Music and it's heavy hand.<br />For those who picked Mariah up at this stage in her career, will love the tracks on this album, aswell as those on the two following albums Rainbow and Glitter.<BR>For those expecting the ballads, there are plenty here for them to feast on, and some special little surprises along the way including a certain diamond of a track called &quot;The Beautiful One's&quot;. Those who love Mariah simply for the Ferrari of a voice she has boxed up in her throat will find her vocals impressively strong on many of the tracks, along with her angelic and heart felt empathy that go together with these beautiful songs just as Adam and Eve went together.<br />I could rave about this album for ever, because it simply is pure gold (or platinum, if you care to keep with the hip-hop times)! If you're on the market for a credible R'n'B album then you should snap this one up right away and forget the emotional troubles frenzy that have surrounded Mariah Carey of late and let this album that oozes a sumptuous quality I haven't been able to find since, sweep you away on a stream of &quot;Honey&quot;!
B00000099Y|5.0|I just can't believe how incredibly good this is. Tool is my favorite band, and this is my favorite of their albums. Every song is amazing, Maynard James Keenan is the best singer out there, in my opinion. (especially with A Perfect Circle.) And all the other instruemts flow perfectly with each other. How did I find out about them? A friend told me to download &quot;Stinkfist&quot;... I didnt know what to think, because back then, I really didn't like that much music, but after a few listens I was hooked, and eventually bought it. There is only 9 actual songs on here, but they add up to about 65 minutes of music. The fillers in between the songs are there to let you take a deep breath in betwen the songs because they're so good. ;) Each songs is very unique, the lyrics are meaningful and don't suck, and I just have to mention again, that Maynard is an outstanding singer that sends chills down my spine [so does Chino from Deftones ;) ] I am not going to suggest any songs because each and every one is incomparibly different from the next and amazing... Anyways I don't see how anyone can call themself a music fan if they don't own this album. Buy it now, and you'll see. You won't be dissapointed and it will not leave your CD player for a few weeks, and when it does leave your CD player, it won't leave for long. ;)
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Having hated the soundtrack the first time I heard it a few months ago, I have to admit I was skeptical to say the least, to check out this movie. But I did, and I'm gladly surprised: the things that ignorance can trick you into thinking... This movie is directed by Baz Luhrmann, the same genius behind the extravagant-yet-amazing version of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; starring Leonardo Di Caprio a few years ago.<br />Now, on a similar note, he brings this wonderful work starring Scottish Ewan McGregor and gorgeous Nicole Kidman in front of a production that could be compared to Broadway musicals, while retaining a special life of its own, with an abundant sense of humor (take the blend of lyrics of highly-known pop songs into the most unpexected dramatic situations and the Argentinian that falls asleep everywhere, for instance) and some visuals that will leave you astounded. Unconventional as it is, the movie explores a genre that might as well only belong to Luhrmann forever, but the matter of the fact is that it accomplishes its goal in storytelling while resulting highly entertaining and filled with some very good acting, specially by McGregor.
630439845X|5.0|One of the rare masterpieces of American Cinema, The Piano stands among the most memorable movies I've ever seen. A fortunate cast with Paquin-Hunter-Keitel, an intriguing original screenplay combined with brilliant director's work are bringing this movie towards the peak of artistic cinematography. The image of human greatness it suggested will stay in my mind as long as I live.
0452282152|4.0|GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING is writing at its best, both in terms of the concept, and of the prose itself.  Author Tracy Chevalier has written a novel in the first person, her narrator being a sixteen-year old girl who is forced, due to her own family's dire finances, to work as a maid for the family of the 17th century painter Johannes Vermeer.<br />In the voice of the heroine, Chevalier reveals how difficult life was in those long-ago days.  She never is maudlin, however, nor even obvious.  This is a quiet book, which the reader will have to study for its nuances. <br />Oddly, in the peculiar way of coincidences, this book came out very close in time to GIRL IN HYACINTH BLUE.  Not only are these titles similar, but both of these books engage in fictional explorations of particular aspects of the life of Vermeer.  Read together, these two books are as good as a class on the Old Masters.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Snow White and the Seven Dwarves was the first animated feature film ever.  It was made in a time when animater's didn't have any reference point to follow, and before Walt Disney Studios became a money printing factory.  If your sick of Disney commercialism please remember this film came out in the thirties when animation was still quite good, and may I say they did a beutiful job.<BR>But you allready know about the movie.  You want to hear about the DVD extras.  I've been watching this thing for three days and I still haven't seen everything.  And listen to this.  The audio commentery is by Walt Disney.  You read that correctly.  Pieces of interveiws and comments he made about the film between it's release and his death have been placed in the apropriate spots and edited together to make a commentery track from beyond the grave, one I never would have thought possible.  There is a documentary, hosted by Angela \\"Lovet's Meat Pies\\" Landsbury (who also star's in a special feature that teaches us how to use the special features), about the making and history (and prehistory) of the film.  The DVD also contain's a classic Disney \\"Silly Symphony\\" short, The Goddess Of Spring, and tons of pencil tests, story boards, concept art, deleted songs and ....<BR>Oh yeah, it also has Striesand, If you can tolerate it.
B00005QDW1|1.0|If I could have given this cd 0 stars, I would have.  What happened to No Doubt's sound?  And their songs used to have meaning, which is why they were one of my favorite bands.  Gwen had the perfect almost-whiny voice for what they were doing, the  punk/ska type sound, but now they sound like just another crappy band.  I knew it was going downhill when the first single released had a rapper in it.  ...
B00003CXTG|5.0|First of all, let me tell you this Pearl Harbor is a film by Micheal  Bay, what they do is to make an at least breathtaking movie that entertains the audience, because they things for the audience!, and tell me is Pearl Harbor as bad as many people say?<BR>No, it isn't, many people say is corny because of it's dialouge and love story, hey it tries to give us a look at the 1940's, that kind of dialouge was preety much said on those times, and the love story, hey i think that the love triangle was very effective, though it could have worked better in the Hal Hartley style, but hey at least is watchable! unlike the cheesey love story in Titanic which looked heavily sadical and looked more like a dark comedy with James Cameron's direction and James Horner's cheesey music, the special effects in Pearl Harbor are the real treat, they are more real than most movies today, the acting was really good, but i think that Cuba Gooding Jr's character deserves more screentime, but the perfomance of Jon Voight is very real.<BR>What critics use is really obvious, when they see that a film is going to be a really big hit they trash it, they consider it as an idiocy, but then you go see the movie and you like it and then you are an idiot, the answer from them will be yes, because they consider themselves experts, they are experts on trashing things, and is a great thing they didn't trash &quot;Harry Potter&quot;,&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;Shrek&quot;<BR>Have a nice day

B000002OVJ|5.0|...The Who are the greatest live band ever and they're all on a high point here: Keith Moon's drumming is his usual wild, insane--and great--self on drums; John Entwistle's bass lines and solos prove only Paul McCartney is his competition as best bass player ever and his vocals are great; Pete Townshend's guitar parts--riffs, licks, and solos--all are inspired pieces of work and his improvisation (more of that later) proves his genius; and Roger Daltrey's vocals show off his amazing range perhaps for the first time in The Who's career. But now: track for track:<br />\\"Heaven and Hell\\"--John wrote and sang this great morality-tale rocker, but was the studio version is a true rarity, released only as the B-side to \\"Summertime Blues\\".<br />\\"I Can't Explain\\"--their first hit single comes off like a charm live.<br />\\"Fortune Teller\\"--the first cover in this set (also covered by The Rolling Stones) speeds up amazingly.<br />\\"Tatoo\\"--one of my favorites from one of my favorite albums (THE WHO SELL OUT) gets a live performance and it beats the album version.<br />\\"Young Man Blues\\"--Moses Allison cover is another solid effort, but its hardly blues...comes from the original LP<br />\\"Substitute\\"--another track from the original LP, this beats the studio version handily though it seems too short.<br />\\"Happy Jack\\"--Keith takes control with drums here, their first U.S. hit single.<br />\\"I'm a Boy\\"--a wonderful performance of one of the quirkiset Who songs ever ends what Pete called \\"a collection of hits, well the easiest ones.\\"<br />\\"A Quick One (While He's Away)\\"--performance of \\"TOMMY's parents\\" with some great trade-offs on vocals from Roger, Pete, and John almost steals the whole show.<br />\\"Amazing Journey\\"/\\"Sparks\\"--a selection from the TOMMY performance that night is fine, but they should've chosen \\"See Me, Feel Me\\"/\\"Listening To You\\" instead (know I have to spend more money!).<br />\\"Summertime Blues\\"--Eddie Cochran cover, released as a single and deservedly got Top 40 placement; from the original LP.<br />\\"Shakin' All Over\\"--cover of a group that performed with the early Who called The Pirates, this was another highlight of the original LP.<br />\\"My Generation\\"--L-O-N-G (14:27!), but exciting performance (original LP) of not just \\"My Generation\\" but also \\"See Me, Feel Me\\"/\\"Listening To You\\" (I still get this!), \\"Sparks,\\" various blues covers, and great improvs from Pete, who is a genius of improvisation.<br />\\"Magic Bus\\"--another extended version (and original LP track), this adds more lyrical fun (\\"100 pounds!\\" \\"95!\\" Won't take less!\\") from Pete and Roger in what is perhaps the most pure fun Who song.<br />That is the 14 track magnificence of LIVE AT LEEDS. I have a friend who says live albums are just a marketing ploy to make more money. I think I'll play him this and WINGS OVER AMERICA and maybe he'll change his mind.

0060278234|5.0|After reading Sabriel I had to get more and Lirael was the answer.  In the beginning it was so sad since she had no mom and no dad and no sight(which is what the clayr call if you can see the future). On her birthday they announce they have seen the sight in someone and Lirael knows it is her.  She finds out after all that it is not.  Years go by for her waiting to have the sight.  In the meanwhile she works in the library with her faithful companion the direputable dog.  Over all I think this book was the best yet Garth Nix needs to get the next one out since it ended kind of like the Golden Compass series.  I also am debating whether this book was better than Sabriel and right now I think it is.  If you read Sabriel I don't know how you could not go on with out reading this!
B00003CXB7|5.0|When I first saw M*A*S*H the movie on TV after being a fan of the series, I didn't like it much. Upon repeated viewings it began to grow on me and over the years has become one of my favorite films. In fact, I bought a laserdisc player in 1995 just to be able to own a widescreen copy of it. Seeing it in widscreen was like seeing it for the first time. Seeing it this past week on the DVD brought the same experience. Both picture and sound restoration are simply marvelous and bring a fresh appreciation to a film I have seen at least 50 times. There are plenty of extra features. I too was a little disappointed in Altman's commentary but it does not spoil the overall package. A five star film, a five star DVD set.<br />This film ain't for everyone. It has no conventional story line and the overlapping dialogue may require reapeating viewings to pick up everything--although I still get something new everytime I see it. It's gory, sometimes mean, sometimes crude and sometimes slapstick. Drop your paradigms on movies, forget what you know and expect about film, forget the TV series, and just enjoy the experience. Give it a chance. You may hate it at first but if you are somehow drawn to it as I was, give it another chance. It just may grow on you. And one day you too may realize that Altman created one of the most brilliantly made films ever. There is nothing else like it. Now if only I could see it at the theater on the big screen.

The scene in the movie where Rcoky is thinking back about the times he had with Apollo, it just brings tears to your eyes... You can't help but think of Apollo in most of the songs...

B00005JKMO|2.0|Michael Mann's &quot;Ali&quot; is not really a bad film. But, I wouldn't go as far as to say it's a good film either. It's somewhere in the middle. Unlike Muhammad Ali himself, &quot;Ali&quot;, the film, doesn't pack much of a punch. It feels like the script, which was written by several people, including Mann himself, coulda used more time in the gym preparing. The film doesn't supply me with anything I don't know about Ali already! It doesn't tell me or teach me anything new about his life. It doesn't tell me what made Ali want to become a boxer. Who were his inspirations? None of this is revealed. People who know nothing about Ali's life will find to film to be not only entertaining, but, as an education into the life of a very controversial man. People whom are already fans of Ali will undoubtedly enjoy the film. Because after-all, if your a fan of the sports legend, you'll be happy to see anything about your hero's life. But, I'm not a fan of Ali on a personal level. So the story, right from the start had a lot to live up to if it was going to impress me. I admit though, I did end up liking the film more than I thought I would, but, not enough to recommend it to people.<br /> &quot;Ali&quot; is nicely directed by Mann, and has good performances by Jon Voight, who is probably one of my favorite things about the film. I was midly amused by Ron Silver and Jamie Foxx, and I thought Will Smith was OK, in the title role. Jada Pinkett Smith, I feel, strikes out. The problem with her is, there's no screen-time for her. She has nothing to work with. Infact, to be honest, the only bit of information I got out of &quot;Ali&quot; was, I didn't know the names of his wives.<br />  The other problem with &quot;Ali&quot; besides the screenplay is the fact that the story has no meaning. The story is not consist enough to keep our interest for the entire lenght of the film which is 2 hours and 47 minutes. It's not a strong enough of a story. &quot;Ali&quot; has moments also where it feels preachy a bit. It's too sentimental. Though, the film does have it's moments where it works. I really don't want to sound like &quot;Ali&quot; is an awful film. It's not. I've seen worst. But, like I said, if you know a lot about &quot;Ali&quot; you will not come away with anything you didn't know before. It's not like we all don't know who was going to win the championship in the &quot;rumble in the jungle&quot; fight. An average movie with average results.  ** 1\2 out of ****feels preachy a bit.

B00005RHGK|2.0|We had been eager for the DVD release of Jeepers Creepers for a while, since there are so few decent scary movies anymore. Unfortunately we were largely disappointed. The beginning of the film showed some promise, but I found it difficult to feel any sympathy for the main characters. The male lead wasn't terribly appealing and the female lead was borderline bitchy for the entire movie. As is usually the case some of there actions and responses were unbelievably silly. There were some decent shocks and the pacing was well metered, but for me there were far too many whys?? The script seems to touch on alot of things simply to try to tie things together, the title song, the psychic, the &quot;house of pain&quot; etc. They never seemed to explain where this thing comes from or why he does what he does, or what he does the other 22 years. <BR>  Plus while I appreciate a non-Hollywood ending this felt like they ran out of cash and said, I guess we need to end it here. We can only hope Jeepers Creepers 2 will tie up some of the loose ends and FLESH out some of the rest of the story.
B0000025DT|5.0|Despite their success, I still think that ELO are one of the underrated and under-appreciated bands in pop. Jeff Lynne is a pop genius when it comes to production arrangement and songwriting. The tunes he wrote for ELO were catchy, clever and memorable and the bands vocal harmonizing is dead on (does anybody know who sings the really high falsetto? bandmember or session singer?). A NEW WORLD RECORD is one of my favorite albums. It's the kind you can listen to over and over again and still find fresh and funny. TELEPHONE LINE and DO YA are just great songs--period.

B00005NWM3|1.0|I was listening to the radio this morning when the DJ started talking about how the lead singer of the next band actually went to music stores to promote the product placement of their albums. The DJ went on to explain that the band member was fomerly in the magazine business and continued his habit of going store to store to ensure that his product was prominently placed and make sure it was re-stocked when sold out. He actually goes to the front desk and complains if dissatisfied. I was really curious to find out who this band was. I figured it better be good if they were audacious enough to provide unsolicited consultation like that. The next song played was Nickelback's latest hit single. I was appalled that the DJ's story was about such a lousy band. They're lucky their cds are even available, let alone prominently placed on record store shelves. If I were a music store manager, I wouldn't tolerate such gratuitous self-promotion. I do have to commend the guy from Nickelback, however, for his guts and his hands-on approach. I couldn't imagine too many other artists who would actually do their own dirty work like this guy does. On the other hand, I became even more disillusioned about the music industry's increasing emphasis on market savvy over music. Of course, most people (if not everyone) who read this review will rate it as unhelpful because they're already converted fans or admire the guy's audacity. I'm disgusted, though, because it's bad enough that crappy music is crammed down our throats from various sources of media. Now it's being taken one step further. Where does it all end?

B0000089A1|5.0|As an avid Kinks fan, I can say that this is one of the bands best pieces of work. Musically very different from ARTHUR, this album blends very well and every song is entertaining. From the deliciously scathing DENMARK STREET to the gentle A LONG WAY FROM HOME and of course LOLA her(or HIM?)self. This album is a vicious attack on the pretentious pop machine that in just five or six short years after this album would bring on (AAAGH!) disco. STRANGERS (definately one of Dave's more poignant compositions) helps distinguish the album's friends from its enemies. Like VILLAGE GREEN, LOLA is a must-have for any Kinks fan, and if you don't know a lot about the Kinks, this disc is a good introduction.
0064471837|5.0|Garth Nix's book Sabriel is one of the best books i've read(it might as well be the best) This tale of quests, love, evil, death, and strange twists and turns makes it impossible to put down. I must admit though it was very confusing at the beginning becuse i couldn't figure out what 'Mogget' was. I later realised that he was one of the evil cratures turned loyal and helpful by a ring/collar. This book is about an 18 year old girl named Sabriel that starts a journey to find her fathers body so he can defeat Kerrigor, Touchstone's half brother. Touchstone was once a royal gaurd who when crazy after the Queens death (murder). Once he settles down he finds him self fighting along side Sabriel. He finally admits hes in love...<br />In other words read the book and you will find out.
B00002MZ2T|3.0|Am I the only Savage Garden fan who thinks their first album is better? After I bought the debut album, I listened to it constantly. I was really looking forward to their follow-up. I figured they could go one of two ways. Either take a left turn and become more experimental, or become even more commercial than they already were. They chose the latter of the two. Don't get me wrong. Affirmation has its moments. I don't think it's a bad album. Some of the lyrics may even be more personal. But I don't think Affirmation lives up to the hype generated by Savage Garden's diehard fans. Although I still like their music, I've dubbed their name as Commercial Garden. 'The Animal Song' actually does sound like a commercial. 'I Knew I Loved You Before I Met You' is a lazy re-write of 'Truly Madly Deeply.' This album is ideal for Top 40 buffs who want to hear music that is instantly accessible. Although Savage Garden self-titled had commercial viability, I think Affirmation has definitely gone one step further in affirming their status as a commercially oriented pop duo. Once again, I'm really not trashing Affirmation. I think 'Crash And Burn' is one of the best things they've done. I just think their first album had more of an edge and still is more exciting to listen to.
6302101743|5.0|Awesome movie!  What more could you ask for?  History meets Pre-History, man vs monsters, cowboys vs dinosaurs.  A classic sci-fi film with a twist.  Great for kids and fans of old monster flicks.  I just wish they had it on DVD......
B00005NTJK|5.0|First off, this is my favourite Tull album of all time. There was never another album that sounded quite like this one, and that puts it in a class by itself. First the positive: A great cd to be sure plus bonus tracks. Now the negative: Amazingly, there is no deluxe booklet(which there should have been)no lyrics and no information about the remastering, just some brief notes by Ian Anderson and that's it. The sound is both a blessing as well as a curse. The newly remastering breathes life into this gem by clarifying the instruments. Unfortunately, the curse is increased grunge and distortion(intentional?)as well as a overall muddy soundstage. The 80's remastered copy suffers the same fate with increased tape hiss. Now granted, this is a 32 year old recording and perhaps this is as good as it will ever be. But since this is my favourite cd by Tull, I was expecting a complete remastering clean-up. Sadly, it was not to be. I still love this cd and would never give it up but if you are a Tull fan of this title, don't expect miracles with the sound quality. 14 Tracks/54.55.

B00001YXH6|5.0|I first saw this video at a cousin's who hapened to have it, the video does not only entertain but it will make you curious enough to want to see it in person, even though the Quidam troop is not presently on tour in the U.S. The idea behind Cirque du Soleil not to use performing animals will not bother you once you begin watching. There are high altitude acts with no net, such as a ladythat comes down at high altitude on a piece of strong fabric and doing contortions in mid air with little else holding her. There are no clowns in the traditional sense, but there is a character named John who dances juggles and does some pretty funny physical comedy with a set of darts witha bulseye held flat on top of his head. Other great acts are a german young man who perfoms the german wheel which is a two dimensional wheel with monkey bar handles a great feat of coordination, agility and strength, making the wheel go forwards, backwards, sideways while he is inside this wheel controlling it with the use of his body. Another interesting act is a contortion and hand balancing act by a perfomer named Olga Pikienko, she has great highly cordinated choreographed moves moving from one set of balancing beams no larger than the size of a foot or hand. It is a grand production with music perfomed live, a story which centers on loosing our inner child by becoming consumed with the material self obsessed world. Highly recommended for anyone curious about Cirque du Soleil, I have viewed it several times and don't easily tire of it...
B000059MEK|4.0|After hearing the hit single One More Time, you couldn't imagine my disgust at how daft punk decided to enter the world of cheesy vocal dance music. However, I decided to listen to some of the samples...and I was instantly hooked. Besides One More Time,this album is full of an amazing blend of genres that would be unexpected from a house group. Aerodynamic is a wonderful song including some guitars looping over each other in a frenzy of melody. Harder Faster Better Stronger is one of my favorite Daft Punk songs, having some nice computerized vocals in tune with the sleaze beat and the funk guitar in the background. Crescendolls is my favorite track of the album, taking me back to the &quot;Burnin&quot; track off of Homework. A nice disco sample, some happy cheers, and a crazy loopy guitar. Lastly, the other highlight of this is Short Circuit,full of cheesy techno blips and crappy midi drums,and yet, its very appealing and doesnt lose its novelty.<BR>Other hnorable mentions-Digital Love(of course!),Nightvision,Voyager
B00000K0DT|5.0|Serpentine mystery that will keep you guessing until the very end. Outstanding cast, script, and direction. One of the finest motion pictures I've ever seen.DVD sidenote: Commentary track with Singer &amp; McQuarrie actually worth watching.
B000001GQP|4.0|This was the third recording of Carmina Burana I had ever listened to and at the time, I thought it was the best.  However, after hearing James Levine's recording, this one has become second best.<br />Don't get me wrong... it's very Germanic, robust, strong, and exciting in every aspect.  But technically, it has it's share of problems.  The choir and orchestra fight with one another and A LOT of pronunciation gets lost to shouting.<br />All that aside, I'm giving Jochum's recording five stars because of the energy injected into it.  It drives faster and faster and is truly a heart pounding performance.<br />The soloists are exemplary, with Fischer-Dieskau's Abbot's song amazingly acted out in song.<br />The Roasted Swan Song is in a Stolze's falsetto, a quality that gives it an amusing vulgarity.<br />And I don't care what anyone says about Gundula Janowitz... I still love her voice as it always sounds beautifully pure and sparkling.<br />I would still higly recommend this recording, especially if you aren't learning Carmina Burana and you just want to listen to it.  It has definitely carved out it's own niche in the world of great performances.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I agree with the other reviewer.  I wanted to like this movie because I love musicals. The modern songs presented in an 1899 setting just didn't make sense.  Ewan McGregor, Star Wars is calling your name. He either sings loudly screaming or soft. There is not much contrast. I think if he got some singing lessons maybe he would be better.  I thought Nicole Kidman was beautiful but think maybe she should stick to nonsinging roles. Anyway, whoever conceived of this musical couldn't decide whether they wanted comedy or drama. It started off comedy with The Hills are Alive..from the Sound of Music and other comedic elements then they brought Nicole in as a French Courtesan dying of consumption. Sounds like they borrowed this from Camille(A great old movie from the past) and mixed it with Gigi( another great old movie from the past. If they had stuck with the drama of the movie from the beginnning and used new songs that would lend themselves better to the time period I think it could have been a great movie musical.  Is there any wonder that they don't make many musicals anymore? Visually this movie is beautiful.(The set is gorgeous) but for the rest, I give it one star. I wish it could have been better.
0743216385|5.0|Major Winters is a great leader.  The story is told beautifully and always entertaining and exciting.  You will also learn a lot about tactics, leadership, and unit management.  I read this book after watching Band of Brothers on HBO.  You won't be disappointed.
0792838068|5.0|Leaving Las Vegas isn't really about alcoholism.  It deals with it, it shows the effects of it but that's not what the film is about.  It's a typical love story between a man and woman in the prime of their lives.  Except he's an alcoholic and she's a prostitute.  The story isn't really Cage's either, it's more centered on Shue.  We learn about her as she talks to an unseen therapist throughout the film.  What's really astounding is how the two play the most ... roles - the drunk and the ... with a heart of gold - without any cliches.  The film itself has no cliches.  Some people have attacked the film becasue the stars are both attractive, but so what?  The film was shot independantly on Super 16 cameras so as not to compromise the book.  And because it was, Mike Figgis could have cast anyone he wanted to, he didn't need attractive or box office friendly stars for an indie film but these two embody their characters perfectly.  There isn't much else to say about the film.  It's better viewed than it is described.
0393317552|5.0|I have to admit I've never read any other book on this subject and I found it fascinating.  Diamond ignores the ideas that certain cultures advanced because they are intellectually superior than others.  In fact it is geograpy that in large part determined the course of history.  Diamond attempts to answer questions such as why did Europe conquer the Americas instead of the Americas conquering Europe? And why didn't the Chinese colonize America since they were technologically superior to Europe until the 15th century?  If you find either of these questions interesting, then you will find this book interesting.  Some of the reviewers suggest this is a boring book.  I will agree in one respect that Diamond spent to much of the book writing about New Guinea which I found a bit tedious, but all in all it was an excellent learning experience for me.
B000000W3G|5.0|this is honestly a necessity for any pumpkins fan, not just the hardcore fans. i wanted this box set for so long, and when i finally got it it was well worth the wait and the money. you'll find that the pumpkins' talents are even more amazing than you would have thought. billy corgan's song-writing is ingenious. everyone must get this set!
B00005RHGK|2.0|AAAARRRRGGHHH! What the? This movie really was not worth sacrificing a nap for. All I can say is that the actors can't save a movie when it's flying off a cliff. The actors were superb for not big name people. My plight is not with them...it's with whoever decided to help produce this flaming bag of dog ..... \\"Hey there's a body rapped in sheets and ropes that's really bloody...and they just got thrown down a well. I wonder if they're alive....we gotta go back!\\" No you don't. So many stupid moments! People just keep doing dumb stuff through the whole movie.....I wasn't even vaguely scared of this movie...and whoever was should step outta there sterile lives cause there clearly panicked by anything that moves (bug, lava lamps, flowing water. This was a really lame movie...at least the acting wasn't horrible.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I loved this Cd because of the song \\"wherever whenever\\". I think it has a great tone to all the songs in the cd. Well, all I can say is that she gives Colombians a good name. Viva Colombia!...
0780629450|5.0|I have nothing to add to other reviews, but that,... I like Shakespeare, I love Hamlet, and I simply adore this production. I have seen it 4 times already in cable.  I'm just waiting for the DVD to be released (I don't believe VHS image quality can fully deliver the brilliance of this staging)!
6302759110|2.0|Despite some good points (for example, it is definitely not boring), Francis Ford Coppola's film version of the legendary vampire tale may be the most overblown, pretentious horror film that had been made up to that time.  (Whether it has been surpassed since I cannot say.)  The film is a classic example of not knowing when to stop.  Everything is too loud, too colorful, too sumptuous.  Titling the film &quot;Bram Stoker's Dracula&quot; is in itself pretentious, as it is only slightly more faithful to the novel than most other film versions.  The novel certainly did not include any snickering sexual innuendo, or Dracula making an appearance as a hideous humanoid bat.  As Dr. Van Helsing, the great vampire fighter, Anthony Hopkins delivers a performance so overacted that it must be seen to be believed.  When we first encounter Dracula, he looks like a living mummy dragging a bridal train behind him and, when angry, he roars like a wounded rhinoceros.  When he becomes younger (after feeding on youthful blood), he looks like a hippy.  When Mina realizes the shocking truth about Dracula, she lightly pounds on his back with her fist.  (And I do NOT think this is supposed to be funny.)  In making this film, Mr. Coppola forgot an important fact --  anything that is so overblown cannot be taken seriously.
0062502182|2.0|Coelho's style in this didactic story is too blunt for people who enjoy subtly. For the story, Coelho clearly draws on ideas from modern occult religions (e.g., the importance of omens, the alchemist as wise man, the existence of an unspoken universal language, the Soul of the World), which are presented along side Christian ideas (page 117: &quot;It's not what enters men's mouths that's evil&quot; said the alchemist. &quot;It's what comes out of their mouths that is.&quot; [cf. Matthew 15:11]).  The book is also filled with platitudes that can be found in many self-help books today (page 143: &quot;There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.&quot;). But, if you find comfort and profundity in the idea that everything in the world is interconnected, you will probably like this book. If you find that idea rather uninspiring, regardless of whether it is true or not, you will probably find this book boring.<br />The most clever aspect of this simple book is how the author protects from doubt one of the main claims made in the story. It is stated over and over again in the story that the universe will help people achieve their Personal Legends (i.e., dreams). It also says that the Soul for the World will test us severely before we achieve our dreams. In other words, the universe will help you achieve your dreams, but it won't seem that way--in fact, it will seem the opposite. So if you doubt that the universe is helping you achieve your dreams, it is because you are being tested. If you achieve your dreams, the claim may appear true; if you have yet to do so, it is because you are still being tested. What objective evidence could be offered to show that this claim is false? This devise employed in The Alchemist is perhaps more cunning than clever. In fact, to say something is true but doesn't seem true is a common way that gurus at self-help seminars protect themselves from the occasional naysayer who demands a refund. &quot;Ifyou don't believe what the guru is teaching,&quot; the naysayer is told, &quot;it is only because you have yet to see the truth of it.&quot; <BR> <BR>Most of the people who love this book I imagine are ambitious unsatisfied souls who are starving for encouragement. More nourishing words can be found elsewhere. Two recent books that inspire with more nutrients are Let Your Life Speak by Parker Palmer and Living a Life that Matters by Harold Kushner. Like The Alchemist, these books don't pretend to have the Answer (no specific techniques for solving problems are given), but unlike The Alchemist they provide down-to-earth words of encouragement, albeit in a non-fiction format. May we all find peace in the Truth. ---cc
0446677450|3.0|I found this book to be very repetitive but informative. While reading this I ignored the tendency of the book to be quite repetitive and instead I listened to the Authors points and tried to learn from them. This book helped my to realize the mistakes my mother made with money. I have realized she is truly in &quot;the rat-race&quot;. It also helped my to realize the things my father has done right with money.<BR>I noticed when I discussed the book with people who had read it the ones who enjoyed it seemed to have parents that weren't the well-off money wise, and the ones who didn't enjoy it had parents who were more well off and had given them some knowledge about money. I personally felt like most of the information he reiterated numerous times I had always just thought of as common knowledge. But I did learn things I didn't know so I enjoyed the book. Also I enjoy the book because I learned something from it about my parents. But I only give it three stars due to his repetition.
B00004RFCM|3.0|While I agree with the other reviews that the content is superb, I could only give the set 3 stars because of its terrible transfer to DVD.  The quality was so bad (for DVD) as to be distracting.  This is unforgivable for a well known, well financed outfit like HBO.  This isn't Goodtimes video!
B00003CXZ1|1.0|Isn't it amazing to watch the depth of stupidity of Hollywood produced mass market movies?!  Angelina Jolie is starring in this fabulous example of one of these brainless Hollywood creatures.  While searching for hidden artifacts in Asian rainforest and Siberian taiga, the Tomb Raider lacks absolutely everything necessary to make even a parody on Indiana Jones type action.  The plot is messy, old and lacks originality.  The main heroes lack characters.  Even majority of computer game fans has reportedly been also disappointed. <br />It is not a rewarding task to write such a negative review.  However, watching Angelina Jolie in a summer shirt under unbuttoned coat in Siberia does not go any further than [breasts] watching anywhere in an office or on the street, but the latter is absolutely free and less time consuming.<br />The only good thing worth mentioning is the good visual effects, although the volume of them seems to emphasize the lack of real actors' play.
1577312082|5.0|In The Power Of Now, spiritual teacher Eckhart Tolle narrates his own audio program on compact disc, providing a personal guide to spiritual enlightenment which tells beginners how to truly be present in our lives and liberated from past and future concerns. An excellent, absorbing account.
B00005RYKV|5.0|A Japanese yakuza henchman (played by Kitano) named &quot;Brother&quot; came the States after his clan was destroyed in a mafia war back in Japan.  Here the Brother organised his friends into a clan and started a cruel war on local mafia families to win a space.  The newcomer is cruel and does not think twice before killing his rivals.  However, what makes this movie worth watching is natural looking Darwinist style violence and relationships within his band beautifully played by Kitano and his actors.<br />What always appealed me in Kitano's films is human interaction between central characters including the most negative ones.  The Brother is cruel, strong, and a good marksman.  He is not a kind of person you ordinarily would like to meet on a street.  However, he ultimately sacrifices his life to save Danny, his black companion, from the band of Italians.  But in the beginning of the movie those two characters had very few if any reasons to like each other after the Brother pokes Danny in the eye with a broken bottle, then cheats him in a game.<br />Another moving scene is when the Brother's right hand man sacrifices his life to persuade another local Japanese criminal ring to merge with the Brother's operation.  Simple, convincing and incomprehensible at the same time!  <br />I gave this movie five stars and highly recommend it to anyone interested in action.  This film is The Action itself!
B000022TSV|5.0|This in one of the most delightful (in fact the most delightful) opera movies I have ever seen. The first amazing thing is that there are no cuts in the score. <br />About the cast...well...incredible...<BR>Domingo sings Don Jose incredibly. No contemporary tenor is his equal. Carreras and Lima (the other 2 don jose on DVD) are just not as good as him. Domingo also has a good french accent...which is a must in this opera.<br />Migenes: well I can't understand some other reviewers who accused her of ruining the performance. I thought she was incredible. She is an amazing actress. Although she never sang carmen on stage, she has however a very deep understanding in the role...perfectly reflected in this movie.<br />The toreador (raimondi) and micaella are also good. Well..overall the cast is great ...and the decor is AMAZING...the opening scene is a bit brutal...but also...what can i say...the music in the prelude IS brutal and the sets are just following the music..isn't that opera???<br /> I highly recommend this DVD.
0446608955|4.0|Jamie was the daughter of a Baptist minister and Landon was the son of a Congressman. They came from two total different sides of town, and two totally different families but something happened their senior year that made all the difference. This is the story of their senior year, and it is told by Landon as an older man. He reflects on his senior year as the one that changed him, but all for the better. This book has been made into a motion picture which will be released to theaters on January 25th and is honestly, one of the best books I've ever read. It's truly, a book to remember.
B00005O5JV|5.0|This movie was another one in which I just could not stop laughing!!  The juxtaposition of the ridiculous against the backdrop of normalcy is what makes this movie so hilarious!! This movie has a pretty stupid plot if you think about it, but you don't watch movies like this to think--you watch them to laugh and have a good time.  And you will do plenty of that if you watch this movie!  I screamed with laughter at the downright goofiness of just about everything in this movie--from the dorky matching outfits worn by the chihuahua and Reese, to the ultra furry pillows on her bed, to the dance scene in the beauty parlor!  My favorite part was when Reeses's character walks into her first pre-law class surrounded by all of these uber-brainiacs with their uptight attitudes and two-thousand dollar laptops, and in all seriousness takes out this pink fluffy pen and this 3-inch tall pink furry, heart shaped notebook in which to take notes!!!  I almost choked on a piece of popcorn,  I laughed so hard!! The utter ludicrousness of this movie is what makes it work! Reese Witherspoon is a gem--she plays ridiculous comedy with such a straight face to the hilt--priceless!!! You almost get the feeling that the movie's producers KNOW how campy the movie is and are laughing right along with the audience.
B000002ACR|5.0|Another near perfect outgoing for the Byrds. I have this on record; i don't know about any of the songs past &quot;Why?&quot;. Speaking of &quot;Why?&quot;, why didn't the Byrds put the single version of that song on the album? What a bummer. But you won't mind after you've been thru the other shimmering classics preceding it. 'Nuff said about the smart alecky opening classic. Its the ones you never heard that you should have heard that drop the jaw, like &quot;Have you Seen Her Face&quot; and &quot;Thoughts and Words&quot;. Plenty of experimental acid stuff to tickle your ears too by way of &quot;Mind Gardens&quot; and &quot;CTA 102&quot;. How sheepish I felt when reading the othe reviews and lots of people said they hated &quot;Mind Gardens&quot;...at 17, that was my favorite tune on the record. Anyways, in my humble opinion, a &quot;No Skip Button&quot; recording.
B00005NWM3|3.0|First, the obvious: Nickelback's &quot;Silver Side Up&quot; will not be found on anyone's best of list for the year-nor the worst of list for the year. Nor will you find any music magazine staffer willing to call this album a classic. But what the heck? The album's OK:<br />Nickelback seems to have a problem with copying other people's ideas. Case in point: &quot;How You Remind Me.&quot; Great song, huh? Hey, I love the song too. You'd be hard-pressed to find a hater. But don't those &quot;yeahs&quot; sound familiar? I thought so. Lit's &quot;Miserable&quot; has the same &quot;yeahs,&quot; and in fact, they sound almost exactly the same! I won't say the rest of &quot;Silver Side Up&quot; is copying other people, but the creativity on this album suffers.<br />Nonetheless, there is some good stuff: &quot;Too Bad,&quot; &quot;How You Remind Me,&quot; and &quot;Good Times Gone&quot; are all great songs. It's hard to dislike &quot;Never Again,&quot; no matter how much you don't want to hear another frickin' song on domestic abuse (Garth Brooks' &quot;The Thunder Rolls&quot; is still the best out there). The album itself, for the most part, is enjoyable. But if you want creativity, Nickel Creek or Pennywise will knock out Nickelback.
B00000IGGA|4.0|Ok, Im not really a new fan, but new in the sense that a) I wasnt there for most of his early career,and b) I only own three records by him. So, I can't trash him like a hipster for rewriting himself or being comparatively uninventive on such a recent album by Waits. My unbiased ear hears: a revival in a graveyard, gospel music for drunks. To me, its a really good Waits record. He continues the percussive, sinister vibe of Bone Machine to my delight, since I really dug that record, and throws in enough snake oil tent preacher to make it just a bit different. You cant't help but be moved by &quot;House Where Nobody Lives&quot; and &quot;Georgia Lee&quot;-Waits has the ability, and has ever since Ive been listening to him, to make you misty, if not outright shed a tear. If you liked &quot;The Ocean Doesn't Want Me&quot; from BM, you'll enjoy his new foray into grim poetry with &quot;What's He Building in There?&quot;. Outright freakin' weird:&quot;Filipino Box Spring Hog&quot; and &quot;Eyeball Kid&quot;, the latter reminiscent of &quot;All Stripped Down&quot; on BM. So maybe it is a bit derivative, but it nevertheless is worth several replays.
B000002UB3|5.0|This has got some of the Beatles' greatest songs on here. That's probably why it's one of their more well known records. You have the happy, the weird, and the sad altogether. &quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&quot; however, catchy though it is, and quite funny, if you like that sort of humor, has got to be one of the most morbid songs this side of punk rock. A guy kills two people with his silver hammer. &quot;Bang Bang Maxwell's silver hammer hit her on her head, Bang bang, Maxwell's silver hammer assured that she was dead...&quot; other than that, it's quite good, and quite enjoyable. Worth a buy, definately.
B000002J09|5.0|I am only 17.I started listening to Led Zeppelin about a year ago.I really can`t get into their earlier work(I,II,III,IV),but i won`t say it is bad just because i don`t like it.If there are so many people who say that it is good,then it is worth listening to.As for Stairway,in my opinion it is THE best song ever written and it is the only song from this album i REALLY enjoy listening to.People say it is been overplayed.Well it`s certainly been overplayed in my CD player(700-800 times in last year)and i still can`t find anything wrong with it.At each listening it just sounds better and better.Anyway,for this song only i will give five stars.Buy it.You`ll probably like the songs i didn`t.
B000002UAR|4.0|I find the Beatles albums to be a source of good music and thoughtful lyrics. This album is no exception. The songs are great, the lyrics are interesting. But some of the songs are altogether too catchy. Yellow Submarine has got to be one of the most annoying songs in the HISTORY of rock and roll, simply because hardly anyone knows all the words. Elanor Rigby is a good song, but it's too catchy and can stick in your head for 48 hours or more if you're not careful. But, in short, this is a good album, if you don't mind getting songs stuck in your head. Beatles songs have always been good for that, so if you're a Beatles person, this album won't dissapoint.
B00005QZWI|5.0|LOTR's score has been and no doubt will continue to be compared with The Phantom Menace (because both employ the gothic choral effect) and Titanic (because one of the key themes in LOTR is done with similar instrumentation).  <br />These are merited comparisons, but I dare say Howard Shore has thoroughly outdone John Williams and James Horner.  The themes in LOTR are more likely to stick in your head than anything from TPM, (even the wonderful &quot;Duel of the Fates&quot;) yet LOTR never strays near the over-emotional pop style of Titanic.  <br />The high points on this soundtrack are indeed stratospheric achievements.  &quot;Many Meetings,&quot; &quot;The Bridge of Khazad Dum,&quot; &quot;The Great River,&quot; and &quot;The Breaking of the Fellowship&quot; are absolutely enthralling!!  Few pieces from an album of any genre have struck me so powerfully.  <br />Originally I read that this soundtrack was only good with the movie, that it was not very melodic or enjoyable on its own.  I also read complaints that there was too much pounding and booming and dark chanting, trying to copy Duel of the Fates but only inducing headaches.  I can assure both assumptions are quite incorrect!  I've had these magnificent melodies running through my brain since the first listen, and, though there are several battle scenes with fitting music, the tender points, such as Gandalf's fall, Sam's declaration of devotion to Frodo, Boromir's death...these themes are brilliant and impossible to resist.  They encompass the entire emotional spectrum from fear to hope and mourning to light-hearted joy.  <br />I could not be more pleased with Howard Shore's score.
B000002I25|5.0|Unfortunately, too much has been said about Jim Morrison, only one of many talented people in this world. He was quite a lyricist and singer, and showed considerable ability on this release, however, the listener should not get too carried away in worship. Few knew then, or know now how difficult of a person he was. In my opinion, drugs and alcohol destroyed him, and made him overly belligerent (that's an understatement.) That aside, his personality in the Doors music has remained interesting. I feel that this album is the group's finest. Robby Kreiger was one of the most underrated guitarists in rock history, and he showed that with an excellent chord selection for songs, and the ability to play many styles. Ray Manzarek exhibits an unparalleled soloing ability in the faster songs and in Light My Fire. Like the other Doors albums, there are many tracks less than 3 minutes that are obscure gems and do not play on the radio, such as the ballads Crystal Ship, and End of the Night, and Take It As It Comes. The End may be somewhat bombastic, but it shows a very hypnotic side to the band, and was one of the first combinations of rock and poetry, and one of the more successful, as the band provides a mysterious and climactic backdrop for Morrison's surreal poetry, and intense vocals. The album is a must buy for fans of rock music. Elements of blues, jazz, folk, and classical, all played convincingly by the musicians, along with interesting lyrics, and a good voice should be enough for even the biggest detractors of Morrison to buy the album.
0140544518|5.0|My 4 year-old daughter's preschool class read this book and she could not get enough of it, so we got a copy to see what all the fuss was about.  This is a fun book and will make adults laugh, too.  We read it almost every day right now and then we have to compare it to the usual tale. <BR>Share this with your preschooler or school age child--you won't be disappointed.
B00005U11Z|2.0|I was very dissapointed when I first played the dvd.  I do not know if the disk was defective or not but I got very little sound out of the center channel. At first I thought maybe a setting was incorrect on my system but after playing it on both systems I have and playing other dvd's I knew played correctly still not center channel.  Video quality good but without the true 5.1 sound I was very dissapointed.
0790729369|4.0|I won't go into details of the movie, many other reviews do this much more elegantly than I could but I will briefly describe the heart felt feelings I experienced during the film.<BR>I saw the movie and felt that I wanted to be them, people actually feeling that one true love in their life, and as a man, I connected with what was said by Robert (Clint Eastwood)'This kind of certainty comes but once in a lifetime', if we are very lucky, this certain love will smile upon us once in our lives.  For me I know it will never happen, like Francesca, I am married but I have not in my life, and probably never will experience  the emotion of those four remarkable days in Madison county, I will only see it through the eyes and life long intense feelings of these incredible people in this movie.  That is why this is such a special film for me, it may help some of us dream of a life more loved.
1577311760|5.0|if anyone is wondering what path to take in life, i suggest reading this. it is a simple book, with infinitive truths. i believe the reason that more peole don't tap into what tolle is saying is because it is so simple ad obvious.i could rave on for days about this book, but i won't bore u. read the book, understand its beauty, and u will understand (infinetely better than these meger words can describe)the beautifull spirtuality that is present.
B000005GYI|5.0|&quot;Clube da Esquina&quot;, or &quot;The Corner Gang&quot;, may look and sound like another Brazilian/Latin record on the surface, but that's where it all ends. The racially mixed cover portrait of children  sitting together should be a slight indication.<br />Tropicalia was a late 60's movement in Brazil where the limitations of then-traditional/popular music (i.e. brazileiras, bossa nova, batucada, choros, etc.) were charged around by the use of British/American pop-rock influences. Talents like Os Mutantes, Lo Borges, Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Milton Nascimento and others took the liberties of the above and created a music that, though poking fun &amp; rebellion at already set national musical values, was actually quite complimentary &amp; evolutionary. Though a lot of the older generation did not welcome it with open arms (this was 1966-1969), Tropicalia not only matured Brazilian music &amp; gave it an undeniable social awareness (though some sentiments did not settle well with the then-government and, as a result, some musicians/composers were jailed &amp; questioned about their lyrical content), but was also an important and underwritten chapter in psychedelic music.<br />Milton Nascimento &amp; Lo Borges' great project &quot;Clube Da Esquina&quot;, recorded in 1972, brings the whole Tropicalia movement full circle. Though all of the songs are sung in Portuguese (save for one, a haunting cover of &quot;Dos Cruces&quot;, sung in Spanish), there is an urgency and edginess in the music that is undeniable. Electric guitars, basses and organs are inescapable here and used in a fashion that not only brings a truly modern &amp; progressive twist to Brazilian folk forms, but an adventurousness &amp; unpredictability that is not usually associated with Brazilian music (at least, not with the United States).<br />All 21 tracks present a song cycle that expresses all of the country's music and social climate up to that point. All moods are direct throughout. Theycan range from the haunting (&quot;Tudo Que Voce Podia Ser&quot; &amp; &quot;Os Povos&quot;, the latter with a wonderful vocal performance from Alaide Costa), to psychedelic (&quot;Pelo Amor De Deus&quot;, &quot;Trem De Doido&quot;), to absolutely somber (&quot;Cais&quot;, &quot;Dos Cruces&quot; &amp; &quot;Ao Que Vai nascer&quot;) to even a few poppier &amp; playful  oments along the way. Yet, with what may be considered to be schitzophrenic to some, it's very consistent &amp; cohesive all throughout. And to also note that there isn't a bad track on here, also helps the above statement.<br />Plenty of great playing, singing and writing, too: Nascimento, brothers Lo &amp; Marcio Borges, Ronaldo Bastos, Toninho Horta, Eumir Deodato, Wagner Tiso, Robertinho Silva, Beto Guedes, etc. All strong players and, more importantly, contributors.<br />And yet, this is an album that ranks right up there in equal status alongside &quot;Piper At The Gates Of Dawn&quot;, the United States Of America's debut, Love's &quot;Forever Changes&quot;, Sly's &quot;There's A Riot Goin' On&quot; and even recent alternative masterpieces like Wire's &quot;Pink Flag&quot;, R.E.M.'s &quot;Murmur&quot; and even Radiohead's most progressive material. If you're a ProgRock head, you'll love this. If you're looking for something new and unheard of, this will NOT disappoint. If you want to expand your knowledge about Brazilian music, this is a great addition to your collection.<br />It's a powerful record. Plenty of talent, great songs and true artistic risk-taking. The only favor asked once you've been initiated to this album's charms is to spread the word to anybody who cares. You want to keep it a trade secret, but the music says otherwise.<br />A TRUE Latin-Rock MASTERPIECE.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Bruce Dickinson, the man who is defined as a human air raid siren, has returned to Iron Maiden, finally getting rid of the ill-fated Blaze Bayley.  Also back is old Maiden guitarist Adrian Smith, giving Maiden a three guitar lineup and making them fiercer sounding than ever.  The songs are fantastic as well; &quot;The Wickerman&quot;, &quot;The Nomad&quot;, &quot;Ghost of the Navigator&quot;, &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot;, and the title track are standouts, but &quot;The Thin Line Between Love and Hate&quot; sounds like nothing but a filler song just thrown onto here.  Other than that, Maiden is back, better than ever, and all is right with the brave new world.
0380973650|5.0|Where to start, is the pressing question.<br />The mythology is superb.  I'd recommend this novel most to someone with some versing in the classics and folklore, some basic ability to play a rousing good game of Spot the God.  One of the coolest little moments was discovering that Mr. Wednesday had a glass eye ...<br />You can see echoes in American Gods of a grand hero tale, an epic journey to an 'Other World', and you can see the grubby corners and edgy soul of a great American road novel.  Not Kerouac or Nabokov; Gaiman grasps his own voice, and with success.  It feels natural to have yellowing motels, small towns & trailer parks alongside ancient deities, divine trickery, and a grand battle.  (Though I feel rather shortchanged in the way Gaiman concluded the whole climactic god-battle scene.  It's more a book about the journey than the destination, one supposes.)<br />Having read some of his previous work, I think that with this novel he has reached this point where his curious, sharp prose, peculiar and rich bits of humor, and breezes of mortal insight come to a balance even more fruitful than his other material.<br />No wonder I finished this in less than two days.  Even Harlan Ellison liked it.<br />Read Smoke & Mirrors, his short fiction collection, and if you enjoyed it, then eat this up with ... /divine/ pleasure.
B000001FTD|5.0|Anthrax will go down in history as one of the most underrated, but greatest, thrash bands in metal history.  While they're thrash bretheren Metallica, Megadeth, and Slayer achieved more success commercially than Anthrax ever did, this is the definitive thrash album.  The riffs are fast and furious, and Charlie Benante's insane drumming is what carries the album from beginning to end.  A classic album any fan of metal or thrash should own.
052594527X|4.0|A brilliant first novel by Chevalier, &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; is literary fiction at its best.  <br />Griet is a delicately crafted character coming-of-age in a difficult time and situation.  She is mysterious, intelligent, and kind...all traits which at times enthrall and at others befuddle her family and friends.<br />17th Century Delft is a place where plagues still happen, maids do not speak before being spoken to, and marriage is a sacrament of financial rather than emotional importance.  It is also a period characterized in Dutch Art History by the representation of genre paintings and landscapes, both of which were subjects seldom selected by Vermeer, who instead concentrated on personal experience.  Chevalier works magic with the elusive personal life of this painter and is able to make the painting &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; come alive to the reader of the book.<br />My only advise to readers is to consult a Name Dictionary or else listen to the audio version...the names are not pronounced as they are spelled and I was quite surprised to hear the difference.<br />I am a reader's advisory librarian and have yet to recommend this book to anyone and hear that it was not enjoyed.  This is truly a magnificent first book by Chevalier.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Michael Bay  made this film having no political or philosophical agenda to bash his audience over the head with.   If a film maker wants to please critics, this is a big mistake when making a war picture.  If he wants to make a great, classic war picture, then this approach is a stroke of genius.  <br />What person of my generation can honestly say he knew or cared who Jimmy Doolittle was before they saw this film?  Not me.  Nor did I know the impact of this act of war on the pre-WWII generation.  <br />Micheal Bay's goal obviously was not to present a cold, objective view of the events surrounding Pearl Harbor; had he done so people would probably have complained that he'd ripped off Tora Tora Tora. The goal here is to pay tribute to those who died, and those who emerged as heroes from this History making event.   <br />Critics seem to miss this somehow, or maybe view such a goal as not being worthwhile.  I disagree.  <br />Love it or hate it,  thanks to Bay and Bruckheimer there is a new generation who will honor the admonition to &quot;Remember Pearl Harbor.&quot;  That in and of itself is enough to earn this film a five star rating.
0525946284|5.0|This book was very enjoyable.  I do like reading WW2 stories especially about intelligent, brave women.  I would have liked to believe that this story was actually based on a true story. People like that certainly deserve lots of praise.  What an entertaining way to tell their story.
B000002JPA|5.0|Dream Theater is one of my main inflences in music, besides the obvious Pink FLoyd. I had never heard keyboard playing like that before untill i had heard this album. Yes Keith Emerson and Rick Wakeman have to be the two greatest keyboardists alive, but something was different about Kevin Moore's style. The other thing that hooked me was Mike Portnoys drumming. The tight feel, and complexity of his drum style is just amazing. James Labrie intrigued me a lot, with his operatic style vocals. Haven't heard anyone song like that since Geoff Tate or Bruce Dickinson. John Pettucci is awesome. He's so smooth, and his guitar solos just rise. John Myung is a great bass player. The best one i've ever heard. This is the first DT album i ever got, and will be always one of my favourite albums.

B00005JA2B|5.0|Actually, this album is awesome! The only bad track would have to be the Cheyenne Anthem. Carry On Wayward Son is a good song, but not as good compared to Magnum Opus (best track), Miracles Out of Nowhere, or oOpus Insert. Steve Walsh is a good keyboardist, but the man of this album would have to be Kerry Livgren. This album will not disappoint you.

B000002UEB|5.0|Every song on this album just pours out great emotion. Not to mention the technicality and great orchstration by Michael Kamen. This album was very influenced by Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot;, but it's heavier and not as dark (if dark at all). If you get any Ryche get this album, it will blow you away!!
B00003CXCS|3.0|I've often wondered what this show (both the stage and movie version) would have been like, had Oscar Hammerstein 2nd written the book, and not just the lyrics. Unfortunately, the movie gives us even less of what the Broadway version gave us - two of the best songs from the stage version, &quot;How Can Love Survive,&quot; and &quot;No Way To Stop It&quot; have been cut - albeit with a slightly less saccharine narrative (here penned by Ernest Lehman). The authors of the stage version, Howard Lindsay and Russell Crouse, were attached to the project before R&amp;H, at the behest of the ultimate Broadway gamine, Mary Martin, and her (no pun intended) martinet/producer/manager/husband, Richard Halliday. Rodgers and Hammerstein came on board late in the game (after the lackluster debut of &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot;) only to supply the score.<BR>     This DVD provides us with a world of information - information that has Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews vehemently stating that the show, before Lehman's adaptation, had to lose a lot of the maudlin qualities [that people still complain about] the stage version had. <BR>      It's nice to see most of the original cast, and director Robert Wise - and Lehman - chatting about the production. There is a lot of useful information here; not just about this particular movie, but about the [soon-to-be] end of the successful Hollywood musical. I give this DVD high marks for its extra-curricular content, but not for the movie. Call me what you will, but I still say that this show would have been better if Hammerstein (the author of &quot;Show Boat,&quot; &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; &quot;Carousel,&quot; &quot;The King and I,&quot; and the co-author (with Joshua Logan) of &quot;South Pacific&quot;) had written the show instead of Lindsay &amp; Crouse. Still, &quot;Edelweiss,&quot; not only the last lyric written by Hammerstein, is one of their best songs - a simple but wonderful waltz by Rodgers (his trademark), and a simple but poeticlyric by Hammerstein.

B000007492|1.0|What a rip-off.<br />This disc opens with &quot;School&quot;, then proceeds to mirror - RIGHT DOWN TO THE RUNNING ORDER - the previous compilation (A&amp;M 25th Anniversary Series &quot;Classics&quot; volume 9)<br />This band had fewer than 10 top-40 hits. It's inexcusable to leave ANY one of them off. It's downright criminal that the beautiful ballad &quot;My Kind Of Lady&quot; from the &quot;Famous Last Words&quot; album is left off this and the previous collection.<br />I know the band wasn't all about singles and chart hits, but this track deserves to be on any &quot;best of&quot; or retrospective of the band.
B00005RFAI|4.0|Pink is just awesome!!  I loved her 1st CD, and i love this one...but they sound nothing alike!!  This one doesn't have all those man hating songs (although, those are great songs when you're mad at someone!  hehe)  it's obvious that she writes from her heart, i love it!!
0312932081|4.0|Ender's Game was tedious reading.  However...  it's an original story with a great ending.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|In the beginning, I was enthused that director Baz Luhrmann was going to make a movie musical, considering the cinematic flair and emotional intensity, and surprising humor of his previous outings. &quot;Strictly Ballroom&quot; A story where much of the character's emotions were told through dance. Then there was &quot;William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet&quot; A retelling of the quintessential love story, seamlessly set in our time. Both of these films were dazzling achievements in artistic cinema. And a musical would've been a thrilling next step for Luhrmann. But this overwhelming feeling of trepidation hit me when I realized what would be in the film. <br />One fact about me is that I'm a fanatic of musicals, If you look at my previous reviews you will see that. Fact of the matter a real musical has original tunes. When I heard that &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; would use a compilation a modern day pop tunes and that the compilation would include the putrid, festering presence of Music industry courtesans Christina Aguilera, Mya, Pink, and Li'l Kim (Learn to spell, Kim). Plus the fact that I had never forgiven Ewan McGregor, for the atrocities that were &quot;Star Wars: Episode One&quot;, and &quot;Eye of the Beholder,&quot; not even &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; could save my opinion of him. But the time came when I noticed the mixed reception that audiences and some critics had given it. Realizing I could not go by those opinions (usually I side with the critics). I inevitably had to rely on my own. I went to go see it, finally. And thank god I did. what a fool I was to doubt Mr. Luhrmann's artistic vision.<br /> The opening of &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is a bit of a tease. It starts out to be serene and docile as the camera zooms through a scratchy, black and white street of turn-of-the-century Paris and up into the Window of a dishevled Christian (Ewan MacGregor, who redeemed himself with this one, with his most energetic, and touching performances). But then the story begins with Christian arriving in Paris and almost immediately falling in with the Bohemian revolution with a dwarf Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo showing in his performance, that big things come in small packages.) and the sordid world of the Moulin Rouge. Upon arrival to the Moulin Rouge, in the film we're pratcially invited to this wild, surreal party where the clientele appropriately sing &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; whilst the &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; tempt them in with &quot;Lady Marmalade.&quot;(Mercifully Luhrmann didn't include the actual appearances of the aforementioned music industry trolips.) Suddenly in enters Jim Broadbent and his flambuoyant brillance as Rouge Owner Harold Zidler (Who is at his best in this film with the hilarious revamped rendition of Madonna's classic &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;). Soon the party enters into a CanCan dance filmed and edited with a striking vibrancy, and intesity that in which could only be done in a Bazmark production. It begins to go faster and faster until down from above comes Satine, the Sparkling Diamond (Nicole Kidman basking in her natural glamour and surprisingly powerful singing voice). Swinging high above on a trapeze.<br />This entire opening sequence completely assaulted my senses and soon upon it's completion I was putty in this movie's paws. But soon the movie progresses to a more serious tone. Satine becomes contractually bound to The Duke, played by M:I 2's Richard Roxburgh. At first you think The Duke is just a clueless schmuck, but soon becomes intimidating upon his realization of Christian and Satine's romance. Roxburgh effortlessly achieves that transition in the character. <br />Baz Luhrmann's directing manages to deliver the bohemian messages of beauty, freedon, truth, and love, and succeeds in irking the audiences emotions. Especially the tragic finale (which is wisely revealed in the beginning of the film to avoid the shock, and to brace the audience for the inevitable.) Luhrmann also manges to unveil new hidden talents in all of his leads that were never shown in their previous films. I haven't seen a director do that since Sam Raimi made Keanu Reeves actually ACT in &quot;The Gift.&quot; Though I will say that the lack of originality in the songs and the plot almost brought it down but fortunately the songs fit perfectly with the incredible orchestration and though the storyline is unoriginal it is played extremely well. But I still felt that when it came to recent movie musicals &quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot; succeeded with far less effort.<br />Nevertheless this is still one of the most entertaining films of the year and one of the few great movies to come out of the WORST summer in cinema history.
B00000K19E|5.0|in my opinion this is one of the best movies of all time.non stop action from beginning to end.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|If you though &quot;Shrek&quot; was a Disney/Pixar meeting of the mind, you must be thinking of &quot;Monster Inc.&quot;. This is Dreamworks: SKG<BR>latest animated movie to be released. And it's makes a cute adventures for the kids and a pretty good satire on fairy tale movies for the adults.<br />The movie begins when Shrek (Meyers), a not-so-friendly orge, founds out that Lord Farquad (Lithrow) had dumped a few fairytale creatures in this swamp. Shrek and a unstopping talking donkey (Murpy) goes straight to Lord's home, Durloc, to get this swamp back, but they had to recause the Princess Fiona<BR>(Diaz) from a dragon guarding castle. <br />You can easily guess what's Princess Fiona sercet this, but that's the only flaw in this movie. I give it Amazon's highest rate of 5 stars.
B00000K19E|5.0|I think this movie has the hottest ppl in it! The hottest was definatly Keanu Reeves! It was a thriller and very, very exciting 2 watch! I can't wait till the 2nd 1 comes out! I would Marry Keanu Reeves, he was so good in this film!
B000002IHU|3.0|This is a good metal cd that represents the state of  L.A. metal during this time. Invasion contains the classics Lay It Down and Your In Love, but lacks the overall wallop packed by Out of the Celler, and has more filler. This is a good cd to help complete your collection, but is their last good album.
B0000025T6|5.0|I have always loved Springteens lyrics and vocals but thought that the music behind him was too glittery. Take for example the keyboards in &quot;Born In The USA&quot;. So I was worried that since this album came out in '82, that it would be too cheesily polished. It blew me away to hear track after track of excellent acoustic songs. Nebraska is a gritty, black-and-white movie that is at once creepy and heartbreaking. I immediatley recognized the true events that the title track is based on.(The same events were the basis for the Martin Sheen film &quot;Badlands&quot; and propably inspired &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot;) Nebraska is excellent. And this is coming from someone who can be critical of Springsteen without feeling guilty of blasphemy.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|This australian epic by director Baz Luhrmann is part one of his &quot;Red Curtain&quot; trilogy.  This three part series portrays love in three different ways; through dance in Strictly Ballroom, through spoken word in 1996's Romeo and Juliet(the one with Leonardo Dicaprio and Claire Danes), and lastly, through song in 2001's Moulin Rouge starring Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor.  All three films are in my top 5 list and will be in yours as soon as you see them, but when you do, please see them in order!!<BR>       This beautifully done picture will make you laugh, cry and fall in love!  Giving away the plot would destroy the movie, so I won't.<BR>     It is true, some critics don't like the films, call them mellodramatic and so on, but fankly, these critics obviously don't understand the genious behind them.  If you long for love in the pit of your soul, the essence of our being, you'll love all three.<BR>   This is my favorite movie, so please rent it and if you love it as much as i do, buy it!
B00005UK1F|5.0|Everone who like metal, doom and rock music should own this. It's the most exciting and innovative music i've heard for years. It just feels great listening to it. Do your self a favour and go buy it.
B00005RYL9|5.0|The wait is almost over! The first (and the best, as rated by most) movie in the Highlander saga is about to be released as a 2-disc set with completely new Dolby Digital and DTS audio mix and a much better video transfer. The previous DVD versions of the movie lacked the audio-visual quality, most dvd fans crave for. In fact, in my opinion the movie really deserved a good audio mix, for it is packed with some great music by Queen and I hope the new version contains an isolated music track as well! <br />The Immortal Edition will be packaged in a limited edition tin box, a feature Anchor Bay Entertainment is known for. With a second disc full of extras, this edition is a release no Highlander fan should miss.<br />&quot;There can be only one&quot;, and it seems this is THE ONE!!
B00003CXTG|4.0|I really enjoyed Pearl Harbor because of the special effects, but without the great plot, they wouldn't have mattered. I thought the actors and actresses chosen for the film were great. They delivered excellent performances and I actually understood what, with some exceptions, really happened on that fateful December day.
6304346107|5.0|I love this version of Emma. It is a shame that it is so overlooked due to coming out shortly before a much larger production. The talented Kate Beckinsale is charming as the rich, spoilt but lovable Emma Woodhouse and she really carries the film. The supporting actors are solid and well cast, especially, Prunella Scales as Miss Bates and Mark Strong as Mr Knightley. Costumes and scenery are well done and it captures the essential Englishness evident in Jane Austen's work. It is far more accurate and serious compared to the 1999 film version with Gwyneth Paltrow and should stand as the ultimate adaptation of Emma.
B00005B4GU|1.0|I bought this CD a few months back and it's terrible.  I could barely stand to listen to it...got rid of it as soon as possible.
B00005221L|5.0|The best action of schwarzenegger. Picture and sound quality is so good. This is a &quot;must have&quot; item for schwarzenegger and sci-fi fantasy fans. Although it looks like a war movie, it's a horror show.  Watch it.
B00005TT77|1.0|I recently purchased this album on impulse.  The idea of all of these great artists (I have albums from every artists on this compilation) doing the music of the greatest band in the history of music was too much to resist.  Unfortunately it's disappointing.  The songs are almost all straight forward remakes of Beatle tunes without any of the fun and energy the Beatles put into them.  The few attempts at reworking the songs and making them the artist own either fail or come just short of success.  It is a major disappointment.
B00003Q43A|5.0|My six year old son watched Indepedence Day and was terrified of the aliens (scenes).  The documentary on disc 2 about how the aliens were filmed helped him really understand that this is just a movie.  Also the documentary about the minature cities and the White House reinforced the concept that this is just a movie and not real life.  He did not have nightmares after the movie.  Thank you for showing us how the movie was made.
6305176299|5.0|This is one of favorite movies of all times.  Truly this is better than the sequal. Don't buy the second one, this is the better of the two. With Keanu Reeves as the head man, its worth it. Good movie, a lot of suspense, and action too. Avoid the traffic and get this movie cause what you going to do, hot shot?

B00005R87Q|4.0|This movie rocks, I never so many imports in one movie. I have to say its better than &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot;. The actions scenes are entense, the races are great and I think the final part was  a bit suspense when Diseal trash into the truck. This movie makes the import cars look better and proves who has the better cars in this flick.  They need to make more movies like this. Plus the extras in the DVD are good and the Music videos make it much better to get into the movie.
0812550706|5.0|Science fiction is all too often looked upon as an inferior form of literature. True, there is plenty of trash in SF, but also in romance and mystery and those are rarely refered to with the same contempt. One of my english teachers once said (and I apologize in advance if my quote is not a hundred percent accurate) that only a realistic novel (i.e takes place in a realistic setting) can achieve a high level of emotional effect, because the reader can only identify with the characters if they are placed in a setting we are personally familiar with.<br />Ha.<br />For any of you who might share this opinion, Ender's Game is the place to start your re-education. A masterpiece, one of the finest books written in the last fifty years, an absolute essential reading for all - I'll go as far as to say, especially those who are not heavy SF fans, because if you're a heavy SF fan and you haven't read it you're in trouble. Suffice to say that it won both the Hugo and the Nebula awards, and that it absolutely deserved them. Ender's Game is the most human, most touching piece of science fiction I've read, a perfectly flowing novel, the kind that is painful to put down. I wouldn't like to give too much of the plot away, but I would say that it takes plaee in outer space, and it does in some way involve aliens; and it's completely not what you might expect.<br />Orson Scott Card is a wonderful author, and of his books that I've read Ender's Game is most likely the best. Three sequels exist, all of them fantastic, but Ender's Game is by far the most accessible. The second book in the series, Speaker for the Dead, is also a masterpiece, but it's involves much more 'sci-fi philosophy' which some may find more appealing than the more psychological emphysis of Ender's Game and others may find somewhat tiresome. The others in the series, Xenocide and Children of the Mind, continue the direction the second part took and wander further off to long, complex phylosophical-scienific theories. Those two are certainly not for everyone. Ender's Game is, and it's the place to start. I've said enough. Read it now.
B00004WC6J|5.0|This Album allows you to penetrate into Sylvian's world with sophisticate feeling and calm. Let you ear be gently flood over the horizon of words and notes and among the different styles David seems to manage with great and inner wisdom. One of the best opportunities for your music collection.
B00005JKT8|4.0|I thought all the actors were very good. I usually do not like romantic comedies but I do like Hugh Jackman and Movies about time travel. I thought this film was very cute and lighthearted.  Good movie to see after a hard day of work.
0316548189|5.0|Reading this epic storyline of a triumphant &quot;freedom-fighter&quot; puts one's place in<br />perspective in searching for a meaning in life that will bring lasting, cooperative,<br />congenial, peaceful, justly change to a world that is haunted by the repercussions<br />of colonialist imperialism.  For those who say one wo(man) can't change anything<br />in the vast bureaucratic machinery of the modern age, one learns that it is not the<br />oppressor and enemy you must dwell on, but on motivate and will yourself to<br />make the essential sacrifices necessary in giving your all out commitment in<br />fighting through the proper means for your necessary cause.<br />Here is a man, who in his own birthland was treated with 4th class status (whites,<br />colored, Indians, Blacks respectively), being mind and body-controlled of his<br />thoughts, political affiliations, location of domecile, location and field of work,<br />where and by what he could travel to, biased court, administrative, and police<br />enforcement, and numerous other inhumane treatment.  He didn't let these vastly<br />hampering, seemingly insurmountable logistics sway him as he remained steadfast<br />in his courage, loyalty, and dedication to righting the many wrongs of his society.<br />Mandela didn't do it alone and he stresses his full allegiance to the ANC through-<br />out, as well as to people such as his prison-mate of 27 years Walter Sisulu, his<br />dependable lawyer Joe Solvo, the ANC president in exile Oliver Thembo, and to<br />a large but not always clear-cut extant F.W. De Klerk, as well as others.  Mandela<br />retains and is proud of his Trankei roots and heritage and of the legendary stories<br />of accomplishment that the Zulu's of the past and other cultural phenomena that<br />his people had accomplished.  He respects where he comes from (&quot;I believe<br />everyone should have a house within sight of where they were born&quot;), yet doesn't<br />let that hinder his open--mindedness and the rational right choices one must make<br />that will conflict with one's past and present family, acquaintances, and affiliations.<br />Nothing could put into words the vast sacrifices and pits the freedom-fighters<br />against apartheid travailed through, with the numerous murderous state-sponsored<br />rampages of mass-murder, the callousness of police brutality and prison life (i.e.<br />descriptions of early conditions of bed blankets, excrement facilities, food offerings,<br />heart-stopping induced labor, limitations of visits, symbolic geographical seperation<br />of Robben Island, etc.) are just hard to understand and muster in one's imagination.<br />Just as in Nazi Germany and in other police-state, totalitarian regimes, he showed<br />and clearly stated that it was not just the oppressed who were limited and stomped<br />upon their freedoms, but also the oppressor.  One gets a tremendous respect for the<br />power of authority and the need of a countries people to continually check up and<br />make the requisite changes to make the government accountable by, for, and to the<br />people.<br />Nelson Mandela ends this book not with a conclusion, as to freedom-fighter, revo-<br />lutionary, justice seeker ever ends his journey, but with satisfactory contentment<br />for what one has accomplished by reaching one peak, but also seeking that there are<br />many more mountains to trudge and that each vista will offer a beautiful, connec-<br />ting view that will only encourage to push one forward to gain and achieve better<br />and greater views till one reaches that highest and most colorfully fertile of peaks.<br />Altough this book did not reveal that much of the inner twists and knots one must<br />confront in building one's successful campaign to fight an injustice (i.e. Autobio-<br />graphy of Malcom X much better in that respect), it gives you a vast appreciation<br />of what is  possible in a long-lived and dedicated life.  Mandela covers a lot of the<br />rudimentary descriptions of his ever-changing, amorphous, hazy, disruptive, chain<br />-bound environment, which many time limits his chances, as well of course his<br />memory of the vast and intricate changes he went through, at expounding upon his<br />inner turbulences and turmoil.<br />In the end, Mandela leaves a lasting legacy of truly and man of and for his people,<br />putting his dear Mother and wife behind (his only, but tragically irreparable regret)<br />for the well-being of his greater family, the inhabitants of the land known as South<br />Africa.
